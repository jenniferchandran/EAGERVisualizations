Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583084,"Tomorrow is my last day of work. I'll be driving into the office for the last time, and before i know it, my fifteen year technology career will be wrapped up and behind me. That's not to say that I won't work in the tech world again, and certainly not to imply that it was ""all for naught."" On the contrary, I struggled with the decision to leave precisely because I had a good thing going. It wasn't my desire to thru hike the AT that made me quit; it was my desire to search for something that would make me feel more alive on a day to day basis. My job has become too ""safe,"" and I have reached a point where I know that to grow as a person and live the life of adventure that I crave, I have to look for something new. 
Thru hiking the AT is a happy byproduct of that decision, and a big part of wiping the slate clean and starting anew. I have been wanting to attempt a thru hike for years. My wife and I have talked about it a lot. I have lived vicariously through others' trail journals, and read the books that inspire hordes of hikers every year to reach for their dreams, such as Bill Bryson's amusing tale ""A Walk in the Woods,"" and David Miller's classic account of his own thru hike in ""AWOL on the Appalachian Trail."" When I decided to change my career, I knew that this could very well be my one clear shot at making the trek myself. My time had somehow come about!
I will be doing the hike alone. I wish my wife could come, but it seems this journey is meant to happen the way it is playing out, and so that is the way it is going to be. I'm at peace with that, though I will miss her, my family and friends quite dearly. I'll also miss Lucy, the cat in the photo. We adopted her over a year ago as a companion for our older cat, Hallie. Hallie passed away recently, which was hard on us but has also left Lucy getting used to being an only cat (for now). She has a special bond with me and follows me around like a little dog, so it is tough to leave her as I know she won't understand why I am gone. That said, I am hopeful it will give her some good solid bonding time with Mom while I'm gone. I promised to bring back to her tales (she asked for tails) of mice crawling around the shelters i'll be spending some time in. The trail calls on. I'm getting this journal set up with some photos and gear videos that give a breakdown of the gear I will start the trail with. If you don't see the videos yet, please check back for those links as I am working on them currently. I'm sure I will make a good many adjustments along the way as things prove to be unnecessary, not quite what I need, etc. I'm looking forward to that process! I do not intend to use mail drops for food. I'll resupply along the way as I need to.I will do my best to keep up with posts along the way to document my journey, though I doubt I will be able to daily. I will probably back post from time to time, partly because I'm quite sure i won't have a cell phone signal much of the time, and partly because I just want to unplug - that's part of the journey!I have a lot to do before I leave, so I will end this post here. Tomorrow at the office will be bittersweet, for sure. I have no expectations of this journey. Some folks have asked me: ""do you think you will make it to Maine?"" I guess the honest answer is yes, I'd like to think I will make it. I think everyone who sets about a goal wants to think that he or she will achieve it. But making it to Katahdin is only a tiny part of this journey for me. Katahdin is but a symbol of my larger goal, which is to do the hike because it is there to do, to experience the unbridled beauty of nature, to enjoy an adventure in life and to learn from it, to be confident that I can indeed live life the way I want to live it, and hopefully to grow as a person along the way. Those are the real goals, and if I'm open to the experience, whether I make it to Maine is of little consequence. I view this opportunity as a gift, and I only want to try to be open to all of its lesson, to savor every moment, and to be grateful for the experiences I will have along the way. But yes - I want to make it to Maine! :-) Join me for the journey?",,View Entry,"Feb 19, Mon",0
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583157,"My first day of “(f)unemployment” was busy with prep for the journey. It felt good to be able to focus and knock things off the list. I also had time to reflect on things thus far and the kindness of others. My team at work pooled together and gave me a lovely card and a going away gift, which quite thoughtfully included a deck of “don’t die out there” playing cards! Awesome...and sage advice indeed! That is certainly one of my goals. The gift and sentiments expressed were so thoughtful and made me emotional, thinking of all that we had been through, the thick and the thin, as a team. They are incredible folks and I was lucky to work with them. 
This got me thinking about trail magic. On the trail, trail magic is the random acts of kindness that strangers do for folks on the trail. For example, my wife and I hiked a section of the AT through the Roan Highlands last year and came across some bottles of water and a sign that a Boy Scout troop had left for hikers in the trail. Sometimes trail magic is food; sometimes it is a ride somewhere. It’s the completely selfless acts of kindness that can otherwise sometimes feel rather rare in the world today. And yet before the trek has even started, I have already begun to see and experience trail magic! The first instance was my local gym, LivFitness, here in Atlanta. When the owner, Jason, found out I was preparing for a thru hike, he did something incredibly nice for me that, quite honestly, he didn’t have to do. I can’t help but think that the trail brings out the best in people. It teaches us by magical example. It allows us to feel the presence of something bigger than us. I really look forward to learning what I can from the trail magic I am sure I will encounter along the way. 
Time to hit the hay. Tomorrow will be full of prep and hopefully pack weight check! I fear the poundage!!",,View Entry,"Feb 21, Wed",0
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583233,"Today was a busy day of chores, but a beautiful and unexpectedly warm day in Atlanta. Temperatures reached the upper 70s and it truly felt like the end of spring. It was enough to push the red buds (a type of tree) on my street to coyly show signs of blooming. Lucky for me, most of my chores were prepping the yard for my absence, so I spent much of the day outside in the balmy air tending to plants, pulling weeds, and laying down a nice blanket of pine straw. I just love the way a fresh layer of pine straw looks! It reminds me of the pine forests I grew up playing in as a kid in the south.I answered some more questions about my trip today, one of which was ""do you have a trail name?"" For those of you who aren't familiar with this, a trail name is a hiking nickname that is traditionally chosen for you by other hikers while on the trail. Some people choose their own trail names, but the tradition is that it is bequeathed to you. I do not have a trail name yet! I intend to embrace the tradition and let other hikers bestow one upon me on the trail. I'm actually pretty excited about this, but of course i AM hoping it is not something horrible, like Sir Poops-A-Lot, or Night Drooler, or Which Way.While I don't have a trail name (yet), I do have a pretty cool hat (i think, anyway) that I am going to wear on the hike. When I was getting my gear together, I wanted a new mesh hat that would be light, well ventilated, and would help keep sun off of my face. My old mesh hat doesn't fit my head (i have a big noggin...) when I have a lot of hair, so definitely not good for the trail. This new one has plenty of room for my man skull. The real kicker for me was the space cat eating a taco and a piece of pizza. I mean, come on! I love cats, love tacos, love pizza, and if you can put all of that in outer space, well that's just something special! It may be a little non-traditional, but in a way it is not just my hiking hat; it is also my trail mascot! One way or the other, it's coming along for the ride. Wasn't there a movie called ""So This is 40?"" Maybe I should watch that....I also spent today finalizing my food choices and prep for my first 4-5 days. I will try and post on that tomorrow. This space cat needs to get to bed.",,View Entry,"Feb 22, Thu",0
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583267,"it’s getting closer! With two days left before I hit the trail, things are definitely getting real. The excitement is mounting, my checklist of to-do items has dwindled to just a few. Sometimes I feel like I have to pinch myself that it is really happening! Yesterday I spent time organizing food for my first 4 days. I’m grouping everything by days in gallon ziplock bags marked by day number. It keeps things organized and I think it will help to dissuade me from eating it forward. In my head, “eating it forward” is a descriptor for when I eat too much food one day and don’t have enough the next, so then I keep kicking the hunger can down the road in hopes of making it to resupply earlier. I guess it’s kind of like “paying it forward,” except that’s about spreading good karma and eating it forward is about gluttony and lack of self control. Anyway, like I said, it works in my head. So, as you can see from the photo I’m goong to be getting up close and personal with a lot of tuna and cliff bars. Good stuff. I also had a few Mountain House ready-to-eat meals laying around (chili mac is the best!), so I’ll be a tad on the gourmet side the first week. Yum! After that, it will be a lot more of the dollar Knorr rice sides for me. I like rice a lot and I’m not a particularly finicky eater, so those will work well for me. My food bag feels so heavy.... I am debating whether to bring a little extra since I have it and just carry the weight, or just leave it since my first resupply at Neels Gap is not far away. I’ll decide tomorrow....As part of my weight decisions today, I swapped out a balaclava and handkerchief for a buff. The buff is lighter and can substitute for both, so I’m  excited about that. If you did view my gear video, I made that prior to the swap so it is not completely current.It was very warm again today. I did some more yard work and it was wonderful just listening to the birds sing. There is something so cheerful about birdsong.Everyone has been so kind about this trip. I really appreciate the comments and support in my guest log! You all are awesome! I said goodbye to some friends today, and everyone was full of encouragement and excitement for me. I’m so lucky to have such nice people in my life!Monday will be here soon and the adventure will begin! I’m glad I still have two days to spend with my wife, as I will miss her dearly. And Lucy the cat of course :-)",,View Entry,"Feb 23, Fri",0
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583346,"No picture today, but I wanted to post a few thoughts. First, a shout out to Beaker - thank you for the support, and to the others who have posted in the guest book, and for the many, many messages I have received. It means a lot to me and I do appreciate it! Unfortunately, with this site I do not see an easy way to click on those messages and do a short reply, but please know that I do see them, read them, and appreciate them! Also, on another note, please excuse typos on these entries. I have to type them in from my phone, so the fat finger effect is going to kick in from time to time. I’m not used to typing so much on a phone.... After the trail I think my fingers and wrists will be just as strong as my legs!Yesterday and today were fun. I spent as much time with my wife as possible and finished my packing. On Saturday we did a little pre-anniversary celebrating and went to an event. I’m almost afraid to type this because it is not going to paint me in a good light, but here goes: I took my wife Gillian to Monster Jam for our anniversary. Yup. For those of you who know what that is, I’ll just let that sink in. I promise I have a good explanation. For my friends overseas and any others who don’t know, it’s a monster truck competition. Imagine a normal truck with huge wheels. Then think about adding a McDonalds factor by supersizing it until it’s so massive you need a ladder to get inside it, and it rolls over other normal size cars like they are tiny cockroaches. Then, take said vehicle and paint it a gaudy color and give it a threatening or silly name, like Gravedigger, or Big Kahuna. Draw some flames or skulls on it and maybe put a few spikes on it. That’s a monster truck. They race each other jumping over huge dirt ramps and do crazy freestyle stunts, crushing cars, flipping over, and in the end, most of them ended up crunched and smoking, leaving their bits, bobs, and bumpers strewn about. All of this happened in Atlanta’s new Mercedes Benz stadium, to cheering crowds of loyal fans. Ok, so I know you’re probably thinking “dude, DUDE.....WHY? Why would you think it’s a good idea to take your wife to monster jam for your anniversary? Why?” That’s a fair question. First thing you should know is we like to do things, to have different and new experiences. This was definitely a curiosity and a one-and-done check on the bucket list. The second important thing is monster jam is NOT my jam. Years ago when we first started dating she had mentioned a desire to check it out. I mean, come on - who doesn’t have a little morbid curiosity when it comes to trucks that crush a bunch of cars? Well, years went by and we got married, but I never forgot about the supersize me truck show. When I started thinking about anniversary gifts, I wanted to be traditional but wrap in our sense of adventure and love for experiences. I figured the first anniversary gift is traditionally paper, so tickets would count. And, it just so happened that monster jam was happening right before I would start the trail. Bingo! That was my pony. In all seriousness though, we both had a good time. It’s something we will always remember doing together, with ear plugs....Today Gillian surprised me with a couples massage, which was amazing! His is where you’re probably thinking “yeah, that’s because she is smart and doesn’t try and drag you to some crazy event!” Fair enough :-). My back will definitely at least feel great at the start of the hike. Afterward, we went out for tacos at lunch and ran a few errands. Before we knew it, it was time for bed. I had some good quality time with Lucy the cat as well this weekend. I made sure  she got her favorite treats and we played with her favorite toy, Ribbon. Ribbon is sort of like a cross between a toy, a baby blanket, and permission to be a kitten again. We have so many cat toys, but Lucy only has love for Ribbon. Ribbon is actually a red ribbon from the box of a pen that I was gifted at my last job. One man’s trash is Lucy’s treasure....And now, as I type this, it’s time for bed and I’m going to wake up tomorrow and it will be THE DAY! I’ve waited so long for this that it feels surreal. I will miss my wife, family and friends so much, but this will be a grand adventure! I’m grateful for the love in my life and for the gift of so many smiles and laughs. To bed now I go, and tomorrow I’ll rise to walk north, one day at a time.",,View Entry,"Feb 25, Sun",0
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583385,"Read on! I promise the title to this post isn’t a typo. 
Today was a big day! I woke up early to get my gear together. Before I did that, however, I had two cups of coffee and spent a little quality time with Lucy the cat. My gear was mostly prepared; I just had to take care of a morning punch list, like: “wad up puffy jacket and stuff in clothes bag, grab charged power bank, don’t forget water,” etc. After I did that I thought about breakfast, but my mind drifted to these cupcakes Gillian had gotten the night before. They were seriously amazing and had a fair amount of icing, which I like. I changed focus and went to shower instead, and when I was done Gillian had made some avocado toast on pumpernickel bread. Pure deliciousness. Before that was ready, I weighed myself for comparison purposes at the end of the hike. 155lbs...not a lot to lose there.... 
The plan was that my parents would come to the house at 7:45am and we would drive together to Amicalola Falls State Park where the approach trail begins. It is possible to drive close to the summit of Springer Mountain where the Appalachian Trail actually starts, but it’s kind of traditional to walk the 8.8 mile approach trail, so that was my plan. My parents arrived as I started to eat breakfast, and Gillian made me some eggs as well. Did I mention my wife is amazing? The eggs were awesome and she included some micro greens too. We had just picked up our CSA farm share the day before, so everything was local, fresh and delicious. For those familiar with Atlanta, our farm share is from Ecosystem Farms on Bouldercrest Drive in East Atlanta, and we love it! I’m already talking so much about food and it’s only been one day! 
After breakfast we took some pictures. I had to document “clean and shiny me,” all freshly shaven and ready to get dirty. I took a picture of my backpack fully loaded, and then we headed out at about 8:30. Traffic was bad (this is normal) so google maps took us a kind of funky, roundabout way. I couldn’t help but think of how fitting it was, as I have heard many stories of AT switchbacks and PUDs (pointless ups and downs). As we got closer, my pea-sized bladder caused me to have to stop at a gas station. Inside a kid in hiking gear said hello. I couldn’t help but wonder if he was also thru hiking, but I did not ask. I jumped back in the car, and after 20 more minutes we arrived at the park. 
I had registered online as a thru hiker already, but I still had to check in and get my hiker number. I am number 371 for the year! We looked around the gift shop a bit. Gillian showed me a cool white blaze t-shirt and got it for me for after the hike. I registered with the rangers. They were amazing - so nice and helpful. I went outside where there is a hanging scale and weighed my pack. My base weight without food and water is 20lbs. My weight with food was 30lbs. Water (2 liters) added another 6. So I started with 36lbs, but of course the water and food weight fluctuates a lot. I was really happy with a 20lb base weight. One of the rangers gave me some local info and showed me the PCT method for hanging a bear bag. It seems bears are pretty clever and if you tie your bear bag rope off around a tree, they’ve learned to whack it down. The PCT method utilizes a carabiner and a stick to hang the bag vertically without needing to tie off the rope. Pretty cool. 
The time had come! Nothing left to do but start walking. Passing under the arch that marks the approach trail start felt amazing! My parents and Gillian walked with me up the approach trail. When we got a little ways up, I realized I’d already managed to leave my trekking poles back at the visitor center - ugh! This didn’t bode well :-). I went back and the rangers had picked them up, so I was relieved. They also gave me a snickers bar, which was nice. Dad had walked down to see if there was an issue, but I told him they had found the poles so I was all set, plus a snickers - sweet! So we backtracked to where Mom and Gillian were and continued along. We bypassed a footbridge that had been crushed by a fallen tree, and then the long climb up to Amicalola falls began. I said my goodbyes to my parents and Gillian joined me for a bit longer. After a bit of walking together, it was time to part ways. It was soooooo hard to leave her. I kept looking back and waiving as I walked away. When she was out of sight, it really kicked in that the challenge had begun. There are a lot of challenges on the trail, and often times the toughest ones are not the physical kind. 
I passed a few thru hikers on the way up. At the top of the falls I took a picture and waived to my family down below, and marched on. The trail crossed over the parking lot at the top of the falls, and then disappeared into the woods.
I knew I wanted to at least hike the 9 miles to the AT start at Springer Mountain summit. If I felt good and had enough daylight, I would continue another 4 miles or so to Three Forks. Three Forks is on the other side of Springer Mountain and is absolutely gorgeous. Three streams come together into one creek called Noontootla. I’ve been camping there for years via forest road access, so it has a special place in my heart. 
I trekked I’m in solitude for quite a while, until I passed a group of thru hikers. Two were from Maine, and one was from Atlanta about a mile or two from where I live. Small world. Later on I ran into a whole group of ladies roughly in their 60s coming the other way. They chatted with me a bit and said they liked my space cat hat, yay! I pushed on and felt good. The ridgeline view was gorgeous and there was a little blue sky peaking through the clouds. I decided not to take a lunch break, and instead just ate the snickers and a cliff bar on the move. Soon enough, I made it to the Springer Mountain summit! There is a plaque there that marks the start of the AT and the first white blaze. I took a picture of course. Apparently the shelter log book is by that rock. I didn’t realize that and forgot to look for it to sign it. Instead, I pushed on to the shelter to get some water and take a short break. I chatted with some guys there and met one gent from Alberta, Canada. I asked him how he found the weather and he said he was absolutely dying from the “heat!” I laughed. It was indeed a warm day for February, but welcome to the south! I bet he gets some warmer weather clothing options soon....
I pushed on from Springer and bumped into the couple from Maine again. The guy’s name was Kevin as well. The girl is Cassandra. They just got married and are hiking their honeymoon. They asked if I was going to Stover Shelter and I told them I wanted to try and make it to Three Forks. Push on I did. The forest started to change, thickening with pine and rhododendron as I descended in elevation.  I started to cross a few streams. One stream right after Stover Shelter had a beautiful campsite, but I pressed on. About 5pm I rolled into Three Forks. I crossed the wooden bridge there and the. The forest road FS58, and started looking for a campsite by the creek. I found an awesome spot off the trail, set up my tent and proceeded to get camp organized. My feet felt good with no blisters, so I let them breathe and took my socks off and just walked around in my camp crocs. Then it was time to hang the bear bag. I have to confess, I’m really, really bad at hanging bear bags. I always get the line tangled or stuck, and this time was no different! I found a nice stream rock to put in my bear bag toss sack. I found a good branch as well. But...when I threw my weighted sack over it, the line caught in some other branches and the weight of the rock in the sack wasn’t enough to pull it all the way down. Unfortunately, it was too high up to jump. I started looking around for long sticks to bat at it with to try and get it to come down. Nothing was long enough. Then I remembered my gorilla tape that I keep around my trekking pole shafts. I actually had to use that to duct tape my telling poles together into one long pole. Then I used that to grab the rock bag and pull it free and down. Voila! It worked! Maybe I have a little resourcefulness in me after all :-). Happy that I had avoided catastrophe, I boiled water to rehydrate some chili Mac. I descended like a locust on my snack bag. I ate a tortilla, a bunch of almonds, and a cliff bar. With the chili Mac I had a nice cup of turmeric ginger tea. 
It was a fabulous first day on the trail. As I type this I’m definitely ready for a good night’s sleep! Tomorrow I head to Gooch mountain. I’ll have to upload this entry later when I have a signal. All is well with the world. I’m grateful to be on this journey, living a dream! (Note, I did not include the 8.8 miles of the approach trail in my tally so that my total mileage will only show AT miles walked)","Amicalola Falls State Park - Approach Trail

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583433,"Today I woke to daylight at Three Forks. It was a brisk morning - someone said 36, but I think where I was it was probably closer to 40. I ate two packets of maple brown sugar oatmeal and a cliff bar, and had some instant coffee. It was delightful! I blundered around camp a bit, kicking stuff over and whatnot and spilling water, because that’s what I do. Enjoying every minute of it, I headed out at about 9:45. I made it about half a mile before I ate another cliff bar :-). The morning was absolutely gorgeous! Stunning sunlight through the rhododendron made me smile and feel wonderfully small. 
It was a blue sky day all day. I passed a handful of hikers, including a girl named Cat who I had seen yesterday. It’s hard for me to remember names, but hers was easy given my space cat hat. 
Machine gun fire littered part of the day. I passed a hiker who said it was from an M40 (Dad, maybe this means something to you, but to me it just means “big gun”). There is a military training area not too far away, hence the fire. Shortly, I passed a southbound guy who was doing some sort of military training. He was carrying a rucksack and what looked like an axe in one hand. He said hello but moved quickly on. The views from the trail were amazing! Lots of clear vistas with many peaks in the distance. 
I made it to Gooch Mountain shelter at about 3:30. Tom, a volunteer AT ambassador, greeted me and gave me a ton of super useful information. He said that rain and thunderstorms would move in around 2am and follow us all day tomorrow. That made my choice to stay st the shelter easy. We are going to be packed in like sardines! No one wants to tent in the rain. Hopefully it isn’t too hard to sleep.
No blisters yet! Met a girl with 4 today - ouch! Tomorrow wet feet will potentially break my streak. 
The couple from Maine are here! They are very cool. The guy Kevin has a trail name now - Bear Meat! He gave someone some bear jerky and that was it. His wife Cassandra saw me and said she had a trail name for me - Hungry Cat, after my hat! I loved it right away and told her I would embrace it. I thought about food all day, so it is not an I’ll-fitted name. I love the tradition of trail names. I came out here to have an experience, and maybe become a better version of me. I want to live up to the Hungry Cat name, whatever may come, whatever that means.... 
I ate a Knorr Mexican fiesta rice side for dinner and enjoyed chatting with other hikers. I met two guys from Mount Pleasant, SC and told them how much Gillian and I like to go there. As I type this, the sun had gone down so it is time to get organized for bed. A crowded house requires a bit of organization. No signal here so I will have to back post. I’m so grateful for this shelter and the camaraderie here tonight. Hungry Cat, out!","Three Forks
",Gooch Mountain Shelter,"Feb 27, Tue",11.40
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583469,"Let me first just say that snoring happens. People get congested, have sleep apnea - it happens and it’s ok. I’ve done it. I’ve driven my wife crazy when my nose was congested. Snoring - let’s just say it’s a thing.
Last night we all had fun chatting at Gooch Mountain Shelter. That said, everyone was constantly going back to their packs, removing things, re-organizing, and going back again for things they forgot. It was awesome! All of us a bunch of thru-hiking noobs having fun trying to get our systems and routines down. The shelter was jam packed, so all of our sleeping pads and bags were side by side on both levels of the shelter, AND we had a lady at the bottom sleeping perpendicular at our feet. As the cherry on top, one girl slept on top of the picnic table under the shelter. Like I said, it was awesome! I have never slept in a shelter before, always opting to tent on past trips. The idea of sleeping next to people while mice hop around and insects enjoy my flesh has kept me from doing it. So why were we all jammed in there you may wonder? Rain. It was set to rain all day on the 28th, starting about 3am. Breaking down tents in the rain gets everything wet, and then it stays wet in your pack, and if it does that long enough interesting science experiments begin to conduct themselves. So, we all jammed in so that getting out into the rain the next morning would be that much easier :-). 
Do you like symphonies? I know I do! However, last night the symphony played on and on and on through the night. Actually, it was a cacophony. A nasal, esophageal  cacophony that amazed and intrigued us listeners with its seemingly orchestrated melodies, rising and falling, sometimes synchronous and other times complimentary, pulling at the heart strings in that special kind of way where you just sort of want to die. Yep, I’m talking about snoring. Imagine it as an art form or an Olympic sport. These guys would have taken gold like candy from a baby. I mentioned there were two levels to the shelter. Up top, no snoring. Down below, four baritone bellowers with a fifth “little whistler” buried somewhere sporadically. I never did figure out if that was a separate person or just one person, composing a snore to put Mozart to shame. Anyway, I was sandwiched directly between two. These guys also had a fair bit of size on me. Keep in mind I’m 5’8” and 155lbs, so not taking up a big footprint at the shelter. I brought earplugs, and I put them in and then wore my buff over my ears. It was still deafening. I tried slyly elbowing the two next to me. Nothing! They just changed beats a little and kept right on going. And then the rolling started. One guy rolled over so he was sort of on my arm. I thrashed until he rolled back (still snoring). Then the other one started rolling on me too. Meanwhile, I’m laying straight as an arrow on my back Teton not to move and listening to it all unfold. I was really impressed. I told myself: “it is what it is, people snore. You snore sometimes. Not now, but you’ve done it. You’re no saint. When it’s your time to sleep, your higher power will let you drift into the darkness.” And I guess that’s what happened. Pretty sure I only got 2-3 hrs. That said, that’s trail life! Full of sights, sounds, and smells! Honestly, I was just so happy to be dry and with good people that I really didn’t care. Interspersed with the snores were the lovely back and forth cries of two owls. The moon was so bright it felt like the nightlight of the universe was on, casting it’s magical glow across the forest.
We got up around the same time, by necessity. It was early enough. We joked a little about the snores, and one of the guys named Jody who was in the shelter that night showed us his hat full of holes. The shelter mice decided it looked like good nesting material! Note to self - watch out for your space cat hat! The shelter there was very nice. It had a privy and bear boxes so I didn’t have to hang my food bag. 
Bear Meat and his wife Cassandra headed out while I prepped a breakfast of two packets of brown sugar oatmeal and some instant coffee. Shortly after that I headed out alone. I was targeting Blood Mountain as my destination, but Bear Meat made a persuasive comment in the morning: “if I’m going to get soaked all day, why not walk a few more miles and have a bunk and hot shower at the end.” This would become a no brained for me in about two hours, but at the time I just thought, “I’ll see how I feel.”
How I felt was DRENCHED! The rain picked up pace throughout the day. When I got to Woody Gap I didn’t even have clear visibility across the road there. Prior to that I hadn’t seen a soul except one day hiker. He was an older gentleman in a poncho and had a daily routine of walking from Woody Gap to Gooch Gap and back. Between the two gaps I did see a nice sized pile of bear scat in the middle of the trail. It was full of seeds. Fortunately it did not contain hiker bits.
At Woody Gap I entered the Blood Mountain wilderness. I have hiked this section before, but not in this kind of weather. Blood Mountain elevation is 4,457ft, so it can be very windy at the top. By the time I got to Woody Gap I was already pretty wet. Here’s the thing - I have rain pants and a rain jacket, but anything breathable can only take so much before water starts to find its way in. It still keeps some of you dry, but you do and will still get wet in all sorts of places. What the rain gear does though is adds a nice layer of insulation, especially on a day like today when it was chilly out and the wind was blowing. If I stood still, I was cold and wet, which is not good. That’s a recipe for hypothermia, which can actually occur at temperatures in the 50s - much higher than one might expect. But if I hiked at a brisk pace, with my one smart wool base layer and pants under the rain gear, I could actually keep my body at a comfortable hiking temperature, which is great because often rain gear makes one too hot, and therefore one might get drenched with sweat instead of rain. Anyway, I was wet but ok as long as I kept moving. So I did. I needed a little motivation as the ascent got steeper, so I sang some songs out loud. First it was “New York State Of Mind,” by Billy Joel. Then Ryan Bingham’s “Weary Kind,” a very fitting song for that day. Then “Clocks” by Coldplay. Then it was too steep and difficult to do anything but breathe. 
All the views off of Blood Mountain were completely whited out. I made it to the shelter where I expected to see some people from camp. No one. I left an entry in the shelter log book, then decided it was time to reward myself. At the summit it was cold, so I had to act fast. I took my “sharing size” (ha!) peanut m&ms and devoured them all in about 30 seconds. I dropped one in the mud. Yep, I picked it out and ate it anyway. Then I started the difficult descent towards Neel’s Gap. There is an outfitter and bunkhouse at Neel’s Gap called Mountain Crossings. I knew they had a bunk and a hot shower there for $20. Even before I got to Blood Mountain, this was a no brainer. That Bear Meat is smart! Better to stay at a bunkhouse on rainy day than a clear one when you want to be under the stars! 
The descent down the back of Blood Mountain was technical. First you have to pass over a few balds. The wind was nasty and almost blew off my pack cover (that wasn’t keeping my pack dry, but maybe “drier”). I tried to do a sort of short cadence hustle over the balds. Then the descent became more technical, with step-downs over multiple  boulders in the middle of flowing water. The trail had become a kind of shallow stream down the mountain. Now, I’m trying to practice good leave-no-trace principles. This means that you walk in the trail only, regardless of its condition. So I just walked through the river of water. It didn’t really matter anyway as my feet were soaked before I even got to Woody Gap. 
After a while, I passed a man with a dog. I felt bad for the dog. He was all wet and I wondered if his paws were cold. He looked hardy though so I’m guessing he was well used to that kind of thing, or suited for it by breed. The terrain started to improve and the rocks became sparser. I scampered a bit faster and started to hear cars. Eureka! I was close to Neel’s Gap. I ran across the road to their shop and got myself sorted with a bunk. It’s really a cool store - I highly recommend stopping by if you’re in the area. They are known on the trail for doing pack shakedowns. They look through your pack and tell you what you do/don’t need based on their experience. I may do that tomorrow, depending on when they open back up and on when I’m ready to leave. The little hostel there is lovely! Reminds me of hostels I’ve stayed at traveling. I took an AMAZING hot shower! I have to say that after only 3 days I had developed quite the hiker funk stench. Even after the shower I still had some smell.... but I felt great! Amazingly, I had no blisters. I sorted out my wet gear and tried to spread it around to dry. It won’t be dry by morning, but some of it might be close. It doesn’t really matter as I’m going to get soaked tomorrow too, but it’s kind of nice to at least start dryish. 
I went back to the store at Mountain Crossing and bought a frozen pizza. Red Baron. They cooked it for me. I bought 3 things of m&ms for my snack bag and a bag of Doritos. I ate the whole pizza and the Doritos. As I type this, I’m already hungry again, but I’m going to go to bed. 
I had fun chatting with the other hikers. Cassandra named another hiker Obiwan. She’s on a roll! I met a hiker named Stephanie from Indianapolis, and another guy called Preacher. Later in the evening a German guy named Mateus arrived - I haven’t chatted with him yet, but might tomorrow. He hiked roughly 20 miles today!
Tomorrow the plan is to get up and hike 11.5 miles to Low Gap Shelter. I think that shelter is small, so it will probably be crowded. For that reason, I am not sure if I’ll hang out to do a pack shakedown. I’m actually really happy with my gear and clothing choices so far. There is nothing that I brought that I’m not purposing. On that note, I wanted to briefly make three gear points:

Someone asked me what my favorite piece of gear is. For versatility, right now definitely my buff. Keeps me warm but isn’t as heavy as a wool beanie. It fits under my hat. I’ve used it as an oven mitt for my cook pot. I can wipe my face with it. However, while that is my favorite, a less sexy contender is simply my trekking poles. I don’t know how people backpack the AT without them. I can use them to strategically alleviate pressure on my knees and hips. They keep me from falling in the mud. I already taped them together to get my bear bag down. They are an amazing tool!
Rain pants- a lot of people say don’t bother bringing rain pants. It is true that this piece of gear is often sent home. I say, bring the rain pants, or at least bring them if you’re starting when it is still cold like I have. I would have been very uncomfortable today (and tomorrow!) without them. 
Boots vs trail runners: jury is still out for me. I think I will end up switching to trail runners, but something with a thick sole more like a boot. There is no such thing as a waterproof boot so I won’t even bother with goretex and that stuff. Today’s weather will soak everything. That said, pack weight makes a difference in what you feel through your feet. I can’t imagine hauling my 35lb fully loaded with water pack with very soft trail runner soles. If you’re thinking about this, try the shoes with a pack in a a store like REI, and walk outside and step on some rocks. How does that feel? If it doesn’t feel great, go with a better soul and get whatever will dry out the quickest. That is my plan for when I retread.

On a final note, I looked down today and my legs were covered in bubbles and suds most of the day. I must not have rinsed all of the detergent out of my rain pants when I last washed them! It was the funniest thing. I didn’t get a picture because it was so wet out, but I’m so glad I already have a trail name or I might have ended up getting called “Suds!” 
I’m grateful that I was able to experience the weather today and gain some knowledge there. I look forward to the lessons tomorrow will bring. The weekend is supposed to be nice! Looks like Saturday will be a resupply day in Hiawassee, then back on the trail on Sunday. 
Thank you all for the great guest book entries!! I caught up on those tonight. Your support means a lot to me! This Hungry Cat is grateful.","Gooch Mountain Shelter
",Neel’s Gap,"Feb 28, Wed",15.40
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583514,"I slept like a baby last night. The bunk at Neel’s Gap was quite comfortable, and there was no snoring! We were all up early: Bear Meat, Cassandra, Stephanie, Preacher and his son, a kid I’ve been calling Skids, and a few other folks. Cassandra struck again with the trail naming! There was an older gentleman at the hostel who she named Obiwan. Apparently he gave them a lot of good backpacking advice, and he’s also an OBGYN. Get it? Cassandra is good at this! I hope to name someone at this point, if the trail has that in the cards for me. 
The outfitter store didn’t open until 8:30, so we were all blatantly hanging around for one thing - hot food! As soon as they opened I bought two Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches and a coffee. Based on my hiking plan, I didn’t need to resupply after all, which was nice. I did buy three packs of M&Ms though. Gotta have those little rewards for the tough weather and long miles! 
I inhaled the sandwiches and they were amazing! The coffee was bad and excellent. What I mean is, it was like bad diner coffee but at the exact moment when that is precisely what you want, like when you’re in college trying to stay up to study. Energized, I decided to hit the trail. I didn’t want to start with the larger group. I tend to be a bit faster so I would pass some of them, and the rain had momentarily turned to mist, so I wanted some alone time with the trail to appreciate it and start my morning. I headed off through the archway at Neel’s Gap that the trail runs under. The forecast called for rain all day, so we were all in our rain gear. I didn’t make it half a mile up the ascent before stopping to take my jacket off. After that I got in almost a good hour of hiking before the rain came. It was a gorgeous, foggy morning. Rain dripped from the trees and mountain laurel. I kept hoping to spot a bear, thinking I might have a better chance of seeing one with lower visibility. A few squirrels puttered about, and I enjoyed the cheery sounds of small birds flitting about. They didn’t mind the rain so why should I? I didn’t really. I knew it was coming. And it did. The hiking wasn’t as hard as yesterday, BUT originally I had planned to hike to Low Gap Shelter, about 9 miles away. The weather is supposed to be beautiful and clear the next few days, so I thought a shorter hike to the shelter would be good and I could wait out the rest of it, let gear dry, and socialize. However, I knew a lot of people had that plan, so I knew there was a chance the shelter would be full. It was! Well, it wasn’t really. The people inside had just spread out. They said there was room for one more, but really there was capacity for free. They were also smoking pot inside the shelter, so I decided to move on. I filtered water there, slammed down a pack of m&ms, and kept moving. I was wet in many places by that time, so I needed to keep moving so I wouldn’t get cold. I had to belt out quite a few more miles so I hustled on. 
As I crossed Tesnattee Gap, the heavens opened up a bit more. That was the heaviest rain of the day. On the other side of the mountain (I forget the name of that gap), I crossed a road and there was a guy biking. It was only misting there. I told him it was pouring on the other side. When I left he was contemplating whether to keep riding or turn around. 
Thereafter, I was gifted beautiful views of stunning waterfall streams cascading down here and there along the mountainside. It was like the veins of the earth had opened up for my viewing. I guess that sounds kind of gross, but you get my point. I wish I had a picture, but it was raining hard enough for me to not want to pull out my camera.
As I got closer to blue mountain, I thought I had arrived at the water source right before the shelter. I didn’t want to have to walk back in the rain to get water, so I filled my bag. Then I kept walking and realized I wasn’t at the water source by the shelter, so I dumped the bag and hiked on. I soon came upon it, refilled, and joined the folks already at the shelter. There was a man and his son, and two other guys, one of whom looked slightly hypothermic. He was shaking and trying to warm up. I stripped off my wet clothes and asked him if he wanted tea, but he said he was going to make soup. We found creative ways to try and hang wet clothing and fasten it down. As the storm blows through tonight there will be 40mph winds, so hopefully we don’t wake up to everything blown away! Luckily the wind is hitting the back of the shelter. I cooked up some dinner and took some vitamin i (ibuprofen, as it is known on the trail). We hung our bear bags and chatted for a bit. A guy named Swagman showed up, as well as a German guy I had met the night before named Mateus (spelling?). 
I’m so grateful I got a spot at this shelter as it would have been hard to tent with the wind. I’m also grateful that I had the strength to be ok with going so far today, and for the beautiful views the trail allowed me to see today. 
A few postscript notes: I didn’t do a pack shakedown at the Neel’s  Gap outfitter. I am using everything I brought and don’t feel like I would want to get rid of anything, and I also didn’t want to get a late start. In hindsight I’m really glad I did skip it!
I passed by a couple today whose names were Which Way and Next Step. They have a trail journal but I have not read it. Aside from the pictures you see in my journal entries, I’m posting others in the photo section if you’re interested.
Tomorrow I aim for deep hole gap, or something like that. I think it’s about 16 miles. Then I can resupply in hiawassee Saturday and decide if I duck back out to the trail or stay the night there. I stink so badly!! A shower might be good.
Time for lights out. Going to get down to about 32 tonight so sleeping with my water filter inside my sleeping bag. Will be a cold and beautiful morning - hoping to see what the clouds were hiding! Oh man.....some snoring just started. Trail life!
Thank you for all of the great guest book posts! I wish they were easy to respond to, but just know that I read them and appreciate them all very much. Hungry cat, out!","Neel’s Gap
",Blue Mountain Shelter,"Mar 01, Thu",18.80
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583544,"When I woke, the rain was gone but the winds were howling and cold. I saw the most beautiful sunrise from my sleeping bag. The photo doesn’t do it justice. I was too cold to get out of the bag to take it! Finally I did have to get out. Matthias ( Mateus? Not sure) left as fast as possible. He wanted to get to the next gap to get out of the cold and wind before eating. Also, he’s a German ultra marathoner, so compared with the Alps I’m pretty sure he was peachy running down Blue Mountain. I opted for hot breakfast - two oatmeal packets and a cup of coffee. After eating, I felt better. Energized tike a Hungry Cat should be, I took off down the trail leaving Vermont the Penny Pincher and Storage Unit behind. Apparently Vermont has a YouTube channel of sorts. Storage Unit was not prepared for the cold. I fear his sleeping bag isn’t warm enough as he was almost hyperthermic last night, and slow to rise this morning. 
No rain!!!! YES! That and the wind and the cold almost had me running down the trail. I hiked in my normal layers, but with rain gear for warmth. My socks didn’t dry out overnight - they just froze. But since my boots were still wet I wore the wet socks too. I needed dry ones for camp (which I’m wearing happily now!). Hike jogging helped warm up my feet. I noticed after about a quarter mile that my left ankle and right knee weren’t loving the downhills. Fortunately I knew I had a nero (near zero miles) day coming on Saturday.  I also need new inserts for my boots. But it was also a good reality check. So far I’d had no real issues or pain, such that my ego was creeping in a little saying “you got this,” and whispering sweet nothings in my ear like “push a few more miles.” My wife knows how self competitive I am. Well, competitive in general. I like to pass people, not be passed! Well, today I took that garbage and threw it where it belongs - off of Blue Mountain! Ego will just get me injured out here. I want my experience to be driven by passion and enjoyment! So I slowed down to a comfortable pace and promised myself I would stop at Deep Gap no matter what, then nero in Hiawassee on Saturday. I’m really glad I let it go and settled in. If you see my ego peaking out from around a corner, whack a mole it for me won’t you?
It was a gorgeous day of hiking. Some long inclines and blustery ridge lines. Going into Unicoi Gap, I met the owner of Budget Inn in Hiawassee. He was waiting with a shuttle for hikers. Really nice guy. I should see him tomorrow. Kind of a funny cat, he told me he also does wrestling and dresses up in tights and a mask going as Snake, a Mexican wrestler. He said he speaks Spanish, but then just said a bunch of stuff to me in a Cheech and Chong voice. It was odd, but he seemed really into it, and I think he did that for me since I don’t speak Spanish. Anyway, i will try and learn more about his story tomorrow. I know he was a past thru hiker.
Ascending from Unicoi Gap I passed Candyman and his girlfriend Fifty. They helped take a picture of me, which was nice. I passed a few other hikers on the way up. I realized today that I love the climbs. I’ll take an uphill over  steep downhill any day! It’s easier on my legs and knees, and I have the lungs for it from running. On the downhills I look like I’m using a walker with my trekking poles, cautiously feeling around for placement, sometimes flailing.
Ascending Tray Mountain was a long climb. I was rewarded with beautiful vistas at the top. Later in the day as I got close to the shelter, I met a kid named Noah who was headed that way as well. He’d stayed at a hostel there the night before and left his maps there. Said he had to grab them at Dicks Creek Gap in the morning. Later that evening I would learn that he was only 18 and decided to do the trail after high school. 
Kelly’s Knob was the last big climb before the shelter. It was quite the treat! Straight up and long, but of course there were scenic views to be had. On the path to the shelter I grabbed two liters of water to filter. Fortunately there were spots in the shelter. I toyed with the idea of pushing a few more miles to make tomorrow easier, but decided it was a bad move. I would have to find a place to pitch my tent, and I wasn’t sure about the wind situation. A shelter was the smart choice, and my legs were beat. Two lively sisters were at the shelter - Bernadette and Margaret. Bernadette is a judge from Portland, and Margaret lives in McCayesville, GA near Blue Ridge. I called them trail moms because they took Noah in, trying to fatten him up. He’s not carrying a stove or cooking at all, so he largely eats granola bars, peanut butter, and pop tarts. 
I unpacked my stuff and got settled in, right as one of the guys said that there were two mouse nests upstairs. I went to look. More like mouse condos!!!! Oh man, I hope nothing chews at my sleeping bag tonight.... 
I was starving, so I ate chili mac for two, two tuna packets, a tortilla and a cliff bar. I also ate a pack of m&ms - my last one for now. I chatted with Noah and the trail moms, then set about getting settled down. Sleeping with water filter and bottles at the bottom of my bag tonight so they won’t freeze....
I forgot to mention that last night I met Cole and Jim at Blue Mountain Shelter. Cole just graduated high school and is going to New York University in the fall for theater. His dad Jim was section hiking with him. He was hiking to Maine but skipping the Shenandoahs as he had hiked that section earlier this year. After I typed this I saw that Cole’s mom put an entry in my guest book! Too funny. Hey Cole’s mom, you’ve got a great kid there! Tell him to go easy on the chili though. I suggested a trail name for him as a joke that he can tell you about. Maybe a better one would be Gazelle. I heard an older gent call him that today and I never caught up with him. Sad to say I will probably not see him again unless he slows down!
Yesterday morning I also hiked with a guy named Steve-O from PA. He was gregarious and grateful to be on the trail as well. He asked what I did for work, whether I left, how old I was, etc. When he found out I left a career at 40, he said “wow, and you’re in your money-making years.” He said he was impressed and respected the choice. There are no guarantees in life. It got me thinking though, THAT is exactly why I needed a change. My 40s, or any other period of my life, should never be solely dedicated to making money. We all gotta pay the bills, but I never want to fear having adventures because I feel like I have to be on a hamster wheel with no exit, or part of some system that values income over experiences. Steve-O, thanks for giving me the opportunity to think about that! Also, his trail name was funny. He said his name was Steve and he just wanted to sound younger.
Tomorrow will be an early start to hike 4.6 miles to Dicks Creek Gap to get a shuttle into town. I need to resupply, clean my clothes and me, get some shoe insoles, and do a couple of field repairs and mods. I forgot a sewing  needle so I’m going to ask at the hotel or an outfitter tomorrow.
Today was incredible. I’m grateful that I was humbled with some pain, but nothing horrible. I met so many people today, including many I can’t remember and Ben and Rose from the finger lakes in central New York. I appreciated all of the conversation and banter. Thank you all so much for the guest book notes and comments. Lots of friends and coleagues have posted support, and it helps keep me going every day. We are in this together!!!! 
 As I passed through the Swag of Blue Ridge today, I couldn’t help but feel like a king. A real king, full of the wealth that is life.

#1. If you are interested in checking the weather on the AT, or interested in checking up on my wuss factor based on any of the comments I make about the trail weather where I’m hiking or staying, use this site: Atweather.org. It is absolutely amazing and I am trying to use it myself on the trail where I have a signal. Weather does change fast out here though!
#2.  Someone from Ohio asked about cameras in the guest book. I use my phone. Unless you plan to do some kind of specialized video, or expect to be the next Ansel Adams, I recommend just using a phone if you have one that will take decent pictures. I have an iPhone and keep it in a Lifeproof case. Hungry Cat has to lifeproof his stuff off the trail too. Hungry Cat sees snack, runs to snack, drops phone.... You’ll thank yourself for not having the weight of an extra camera, and you really won’t want something hanging around your neck. You have to think about rain too - with a phone in a life proof case you can still take some pictures when it is wet, though I minimize mine for equipment safety, and also because it’s wet and I might feel less like taking a picture. That all said, Confucius said, “you do you.” You have to hike your own hike and carry your own stuff. If you really want a point and shoot camera, maybe try to get something as small and lightweight as possible that you can put in your pocket. I’m sure The Google can help you with that search. Check out Darwin on the Trail’s videos on YouTube - he brings a camera for filming and is a lightweight hiker. I really hope you make it on the AT and share some of those pictures with us!
#3 I got a science/physics lesson yesterday. I couldn’t figure out why my homemade gravity water filter system wasn’t working well (see gear videos for what this is). Well, this genius created a perfect deal between the filter and the bottle that the clean water runs to. So, as pressure builds the water stops flowing. The system still works, but the key is to screw the smart water bottle in all the way, then loosen it a tad to create an air gap. Voila! Sir Isaac Newton be not baffled! If you do this it will flow properly. I thought my filter was badly clogged. The good news is it is not! The bad news is, I would fail sixth grade science....","Blue Mountain Shelter
",Deep Gap Shelter,"Mar 02, Fri",15.50
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583586,"Sometimes it takes a nero (near zero mile day) and some town travel to help reveal the magic of the trail. That certainly proved to be the case today. The trail is a funny thing. It kind of forces you to let go. Plans constantly require adjustment, so it’s best just to try to be prepared to be safe and let the details work themselves out. I woke up at about 5:30am at Deep Gap Shelter. Right before I fell asleep I heard the guys in the loft above me banging around at a mouse. My fear in shelters is always that a mouse will chew through my sleeping bag, which is down, and ruin its insulating abilities. Fortunately that did not happen. Hopefully those in the loft above me faired ok.
It was a cold 30 degrees in the gap, but the wind had died down so it felt much warmer than the prior morning on Blue Mountain. I snoozed a bit, not wanting to brave the cold outside of my sleeping bag. I knew I needed to get cracking though, as the shuttle run by the Budget Inn where I wanted to stay was supposed to be at Dick’s Creek Gap around 9am. But......a Hungry Cat’s gotta eat! I decided to multitask and started boiling water while repacking my gear. I basically have two sets of clothes - one to hike in and one to sleep in. I hike in pants and sleep in tights. On cold nights I shove my fleece in the bottom of the toe box of my sleeping bag. It keeps my feet warmer and also keeps the fleece warmer for the morning. Some people use down booties, but I find the fleece to be a great multi-purpose alternative. I can nestle my feet in it or just rest them on it. The latter is what I usually do. Anyway, while my water worked up a boil, I did the painfully cold dance of stripping off my pants and then tights outside the shelter, then putting just my pants back on. I like to wear both until right before I get moving to help keep warm. I also stripped off my puffy jacket and packed that. I never hike with it. I deliberately did not filter water. I had a liter and that would be plenty to get me to the gap. My right knee was bugging me so I wanted to minimize weight and extra water would be counterproductive. 
My water ready, I poured a cup of coffee and two packs of instant oatmeal. I use a homemade pot cozy to keep my water warm. That way I can pour it into one oatmeal packet, eat that, and then it stays hot for the second packet (or second cup of coffee). 
It was time to hit the trail. Unfortunately, I couldn’t take a lazy pace if I wanted to make the 9:15am shuttle and not wait for the 11am shuttle. So, I tried to keep up a decent pace. The trail felt like permafrost, frozen overnight like  a hardened clay. I took some photos of the beautiful views, but scampered to the top of Powell Mountain. I had a signal on the mountain so I phoned the Budget Inn to let them know I was coming. 
I hiked on in solitude. As I descended into Moreland Gap, I met a day hiker who asked me how bad the climb was. He was headed south. I told him I didn’t know since I was headed north, but that I hoped it wasn’t as bad as the downhill. He probably thought that was weird, but I’m an uphill man in a downhill world - the struggle is real (for my knees)!
Shortly after that I heard the road and made it to Dick’s Creek Gap at 8:53am. I had left camp at 7:15am, so not a bad clip for gimpy cat. 
I had called the inn from the mountaintop because the gap is known for not having a cell phone signal. Surprisingly, I was able to get a fleeting signal anyway, and got a few texts off to my wife and a friend, before the ephemerality that so frequently plagues AT&T in the mountains manifested itself in the little red exclamation marks beside my text messages. Oh well - I would touch base once in town.
I sat down, looked at my AT guidebook, and then started charging my phone in my pocket. A hiker came nearby looking at the sign to the gap, and suddenly I hear: “Hungry Cat?” I looked up expecting to see someone from the shelter, or maybe from the day before, but I did not recognize the woman standing in front of me. Now, my wife will tell you this is not unusual and that I have face blindness, but that’s debatable (according to me), and it’s a story for another day (and maybe for someone who looks like you but isn’t actually you). I must have looked puzzled (an expression I have perfected so that it is almost just my face - resting puzzled face) because she then introduced herself as Louise, explained that we hadn’t met, but that she was reading my trail journal and recognized me (the hat stands out I guess). She then said that she didn’t mean to seem like a stalker, but happened to be out hiking for the day and spotted me by chance. I found that comment hilarious. I’m not afraid of stalkers anyway - my BO is so bad at this point, I have natural defenses! But in all seriousness, I was delighted and surprised that someone would recognize me, so I asked her if we could take a picture together and if I could post it. So, for today’s cover photo shoot, meet Louise! Louise, it was awesome meeting you and I wish you the best of luck on your hike! If you hike long enough, you will become a stalker of food! Now maybe Louise will write a journal, and another hiker will read that journal and find Louise, and then another hiker will read that hiker’s journal and find that hiker, and then I’ll end up working with that hiker who is actually Louise’s cousin who falls in love with the other hikers who I never met but then meet later. It would be an AT version of the movie Crash. I digress....
After Louise left I waited around the parking lot and noticed a guy sleeping in a minivan with the engine on. I continued waiting. 9:15 went by, no shuttle. Then, I see a hiker named Zane come across the road. We chatted for a bit. He needed to go into town to try and have his phone fixed. It had gotten wet the day before and stopped working. As we were chatting, the van guy woke up and came outside. He asked us if we had seen anyone else coming down the mountain. Neither of us had. He was waiting for his brother and he was late. His brother is starting a thru hike on April 15 and was out testing gear. I believe Van Guy’s name was Jason. He said he couldn’t wait on his brother much longer as he had to get to Atlanta, but that he would give us a ride into town. I told him I was going to the Budget Inn, at which point he told me that it had a bad reputation and that a lot of folks hang out there and do drugs. That definitely had me concerned as I had not heard this at all. I thanked him for the warning, figuring I would check it out and if it seemed too dodgy just walk down the road to the next place. As we were talking, a van pulled up and a couple of hikers jumped out. The driver Tim was a gregarious guy. I thought he was a shuttle at first, but turns out he was just a nice guy giving people rides to help them out. I guess you could say he was a situational trail angel. Anyway, Tim gave Zane and I a ride into town for free, which was awesome (big thanks Tim!!!) Tim knew the area well and had hiked a lot of the trail. In the south he’s what we call “good people.”
When we got to the Budget Inn, there were hikers in the parking lot and it looked fine! I went in and booked a room, which was ready shortly. My goal for this trip was to clean up, eat up, supply up, and rest up. The hot shower felt incredible! It was really something else. I got some quarters from the front desk for their onsite laundry. There was a hiker box in the lobby full of free items other hikers didn’t want. I grabbed a bag of Idahoan mashed potatoes - score!
I made a shopping list for resupply and walked a quarter mile down the road. I stopped at a few outdoor stores along the way to look for good insoles, but no one had any. As for food, the Huddle House was my pony, so I went there for brunch at about 11am. I had an amazing experience there, but I need to get to bed so I will tell that story of magic tomorrow.
After said magical event, I went to the local Ingles to resupply. I think my food bag will be even heavier than when I started!!! Ugh. I wish I weren’t so hungry all the time! I shouldn’t have hiker hunger yet. I told my wife that and she said “you had hiker hunger before you left.” It’s true.... I went back to the hotel to do laundry and ran into Bear Meat and Cassandra! I love seeing those guys. We chatted and caught up on our trail tales since our divergence a few days prior. I told Cassandra that for whatever reason, because she is an E.R. Nurse, in my head I would always call her “Clooney.” I had seen commercials recently for reruns of ER where George Clooney was really young, so it kind of stuck in my head. Also, the alliteration if Clooney and Cassandra helped me remember her name. She seemed to warm up to the nickname. We’ll see if it becomes her trail name! They were in the “honeymoon suite” and it had its own jacuzzi.... We joked about how maybe that was a “look but don’t use” jacuzzi. There’s just something about hot swirling water in a tub beautifully crafted with holes that recirculate said water. It’s like a Panama City Beach spring break for the bacteria family. They get everywhere.
In the laundry room, someone had left free detergent. More magic! I put in a wash and walked to the rite aid down the street to get some shoe inserts. Doctor Sholls would have to do. I chatted with Bear Meat and another gent whose name I can’t recall. I had seen him in a gas station on my way to the approach trail and told him I recognized him. Small world.... There was a nice patch of green in front of the laundry, so I foraged a bit while we talked and ate some dandelion leaves for vitamin c. I’m used to getting a lot more veggies in my diet. He told me that in a month or two we might find ramps on the trail. That would be amazing. 
I finished up laundry, cleaned and organized gear and food, then went to Barney’s Tap Room next door for dinner. I had Barney’s Famous Ruben and potato salad, and a slice of chocolate pie. It was all incredible, and I met Barney as well! I actually had to go back to the restaurant about 45 minutes later when I realized I left my jacket there. They were very sweet about it and the lady there (I think Barney’s wife) said she grew up in Brookhaven when I told her I was from Atlanta.
Tomorrow I will talk about my Huddle House brunch. Hungry Cat needs some sleep! I’m so glad I took today to resuooly ir none of these great things would have happened. I’m grateful for the beautiful weather today, the kindness of strangers, and that the dirty dandelion leaves I ate didn’t upset my stomach. Hungry Cat, out!Postscript: My Father-in-Law asked if I brought a leather man knife on the trail. Ron, nope! I brought the tiniest Swiss Army knife ever and it is my new best friend! It’s the best ultralight backpacking knife I’ve seen, and it does everything I need for field repairs/tasks for 18 bucks! Comes super sharp too. I posted a picture of it in my photo gallery.","
",Dick’s Creek Gap (Hiawassee),"Mar 03, Sat",3.60
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583608,"I ate a bag of Idahoan buttery mashed potatoes with TVP (textured vegetable protein, like dehydrated soy crumbles), two packs of maple brown sugar oatmeal, a few almonds, and a granola bar for dinner. I can’t even add as high as that many calories is. I was still a little hungry but knew I didn’t need to eat more. Before I get to today though, let me finish my Hiawassee story from yesterday. 
I went to the Huddle House in Hiawassee to get my breakfast on. I was craving a good solid breakfast, and in general it is one of my favorite meals of the day, along with lunch, dinner, and snack times. I sat at the diner counter and the friendly staff had a water and coffee in front of me before I could blink. I added a little cream to my coffee. Why not? As I pondered my choices, a little old lady came in and pulled up a seat next to me. She asked me what I was ordering and I told here I was trying to decide. She ordered, and then I ordered eggs, turkey sausage, and two blueberry pancakes. We got to talking and she was just the nicest lady. I am 99% sure her name was Miss Ellie. I wish I had written it down right away. She gave me her bacon because she couldn’t eat it. She said she had a lot of teeth issues, and I noticed she was just eating grits and eggs. She said she lived in Young Harris, about 15 minutes away. She told me she runs a halfway house for girls. She said it was small and could hold 5 women, but that she also let one stay at her house. All the while Miss Ellie was chatting with the staff at Huddle House. They all new her well. She asked about the trail and my wife, and we talked through the meal. I asked if I could take a picture with her, to remember our lovely conversation on my journey north. She smiled and said “I’ll just go out in my teeth.” She came back and we took the photo you see today. I thanked her for the conversation, went to the bathroom, and when I came back to pay my bill she was gone. The waitress informed me that she had paid mine as well! I ran outside the restaurant, but she was no where in sight. It was such a kind and sweet thing to do. Real trail magic! The AT itself is of course beautiful, but some of the best experiences happen with the people we meet going to and from the trail. Miss Ellie was definitely an angel of the trail.
I woke up this morning ready to hit the trail. Before I even got out of bed, I ate an orange on my belly like an otter, and then a banana. I felt better, had new insoles, a humongous bag of food, and just enough time to grab a sandwich from Subway before the shuttle came. It was nice to shower in the morning and put on clean clothes!
The shuttle dropped me off at Dick’s Creek Gap and it was time to go. The weather was brisk, but not windy. Today was going to be a day of ascension, and I was happy with that. Downhills hurt my knees, but the uphills are fine. I climbed out of Hiawassee summiting Buzzard Knob. I kept a very slow, steady pace. At about 11:30, I stopped for lunch and kicked my boots and socks off to air my feet. I ate a tortilla with sriracha flavored tuna and a cliff bar. I changed out my sock liners as part of my foot care routine, and who came around the bend but Cole! I had met him and his Dad Jim at blue mountain. Cole is hiking with a friend for two weeks. We chatted briefly. Cole was wearing a hiking skirt over his tights, which I thought was cool. I haven’t tried one but they are supposed to be really multifunctional. I topped lunch off with a little vitamin i (ibuprofen) and hit the trail again. The rest of the day was almost steady climbing. I had planned to hike 9 miles and camp at Bly Gap. I knew I was there when I passed the famous GA/NC border sign. I stopped to take a picture - I had finished my first state! It felt amazing, but also a little sad to leave “home.”  There is a photo of the sign in the journal photos. 
I passed on camping at bly Gap as it seemed a little windy on the ridge line there. I decided to push 2 more miles and climb the towering courthouse bald at 4,708 feet. It was quite the vertical hustle! The views from the top of courthouse bald were stunning! I posted a picture in my photos. That made an elevation gain for the day of 2,133 feet, and I had crossed the highest point I’ve been on the trail yet. Tomorrow I will climb standing Indian mountain at over 5400 feet!
I stealth camped near the muskrat creek shelter, right beside muskrat creek. I set about my camp chores and made the whopping dinner I described earlier. I had pulled the mashed potatoes from the hiker box at the Budget Inn in Hiawassee. I can hear the soft babble of the creek as I lay here typing this. I had some good conversations with other hikers today. I’m grateful for their camaraderie, and so grateful that my legs were ok today. The trail helped me today with the uphills, which was amazing. Now it is time for sleep.... the stars are burning bright in the sky....
Postscript: 
#1 - I was told I misspelled hypothermia and typed “hyperthermia.” I meant hypothermia, but I’m too tired to actually go find and correct it :-).
#2 - I never did learn more about Ron Haven, owner of the Budget Inn, aka “Snake.” I never saw him after the day at Unicoi Gap, even at his motel.","Dick’s Creek Gap (Hiawassee)
",Muskrat Creek Shelter ,"Mar 04, Sun",11.80
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583721,"Today was amazing day of hiking, eating, chatting, and photo taking (I won’t call my photos photography). But first, I remembered a few details about last night that I want to jot down. I confessed to how much food I ate at dinner last night, but I left out one detail that I’m now ready to come clean on.... When I made the mashed potatoes in my pot, there was a lot of potato residue in the pot when I was done. I didn’t have the energy to wash it twice though, so I just poured my oatmeal in with the potatoes and went to town on it. I also didn’t heat water for the oatmeal; I just poured a little cool water on it, stirred it up with the potato bits, and shoveled it home! There, I said it.
I also remembered how bright the moonlight was last night. I woke up to nature’s call and thought it was already morning. I checked the time and it was 1am. The moon was just laying in the sky, sparkling like a diamond. I didn’t even need a headlamp. Later that morning I went up the hill by the shelter to use the privy and ran into Vermont the Penny Pincher who was at the Blue Mountain Shelter with me a few notes ago. He said he hiked in the dark to get to the shelter the night before. I’m sure the moonlight made that easier! 
The moon didn’t make this morning any warmer though. It was freezing when we woke up. The condensation under the gas canister for my stove froze to the canister, clinging to it like freezer burn. It was a beautiful morning though, and I moved lazily about camp since I had gone a few extra miles the day before. I savored my coffee and used it to help thaw out my numb fingers. Coffee finished, I began to organize my gear back into my pack, when Bear Meet and Cassandra (Clooney?) spotted me from the trail. They stopped to chat. They had stopped at Bly Gap, where I had originally planned to stop. One of my concerns there was the wind, but they said they didn’t have any problems and had the entire place to themselves. Pretty cool....
I got my stuff packed up and headed out around 8:30am. I peaked around the corner as I headed out of camp to see if a family I met yesterday was still there, but they were gone. Amy and her two sons Alec and Coby are section hiking. They are from Michigan and seem very active - what a cool thing to do with your kids! The two boys looked to be in their late teens, but I couldn’t tell how old. I was impressed by how quietly and efficiently they had gotten out of camp. 
I expected a day of brutal climbs with Standing Indian Mountain on the docket, the highest peak of the trail so far. Nothing could have been farther from the truth! The climbs today were all fairly gradual, and the downhills not too bad, so my knees were feeling good. I passed Cole and his friend. Later on I ran into Steve-O and took a picture with him (in my photos). I was looking for a lunch spot, and right after I saw him I found a great rock with a gorgeous view. I wasn’t quite at the summit yet, but it was a perfect spot for lunch. When I sleep in my tent, the footprint and rainfly are always wet the next day. I usually stuff them in the outer mesh pocket of my bag so they might dry a bit, and also spread them out to dry while I eat lunch. I spread them on the rock, kicked off my boots and socks, And set to making a delicious gourmet lunch of tuna packed in extra virgin olive oil with sun dried tomatoes in a tortilla. YUM!! I ate a granola bar as well. I still had two packs of peanut M&Ms and a snickers bar that I purchased at the Ingles in Hiawassee. I was very proud of myself for not touching those yesterday and saving them, so I decided to reward myself with the snickers. As I went to open it, I noticed it was one of those snickers wrappers that has a funny word on it. Mine said “klutz.” How appropriate, and such a harbinger of my evening to come. Holy amazing mouth explosions Batman!!! That snickers tasted like manna from heaven. It was divine, and I figured I had a good quarter mile of hiking while enjoying all the bits and bobs that were stuck in my teeth. The trail is good for dentists, but not for teeth (I’ve flossed a few times sweetie, I promise, but my fingers are gross and I don’t want them in my mouth!).
I reeled a little from the sugar buzz, but changed out my sock liners to crisp, dry ones, popped my boots back on, collected my tent gear (which had mostly dried), and pushed on. Before I did, I took the rocks I had used to hold my tent materials in place (it was a little breezy) and carefully put them back where I had found them. I do try and practice leave no trace, and I’m getting better at remembering it as I spend more time on the trail. 
I was close to the summit of standing Indian Mountain and the views were spectacular. It was an amazingly forgiving climb up for a reward that good! After I passed the summit the trail worked its way along the ridge line. Ever since I had entered the southern Nantahala forest earlier that morning, the signs of the forest fires from last fall (or was it the prior fall...?) were prevalent. It made me so grateful for the amount of rain we have had this year. I’ll now run off on a small tangent, so please bear (chuckle chuckle) with me. I heard a kid talking the other day about how he had a friend who lived up near the white mountains and came down to hike with him, but left after a few days because the mountains here weren’t as high as the whites and he was just hiking through a bunch of dead trees. Now, I’m paraphrasing, but that was the gist of it. And hey, that’s a perfectly valid opinion, so I’m not going to knock it. What I will say is, I am glad I have the ability to see and appreciate the beauty in death. Autumn would not be colorful without death. And there is such hope in the forest, for what else rebuilds itself in its entirety year after year after year at such a grand scale? Even the charred remains of the trees were impressive. Many of those trees had died to make fertile soil for a new generation of flora to come. Anyway, the signs of forest fire made me remember that comment that I heard, which made me happy that I can see the beauty in death as well as in the life of the forest. I don’t really differentiate them. Tangent done!
I hiked on, figuring I would stop at Carters Gap. When I got there around 2:30, Bear Meat and Cassandra Clooney were tenting off the trail away from the shelter. They told me that Obiwan and his friend Eddie Man were heading for Betty’s Creek Gap. It was still early in the day and the hiking had been manageable, so I decided to push on another 3.7 miles to Betty’s Creek to tent for the night. I really don’t like staying in shelters. It is very hard to sleep and I worry more about mice, or getting sick from other hikers. When it is forecasted to rain though, shelter sleeping can be nice because there is no wet tent to pack up in the morning. Tonight and tomorrow it is supposed to rain, so I figure I’m getting wet either way - tenting it is! As I walked past the trail to the shelter I passed an older lady named “Slosh.” She told me she was “probably the slowest thing on the trail.” She said she didn’t like sleeping at the shelters either, so she might go to Betty’s Creek too. As I sit here typing this, it’s 8:32pm and dark, so I’m guessing she found somewhere else nice to hole up for the night.
I hiked a few ups and downs, and the. Along a ridge line full of what looked like dead rhododendron, probably from the fire. The views were incredible off to the east, and another hiker who is camping here tonight helped take a picture with me in it. I returned the favor for him. 
I walked on in solitude, until around a few bends I saw Obiwan and Eddie Man. They joked that they would follow me to camp, and let me pass. I was kind of excited because I wanted the chance to hear their stories and learn more about who they are. Ed previously told me that in addition to his own kids, he takes care of three kids from Kenya. He mentioned something about Bill (Obiwan) helping set up a medical facility for their village back in Kenya. This was in a conversation we had a couple of days ago just north of Dick’s Creek Gap. I ran into him as I was hitting the trail after a short break and he was taking a quick rest himself.
When we got to Betty’s there was a sign posted. They were doing some reforestation so there was no camping within sight of the trail. That limited our options. Ed and Obi pushed on, but I stayed because I needed water and I like to camp where there is water. I guess I will have to get the details on the Kenya story another time. A few other hikers rolled in, and then Steve-O showed up. I cooked and chored, trying to set myself up for a morning in the rain. I made this Mac and cheese, but I tried to cook it in the bag instead of my pot. Even with my cook pouch it was a little crunchy. It had a mushroom truffle flavor to it though, so I didn’t care. I crunched through it and then drank the broth water that was left over. Trail life! I then ate another tuna burrito and two granola bars, and then continued my nightly ritual of ginger turmeric tea. The tea is quite good and is supposed to help with inflammation. I don’t know if it works, but either way I like it. 
Now it was time to hang the bear bag. Remember that snickers? I looked around for a good branch and struggled to find one. To be fair, I was being lazy because I knew I would probably have to get the bear bag down in the rain tomorrow. There was a craggy tree near my tent (not the best place to hang, but sometimes corners get nipped) and i thought I could make it work. I found a good heavy rock for the toss sack and let ‘er rip. Bingo! A good throw it was! The positioning of the rope was a little close to the tree trunk, so I tried to slide it over. Unfortunately, I slid it too far over and now it was too close to another tree. I could just see a raccoon leaning over and grabbing it. I decided this  branch wouldn’t do, so I slowly tried to pull  the rock bag down. Thunk! Ugh.... I managed to pull it right into the crevice of a forked branch, and it was stuck tight! More embarrassing, it was stuck behind the end of someone else’s bear bag attempt. Maybe I should feel better because of that. I really didn’t want to lose my toss sack. If there is one thing Hungry Cat doesn’t do, it’s give up! I decided it was time to try the go go gadget trekking poles again, so I used my gorilla tape to create one long pole again. It wasn’t long enough, BUT there was a bent tree right beside the one the bag was stuck in, so I climbed up onto that tree trunk, braced myself, and tried again. Voila! I had made contact! Now if I could just push it ...a little...... farther...... and over........hmmmmmmph! There, done! It whizzed to the ground with the sound of a zip line. Time to find a new tree. I walked about 30 yards away and there was a big, beautiful, no consequences branch. I got it in the first try. Next time, I’ll be more selective. I posted a photo of my successful food bag hang :-).
Steve-O (I posted a photo of him) asked if he could hang his bag on my line. Perhaps he saw my shenanigans and didn’t want any part of that process. I don’t blame him! I said sure and hung our food bags, and then chatted with him for a bit. He owns a printing company at home and has 15 employees. When he reaches Damascus, he plans to go back to check on his business. If all is well, he’ll come back. We talked a bit about economic and social systems for a bit. You know, the usual light camper banter :-). Then it was time to journal and head to bed. There’s no signal here so I will back post this entry. As I lie here, the rain is pitter pattering on my tent fly. Tomorrow will be a wet one. I intend to hike to Winding Stair Gap and stay in Franklin tomorrow. I’ll get a ride in, sleep overnight, then resupply and hit the trail the next day.  The smokies are coming soon.... I’m so excited ! I need to get my permit for the smokies - I can probably do that in franklin. 
It was such a nice day today. The sun laid off and so did the rain. I’m grateful for a relatively painless day and for the beautiful sound of rain as I fall asleep.","Muskrat Creek Shelter 
",Betty’s Creek Gap,"Mar 05, Mon",16.20
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583757,"I woke to the pitter patter of rain on my tent . No surprise there! I had planned for this the night before. I pulled on my hiking clothes and ran out in the dark to get the bear bags down. I dropped Steve-O’s by his tent, and then ducked back inside my tent for what I like to call “breakfast in bag.” It’s like breakfast in bed, but you leave your legs in your sleeping bag. I set up my pot to boil water in the vestibule area of my tent (an overhang created by the tent fly that keeps rain out of the area immediately in front of the tent - think of it as a tiny mud room). While that was heating, I organized and repacked gear as best I could. The rain outside started coming down heavier. When the water boiled, I made instant coffee (I still feel a little bougie for bringing the Starbucks Via packets!) and my usual breakfast of two packs of full sugar calorie-sodden maple brown sugar oatmeal. The breakfast in bag felt wonderful! With the rain peppering the outside of the tent it kind of felt like waking up to the rain, but staying in bed to read. I finished getting my gear organized as much as I could. Now I needed to brush my teeth, filter a little water, and...well... take care of the morning constitution. Now, on the trail we talk about bodily functions, namely because we are living like cave people and so everything becomes more “it is what it is.” By mid-day on day one i was a professional snot rocket launcher. It’s just life in the woods - you deal. I’m not going to say that squatting over a dirt hole i’ve just dug, hands dripping with mud from the rain running off my trowel, in the pouring rain sucks. It doesn’t. It just is. But the real trick is not getting the toilet paper soaked. There is something about toilet paper that, once wet, it just doesn’t ever really “work right.” Anyway, these special challenges are just part of adapting and dealing with the trail on the trail’s terms. 
So once I was done those activities, my feet were already getting wet. I had my rain gear on and must have had it adjusted better today because it seemed to be doing an ok job (chuckle chuckle, I hadn’t left camp yet. I ripped down my tent, enjoying yanking up the wet and muddy tent stakes. Then I used the same muddy hands to wipe the water off my face, giving myself a nice mud mask. I probably looked like Martin Sheen in that famous scene in Apocalypse Now where he raises his head out of the muddy water with crazy eyes. Ay least I’m not Kurtz, right? The trail teaches me to be grateful for little things. Besides, people go to the beauty salon and pay to have mud rubbed all over their faces; I was really just exfoliating for free. I got all my tent bits up and set out to hike. 
It wasn’t too long before the precipitation intensified. I pushed on. I had a plan. My friend Chris lives with her partner Ron about 11 miles away from Franklin. We know each other from kayaking, having met on the river years before. We don’t know each other that well, but I had camped near the Green River Gamelands with them previously and we had bumped into each other here and there - enough to know I liked them and they are good people. I also was interested in their life choices. I knew they had chosen to leave city life and go live on a mountain in rural North Carolina. I’m always interested when people follow non-conventional paths. I had been meaning to catch up with them for some time, so I thought I would drop her a text to see if she wanted to grab lunch or dinner in Franklin. She had reached out previously and very generously offered to let me stay at their place. I don’t like putting people out (and it’s hard for me to ask for help!), but she responded to my text and asked if I would like to stay for the night. Maybe it was the weather, or maybe it was the teachings of the trail, but something told me I should accept such a gracious offer, so I did. We quickly set a plan to meet in Franklin in the afternoon, as she had a morning appointment in Asheville. I was really excited to see her (unfortunately Ron is out of town on business, so I’ll miss him this time) and catch up as it has been a while since I’d seen them for more than just river banter. That all put some spring in my step and I hiked on. The rain intensified.... I started to feel mysterious rivlets running stealthily down my legs. How in the HECK does the water get inside my rain gear? I just don’t get it! I ran into Slosh again. She was pushing along slowly and carefully, as that is her mantra. I’m pretty sure she’ll make it to Kathadin.
The climbing got steeper, and before you know it I was having to claw my way up boulders and rock face to get up the steep trail. It was raining hard and slippery, so I moved slowly and deliberately. With a little patience I made it to the summit of Albert Mountain (5,250ft). There was a fire tower on top of Albert Mountain that I would have liked to have climbed on a clear day, but today it was just pure whiteout - no dice.
The trail evened out at the top of Albert and I soon ran into someone facing away from me, hunched over, under an umbrella. I called out a hearty “hello!” and the mysterious figure spun around revealing a young girl with a piece of pita bread in her mouth. This Hungry Cat understands! She introduced herself as Life Alert. Said she got the name because she falls every day. I found that hysterical, but also felt bad for her because it cant feel good to fall on rocks with a pack on. She told me she was just coming off of two successive zeros (zero mile days) due to injury. Those days were clear and sunny and she came back just in time for the rain. Then she told me that there is a daily shuttle that goes into Franklin that only costs $3, but that it gets to Winding Stair Gap at 12:30. At the time it was still before 11 and I thought that I had traveled farther than I really had, so I thought I might make it. I kept hiked on, motivated to keep a solid pace. By this time I was wet in many places. I think my rain gear starts to give up at a certain saturation point.
Galumphing forwards, I finally ran into two gents who were at the campsite with me at Betty’s. One of them was walking back to the shelter I had just passed. We were at Rock Gap and apparently the same shuttle goes there. He thought there might be a schedule back in the shelter so was going back to look. Regardless, I wanted to hike to Winding Stair Gap, so I decided to press on. I asked him what time it was and he replied “11:40.” Yowsers!! I had 50 minutes to make it 3.7 miles!! I started hiking faster. Soon I passed Eddie Man and Obiwan on a steep climb. I pushed harder. On level stretches I started jogging a little, my pack lighter with not much water reserve. In my head I knew I wouldn’t make it, but my will was driving me. I pounded on. And then I stopped. I realized the whole thing was silly. My will wasn’t going to get me on that bus. My will might get me hurt though! Also, who cares if I didn’t make the $3 shuttle. I could probably get into town for $20, or thumb a ride. I slowed down to my normal pace, now at peace. It will be what it will be, and I don’t get to decide - the trail will take care of me. 
I finally started hearing the sounds of a road. Then I could see the parking lot! It was definitely an exclamation point moment for me, as I knew I would soon be warm, dry, and fed. I descended the last step into the parking lot and walked towards a row of cars. I didn’t even have a chance to put my pack down, get my phone and check the time before a guy got out of a van, came over, and asked “are you a thru hiker?” He said he had thru hiked back in the 80s and was retired now in Franklin. He goes up to the gap occasionally just to see if hikers need rides. He then offered me a free ride into Franklin! These people are called “trail angels.” I was very excited and we stood and chatted for a bit. All that silly worry over a bus for nothing. He asked if there were other hikers behind me, and I told him I thought Obiwan and Eddie Man were about 45-50 minutes back. Then, just as we were about to load my stuff in his van, what pulls up but the local bus! I told him if he wanted to wait and grab Obiwan and Eddie Man, I would hop on the bus, and that’s what I did. The bus is run by the county to funnel hikers into Franklin - we are a big part of their economy. The driver was willing to take us anywhere in Franklin. He had looped back around to Winding Stair Gap after checking Rock Gap. I saw Steve-O and another guy on the bus. About then Chris texted me and said she could meet a bit earlier, closer to 2pm. I told the bus driver to drop me off with the other two guys at the Budget Inn. Franklin is not exactly the Big Apple - I could walk anywhere in 5-10 minutes. I got out at the Budget Inn, thanked the driver, and rolled my pack back on. As I did this, I heard the manager telling the other guys that the Inn was full and they would have to go to the bunkhouse. At least they had beds! There was an outfitter across the street, so I walked over to get a new fuel canister. I had 3 major things to do other than have fun with my friend and resupply. I needed toilet paper, a new fuel canister, and a permit for the Great Smokey Mountains National Park that I would arrive at in due time. When I went into the outfitter, who was there but Ron Haven, “El Snake!” He seemed to be busy with something, but I said hi anyway. I purchased the gas and then headed up into town to get food. Time to eat!!!
Chris had suggested a place called Motor Company Grill. It couldn’t have been more perfect. It was a 50s style diner and very hiker friendly. I was a muddy, wet, mess. I set my pack down in their courtyard and started stripping off rain gear and wet stuff to make myself more presentable. I stripped down to my smart wool base layer and pants. I was wet, but at least not dripping. I went in and asked if I should leave my pack outside. They said “bring it in, we’ll watch it for you!” They were so nice. I think they thought I was worried someone would take it. On the contrary, I was worried they would smell it or me and either or both would be offensive to their clients. Nope! Motor City is downright cool. I sat down with my ditty bag (dry bag where I keep my “trail wallet,” phone and charger), ordered a cup of coffee and water, the. Went to the bathroom to clean up. I looked in the mirror and realized I haven’t seen myself really since the start of the trip, other than taking a selfie. It was horrifying!!! Ok, maybe not that bad, but still. I had some dirt and leaf chunks stuck in my beard. My beard had the fullness and consistency of a 16yr old with the bristly, wiley white hairs of an old man. It’s not a good look for me. I used to be able to grow a nice thick full beard 10 years ago. Now my face looks like I should shave with rogaine. I cleaned up as best I could and went back out.
The place had lots of food options. As I looked at the menu, Chris walked in! She gave me a hug even though I was disgusting and sat down to chat. She had already eaten, so I ordered a burger and onion rings for me. The coffee kept flowing and Chris and I started catching up, as well as made a plan. We would go to Ingles first so I could resupply and she could get a few things, and then go back to her and Ron’s so that I could get showered, hang gear to dry, and do laundry. Then we would go into Sylva for dinner. 
I destroyed the burger. I had wing sauce all over my fingers, and I wiped that on my onion rings and licked everything clean. Then, as I was considering something else, the waitress said “we have free sundaes for hikers.” What?!?! Yes please! I ate the hot fudge sundae in about 30 seconds. It was time to go. Motor Company Grill was really fantastic!
We shoved my pack into Chris’ Jeep and headed to Ingles. I mixed up my resupply this time and got some ramen. I got more M&Ms as well, of course. We drove back out of Franklin towards the town of Sylva, where Chris and Ron live. Their house sits up in the mountains with an overlook of the valley below. The views are quite stunning, and the fog, light and clouds are continually morphing. It’s Appalachia at its finest! When we got to the house, to Chris’s surprise there were two contractors on the roof. She wasn’t expecting them without a call first, but they showed up anyway and just started working. They were throwing flashing pieces off the roof. 
We went inside and into the garage where I could air out my tent and gear. It was amazing! Ron and Chris are kayakers and campers, among other things, and they had a great setup to hang dry wet gear. They had a clothesline and fans all around, as well as a dehumidifier. It was incredible just to know that my stuff would get dry. 
Next on the docket was a shower. I felt like I was at a royal spa with hot water and a good shower head. Chris even gave me some clothes to borrow so that I could wash all of mine. It was amazing. While that was happening, we sat and talked and I got to catch up more on what was going on in her and Ron’s life, etc. It was really a lovely afternoon. While we talked Chris baked bread for the morning.
When everything was dry, I put my clothes back on, sported my camp loafers (kelly green crocs), and we drove into Sylva for dinner. We ate at Guadalupe. They use all locally raised ingredients. I finally got some good solid veggies in me! We talked over dinner about all sorts of stuff, including the different journeys we were both on. I also told her about the last little bit of magic that happened in Hiawassee. I’ll tell you all about that in a later journal entry! 
After dinner, we looked back down Main Street at the courthouse at the end of the road on the hill. It was quite stunning and apparently is often used in photographs and films.  We had one last stop, and that was to get ice cream at a local shop called Jack the Dipper! They do warm waffle cones there, and it was honestly the best waffle cone I’ve ever had, not even a close contest! I had blueberry cheesecake and chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. It was divine and the staff was super friendly. After that, it was time to go back to bed. It was really awesome catching up with Chris. I really look forward to hanging out with her and Ron post my thru hike, especially so they can meet Gillian. And of course we all have to go to Jack the Dipper. That place is wickedly good.
I went to bed feeling grateful to have such nice and kind people in my life, grateful for everything Chris had done for me, and excited for breakfast in the morning! I am, after all, Hungry Cat.Postscripts:#1 wondering about the photo in this entry? Chris is holding coconut oil. She told me to use it on my face as a moisturizer, sunscreen and windscreen. I did today, and not only did it work great, but my face smelled like the beach! Also, the cuckoo clock behind us is one of Ron’s family heirlooms from the Black Forest region in Germany. It came over by boat, and then from the coast to the Midwest on a covered wagon. They had it restored and it still works!#2 I’ve posted more photos. At some point I’ll figure out how to have more than one in my entries.","Betty’s Creek Gap

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583761,"In the morning I woke up at 6:45 to falling snow. Awesome! Even, better, I woke up to it in a nice, warm, and amazingly comfortable guest bed. Yay! I journaled a bit to try and catch up, and then took another shower. Another shower!! It felt heavenly of course. Chris went above and beyond (even more than she had already) and made chili eggs with meat and we ate those with fresh bread and jam. I had three huge pieces of bread. We sat and chatted for a while and looked at the beautiful view outside their home. Then it was time to pack up and head back to the trail. I joked with Chris that I wanted to take their guest bed on the trail with me. It was so comfortable that I slept like a log and barely moved! Two other pieces of trail magic that Chris bestowed upon me: a few safety pins and a sewing needle. She read that I had forgotten a needle. Also, the safety pins were a great idea. Future thru hikers, tuck two of those in your kit. As I lose weight I can use those to adjust clothing. My rain pants already need cinching in. 
We took a few photos and it was time to go. Chris dropped me off back at Winding Stair Gap and said goodbye for now, wishing me the best and providing some moral support, as the trail was now blanketed in snow. I set off hiking.
The day started with a climb up to Siler Bald. It was quite cold, but soon I was hiking in just my base layer. I like to hike with my rain jacket on until I reach a good solid warmth. Then, before I start sweating, I take it off, but leave my buff on under my hat and my gloves on. It’s a little chilly on the north faces of the mountains, but chilly is ok. What I don’t want to do is sweat, as that gets cold really fast and it’s harder to warm up. So far this is serving me well. The snow on the ground was light until I hit the north side of Siler Bald. After that the trail was slippery with compacted snow. 
I passed a few hikers, including many day hikers going south. Everyone looked so cold! I soon came upon a young woman hiking with her dog. Her dog was huge! I said hello and she introduced them by trail names. She was Faith Walker and the dog was Dirt Bear. He was a beautiful dog; she said the breed was Akita. The dog’s regular name was Charlie, and as we chatted about how far away the shelter was, Dirt Bear proceeded to eat a small sapling. That’s right - he ate it. A small shrub. Gone. If ever there was a good dog for the trail, he was it. His paws were massive and he was as tall as the top of my hips with a thick coat of fur. I was jealous of the fur, and quickly touched my 16year old white patchy stubble. Sigh.... there is a photo of these hikers in my photo gallery. 
I pushed on to reach the summit of Wayah Bald. They are almost done building a new fire tower there. I confirmed with Chris that the fires that ravaged the Southern Nantahala forest were two years ago, not last year. Even the tower at Wayah burned down! The views from the summit at Wayah were stunning! Definitely the best views of the trip so far. If you’re into panorama shots, this was the ku de tat! Maybe when the trip is done I’ll have it tattooed on the insides of my eyelids so I can always see it. That’s a thing they can do, right?
After Wayah I started descending to eventually reach the shelter. I arrived at Wayah Bald Shelter at 4:20, and the place was jam packed. People were renting right by the trail. I decided to push just over another mile to get to Licklog Gap to tent for the night. It was lower in elevation so would likely be a few degrees warmer, and less snow. I half wondered if I would arrive to a similar crowd, but I did not! There were a handful of good spots left and about 6 other guys there. 
I proceeded with my camp setup and chores. Chris told me I should do a whole entry on camp chores. There’s a lot to do and organize! I try and get it all done before dark too, because that is when the biting cold hits. I’ll write about that another day. I started to boil water to make my dinner and tea and noticed one of the older guys at camp had built a fire. Yes!!! Now, you may think that we have fires every night on the trail, but we don’t! It’s too wet many nights, too cold, or we just don’t have the energy after hiking all day and doing camp chores to start one. This fire was the first I’d seen on the trail! I joined the guys around the fire and ate my Knorr rice side. I had the Dirty Rice and Pasta blend, as well as a tortilla and tuna pack. It was delightful! Then I ate some chocolate wafers I bought at Ingles in Franklin - absolutely godly. 
It is freezing as I type this. It is supposed to get down to 19 tonight, with a high of 32 tomorrow. I plan to get close to the Nantahala Outdoor Center tomorrow. I bought my smokies permit and Chris helped me print it off, so I’m all set there. Also, Trail Angel Chris gave me a roll of golden trail tickets (toilet paper), which was awesome because they don’t sell singles at Ingles (such poetry!). 
As I type, I can hear the tinkling sound of snow hitting the tent. It isn’t supposed to snow today or tomorrow, so I doubt we’ll get much. There is definitely some cold wet weather coming our way soon! It’s the AT after all ;-). 
It was such a great day! I must give a huge thanks to Chris and Ron for basically taking care of me for a day. I had a blast and look forward to adventures with them when this hike is done. I’m thankful that I’m warm tonight because I’m sure a lot of people around the world are not. I’m also  grateful for the continued guest book messages! Luba, you didn’t sign your name but I know which one is yours! Good lines indeed! Abbey, thank you so much for the offer in PA!! More than anything, I hope you do get out on the trail - you can do it!! If Hungry Cat can do it, you’re a shoe in! Maybe a boot in is more appropriate? Maybe I’ll see you in PA - that would be awesome! As we like to say out here, we’re “heading north, one step at a time.” Time for Hungry Cat to dream about breakfast!
Goodnight all~ Tomorrow is going to be awesome!","Winding Stair Gap (Franklin)

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583799,"I slept fitfully last night. It was super cold at about 19 degrees, so I had clothes on inside my sleeping bag, as well as my water and filter in the bag, so there was a lot going on. It was basically like a pajama party in my sleeping bag for anything I didn’t want to freeze, including me! It was hard to force myself to get out of my sleeping bag. I basically had it sealed off at the top (it’s a mummy bag) and was curled inside it like a fetus. I was strategic the night before and made sure I had my puffy and fleece in the bag even if I wasn’t wearing them (I wore the puffy part of the night) so that I could have warm clothes on right away. I heard others at camp moving about and the sun was coming up, so I made my move. 
First, I grabbed my food bag off the line. Then I set about getting some water boiling. One of the guys had started a fire again - yay! I took my trail kitchen over by the fire and made breakfast (boiled water for oatmeal and coffee) while taking a fire-based hiker shower. What’s a hiker shower you ask? Well, it’s what I’m calling the utilization of any pungent smell to cover up the stench that is me. Smoke from the fire will do nicely!
Despite a clear forecast, it had snowed overnight. It wasn’t snowing when I woke up though. It took me forever to get out of camp. As I started to leave I saw Faith Walker and Dirt Bear again. We chatted for a few minutes. She’s from GA near Augusta. She said she couldn’t get warm last night and sat in her sleeping bag shaking violently with everything she had on. I guess she finally warmed up....
I started hiking with all my layers. Not too long into the hike I found a glove. I picked it up to bring along to try and reunite it with it’s owner. It was massive, so I figured I would just look for huge men and ask if it was theirs. I wore it over my other glove. 
It started snowing again, and it would snow pretty much the entire rest of the day until I got to camp. I spent an hour stopping and starting and changing out layers. I didn’t want to sweat, but moving fast was hard on compacted snow and mud, so I didn’t want to take too much off and be cold. Later on I finally undressed to my underwear in the middle of the trail to get my tights out from under my pants. That got me down to just a base layer and rain gear, which is where I like to be. An older guy passed me changing and said “you like to keep your pack off more than on.” Awesome.
I saw a blue trail off to the right once I got going again. It said “Rocky Bald.” Well, I came out here to see stuff, so I took it. It was short but very steep and covered in snow. I scrambled my way to the top and the view was nothing but grey. Womp! Oh well, I tried. I climbed back down and continued on. As I approached Tellico Gap the views were stunning. Hiking in the snow really is gorgeous, and better than rain in my book! I got down to Tellico Gap and I heard someone shout my way “hot dogs.” What? Yep! Trail magic. There was a lady parked at Tellico Gap grilling hot dogs. She also had soda and water for refilling bottles. I took a hot dog and pretty much shoved the whole thing in my mouth. It was divine. Her name was Mama Goose and she had thru hiked the AT in 2013. She’s also hiked the PCT and the Mountain to Sea trail. Pretty amazing!  She lives in Murphy, NC. She said she was going to leave and that we should eat another hot dog, so myself and another hiker doubled down. Man, it was good and warm. I was planning just to eat bars and hike through lunch, so this was awesome. Also, it was still below freezing so I wasn’t looking forward to getting water. Being able to top up there was really a nice luxury. I thanked her profusely and took a picture. Check out my photos to see Mama Goose! 
After Tellico Gap, the climb to Wesser Bald starts. It was enough to make me perspire a bit, even with below freezing temps. At the top there was a lookout tower, so I climbed that to look at the grey and snowy skies. It made me cold again so I had to keep moving. I trekked on along the ridge line and the snow started to ease up a little. For a while I had been slipping and sliding on compacted snow, particularly on the downhills. The views atop Wesser Bald ridge line were stunning, and at one point the sun was visible in one of the valleys far below. I took a quick video of it for some folks I used to work with. A special mountain hello!
I kept descending and noticed my trekking poles felt heavy. I looked and they both looked kind of like fudge sickles, or burnt marshmallows on a stick. The tips had frozen mud and ice fused to them. That will probably melt off tomorrow. Check out the picture in my photos. The one on the left had a little Stonehenge face to it.
On the way down the mountain the snow mostly stopped and I noticed the green returning to the landscape. I saw a tiny pink flower blooming boldly in the trail. I took a picture. Later I sent it to my mom and she identified it as a sharp lobed hepatica. I bet it has some kind of Appalachian Mountain name, like “devils broach” or something like that. Apparently it’s one of the first to bloom here. Looking at the tiny thing in the middle of the trail, I couldn’t help but think of that famous picture of the guy standing in front of the tank at Tiananmen Square in the late 80s. I’m lucky I saw the flower and now even more glad that I took a picture of it. I think it was Emerson who said “the earth smiles on flowers.” I felt like that flower was somehow a smile just for me. In terms of animals, I’ve mostly seen grey squirrels, lots of Dark Eyed Juncos and a few Black Capped Chickadees (birds). I saw one garter snake. Another hiker this morning said he saw a coyote. Chris had told me there were a ton of them here.
I passed Wesser Bald Shelter and ran into Swagman again. I stopped to check my AT guidebook, and two day hikers came by with their dog. I asked them about the shelter and we started talking. They offered swagman and I a tangerine each. Yay! Actual fruit and nutrition! Their names were Debbie and Irene, and the little dog’s name was Petey. I took a photo with them, thanked them and set about with a jaunt in my step as I peeled my tangerine. The explosion of juice in my mouth was almost too much. Hungry Cat like!!! Here’s what happened next: nom nom nom nom nom nom nom.
I rolled up to A. Rufus Morgan shelter at about 4:45. Not bad - a full day of hiking. I set about camp chores and made some ramen noodles. I hung my food bag line and offered to clip in the lady’s next to me - branches were scarce. I’m getting better at this bear bag thing :-).
I didn’t fall today or freeze. I didn’t shy away from another cold night in the woods. I could have walked one more mile and fought the masses for a bunk at Nantahala Outdoor Center. I didn’t. I’m starting to settle in and get used to the uncomfortable. I felt good about that today. 
The glove - I finally caught up to people who knew whose it was. It was a guy I camped with last night. He was headed to NOC tonight, and at my campsite a guy named Rivers said he was headed to NOC and knew who it was, so he would deliver it. Hopefully it completed its long journey home. 
I’m grateful for a day full of trail magic and gorgeous views, and for the beautiful snow we had today. In two days I’ll be at Fontana dam, and then the smokies! The weather is looking wet after tomorrow. Hopefully it won’t rain too hard/much........muhahahah! Of course it will - it’s the mountains! It’ll be fine either way. Maybe I’ll see yogi bear and we can compare diets.  
Don A, thanks for your note. You know, it took me years to get to where I was ready to thru hike the AT. I look back fondly at some of that trip planning and journal reading. I really enjoyed Yo Teach’s and Red Panda’s trail journals, and they helped me keep a dream alive. You’ll get your shot, and when you do let me know!
To the Joneses, too funny! I can’t keep up with you (sorry, bad pun). Ron Haven is like the AT’s version of the most interesting man in the world. I’ll have a chance to chat with him more some day!
Time to zip into my sleeping bag. Tomorrow is supposed to be nice weather. Good hiking! Hungry Cat out!","Lick Log Gap
",A. Rufus Morgan Shelter,"Mar 08, Thu",14.20
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583895,"I thought a lot about fried chicken today. It was a weird craving as I don’t really eat fried chicken. I also craved a root beer - Barq’s maybe. Root beer was a random craving; the fried chicken thing did have a genesis. Let me get to that.
I didn’t sleep well last night. It was cold, windy, and I tented on a slope. It was just enough slope to where I spent the night clawing my way back on top of my air pad. I knew I wanted to do some bigger miles today, but it was hard to get out of the bag this morning with the cold. I ran outside to get my food down from where I hung it. I then sprinted back to my tent and tucked my legs into my sleeping bag and decided to have breakfast in bag. I boiled water in the vestibule of my tent while organizing and packing things. I had coffee and two oatmeal packets. Today I wanted to go right to my base later only plus rain gear hiking outfit. It was supposed to hit 55 degrees, and while it was freezing this morning, I figured I could hike fast to get my body temperature up. I pulled off my tights to switch over to my hiking pants. In doing so, I looked at my legs. On the trail, I go days without even knowing what I look like. I could have dirt all over my face - who knows! My legs didn’t look that much more muscular. They were pale white though (nothing new) and had lots of little bumps on them. The first thing I thought was that my legs looked like chicken or turkey with that paleness and the bumps. They looked like gross dead bird legs. And that made me think of fried chicken. Hungry Cat makes the mental leap to food! It was just one of those weird things that went through my head (haha, chicken legs!). Little did I know that thoughts of a giant bucket of KFC would haunt me throughout the day.
I got hiking and burned through the mile or so to the NOC. I got there just after 9am and the outfitter and general store didn’t open until 10, so I decided to wait. I chatted with a fellow hiker for a bit, then realized they had restrooms and went to go clean up. Washing my hands felt fantastic. A lot of days I just sort of splash them with water and then use hand sanitizer on top of the grime. After my bird bath, I went around the corner to the laundry and went inside. Some hikers were in there waiting because it was very warm and they also had a few power outlets. Bingo! I ran back across the street, grabbed my pack and took it over by the laundry. Cole was sitting outside making ramen or something. I went inside and Motorcycle Mama let me plug into her free USB port as she was already charging. She camped at the same spot last night and was the lady I bear bagged for. I could charge for about 10 minutes before the NOC stores would open. There was a guy in the laundry room as well. I didn’t recognize him. He was talking about needing to hitch a ride to Asheville to resolve some “legal matters.” He said this to me. I didn’t really want to know what those issues were so I didn’t ask. It’s interesting what people will share with you on the trail. 
It was kind of cool seeing NOC this way. I’d been there a good handful of times to kayak, but had never paid attention to where exactly the AT passed through, or what hiker facilities are there. They have a lot! When they opened up, I first went to the outfitter. I wanted to get a small backup fuel canister. It takes longer to boil water and cook in this cold! When I went inside, they had a lot of good hiker food. I wanted to resupply here as I had heard that there is not much in Fontana Village. I splurged and picked up 3 mountain house meals. I love their chili Mac! They also had Iced Gingerbread cliff bars, which is odd because they are a seasonal flavor. Gillian suggested I order some bars on amazon before I left, so I ordered pumpkin pie. I wanted the iced gingerbread too, but for some reason didn’t get them. I’ve loved the pumpkin pie ones, so seeing iced gingerbread made Hungry Cat very excited! I purchased a few of those and some other assorted flavors. Then I went across the street to the convenience store to purchase other things, like tuna packs, oatmeal, M&Ms - you know, the essentials. I’m pretty sure my blood mercury levels are approaching insanity-causing levels! It’s good and easy protein though. In my mind that’s what happens when you ingest too much mercury - you go insane. Curious, I looked up what really happens. Symptoms include mood swings, irritability, headaches, insomnia, nervousness, abnormal sensations, muscle atrophy, and “emotional changes.” So I guess insanity might not happen, but you might feel like you just worked a hard 9 hours at your job. 
Anyway, the guy at NOC was nice and let me take my shopping basket outside to refill my pack. I did that and realized my food bag was the size of Gillian’s Prius. Oh well, I’ll eat it, and it will get me through the smokies, or at least to Newfound Gap where I can get to Gatlinburg. At the general store there (I got the bars and fuel at the outfitter and the other stuff at the general store) I purchased an “Italian sandwich.” They had a microwave so I warmed it up, and as I did I chatted with the gal working there. She was living out of her van and told me how hard it was to get someone to rig the van for solar power. She said she and her partner lived in it full time, and also had a cat in the van! Hungry Cat was interested... Shane Carlson, if you’re reading this maybe you should get solar power for your daughters caravan! I think I just felt you wince ;-)
Caravan lady and I talked a little kayaking shop. She is a kayaker as well. My sandwich finished heating and I walked back across the street. I bit into that sandwich, and all the heavens exploded behind my closed eyelids. It was delicious! The salami and cheese. Nom nom nom! When my eyeballs rolled back down into normal positions, I set out onto the bridge across the Nantahala river to where the AT picks up on the other side. I had lost a lot of time as it was now 10:30, but I figured a long 17 mile day was doable. Sure - a fully resupplied pack with water as well, why not? Little did I know what was in store for me. The trail took a sharp turn uphill as colonel sanders danced in my head.
Remember back when I said that uphills are my jam? I’d like to strike that statement from the record, your honor. I feel like the trail gods heard me say that and decided they would shove uphill after uphill down my throat, with no opportunity to swallow in between. I found myself channeling that really skinny Japanese guy who wins all the hotdog eating championships by shoving 70 or so hotdogs down his throat in something like 30 seconds. I needed to be him, but with uphills, not hotdogs (though I wanted hotdogs). Alas, I was no champion. I huffed and puffed with my bloated pack as the climb up Swim Bald just kept going. And when I got to the top there was another intense climb to the top of Cheoah Bald. I paused on Cheoah Bald to look at the amazing view. The weather had been gorgeous all day and visibility was grand. A lady is chatted with before was on the bald. I found out her name is Dicey, after the handkerchief she carries that had a dice print. She carries a large point and shoot camera around her neck and takes a lot of photos, so to my reader that asked about this before, she is doing it! She’s the only thru hiker I’ve seen so far with a large point and shoot camera, but the camera looks quite sophisticated so I’m guessing she is pretty into photography. I asked if she’d seen any birds of prey from the bald (that’s not a weird opener out here at all!). I thought about fried chicken immediately after asking that. She said no, and then I mentioned that I hadn’t seen any interesting wildlife like coyotes or foxes yet, and then we had a 10 minute conversation about animal poop. Dicey said she’d seen fox and coyote poop on the trail. I told her I wouldn’t know what that looked like unless I saw the animal doing it with the morning paper. She told me that coyote poop looks like a dog, but has a lot of hair in it. She said they often poop on the trail itself. She then said that fox poo is like a coyote but smaller.... ok, got it! 
About that time, a lady came up to the bald heading south and said “may I join you? I hate to be a Debbie downer but....” Stop! Anytime someone says this, (i) they are about to be the thing they say they hate being, and (ii) they obviously don’t hate it or they wouldn’t be it, so why lie about hating it? It’s a silky expression. Anyway, she finished the sentence with “...I’ve seen balds a lot balder than this.” Cheoah Bald is really just a grassy patch, not a stone bald. But I mean, if non grassy true stone balds are what I love for, I would just search for that on the intrawebgoogle machine and find a stony bald. You can google search “Cheoah Bald” and see what it looks like. Anyway, I acknowledged that it was grassier than some. Then Dicey and I headed on. No Debbie downers for us! We loved the view on the grassy knoll bald! In about ten feet I saw some poop and asked “what about this one? there’s a little hair in it.” Dicey responded “nah. That’s just a dog that’s been licking itself.”
I left Dicey behind to get my miles in. I figured the tough part was over. Then I hit the downhill into Stekoah Gap. It was pretty brutal, and as I descended into the gap I was feeling very tired. My feet ached and were ready to be done. Surely I’ve done the hardest part though! I turned around a bend and passed Swagman, who was just getting up after falling in the mud. He said he was ok. Mud on the trail can be really tricky and definitely slows the hiking down. I pushed on. I saw a trash can at Stekoah Gap and got rid of my garbage. Finding a trash can on the trail is kind of like going to a therapist. You carry the garbage around with you and put it out of your mind, but when you dump it all out it feels so good! Unfortunately, when I was repacking my bag I noticed that my left bootlace had snapped. Ugh! It looked like the hook from my gaiters had worn away the lace. Luckily it had snapped near the bottom and only the toe box was loose; the ankle area was still tightly in place. I uploaded photos of this (and also how I fixed it later). I decided to hike on rather than take the time for field repairs. It was holding and I knew I would not have much time before dark (and cold) when I rolled into camp. 
Climbing out of Stekoah Gap was again brutal, and after a while I hit the last big climb of the day, known as Jacob’s Ladder. I’ll never say uphills are my jam again! I promise.... I finally came into Brown Fork Shelter and it was packed. No shelter space was left, and all of the established campsites were taken. Drat! I looked around and went back behind the shelter. There was a flattish spot with a nice view of the privy. It would have to do. I set about pitching my tent, enjoying the wafting smells of human nature gifting my nostrils with their essence. That Michael Jackson song passed through my mind. “If they say Why, why? Tell them that it’s human nature....” Also tell them it stinks!
My tent pitched, I scrambled down the steep hill to the water source. I felt like I could barely lift my feet. Then it was time for food. The kids at the shelter had a fire going, so I took my trail kitchen up there to make dinner. I had Mountain house chili Mac. While it was cooking, I talked with a hiker named Joe Cool. He used to be in the Army and still looks very very young. Maybe 24. He was talking about some organization that has stipends for military vets that want to thru hike. He said that Mama Goose told him about it. Apparently she was in the navy for quite a number of years. It sounded pretty awesome. When my meal was cooked, I ate watching the sunset with the shelter kids. They were there on spring break, from Wilmington, NC. One of them had thru hiked in 2013, so I asked him a bit about the shelter at Fontana Dam. I also met a hiker from New Zealand called Traveler. He was super friendly and we talked briefly. I told him that Gillian and I would love to go to New Zealand. He said that February was a good time to go. 
With the sun down, it was time to get into the tent. I stripped into my sleeping clothes and stuffed my puffy in my sleeping bag in case I needed it later. The wind was really picking up. I was camped kind of on a ridge, and while my wind exposure wasn’t too bad, I could hear it howling nearby. I had successfully strung up a line earlier, but had not hung my food bag. I was still hungry so I shoved a granola bar in my mouth. I always try to have all food, anything I’ve cooked with, and all wrappers/trash in my food bag when I hang it. It’s good practice. However, then I saw my M&Ms and knew I needed those later. Despite my better judgment, I hung the food bag and kept my M&Ms.
I got in my tent and organized my gear while eating M&Ms. I fixed my boot lace by tying a double overhand stopper knot to join the two laces and cinch them together. That should do the trick. I laid down to journal and immediately noticed the pitch on which I tented was again slanted just enough to be awkward. I tried to finish my journal, but kept falling asleep. I would finish tomorrow. Originally I wanted to get a shelter spot as we were expecting rain in the morning. It’s easier to get out of camp when I don’t have to take down a wet tent. Oh well, let the rain come! I wanted to make it another 12 miles or so to Fontana Dam tomorrow. I was hurting from the 17 miles, but no blisters or major issues. I could do it. I was dog tired though, and my shoulders and back ached a bit from the trekking pole work to help me with the hills. 
I ended the day incredibly grateful for the good weather and beautiful views, and for the reminder that whenever in life I have the thought “I’ve got this,” I probably haven’t yet learned everything there is to learn. I thanked the trees today that helped me down some muddy, steep sections of the trail. In a weird turn of events, the chili Mac had somehow driven away my fried chicken craving, for now....Tomorrow, rain or shine, I would hike on.","A. Rufus Morgan Shelter

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583899,"I woke up at about 5:30am. The wind was still blowing, but not as bad as the night before. I smiled when I realized it wasn’t raining. I slept fitfully the night before. Despite all the rain, the air is so dry. I feel like I need the roto rooter man to come work on my nostrils at the end of the day. Thar’s gold in them thar hills somewhere! I tossed and turned a bit more, then got out of bed at 6. I set about getting my gear ready and my wet weather hiking outfit on. It wasn’t raining now, but the forecast said it would. I moved as quickly as possible. I wanted to get as much distance as I could before the rain came to hopefully take a little of the slosh factor out of my day. I had almost 13 miles to cover to get to the famous Fontana Hilton Shelter. This is actually the shelter name because it is one of the nicest shelters on the AT. It’s big and clean, has a water pump, fire pit, solar phone charging station, bathroom and heated communal shower. Yep, awesome! You know what it doesn’t have? A ladder to get to the upper bunks. I’ll get to that. 
Admittedly, I was in such a hurry to get going that I didn’t make my normal breakfast or even brush my teeth. I just popped a snickers bar into my mouth and hit the trail! Good thing my dentist isn’t reading this. There was a couple who came into camp last night quite late. They had rented immediately behind the shelter, farther up “privy hill” than I. They were gone when I woke, so they must have left super early. 
The first part of the hike was a short but steep downhill. My feet were sore from the day before. I continued down into Brown Fork Gap and then quickly got pounded by a steep uphill called Bushnell knob. I was tired. I drank a lot of water and, since it hadn’t started raining, I took off my rain jacket as I was starting to get hot. I hiked on across lots of large rock fields. The boulders were large and strewn about in great cascades down the sides of the slopes. I couldn’t help but wonder if bears ever used some of the larger crevices as dens. Some of the rocks were covered with a beautiful green felt coat of moss.it was stunning. In a couple of places, underground streams were visible through the cracks between the rocks, as if they flowed into some secret cave somewhere. I picture that cave in the third Indiana Jones movie where he has to do the leap of faith, but it could be something different for you. I needed to get more water, and stopped at a beautiful water source (picture in gallery) with huge icicles hanging like stalactites. There was still snow on the northern face of the mountain. 
I passed a guy boiling water in a pot and he asked me if I was going to Fontana. I told him yes, and that I was trying to make progress before the rain really kicked in. He told me he read that it wouldn’t start raining until 4. Five minutes later, it started raining.
At first the rain was light. I hiked on without my rain jacket. Then it picked up a bit, so I donned the jacket and trudged on. It never poured during the day, but it did rain lightly for the rest of the time. As far as hiking in the rain goes, this was ok. I got excited when I saw the dam, but I still had a ways to go. I got more excited when I thought the hwy 28 road crossing was the shelter, but then I still had a little over a mile. The last mile of trail took me over one final smaller climb, and then along the side of beautiful Fontana Lake to the shelter. When I got to the shelter, the two guys from Mount Pleasant were there! I hadn’t seen them for a while. There was a lot of space left (for a change!), so I decided to take a spot on the top level. I thought it would be fun and I might get better rest. The shelter seemed almost too good to be true. I went up and had a HOT shower! In my normal life I would probably look at that shower and say “no thanks.” In trail life, that shower was like a Four Seasons bathroom! I guess that’s why they call it the Hilton! I scrubbed and scrubbed and then patted myself down with my buff. No room for towels on the trail! Reinvigorated, my next move was food. They have a number you can call and someone from Fontana lodge will come pick you up with a shuttle. For non guests it costs $3. I called the number and 15 minutes later the shuttle was there. They drove me down the road to the lodge. Unfortunately , the lodge restaurant didn’t open until 5 and it was only 3. I needed food, so I walked down from the lodge to a gas station called the Pit Stop. They have some resupply options as well as a small food counter. They sell hot dogs, small pizzas, and nachos. I ordered chili cheese nachos and a pizza, as well as a cherry coke (I wanted a root beer but they didn’t have any). I picked up some more M&Ms (peanut butter), some Reese’s peanut butter cups, two kinds of pop tarts, a Dunkin’ Donuts premixed coffee drink and a banana. I chatted with a couple of hikers while I destroyed the pizza, nachos, cherry coke, banana and coffee. The lady running the store was nice. We joked about a guy who came in complaining about the price of gas when he was driving a mega truck that probably got 5 miles to the gallon. She said she had gone to Vegas the weekend before and hated it. I told her I wasn’t fond of the tourist parts of Vegas either.
The shuttle came and picked me up and dropped me back at the shelter. I had a few hot spots on my feet from all the downhills and I was tired as all get out, but the food, shower, and good company went a long way to making me feel better. The only detail the Fontana Hilton left out was a ladder to the top bunk. There is just one post to step up on. It’s easy to get up but hard to get down gracefully. I already almost fell once. I hope I don’t have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night!!
There were a few more people at the shelter when I got back. Swagman showed up but later left for a hostel. I called Gillian to catch up, and then stood by the fire the other hikers had built and chatted. A southbound thru hiker named Squatch was staying at the shelter! He started the trail back in July. He was a funny guy and told some trail stories. He was hiking with this huge knife and used it to cut up firewood. He said something about hiking in a loincloth. He seemed like he had been in the trail a little too long maybe. He told us he was ready to be done, but glad he did it. 
Tomorrow I plan to zero here (that means rest here and not hike any miles). The weather is going to be nasty and wet, and it would not be wise to go into the Smokies in those conditions. I’m watching the weather Monday. Right now the forecast Monday is better, but not great. Tuesday things clear up a bit, bringing colder temperatures in the 20s and possibly colder. I guess I’ll see! Tomorrow I will rest, eat, tend to my feet, and do laundry near the Pit Stop. It will be good to take a zero!
Despite the wet I enjoyed the trail today and took a picture of some cool vegetation for my photo book. Don’t know what it is - if you do let me know!
I’m grateful for the effort my body has given me thus far, and for the trail always providing what I need, when I need it. I’m grateful to not be thinking about fried chicken anymore, though I am thinking about breakfast at the lodge!
Hungry Cat sleeps.","Brown Fork Gap Shelter 
",Fontana Hilton Shelter,"Mar 10, Sat",12.80
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583946,"I woke at about 8 today. I slept fairly well last night. It rained off and on during the night. It was warmer in the 40s, so I ended up stripping off layers in my 20 degree bag. I like to have a base layer on and then leave a slight gap in the bag so it breathes a bit. It was nice to wake up knowing I wasn’t going to head out into the rain. Ironically, it was only just misting. I brushed my teeth and went back to the shelter to organize my laundry. Today’s plan was simple:  ELW - eat, laundry, weather. The weather forecast changed a bit and it now looked like Monday would bring 4 inches of snow in the smokies, so I started contemplating whether another zero would be a wise call. I tended to the blister on the back of my foot - lanced and drained it, then put some moleskin on it to get me to the village and back. Before hiking with it I will put Leuko tape on it to keep it nice and covered.
A bunch of us were going to the lodge to eat breakfast. While one guy called for the shuttle, I saw a few faces I didn’t recognize and asked if they got in overnight. They said yes, and then one of the guys said “Hungry Cat, I’ve been reading your journal.” I joked with him about how creepy it was because he was sitting back in the shadows on the bottom bunk. In reality, it was really awesome! They were not thru hikers - just guys up for the weekend. I had to leave so didn’t get more details or a name, but figured I would talk with them later at the shelter. The rest of us hopped in the shuttle and went to the lodge to feast. It’s the only real restaurant in Fontana Village. Breakfast was great fun! We talked a lot and I learned a little more about my hiking friends. 4 of them were leaving the shelter  to stay at the lodge tonight. I ate a breakfast burrito, a side of granola, and had a few cups of coffee (Gillian - with cream AND sugar!). It was delicious and filling. 
We went our separate ways after breakfast. A guy named Jay walked with me down to the Pit Stop. I have been calling him Morgan because he hikes with one trekking pole, and in the other hand a wooden hiking stick. It reminds me of this character from the show The Walking Dead. Jay went into the Pit Stop and I walked in to the laundry. There were a few hikers already there, but there was a free washing machine. They didn’t have a change machine or detergent for sale, or any staff, so I walked back to the Pit Stop to get that stuff. When I got back to the laundry I did the best I could to clean everything. I left my shorts on but went shirtless under my rain jacket. I thought about tying my puffy around my naked waist so I could wash my shorts, but I couldn’t figure out how to avoid exposing myself to someone in either end, so I gave up. And hey, I’m a classy guy after all! I popped my coins in and sat down to wait. I didn’t have a phone signal at the lodge or laundry, but I had brought my AWOL guide book to do some planning.  In true hiker trash fashion, I checked around behind the washing machines for a free outlet to charge my electronics. Voila! I plugged them in to charge and starting looking at my next resupply. Gatlinburg was only 3 days away, but I really wanted to try and avoid going there. It’s not that close to the trail, and my Smokies permit is for 8 days. I figured it would take me 6 days to get through the Smokies, assuming the weather doesn’t become a major problem. So, my plan is to hike in with 6 days of supplies and then I have a safety net with Gatlinburg at day 3 - I can make a game time decision. Otherwise, I would look to resupply at Davenport Gap with just enough food to get me over Max Patch and into Hot Springs. That’s the “plan”- ha! Most of my plans so far have required adaptation. The one thing that worries me is ice in the Smokies. I do not have micro spikes and am hoping not to need them. We shall see. It could be really slow going making even 10 mile days gruelingly difficult. I’m assuming that will be the case so that I am mentally prepared. The trail will decide and will provide, so I am not going to worry but I will focus on smart, safe decisions. 
Squatch came into the laundry room when my clothes were almost done drying. He said some of the same things from the night before. Kind of reminded me of myself in that regard! I’m going to be like a parrot when I’m older. He mentioned the need for ice spikes in the Smokies. I don’t know about that, but I know I hope he is wrong for when I get there! I’m sure the hiking will be slow going in the snow, but hopefully not that slick! I walked back to the Pit Stop and got some snacks and a cherry coke. I picked up one more Idahoan mashed potato mix. There - that would keep me safe through the icy Smokies! In case of ice, sprinkle down mashed potato dust. Wait three seconds. Hike on safely!
I walked back up to the lodge to eat lunch. I had a coffee and a blackened chicken sandwich on flatbread. I ordered a Philly cheese steak and fries to go for the shelter. I knew I would be hungry later and didn’t want to cook from my food supply. Plus, this was a good chance to rebuild my strength. I paid my bill and went outside to catch the shuttle, and lucky me, the shuttle was right there waiting!
When I got back to the shuttle there were a bunch of other hikers there. New faces! Cole and his friend were there. I met Sparrows and Ploovey (spelling?). The guy Rivers was making a pair of snowshoes! Yep.... he was the guy who helped relay the lost glove I found back to its owner at NOC. See my photos for a picture of Rivers with one of his homemade snowshoes. I looked for the hikers from this morning who recognized me from this trail journal. They were gone, sadly. BUT, when I climbed up to my top bunk, they had left me trail magic!! They left a little bag with leftover snacks they had. They also included a little note of encouragement with it. Ron and you guys from Rome, GA, thanks for the love! Sorry I didn’t get back from chores in time to chat and grab a photo with you guys. I hope you enjoyed your stay at the Fontana Hilton! Thanks for helping feed this hungry Cat!! People on the trail are just awesome. It’s also nice that those guys were from GA, since I’m not in my home state anymore. 
I chatted a bit with some folks including a guy named Bugler (bugle er). He may be taking the name Tennessee as he wears a Tennessee jacket and isn’t from TN, so it makes for a conversation. I chatted with Gillian since the signal here is good. I finished my take away sandwich and then ate an ice cream sundae flavored pop tart. It’s like I’m 8 again! There was lots of chatter around the shelter, but as I type this we are wrapping things up and winding down. I’m going to make a game time decision tomorrow as to whether I push on. We shall see....
It was awesome to rest and eat and get my clothes clean today. It was super cool to meet someone who had read the journal today, and I am grateful for their kindness and trail magic. Thanks all for the awesome guest book entries! Terry and crew, good luck with q end and all that goes with it! I’m experiencing a different type of “character building now!  Squatch is doing one final performance for the shelter crew before bed :-)
Life is good!","Fontana Hilton Shelter
",Fontana Hilton Shelter,"Mar 11, Sun",0
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583998,"The shelter was packed last night, but I slept fairly well. A lady showed up last night and delivered pizza to the shelter as trail magic. I didn’t catch her name, but she came by again in the morning and I learned that she lives in South Carolina and drives up here once a year to do trail magic. It’s pretty amazing! I wish I had been able to learn more about her. In the morning, Jay ate some fruit and said to me that he get a little weird just accepting trail magic, like he should do something for it. I told him that’s the beauty of it - it’s pure kindness. All you can do is pay it forward. Or, as Ron wrote to me in his note the other day, “magic it forward.” Life On the trail is tough, but somehow there seems to be more generosity and kindness than in many peoples’ “real” lives. I think there is something to be learned from that. 
When I woke up, lots of hikers were bustling about the shelter. It was still dark as the clocks had bumped forward an hour. I quickly checked the forecast from my sleeping bag. Ah, the luxury of modern technology and a cell signal! The day still called for rain and up to 4 inches of snow at higher altitude. That said, I thought strongly about pushing on. I had a text exchange with my wife, and that helped me to make the rational decision to zero today as well. Weather will be cold tomorrow, but at least it won’t be raining (probably won’t be - things change fast in the mountains). You see, this is kind of my M.O. Hungry Cat is like a cat because he likes to be comfortable, likes to eat, and can be lazy. But he’s also like a cat because he gets antsy and curious and can quickly make a series of not-well-thought-out decisions that get him into predicaments. We had a cat named Hallie that passed away shortly before I started my hike. She was the litter runt and weighed all of about 5.5lbs. Even in her old age she looked like a forever kitten. She didn’t know she was tiny though; she would run around and let out these huge roars like some kind of jungle cat. Sometimes I’m like Hallie (minus the forever kitten part). I think I’m a jungle cat, but I’m just an alley cat like the rest. Anyway, I roared a little bit this morning and then decided to zero. Maybe I’ll order some drapes and furniture from Ikea for my corner of the shelter.... A lot of the group headed out into the snow. I heard Motorcycle Mama calling for a shuttle, so I  asked her if she wanted company for breakfast at the lodge. I figured it was a good chance to hear her story. She agreed, so that was the plan. Before catching the shuttle I shoved my water filter into a smart wool sock and then into my down sleeping bag so it wouldn’t freeze, which would render it useless. I brushed my teeth behind the shelter (I’m highlighting this for my dental hygienist supporter who was kind enough to leave a funny post in my guest book the other day - thank you!) and ran into Rivers again. He confessed that he ran out of materials to make a second snowshoe, and so he disassembled the first one. I told him it was still cool that he even made one. It almost looked like some kind of winter mantle piece decoration. He and some others were heading into the mountains this morning.
At breakfast I ordered the breakfast burrito again, but this time had a side of two pancakes. It was all delicious! Motorcycle Mama and I got to know each other a bit. She is from New York and does, in fact, ride a motorcycle (a BMW something - I’m not that versed in types of motorcycles). Turns out she was an accountant for a software company, and just wasn’t feeling that work/lifestyle anymore. So, we had a few things in common. She has a cat named Button and showed me pictures. Button looks a little like our cat Lucy.  We talked a bit about travel experience. She described a trip to Vietnam she’d taken that sounded really cool, and I told her about the years I had spent in China. We discussed some of the characters we’d met in the trail, and overall how we felt about the trail experience so far. I think the common theme was, even on the tough days it beats working! It was really a great conversation and I appreciated the opportunity to get to know a fellow hiker a bit better. So often we just pass each other on the trail with the same chatter - name, thru hiker or not, destination.
After breakfast, Motorcycle Mama went up to her room at the lodge. I wanted to charge my phone and journal a bit in the lobby, hiker trash style. I was wearing my hiking pants, but I had my green crocs on with no socks. I take every opportunity to air out my feet, and I wanted the blister on my right foot to dry up a bit. The lodge lobby had free coffee, so I settled in. There was a conference at the lodge and a lady from the conference approached me at the coffee machine. She asked if I was a hiker and said that she had forgotten how close this lodge was to the trail. She said she thought it was a great accomplishment that I would hike to Maine. All I could think was that I was just hoping to survive tomorrow! I don’t think about Maine. I really don’t. I take one day at a time and basically just try to make the next best decision I can and put one foot in front of the other without hurting myself. 
I plopped down in the lobby and chatted with some hikers - Traveler from New Zealand was there. I found out that he lives in London now. He’s been living in the UK for a while. I found an outlet and plugged in to charge my phone and journal a bit. I knew I needed to go back to the shelter at some point, but it was quite cold out so I wasn’t in a hurry. The only thing I wished I had done was bring my water filter. I always worry about it freezing without my body heat. I drank some more free coffee. It made me jumpy! I drank lots of coffee prior to hitting the trail. It was a habit I developed while working long and odd hours. On the trail the most I’ve had is two Via packets per day in the morning. I think this was my fifth cup, so I definitely felt a little twitchy. It was nice to be in a warm lodge with comfortable furniture, free hot drinks, a restaurant, and views of the falling snow. The tree tops far away in the mountains were dusted like a Christmas scene. As I sat and journaled, I saw two girls, Pocket Doc and Toad, who were at the shelter this morning and I had thought set out hiking. I found out that they got 3 miles in and Toad’s ankle/Achilles was hurting badly, so they turned back to get s night of rest at the lodge. I felt badly for her as the first 3-4 miles are the meat of the climb into the Smokies, and also of course because she was hurt. They said that there were a ton of hikers who pushed on today. They were in a bubble of about 30. I was surprised, figuring most would zero and head out tomorrow. I do think there will be a large bubble tomorrow as well, which is ok.
Since I have the time, I’ll finish the story of the Hiawassee Magic. I already wrote about meeting Louise and Miss Ellie, and about going back for my puffy jacket at the restaurant. This piece of magic is perhaps the strangest. That night after dinner when I was unpacking and organizing my bag, I found something on the bed spread at the Budget Inn. At the time I thought it had fallen out of my ditty bag (what’s a ditty bag? See my videos to find out.). The bed spread was very mottled with many colors, typical of a slightly dated motel pattern. On it was a small tan rock. It was about the size of my thumbnail and was shaped like a heart. On one side it had a heart drawn on it in green marker, and on the other it had a capital “G,” also in green marker. You can see a picture of it in my photos. I was convinced my wife Gillian had put it in my ditty bag, so I texted her. She had not! Then I was convinced my parents had done it, but they had not either! I felt a little crazy, and in a way I felt like I’d just barely missed Santa coming down the chimney. The only thing I could figure out was that maybe someone else had accidentally left this rock on the bedspread, and I had found it. The coincidence of the “G” was a bit uncanny though. I took a picture of the rock and told Gillian that I wasn’t going to carry the weight, but would take the picture instead. However, I did actually decide that the rock, weight or not, should come with me to Maine, and so I vowed to bring it with me and give it to Gillian after the journey as a surprise. I thought I put it in my ditty bag. A few days later when I checked my bag, the rock was not there. Now, I don’t know if you believe in magic, but this was so odd! The rock was kind of exactly what I needed, mentally, when I needed it to get me going again. If I didn’t have a picture of it, I could almost believe it was a conjuring of my mind. I wish I had the rock to give to Gillian, but most things magic require an element of ephemerality to be magical, and I suppose this was no different. I can even see the next hiker finding that rock. Maybe it would even have a different letter on it - whatever letter that hiker needs to see. Regardless, at that moment I knew just how special the trail was, and that if I could always remember the magic of that rock, I would never lose my way. Not on the trail; not anywhere.
I waited until my electronics were fully charged. I went back to the lodge restaurant and ordered a taco salad to go. I know you’re probably thinking “what?? A salad?!” Well, I needed veggies and protein. It had chicken in it, and it also came in a taco salad shell that I could eat for carbs/calories. As I was waiting for the food, Dicey walked up. I barely recognized her all cleaned up. She got food to go back to her room. We chatted a bit and she said she was staying at the lodge and then hitting the trail tomorrow. Somehow it made me feel better to know we would head out on the same day. She had a lot of knowledge and confidence in the woods. I know she wouldn’t walk out into certain death! I ducked aboard the shuttle with my food and had an entire conversation about chainsaws with the shuttle driver.
There were some new faces and old faces at the shelter. Squatch was gone. Maverick and his son Goober (I met them at the Pit Stop the first day here) are staying tonight, as well as some section hikers and Sparrows. I wanted to shower. In fact, I had planned to shower back at the lodge. I don’t have a towel and I just washed my buff, so I didn’t want to lay down with that and have my wet buff freeze. So, in true hobo fashion, I went into the lodge bathroom and came out looking my fat like Santa, my jacket pockets full of paper towels so I could pat down later. Like I said, I’m a classy guy.
I walked up to the bathroom and there was a maintenance crew working, so I went back to the shelter and ate my salad. It was good! I swept up the shelter floor to get some of the detritus out. Most shelters have a broom. Then I put in some socks and tucked into my sleeping bag to wait for a bit to take a shelter. Some of the shelter folks from last night had left some food behind, so I grabbed a ramen for tonight. That and the trail magic snacks from yesterday will make a nice dinner!
I finally went up and took a shower. It felt glorious. I can’t see to quite get rid of the hiker funk though. It’s like my pits have this memory of stench, and 5 minutes after the shower they remember “oh yeah, I supposed to smell like dead squirrel toes. Let me get on that.” Anyway, when I finally done with this adventure I think I’ll have to shave off all my body hair and soak in vinegar for a few hours.
I went back to the shelter and talked more with other hikers and ate an orange from some morning trail magic. It was good to eat citrus. Everyone is talking about the Smokies. We don’t know what to expect from the hiking. We know it will be cold, but we don’t know if the trail will be icy and dangerous, or just manageable and slow going. I’ve been at this juncture with whitewater kayaking before. Getting ready for the next big challenge, then thinking more about the potential consequences than focusing on the fact that I’m prepared and ready. It becomes kind of a self-defeating psych out. So I’m going to stop thinking about it and just wake up in the morning and hike! It will be good, and we should have great views. 
In his book “AWOL on the Appalachian Trail,” David Miller wrote: “Anything that we consider to be an accomplishment takes effort to achieve. If it were easy, it would not be nearly as gratifying. What is hardship at the moment will add to our sense of achievement in the end.” I’m glad the Smokies will be a challenge. It will make me feel alive. 
I’m going to rest a bit and make ramen later. Tomorrow I plan to eat a cold breakfast on the go. I’ve been antsy today eating and resting. Tomorrow it’s time to hike!","Fontana Hilton Shelter

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584082,"Holy mother of the earth it’s cold!
I woke up at the Hilton to some early birds getting their gear ready to go. I had resolved not to hike until the sun was up, but I got up to use the bathroom and catch the sunrise. It was gorgeous! I ate a cold breakfast so I could get moving. The Fontana Hilton has been good to me. I had almost become “mama Hilton” staying there two nights. I started looking at IKEA for furniture and drapes, maybe some throw pillows. Oh well, time to move on. 
The trail from the Hilton to the Dam is basically the road. I walked along quietly, enjoying some early sun. I taped up the blister on my right heel pretty good with Leuko tape and a piece of moleskin on top of that. It was still sore though and I walked a bit tenderly. The trail crosses directly over the dam, and I was blessed with a beautiful view. I felt even better about my decision not to push on yesterday as I took a photo. As I crossed the dam I caught up to Dicey and we chatted a bit. I found out that she had attempted a thru hike before, but had broken her foot in PA. Bummer! This is her redemption thru hike. We hiked to where the trail heads into the woods and into the Great Smokey Mountain National Park. There is a box for thru hiker permits, so I dropped mine inside and started the climb.
The initial climb wasn’t really that bad. It seemed easier than the climb out of NOC. I soon stripped down to just my base layer and used my gloves, buff, and hat to regulate my body temperature. My buff is so versatile for this! I started wearing it like a balaclava, then just over the top of my head, and then around my head and ears like a headband to let more heat out of the top of my head. It’s my favorite piece of gear!!! 
As I climbed higher and the trail started to plateau off a bit, I started seeing snow on the ground. And then more. And then more. At times the snow was 3-4 inches deep in the trail. Piles of snow off the trail were 12 inches deep. I trudged on. It wasn’t difficult hiking; it wasn’t ice. The surrounding forest looked like a Christmas card; it was a real winter wonderland! 
I hiked past a girl of college age and she started hiking behind me. I asked her if she wanted to pass, but she opted to walk behind me. We started chatting and ended up having a nice little hiking chat-a-thon. It was the first time I’d really walked and talked with someone for more than two minutes. Her name was Elizabeth and she goes to school in Dahlonega, Ga. Her father had thru hiked before, and now she was doing it. It’s pretty cool to see people in their early 20s getting out here and doing this. I wouldn’t have even thought of it back then. 
We hiked along and got to the first shelter in no time. A couple named Midnight and Buttercup, and their dog BooBoo were there. Midnight and Buttercup are an interesting pair. I first met them in the laundry room at Fontana Village. They were clearly stoned, and as I walked up on them at Mollies Ridge shelter, they were smoking pot. I’m not judging at all, just recording history as it happened. They said the water source there was good, which was awesome because I needed to refill. Midnight also told me the trail to the water was compacted and icy, so to take a trekking pole. I appreciated the heads up. I got a full two liters of water. 
When we stopped Elizabeth and I both decide to push 3 more miles to the next shelter, Russell Field. It took me a bit to get water, and when I came back they were already on the trail ahead of me. I soon caught up to Midnight and Buttercup, and of course BooBoo. From what I’ve heard, BooBoo was a litter runt used by people who conduct dog fights. They put him in a cage to rile up the fighting dogs, who would bite him. I guess Midnight and a friend came upon this scene and used a bit of muscle and cunning to take BooBoo away. He’s been with them ever since. Also, Midnight is a vet and I get the feeling he’s been through some horrible stuff, and BooBoo is his service dog. Anyway, they are super nice and try and help people on the trail. 
We all ended up at the next shelter. Then other folks started filtering in. RTK, Maverick and Goober. A whole crowd of spring breakers showed up. Elizabeth and I were first to the shelter, so we at least had “seniority.” In the Smokies, section hikers who want to stay at shelters have to reserve them. Thru hikers can stay, but have to yield the shelters to section hikers.  
I sat and ate. I had a mountain house chicken meal, then a tuna packet. Then I ate two packets of granola and a bag of peanut butter M&Ms. I had a cup of ginger turmeric tea, then went ahead and brushed my teeth. 
We talked with some of the section hikers and college students. Most were from Florida. Midnight gave us a little piece of starter log and we got a small fire going. This shelter had a nice fireplace and it was tarped off from the wind. After it got dark, it was time to get in the sleeping bag! 
I’m tired but I feel good. I’m grateful that the weather was so good today, and for the good companionship from various hikers today. I’m lucky to be warm in my sleeping bag. The low tonight is supposed to be about 9, so it will be a cold one. Time for this Hungry Cat to burrow into his sleeping bag!","Fontana Hilton Shelter

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584300,"**i will back post the next few days later. Here’s where I left off before I lost signal.I woke up early and had to pee. Ugh! It was still dark out. I somehow convinced myself I didn’t have to go. I nodded back to sleep, but slept lightly. I woke up again at around 7 and heard others moving in their bags, so decided to get up and going. Goober was sound asleep next to me. He’s a tall, lanky, 19 year old kid with not an ounce of body fat. He probably needs food more than I do! He and I joke about our food consumption a lot. I asked him what he wants to do after the trail and, while not sure, he has considered the military. He’s a good kid and I quite enjoy chatting with him and his dad, Maverick. I creeped out of my bag trying not to hit my head. I chose the bottom level of the shelter where the ceiling was so low you could barely sit up. I don’t like climbing down from the top at night if I have to go to the bathroom. The fire the night before had dried my boots. I ran out behind the shelter to pee, and then grabbed my food bag off of the bear cables. I went inside to get my gear to cook breakfast and noticed one of the college kids was sleeping in the dirt below where we all hung our bags. I realized it was the kid who we had seen sleeping in a hammock when we got into the shelter. He had taken his hammock down at night and come inside because it was so cold. We kind of figured that would happen. He had no tarp, no bottom quilt. Most of those kids were not prepared for the cold. If I were that school, I probably would have insisted on checking their gear. I felt a little bad for the trip coordinator who was trying to keep them alive. She cooked and provided all of their meals for them! I saw her handing out those hand warmer packets a lot. It sort of reminded me of how animals in the wild teach their young. I was staying with a nest of baby birds!
I cooked up a hot breakfast of coffee and oatmeal, then got dressed to hike (e.g. peeled layers). I was the last thru hiker out of the shelter. The others skipped breakfast. Sometimes I skip it too, but I wanted it today. Temps were in the teens and it was snowing lightly. I said bye to the college kids and hit the trail. As an aside, one of the kids looked and sounded like Tom Schwartz from the show “Vanderpump Rules,” not that I’m admitting to watching that. If I did watch it, I’d probably say his mannerisms were super similar as well. Based on what I’ve heard, of course.
I hiked fast at first to warm up my hands and toes. The most painful part of the morning is before the extremities get warm. I clutched my hiking poles under my left armpit and jammed my hands in my pockets to get them started. That helped tremendously, and after 3-5 minutes they were toasty and I put them back in my gloves.
The morning hiking was full of snow and the views were largely whiteout. It wasn’t until close to midday that the snow stopped and we started to see the sun. I passed a few hikers here and there, including Elizabeth and RTK. I arrived at a shelter thinking I was only a mile or so away as there were two in close proximity. I saw some spring break hikers from Tampa that were at the same shelter last night. They were having lunch. I quickly realized this was not the shelter I thought and that I still had six or seven miles to go.   It’s never great when you feel like you should be somewhere and you still have hours to go. I ran down a side trail and filtered some water, then decided I needed some protein as I was feeling low on fuel. Womp! My tuna pack was frozen solid. I tucked it in my pocket to warm it as I hiked and pushed on. The hiking got more difficult. There were lots of patches of compressed snow and ice. Although the climbs weren’t long, they were quite steep, as were some of the downhills. All of these factors made for slow, exhausting climbing. 
I could feel a hot spot on one of the toes on my left foot and resolved to check it at my next break. I would forget to do that.... I finally came to Silers Bald Shelter, which was the shelter before my goal. I saw a hiker named Scars there. He was eating some tuna and told me his kidneys were hurting. Scars said he thought he was dehydrated but that he was going to drink water. I asked if he had any preexisting conditions, had ever felt this before, whether he had had enough to eat and drink, if he’d filtered his water, etc. None of these threads panned out. I thought maybe it could be kidney stones, or perhaps a UTI, though that would be a bit weird for a guy. He said he would rest and see how he felt. I told him that there were a bunch of thru hikers behind me headed for his shelter, but that he should share this info with them in case someone had a medical background, or at least so they would know. I knew RTK and a guy called Diablo were going there, as well as a few others. I hoped he would be ok and figured I would find out via trail mail tomorrow.
I pushed on. The views on the back side of Siler’s Bald were stunning! I climbed up and down and finally made it to Double Spring Gap Shelter around 5pm. It was full except for a few spots, but I knew the guys from Florida were on their way. A guy named Sauerkraut strung his hammock and I pitched my tent. It was freezing! I tried to work fast getting the tent set up, but my numb fingers struggled to cooperate. I finally got it erected and starting getting organized. First, camp clothes, second, water, third, food.... I couldn’t completely get into camp clothes because my feet were wet. I didn’t want to put on dry socks with my crocs because the snow on the ground was thick. So, I had to wear my wet socks and boots until I was ready to lay down for the night. Not the most comfortable as my toes were numb, but I knew I would eat soon and that would make me feel better. I started walking down to get water and I saw the Florida guys passing on. They asked if I wanted one of their spots in the shelter. I thanked them, but my tent was already up so I figured I should just stick with things as they were. 
The water was cold, but not nearly as cold as my fingers handling it. The sun was starting to go down so temperatures were quickly dropping. It was probably about 20 degrees. I tried to filter water quickly as I didn’t want my filter to freeze. I filtered two liters and quickly jammed the filter into my fleece pocket. I poured some water to boil and shoved the water bottles inside my jacket so they wouldn’t freeze. Ice had already begun to form a thin layer around the inside of the bottles. Tonight, I was going to feast on sour cream and chives flavored Idahoan potatoes, the dinner of champions! I was very excited about this as I had been hungry all day. I put a punch of TVP (textured vegetable protein) in as well to help make it more filling. It was delicious! My eyes rolled into the back of my head while I ate it, and I forgot momentarily about my frozen toes. The shelter was full, but I was eating alone outside because it was so cold. I didn’t blame any of them - it was time to be in a sleeping bag! I made some food noises so people would know I was having something delightful, and because eating had made me happy. I don’t know why; sometimes a chorus of “nom nom nom” is just satisfying. 
The temperature was expected to fall to single digits, with a windchill below zero. My tent would block the wind, thank goodness. After I ate I tried to rinse the mashed potatoes out of my cookpot, but the water just froze inside the pot. I gave up and just threw the pot in my food bag to hang for the night. I went back to my tent and set about getting my boots off and getting ready to sleep. When I took my boots off, I remembered I had to deal with my hot spot. Well, it may have been a hot spot at one point, but it was a full-blown blister on the inside of the toe next to my big toe now. I got out my knife, hand sanitizer, and a tissue. I sanitized everything and then lanced it. I put a bandaid around it for the night; I would tape it in the morning. I then proceeded to put on every piece of clothing I had! I tried to journal but it was too cold to have the sleeping bag open enough to type with my fingers, so I gave up and decided to go to bed and finish journaling tomorrow. I didn’t have a cell signal anyway (this would become a theme in the Smokies at the shelters). 
It was a wonderful, long day of hiking rewarded by some amazing views. I’m grateful we had snow and not rain, even though some of the trail was slippery. A few of the drifts I saw were about three feet deep! It was a good day and Hungry Cat was definitely hungry. Today I hiked from an elevation of 4,347 feet to 5,509 feet. Tomorrow I will climb the highest peak on the entire Appalachian Trail: Clingman’s Dome At 6,658 feet. Shortly after that I will descend to Mt. Love and hit my 200 mile mark on the trail. Tomorrow is going to be a big day!
Postscripts:
#1 the hiker I referred to as Elizabeth yesterday is actually named Heather. I don’t know where I got Elizabeth from. Her trail name is Nightmare because she used to tickle her friends’ feet to get them out of bed in the morning when they would sleep in at shelters. They said she was a nightmare. 
#2 Jason, not weird to ask about pooping at all! I’m sure a lot of people wonder about that. I have a write up I’m doing on trail hygiene and I will include the art of le poo in that, which will answer your question. Saving that for a day when I’m too tired to write much ;-).
#3 Shawn, that’s awesome that you are interested in doing trail magic! I polled the group at the shelter tonight and we all agreed that the following are good choices:

Beverages like hot cocoa
Snickers bars or M&Ms
For the ambitious, hot dogs or something on a portable grill. I had hot dogs at Tellico Gap!
Jugs of water for people to refill water bottles so they don’t have to go to the creek and filter water. Extra bonus for electrolyte tabs!
Just having a garbage bag where people can dump garbage is really cool. I love finding garbage cans and ditching that weight/clutter. 
Sodas is another idea. No need to go diet!
Lastly, in lieu of hot food, you could make mini trail tacos with tortillas, cheese and pepperoni or something like that. I might just be hungry on this one though....

Whatever you do, it’s best not to have community bags of food to where hikers would all be reaching their hands in it. That can get people sick. And any gesture, no matter how small, is always appreciated! Have fun on your camping trip and thanks for asking! I’m glad you Ike the journal. It is not easy to keep it up and cell phone signals often disappoint and I have to back post, but I’m in it for the long haul! If I don’t post for a few days it’s because I don’t have a signal at night, or i a just too tired (will happen sometimes), or I have run out of battery. Most likely culprit is cell signal. I type the entries into notepad and then upload later. Typing these things with my thumbs is exhausting. Dictation can work, but not at shelters or where others would be disturbed. Hope q end is going ok!
#4 Beaker’s Biggest Fan - yes it is safe for single women to hike the AT. There are a lot of single women hiking and the trail community is huge. It is generally incredibly safe out here (in terms of the people on the trail). The same precautions generally apply - but it’s easy to be around other hikers, including when hitching rides into town, etc. Ladies, get out and do it!!","Russell Field Shelter
",Double Spring Gap Shelter ,"Mar 14, Wed",16.40
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584369,"I woke up early at about 5:30 and had to pee. Sensing a theme?  It was dark and freezing out and quite gusty, so I convinced myself I didn’t have to go that badly and tried to go back to sleep. I tossed and turned for about an hour, and woke up again. This time I really had to go. I figured I would get up, pee, and then run get my food bag off the bear cables and have breakfast in bag. I scrambled out of my bag about to burst. My camp shoes were still in my bag, so I had to wear my boots. I went to put them on and they were frozen! I mean frozen solid. The snow the day before had gotten them wet and I had nowhere to keep them warm. I tried to jam my feet into them but could not. Gah! I had to go to the bathroom so badly!! I decided to jam my toes into them and walk tiptoe like a ballerina. I opened the tent fly and the wind blew a wave of ice in my face. I felt like I wasn’t going to make it. “You’ve got this,” I told myself. I went to get up and staggered around like a drunken sailor, needing to brace myself by grabbing the ground with my left hand. And in that moment, with all that going on, I felt a little trickle down my leg. Yep, I peed myself. I was able to stop the stream, but I immediately yanked open my pants there beside my tent and the trail and let the rest flow. Slightly humiliated, but also not caring because it was single digits cold, I ballerina stepped my way to the food bags, and then returned and dove back into my tent. Well, that went well, didn’t it? This is hiker life. 
I proceeded to make breakfast in bag. I decided to eat more this morning because I felt tired and hungry the day before when hiking. I started with two packs of oatmeal that I ate cold. Then I cooked some ramen in the cookpot that still had the frozen mashed potato residue from the night before. I added some TVP to it for substance. Delicious! I skipped coffee since my cookpot was dirty. I had set my boots next to my stove while cooking, and that appeared to help make them a little more pliable. I set about wrapping my blister with leuko tape and packing up my things. I washed my cookpot and filtered more water. Sauerkraut was making his breakfast while I filtered water. I disassembled my tent carefully in the gusty wind, trying not to lose any of it over the mountain. Ice was on everything. My cookpot was clean but it froze in about 5 seconds. My tarp and tent fly were icy. I put those in the outer mesh pocket of my bag to dry. It was time to hike!
The day was clear and blustery. The climb up to Clingman’s Dome was gorgeous. The forest had been transitioning a bit as we got higher up and was now filled with Douglas and Frazier firs, as well as Cedars. It was truly spectacular. One minute I would be high on a ridge, and the next I would descend into a dark, thick coniferous forest. There was a little side trail up to the tower at Clingman’s, so I took that, and there it was! It was weird. It wasn’t like a normal fire tower. It had a concrete spiral ramp that went up to a round concrete viewing tower. It kind of looked like an alien spacecraft. The view at the top provided 365 degrees of the surrounding mountaintops, looking out over frosted balds and conifers. I didn’t stay long as the wind was quite powerful up there, almost blowing me over as I headed back down.
From Clingman’s I descended to Mt. Love, which marks the 200 mile point on my AT journey. That was pretty cool. The trail dropped down and down and down. It got more slippery as the sun came out and started melting the top layer of snow. It was supposed to warm up today to potentially 44 degrees. I used my trekking poles to work my way down, slipping and sliding. Lots of day hikers started appearing, making the trek up to Clingman’s. Then, I saw my first Ridge Runner! They are employed my the Appalachian Trail Conservancy to help protect the trail and make sure shelters are being used properly. In the Smokies, they also check for permits. Her name was Christine and I asked her a bit about her job. She was handling one stretch between Fontana and Newfound Gap. She had a uniform on that sort of looked like a scout leader uniform. She asked about my permit, but when she found out it was in my bag inside a stuff sack, she let it go. I had asked her for a photo for my journal and she said most people who didn’t have a permit wouldn’t ask for a photo. Good point! I told her I wanted to dry some gear off and she informed me that before Newfound Gap there was a parking lot with lots of sun and no cars. I trekked on through the Christmas scene forest. I started to pass a lot of day hikers, each asking me how much farther Clingman’s Dome was. 
When I got to the lot, I pulled out my sleeping bag, tarp, footprint, and laid them all out to dry. I had to place things on them so they wouldn’t blow away. As I sat down to look through my food bag for some tuna, a group of kids and two adults walked up. It was an outdoor school for the kids and they were on a field excursion. The school was in a place called “Tremont,” but I am not sure where that is. One of the teachers came over and asked me where I was hiking to. I told her I was going to Maine. The kids got a little excited by that. She was really cool and asked why I decided to do it. Then, she gave me an entire bag of leftover food that she had packed for the kids! She said they were leaving and I could have it. There was a big thick sandwich with cheese, turkey, lettuce, and tomato. There were several slices of cheese, and a whole bunch of fig newton cookies. It was incredible. She said her name was Jen and she was from Akron, OH. I am forever grateful to you, Jen from Akron! That snack was exactly the boost I needed when I needed it. I took a picture with her and she headed off. I immediately demolished the sandwich and a handful of fig newtons and saved the rest for later.  Actual cheese!!!!
I gathered up my gear while a family who had walked over lurked about. I couldn’t tell what they were doing. Had I become a freak show? Probably. I’m sure I looked a little odd with my gear all over the place, all dirty and smelly. I trekked on, determined to get to the shelter with time to do camp chores.
The trail to Newfound Gap was muddy and slick - just a harbinger of what was to come. When I got to the gap, it was a zoo of tourists. I guess this is a big tourist destination as it is on the NC/TN border and also in the Smokies. I helped a family take a photo by the NC/TN border sign, and then they returned the favor. 
I was excited to dump all of my trash in the trash bin at the parking lot. I saw the sign for bathrooms and went in to wash up, only to find they didn’t have a sink or mirrors, only hand sanitizer. I was hoping to wash up a bit, but alas.
The climb out of Newfound Gap was nasty. First, the trail was covered in mud. Tourist traffic here had really done a number on it. Then, it was covered in large patches of ice. It was tricky to get through these, and honestly, I couldn’t believe some people were trying to walk in this in flats and tennis shoes. Thus far on the trail I was surprised I hadn’t fallen. I’ve slipped many times but have always been able to catch myself with my trekking poles. Today that streak would end. I had just skated past two girls on the trail when whoop! My legs went out from under me sideways. I tried to brace with my poles to no avail. It wasn’t a bad fall, and I quickly got up before anyone could see. If no one sees, does it count? 
On the way up the trail I noticed consistent spots of blood on the ground. It was steady, every few feet. I kept walking and the trail of blood kept going. I thought maybe it was someone’s dog, but dogs aren’t allowed in the Smokies, and there were no paw prints. The longer it continued, the more I expected to see a body around each turn. It was mysterious and disturbing! I couldn’t stop following it though, and the spots were every four to five feet. What happened?! I followed on as I hiked up, theories swirling in my head.
The rest of the trail into the shelter was more of the same: slipping, sliding and sloshing. When I got to the shelter there were still 3-4 spaces left - sweet! It was about 5 o’clock, so I figured I’d be good and unpacked my bed roll and sleeping bag, then set about getting water and making dinner. The shelter had a beautiful view off the side of the mountain. It’s supposed to be warmer tonight too, which will be nice. Nightmare (Heather), Diablo, Rivers and a few others are at the shelter. I followed the trail of blood all the way to the shelter to one spot. At the shelter everyone was talking about the mysterious trail of blood! We figured that someone had actually cut or injured himself at the shelter, and then walked bleeding all the way down to Newfound Gap. I hope that person is ok! Every single hiker group I’ve run into since then also talks about the blood trail! It was breaking news on the trail - a real Angela Lansbury special.
I’m grateful for the trail magic from Akron Jen today, and for all of the amazing vistas I got to see. I’m thankful I made it to camp safely, and that the trail of blood did not lead to a body. I have no cell signal here so not sure what the weather holds for tomorrow. Good night!","Double Spring Gap Shelter

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584370,"It got a little colder overnight than I expected. It was hard to get out of bed in the morning. Of course I had to pee though! I wanted to get an early start as I was considering hiking 20+ miles to better position me for a shorter hike to resupply the next day. The wind was blowing fiercely in powerful gusts outside. I wanted to make breakfast, but didn’t want to deal with the wind, so I figured I would hit the trail early and then find a little spot to pull over in a mile or so to have a hot breakfast. That would not come to fruition.... I grabbed my food bag off the bear cables and hit the trail. 
I was first out of the shelter. The trail that was somewhat icy yesterday had frozen over night. It was now almost solid ice. I crept along carefully. As I picked and slipped my way down, getting creative with my trekking poles and using the sides of the trail, I reasoned that it was only this bad because we were still kind of close to Newfound Gap. Once I got a little farther, surely the trail quality would improve. Wrong! For the first 2-3 miles the trail was basically a giant ice luge to hell! Don’t get me wrong, it was pretty, but the hiking was intense and exhausting. I was determined not to get injured and crept along like a turtle on crutches, flailing about with my trekking poles and sometimes needing to climb off trail through snow drifts where spots were particularly bad. Rivers bounded past me in the first mile, saying he was thankful for growing up in Michigan. I didn’t get that kind of ice-hopping pedigree in Georgia!
Just when I thought the ice was easing up, it came back. This time it was icy where the trail crept along a steep ridge line. A fall here could be very, very bad. I took a small step, planted a trekking pole - ok. I was stable. I took another step, wobbled a little and jammed my trekking pole into the ground. The hiking was like this for a while, but I didn’t fall. I was incredibly nervous though, and could picture people finding my body, gnawed on by coyotes at the bottom of the mountain. I finally came to a patch of dry ground and saw a sign for a side trail to Charlie’s Bunion. It had a warning that parents should keep small kids close, so of course I wanted to check it out. As I went to it I heard a loud yell. Oh boy! I could picture seeing Rivers hurtling through the sky. I dropped my pack and took my trekking poles with me. When I arrived at poor Charlie’s Bunion, I saw three day hikers from University of Central Florida. They had a done a Garden State-esque (referencing the film) yell into the abyss of the Bunion. It was basically a large rock outcrop with a glorious panoramic view of the surrounding mountains. It was breathtaking! I climbed up the Bunion and took a few pictures, and also helped the UCF kids take a photo. They returned the favor. 
I got back on the AT and hiked on. The hiking was exhausting. As the temperature rose into the 40s, the ice softened in places, but forward progress was slow. I was constantly slipping on slush or ice, but I never fell! That kind of hiking is incredibly tough though, and my left Achilles was getting sore. Muscles that normally wouldn’t hurt ached, including my back, from all of the twisting and fighting with the ice and snow. The views, on the other hand, were spectacular! After Charlie’s Bunion I climbed Mt. Sequoyah and the east ridge of Mt. Chapman. All along the way the trail revealed vistas on both sides of the trail. I took so many pictures that after a while I just stopped and enjoyed the views privately as I walked. The first part of the Smokies before Newfound Gap did not have quite as any views like this. I was in awe. 
I was also pretty destroyed when I finally got to the shelter! My body ached and I was starving. Because of the ice I never stopped for breakfast. I ate fig newtons and cliff bars along the way. There was a Ridge Runner named Chloe at the shelter. Her trail name was Vulture. Apparently she had thru hiked before with a hat with a crazy picture of a vulture on it. Funny how that happens.... She told us that there were 10 reservations for the shelter that night, but that those folks might not show up. I contemplated pushing on to Cosby Knob Shelter, but the thought of 7 more miles was tough to swallow. I knew it was supposed to rain tomorrow. I really wanted to resupply midday. The only way to do that was to hike 7 more miles today. However, the hiking was so tough today I knew in my heart I shouldn’t do it. I filtered some water, and after eating a tuna pack, 8 fig newtons and an oatmeal packet, I decided to stay. I showed Chloe my permit (she was checking), and then set down my bedding. I was one of the early arrivals and so I knew I would have shelter space - it was definitely good to have a bird in the hand. 
I set about getting cleaned up a bit. I washed my hands and redoctored the blister on my left foot. I went back out and ate a ton more food, including a Knorr rice side. I had two cups of tea since it was only just 5, and chatted with the Ridge Runner a bit. She was from Asheville and got this job after first volunteering for a while. She was really nice. Nightmare, Diablo, Rivers and his tramily (trail family), Sauerkraut, and even Swagman showed up. An older gentleman with a bushy grey beard named Finnigan was at the shelter. He is thru hiking. He said his wife is busy with her job and he needed something to do! Unfortunately, Finnigan was not prepared for the cold in the Smokies and had sustained some nasty frostbite on in of his hands. I felt bad for him.  He seemed in good spirits though!
I hung my food bag, used the privy, and then got in my bag to journal. An older couple sleeping above me have a twin sleeping bag! They both sleep inside it like sardines. It’s cute! I move around so much in my sleep I would probably drive Gillian nuts if we did that!
I’m grateful that I just made it through today in one piece, and very appreciative of and awestruck by the incredible views I saw today. My higher power on the trail helped me to realize I needed to stop today, and I’m glad I had the sense to take the cues and rest at the shelter. It will serve me well tomorrow when the rain comes!","Icewater Spring Shelter
",Tri-Corner Knob Shelter,"Mar 16, Fri",12.60
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584372,"I woke up at 7am having slept well in the shelter. I usually do not sleep well in shelters, but somehow I did. People were already bustling about, so I got up and immediately noticed that, while cold, it was definitely above freezing outside. Sweet! It was St. Patrick’s Day, and just as he drove the snakes out of Ireland, he was running with us hikers to get the heck out of the snow and slush of the higher altitudes of the Smokies.
I expected rain so I got my gear ready and put on my rain pants and jacket. Nightmare said one of the guys had a bad blister but had run out of tape, so I took a look at it and helped him tape it up with Leuko tape and moleskin. Out here on the trail we have to look out for each other. Answers to problems aren’t always as simple and convenient as they might be in “regular” life. Small problems can become big problems quickly. Hikers tend to be pretty good about watching out for one another. Should be a lesson for regular life really. After I got him sorted, I set about making breakfast. I boiled water for coffee and ate my two packs of oatmeal. There was a leftover plastic bottle in the shelter and no one claimed it, so I asked the Ridge Runner Chloe if it was hers. She said no, so I packed it out figuring I could get rid of it when I resupplied. Because I did this, Chloe gave me this AT trail karma necklace! The idea is that the trail is what we all make it - we all have a responsibility  to fight for it, leave no trace, and help keep it clean. She gave me the necklace, and now when I see someone picking up trash off the trail or doing a similar deed, I can pass it off to that person. I LOVE it! 
I headed out to hike and already felt relieved. My plan was to hike to Davenport Gap, which marks the northern boundary of the Great Smokey Mountains National Park, and then a few more miles to Standing Bear hostel to resupply with enough food to get to Hot Springs. I didn’t want to stay at the hostel, but planned to continue on the trail and find a place to camp. The nice thing about being out of the Smokies is that I didn’t have to stay at shelters anymore, which was a requirement in the park. 
I headed out into the morning and it still wasn’t raining. The trail was slush and slippery, but I scampered along. It started raining about 30 minutes in, but rather than just out on my rain gear, I decided to put on shorts and a t shirt and wear those under my rain gear, instead of the long sleeve smart wool shirt and pants I had on. I knew I would be hiking about 20 miles today, and while it was still chilly I could feel it warming up. I pulled over on the trail and stripped naked. It was awkward because I was trying not to get multiple things wet. I was balancing on a log above the snow, sort of like Daniel-San doing the crane kick in The Karate Kid (one of the best films ever!), only instead of the crane kick I was holding my underwear and digging through my dry sack for my shorts. I had to work fast as there was an older couple not too far behind. I finally got myself sorted and resumed trekking. I was a little chilly at first, but warmed up quickly. After about another hour, the rain stopped and the sun came out. I noticed less slush and more mud on the trail. It really felt like spring!
The warmth and glow of the sun felt rejuvenating. My happiness meter skyrocketed to a million percent! The trail rose up and along ridge lines with pretty views, and then descended down towards Cosby Knob Shelter. Just past the shelter I ran into a hiker from Connecticut called Finger Foods. He’s a big guy at about 6’4”. He got his trail name because for the first week he had forgotten a utensil to eat with so he had to eat everything with his fingers.
I stopped and talked with him while we both filtered water at a small stream. Rivers and another hiker walked by. Everyone was ecstatic about the weather. The rain was quite light in the morning and it didn’t seem like it would rain again until after dark. 
I carried on down to Low Gap, and then began the climb up Mt. Cammerer. Just before the summit I saw a huge Doe right off the trail. She was aware of me, but decided I was ok. I stayed still as she came a little closer, then snapped a picture. It was awesome! Then she moved on and so did I. 
After Mt. Cammerer the trail started a long descent into Davenport Gap. I actually had a decent cell signal, whereas I did not in the rest of the Smokies. I uploaded some photos and a journal entry and gave Gillian a ring to let her know I was alive, see how she was doing, and relay a few adventures. At Davenport Gap I saw Swagman. He said his feet were killing him, but he was going to push on to Standing Bear hostel. I pushed on as well. 
After Davenport Gap there was a bit of a climb, and then the trail dropped into a beautiful forest with fast-running creeks that converged at various points with cascading waterfalls and miniature rapids. The rocks in the stream had a bright healthy green moss on them, fitting for St. Patrick’s Day. Yellow trillium was just starting to bloom, and I took some pictures of other flora as well. The beautiful scene passed quickly, and then I had a little road walking to do - just a short stretch across the Pigeon river and under I-40. I have kayaked a section of the Pigeon before. It is nicknamed “the dirty bird” because it used to be so polluted. I think it is much better now, but still not the greatest. I re-entered the forest and ce to the gravel road where the hostel is located. 
Standing Bear hostel was awesome! One of the employees greeted me as I walked in, two little dogs in tow. One dog set a small piece of wood on my foot - he wanted me to throw it. The hostel has a bunkhouse, cabins, and tenting space for a fee. They have a resupply store that is very convenient as you can get individual items, such as packs of oatmeal or other things that are normally sold in large boxes. I was able to get some more toothpaste, hand sanitizer, and ibuprofen, as well as food and plenty of snacks for getting to Hot Springs. The resupply pantry was interesting. Everything had prices and it was the honor system, so you had to tally up your stuff and take it to the crew to pay. They also had frozen foods I could eat there, and drinks. I got a frozen pizza, a frozen rib sandwich, a V-8, and a root beer for there. I know....but Hungry Cat must eat like a lion. Lots of hikers I knew were there and they had all gotten clean. I ate my pizza and talked with Nightmare, Diablo, Nomad, and a few others. I almost couldn’t finish the whole pizza after also eating the rib sandwich and chugging the V-8, but I still did it. The hostel had a nice charging station in the little kitchen as well, so I got a little juice. Everyone else was staying, but I wanted to get back on the trail. I filtered some water at the stream crossing right before the hostel and saw another hiker heading that way. He said he had hiked 25 miles that day. I pushed off in the opposite direction. 
It was quite the climb up to the campsite at dusk - 2.5 miles up. I got there in the dark and some other campers, also thru hikers, were there with a fire. They must be part of the wave in front of me. I set up my tent with my headlamp, the scrounged around for a branch to hang my food bag. It took a while to find a suitable branch, but I have learned the hard way to have patience :-). I hung this one on the first try.
I had purchased a hostess cupcake at the hostel for camp, but I was actually so full I saved it. Breakfast! I’m grateful for the amazing spring weather today and that the rain was pretty short. I’m grateful for the resupply and full meal, and to have the Smokies under my belt with no major catastrophes. I was thankful to be able to connect with my wife today, and to get a good camp spot by a stream. No signal here though so will have to back post tomorrow. Cat nap time!Postscripts:#1 kokopelli, thanks for the health tips!

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584423,"What do a king size snickers, a hostess cupcake, and two strawberry pop tarts all have in common? You should be able to get this one by now.... They were all part of my breakfast this morning, of course (with coffee)!
I slept in a bit and didn’t get up until about 8. I really slept well. It was warmer and I had the noise of the creek in the background. I got up to get my food bag and another hiker, Geo, was getting his off a different tree. He apologized for the noise they made last night. I told him I hadn’t noticed. He said that they heard a bear coming down the hill towards the creek, and then shined their headlamps and could see its eyes, so they made a bunch of racket and shouted to dissuade it from coming towards camp. I don’t think they were 100% sure it was a bear, but if they could hear it moving it couldn’t have been that small, and if they saw its eyes but not the rest of it, it probably wasn’t light colored like a deer. Whatever it was, I just slept like a baby.
I had breakfast in bag, set about getting my stuff packed, and then grabbed my trowel and TP to read the morning funny papers. I was actually sandwiched in between two creeks, and above me were hikers, so the only place far enough from the water and everyone else was straight up the hill across the creek, at about a 75 degree angle. I climbed through the bushes and grabbed shrubs and dug my boots in to scramble up to what looked like an area with a bit less angled slope. I must have looked like a confused chimpanzee trying to learn a new skill. I grabbed hold of a small tree to try and stabilize myself while I dug a cat hole. There were a lot of roots so it took a little while. Also, I was on a steep hill, so my dirt kept falling away on me. I then realized that I was going to have to cling to this tree while I read the funny papers, and so I went ahead and got my TP ready. When I was done, a lot of my dirt had rolled down the hill so I had to dig another mini hole to get dirt to fill my first hole. When that business was complete, I slid down the mountain less than gracefully, a triumphant chimp. 
I bandaged up my thumbs at camp and filtered water. My thumbs, especially my left one, have been cut open for much of the trip. I use them every day so the cuts don’t heal. The split on my left thumb gets wider. When I can get some new skin or something like that in a town, I will be very excited. In the meantime, I just sanitize them and try and cover them during the day time.
As I finished packing up camp, Postcard, the hiker who welcomed me to camp last night, was leaving. Not that long after, I hit the trail myself. It was probably close to 10 when I got going. I wandered a bit and then had a cell signal, so I stopped to finally update my journal. I carried on through various ups and downs until the sun came out, at which point I stopped to tape up some chafing spots on my now skeletal hip bones, dry out my tent fly, and eat something. Nomad, Willow and Transformer came by. We chatted for a bit. Transformer is from Australia and Willow is from Germany. Nomad is American. As we talked an older gentleman named Turtle came by. He said his wife was helping him slack pack as he did various sections of the trail. He said we might see her down the way, and that her trail name was Ramblin’ Rose. They all peeled off while I finished eating my tuna. 
The ups and downs continued. We were all waiting for the ku de tat - max patch. The sun was now out and the sky clear, so it would be a gorgeous view at the top of the bald. I passed Turtle eating a sandwich and then caught up to Nomad and the others. Nomad was expressing concern that he couldn’t get enough calories. They all three are vegetarian as well. His pack was already cinched as much as possible at the hip, with no room to move. The hunger struggle is real!
I moved on and as I got closer to max patch, I passed over the road that leads up to it (maybe it was 1182) and came to a beautiful little stream crossing. I filtered some water and completed a short climb, and there was the sign to the summit of max patch that the AT passes through, as well as a woman sitting down. I asked “are you Ramblin’ Rose?” “Why yes!” she said. We chatted a bit and she offered me water bottles to top off my water, as well as let me empty my trash. She was really awesome and I took a picture with her. I expect I will see her in the trail again. Thanks Rose!!
I picked up a lot of trash today. Ever since I met Chloe the Ridge Runner and she gave me the trail karma necklace, I have tried to pay more attention to when I pass trash. When I do, I pick it up and pack it out. I feel like it is an easy thing to do to make the trail a better place, so that’s what I’m going to do. And of course, the trail provides! I pick up a bunch of trash and trail angels show up to allow me to dump it! Service work has always lead me to a better place, and helped me to accept life on life’s terms, though I have been slow to come to learn this. If I love the trail, I have faith that it will love me back. If I look out for other hikers on the trail, I trust that they would do the same for me. Faith and service will get me through, and that’s why trail angels exist - they understand this and learn from the magic of the trail.
I climbed up max patch and the views were stunning. Pictures don’t do it justice. I had planned to find a nice sunny spot up there to cook a mid-day rice side, but as always happens, the trail had something else in mind. I came upon a small snowman next to one of the AT blazes. This poor snowman had an empty bottle of Champagne on both sides of him and looked pretty sad.  Obviously someone had a sense of humor. I heard a voice “hey are you a thru hiker?” I turned and a guy motioned me over. I saw Postcard sitting down. More trail magic? Yep! Three thru hikers from last year were giving out food and some drinks, as well as collecting trash! I grabbed a snickers and a honey bun and put the trash I had collected off the trail in the short time since I saw Ramblin’ Rose into their trash bag. I stayed to chat a while and enjoy the view. The three angels were Sticks (from Panama City Beach), Two Dogs (from Birmingham, AL), and Sea Wolf (not sure where she is from). Postcard took a picture of me with the three of them. We talked about the trail and they emphasized trying to stay present and enjoy every moment. So true! They said they wished they had documented their journeys a little more when I told them I was journaling. It was really fun chatting with them and I’m grateful for their trail service!! I decided to mosey on and hiked past beautiful max patch back down into the woods. I passed lots of charming streams with rustic log bridges over them. The “bridges” over all of the little streams along the AT are something I enjoy very much.
I made it to Roaring Fork Shelter. A lady hiker named Swass was there with her dog, whose trail name was Bur Bus because of all the burs he gets in his hair. He was a cool dog. I think she said he was 8. We chatted a bit about the Smokies. She was hiking with her husband and they were going to go back and hike the Smokies without Bur Bus since dogs aren’t allowed there. 
I decided to press on to the next shelter. I had lots of light left and it was a beautiful afternoon. I crossed over many more creeks and bridges, passed through Lemon Gap, and then walked over the bald into Walnut Mountain. It was there that I turned and took my last photo of the day over the bald as the sun was starting to get low in the sky. 
There was a group of guys at Walnut Mountain Shelter who were friends from Taylor University, every year they get together and do a section hike together. The shelter was full so I set up my tent far behind it on a pretty ridge. There were a few other tents. I cooked dinner at the table with the Taylor crew and chatted with them a bit. They were pretty funny. They asked about the Smokies so I relayed the tales of ice and frostbite. All the good stuff!
As I hung my food bag on the bear cables, Postcard rolled into camp. I think we are both planning to try and get an early start to Hot Springs in the morning. It’s a 13 mile hike and I want to have the afternoon for laundry, showering and eating!
I’m grateful for the weather and good company along the way today. The trail magic, and more so the people behind it, really were incredible and made the day so fun. I am thankful for all of the beautiful things I saw today - just countless. Time to get some sleep. What will the trail have in store tomorrow?
Just a heads up - last time I was in Hot Springs it was a cellular dead zone, so I may not have a signal to post until I leave. We’ll see....

",Walnut Mountain Shelter,"Mar 18, Sun",17.90
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584658,"I woke up to my alarm, which is unusual out here. I had set it to vibrate me awake early so that I could get into Hot Springs by lunch time. Then I could get some food and make sure I had enough time to resupply, do laundry, and those types of errands. It was hard to get up, but I did. I ran down to get my food bag off the bear cables, then sat in my tent and organized my gear and ate some pop tarts. It was still dark. I started to hear the pitter patter of rain, but as I broke down my tent it faded. When I went to get my food bag, I saw a couple I had met briefly that evening heading out of camp around 6:15. The night before the guy had told me there were no rooms in Hot Springs and that I should call ahead if I wanted something. It seemed odd to me as it was Monday, and at the same time hilarious. Call ahead - I have AT&T silly! I hardly ever have service on the trail! He said his wife had Verizon. It didn’t matter. I was sure I could find a bunk somewhere. The trail would provide! If i got the chance I would ring a couple of the hostels from my guidebook a few miles out from town so I could figure out where to stay and cruise right there. I headed out of camp with the aid of my headlamp as the sun was not yet up. 
The hiking early in the morning was very peaceful. The few raindrops I had felt at camp never returned. The blister I had wrapped a few days ago on my left toe was bothering me and occasionally the skin over my hip bones would burn a little from chafing. I used to have some nice puffy love handles in between my hip bones and my pack hip belt, but those cushions are gone now! I finally pulled over to check out the hot spot on my foot. I found a nice log to sit on and peeled off my socks. The blister itself hadn’t reformed. It looked like the new skin underneath the old dead skin was just tender. I re-wrapped it with leuko tape and moleskin. As I stood up to move on, I heard a “hello!” It was a small young man who looked a little like Richard Simmons with a big head of curls. It looked like he had been doing some ultralight trail running. He said he had been in Max Patch the day before. I told him I had just finished doctoring my foot and was continuing north. He was very nice and asked if I needed any tape or chafe cream. I would later find out from others that he carries everything he needs for a few days in his tiny backpack. Including some kind of tarp that he sleeps under. This pack was tiny, like Hello Kitty tiny! It was probably the size of my food bag.... 
The weather warmed up and the sun came out. I was hiking in my shorts and t shirt again and it felt great. When I was a mile out of Hot Springs, I randomly checked my phone and I had a signal! I decided to call the hostel I was most interested in - Elmer’s Sunnybank Inn. A guy named Matt answered the phone and said they did have rooms. In fact, they had a single room for only $25! I reserved it. The facilities were all shared, but I was used to that. Being able to sleep in peace and quiet though would be awesome! I couldn’t wait to get into Hot Springs to eat! To make sure I was only mostly ravenous, and not completely ravenous when I hit town, I quickly downed a tuna pack for a quick mercury injection. Wouldn’t want to have too many marbles after all!
The walk into Hot Springs was my first walk into a town on the AT. There really aren’t that many places where the trail passes through a town. The AT dropped out of the woods and onto a sidewalk that had unique AT markers in the pavement itself. I walked on. Sunnybank was right across the street from the Smokey Mountain Diner, which is an awesome place to get breakfast (my wife and I went to Hot Springs in the fall). 
I got to the diner, but i didn’t see a sign and the houses across the street just seemed like normal houses, so I walked on. I kept walking and knew I must’ve missed it, but then I saw the welcome center and decided to stop in and ask. A nice gentleman there told me I had indeed passed Sunnybank, and that it was “right down there on the corner.” Ok. I can do that. I walked back and it still just looked like a house. I checked my guide and l, sure enough, that was it. I guess I expected some kind of sign. Feeling a little sheepish, I walked up to the driveway side porch and there was a sign telling hikers to leave boots and trekking poles outside. I set down my pack and poles, kicked off my boots and walked in. I was in a kitchen.  There was an older man sitting at the counter reading a paper. I said hello. He kind of just stared at me, so I asked if there was someone who worked there as I was there to check in for the night. He started talking and I realized this was Elmer. He definitely had an odd flair to him. He showed me up to my room and gave me a sheet with some rules on it and a history of the house. I asked about laundry and he said there was a coin laundry down the street, and also told me where the best ATM was (it’s the one inside Bluff Mountain Outfitters as it only charges a $2 transaction fee instead of the $3 the others charge). We also passed by the house dog, whose name was Jimmy Carter (he prefers just Carter), and the house cat Pearl, who loves to play and cuddle. Awesome!! Hungry Cat would have some fur friends tonight!
I needed a shower but it was already 1:30, so instead I packed up my laundry and decided to go to the tavern restaurant in town and then hit the laundry a few doors down after. On the way out A guy who looked to be in his early 30s said hello. It turned out to be Matt, the guy who had taken my phone reservation. I asked him if the laundry had soap or if I needed to get that at the Dollar General across the street. He said they do have soap, BUT they don’t open for a few more weeks. Hmmmmm.... I wondered why Elmer didn’t volunteer this information. Matt said I could do my laundry there for 5 bucks. Even better! I told him I would do that when I came back.
I walked into the tavern and, since the weather was nice and I hadn’t showered, I headed to the outdoor seating area. As soon as I entered, I heard “Hungry Cat!” Skates and Weston (now “Clothesline” because he hangs one every day no matter where they camp), the two guys from Mt. Pleasant, were there eating with Candyman, Fifty, and two other girls. They were all showered and some were wearing  loaner clothes from another hostel while their own got clean. Candyman was particularly enamored with the 80s style high waisted jorts he had borrowed, and had his t-shirt tucked into them. I sat down with them, happy to have company for the meal. I ordered a root beer, and then I found out that Skates had ordered something called the “AT Burger.” It was apparently a thing, but not on the menu. I instantly liked the surprise aspect of it, so I ordered one too with tater tots. I also ordered a side salad. We talked about this and that and how we all made it through the smokies. I ate my side salad as we chatted. When the AT Burger came out, my eyes almost popped out of my head! It was a massive triple cheeseburger with other various toppings, served with. Knife sticking out of it straight down the middle. It all made sense somehow. I have never in my life eaten that ridiculously large of a burger, but I ate the whole thing and the tots too. Skates took part of his home. That’s why they call me Hungry Cat! I found out that Skates and Clothesline were also staying at Sunnybank. I also learned that Candyman and Fifty were actually a couple now. They met on the trail at Springer Mountain. Ah, young love - to stink so much and be so gross and still be able to bloom....
After lunch I went across the street to Bluff Mountain outfitters. They had a really great setup with some convenient resupply items. I picked up a bunch of stuff I needed. There was an ice cream store down the street and I really wanted ice cream, but I just couldn’t do it. I was bursting at the seams from that AT burger.    I walked back to the inn to do laundry instead. 
When I walked back inside the inn I saw Eddie Man. Apparently he had hiked out of Hot Springs yesterday, pulled a quad muscle and had to hike back into town to rest for a few days. I felt bad for him. He really does have a killer pace! I finally took a shower and got all my laundry clean. The shower felt so good!! I even used conditioner in my hair. I smelled so fresh and so clean, but still didn’t have an appetite because of the AT burger. I decided to skip dinner. Later in the evening I petted Pearl outside and saw that Postcard was at the inn as well. I chatted with her for a few minutes. She’s from Pennsylvania. I walked inside and saw Cole and his friend. It’s a small trail after all! 
I went upstairs to organize my resupply. Based on a comment Beaker made in my guest book, I decided to pass through Erwin and resupply in about 6 days at Greasy Gap via the Harbour Mountain B&B. I will go to Erwin another time when I paddle the Nolichucky (I have paddled this river once before and usually the guys at Uncle Johnny’s hostel will run shuttle). Greasy Gap would be a new adventure, and I can’t miss what another thru hiker claims is the best breakfast on the AT at the B&B! I finished organizing my food and went to the hallway bathroom. I turned on the light to find Pearl sitting on the sink playing with the dripping faucet. She then followed me back to my room and sat with me for a while. After she left, I went to bed, listening to rain and gusty wind outside. There was much talk about the weather that day. It seemed it would be rainy tomorrow and then there was a chance of snow up to an inch. That’s what ATweather.org said. I would soon find myself wishing that forecast was actually accurate. 
Hot Springs was a ton of fun and I’m grateful not only that I had a room where I could sleep well, but that the inn brought me in touch with new and old faces. I was grateful to have some fur friends as well! I wonder if Pearl likes to hike....
Postscripts: 
#1 - Beaker, thanks for the recommendations! I’m pretty excited for that breakfast! Also, at Standing Bear I actually checked expiry dates before I bought. I sized up the pantry and prices and figured they probably got a lot of that stuff for free, or close to it. A lot of stuff was expired, but I made sure the stuff that really mattered (eg my ibuprofen) was ok. It’s funny that you commented on that though as I’ll bet tons of hikers have that revelation. 
#2 - I’m late with this one, but Ron, yes I know LRC and have paddled both the chairlift and “upper two” sections. Upper two is my favorite section of LRC. I haven’t tried the suicide section yet because I not ready to die. I have also paddled South Sauty. Eastern Alabama has some great whitewater!
#3 - Sunnybank Inn was really interesting. You can eat meals there too, cooked with organic veggies all grown on site. Elmer is a vegetarian so the meals are vegetarian. It’s also the oldest house in town dating back pre civil war. Elmer has a large and unique book collection. I’d really like to go back for a weekend with Gillian and enjoy the Inn a bit more. And this time get ice cream!
#4 - Sometimes I misspell things for funny reasons. It was pointed out to me that I misspelled coup d’tat. I spelled it Ku de tat, which is actually the name of a bar I went to in Bali north of Kuta. They had great earl grey infused martinis, as I remember. Anyway, it’s weird that spelling stuck in my head. I once lost a spelling bee as a kid by spelling the word “check” as “chek,” thanks to Chek Cola. My brain....","Walnut Mountain Shelter
",Hot Springs,"Mar 19, Mon",13.10
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584659,"I woke up pretty early. I had stayed awake later than expected, but I was ready to eat! I got dressed and walked across the street to the diner. I ordered coffee and a breakfast burrito, and in walked Skates and Clothesline. We talked about resupply plans while we ate. As we were finishing up, a local guy who was leaving asked us if we were still going to go into the mountains with all the bad weather coming. Hmmmm.... I don’t remember the AT weather forecast looking that bad. He said Hot Springs was supposed to get 6-7 inches of snow. If Hot Springs is at a low elevation, then the mountains would surely get much more. We looked at each other and said “surely it can’t be worse than the Smokies.” I should know better than to say things like that. 
I went back to the inn and got my stuff ready to go. I re-taped my blisters and also cut some extra length off my pack hip belt adjustment straps, cauterized the ends and sewed them back over in a fold with my dental floss and needle. It wasn’t pretty but I was happy with it. Time to hit the trail, but I wanted to stop at the outfitter first.
At the outfitter I picked up a new pair of gaiters. I haven’t been happy with the Altras for a number of reasons, so I got some dirty girl gaiters (yes, that’s the actual brand name). I also picked up an avocado to go with a bag of chips I got at Dollar General last night. I was hoping to catch up to Skates and Clothesline and surprise them with some trail guac trail magic - an avocado cut up inside the shell to dip chips in. I also got a banana for some potassium. An hour later I would wish I had just gotten ice cream. Maybe they would have had banana splits....
The climb out of Hot Springs is steep. Once out of town, the trail meanders along the French Broad River and then shoots straight up to a popular lookout spot called Lover’s Leap. Views were good. The day was sunny and warm. I had expected rain so I had rain pants and my rain jacket on at first, and then took the jacket off. I climbed sweatily up the various inclines. About 8 miles in the sun disappeared. I wouldn’t see it again until, well, I’m not sure as I haven’t seen it yet....
The rain came. I made it two more miles to  Spring Mountain Shelter. It was a tiny shelter and already full. Skates and Clothesline were there, so I took a break and bestowed the trail guac upon them. I had hauled up an avocado for myself too, so we all enjoyed it. At that point I needed to head on. I figured if I was going to tent in the rain, I might as well get farther down the trail. The next shelter was 9 miles away. That was a bit far; I just kept walking. 
The rain increased in intensity and I powered along. I really wanted to cap near a water source, but the only campsites with water were by busy roads. There were a lot of road crossings on this section of trail. At some point I just decided to commit to the 9 miles and get to the next shelter.
There were more steep climbs and the rain was dousing me, but I managed to pull into Little Laurel Shelter about an hour before dark. There was only one other guy there - John, a welding student from Illinois. He was interesting. He was 26, hated Illinois saying it was all corrupt and that he wanted to move to Colorado. He seemed to have a decent knowledge of camping and hiking, but at the same time he was dressed in jeans and only had the clothes on his back - no extra pants or dry socks for camp. He said he had gotten there before the rain came. He was partially staying warm by drinking Tin Cup whiskey out of a Nalgene bottle. I chatted with him a bit as I made my dinner and did camp chores. The weather was getting nasty and I could feel the temperature dropping. It was super foggy and hard to even see to get to the bear cables. John checked the weather (he had Verizon) and it talked about the potential for several inches of snow overnight. Ok, I thought. If it snows a few inches, no worries. 
I was quite tired after the long miles today, but grateful that I pressed on and got shelter space. I was thankful that I could embrace the rain and enjoy hiking in it. I enjoyed not being in a crowded shelter as I fell asleep.","Hot Springs
",Little Laurel Shelter,"Mar 20, Tue",19.60
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584660,"It was snowing when I woke. There looked to be an inch on the ground. It was quite pretty! John was still asleep. I set about getting ready for breakfast ad to ship out. I had coffee and two oatmeal packets (maple brown sugar, of course). John woke up and said he really hadn’t prepared for the weather. I pictured him hiking in jeans today.... I told him if he did decide to hike and wanted a shelter spot, it was probably best to hustle. That’s exactly what I did. 
The snow was really coming down. I knew that Skates and Clothesline were going to Jerry’s Cabin Shelter, about 7 miles from me. I really wanted to make Flint Mountain Shelter another 7 miles after that. I figured I would see how it went. As I started hiking there were no tracks I front of me - I was the first up and hiking, blazing trail. That meant there was likely wide open shelter space at the first shelter. 
The snow intensified. In many cases it swirled around like a big whiteout. It was snowing so hard that it was hard to look up sometimes as the wind would drive it into my face and eyes. It started accumulating quickly. I was having a good time though and enjoying the beauty of it. It’s funny how a weather app can be inaccurate, and I still believe what it says, but when the local at the diner talks about a snowpocalypse, I laugh it off as hyperbole. Sigh.... Hungry Cat when will you learn?
At mile 298 I hit Bearwallow Gap and there was a sign that said “bad weather bypass trail.” It warned of exposed ridge line along the AT and I guess the trail was there as a safety precaution. Weather isn’t bad or good; it’s just weather! Therefore I would not take the bypass trail. Also, I’m a white blazer, so doing so is not in my creed. I hoped I wouldn’t die on the ridge line....
The ridge actually wasn’t that bad, nor was its focal point Firescald Knob. There was a bit of rock scrambling and there were gusty winds, but that’s it. Oh and snow. LOTS of snow.
I hit mile 300 just before the Jerry’s Cabin Shelter - woohoo! The snow continued to intensify. I checked the log at Jerry’s and only two people had logged in last night. They would probably go farther than Flint Mountain, so I decided to push on. Also, it was hard enough to walk in the deep snow as it was. If it continued to snow overnight, this section would just be harder tomorrow. I marched on.
In some places the drifts were up to two feet. I could largely avoid those, but the snow on the trail was already over my boots. It was challenging to hike in. Skis would have been easier! In the Smokies the real challenge was ice. I didn’t experience this large a snowfall there. I never had to blaze trail in the Smokies; there were always prior footsteps. I loved having the opportunity to walk the trail in the snow with no visible foot prints. It felt very adventurous!
Soon I came to Big Butt Bypass. I guess if you can’t handle the Big Butt, they give you a way out. I, on the other hand, like Big Butts and I cannot lie, so I kept on the AT. Also, blue blazing is not an option for me. I want to walk every inch of the AT from here north without using any shortcuts or bypass trails.
By the time I rolled into Flint Mountain Shelter, the snow was just ridiculous. It was coming down in beautiful powder sheets with a nice hurricane wind slant factor. I was so happy to be at the shelter, and no one else was there! The shelter needed sweeping as it was full of snow that had blown in. I did that and made some chili Mac. While cooking I tried to thaw my boots and dry my socks by setting them around my cook pot. It helped a little, but my boots will definitely be frozen in the morning. I took my tent tarp and hung it outside the shelter to help cover the opening where snow was blowing in. It helped. A kid named Eagle showed up. I had met him before at Fontana. He strung up his tarp as well. Somehow, snow is still lightly blowing through the eaves of the shelter. 
It was an intense day of hiking and I’m grateful that I was safe and warm enough, that I got to break trail and feel adventurous, and that I got a shelter spot - half a shelter in fact!
I do not know what tomorrow brings. I hear the low will be 24 tonight and then it might stop snowing in the morning. We shall see.... now I have to run out in the cold and pee. Maybe I should consider that Gatorade bottle....","Little Laurel Shelter

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584715,"I slept burrowed in my sleeping bag all night. It must have dipped below 20 degrees as I was a bit chilly, but not cold enough to get out of my bag and dig through my pack for more layers. I have a mummy bag, and I had it completely closed off, breathing my own carbon dioxide most of the night. It’s like the hiker’s version of blackout curtains. I opened the bag a tad and peeked out. The sun was coming up. A time check revealed it was 7:30 - time to get cracking!
My boots were frozen, as expected. I pushed on them and kneeled on them to break them up a bit, and then jammed my feet in them to run get my food bag off the bear cables. It was a brisk 20-22 degrees out. When I got back, Eagle was stirring in his nest. I took my boots back off and froze my feet in my crocs while I boiled water for breakfast and coffee. I put my boots beside my stove and leaned my seat pad against them to help reflect the heat back in towards them to thaw them out. I really should take a picture of this at some point. It really helps to get them on properly. I ate two bags of maple brown sugar oatmeal, a cliff bar, and had a cup of coffee. I didn’t get out of camp until 9:30, but I figured I could still get 18 miles in. Hahahaha hahahaha! 
The hiking started out ok. It was largely 3 inch deep snow on the trail. That quickly became 4-5 inches. No problem! That went on for a few miles until after Devil’s Fork Gap. At that point, I hit the start of a big three mile climb. Again, no problem. I shed a few layers and kept climbing. Somewhere towards the top, the snow drifts started getting sporadically deeper. And then at the top of the climb, even deeper. I could mostly avoid the deep sections, which were about a foot and a half deep. It was slowing me down though. 
I took pictures of beautiful views along the way: a log bridge across a creek, a waterfall in the snow. I climbed a bit higher and this time encountered drifts that I could not avoid. They were getting deeper. I was sinking up to my calf or knee with every step, and still climbing. This would continue the rest of the day. On the one seemingly “easy” downhill section, I slipped and fell on my butt. This cat doesn’t always land on his feet. I was fine though - my pride went out the window a long time ago!
As I got closer to Hogback Ridge, the drifts got even deeper. The snow was literally coming up to my crotch in some of them. The first time that happened it felt like I was falling into quicksand! At a towering 5’8” I didn’t have the legs for this. I pictured Skates and Clothesline finding just my torso sticking out of the snow, lips blue, maybe with a cliff bar or two sticking out of my mouth. Hungry Cat’s last attempt at food!
It took me almost 6 hours to go 8.8 miles to the shelter. I got to the shelter at about  
5 past 3. I knew I didn’t have it in me to go another 10 miles, so I decided to stay. 
I was the first one there, so I swept snow out of the shelter and off the picnic table, which was in the sun. The one saving grace was that today had been sunny and it was no longer snowing. I hurried to get water and my sleeping gear laid out so that I could set my boots and socks and whatnot in the sun to at least partially dry out. I’d say the temperature was right about at 32 degrees, so the sun would really help. The water source was a quarter mile walk down a hill, so I made sure to get enough so I wouldn’t have to do the walk again. I also resolved to eat two dinners. I wanted to make up a bit of mileage tomorrow and get close to Erwin and hopefully warmer temperatures. The extra calories would help give me a boost for the morning. I ate a backpackers pantry Katmandu Curry that was awesome. I had two cliff bars, and a knife rice side with added olive oil. I topped that off with a tuna packet. Right about then the Taylor University reunion crew showed up. They are a fun lot. Then Candyman, Fifty, Stumbles and Cheddar arrived, but just to eat and run another two miles ahead to a hostel. They were at lunch when I had the AT Burger. Apparently they have all been hiking together almost since the start of the trail. Stumbles and Cheddar gifted me a bag of Doritos, a cow tail, and a gummy worm, all of which I ate immediately. What an awesome dinner! 
Those kids hustled to the hostel, and then a girl named Caterpillar showed up. She was going to the hostel with them as well. She paused to eat something, and then took off. The Taylor crew said that Skates and Clothesline were coming. They finally rolled in about 30 minutes later. One of Skates’ trekking poles had broken. Clothesline had a hole in one of his shoes. They were both looking a bit beaten down.  They recovered a bit after they got warm and ate some food. We all talked a bit about Harry Potter, and I found out that other hikers I had met and had breakfast with at Fontana, Weeble and False Alarm,had met playing quidditch. Apparently that is a thing outside of the books. 
Time to call it a day. Tomorrow I hope to get much closer to Erwin! Hopefully the snow drifts will not be as challenging as today. I’m grateful for the sun and blue skies today, and also the lack of new snow and beautiful winter scenery. Tomorrow’s adventures await! 
As a postscript today, I give you a little write up on trail hygiene. 
Trail Hygiene:
Trail hygiene is a thing. What I mean is, obviously trail life isn’t always the most hygienic life, but there are definitely certain things we do try to do on the trail to stay healthy. 
#1 - No touching! We don’t shake hands, we don’t high five. At the most, we fist bump. Why? Touching other people’s hands and then touching your own face is a great way to get sick, or contract/transit Nora virus. Life is hard enough on the trail without getting ill! If you’re meeting thru hikers, do them a favor by not shaking their hands! Fist bump if ya gotta. Also, we pretty much have runny noses all day hiking in the cold. We are professional snot rocket blowers! Yet another reason not to touch hands or fists! 
#2 - No sharing/tasting food or water bottles, etc. The same reasons as #1 apply. 
#3 -Use hand sanitizer. I don’t always wash my hands every day, but I do use hand sanitizer. I use it after touching things at the shelter, using the privy, and before handling food to the extent I remember. 
I know this may make me or other hikers look like germaphobes, but we are out here trying to accomplish a goal, and our immune systems are already stressed. I personally do not want the misery of being sick on the trail! Imagine the last time you had to hug the toilet. Now imagine that you had no toilet to hug and were in the woods, cold, wet and Ill with three days to hike out to get to a town. Lots of fun right? That’s why we are careful. 
I’m also careful to monitor small cuts. I have two right now that won’t seem to stay closed because they are on my thumbs. I keep them clean and wrapped as I can. I carry a very small, focused first aid kit for aches, pains, cuts and the like, and that includes antibiotic ointment. You can get travel versions of these things at REI. 
Lastly, we all have to do it. We all poop. On the trail, some shelters have privies. If the shelter has a privy, that is where you should go. It’s like an outhouse. The only thing that can go in the privy is toilet paper and your poo. No wipes!! Wipes in general are bad for sewage systems, but they definitely need to be packed out on the trail. The privies are essentially composting toilets. You usually have to throw a fist full of sawdust in after you go. If you throw wipes in the privy, not only can it mess up the composting system, but a volunteer will probably have to pick them out. Imagine if you had to do that! Capital G GROSS!!!
What if there isn’t a privy? You have to dig a cat hole. Basically, you dig a hole at least 6 inches deep and then go in that. You have to bury your poop and toilet paper in the hole. Again, no wipes! Pack those out. Of course, we have to make sure we dig our cat holes far away from camp and any water source. What do you dig with? I use an ultralight camp trowel called the Deuce of Spades and I love it. For overnight trips we have the classic orange plastic trowel. Some people who want to go really lightweight just use the tip of a trekking pole, but it can be hard to cut through roots with that. I always carry a trowel.
As for other hygiene, I try and clean myself up a bit on the trail when I can, but i largely stink! No room for deodorant on this trip! I do carry a small bottle of Doctor Bronner’s soap to clean cookware, and sometimes my hands and face. I use wipes sometimes as well, though those can inconveniently freeze in the winter! Sometimes I use creeks to splash water on my face, and maybe use my buff to do a quick wipe down. At the end of the day, a long distance hiker is just going to stink!","Flint Mountain Shelter

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585016,"The morning cold cut deep when I got out of my sleeping bag at 6. It was still dark and I wanted nothing more than to wait for the sun to come up, but I needed to get moving. Yesterday’s hiking through snow drifts had taught me a valuable lesson: it can always get harder; it can always get tougher. It’s not that I didn’t know this, but I can only anticipate so much based on the experience I have, which with snow is very little before this trip. I wanted an early start today to give me plenty of time to deal with obstacles. Overall, I hoped to hike a 20 mile day and get to the last shelter before Erwin. I knew that was lofty so I figured I would just see how things went. Everyone else was still asleep. I planned breakfast on the go, so I packed up my stuff, for my wet gear on for snow, brushed my teeth and left. I was on the trail somewhere just after 7 (I think).
My breakfast was a bar I picked up in Hot Springs at Bluff Mountain Outfitters. It was called a Big Sur bar and looked like a huge breakfast blondie with dates, nuts, etc. The guy at the store had recommended it. It was a balmy 22 degrees or so outside, so I had put it in my pocket when I was packing up to thaw it out. It was delicious! I could’ve eaten 10 of them....
I tried to move quickly to warm up. My hands were hurting from the cold, even with my gloves, so I alternated putting one in my pocket while using the other to hold both trekking poles but still to stabilize myself. There were still big drifts, so it was tough. It took longer than usual, but my hands finally got warm enough to stop the pocket game, so I could push myself through the snow better. After a bit I started a noticeable descent towards Sam’s Gap. I could see dirt again! This was much easier going. I crossed a road and walked under a highway underpass at the Gap. On the other side I noticed a “welcome to Tennessee” highway sign. After Sam’s Gap I started to climb again. 
As I kept going higher, in the distance I noticed this mountain with an incredibly snowy bald on the top. I thought to myself “that’s kind of cute - I bet it feels like Everest up there though.” Insert evil laugh here. I didn’t realize it then, but that is where I was headed. 
The ridiculous amount of food I had eaten the day before paid off in that I felt fairly strong. I took good solid strides and didn’t feel like my legs were made of lead. I climbed and climbed towards Bald Mountain Shelter, 10 miles from Hogback Ridge. I could feel the wind gusts pick up,
and then there appeared a break in the tree line. Before me stood a white desert. It was snow, but it looked like sand. Little bits of grass showed through in some places. This was Big Bald.
The trail almost seemed to go up and disappear, an illusion created by the horizon line. I followed it up. I kept putting one foot in front of the other until I could see the rest of the climb I had up the bald. I don’t know why, but i turned around and almost fell over with awe and surprise. The views, unobstructed by any clouds or trees, were breathtaking! I climbed up to the top of the bald and the views were 360 degrees of beauty. It was spectacular! I took some photos, though they could never do it justice. it was hard to stay up on the bald as the wind was blowing fiercely and it was so cold. I took a little 360 degree video for Gillian and then skedaddled downhill. From Big Bald the trail dropped down to a smaller bald. Getting down this was challenging. In a few places the snow was waist deep! I tried to avoid the really deep drifts. 
After the balds I arrived at Bald Mountain Shelter. It was empty, but I decided to make some lunch there. Trying to be quick, I set some water to boil for ramen and ate a few snacks. I signed the shelter log. It was an interesting shelter. It was two stories and each hiker’s “slot” was already built into the wood. It’s the only one like that I have seen so far. While I was eating the Taylor Crew showed up. Man, those guys are beasts!! I was moving at a fast clip and they kept up pace. They told me they were hiking the 27 miles into Erwin. Their car was there and I think they were about ready to be done with their trip. They had plans to go into town and eat pizza. They had some leftover cliff bars and were super cool and gave me 4!! I was incredibly grateful as i needed calories to keep me going. I wish I had gotten a picture with those guys as I really enjoyed their company. I immediately ate two of the cliff bars, then downed my ramen. They left about 10 minutes before I did.
As I walked down the trail I saw a man with a dog headed my way. He was on skis! I’m sure he was doing a lot better than I was getting around. Shortly after him I ran into two guys with a dog. One of the guys said he had thru hiked the AT with his girlfriend and that dog a few years ago. I wish I had asked if the dog had a trail name.
I bumped into he Taylor Crew before the next big climb. We all headed up it and I had to strip layers at the top. After that it was all downhill until the snow was gone! I never thought I would be so happy to see mud. I was out of water so I stopped at a stream to I’ll up. I had been out for a while and was thirsty going up the last club, though quite happy not to be carrying water weight. I grabbed handfuls of snow and let them melt in my mouth as I climbed.
As the trail evened out the Taylor guys fell behind me. The climbs started again, and again there was some snow, albeit not much. I passed a water source, walked about another third of a mile, and I was at the target shelter. I had hiked 20 miles! No one was there, and the. I started thinking, what if I just get the heck out of dodge and push 7 more miles? That would take me into the gorge, away from snow, and I could find a place to camp along the beautiful Nolichucky river. The more I thought about it, the more I liked the plan. The weather was supposed to be wet tomorrow, so better to get the gorge views today. I took off! 
The hiking was not that difficult comparatively. I cruised in down and found myself at the river at just before 7pm. I had pictured things differently, however, thinking that I would find a stealth campsite. The trail emptied onto a road, and continued on a bridge. Below the riverbank was very rocky and trashy, more akin to an underpass than a camping place. I checked the other side and didn’t see any good options. There was a hostel right there called Uncle Johnny’s, so I reluctantly went in and inquired about a space. A bunk was 22 bucks, and since it was about to be dark I took it. They had some frozen pizzas, so I cooked two of Those in a toaster oven and also had a jumbo honeybun and a Reese’s cup. I know - super healthy. I washed it down with a V8 and a Yoo-hoo. Some guy then gave me another honey bun, which I also ate. 
A guy named Okie was in the hostel. I had seen his name on the shelter logs and recognized it from the journal of Vagabond Jack. I started reading Jack’s journal early on to get excited about my trip and got hooked into following his progress. I was hoping to meet him on the trail just north of Hot Springs, but he hurt his toe and had to come off for a few days, so I missed him. Oh well, maybe later our paths will cross. 
I took a shower at Johnny’s, which felt good. They had awesome WiFi there, so I was able to backup my photos to a google drive. This was the first really good WiFi I had gotten on the trail. In the morning I would grab some breakfast and hit the trail, but before doing so would call Harbour Mountain Inn to book a bunk for two nights ahead. 
I was too tired to journal. It had been a long day with many mikes and was time to go to sleep. I was grateful for my strength today, the bunk that would allow me a good sleep, and the warm fire inside of the bunkhouse to keep it cozy. It was a good day.
Postscripts: 
#1 - Hey Joe, I actually do thumb type my journals on my phone. It is tedious but worth it! I don’t really have a better way. Dictation is frustratingly inaccurate and not practical at shelters. I feel like all this phone typing should make me younger!
#2 - Joe, I use the old school paper AWOL trail guide. I like it. It comes in pdf form. There is also guthook, which is a good app guide. I just liked the old school approach, which is one reason why I am also journaling on this site versus a more technologically modern platform. One reason I chose the physical guide was to not have to use my phone battery to save it for photos, video, and journaling. However, Guthook is great for knowing how far water is and for being sure you’re at a particular location, which you’ll see was a problem for me later....
#3 - David, thanks for the tip on keeping boots from freezing. The real trade off is sleeping bag space I guess, and the fact that the boots won’t dry in the bag. If I can get a bag big enough though that I’m sure won’t leak in my down bag, I may try this. When it’s this cold, I would also have my filter and water in the bag - crowded house! I roll over a lot at night, so that can get interesting with a crowded toe box.
#4 - Phillip, I think about all sorts of stuff, but mostly repetitive stuff, sadly. I thought about fried chicken a lot one day. I often get songs stuck in my head. Lately Christmas carols have been haunting me. HAUNTING! How many hours can frosty the snowman stay in my head? A lot. It’s the snow driving that. But I often think about ideas I have, or family and friends. I wonder what Gillian is doing or what the cat Lucy is doing. Sometimes I’m like Ben Stiller in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, picturing myself summiting Everest and bass jumping off of it, gliding back to Kathmandu. You know, the usual stuff.
#5 - Jason, I haven’t completely revolted anyone with my stench yet! That day will come though. I am preparing some notes on camp chores and town/hostel chores for a later date.
#6 - Shane, thanks! I will check that video out when I can.","Hogback Ridge Shelter

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585017,"I woke to my bed shaking. I was in the top bunk, and the guy below me, Joe, was getting ready early. I went back to sleep for a bit. Finally, around 7 I woke again and decided to be awake. Joe had been hiking with Eddie Man after Obiwan finished his section hike. I asked him if he had news on Ed’s leg. Joe said that Ed had to get off the trail and would not be able to finish his hike. I felt so bad hearing this, as I know how I would feel if injury or illness cut my hike short. I also will genuinely miss running into Ed. He was a great guy and I really wanted to hear more about his life.
I had things to do before I could leave. First, I organized my bag. I checked the hiker box and there were some great food finds that I could use, so I scooped those up. One was a jiffy peanut butter single serve cup. I took that and dipped my morning pop tarts in it. Yum! After that I taped my feet and thumb back up. I am so glad I got that new skin! It really helped everything, including my blisters! Next I called the Harbour Inn and booked a room for tomorrow night. I could walk there right off the AT and resupply - super convenient! Lastly, I bought another Yoo-hoo and a few little things to top off breakfast. 
There was a lot of hesitation to hike today at the hostel. Joe pushed on and I was going to push on, but the others were waffling. It was raining and the weather was supposed to be rainy, snowy, sleety the next few days. I headed out. 
Once I got across the river and into the woods, I warmed up and the rain slackened a bit. The trail was beautiful today. I eventually climbed high enough to be back in the snow, but it never really rained hard or snowed hard. It was a good day for walking!
The weather obstructed most of the ridge and mountain views. I walked across a long meadow-like bald, but covered in snow. there was a lot of fog and mist. The fir trees reappeared, and the forest became quiet, dark, and mysteriously still. It somehow reminded me of the scenes of Bastogne in Band of Brothers. It made me think how tough it would have been to have to dig and sleep in fox holes in that bitter cold. I took a few photos and moved on to keep warm. I ran into a south bounder! His name was Shark. He started in Pennsylvania on January 1! That’s asking for some pretty crazy weather! He’s going to hike to the southern terminus at Springer Mountain, then return to PA and finish his hike to Katahdin. 
I made it to Cherry Gap Shelter just before 5. Joe was here, as well as a handful of others. I squeezed into the shelter, and before the evening was up we would squeeze in two more people. It had stopped snowing and was now sprinkling. I ate dinner - chili Mac, Reese’s cups, an oatmeal packet - got water, and hung my food bag (without incident!). I started to look at my guide book to plan getting to the Inn tomorrow, and a cold chill swept over me. I had goofed. I misread my book and the Inn wasn’t walking distance from greasy gap, it was walking distance from a road that was two days away. I quickly recovered, however, realizing that I could resupply if needed at greasy gap via another hostel, albeit less convenient as it was farther off the trail. I also might have enough food to just wait another day, and decided I would check in the morning. I need to call the Inn when I have a signal tomorrow to reschedule my reservation. I once took a trip to Maine with my wife. We got to a holiday inn express in Portland. I had made the reservation for a holiday inn express in Portland........ Oregon! I do these things sometimes. 
I was incredibly thankful that the weather wasn’t so bad today. I am grateful that I have a shelter spot and, despite the amazing chorus of snoring happening as I type, I should sleep well tonight. Hungry Cat, zzzzzzzzz.......","Uncle Johnny’s Nolichucky Hostel
",Cherry Gap Shelter,"Mar 24, Sat",17.10
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585018,"The shelter stirred early, just before sunrise. Mornings at the shelters seem to have a cadence to them. One person wakes up and starts fidgeting and slowly getting ready while trying to be quiet, and then another person begins to stir, and soon everyone is up, whether they wanted to be or not. I don’t think I’ve ever slept past 7 at a shelter. 
We all bustled about getting out gear ready, reluctantly stripping off layers or our night clothes for our less warm hiking clothes. My socks were still wet from the day before, as were my boots. I winced as I pulled the cold, wet socks on. This is one of my least favorite things in the morning. But, as the saying goes, I just have to “embrace the suck.” Once I hiking and my feet warm up, it isn’t too horrible that they are wet. They’re just wet stinky hiker feet.
Next I went to get my food bag. There were no cables so I had to hang it. I had heard a guy named Nate talking a few minutes ago about having issues getting his bear bag down. He said something about using the PCT hanging method caused him issues. I use the PCT method when I hang my bag. It is supposed to be safer than just hoisting the food bag over a branch and tying off the rope onto a nearby tree. Apparently some bears have gotten wise to that and will just claw at the tied off portion of rope until the rope breaks and the bag falls. With the PCT method, you use a carabiner, lock your bag into the rope end and then pass the loose hoisting end of the rope through the carabiner as well. Then you pull the rope until the bag rises to touch the branch, and you take a small stick and wrap the end of the rope around the middle of it a bunch of times. You then let the bag lower until the stick hits the carabiner. Your bag is now hanging, suspended, and if a bear hits the loose end of the rope, nothing will happen. Here’s what happened. As we were going to bed it started raining, and then while we were asleep it all froze. My food bag rope, carabiner, PCT hang setup all froze! When I pulled on the rope to release the stick from the contraption, nothing happened because it was all frozen together. Ugh! I thrashed about with it and finally went to get Nate, who is very tall, to see if he could help. I was able to pull the bag far enough down to where he grabbed a corner and shook it, and that dislodged everything. It was very nerve wracking - I needed that food! I learned an important lesson. Only PCT hang if it isn’t going to sleet or rain and then freeze overnight.
After all that, I checked my food and realized I could stretch it one more day. The following day I would be hungry, but then I would resupply. This would also keep my pack weight lighter to help me conserve energy. I had an option to resupply at a hostel at Greasy Creek Gap, but that would take me 1.2 miles out of my way, so I would skip that. I decided then that I would hike about 19 miles to Roan High Knob Shelter, the highest Shelter on the AT. 
The temperature quickly rose to hover right at about freezing. I hiked through a lot of misty fog, and as the temperature warmed a bit, snow and ice started melting. At one point I was in an area where ice was just cascading down all around from the trees. It sounded like broken glass and looked surreal. I was hungry but I pushed on, trying to stretch the two cliff bars and peanut butter packet I had for the rest of the day before dinner. I had heard from another hiker, a girl named Inside Out, that there might be trail magic at Hughes Gap. I knew I shouldn’t get too excited, but it was hard not to be hopeful. When I got to Hughes Gap, I saw a truck! I bounded down into the gap to see if it was trail magic. It was not. My heart did not sink though. Somehow I felt ok, so I just pressed on and ate a cliff bar. 
The rest of the day was largely a mix of snow, slush and mud. My feet were pretty wet. I started the climb up to Roan High Knob. At a point it leveled out and I was at Ash Gap, an absolutely beautiful little oasis in the snow desert, with places to tent and pretty scenery. It was green and not white! I passed a thru hiker named Hawk along the way, and then a guy named “Mizzman.” I am not sure on the spelling as he was on the phone when I passed by. He must have Verizon .... in Ash Gap I met a hiker named Derwood. He was also headed to the shelter. We talked about how nice Ash Gap was. He also said he was reading my journal, which was cool. Derwood, if you are reading this then it will explain a few things, namely why I didn’t show up at the shelter. That’s right -  I never made it to Roan High Knob.
I kept on trekking up and up and then the trail leveled off. My feet were pretty wet from stepping inches deep, over and over  in melted snow. I kept walking and walking and then the trail headed down at a gradual slope. This should have been a clue that I needed to check my map, but usually the shelters or signs to them are easy to see. The trail became a literal creek. All of the melting snow funneled together and water was just flowing down the trail. Kersplosh, kersplosh! Every step I took filled my boot with oh-so-warm-and-comfortable snow melt. Still no shelter. I moved faster. Finally I ran into a man and he asked where I was headed. He was another thru hiker. When I told him the shelter he said i had passed it! Noooooo! Apparently I had flown by it and gone about another two miles. I was only a tenth of a mile from Carver’s Gap. I knew I definitely wasn’t going back, not through the sloshy river again. I had three choices:
1 - I could push another 4 miles and change and stay at Stan Murray Shelter. 
2 - This gentleman was actually going to call Harbour Inn and have them pick him up at Carver’s Gap. I could go there a day early with him. 
3 - I could find a place to stealth camp at Carver’s Gap.
I chose 3. I really wanted to see if the weather tomorrow would cooperate so I could hike a side trail up Grassy Bald. If I pushed to the next shelter I would miss that. Going to the hostel early would not take advantage of the fact that I could waltz in off the trail tomorrow. I set about filtering some water at a nearby stream and thought about camping spots.
Gillian and I had been here once before for a section hike, so I walked around to where we parked in that parking lot. I then walked on a little trail back up behind the bathroom. Everything was so slanted. There was one level spot right by the parking lot. Surely this was my lowest moment in terms of tent site choices! I started to set up there but the ground was all gravel and I couldn’t sink any tent stakes. I had to move to a slightly snowy spot on an incline. It was definitely less than ideal. I had a nice view of the parking lot bathroom building. I pitched my tent as fast as possible; I was itching to get my cold boots and socks off and get warm. I put on warm clothes and then went back outside to cook. I moved to the parking lot at one point trying to dry stuff out in the sun, but it was late in the day and the sun spot was gone in about 5 minutes. The wind picked up so I lugged my boots and socks, and the cookware I had brought over, back by my tent. I boiled water and started a backpackers pantry Chana Masala cooking. I had a package of ramen, some instant mashed potatoes, and two oatmeal packets left. I decided I would eat the mashed potatoes too. I started heating water for those and my fuel canister emitted the last of its fuel. Hmmmmm.... I took my cold water and poured it into the mashed potato bag and started stirring. After it thickened, I hungrily started swallowing huge spoonfuls of it. I was ready to get into my sleeping bag and get warm, so in a way food was more of a means to an end at this point. I think I shoved the first few spoonfuls of mashed potatoes in my mouth too fast, and before they had properly mixed with water. All of a sudden I was doing some kind of uncomfortable acid reflux choking on them. I sputtered and gagged a little, and then I was ok. Yeah, I definitely ate the rest of those potatoes! A little gagging and choking never hurt anyone! By then my Chana Masala was ready. Man, backpackers pantry for the win again!! It was delicious and spicy. After I ate that, I hurriedly brushed my teeth and ran to get into bag. 
Today did not go as planned. I feel weird camping by this parking lot. BUT, I’m grateful that at least the weather was ok today, and that I am able to be warm, and that tomorrow I will have a warm place to sleep and hopefully dry out my feet a bit. I should have WiFi tomorrow as well so I can upload my journal entries. 
Derwood, sorry I missed getting to chat with you at the shelter! I’m playing hobo by the parking lot :-)","Cherry Gap Shelter

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585118,"Last night was a bit of a low point. I felt like I had made a sketchy decision camping next to this parking lot. The wind picked up last night and it got cold. I managed to sleep ok though, and woke up just before 7. I figured the parking lot toilet was there, so I went and used that. When I went to get my food bag down, the rope was frozen to the tree again, but this time a little tugging did the trick to bring it down. I learned from the last time and did not hang it with the PCT method. I was also happy that I slept ok and was not awakened with fits of indigestion from the mashed potatoes I had shoveled into my gullet last night, though I did spend half the night hoisting myself back up my air mattress like a beached whale - I tented on a ridiculous incline again because it was all I could find. I ducked back into my sleeping bag for a few minutes to get warm. The trail was an immediate climb up to the balds where it would be windy and cold. I was already cold....
I had a few issues in breaking down camp. First, I ripped two of the tent ties that hook onto my stakes trying to pull the tent stakes out of the frozen ground. Fortunately I figured out a much better and easier way to do this, using one stake as a lever to loosen the other. Second, my socks and boots were frozen solid. I took a picture of my socks and uploaded it because they were so rigid it was comical. They were like 4 day old roadkill carcasses that had baked in the sun and turned to rawhide. I made the call to wear the socks I normally just sleep in since I would be doing laundry at the hostel tonight. I still couldn’t get my feet in my boots though. I took them to the parking lot and stumbled around like a hobo in them with my other gear strewn apart. Some guys with photography equipment wee casting glances my way. I’m sure I looked quite mentally stable doing this dance, cursing at my shoes, snot freely flowing from my nose. There’s a guy you can trust! I took my boots into the small bathroom in the parking lot where it was at least a little warmer and jumped up and down on them in my crocs. I was then able to force my feet in, albeit uncomfortably. I walked back outside. The photo guys were gone. All of this took time, and I had a fair bit of hiking today. I wanted to check out a side trail to Grassy Bald, which would take me a mile off the AT. Note - the only miles I track and have tracked are the AT miles and the Approach Trail. I don’t track the other stuff, like side trails or walking to towns or hostels. I bet the average thru hiker walks at least an extra hundred miles or so factoring in these side journeys.  
I got going. My feet started hurting, feeling like I was getting frostbite. OUCH! The first 20 minutes were so uncomfortable that I was sure I was going to end up like Finnigan with frostbite. But, then my feet warmed up and they started thawing the shoes and things felt a bit better. I was hungry. I had eaten two packs of oatmeal and one Justin’s peanut butter squeeze pack, and that was all my food for the day. I was empty until resupply. I was feeling pretty low as I climbed up yet more icy trail. It was either ice or mud, and both were slow going in different ways. Ice was just hard to try and find footing. Mud was like doing a weird forwards moon walk - my feet moved but slid back as I took a step, so it took one and a half to two steps just to move a normal distance. 
I got up to Jane Bald and saw the photo guys. I went over to say hello to them and their cute dog Jade. I told them I was a thru hiker (partly to hopefully help put the morning scene into context) and we chatted briefly. They said they heard the weather was really rough this year. While I could not compare, I agreed it had been a challenge. In my head I was thinking and screaming “GO AWAY SNOW AND ICE. BEGONE!”
I headed up from Jane Bald. The wind was painfully cold on my hands, even with windstopper gloves. I alternated holding my trekking poles in one hand and using them like a flawed cane, and putting the other hand in my pocket to warm up. This helped, but was repeatedly foiled as I got to icy patches where I had to use both of my poles. I arrived at the sign for the Grassy Ridge Trail. This was one reason I tented at Carver’s Gap - to check out Grassy Bald. As cold as I was a struggling, it was only an extra mile round trip, so o headed up the ridge trail. I would come back when done and continue on the AT.
For some reason, I felt compelled to bring my pack with me. With no food and little water, it only weighed about 23lbs. As silly as it sounds, it was also a form of safety with so much ice on the trail. If my feet slipped out from under me, it might cushion a bad fall. As the trail got steeper and more icy, I had several close calls slipping and sliding, and started to regret my choice. But Hungry Cat is stubborn and curious and had to see the Grassy Bald! I dropped my pack off not too far from the top and carried on with only my poles. When I got to the top, there was a big plaque on a rock outcrop. The view was beautiful and I walked to the other end to have a look North. I was glad I went  and the itch was scratched. 
I hiked back to my pack and shed my fleece, knowing I would start moving faster so I could get to the hostel in time to do laundry and resupply. And EAT! I went back to the junction with the AT and steered north. The trail was icy and muddy, but I was on a mission from my stomach. I stopped at Stan Murray Shelter  as I saw Nate, Pritch, and Starbucks there. They had all been at Cherry Gap Shelter with me. Pritch and Starbucks were trying to call Harbour Inn to make a reservation. Yes!!  Chances of breakfast were looking good. Nate was still contemplating heading on versus staying st the hostel. I told them about how I had goofed and missed the shelter. They said it was a rough night up there and the shelter wasn’t in great shape anyway. I continued on, working my way through slippery snow, which then turned into ice chunks. It looked like someone had dumped a huge cooler of gas station ice all over the trail. It was really strange. It was also a pain to walk through. I felt a little like I was walking through one of those pens full of colored balls at A Chuck E. Cheese.
I passed by the sign for Overmountain Shelter. I did not go down as it is a bit of a walk and I have been there once before. The Big Yellow Mountain Trail hits the AT here. That passage was used by militia men during the Revolutionary War. The placard was scratched and hard to read, so I am not sure how long it is, but this is a googleable thing.
I carried on and started a steep climb, rewarded by views of the mountains looking back south. I could see Overmountain Shelter, a big red barn, juxtaposed against the white and grey backdrop of the mountains. It was stunning and I took a few pictures. I kept climbing the steep grade. This essentially began a series of long uphills and false summits for Hump Mountain. Every view just got better and better. This lifted my spirits a bit. Despite being hungry and tired, the skies were clear and I was being bombarded by raw beauty. It was incredible! 
When I was at one of the first false summits, I saw a glowing orange jacket. Could it be? Yes it was! With a plastic bag flapping over his pack and him gripping onto two hiking sticks, there stood Tennessee (formerly Bugler), who I had met at the Fontana Hilton. We were both happy to see a friendly face. Both of us were wind torn and had runny noses. We both commented that it was a morale boost to see a familiar face. The wind was so strong that in some places walking up towards each mini summit I almost got blown over. We walked along together for a while and caught up a bit, chatting. I told him about Mountain Harbour, though he seemed like he might just stay on the trail. I finally split off so I could pick up my pace and made it to the real summit. The views were spectacular! Pictures will never do it justice. 
On the back side of Hump Mountain the wind was just as intense as I was still out on the bald. I bounded down, anxious for some relief, and passed by a section hiker named Mike from New Jersey. His trail name is “iiuii,” pronounced ee-ooh-ee. He recognized me from my journal and introduced himself - so cool! He said he tries to do a section a year. He was hiking from Hot Springs to Damascus. I couldn’t help but think that he had drawn the short straw when it came to the weather we’d had. 
I continued on and got off the bald. After another little climb, I reached an area called Doll Flats. It was pretty, green, and had some nice tenting sites. It also had a sign that said leaving North Carolina! I have had one foot in NC and one in TN for a while now, most notably in the Smokies, but this would be goodbye to North Carolina for good! It felt kind of surreal and sad in a way - another state down.
I powered on, determined to complete the descent down to the US 19E road crossing. When I got there, I texted Gillian. We had communicated earlier in the day and I am sure it was clear that I was not in a great mental place. I wanted to let her know I was almost at the hostel, which is 0.3 miles west of the trail / super convenient! I walked alongside the highway and it was like a horrifying wax museum of woodland creatures. Roadkill everywhere!! It reminded me of a trip Gillian and I took to Pompeii in Italy to see the ancient ruins, and molds of people instantly killed by Mt. Vesuvius. Rocky the raccoon was there, frozen in a state of leaping when he had an unfortunate meeting with an 18 wheeler. There was frank the fox - nothing left but his tail! There was also some kind of rodent thing, but it was so bloated and gross I didn’t get a good look. It may have been an opossum. It looked like he had been caught napping by a bulldozer. Needless to say, I had to watch where I walked, but every few steps introduced me to new and more horrifying tale of a creature’s rapid demise. Fun times. It was also startling how fast cars would whiz by me - I haven’t been around traffic for a while now, thankfully!
I walked up to Mountain Harbour and immediately saw a goat. This was auspicious - a harbinger of a tasty breakfast perhaps? I spotted some edible chickweed in their drive and snacked on a handful of trail salad as I walked towards their big barn with an “AT” on it. A hiker worker (work for stay) named Mule (Aaron) greeted me. I went into the general store and he told me the pertinent things. I paid for my bunk and got some snacks - a Yoo-hoo, Reese’s cups, a jumbo honeybun, and an apple. The big red main house was across a fast moving creek and up the hill. It looked gorgeous! Mule showed me the bunkhouse. I was in love! It was very uniquely laid out, super clean and organized - my spirits were quickly lifting. Far Far, a hiker that I met yesterday at Carver’s Gap, and Derwood were here! They had stayed last night and then slack packed today and were staying tonight. They told me the breakfast was awesome. I was giddy inside just thinking about it. I slammed down my snacks and Yoo-hoo and made a quick resupply list. The general store was closed, but Mule had said to go find him at the main house, so I got my wet boots off, set them in front of a fan (good hiker hostels have fans for boots!!), and headed to the main house in my sporty green crocs. I walked in and the house smelled delightful, like a Southern Living cookbook come to life in scents. I met Shannon - she and her husband David are the proprietors. She was super sweet and offered me raspberry strudel leftover from breakfast, and some cookies and coffee. It was all fantastic, but the strudel sent my eyeballs back into the recesses of my skull. In my opinion, it wasn’t just good - it was award winning quality, and I’m not exaggerating because I was really hungry. It really was divine and had just the right blend of sweetness - not over the top. Shannon gave me 3 huge pieces. At that moment, I just wanted to live there forever. I would call Gillian, have her pack her things and grab Lucy the cat and come. We would all live out our days together here, eating raspberry strudel to our hearts’ content. Ahhhhhhh.... I told Shannon about Beaker’s recommendation and she remembered that he had thru hiked last year. She whipped out her 2017 thru hiker yearbook and pulled up his picture. I took in the details of their house as well. Shannon is from Texas, and David was in the Marine Corp. Their house was decorated quite lovely! There were 3 dogs (one was the neighbors) and a cat was sleeping on her desk by her computer. I had seen two other cats at the barn. They sold frozen pizza and Ben and Jerry’s ice cream pints, so I picked out an ice cream flavor for later - Jimmy Fallon inspired “The Tonight Dough.” This was just getting better and better. 
I went back to the general store with Mule and took care of my resupply. As I did, in walked Pritch and Starbucks. Breakfast was definitely happening! I went back inside and got my laundry together. I put my puffy on and used a towel around my waist so I could wash everything. The laundry room was awesome and clean. I put a load in and went upstairs to shower. It felt so good to get warm and clean! There was a scale in the bathroom. I weighed in at 143, down 12lbs from when I started. They had a rack of bath products, and in that rack I saw some aloe, so I put some on my windburned face. They also had Axe body spray. The temptation was too great! So what if I smelled like a fresh 22 year old looking to hit da club? I decided to doll myself up, so I sprayed my pits with Axe and grinned, satisfied, into the mirror. They also had a little thing of Tresseme mousse. Why not!? I rubbed some of that into my hair and I was ready to go, shiny and new! It was a hiker makeover. I was about to hit the catwalk when who came in the door but Tennessee! He had a change of heart and I guess I sold him on it a bit. He was just going to stop by to resupply, but decided he would stay and have breakfast. This was going to be a fun stay! I went down to grab my laundry from the dryer and Nate was there. The whole crew had showed up! We all chatted upstairs as we tended to our various chores. Once I got dressed and put away some laundry, I tended to a few nicks on y fingers and went back to the main house to get my pizza and ice cream. Mule had forgotten to charge me for it, so Shannon went with me down to the general store and rang me up. I went around back by the laundry to the drink machine and got a root beer. I was really excited they had root beer! When I went inside Shannon was chatting with everyone in the common space. Alaska The Last Frontier was on the television. Too funny. 
I went downstairs to cook my pizza in the pizza oven. Two cats were down there, one of which cried until I petted her. I ate my ice cream while the pizza baked, and then when it was done took it all upstairs to eat. It was divine! I gave Tennessee a piece as he looked hungry and I was getting full. After dinner, we took care of organizing our packs and other chores. I had hung my sleeping bag to dry a bit. The top part by my head often gets damp when I sleep buried in it, just from my breathing. I had also dried my tent out. I packed all of that away, and then grabbed some split firewood from outside for the wood burning heater in the bunkhouse. It was time for bed!
Yesterday and today were challenges, but as a friend wisely said to me, “this too shall pass.” Sadly and happily, all of life is ephemeral - the good, the tough, the easy, the hard all come and go. Just as these tough days will pass, so too will the good days, and my time in the trail.
Today I was grateful for the support of my wife when I was feeling frustrated and beaten down. I was grateful for the incredible views and for running into Tennessee and others from the day before. I was super thankful to have come to such a lovely place to stay and fill my belly. Filled with gratitude, I will now dream of filling my face at this famous breakfast that awaits me in the morning!","Carver’s Gap

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585127,"I woke up at 7am. Breakfast was at 8, so I had just enough time to pull my gear and self together so I would be ready to hit the trail after. I had trouble going to sleep last night. I stayed up late journaling and then struggled to fall asleep. I slept soundly once I did though. The fan in the bunkhouse had a nice white noise effect.
We all headed up to breakfast, our spirits high. It was sprinkling ever so lightly, but the forecast today was largely clear.
We got up to the main house and my eyes bulged at the spread! They were just finishing setting it all up, so we grabbed coffee while we waited. Real coffee! I realized I had left my phone charging in the bunkhouse, and was disappointed not to get pictures of the food. I think Pritch at least took a picture of his plate, so maybe I can get that photo from him. From memory, there were: biscuits and gravy, french toast with maple walnut topping, a soufflé, sausage and ham, tomato pie, coconut coffee cake, raspberry strudel, some Easter cookies, potatoes with bits of bacon, pineapple and strawberries. It was an awesome bacchanalia! I ate three plates full of food. Honestly, the quality and craft of David’s cooking was over the top. I felt like I was dining at a fine restaurant! We all talked and enjoyed ourselves, and then thoroughly thanked Shannon and David for their hospitality, and showered David with compliments on the food. God, I wish I could do it again tomorrow. Like I said, soon Gillian and I will be roomies with Shannon and David - they just don’t know it yet.
We left STUFFED!
Beaker Beaker Beaker....huge thanks for the recommendation! If you hadn’t said something, I wouldn’t have known and probably wouldn’t have ended up there. No way another place could possibly top that breakfast! No way. Also, I just really liked the bunkhouse and the friendly, caring vibe there. So far it is easily the best place I’ve stayed on the trail. If any of you are planning a hike through the area, I can’t recommend Harbour Inn highly enough! Off my soapbox....
We set out to hike. Most left before me. Tennessee was hanging around the general store. It was chilly and still s little drizzly, but I was glowing on the inside. I walked back up the highway and turned onto the trail. There were multiple signs warning of leaving cars in the parking lot at the trailhead overnight due to vandalism. There was also a sign about the Golden-Wing Warbler. It said that it is a rare species in Tennessee and they were doing some work on or near the trail to revitalize its habitat to encourage them to breed and thrive. I looked for one today but did not see one. 
I hiked on and soon ran into some of the guys. The hiking today had a few climbs, but for the most part it was pretty average  in terms of difficulty - not too demanding. I hiked with Nate for a while and the trail opened up to a river - the Elk River. It was gorgeous and really the first time the trail had meandered beside a river for any meaningful stretch. 
Everyone was headed towards Moreland Gap Shelter. St one point after just catching up with Starbucks and Pritch, I came around the corner to two volunteers putting a traction wire covering over one of the bridges over the AT. Their names were Kim and Terri and they were volunteers with one of the clubs (I can’t remember which) that does local trail maintenance. The volunteers really are the unsung heroes of the AT. They are the AT - the trail is what you make it, as Ridgerunner Chloe would say. We thanked them for their work, and then Kim said “are you Hungry Cat?” She had been following my trail journal and thought she might catch me hiking through her stretch.  I was tickled that she reads these scribblings. Kim and Terri, it was so nice to meet you! Thank you and the other gents for helping to make the trail beautiful and safe! Shortly after leaving the two ladies, I came upon a group of gentlemen with chainsaws. They were also volunteers and were working to clear hazardous trees that had fallen, or partially fallen. These people were amazing!
I hiked on and pulled away from the others. Hungry Cat was on cruise control, riding the morning’s calories. It was a beautiful day. The drizzle had ceased and it was warm. For the first time in a while, I spent the whole day hiking on dirt - no snow, no ice, no slush! The mud was “just mud.” It was a beautiful thing. The trail was full of stream crossings. After last night, the breakfast, and the good company, I felt like a million bucks. In love with the trail, I hiked my little heart out.
There was nothing especially momentous about the hike today. It just felt good. When I got to Moreland Gap Shelter, there was a Dad. with his two young boys there. They very politely made space. Mike (iiuii) showed up. I had passed him on the trail bit too far back, but he was heading to a hostel about 5 miles away. I chatted and ate a snickers. I almost talked myself into waking another 8 miles to the next shelter, but it was quarter to 5. I laid out my sleeping pad, and then Pritch arrived. He said that his Guthook app showed a camp spot just a little over 2 miles down the trail. I decided to pack up and go with him and Starbucks. I had a 24 mile day planned tomorrow, and that would make it  a shorter day tomorrow. My AWOL guide did not mention campsites at this spot, only water. More and more I am thinking about getting Guthook as a companion to my AWOL guide. 
I went with Starbucks and Pritch, and, sure enough, there was a huge meadow with lots of room for tenting at this spot, and a piped spring. We all pitched our tents. Derwood and Nate showed up. It was a fun night at camp as we chatted and ate our food at mile 415 on the AT. I crossed the 400 mile marker today. 69 to Damascus!  For dinner I had a Knorr Cajun rice side. I added a small packet of olive oil to it. I also ate a tuna packet in sunflower seed oil, an oatmeal cream pie, and a moon pie. Good solid nutrition. 
Today I was grateful for basically everything, but in particular good people, great weather and hiking, dry boots at the end of the day, and a smashing breakfast to kick it all off. Tomorrow is another day for this Hungry Cat! Tomorrow is also Mrs.Hungry Cat’s birthday! I hate missing that but will be excited to find a signal and talk with Gillian because, well, she’s just the best!","US 19E Road Crossing / Harbour Inn
",Stealth Campsite at AT mile 415.4,"Mar 27, Tue",20.60
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585352,"Today was a big day - a lot of plugging along. We all bustled about camp in the morning. The campsite was in a large field, so there was lots of room. Pritch and Starbucks left camp first, then me, and then Durwood and Nate (note that I was spelling Durwood’s name with an “e” before, but found out that was not correct). I started the morning in pants and my long sleeve smart wool. I started climbing the first ridge and found a good cell signal, so I stopped to give my wife a ring and wish her a happy birthday. I was also getting very excited as she is coming to meet me in Damascus! We chatted for a bit and then I continued to hike.
It wasn’t too long before I started getting hot. This is a thing for me on the trail. In the mornings when it is chilly I know that I will need to wear cooler clothes for hiking because I will get warm quickly, but often I just can’t deal with being cold while I make breakfast and pack up camp. Usually it just means I have to stop and remove a jacket. Today it meant the full monty. I was hiking in my long sleeve smart wool and pants. A lot of times I will just zip down the quarter zip and roll up the sleeves of my shirt, and then for the pants I can roll them up and snap them in place like capris. That wasn’t going to cut it today. I was already starting to sweat and I could tell it was going to be a hot one, so I decided to pull over to change. Fortunately, I found a rock outcrop with a beautiful view to do so! I stripped off all of my clothes until I was just standing naked on the rock. I’m not really sure why I did that, rather than one layer at a time, but I did. It felt kind of exhilarating just standing  there on a cliff looking at the mountains with it all hanging out! But it got chilly quickly...so I put on my shorts and t-shirt and got back on the trail. I think there is something about nudity in nature that just feels good (assuming I’m not getting eaten alive by flies and mosquitos). My only other experience with this was in Greece. Gillian and I went to Santorini for our honeymoon and there was a clothing optional beach. We were the only ones there (at first), and so I went skinny dipping for the first time in my life. I’m not normally one to do that kind of thing, but it somehow felt awesome! It was almost like some kind of final surrender, an acceptance of my primal self and an acknowledgement to the other matter of the earth that I am matter too, that somehow we are one. And then another guy showed up and took his pants off nearby and the feeling faded, so I got dressed and we left. I did have a moment though!
I hiked on, climbing up the trail as it skirted White Rocks Mountain, and then descended into a rocky, lush valley. Along the way I spotted little tiny red flowers on some lichen and took a picture. I am emailing these to my Mom now, who has a book on AT flora and is my official Sherlock Holmes of plant and flower identification. She said this one is called British Soldier lichen (named after the red coats) and the flowers used to be used for dyes. I took a picture for my gallery. When I arrived in the valley, I stopped to filter some water. I turned around and there stood Durwood. He startled me, namely because I couldn’t hear him coming over the sound of the babbling stream. We chatted for a minute. Durwood always says he’s “good for one trail tantrum a day.” It makes me chuckle and reminds me of my time tenting by the poop house at Carver’s Gap, jumping on my boots in that dirty bathroom. Durwood moved on, but I caught up with him later at Laurel Falls, which was a breathtaking waterfall. It looked to be about 50 feet tall, and the mist from its forcefully plunging volume left a damp coolness in the air around us, even as the trail skirted the falls and headed away from it. The climb down had been technical and rocky - slow going for fear of injury - so it was nice to get some trail air conditioning from the falls. The trail then funneled into a shelf-like passage that was seemingly carved between the Laurel river and the face of a cliff. I tried to get an action shot of Durwood coming around the corner of the cliff, but pictures just can’t capture these scenes. I think about this a lot. I take a plethora of photos, many more than I upload to this journal, and I love to look at them and I’m sure I will look back at them fondly. My mind’s eye is always better though. The memories of what I saw encapsulate how I felt at the time. My photos help to elicit those feelings. I’m sure that’s why I often like my own photos more than other people do. They can prompt those memories and feelings in me, but they cannot store the same for others.
We walked on at separate paces. I passed by an old barn or shack and then crossed over Dennis Cove Road. There has been quite a bit of discussion about the Kincora hostel off of that road. It’s a hostel stay by way of donation, but apparently it is in really bad shape. Hiker iiuii stayed there and said it was overrun with cats, smelled of cat urine and generally it was pretty filthy and worn down. It sounded like maybe the proprietor just needed a little help, or maybe the donation model wasn’t working out. I was glad that I did not plan to stay there!
I passed a side trail into Hampton, TN. It’s only one mile long, but I didn’t want or need to go into a town so I pushed on. I knew Nate was planning to run into town for some food. It was a good idea actually, but not in my plan. The trail was beckoning me to stay, so I started the 1700 foot climb up to Pond Flats, and just as quickly started the same descent on the other side, down to a bit of road walking over to Watauga Lake. 
The trail skirted the lake, which was quite pretty. This area had lots of bear activity warnings, so many so that it was a little disturbing. I half expected that a bear might suddenly walk out from behind a tree, dressed in a tux with a monocle and say in a cockney accent: “by Jove it’s getting hot I say, isn’t it? Have you another one of those snickers biscuits for me good fellow?” I don’t know why, but in my head the bears there are British gentlemen (you’re welcome Shane Carlson). The Watauga Shelter was even closed due to bear activity and Pritch would later tell me that some of the signs even restricted hiking to authorized personnel and thru hikers only - the two types of people that taste best to bears I guess. I walked on and looked for bears. Nada!
Today’s song on my mind was Billy Joel’s “New York State of Mind,” so I sang that aloud as I walked alone around the lake. It’s a little ironic because the song is basically about how he’s ok with taking little vacations, but in the end he needs the regular beat of the city. He says “been high in the Rockies, under the evergreens. I know what I’m needing and I don’t want to waste more time; I’m in a New York State of Mind.” I could relate in that I have definitely been to “vacation only” places, where it’s fine for a week but not forever. I couldn’t relate out here though. I think my song would be the opposite. I’m in an Appalachia state of mind! Is probably have to explain that a bit though.... later in the refrain of his song though, Billy says “ it comes down to reality, and it’s fine with me cause I’ve let it slide.” I wondered about that. Was he saying that he accepted that it was ok to like “home” more than perhaps more exotic places, and therefore want to go back? Or was he saying that there were other circumstances there that he was doing nothing to change, and so he just accepted that he was “stuck.” It wasn’t clear. I thought to myself that I hoped that I would not let things slide, that I would not settle as long as I could make a change, but that I would be able to accept the realities that I cannot change and coexist peacefully with them. Making a change that I could make was my first step on this journey, even before I took one step on the actual trail. I sang and walked.
The trail finally curved around and crossed over Watauga dam. I saw a hiker in the distance and took a picture of him or her crossing over the dam. After about 30 minutes I caught up to said hiker - it was a guy named Choo Choo. In my not at all awkward style I said something like “I got a pretty cool picture of you crossing over the dam while you weren’t looking, do you want it?” Classic Hungry Cat. Choo Choo was cool though and didn’t seem phased. He is hiking alone too - we don’t often get photos of ourselves that are natural, in the moment shots. I texted it to him. 
I passed Choo Choo and continued on, finally catching up to Pritch and Starbucks. They were talking with a lady named Caroline who was a local out day hiking with her cute chocolate lab Kona. Pritch handed me an orange from his pack. Caroline had just given them oranges and he had an extra. Awesome! I love refreshing citrus trail magic! I thanked  Caroline (and Pritch for sharing). Caroline and I had a brief conversation about the merits of gaiters and then I hiked on.
Originally I had planned to stop at Vandeventer Shelter, but when we arrived there really weren’t any great tenting spots. I didn’t really feel like sleeping in the shelter, so I decided to push on. The next listed campsite was 3.8 miles away. I was convinced there would be a good stealth spot before that, so I pushed on planning to find something a mile or two down the ridge.
3.8 miles later, I arrived at the campsite. Once again, the trail reminds me that my will holds no weight in the real world. I passed a few pseudo stealth sites, but they were quite exposed to the windy gusts of the ridge line, so I continued until I found the charted site just as it was getting dark. I had the place all to myself, and while I love the camaraderie of other hikers, sometimes it’s just nice to be alone in the woods. My will had pushed the day longer than expected, and with the warmer temperatures, I had gotten blisters on both heels. The one on my left heel was bigger. I lanced and drained it. I would tape it in the morning. The blister on my right heel was tiny. I decided to let that one stay intact. This decision would come back to haunt me.
I hung my food bag (successfully!), ate my dinner in the dark by way of my headlamp, got in bag and fell fast asleep to the sound of wind in the trees. I was grateful for the ridge line views, the trail tour around Watauga Lake, good trail talk with other hikers,  Caroline’s and Kona’s thoughtful trail magic, and the solitude and peacefulness of my woodland motel room for the night. I am also continually grateful to all of you who sign my guest book. I know I don’t address all of the comments, but I read and appreciate them all. I think a lot of folks believe that walking the AT is a solitary experience. That has not been my experience at all! Sure, I walk alone for most of my time, but in many ways I am not walking north; I am being carried north by an army of support, trail magic, and my higher trail power who puts me where I need to be. If you’re in the guest book, or even reading this, you’re part of that army, and I’m grateful for that.  Now if you can just help me walk without more blisters ... ;-)","Stealth Campsite at AT mile 415.4

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585512,"The peace and quiet of my camping spot allowed me to “sleep in.” I didn’t wake up until 7:30 or so, when it was light out, with the exception of needing to exit my tent briefly at 5 to empty my tiny bladder. I woke to little birds singing their morning greetings. That is one of my favorite things about sleeping outside. 
The air was cool and crisp, but not cold. It felt like it was about 50 degrees. I tidied up my gear inside my tent, and then set about taping my feet up for the day. I had left the tape off of my blisters overnight to let them drain and breathe. I put two layers of Leuko tape over both of them, and then affixed moleskin on top of that for extra padding. Leuko tape is awesome stuff and stays put, but it is thin and so sometimes, depending on where the hotspot is, I ass moleskin for extra abrasion protection. At this point, the blister on my left heel was drained and wrapped, but a little raw, and the one in y right heel was tiny so I did not drain it, I just wrapped it. Yesterday I had felt that one getting hot and wished I had stopped immediately to deal with it. I thought another quarter mile wouldn’t make a difference, but it was enough to form that tiny blister. I will also note that with the other blister, I didn’t really feel a hotspot until it was too late. Maybe I was just so focused on hiking; it’s hard for me to say. 
I exited my mobile comfort inn and got my stove set up to boil water while I broke down my tent.  Before I could even start on my tent, a hiker appeared. It was one of the German brothers O had met the day before. I didn’t know his name. He waved and said hello as he flew by. Not too long after that as I sipped on my morning coffee, I heard someone coming up on the trail. It was Starbucks. He said they ended up tenting next to Vandeventer Shelter, and he kept on trekking. Watching Starbucks hike reminds me of the pictures of Yeti with that long, split stride. Starbucks is quite tall - maybe 6’5” - and each stride that he takes just looks massive to me. I think his stride is the entire length of my body. It’s pretty impressive. I continue sipping my coffee and start to put away my camp kitchen. I ate oatmeal, pop tarts, and a little peanut butter. Shortly after that while I putting everything in its place in my bag, Pritch sauntered up. He was stopping to get water. I hadn’t gotten a good look in the dark the night before, but the spring at this campsite was quite good. Pritch said they planned to hike to Abingdon Gap shelter, the last shelter before Damascus and about 10 miles out from the town. My plan was to at least make it there, but I really wanted to hike within a few miles of Damascus and camp. I wanted Friday morning to be easy so that I could have a nero, and then a zero, before heading out. Oh Hungry Cat, you’re still trying to make your own plans  and push and push instead of listening to the trail! Silly cat - you know something is coming when you do that! Something was coming.... As the saying goes, curiosity kills the cat. For this cat it’s more like stubborn determination!
Choo Choo showed up to get water as Pritch was heading out. I chatted with him about my plans and he headed out just as the other German kid showed up. I brushed my teeth and that kid headed on. I got my pack all situated and set, and then started hiking. I tend to be kind of slow getting out of camp in the mornings. I don’t like to rush, and I really like making sure my pack is set up for the day and I haven’t forgotten anything, so I tend to go through the same routine. 
Not too long after I ran into German kid #2. I learned that his name is Finn and his fast friend (German kid #1) is actually his brother, Izzy. I continue to be impressed with the number of Germans I am meeting in the trail, as well as their level of fitness. I believe Finn said they were from a town not too far from Hamburg, which is way up north near Denmark. I have been to Germany before, but to Munich and the Bavaria region down south. Thinking about this made my mind wander, planning a future trip to Germany with Gillian.
I passed Finn and hiked on. Today was going to be a lot of ridge line heading towards the Tennessee-Virginia border. I passed Turkeypen Gap and a small gap clearing with power lines. I cruised by Iron Mountain Shelter and dropped in elevation a bit to a series of footbridges over a kind of soggy area. I wouldn’t call it a bog, but there is definitely a reason that trail caretakers out the footbridges there as it looked like it could really flood out. I enjoyed hopping from one to the next. The AT footbridges have a beautiful woodland aesthetic all to themselves that I really love. 
I soon passed Pritch and Choo Choo. When I passed Pritch, I saw a bright orange wrapper on the ground up ahead in front of me behind a small log pile. I went over to pick it up. It was a KitKat wrapper. Delicious! Alas, no KitKat was inside. I grabbed it and kept walking. After about 30 seconds I heard Pritch calling my name. “Hungry Cat! Hey Hungry Cat! You’re going the wrong way!” I looked down and it seemed like I was on the trail. I didn’t see a white blaze ahead, but they can be sparse sometimes. I yelled back “are you sure?” I didn’t want to unnecessary walk backwards. Pritch’s answer was classic: “well, you stepped over a whole pile of logs designed to warn people that the path you’re on is not the trail, and there are white blazes this way.” It was funny and I was so glad he was behind me to catch me before I went too far. I guess in just focusing on grabbing the candy wrapper I didn’t pay attention. If Pritch didn’t catch me, I might have had a much longer day. Maybe there was something to this Guthook app after all I thought.... This wouldn’t be the last time today that I would contemplate purchasing Guthook. 
I hiked on and crossed a road, and the trail passed through a gate into a beautiful farm pasture. This was the outskirts of Shady Valley, TN. The sun was shining and it was just gorgeous how the trail meandered up through the pasture, past an old classic truck and a wooden barn with the AT symbol painted on it. My spirits were high and I took some photos of the barn and views of Shady Valley in the distance over the rolling hills. I saw a person sitting on a bench in the distance up ahead. It took me a while to get to him as I kept stopping to look and take pictures. When I got to the bench I met Mark. I believe he said he was from Michigan. He was driving south to visit someone and stopped to hike up from the road and take in the incredible view. The panorama of Shady Valley and the surrounding mountains from the bench was breathtaking, so Mark pretty much had the best seat in the house. He said it was the first time he had set foot on the AT. I felt really lucky to bump into him st the moment he was getting such an awesome first impression of the trail via the Shady Valley microcosm. 
After a bit I came to a small but lively spring. I needed water and there was a campsite ring nearby with a rock that actually looked like a chair, so this seemed like a perfect place to take a break for lunch. I sat down in my chair rock and pulled off my boots, socks, and sock liners. Everything seemed as ok as it could be on the blister front. I let my feet and socks air out in the sun as I ate a tuna packet. Pritch showed up and grabbed some water, and then Starbucks appeared. What?! I was confused because I never passed him. I told him that I thought he was way ahead of me. He said that he had gone down the same wrong trail as I, apparently for a while before he thought to check Guthook. While he was farther down that trail Pritch was setting me back on course. He stopped to grab some water as I changed out my sock liners for fresh ones and put my socks and boots back on. He and Pritch discussed calling around later to try and reserve a room in Damascus, and then they headed out. I filtered some water and went to grab my pack as Choo Choo rolled in. He stopped to get water and I pushed on, feeling rested and satisfied from my lunch break.
I kept on hiking and, despite the relatively forgiving elevation profile, I could feel the miles start to wear on me as I got to McQueen’s Knob. There was what looked to be a shelter there and I thought maybe I was at Abingdon Shelter, but it was quite small and really run down. I picked up my pace as it was late afternoon and I knew I had 7 miles to go after I reached the shelter to get to a campsite approximately 2 miles outside of Damascus. That was my goal - a long day and then an easy Friday morning stroll in Damascus. My wife Gillian was coming into Damascus to spend the weekend with me and I figured I could get in early, eat some breakfast, and maybe do some chores and clean up a bit before she got in. I was motivated and excited to get there!
I kept on trucking and after a while reached the actual Abingdon Shelter. My heart sank a little as I was not as far along as I expected. I knew the campsite I was targeting did not have water close by. My AWOL guide said the water was about .4 miles away from the campsite. I decided to chug some water here to hydrate and then filter more. The shelter was tarped off, so I walked around inside and an older gentleman was lying there in his sleeping bag. He sat up with wide eyes. He had a long white beard and was quite thin. He seemed rather peppy and said that I hadn’t disturbed him, he was just kind of resting there waiting for dark. He introduced himself as Loner Boner. I backed up a few inches and he must have noticed because he quickly added that his actual name was Lee Boner. What a trail name! Yikes.... Anyway, he was very friendly and said he was 77 years old and thru hiking. He knew he couldn’t make it to Damascus that day so he decided to pull over at the shelter as the forecast called for rain that night. He told me the water source there was good, but that it was 300 yards down a hill. That it was.... I hustled down and filtered two liters. There were a surprising amount of flies dancing around my face while I did this. I also bagged another liter of dirty water to filter later at camp. That would give me plenty to do some chores,like brush my teeth and give my filter a serious back flushing that it needed. It would mean a bit of extra weight, but it was only 7-8 miles more right?
As I got close the top of the hill by the shelter I saw Choo Choo headed my way to get water. He told me he was going to stop there for the day and hike 10 miles into Damascus in the morning. I quickly ate a snack and pressed on. At this point I might have noticed some pain in my feet, more specifically my blister areas, but I really don’t remember. I was hell bent on getting to that campsite, so I kept going at a rapid clip. It was approaching 7:15 or 7:30 when I suddenly felt a hot stinging pain in my right heel. All of a sudden it felt like loose skin was dragging back and forth. The sting was powerful and I started to hobble. I really could not tell what was going on and I wanted to just keep walking. I had to be close to the TN-VA border, and then the campsite was 0.6 miles from the border. I tried to push on, but it burned so badly that I had to stop and check the damage. Meanwhile, the wind had picked up and I could see some dark clouds rolling in. It was supposed to rain all night with gusty winds, and all I knew was that the forecast said it would start “after 8.” It was 7:30.... I pulled my right boot off and the tape and moleskin I had put in place was still there; however, I could see that the blister it once covered had expanded user it, and mist have just burst as the tape was wet with fluid. I guess the good news was that it was still covered. The bad news was that I had a few miles left to go. There was nothing much I could do then but put y boot back on and keep going. I favored my heels (my left one was beginning to get uncomfortable now as well),which meant I was walking unnaturally and making my feet sore. I finally got to the border sign, which picked up my spirits. I took a quick picture straddling the states, and carried on. My AWOL guide said I only had 0.6 more miles, and there was water 0.4 miles after the campsite. I didn’t need the water as I was carrying it, but it was good to know anyway. I walked and walked and walked. I stopped to get out my headlamp. Something felt wrong. I must’ve gone half a mile by now! Right??? I asked myself this question. It was getting dark and I could feel the storms closing in. I took off my bag again and re-consulted the guide. 0.6 miles. Maybe I was just tired? It must be around the bend any minute now. I tiredly dragged my pack back on, turned on my headlamp and walked into the growing darkness.
I started to feel like I was in a dream. I felt a little like Alice through her looking glass, finding myself in some weird netherworld. It was like my own Stranger Things upside down, only without the terror of a demogorgon. I plodded on and still nothing. I started to think maybe I had missed it. I wished I had Guthook so I could at least see how close I was. This was it - the final straw. I vowed to get Guthook if WiFi in Damascus was good. It was a small price to pay for more assurance in navigation. I kept going, shining my light figuring that if I had accidentally passed the campsite I would see the blue blaze water trail 0.4 miles later. Still nothing! The wind was picking up and it felt like the sky could open up at any moment. I had to pee. Dang bladder!!! Gah! I pulled over and winced as my heel reminded me of its need for attention. A crosswind whipped in, redirecting my urine  stream onto my boot. Awesome....
I kept picking my way forward on the trail, and came to a juncture where the trail seemed to split in two with no blazes. Oh boy.... I picked the left fork as it seemed to be more likely correct. I am not sure why I felt that way, but without Guthook I could not check. I drove myself forward, akin to pushing a shopping cart with a wonky wheel. Finally I saw a blaze - thank goodness! And then I saw a clearing up ahead. The campsite! I had arrived, though how far I walked I had no idea, other than it felt closer to two miles than 0.4. 
I texted Gillian that I was there since I had a cell signal and immediately rushed to set up camp in the dark. The wind played games with me as I set up my tent. No rain yet! I threw my pack inside it and looked around for a tree to hang my food bag. The only option I saw was directly over the trail. Was that even kosher? I guess if it is high enough, it doesn’t matter, and I would be up in the morning anyway to take it down. I decided I’d better make dinner first before it started raining. I boiled water and set my Knorr rice side cooking in my cook pouch. I made Cajun dirty rice, which I love. I filtered the rest of my water while the rice finished cooking, and then started shoveling rice in my mouth. Plop, plop, Plop, PLOP! The rain was starting. It had a slow and growing cadence to it, so I knew I didn’t have long. Unlike with breakfast, I never eat dinner in or too close to my tent. I tried to eat faster.  The rain came harder. I finished the rice side and scrambled to get my cook gear together and in my tent. I grabbed my toothbrush and hurriedly scrubbed my fuzzy whites. The heavens opened up. I dove back into my tent with my food bag. The rain pelted the outside of my tent, the wind steering it left, right, then up and down. It was like sitting in my car going through a car wash. I needed to hang my food bag, but I didn’t want to get soaked. I was sitting half in my tent, with my legs sticking out in the vestibule as I still had my boots on. I decided to work on my feet. I slipped my boots off and brought my legs inside the tent. A small beetle had made his way into the tent and was running around confused. “I know how you feel” I thought. I picked him up and placed him outside. Find your campsite man! I bet beetles don’t get blisters. I pulled off my socks to get a closer look.
I removed the tape on my right foot and it came off painfully, namely because the blister had enlarged and burst underneath it, so the tape was now pulling at that loose skin. The skin underneath it was red and raw. The area was pretty large - not good. I inspected the left foot and, despite  lancing that blister and taping it, it had semi reformed and enlarged. This was going to be fun. I worked on draining what was left in both. Then came my moment of joy. I knew I had to sanitize them. I grabbed a sanitizing wipe from my first aid kit. I wished I had something to bite down on. Maybe not a stick as that would be gross. Maybe a big handful of red vines, so that as I bit down in pain I would get a candy surprise. I think the medical field should consider this strategy. Anyway, I grabbed the towelette wipe and did what I had to do. There is a sick part of me that kind of enjoys the excitement of The Lapse. What is The Lapse you ask? The Lapse is the short, and never certain, time period from when you press an antiseptic onto a wound until you actually feel that searing, burning pain. That’s The Lapse. It’s a little thrilling, but I definitely do not enjoy the feeling after. I winced as I felt the burn, knowing only that I had to do it again on the other side.
When that was done, I put bandaids over them so that they could breathe a little overnight. I popped two Vitamin i, put away my kit and stripped down to my underwear. My feet throbbed, but I was tired and knew I would fall asleep. But wait - my food bag! I still had to hang that. It was pouring outside, and in a moment of controversial hiker-tired decision making, I decided to risk it. I was pretty sure I wasn’t in a high bear activity area, I was close to town, and maybe mice don’t like to chew through tents in the rain? I was so tired and beaten down that I decided just to seal it all up as best I could and bury it in my pack, and then leave my filthy stinking hiking shirt in the outside of my pack to maybe mask any potentially tasty smells. I knew this was a risk, but I just couldn’t bear the thought of getting soaked hanging that bag in the dark. I woke a few times during the night and talked loudly, convinced that  raccoons were chewing through my tent for the KitKat wrapper I had picked up that day. My sleep was restless, but I was close to Damascus, and therefore close to my love, whom I had not seen in over two fortnights. As a quick aside, I’m aware that fortnight is a rather polarizing word. Some love it for its classic flavor, and others hate it claiming it is outdated and pretentious. I love it because both schools are correct! 
Today was long and the trail had to put me in my place. As I fell asleep I realized I was pushing too hard; I had focused on setting up the schedule I wanted, rather than what the trail would supply for me. I could have stopped at Abingdon, but I did not. Was Loner Boner a trail test that I failed? Probably. I probably flunked the Loner Boner trail quiz, whistling away with my will the size of a large, floating zeppelin, pulling me along without observation or conscience. I was grateful to be able to see this though. At least I am a person who can recognize a lesson now, even if I’m late to the party. I was grateful to be in my tent with the storm safely outside, dry and warm. More than anything, I was excited beyond belief to see my wife tomorrow. I would actually see her! The whole situation seemed surreal. I was actually thru hiking. I was almost to Damascus. I would see Gillian in less than 24 hours. Tomorrow was going to be huge in multiple ways.","Campsite at mile 441

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585523,"When I woke, the heavy rain was gone and there was a light mist in camp. It was light outside - almost 8am. I had slept hard from exhaustion. The first thing I did was inspect to see if any woodland creatures tried to chew through my tent to get at my food bag. Whew! All was intact there, though I knew this was a risky gamble and that I was lucky. I made a mental vow not to repeat this if at all possible. 
I shoveled a pop tart into my mouth and packed up camp. I packed up a bit sloppily, in a hurry to get into town. I knew I could rearrange and clean gear at the inn Gillian and I were staying at - the Hikers Inn, on Laurel Street. It is both inn and hostel, run by a previous thru hiker Paul and his partner Lee. I taped up my feet as best I could. I knew I needed to look at my heels more closely in town and take care of them. I stuffed my wet tent in the outside mesh pocket of my bag and started in. The very first thing I saw as I exited camp was the blue blazed water trail. What?! The AWOL Guide had said it was 0.4 miles from camp, but this clearly was right at camp. That meant I had probably at least walked a mile, rather than the 0.6 last the border that AWOL suggested the campsite was. I vowed to download Guthook and check this. I hobbled along, trying to land on the balls of my feet and stay off my heels. It was painful and slow going. I looked like a wounded leprechaun, scurrying with a frenetic look and hampered stride. Frenetic is a good word for me in this moment, because the Latin root of this word means “delirious,” and I was a little tired and out of sorts. Even better though, the Latin word was actually derived from a Greek root, which translated as “inflammation of the brain.” That’s probably more aptly descriptive of my then current state. My feet hurt, I was tired and dirty, and all I could think about was breakfast and Gillian. 
The mist started to turn into light rain, so I put my rain hood up. A day hiker passed me in running attire. She looked freshly showered and stylish in her clothes. I said hello and I think I noticed her flinch a bit. I probably had dirt or boogers, or both, all over my face. I kept going, relying heavily on my trekking poles. Gillian ya yes me that she would probably arrive around 2:45pm. I figured I would use that time to get some food and knock out some in-town to-do’s. The rain picked up even more as I dropped out of the woods seemingly into the backyard of two houses. The AT enters Damascus in a residential area. I followed it to the street as the rain came down, crossed the street and made my way towards an arch. It was a welcome to Damascus arch! I loved it. Damascus is such a huge initial goal for thru hikers. It marks the completion of the Smokies, 3 States, and almost 500 miles of trail. The biblical undertones of the town name layer nicely under its symbolic status as a trail town. Waking under that arch to follow the trail into town was a glorious experience, regardless of the rain! It was a threshold that I had thought little about, and now here it was before me and it made me think about so much. Obviously I thought about seeing Gillian, but not so obviously it really hammered home the fact that I was actually on this journey. This wasn’t just a Dream. I was doing this. I know that sounds crazy, but when I started hiking in Georgia on Feb 26, all I had to do was just keep going, so that’s what I did. One day at a time I put one foot in front of the other. Now, I suddenly became aware of how far I had come. It was kind of awesome!
I crossed under the arch and couldn’t help but feel like I was going through some kind of small transformation. 
The trail weaved through the town square park alongside a swiftly moving and beautiful creek. It then took a right turn into the street, and I walked past some shops and an outfitter store. Like Hot Springs, there was a nice AT marker in the sidewalk, with bricks around it that appeared to have the names of hikers on them. Maybe it is the Hollywood walk of fame for hikers! I’m not sure. I walked on along Laurel Avenue past Shady Street to the Hikers Inn. Damascus covers miles 469.3 to 470.9, roughly, and Hikers in is probably around 470.2, so I used 470 to make it easy for the morning mileage. 
I got to the inn, which was a very cute white household with a wrap around front Porch right off of Laurel. I set my pack down on the porch and went inside. It was about 9:30/9:45, so I figured the room wasn’t ready. I saw a man and a woman inside the inn. I asked if they worked there and they did not. They were fellow thru hikers who had started their hike in Valentine’s day. Their names were Lucky 59 and Pepper Pot. Lucky 59 was born in ‘59 and is 59 years old, plus she was already retired, hence her name. Pepper Pot, her husband, was from Guyana. Apparently pepper pot is a traditional dish there and he has been craving it and talking about it enough to make it his trail name! They said Paul wasn’t at the inn right then, but there was a phone and sign to call if he was not there, so I went outside and called. Paul said he was out at breakfast and that the room wasn’t quite ready, but that I could set my stuff inside and he would be back soon if I wanted to shower. I told him good was my first mission. He informed me that Mojo’s cafe had good food and was really the only place in town that was open besides Pizza Plus, a chain pizza restaurant. In fact, Paul was at Mojo’s. I set my stuff inside and headed that way. There is a trail that is 30+ miles long that runs through Damascus called the Virginia Creeper trail. It’s popular with cyclists and brings a lot of tourism business to Damascus. I walked along the creeper trail in my rain jacket, shorts, and boots towards Mojo’s. As I crossed a lovely bridge across a creek, two gentlemen we’re headed my way. One of them asked if I was Kevin and introduced himself as Paul. Small town! I now had a face to go with the name and voice. I moseyed on around the bend to Mojo’s cafe.
I walked in and instantly loved it. I ordered huevos rancheros and a coffee and sat down. The WiFi was excellent, so I sucked it up and purchased and downloaded the Guthook app and guide for the AT. I knew this would be very useful moving forward. It’s not that expensive; I was just trying to avoid having more technology on my trek. Funny enough, I took advantage of the WiFi to check some emails, update some apps, and backup my photos. :-)
The huevos rancheros, served over jalapeño cornbread, were awesome! I ate those and then got s piece of lemon blueberry zucchini cake with cream cheese frosting. It made my eyes roll into the back of my skull it was so good. First the food at Harbour Inn, and now this! I found out that the owner/chef’s mom made the cake. It was just spectacular!
I sat around drinking coffee and before I knew it, lunchtime arrived! I spent time looking at resupply options and thinking through how much food I might need to procure. For lunch I ordered a breakfast pizza, which was basically eggs and delicious things on a flatbread. Again, it was delicious! I had one more cup of coffee and then headed back toward the inn. I took a detour through two of the outfitters and the Dollar General just to see what kind of things and food were available for resupply. There was also a larger grocery store, Food City, nearby. 
When I got back to the Inn Paul showed me to the room and showed me the ropes. The Inn was really nice and quaint! I loved it and new Gillian would as well. I took my wet tent and pack cover out back to hang to dry, and upstairs laid out my sleeping pad and bag to reorganize back into my pack later. I got my cool gear out to clean and brushed my teeth. Paul said they did laundry for $5, but I decided to wait until Gillian was there to hand it over since I knew she was bringing some “normal” clothes for me to wear. I decided to take a look at my feet. They were gnarly! Skin was hanging off the oozing blisters, so I cut some of it away so they could drain and dry. In hindsight, I need to get more precise about how I drain and treat blisters. I probably cut too much of the dead skin away, but at the time I just thought the quickest path to healing was to expose the wound so it could dry. I took some time to trim up my nails as well and tried to wash some of the ingrained dirt out of my hands. I heard the door downstairs open. She was here!
I hadn’t showered yet, but I didn’t smell that bad. I ran downstairs and hugged my wife at the door. Gillian was definitely a sight for sore eyes! It was so good to be together again, but also so surreal. It’s hard to describe. I wanted to know how she was doing and hear everything and tell her everything all at once! It was really just incredible to have her here. She brought a lot of stuff with her, and one of the first things she said was “I hope you haven’t resupplied yet!” 
She brought me “street clothes,” as well as a resupply box I had prepped before I left with refills of things like Leuko tape. She also brought some other stuff, like deodorant and whatnot. She had made an army of cookies - mint chocolate chip and oatmeal peanut butter chocolate chip - and bagged them in fours so that I could have some, but so that we could hand them out as trail magic. Fun! They were delicious too! I immediately ate a few. She also came in tow with a huge care package that my parents had put together, with tons of useful trail meals and snacks and other various items, such as new socks and liners (it was really too much guys, but THANK YOU!). I realized I had worn a hole in one of my sock liners, so that gift was particularly timely. I was very grateful for these things and it made me miss my family even more. 
I got showered up and put on my non Hungry Cat clothes and some actual deodorant. It felt pretty amazing. Gillian probably almost vomited looking at my feet. I ran out of bandaids, but Paul gave me a couple. I just wanted to lightly cover them for now so they could dry out. Gillian walked next to me the way you might walk next to a very old grandparent with mobility issues. I was painfully slow shuffling along in my crocs, trying to keep my heels from banging into the ridges st the back. My feet were quite sore too from walking on them differently to compensate. Nevertheless we were having a great time and enjoying each other’s company. We walked into Mojo’s for dinner, and I realized I had spent a good portion of the day there! 
Gillian ordered crab cakes and I got a Greek penne pasta. We also ordered wings as an appetizer. They were the best wings we have ever had! They had such a rich and Smokey flavor, and they were thick and juicy, not tough and over fried. Mojo’s continued to impress! We snagged the last of the blueberry lemon cake and then went back to the Inn, our bellies more than satisfied. 
We caught up on life in general and things that had happened Since a left over a month ago. We talked about how quickly a year of marriage had come and gone, and what a great year it had been. It was beyond a great day, and tomorrow would be another! I was so grateful that Gillian was able to come to see me, for her love and support, as well as that of my parents. I was thankful for such a nice inn to stay at, both since we are celebrating our anniversary and also given the condition of my feet and need for good rest! Most of all I just felt lucky to be with my wife. To be together is the grandest!","Campsite at mile 467

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585586,"Today I woke up next to my lady. The sun was shining and it was a beautiful day in Damascus! We shuffled (I shuffled and hobbled in my “fashion-forward” green crocs) down to Mojo’s for breakfast. Gillian had the huevos rancheros and I had the breakfast quesadilla. We enjoyed our coffee and had brought a bag of cookies that Gillian made in case we saw any hikers to do some mobile trail magic. Gillian bagged them separately in fours after she made them so hikers could just grab a bag easily and not spread germs. She made two kinds of cookies: mint chocolate chip (my favorite) and oatmeal peanut butter chocolate chip. I thought it was awesome and thoughtful that she wanted to do trail magic. We caught two  thru hikers in our magic net at Mojo’s, including a guy named Three Mile whom we talked with for a while. He said he had been hanging with Fresh Ground, a famous trail angel I have yet to meet, just north of here. Fresh Ground apparently goes all along the trail doing trail magic, and sometimes people give him donations to help him sustain his practice. I hope to meet him at some point!  Three Mile was cool and just hanging out so we chatted for a bit about trail stuff - shoes and miles, etc.
After that Gillian and I stopped at the outfitter next door to look (Sundogs), and then went back to the inn. While she showered I got my resupply list together. I put my existing food in daily bags and figured out what I still needed and we went to Food City down the road. It is a pretty large grocery store so they had everything I needed. Then we went back to the Inn and took a stroll down the main street, Laurel Ave. We stopped in an artist’s shop. He was a woodworker who said he ran a lumber business in Massachusetts near Worcester for 30 years, then moved down here with a tractor trailer full of wood. He said goodbye to harsh winters and to mosquitos. Apparently there aren’t really any mosquitos in Damascus, or if there are, they are much less of an issue than what this gentleman was used to dealing with back in Mass. We ambled along down the street and stopped at Mt. Rogers Outfitters, and then went to the town park and sat in the sun for a bit at a picnic table facing one of the creeks that runs through town. It was a beautiful day to be relaxing outside, and we just enjoyed each other’s company. We walked (s l o w l y...) back to the Inn and I soaked my feet in Epsom salts that we picked up at Dollar General along the way. As an aside, it is really easy to lose time in a Dollar General! There are so many random things there and it is so cheap! I finished up some gear organization and we walked back to Mojo’s for dinner. Hello Mojo’s! It’s us again! Of course I donned my green crocs and my street clothes - we were in our finest :-). I had the fish tacos and Gillian had the turkey reuben. Both were excellent, but we also got a side of brussels sprouts as we had heard from Paul at the Inn that they were amazing. “Amazing” and “brussels sprouts” are not usually in the same sentence, but these were cooked with pieces of bacon and caramelized onions in butter, so of course they were incredible. We both got dessert to go. I chose Boston cream pie and Gillian got carrot cake. We took them back to the Inn and steeped rooibos tea downstairs at the common table. We ate and chatted and then went upstairs to wind down and go to bed. 
The day went quickly somehow, even though we just piddled around and chatted a lot. I knew tomorrow would be tough because Gillian would head back to Atlanta around noon, but I was excited that I would be able to have breakfast and the first part of the day with her. My heels are in rough shape. I haven’t mentioned the much, but they are basically open sores as I opened the blisters up to try to get them to dry, since they were already burst anyway. Maybe I cut away too uch of the dead skin. We honestly aren’t sure what the right way to go about it is. At this point, it is what it is and I will just keep them clean and let them dry and heal sufficiently before I get back on the trail. This means I’ll have to take a few zeros after Gillian leaves. I’m not that happy about this as it is hard for me to just sit around, but it is necessary. We have heard too many stories of infections pulling people off the trail. The reality is, Damascus is a great place to hang for a few days and I have everything I need here to recover.
I was so so grateful for my time with Gillian today, the lovely weather we had, and that I am slowly coming to accept that I need to rest. Maybe an old cat can learn new tricks!","Damascus, VA

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585596,"It was hard to wake up this morning. It was Easter Sunday and that meant that Gillian would head back to Atlanta today. Maybe if I shut my eyes it would slow things down and she would somehow stay longer. I wanted to get up though, specifically so we would have as much time together as possible before she left. The more I started thinking about it, the more I wondered if maybe this wast a sign. My heels were in horrible shape. Would I even be able to hike this week? As we got ready for breakfast, I felt more and more like this was a sign that maybe I had had enough, that I should perhaps just look at next year for another section hike. I told Gillian how I felt, and of course she said it was up to me. She told me that only I had to live with the decision and she would support me no matter what. Way back at Fontana, Squatch had said there would come a time when I wanted to quit. It wasn’t so much that I felt like quitting, it just seemed like the right time to be done. That was that. I decided right then that I would live to fight another day and drive back to Atlanta with my wife. I know that will disappoint some of you, but a thru hike is a very physically and mentally taxing challenge. It’s hard to understand if you have not attempted something like this before.
After breakfast, on the way back to Atlanta, I reflected on a lot of things. It was a somber ride as I thought about the trail, how I never had the chance to pass on the trail karma necklace, how I tried to listen to the trail but was stubborn a lot of the time. I felt off. It just wasn’t sitting right, just like writing this ridiculous gibberish isn’t sitting right at the moment, because it’s not true. April fools!! Sorry, I had to........ no, I’m not quitting!! No way! At this point you will have to drag me off the trail. No, this isn’t how the day went. Let me start over.
We woke up and went to Mojo’s, lest they forget their biggest fans, for breakfast. Gillian had the bagel with lox and I had the French quarter omelette and a cinnamon bun. The cinnamon bun was truly incredible! We speculated at how they warmed it up, how they made it. It was like a roll of heaven. After breakfast we went back to the Inn and chatted a bit more, but soon it was time to say our goodbyes. We talked with Lee, one of the inn owners. She and her husband Paul are truly awesome and we were thoroughly enjoying the inn. 
As Gillian drove away back to Atlanta, my heart sank a bit. Suddenly I wanted to flee Damascus. I wanted to keep on hiking. If I’m hiking, I focus on moving, looking, seeing, survival. If I’m sitting in Damascus, well, let’s just say I have a hard time sitting still. I went upstairs to journal and read a bit and felt a little better. I needed the rest. My heels were a mess. Staying in Damascus a few more days would be fine. Yes, I missed Gillian, but I would no matter where I was. I knew she knew I wanted to finish this journey. She knew I hated having to take a break to heal, but that I needed to do it. So I would do it. Get ready Mojo’s - I’m going to be bringing my appetite for a few more days!
I took it easy the rest of the day and researched trail running shoes online. I wanted to put my boots to rest and get into something that would breathe better. My boots were too hot for warmer weather and I feared that was part of the reason for my blisters. Tomorrow I would see about trying on some trail runners at one of the local outfitters.
Mojo’s was closing at 5, so I went around 4 to get something to go. As I walked in I heard someone say “hey Hungry Cat!” I looked over and Transformer, Nomad, and Willow were drinking beer at a table with one other guy I had not met yet. They were surprised to see me thinking I would have gone already, so I told them about my visit with Gillian and then about my heels. They said they were going to go eat at the Pizza Plus pizza buffet. I told them maybe I would see them around the next day. I went back to the counter and I ordered the turkey reuben and a slice of coconut cake to go. I went to pay and realized I had forgotten my wallet. Ugh! I was trying not to walk that much!
I hobbled back to the inn as quickly as I could and grabbed my wallet. I also grabbed Gillian’s trail magic cookies, figuring the hiker crew would still be there when I got back. I shuffled back up the Virginia Creeper trail towards Mojo’s and saw Nomad and crew walking my way. I offered them the rest of the cookies, and they seemed very excited. It felt good to make good use of Gillian’s trail magic, and I knew those guys had been pushing pretty hard and needed the calories. Mission accomplished Gilly! I continued to Mojo’s, where my food was already ready, paid and headed back to the inn. 
Back at the inn I sat alone at the common table and ate my sandwich while reading. I made a cup of rooibos tea to have with my coconut cake. The cake was again incredible. I tried to eat every visible molecule. Then I remembered that I had another treat waiting for me. The night before, Lee and Paul had gone to a potluck and Paul had made chocolate mousse. They had extra and gave Gillian and I each a serving. It was delicious (Paul is quite the cook!). Today, Lee had said she had a bit more leftover and would leave it in the fridge for me. I peeked inside the fridge and, sure enough, there was a little post-it note on a Tupperware that said “Hungry Cat.” Even though I’d just eaten dinner and my cake, I devoured the mousse. It was decadent and wonderful. Gillian messaged me to let me know she had gotten home ok, and that she missed me and our fur kid Lucy the cat was doing fine.
I went upstairs to wind down and thought about how lucky I was to have a supportive wife and that she could come visit me. I was grateful for such a nice inn to at which I could rest and heal. It was quiet and I knew I would sleep well. I did.","Damascus, VA

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585601,"Gooooooood mooooorning Damascus!! Remember that movie Good Morning Vietnam with Robin Williams? I feel like that is my morning Damascus greeting style now, as I become comfortable in town and familiar with the whereabouts of Charlie. I’m like a Damascus concierge now. I can point out the post office, library, the major hostels, the shortcut to Mojo’s. I know which outfitters have the best selection of Mountain House meals and who sells what brand of shoes. I even know Smokey the Cat, a fat grey cat that lives around the corner and makes the rounds getting hand outs from the neighbors. He took a shining to Gillian and followed her for a while on Sunday. I’m like the Charlie Hustle of Damascus. I was called a “regular” at Mojo’s the other day.  
I need to get out of here!!!!!! It’s a great place to rest, but I’m antsy!
I slept in a bit today. Well, I woke up at 7:30, peed, texted Gillian, ate a bag of cookies, and then went back to sleep for an hour or so. Today is my actual wedding anniversary day, so Gillian and I wished each other a happy anniversary from afar. We both commented how quickly the year seemed to go, and what a great year it had been! I stirred back awake and decided to get moving.
Today I was on a mission to try on trail runners. My heels weren’t feeling great, but if I patched them up they would be ok to try on some shoes. It was pouring outside. I patched myself together like Humpty Dumpty,put on my hiking socks and gingerly out my boots on. It was raining to hard to wear crocs. I donned my raincoat and headed to Mojo’s. I would eat, then drop next door to Sundogs, an outfitter, to try on shoes. 
I went into Mojo’s. They probably think I moved here at this point. I ordered huevos rancheros, but they were out, so I went with my backup - the breakfast quesadilla. I also ordered a cinnamon bun because, well, why not? I sipped my coffee and read a little bit on my kindle app. I finished all of that in good time, and went back for a coffee refill and another cinnamon bun. Hungry Cat nom nom nom....
As I sipped on my coffee and read, I saw a familiar face walk past. It was Gazelle, who had hiked with Nomad and crew for quite some time. She was there with her partner, who had hiked a section with her. We caught up a little bit, and then it was time for me to go. I wanted to take care of my shoe fitting business so I could get my shoes off and chillax. 
I wen next door to Sundogs outfitters and set about trying on some trail runners. I quickly realized that my feet had already become a full size bigger. This is common with thru hikers and something I expected, though maybe not so fast! I tried on a bunch of different shoes by different manufacturers. My main goals were comfort and breathability. If I got a breathable shoe, versus something leather or goretex, I knew it would help to speed up the time it would take for my shoes to dry when wet. There is no such thing as a waterproof shoe on the trail. My boots were water resistant, but once they got wet, without some kind of fan they took forever to dry! Going into this exercise I was sure that I would end up with Salomons. I had read reviews on two different types and they seemed really good. I also wanted to try a pair of Brooks Cascadias. The one shoe I didn’t plan to give a chance was Altra. I had tried the times in Atlanta and they did not fit well. The Lone Peak by Altra fit well, but at the time I was convinced it wasn’t “enough shoe” for backpacking. Guess what I ended up getting..... I now own a pair of Altra Lone Peak 3.5s. I just couldn’t get the other shoes to fit as comfortably. I was close with the Salomon Odyssey (or something like that), but I actually liked the lack of slope in the Altras from heel to toe. I felt like it took pressure off my heels. The toe box on the Altras was the only one that didn’t feel like it was somehow pushing my feet into some kind of foot girdle. In the end, it was the best fit and had good breathability, and I had to get out of my boots that were hot, squeezing my swollen feet, and getting worn down. I guess we’ll see how these Altras do. If I hate them, I’ll just have to order different shoes for farther down the trail. Hopefully they will work out! I’m definitely excited to get something lighter on my feet! Brad at Sundogs was super patient with me as I tried on tons of shoes and sizes. I was in there for over an hour. Shoes are everything on the trail. Well, not everything, but almost everything.
After I got this settled, I went back to the inn to get my boots off and get back into my crocs to rest my feet and let my heels get air. I packaged up my boots and my old pair of gaiters (I picked up a new pair in hot springs) and went to the post office to mail them back to Atlanta. I figured it was worth keeping them for later, and worst case maybe I could donate them back home versus just throw them out here. I got to the counter and realized I’d done it again - I forgot my wallet. I shuffled back to the Inn and then back to the post office. Done! It was kind of sad to see those boots go. They had gotten me almost 500 miles - technically over 500 miles counting the approach trail, walking around towns, and side trails, not to mention the couple of years of hiking prior to the AT! 
After the post office I walked down by the old mill conference center. I wanted to see the dam there by the mill. It was a low head dam, meaning it is basically a small dam created by a seamless wall that pools the water but allows it to flow overhead. I know about these structures simply because they are quite dangerous for paddling, and of course swimming. The lack of break in the dam structure creates an unbroken wall of recirculating water at the bottom of the dam. It basically creates a vacuum of recirculation that sucks anything that goes over the dam, or is beneath it, back into it. Lots of people drown in these not knowing of their danger. Anyway, I wanted to have a look. I did, and the. Walked back to an outfitter across from Dollar General to return some Super Feet inserts I had purchased the other day. Once my feet could spread out in the Altra toe box, I realized the super feet inserts would be too narrow and my foot would hang over the ridge. I hoped my feet would be ok without inserts. Reading online, it’s a controversial topic. A lot of runners advocate for zero drop from heel to toe and no inserts. Others say that inserts help to prevent the foot from moving in the shoe. I’ve used them and also not used them. I hope the Altras will be ok without them, because I am not sure if even the super feet wide version (which I would have to order) will fit. I emailed superfeet with the question and after two tries, it’s clear they aren’t going to answer me directly, which tells me that the inserts probably aren’t a great match for Altras. I’ll give it a whirl without them anyway.
I went back to my room and read for a bit, then walked down to subway to get a sub for dinner. Two guys were talking inside. One was a corrections officer at the local prison. The other was asking if they were hiring and whether in was true that they had to get pepper sprayed and tased to get a job there. The corrections officer said yes!! They had to be both tased and pepper sprayed to work there as part of their training. Not that I was interested, but that definitely took Corrections Officer off my list of potential future jobs!
I took my sub back to the inn and ate it at the common table while reading. I had talked with Lee earlier and would stay in the same room tonight that Gillian and I had been in, but tomorrow I would move to the bunkhouse out back to save money. It was only $25/night for a bunk and the bunkhouse room looked clean and nice. I knew I might be there for the rest of the week depending on how fast my heels heal. As I finished my dinner, who arrived at the inn but Slow Joe!  Joe was in the bunk below me at Johnny’s Nolichucky hostel and had been at the shelter at Cherry Gap with Starbucks and Pritch, and then disappeared. Apparently he got off the trail for a few days as his feet were hurting. He was now back. He ordered a sandwich from Pizza Plus and we chatted a bit at the table. We talked about gear and cold weather. He also said that he had attempted to summit Everest three times previously but had not yet, although he had climbed some other big peaks. I though that was crazy. I told him it sounded really dangerous from what I read in Krakauer’s “Into Thin Air.” He said it wasn’t and that Krakauer exaggerated and was full of it. Just when I was getting interested and was going to ask him to expand on that and explain, his wife called. Maybe I will get that story tomorrow or farther down the trail! 
I went upstairs to retire for the night and catch up on journaling. In other news, I exchanged texts with Bear Meat today and he and Clooney should be rolling into town Wednesday morning. If timing works out, I will grab breakfast with them. It will be awesome to see them again and hear about their adventures!
I’m grateful for this lovely inn to rest at and that I’m starting to be able to accept that I have to rest and to enjoy puttering about. 
Time for sleep as it is part of the healing process! Good night all, to all a good night!","Damascus, VA

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585659,"I woke up at 8 this morning. I feel like if I didn’t have a trail name already, maybe “The Local” or “Governor” would be appropriate. I’m a fixture in Damascus now.... I checked my heels. My right heel was looking a bit better. My left was still a bit raw and oozy. I showered and got my stuff ready to move to the bunkhouse. I had been staying in the private room Gillian and I had, but the bunkhouse is less than half the cost, so I’ll move there to save dough while I heal. It’s quite clean and rather small with 4 bunks and one private room sharing the space, so it will do just fine. I booked two more nights. Just looking at my heels, the earliest I can possibly get out of here without immediately messing them up again will be Thursday. I’ll have to play that by ear. If I have to stay longer I will - I’m in this for the long haul, contrary to my little April Fools joke the other day. The trail will provide, IF I listen...
After I got my stuff moved into the bunkhouse, I moseyed over to Mojo’s, my home away from home and oasis in the desert. I got a coffee, egg and cheese bagel, and a cinnamon roll. It was all delicious! I sat and read quietly for some time while nursing my coffee. I saw some hikers I recognized from the Smokies - Yezzelle and 3 other folks. I waived hello to Yezzelle and as I did I noticed something interesting. There was a hiker sitting at the breakfast bar, and he had a cat on a leash with him inside! What?! I had seen the guy earlier. He had matted dread locked hair that came down a little below his ears, and appeared to be coloring at the counter. I had noticed a small pink stuffed animal under his stool, but didn’t see the cat. Quite frankly I thought at the time that maybe he was just a little nuts and then didn’t think much more of it! Turns out the stuffed animal was the cat’s toy. I was very curious about this, but the guy seemed to be doing his own thing so I didn’t go over and ask. After a while I went up to get more food. I ordered a turkey Reuben and a coffee refill. I know...I can eat! I have definitely put a bit of weight back on in Damascus. Probably a good 3-4lbs. Not a bad thing at all!
I took a few stealthy pictures of the cat on the stool and sat back down. When I was ordering food one of the waitresses made a comment that insinuated that they did not want the cat inside. It seemed like he had just sort of set up shop in there without asking. Other people had dogs that they kept inside. I didn’t really care - it was none of my business and I was getting a real kick out of seeing this cat on the stool. I also noticed the guy’s pack in the corner. It was stashed neatly out of the way, but there was also clearly a sign on the door that said to leave packs outside. That could have been contributing to what seemed to be slight annoyance amongst the staff.
The cat seemed happy as a clam. As I ate my sandwich, I watched it jump down off the stool and play with its pink stuffed animal. It was hilarious and made me miss my cat. I saw that he had given it a cup of food or something under the stool. I guess I’m not the only hungry cat in town anymore! So many questions came to mind. How does he hike with it during the day - does it walk alongside or sit in his pack? Does it kill mice at shelters? Will it stay near camp or does he always have to keep it tethered? So many questions.... 
Around that time, I looked up from my book with blurry eyes and saw two girls waiving at me from near the counter. I squinted and realized it was Stumbles, Cheddar, and Fifty! Candyman was outside with his gear. I got up to chat with them and see how they had been making out. They arrived last night and it seemed they were going to head out today. I was envious! I wanted to head out too. I told them I had been here since Friday and their eyes bugged out, so I explained about my heels and that I hadn’t gone native and decided to run for office here. The last time I had seen them was back at Hogback Ridge Shelter. They stopped by and then headed in to their hostel. I asked Candyman how that had been and he remarked that it was really good. They told me that “the bubble” was right behind them - about 40 or so hikers - and asked if I was worried about that. My response was basically what can I do? I have to let my body heel. But yeah, I’m not crazy about the idea of a huge bubble enveloping me and following me up the trail. That said, at this point in the hike and after all of the weather we have been through, I don’t think the bubble can be all that huge. Also, bubbles tend to gather around shelters, and stealth camping is a great way to get a bit more peace and quiet. Still, my mind couldn’t help but invent crazy scenarios of marching bands tramping through the woods, of kids with stereos booming whatever today’s modern day frat boy version of Dave Matthews is, ukuleles strapped to their packs for later musical ensembles at the shelter. In my head, the bubble was bad. If what I described doesn’t sound bad to you, then just insert whatever might potentially compromise a peaceful woodland experience for you. Anyway, I snapped out of my ridiculous mental scenarios and let it go. I probably wouldn’t even notice a bubble. All I need to focus on right now is resting and getting my heels healed. That is all that matters. I felt at peace again, and fortunately I don’t think my mental panic showed on my face.    
I decided to head back to the inn, but before I did I ordered a piece of coconut cake to go for later, and recommended the cinnamon bun to Cheddar and Stumbles who were still inside. I hope they enjoyed it as much as I did! Slow Joe showed up as I was about to leave, but abandoned Mojo’s for Subway as a long line of people had formed. He said he had eaten at Mojo’s for breakfast at about 7:30. I made my exit and returned to the inn.
I read in the porch for a bit, enjoying some Yerba mate tea. The inn has a porch swing, so I sat in that and listened to the birds sing. After a while, I got the hankering for my piece of cake. I took my tea to a common area out back and joined a couple from St. Louis who was drinking beer out back. They had been section hiking but were wrapping up their trip. I ate my cake, drank my tea, and chatted with them for a spell. He was a deputy Sheriff named Cale, and she went by Pinky (apparently she had broken her pinky on a previous hike and also liked to wear a pink beanie. We talked about hiking, gear, the usual stuff, as well as St. Louis and its bike paths (apparently it had a good system of networked trails). It was a fun way to while away some afternoon time. The weather was nice out. After that I headed into the bunkhouse and met a section hiker named Piper. He and his uncle had just finished a hundred mile section of the trail and were crashing for the night. Overall it was a good day!
I was grateful for the lovely weather today and the time to relax, and it was good to putter around a bit and see other hikers from past days once again. I hope my heels will look and feel much better tomorrow. I hope they improved today! I know I am antsy and I recognize that. I have to trust that things will work at as and when they are supposed to. I appreciate all the comments and support on blisters! Hopefully I’ll be able to get moving out of Damascus in a few days and will have a bit more interesting content. Today seemed like a good time to talk a bit about camp life and chores, so here is a little write up I prepared in that topic.  
CAMP CHORES:
Some of you might wonder, what does he do when he gets to camp? He must be bored out of his mind. On the contrary, camp life keeps me very busy. When I’m hiking, I tend to get to camp near sunset, so there isn’t much time left to get chores done. When the sun goes down, things are harder to do with a headlamp, other people are trying to sleep (especially in the shelter), and it gets very cold (though we have had some warm days lately). Most people want to be done with chores and in their sleeping bags to get warm. Most thru hikers don’t have the energy or extra supplies to build a fire, though sometimes we do if we can find dry wood and it’s not too late, windy or cold to go through the effort of building a fire. It will be interesting to see if we build more fires as it gets a tad warmer, as contrary as that might seem. 
When I get to a shelter or campsite, I first figure out where I’m going to sleep. If in the shelter, then I need to claim my spot by laying down at least my sleeping pad. I would typically lay my pad down, inflate it, and then plop my sleeping bag on top. Then it is all about getting organized such that I’m not clanking around everyone in the shelter. There isn’t a lot of space in most shelters, so sometimes you have to sleep shoulder to shoulder like sardines. I would usually only sleep in a shelter if it is not crowded and I want the convenience of not pitching a tent (maybe I have gotten into camp around dusk), if I have to due to regulation (such as in the Smokies), or if I am expecting nasty weather and want to avoid tenting in it. Otherwise, I prefer sleeping in my tent.
If I’m pitching my tent, then that is the first thing I do. Once it is up, I set my sleeping pad and bag out inside the tent. If I’m wet, I get into dry clothes. If it’s cold, I either quickly change to my camp clothes or I immediately throw on a few layers while I get through my camp chores. This ensures that as my body cools down after hiking, I don’t get cold. I also like to go ahead and get my headlamp around my neck, just so I have it ready when I need it.
When my tent is set up or my pad and bag are in the shelter, I then like to go ahead and hang the rope for my food bag, assuming there aren’t bear cables or bear boxes for food.That is one activity I definitely don’t want to do in the dark, though I have in a few occasions. I like to get it hanging and prepped over a good branch and so that after dinner I can attach my food bag, hoist it up, and lock it in place quickly without a lot of effort. It’s just nice to have this set up and ready because once I eat I’m already thinking about getting in my sleeping bag! I hang my food bag  with a PCT hang (utilizes a carabiner and a a stick to keep the food bag suspended, rather than tying the rope off around another tree); however, I have learned to simply tie it off around another tree and avoid the PCT hang if the rope might be exposed to snow or freezing rain overnight. Those conditions make it very hard to dislodge a PCT hang, and therefore hard to get my food bag down.
Next is water. I like to fill my water bottles and get another liter in my CNOC gathering reservoir ready to go. That way I have water for cooking and cleaning and do not have to get more in the morning. If it might get below freezing overnight, I won’t keep extra water in my CNOC collection bag as I don’t want it to freeze and expand in the bag. Once I have that done, I make my dinner. I usually have a cup of tea while my meal is cooking. I have a video of my cook system on this site. When I’m done, I take all of my food, trash, and anything I’ve cooked with that may smell like food, place it in my food bag and hang that on the line that I have pre-hung over a branch, or in bear cables if they are available. I always do one last sweep of my pack for any snacks or wrappers, as well as my pants pockets. I tend to only store snacks in the same pocket of my bag, so I don’t forget and leave them in my bag. If mice smell them, they might chew through my tent to investigate, and that would not be good. I never eat dinner in my tent or the vestibule of my tent; I try to eat some distance away from my tent so that food smells, or any crumbs, won’t attract critters to where I am sleeping.
After that I brush my teeth and sanitize my hands. Then it’s usually getting dark or already dark, and I climb into my tent. I make sure my gear is as organized as possible, and then check my guidebook for mileage and to establish my goals for the next day. I look at water sources, mileage, shelter locations, etc. If I have a phone signal, I check weather using atweather.org. If the temperature will dip below freezing, I have to remember to put my water filter in my sleeping bag, and potentially my water bottles too (or dump them out and get water in the morning in the freezing cold.... I usually throw them in the bottom of my bag). When all that is done and settled, I usually journal and then go to sleep. Wash, rinse, repeat. I have reading material on my phone via my Kindle app, but I am usually too tired to read after journaling. Whether I can squeeze both in usually depends on how any miles I have hiked that day and what time I get into camp. Usually when I talk with other hikers it is at the shelters, when I see them on the trail, or while making or eating dinner. After that we all tend to go to our separate sleeping bags; we don’t really hang out and talk outside. This is mostly due to the cold weather. As it warns up I’m sure there will be lovely warm, or lightly cool, nights where I will stay out and up to chat with folks. There was one night back after passing NOC when it was about 28 degrees out, but some gentlemen had built a big fire so we all collected around that and talked for a bit, but I think I might have spent 15 minutes there before retreating to my sleeping bag.
In the mornings, I get up and break down camp and make breakfast. If my tent or footprint is wet, I usually stuff it in the mesh part of my pack, or even clip it across the back of my pack so it can dry as I hike. When I get to a sunny spot for lunch,  I try and completely dry stuff while I eat and look at a pretty view, so I will find a sunny spot to lay it all out. I don’t always eat a hot breakfast, but most days I at least have coffee even if I don’t eat hot oatmeal. Sometimes to save fuel and time I just pour a little water into my oatmeal packet and eat it cold - I don’t mind that at all. Once camp is broken down and I’m done with breakfast, it’s time for the day of hiking to start! I always do one last 360 degree sweep of camp to make sure I haven’t forgotten anything or left any bits of trash. 
Hopefully that gives you a good picture of how camp life usually plays out. I like to look at the stars, but it has been too cold most nights so far to stand outside at night for long. In the absence of light pollution in the mountains, the stars are incredibly bright and utterly breathtaking! I love when the owls hoot back and forth at night. Sometimes I camp by small creeks and listen to the flow of the water. I like that too but I always feel like it is going to make me pee myself at some point. I still love it though! I love company, but nothing beats waking up and having a campsite to myself in the morning. It is quiet and peaceful and I can listen to the small birds start about their daily calls and foraging.

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585782,"Steve-O was in the bunk above me last night and rose early. I stayed in bed until about 7:45 and then jumped in the shower and went into the main house to have tea. The plan was to meet up with Bear Meat and Clooney for breakfast. We had exchanged texts and they were going to be staying at Hikers Inn that night. I was excited about the reunion as it had been quite some time since I’d seen them.
Around 8:45 or so they came through the front door. They dropped their packs and after a bit of initial catch up chatting, we walked along the creeper trail over to Mojo’s for breakfast. There was a guy named Remmy from the bunkhouse, also from the Atlanta area, who joined us. We ate and enjoyed the luxury of Mojo’s and caught up on trail stories. The craziest story was of Clooney at Clingman’s Dome in the Smokies. She slipped on the ice and fell, but had her hands in the straps of her trekking poles so her arm kind of stayed stationary and she dislocated her shoulder.  She then proceeded to reset it back in its socket herself on the trail. Hardcore! She’s an ER nurse so I guess fortunately she knew how to do that, but that’s pretty amazing. True grit! That made me feel much better about my heel blisters!  
After breakfast I hung back at Mojo’s to chill out a bit and check up on a few things online. I ate a second cinnamon bun because, well, just because, and then headed back to the Inn. I also ran into Nomad at Mojo’s, who was heading out that day on the trail, and Rivers, who also was heading out. Seeing lots of familiar faces is kind of a fun byproduct of sitting around town for a few days.
When I got back to the Inn, Remmy had gifted us each a bag of Easter candy that his mom had sent. It was awesome! I ate the entire bag over the course of the afternoon. I went inside to have tea with the candy and who shows up at the door but Cole, now going by Captain Krispy! It was good to see him again. Everyone looks like they have lost weight, because we all have. I asked Cole about his trail name and it is a combination of his Krispy Kreme donut hat and his captain America attire, like his crocs. The name Captain Krispy cracks me up. 
I later went back to the bunkhouse to read, but that turned into an afternoon nap. I napped and read and even watched a little Netflix over the WiFi. I ordered pizza and garlic bread for dinner from Pizza Plus. Traveler showed up at the bunkhouse too, so I caught up with him a bit on how his hike had been. He pulled a quad muscle at one point. It seems like some kind of injury had befallen most people. 
I’m staying here tonight and plan to tomorrow as well. I may get out of here Friday but will wait and make that call then. My heels are healing, it is just taking a bit of time before they will be ready to be taped up and walked on. I may end up staying here the weekend. My main focus is just making sure I don’t leave before they are ready. I don’t want to put my hike at risk by leaving too soon. 
I was grateful to be able to accept and embrace my situation today and to just enjoy “being.” I was also grateful to reunite with good people again. I suspect breakfast tomorrow will be fun and full of more stories.
Time to rest!","Damascus, VA

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585835,"Yep. Still here. Remember that movie with Bill Murray called “Groundhog Day?” I’m really glad that in my version I’m not working! I’m officially a man of leisure in Damascus. I feel like a local now. I tell other hikers where things are, what times things open and close, what the best items on the menu at Mojo’s are. I tell stories about the local cat Smokey - how fat he is and how he eats the birds in Lee’s yard. I explain how laundry works at the inn and that there are scrubs to wear while said laundry is being done. I walk the Creeper trail to Mojo’s and waive hello to the cyclists. I know the lady who works at Subway and she asked how I was doing as I left Mojo’s today, where I am on a first name basis with the waitresses and it is only a matter of time before I start washing dishes. I know that the Broken Fiddle is the “party hostel” in town. I know that it is better to team up to order multiple pizzas from Pizza Plus or you end up spending a lot more with delivery. I can give you a long list of Mojo’s desserts and rank them in order of their relative awesomeness. I know what brands of shoes are sold at each of the outfitters and I know who has the best selection of mountain house meals. I also know that just down the street there is a modest property for sale that includes a small cabin for $200k, which seems expensive but it includes a lovely tract of land right off beaverdam creek. I know the various flavors of Epsom salts available at the Dollar General, and I know that ziplock bags are on aisle 6 at Food City.
Get. Me. Out!!!
In all honesty, while I am very antsy to get back on the trail, it’s been nice doing a lot of nothing. I’ve gained back some weight. I’ve been chatting a lot with other hikers, and I’ve caught up on some Netflix. Somehow the days still seem to pass relatively quickly. I needed the lesson in patience. I was groomed to be and required to be a 150mph multi-tasking machine during my career in the tech world. It really takes a lot to unwind and unpack all of that baggage. I feel like this situation with my heels has been inserted into my journey as an emergency measure to get me to slow down. It’s working. And the irony is, it plays on my pragmatism. It knows that I view this time as an investment towards accomplishing my hike. I invest the time and care, my heels get better, and I hike on. If I head out too early, my investment is wasted and I start back at square one. It knows I cannot ignore this practical reality. And so I hide my time and let my body heal.
My heels are healing. Every day they are a bit better. Right now it looks like I might be able to start hiking again on Saturday. I plan to evaluate tomorrow again of course. Brutal honesty and acceptance are the only things that will serve me well here. 
Last night when I went back to the bunkhouse Traveler was in the bunk above me. When I woke up, myself, Traveler, Captain Krispy, Bear Meat and Clooney all went to breakfast. It was Clooney’s birthday, so it was extra festive! Most of us got the huevos rancheros (those are the best!). I of course got two cinnamon buns. Fattening up in Damascus is easy!  We chatted a lot, then walked back to the bunkhouse. Traveler and I gabbed some more, and I talked more with the Captain as well. 
Lee, per her usual sweet self, agreed to give Bear Meat and Clooney a ride to Food City to resupply, and I decided to tag along to get some veggies to make a salad for lunch. I then found out that Lee drives a convertible. I had never ridden in a convertible before, so I got excited to ride with the top down. I felt like a king - like Vanilla Ice on the A1A, only back in the 90s before he was just flipping houses. The trip to food city was quick. I grabbed some candles to slip to Bear Meat for later so that maybe they could put one in a dessert for Clooney’s birthday at dinner. Hopefully that worked out.
When we got back I chatted with Traveler again and had some Yerba Mate tea. I made my salad and ate it - power greens, cherry tomatoes (yellow ones), Gorgonzola and ginger dressing (Makata).  Then I went and napped for a while. Apparently Captain Krispy did his whole resupply organization while I slept, including talking to himself, because he didn’t even see me under the pile of covers. I was oblivious to it all, sleeping soundly. I really like the midday siesta thing. I could get used to that!
Later, closer to 5, Traveler and I walked down to Mojos and got take out. I grabbed a West Coast Reuben and a piece of German chocolate pie. I ate it back at the house with some more salad while watching Netflix. I chatted with Gillian for a bit. She sent me an adorable picture of Lucy the cat standing on our coffee table trying to get Gillian to play with her ribbon, her favorite toy. I miss them both dearly, and that is harder when I’m not doing much other than resting up.  I decided to take a second shower because, well, why not?
Tomorrow will be another day. Bear Meat, Clooney, and the Captain will head out. I’m not sure about Traveler. New people will probably come into the bunk house. The bubble is looming behind me. It is what it is. I have to let that go and focus on healing and only leaning when I am in good shape to hike.
I’m grateful for the camaraderie today and for the sunny skies we had. It was fun to have Traveler and The Captain in the bunkhouse. I was grateful for the convertible experience (box checked!) and  for the ability to rest and nap comfortably and to start to be able to let go of some of my restlessness (albeit not all) and just be. Progress, not perfection! I’ll take it. I’m sure you are all getting a bit bored of the Damascus entries, but don’t worry - there will be plenty of interesting adventurous days to come!  Soon....","Damascus, VA

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585917,"It’s been a week. A week long lesson on easy does it. I woke up at about 8am. I stayed up until about 11:30 last night watching chapter one of Planet Earth II - the BBC series. Chapter one is on islands, and the sloth was featured in the episode. I couldn’t help but relate. I’d felt a little like a sloth this week. It’s been good though. I woke up relaxed and went to breakfast with Bear Meat, Clooney, Traveler, and Captain Krispy. Bear Meat and Clooney were hiking out right after breakfast, and The Captain was heading out not long after. Traveler was taking a zero. We had a great time at breakfast. I had the breakfast quesadilla and my usual two cinnamon buns, one delayed so as to make me feel a little less disgusting.
After breakfast I went back to the Inn to tape up my feet a bit and try walking in my shoes. I did so. My heels felt ok, with my left heel definitely a little further along than my right. What was odd though was that my right shoe felt too tight. I had spent forever in the shoe store earlier in the week trying them on and fussing about fit, how was it that it felt tight? I kept walking and hooked onto the Creeper trail to go back to the inn. When I got back, I sat on my bunk and messed with my shoes and socks. There was no doubt about it, the shoe was too tight. The only thing I could think of that might have happened was that my feet had continued to expand during the week. It wasn’t out of the question given I had them out of my shoes and in my crocs this week. While I no longer had my receipt or shoe box, I knew the guy at Sundogs, Brad, would remember me so I took the shoes back. He was incredibly nice and understanding and let me try a half size up - 10.5s. I tried those on. Hmmmmm...could it be that the right shoe was still too tight? It was crazy, but I decided to try the 11s too. My boots were a size 9 and normally in Altras I take about a half size up. Was it possible that my feet had grown an entire size and a half. Bingo! The 11s fit the best! I was astounded, and tried the 10.5s yet again, but I walked away with the 11s. I think I have seriously underestimated the abuse I’ve dished out to my feet! A friend of mine suggested that I change my trail name to “Clown Feet” via text (thanks Tony! ;-). He’s kind of right though - size 11 is a bit ridiculous for a guy who is 5’8”. I should measure them and see if they are as long as I am tall.
Anyway, I got that sorted and feel much better now. I ate a salad for a late lunch and felt good about that, until I found another bag of candy in the hiker box and destroyed it like a hungry cat will. I chatted with Paul at the inn and then ended up going to Mojo’s to have dinner. I ordered wings and a bagel and lox. As I ate the wings, a section hiker named Boots, also staying in the bunkhouse, showed up so I invited him to join me. He’s from Chattanooga, TN and hiking southbound from Grayson Highlands to Sam’s Gap. We had a good chat over dinner. As we ate, RTK and Scars showed up! I hadn’t seen them since the Smokies. We caught up a bit on that, and I asked Scars what the cause was of his kidney pain in the Smokies. Turned out it was related to dehydration and lack of food. After dinner Boots and I moseyed back to the Inn and it was time for me to settle down for the evening. My heels are about ready to be taped and for some slow going hiking. I would like to leave tomorrow, however, we have some wet weather rolling in - rain and snow. I’m going to wake up tomorrow, power myself up with some cinnamon buns, and make a call. If it is really wet, I’ll wait one more day, just so my heels don’t have the wet factor on day one, and head out Sunday. If it looks like it can stay dry for a few hours, I’ll probably walk about 5-6 miles and pitch my tent at a nearby campsite. Thank you all for the encouraging comments, tips, and for sticking with me through this!! I really appreciate it. Damascus is a cool little town. A lot of folks liked Hot Springs better, but no me. Damascus will always have a special place in my heart and stomach.
Someone asked me in the guest book if hiking the AT and meeting people on the trail has changed my outlook on life. I think it might be a bit early to answer that question, but I wanted to share a few thoughts I had on that. I think the answer is no. And yes. I don’t think it has changed my outlook on life. I think I did a lot of other work and had other experiences prior to the trail that helped me to see both the possibility of really thru hiking the trail, as well as the reality that I really needed to make some changes in my life, most notably how I was approaching my professional life. But the other side of that coin is that the trail has changed me just by re-affirming that I could do this - that I could break away from societal norms to have an adventure and be ok. I had the courage to let go, but the trail is giving me the experience of unfettered freedom. It is allowing me to see that, yes, in fact less is more, and I can do more with less. So in that sense it is impossible for it to not help in shaping a new outlook on life. It just isn’t some kind of white light experience.  The trail gives me opportunities to practice important things that I am historically quite bad at, such as patience, humility, acceptance of no-strings-attached kindness, asking for help, and following advice. In a more structured life I can often avoid or frame such things. On the trail they become important on a different level, both to my experience and my survival. The trail quickly puts my ability to be rigorously honest with myself to the test. Am I hiking too fast? Should I go farther today to avoid weather conditions on a ridge, or is the abuse to my body in pushing more miles calling for me to stop now? I have already demonstrated that a lack of rigorous honesty, a lack of acceptance, can quickly manifest as a problem or injury. And sometimes it is hard to know these things, just as sometimes I might have to spend some time thinking or meditating to be sure that I am being truthful with myself, particularly when it comes to my own limitations and my will and desire for things to go towards a certain plan that I have concocted in my head. The trail is a great place for me to experience the raw truth that the universe doesn’t care about my plans; the universe has its own order and I am a tiny, insignificant part of that.  Meeting others on the trail has certainly been fun. The trail tends to bring out the best in people, and most hikers are wonderful, trustworthy people. It’s a reminder of how “real” life can be, sometimes is, and often is not. Hikers have a strong sense of community, partly because we are united by a common activity. I believe this is particularly true for thru hikers, because we are united with a common purpose as well. When I crossed Newfound Gap in the Smokies and walked through the parking lot of rambling tourists who had pulled over to use the bathroom, stretch their legs and take a picture, I felt lost. Lost in a crowd. The sense of commonality, of camaraderie was not there. I received curious looks in the parking lot as I emptied my trash, repacked gear layers, and probably smelled like a garbage can myself. The trail gives me an opportunity to experience the gift that is being part of a strong community, as well as its fragile nature. I hesitate to label it ephemeral, for in the end it is created by people and erased by people, all through our actions and behaviors. It can be sustained as well as erased. The trail reminds me of the power of kindness and community, when so often our society feels so individually selfish, or goal seeking at the expense of or disregard for others. In life, too often there are heroes and villains, winners and losers, liberals and conservatives, my team or the other team - a ridiculous sampling of pointless polarity. On the trail, there are just hikers. Hikers help each other when something goes wrong. Hikers say hello and chat. Hikers yield the way. Hikers offer food. Hikers tolerate differences. Hikers are not violent, and have a healthy means for processing unhealthy thoughts. Of course it isn’t always this way. There are exceptions and the trail is not some grandly perfect utopia. But in general, the trail allows a microcosm for community and a kinder, gentler life, to bloom. As I refer to the trail, I want to be clear that I am not anthropomorphizing it. It is what it is. It is not kind, it can seem cruel and harsh at times, and it always demands respect. It is, simply, nature.
I’d like to think that hiking the trail will somehow help me to become a better person, to make the best choices I can make. If nothing else, I know it will help me with acceptance, and patience, and those kinds of things that I struggle with. Maybe other things will happen as a result. I try not to think too far ahead. I try to just live 24 hours at a time. Before I started this journey I promised myself I would practice being present on the trail - just being. I try not to think too far ahead. I don’t think about Katahdin. I don’t think about figuring out my life while hiking the trail, or figuring out what I will do for work after. I often think about food though! I also never really thought about whether the trail would change my life. I went into this purposely trying not to have any expectations, other than to be grateful and enjoy all of it, the wonderful and challenging moments. I’m sure you can tell that being in Damascus this long has been a challenge for me. But that is my perspective problem; that is my mind’s problem. It is NOT a real problem. And so I focus on being grateful for all of the awesome things about Damascus, because there are such things and it helps me to stay in a healthy state of mind. There is a reason I like to make a gratitude list every day, because it is easy for me to “forget” to be grateful, and I am happier when I am. Life is better when the cup is half full. Reminders never hurt me; in fact, they always help me. Even if the trail provides nothing else, it gives me the opportunity to practice living a more grateful life. Before the trail, when was the last time I truly appreciated clean clothes? Laundry was just a tiresome chore. Now it is a delight! 
I’m sure I will have more thoughts on this topic later on. Remember these are just my thoughts. This is a personal journal - a place for me to record my thoughts and experiences on this journey. I prefer to keep a journal rather than use social media for these things, lest people get confused and think that my thoughts and feelings are projected on them, representative of anyone other than myself, or a forum for debate. This is just me talking about me. I expect other hikers will have their own thoughts and different experiences with how the trail has or hasn’t changed them.
David Miller made some observations in his book “AWOL on the Appalachian Trail” that I really like. At one point he says “when the path is clear to pursue a fledgling goal, the path is also clear for deeper insight into your desires.” I stretch this a bit and think that I cleared a path to hike the AT by making some tough choices about my career and the way I was living that part of my life. I do believe that cleared a path for me to learn more about myself, to build even greater confidence in who I am by being a better person, by being true to myself.  Where that leads I have no idea, but I am excited to walk that path. I feel alive! Miller also said later, “Now I see an unexpected benefit of thru-hiking. It is an escape from me. It is a forced simplification of my life; being on the trail limits the opportunities for me to pull myself in multiple directions.” I can also relate to this. It’s an escape from me but it isn’t. I still have to work at patience and acceptance. I still have to practice gratitude, and some days to fake it until I make it. But I no longer have the clutter and chaos that I had when I was working. It’s like some kind of long, healthy retreat. I’ve heard it said that it takes at least 30 days to form a new habit. Most people take less than two weeks of vacation a year. Most “retreats” are a week or less. A thru hike is 5-6 months in average. That amount of time, in a focused environment, offers a true opportunity for real growth, whatever that may be and however it may come.
I never regret my decision. I’m always happy to be in the trail. I always miss my wife, family and friends, and that is hard. I always miss Lucy the Cat, because she’s the squishiest. But I know I am on a good path - I’m where I’m supposed to be right now, and that’s all that matters, whether that is Damascus or some other part of the trail. The truth is I have no future career goals, no magic formula, no thoughts on Katahdin, no answers in life. I have only one plan in my head, and that is to keep walking.","Damascus, VA

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586042,"I woke briefly very early in the morning when it was still dark and could see Traveler’s silhouette, headlamp on, packing up his things. I quickly fell back asleep and didn’t wake until about 8:15. Black Dog (the kid who came into the bunkhouse yesterday) was awake; Boots appeared to still be asleep. Travelers things were gone, minus an apple that he had either forgotten or left. I grabbed a shower and by the time I finished the audible rain had ceased. I went inside the house and saw Paul. He told me that the bunkhouse was already booked for the night, so my only option was to pay more than double for a room in the house, split one room that had twin beds with another hiker, or move to another hostel. I decided to go have breakfast and weigh my options, including just hiking out despite the oncoming inclement weather. After all, it is easier to think clearly with coffee and a cinnamon bun!
The waitress at Mojo’s greeted me on arrival: “Hi Kevin - you’re still here?” Yeah...... I ordered a bagel and egg sandwich, coffee and a cinnamon bun. After I polished that off I ordered my usual second bun. So good! I decided that I needed a sign. It was hard to say how ugly the weather would get. The rain was supposed to subside until 2pm, after which it was supposed to snow, and then get into the low to mid 20s overnight. My heels felt about as good as they would get. I could hike a shorter day and camp and wait out the storm, or just stay one more night in comfort and head out tomorrow. I would go back to the hostel and see if some plan for a room at the inn would materialize. Maybe Black Dog would want to share a room. On my way back, Smokey the cat cane running towards me, his porky belly shaking as he trotted along. He rubbed against my legs and then jumped up on my leg as if to ask me not to go. Was this my sign, or was Smokey just being a cat?
Back at the inn, Black Dog was nowhere to be found. Then, Paul told me that some hikers coming in had booked everything but the Airstream trailer out back. The decision was made for me, and that was all the sign I needed. I started to get my feet ready. I felt like it was hard to get back on the trail, mentally hard that is. When I take too long a break in towns I can psych myself out a little if weather conditions will be fierce. The Smokies and my two days off at Fontana were a good example of this. In the case of Damascus, I was also just really nervous about my heels. Had they healed enough? I thought so, but what if I was wrong? I would also be hiking with brand new shoes - what if they aggravated my feet? These are questions that plagued my mind at breakfast, and that is why o felt like i needed to turn the decision over to something bigger than me and just let things play out. 
I put three coats of new skin on both blister areas, followed by two layers of Leuko tape and then moleskin. I slipped on my injiji sock liners and then my darn tough socks. I got my pack ready to go. My enormous food bag was crowning out of the top opening of my pack. Lastly, I grabbed the apple that Traveler had left (thanks mate!) and headed out. 
I was actually leaving Damascus!! The trail follows Laurel Ave. past Mojo’s. I strongly considered grabbing some kind of cake to go, but I needed to focus. My game today was slow and steady. I did not want to hike fast or hurry, and. I still had time to make it 6 miles or so before the winter weather kicked in. There were going to be quite a few campsites on my route, so I figured I would just hike and check in at each one to see how my heels were doing. That’s exactly what I did. 
The trail was relatively easy and forgiving. My shoes felt good, my heels felt ok, and there was a light mist and dribble in the air, but no real rain. It was excellent hiking weather. The trail ran along beside the Virginia Creeper Trail in several places, most notably on one long stretch along a beautiful stream. I saw a guy fly fishing in the stream 350 yards below from my vantage point on the ridge. I finally got to a campsite about 6.5 miles out and assessed whether I wanted to stop. The shelter was only another 3 miles away. My heels and feet felt ok. The weather was still behaving and it was early in the afternoon. I decided to keep walking. The switchbacks were gentle and in about an hour I saw the sign for Saunders Shelter. I noticed that there was a trail in a quarter mile on the south side that then went another quarter mile on the north side before reconnecting to the AT. I didn’t want to miss the quarter mile stretch of the AT by only waking the side trail in and out of the shelter, and I didn’t fancy doubling back on the shelter trail tomorrow to get to the southernmost point where it sprouts off of the AT. I decided to walk north on the AT until I saw the northern end of the shelter trail and enter it there. That way I could just retrace my steps in the morning and not feel like I was going backwards South. I’m a white blazer, so missing that quarter mile section of the AT was not an option!!
When I got to the shelter it was full, pregnant with a Boy Scout troop from Kentucky. A few thru hikers that I recognized were tenting behind it. It was startling to sleet, so I hustled uphill a bit, found a decent tenting spot, and got set up. I went back down to the shelter picnic table to make dinner out of the snow. The Boy Scouts riddled me with questions about gear and mileage. It was fun and they were nice. They had a great fire going, despite the snow! I warmed my hands over it. I ate chicken teriyaki mountain house, courtesy of trail angels Maw and Paw Hungry Cat. It was quite good! After that I had some trail mix, and some freeze dried guacamole mix with chili cheese Fritos. It was a pretty amazing dinner and a good way to wean myself off of Mojo’s. Inside Out showed up at the shelter. I hadn’t seen her since Cherry Gap when she showed up without a tent at that shelter. She had her tent now, and it was a good thing because the shelter was full. I got a bit of water from a piped stream about 100 yards behind the shelter, and then went back to my tent to get warmer clothes on and hang my food bag. I shook and brushed some of the snow accumulation off my tent. It wasn’t supposed to snow that much tonight. I got inside my sleeping bag and took a look at my AT guide. I would likely do another 9 miles tomorrow and stop short of the ascent of Whitetop Mountain. The shelter at Whitetop was too far at 19 miles. The next shelter was too close. I would plan to camp in the 3500’ elevation range tomorrow, which would be warmer anyway than the 5000’+ of Whitetop Mountain. 
I’m so, so, so grateful that my heels were ok today and that I didn’t have any foot drama. I’m thankful that I was able to feel that pushing out of Damascus was the right move today, and it was an extra bonus that the sleet and snow held off until I got to camp. It was a great day - Hungry Cat is back in action!","Damascus, VA
",Saunders Shelter,"Apr 07, Sat",9.60
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586402,"Last night Inside Out tented close to me since the shelter was full. I think she has a tendency to talk to herself, as I heard her doing so when I was in my tent getting ready to go to sleep. I talk to myself out loud occasionally as well, but only when I’m alone. Anyway, I don’t know what was going on, but I woke up in the wee hours of the morning to her muttering, shining her headlamp around, and making lots of noise. It sounded like she was breaking down camp, but it felt like a crazy hour to do that - I think it was about 3am. I fell back asleep, and when I woke up later in the morning she was gone. Maybe I will pass her later on and get the story on what happened. Another camp mystery!
I slept in until about 8. I got up and grabbed my food bag down and scrambled back to bag. It was cold - around 23-25! It was no longer snowing, but the wind was gently nudging tiny flecks of snow off of the branches overhead. I had breakfast in bag: coffee, two packets of maple brown sugar oatmeal with honey (courtesy of some honey packets I pilfered from Mojo’s), and a few spoonfuls of Jif Maple peanut butter. Jif Maple is the ultimate peanut butter and I can barely contain myself when I eat it. I found it at Food City in Damascus. Imagine the best day you’ve ever had on earth, and the best feeling you’ve ever had (whether medicinally induced or otherwise), and the best view you’ve ever seen. Combine all of those with winning the lottery and multiply that by one billion. Then add infinity. Now you’re getting close to what Jif Maple peanut butter is like. I very much want to procure a snickers so I can try dipping that in Jif Maple, but I’m a little afraid my head will explode. I’m definitely going to try it though. As soon as possible. It keeps me awake thinking about it and it makes me want to giggle. 
After breakfast, I took my time getting my gear together. My tent, tarp, and footprint were icy, and my down bag had ice in it too from condensation, so I would need to find a sunny place for lunch so I could spread that gear out to dry. My hands were once again numb from cold - we can’t seem to get away from it. I set off hiking to get my blood pumping.
I meandered along at a conservative pace and passed by some campsites next to a stagnant pond. At around 11:45, I rounded a bend and who was coming southbound but a guy named Zane. I had met Zane back in Georgia just north of Springer Mountain. I think I mentioned him in an early journal. Turns out he’s still chugging along. He was waiting on a package to arrive in Damascus, but as it was Sunday, he had someone shuttle him out of town and he was hiking back in. Then tomorrow morning he’ll get his package and get shuttled back to where he started today. I’ll probably see him again then! After we chatted, I came upon a nice sunny spot by a small creek. Looked good! I spread out my tenting gear and sleeping bag in the sun and sat by the creek on my butt pad to eat lunch. I had some tuna, nuts, and snack mix, and another couple of spoonfuls of Jif Maple. As my tongue pressed the Jif into the roof of my mouth, the sounds of the creek grew more vivid, more sharp. It was like I could hear each molecule of water making its own way downstream. Time slowed down. My eyes rolled backwards into a happy place in the back of my skull. The wind rustled ever so lightly, and I felt a tingling chill. Jif Maple. 
I stayed in that spot for about 40 minutes to let things dry. I filtered water and then sat down and played Pooh sticks. Just as in the Winnie the Pooh books, Pooh sticks is where you throw little sticks in the water and then watch their progression through the small shoals and tiny rapids. I pretended my sticks were kayakers, braving the rapids of the Stikine, or maybe the deadly Nile. I watched as one got trapped in a small recirculating hydraulic, disappeared and then reappeared 6 inches downstream (it was a small creek). It reminded me of books I liked as a kid, and still do like, such as The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer, and Paddle to the Sea. 
When things were mostly dry I headed on again. The trail dropped down and joined the Virginia Creeper trail for a bit. This section of trail was gorgeous as it followed  the banks of a lively, clear trout stream. I definitely want to go back to Damascus to ride the Creeper trail with Gillian - it has such amazing scenery and it’s all downhill! I turned off the Creeper Trail, weaving through the woods as droplets of melting snow released the rhododendron from the burden of their weight. I passed Lost Mountain Shelter and signed the log book. I saw Bear Meat and Clooney and Weeble and False Alarm had signed it too, albeit two days ago. I continued on and climbed up in elevation, crossing a cow pasture and road. My intended campsite was just ahead. There was only one level site and it was right off the trail behind a huge boulder. It looked pretty cool, so I took it! I had the place to myself. Black Dog passed by. He had left Damascus today. After he met me at the bunkhouse he had also gone to get a new pair of shoes. 
I did my normal camp chores and ate and retired early. I wanted to get up earlier so I could increase my miles a bit tomorrow while still keeping an easy pace. Tomorrow I plan to hike to Wise Shelter in the Grayson Highlands, as long as my heels feel ok. That will put me past the 500 mile mark! My total mileage in my journal has not been correct. Originally I included the Approach Trail miles - I deleted those because I decided I wanted the numbers to only reflect AT miles. I had a duplicate entry in the Smokies and I had to delete that. Now it is all correct!
I’m grateful that the snow wasn’t too bad and that the day was beautiful and my heels and feet felt good. I am happy that I was able to go easy today and ignore my ego, who wanted to walk “just a little bit more.” I’m grateful for Jif Maple and all of its bliss. Overnight it is supposed to rain/snow, and then do more of that tomorrow off and on. I’m hoping for some visibility once I get up to Buzzard Rock and the highlands. We shall see....","Saunders Shelter 
",Campsite at mile 488.7,"Apr 08, Sun",9.10
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586405,"I woke up to the sound of rain at 3am. That then made me need to pee, so I ran outside and it looked like there were some tiny, misty snowflakes mixed in with the rain. I went back to sleep and woke again at 5 to the sound of pelting ice on the tent fly. Some days it feels like the snow will follow us all the way to Katahdin. I slept another 30 minutes and then retrieved my food bag. I had cold breakfast in bag. I wanted to conserve a little fuel. Basically, that just means I skip my morning coffee and pour a little cold water into my oatmeal packets. I had a few spoonfuls of Jif Maple and wished I could envelope my whole body in it and then eat my way out. I packed up my wet tent and started hiking. 
I had a big climb to start the day. First I climbed up Beech Mountain. It was steep and I felt tired, but I felt ok and pressed on. I felt hungry a lot today, perhaps because Damascus spoiled me. After the initial climb things evened out a bit and then I started upward again to Buzzard Rock. Buzzard Rock is a lookout point and is supposed to have some of the best views in Virginia. Unfortunately, my view and everyone else’s today was that of snowy, blustery grey mist. Oh well.... I hiked on not seeing a soul and climbed up and around Whitetop Mountain. One of the earlier highlights of the morning was the road crossing at Beech Mountain Road. They had a toilet AND a trash can! Oh day of days! I promptly made deposits in both. 
The rest of the day was largely muddy, snowy, slushy, grey and cold. I took a 0.5 mile side trail up to the summit of Mt. Rogers. My guide basically made it out to be anticlimactic, but it’s the highest peak in Virginia and I figured if not now, when? The summit is oddly not a bald; rather it is a dense forest with some large boulders. There aren’t any real views from the summit. There is a geological marker on one of the rocks, but they were all covered with snow so I couldn’t find it. Womp! I decided to make my own summit triumph sign in the snow and I took a picture of it. Fortunately it wasn’t a long trail, and now I can say that I’ve been on the highest peak in Virginia. On the way down I ran into another thru hiker, GerMan. He’s German, from Cologne. After getting my trip report, he promptly skipped the Mt. Rogers trip. 
It was a little after midday and I was planning on hiking to the one shelter in Grayson Highlands, Wise Shelter. The afternoon hiking was good and got really technical as I entered Grayson Highlands Park. The park is not long like the Smokies; I’ll be out of it tomorrow morning. It’s known for its feral ponies though, and that was something I was excited about. The bad weather had me worried though - do ponies enjoy snow? Probably not.... I think snow makes them run off to the my little pony pretty pony castle. Anyway, I kept my eyes peeled through the grey mist as I climbed over huge boulders and through lots of technical rock jumbles. I finally reached the 500 mile marker on the trail! Well, there wasn’t a marker, so I made my own out of rocks and took a picture. Apparently I was really into self commemoration today. I scrambled over a bunch more rocks and waded through a ton more mud. As I lumbered down a rocky slope a shape caught my eye to the west. A pony!! It was eating grass about 20 feet off the trail. It was brown with a funny L-shaped white stripe. I took a few photos of it and then went on my merry way, gleeful at having seen a wild pony. I was also glad it didn’t try to come over and bite me with its crazy horse teeth. Ever get a good close look at horse teeth? Yeah - those babies will grind some Hungry Cat meat up! And they chew sidewise to inflict more pain. I actually secretly believe horses are evil. That’s another story, and I do still enjoy seeing them (from afar)!
I slogged through more mud and rock and was within a mile or so of the shelter when, yet again, movement to the west caught my eye. It was a bunny! It froze in place and I managed to get a picture. I want to see what kind of rabbit or hare it is when I have internet again. I like bunnies. Their teeth aren’t frightening. 
I got to the shelter and was the first person there! Sweet! It was full of trash and a set of flip flops - the classy Red Stripe Rasta ones with a built in bottle opener on the foot strap. There is road access for Day hikers only a few miles away, so not surprising. As I set up camp GerMan rolled in. Later on Sauerkraut showed up, as did a girl named Dimples from VA Beach. We talked about food and resupply, and then it was time to hit the hay. 
While the weather wasn’t ideal today, I was super grateful for the wildlife sightings. I’m glad I climbed Mt. Rogers and I was grateful that my feet and heels held out fine. I was also thankful the shelter wasn’t crowded and I had a space!  Hopefully the weather tomorrow will allow for more views.","Campsite at mile 488.7
",Wise Shelter,"Apr 09, Mon",14.90
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586467,"It was chilly when I woke up, but I could see from the light coming into the shelter that it was going to be a relatively clear day. Last night it was just me, GerMan, and Dimples in the shelter, and then Sauerkraut nearby in his hammock. I tried some new earplugs last night and they were amazing - so much better than my old pair. In the morning we all made breakfast. I decided to have ramen with TVP in addition to my two oatmeal packets. I may have snuck in a few sporkfulls of Jif Maple as well. Remember that one time back in high school when you had that one really awesome idea and you felt like you were on top of the world, indestructible, and could do anything you wanted with one hand tied behind your back, influencing the fate of mankind forever? Jif Maple. 
We discussed resupply plans. Originally I was going to resupply in Atkins, but there is a shuttle that runs from the Mt. Rogers Visitor Center just off the trail at Partnership Shelter, which is a day before the trail runs near Atkins, that can take us into Marion. Marion is bigger than Atkins and has a lot more store choices. I will need fuel, and I think Walmart in Marion will have that - I doubt Dollar General in Atkins  will. Also, apparently you can have pizza delivered to the visitor center! This all sounded like a better and more fun plan than Atkins. It also meant I could eat a bit more food now - extra bonus. I do really notice a difference when I eat more in terms of feeling strong when I’m hiking, and even enjoying it more. 
After breakfast, Sauerkraut and I talked about how trashed the shelter was. There were all kinds of wrappers in the fire pit - it was really a shame. Sauerkraut said he was going to pack it out, so guess what? I finally was able to bequeath the Trail Karma necklace that Chloe the Ridge Runner had bestowed upon me in the Smokies. Awesome, and I think Sauerkraut really appreciated the spirit behind it. Now the challenge lies with him to find the next recipient! We all trickled out of the shelter and headed off. The plan was to either camp just before Trimpi Shelter, if not make it to the shelter. Sauerkraut and I would camp at the same spot. He had misplaced his food bag hanging line and wouldn’t be able to get another until Marion, so he was hanging his bag on my line. Dimples had a bear canister, so it made sense that Sauerkraut and I camp together before Marion. 
I stopped to filter water just past the shelter, and then trekked on. It was a gorgeous day walking through the rest of Grayson Highlands Park. I was really glad I didn’t blow through it all yesterday in the crummy weather. I kept looking for more ponies, but didn’t see any. The Highlands landscape was gorgeous though. At times when the wind would die down there was kind of a stark, lonely sadness to it. I kept wondering if places like the Scottish Highlands ever felt like that. After a while I descended to a spot called The Scales. This is basically a large pasture in the highlands. It has an informational board in the middle of the pasture. The highlights are that farmers used to raise cattle and graze them in the highlands. They would sell them based on weight. They figured out that when they herded them all the way down out of the highlands into the valley to sell, the cows lost a lot of weight and so their return was smaller. They built the scales pasture so they could weigh the cattle in the highlands. Pretty smart! Also, later they introduced ponies to help keep some of the grasses down year round. The ponies live wild, but every year they are counted and, as the herd grows, they cull a few and relocate them. Interesting stuff.
Right before I hit The Scales, I ran into an interesting thru hiker named Gnome. He basically looked like the Travelocity roaming gnome, with a big pointy white beard and dark glasses. He was a lively guy and told me that he’d been getting turned around. It’s definitely true that the trail is hard to follow in the Grayson Highlands as there are a LOT of side and cross trails. There are also a lot of white blazes painted on the rocks, which can be challenging when the rocks have snow on them. Gnome said he slept at the same shelter two nights in a row because he basically walked in a huge circle one day! Hilarious, but also a little terrifying as I can totally see myself doing that (reasons I got Guthook). He said he was hungry and low on food, so I offered him some snacks. He declined and said he had been foraging, and so we had a whole conversation (3 minutes) about foraging. I told him I am basically a three trick pony when it comes to foraging, and he started telling me about all the things he was eating. He mentioned that he had been finding ramps, and he also was eating mushrooms. He told me about a mushroom called turkey tail that looks like a turkey tail growing out of a tree. He said that it has a compound in it called PSK (poly something or other) that has, in several cases, proven useful in fighting cancer. He told me that in some cases it had reversed stage 4 cancers. Now, seeing as I knew Gnome for all of 3 minutes and he was lost in the woods, I figured I would probably look this stuff up later. Whether it is all true I do not know, nor do o know the details of the studies he mentioned. I like the idea of a cure all mushroom though! Gnome’s stories went on. He said that he had bought a boat in Rochester, NY for $50. I asked him why it was so cheap and he then said that the hull needed refinishing and it needed a lot of work, and also that he had traded his car for it. As part of the deal, the guy that sold him the boat let him stay there and use his tools to fix it. Gnome fixed the boat and then sailed it down the intracoastal to the Florida Keys where he lives. Hurricane Irma later destroyed her.... Gnome is originally from Franklin, NC. Interesting guy.... I also found out later in the day that Gnome told Sauerkraut that he had seen about 25 ponies. He had gotten lost on one of the horse trails! 
After The Scales, the trail once again ascended and woven through the highlands until coming to a fence and a cattle gate. There were some large flat boulders around, so I decided to dry out my tent from two nights ago. I never had a chance to dry it out yesterday as it was too wet and overcast. I spread my tent, footprint, and tarp out and placed rocks on them. I hung the tarp over a short wood section of the fence (the rest was barbed wire). It was a good place to eat lunch. I had some tuna and crackers and trail mix. Dimples passed by, and then Sauerkraut stopped by as I was getting everything packed up. I had kind of envisioned a horde of ponies sidling up to me while I ate lunch, curious to seen Hungry Cat trail life, but alas, no ponies visited. I headed out with Sauerkraut behind me. We crossed paths with a friendly day hiker, and then the trail became rocky and more technical. As I walked I planted my left trekking pole and it just folded in the middle. Yikes! The poles I have a quite good - Black Diamond - but, in fairness, they are break-down poles for traveling and not really meant for the abuse of a thru hike. I fully expected they would give out at some point. I decided to use my gorilla tape to try and tape the pole at the broken link. This worked ok until I slipped and had to put my weight onto the left pole to keep from falling. The good news was it sufficed to stop a fall. The bad news was it snapped and cut right through the gorilla tape. Sauerkraut and I stopped at the next shelter for a break and to sign the log, and I doubled down on the gorilla tape. I figured it would be good for one more solid brace. I hiked along awkwardly until the terrain got smoother, and then it was easier to work with one pole. I came upon a cool bridge crossing and saw Dimples there. Sauerkraut rolled up, and then I headed out, only to shortly run into a guy named Odie heading southbound. Dimples passed me as I chatted with him. He said he had previously thru hiked and he asked if I had seen the hiker yearbook. I had seen this at Mountain Harbour Inn. It’s basically a yearbook of thru hikers. He said we could be in it if we just sent him a picture with our trail names. Apparently Odie created the hiker yearbook. That sounds kind of neat, so it is on my list of things to do later. We have a lot of time to send him photos. I finished the climb and finally got to a ridge, or more precisely a small knob, and decided to drink some water and rest for a minute. I checked my phone and finally had a signal, so I texted Gillian and googled the number for Black Diamond customer service. They were great and even though my poles were well out of warranty and not designed for thru hiking, they gave me 40% off a new, more suitable pair. It worked out great and they shipped them to Pearisburg, where I already have a box to pick up. That was also the last phone signal I would have all day! I decided to keep using the gimpy pole as I figured it had one last good brace in it, but I decided to try and find a stick I could use as a substitute for a week until I got to Pearisburg. No luck finding one yet!
Sauerkraut caught up at the top of the ridge while I was making the order, and we walked together the rest of the day to the campsite just a few miles before Trimpi Shelter. There was no real reason to push more miles and we both were keen to set up camp and relax a bit. Dimples was pushing to Trimpi, so we figured we would just get an early start to catch up with her tomorrow so we could all go to Marion together. Sauerkraut is hammocking, so I checked out his setup at camp. There is a lot to dial in with hammocks, but I do think there are a lot of advantages over tents. Two guys named Wallace and Hot Tang showed up at the campsite. It was a long day and I needed sleep, but I ate two dinners - a rice side and a mountain house - before going to bed. After all, I was going to resupply tomorrow or the next day anyway!
I was happy to have good camaraderie on the trail today and very grateful for such awesome weather. It was nice not to see snow and just a solid day of good hiking with no foot issues. Tomorrow is supposed to be even warmer!
Postscripts:
#1 - thank you David for the kind offer! I didn’t even know where Waynesboro was, so I looked ahead in my guide. Apparently it has the reputation as being one of the friendliest towns along the trail! I guess good folks like yourself give it that reputation! Thank you!

",Campsite at mile 521.2,"Apr 10, Tue",17.60
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586468,"I woke up right at six and tried to motivate myself to get moving. It was cold, probably just above freezing. Sauerkraut and I both wanted to get an early start so that we could catch up with Dimples. We were really hoping to figure out a way into and out of Marion that afternoon. Dimples had gotten an offer from a trail angel she had met yesterday afternoon at a shelter, and so the plan was to give that person a call. There is a shuttle you can take, but you have to call to book it in advance and we wouldn’t be able to make that schedule work until tomorrow. Ideally we could knock out resupply today. 
I had oatmeal for breakfast and the last of the Jif Maple. Remember all those times that Michael Myers kept coming back from the dead in the Halloween movies? You thought he was gone but then he came back to haunt your dreams! Now imagine that but in a good way. Jif Maple.
I had some coffee and finished breaking down camp. Wallace and Hot Tang were stirring. Sauerkraut headed out while I put the finishing touches on my camp tidying and bag readying, namely taking my dirty wet tarp and affixing it to the back of my bag so it could at least dry a little while I walked.
The morning was beautiful! I warmed up quickly walking once the sun was up and out. I hiked alone for a good while. I passed through a beautiful, long meadow, and saw a random lone Daffodil, defending the Alamo amidst a sea of green grasses. I climbed over a cattle gate  bridge, and then up to a road crossing. I was about 2.5 to 3 miles in and had already passed the side trail to Trimpi Shelter. I stopped to take my outer layers off and to have a snack. Dimples passed me. She said she was the last out of the shelter and everyone else had left before she was awake. Apparently GerMan had spent the night there and taken off super early. He probably wanted to get into town early on a shuttle and back the same day. He told me he was trying to stay on the trail so that he could finish and still have time to do more sightseeing in the US before his visa expired. 
I started the long climb up the hill. It wasn’t so bad. I kept going as the terrain flattened out into what looked like the remains of an old forest road. Up ahead I saw Sauerkraut, my first sighting since leaving camp. As I walked up it was clear he had spotted something, so I moved slowly and deliberately forward. Sure enough, there were two deer in the woods just up the hill. It appeared to be a doe and her young fawn. Looking closer, there was a wound on the back of the mama deer’s leg, and what looked like battle scars on her side. It made us wonder if maybe a coyote had tried to ambush her, or if maybe she got hung up badly in barbed wire somewhere. 
We pushed on and Sauerkraut pulled ahead. I got mobile signal again finally so stopped a few times to text Gillian and a few others, as well as upload some photos to my journal. It really was a glorious day. I say an interesting piece of trail art hanging from a tree. It was barbed wire in the shape of the AT symbol with a green shotgun shell at the bottom. I took a picture. The trail was much less technical and really quite easy going at this juncture, so I trekked on.
After a bit, I came upon Sauerkraut airing out his hammock gear in the sun. I kept going as the shelter was only a few miles away. I was hoping to dry my gear out there and rest a spell. When I got to the shelter. It was reminiscent of the Fontana Hilton. It was large with two levels. It had an adjacent shower and a sink out back, but they weren’t working yet as they don’t turn the water on until the risk of pipes freezing is gone. There was a privy, fire pit, and clothesline. We could see the visitor center for Mt. Rogers from the shelter. This was pretty awesome! I laid out my tent gear and got my food back out to have some tuna for lunch. There was a clothesline at the shelter and I tried to use that for my tarp, but there were a bunch of briars behind the line. The wind immediately blew my tarp into the briars and their little fangs sunk into my tarp, making small piercings in a few places. Yikes! I quickly, but carefully, pulled it off the briars and the line.
Dimples and then Sauerkraut rolled in. They went to check out the visitor center, and I did the same once I got my tuna down the hatch. On the way I dumped my trash in the dumpster, including my poor left trekking pole. You will be missed! There were a ton of pizza boxes in the dumpster. It is possible to have pizza delivered from town to the visitor center! The visitor center was quite nice. There were lots of displays, including an animal scat ID chart, and a hellbender. Hellbenders are fairly large and can only exist in unpolluted, pristine waters. They had vending machines at the center. I purchased a Dr. Pepper and a snickers. 
I went back to the shelter to gather my things. We decided to take our packs to town given the proximity of the road and parking lot, versus leaving them unattended in the shelter. I got my stuff, headed back, and the others had called our ride, Jim Sparks. Another gentleman showed up just as Jim pulled in and offered a ride. We thanked him and told him our ride had arrived. He was wearing and Outer Banks hat. I complimented him on it - I love OBX! 
Turns out Jim Sparks is retired and his some hiked the trail years ago. He regularly gives hikers rides. He was super, super nice and spun Dimples over to a local motel to pick up a mail drop before dropping us all off at Walmart in Marion. There was an Ingles right next to Walmart, so we had what we needed. He told us to call him when we needed to get back to the shelter. The three of us made a plan to rendezvous at a pizza place about a half mile away at 5, and then went about our separate errands. I found almost all I needed, including canister fuel, at Walmart. It was pretty cheap too! I squatted in the shopping cart return area. There was an empty wall socket where they charge the sit-in carts, so I moved my stuff over there and plugged in my battery bank to charge it while I broke down my purchases. I took everything out of its boxes and poured it into my food bag. Not everything fit so I kept some items in a plastic bag. I picked up a few more things at Ingles, as well as I coconut water and an orange juice. I also saw a pimiento cheese sandwich at the deli and purchased that, promptly scarfing it down outside. I drank my coconut water while I marched the half mile towards the pizza place, Pizza Perfect. Next to Pizza Perfect was a Taco Bell. I had planned to eat a few tacos. I gave my parents a ring along the way to see how things were going and let them know I was alive. Inside I ordered three soft tacos and a root beer. I stashed away some hot sauce to use to flavor my rice sides. I then found the only seat with an outlet and continued charging my electronics while I ate. It was about four o’clock. I called Gillian to catch up as Sauerkraut waltzed in. It was good catching up with Gillian. We tried to FaceTime, but the free WiFi at The Bell isn’t the best, so I think I saw more of her than she did of me! I also got to see Lucy the Cat, who now adores Gillian and doesn’t remember her daddy at all. While we were talking a lady ran up to me inside Taco Bell and asked if we needed a shuttle and handed me a card. It was Jim Sparks’ card! It was Jim Sparks’ wife! She said she saw us sitting there with our packs and wanted to make sure we had a ride. I told her Jim was already on it - amazing!
When Gillian and I were done chatting, I quickly back posted a few journal entries. Dimples came in and chatted with Sauerkraut while I cleaned up in the bathroom a bit and got change to give Jim Sparks some gas money. We asked if he would accept it and he said he would, so we all agree to pitch in. It was the least we could do.  We were in excellent spirits as we headed out to Pizza Perfect next door. We plugged in again there and then ordered food. I ordered a small stromboli, a small Greek pizza, and a side salad. It was a crazy amount of food.... We got the food to go. Funny enough, one of the girls working there mentioned that she hadhiked the Great Walk in Beijing when she taught in China for a summer and loved it and wanted to go back with her husband. I told her that I had lived in Beijing for a good handful of years. I never would have thought that interesting connection would surface in the little town of Marion! Also, today I learned that, while from Virginia Beach, Dimples is starting school at Georgia Tech in Atlanta in the fall. Small world!
We called Jim and he appeared in mere minutes, like Batman. He gave us a lift back and we thanked him profusely and gave him the gas money. He had a hiker logbook that we all signed. We saw a few other hikers who I did not know in the visitor center parking lot. One guy goes by the name MacGyver. There was a couple from Brooklyn. The girl’s name was Roomy. I can’t remember the guy’s name. We ate our food and I polished off all of mine, miraculously. I organized my resupply and could barely hang my food bag it was so heavy. It was sooooooo heavy!! I think I went overboard. I got Jif Maple and Jif Cinnamon to try. We had a fire at night, which was nice because it was warm enough to stay outside and enjoy it. There is a section hiker staying at the shelter. I didn’t catch his name, but he was pretty interesting. He’s a herpetologist, so he knows a lot about reptiles and amphibians.
We sat out later than usual (until a bit after 9!) and turned in, utterly stuffed! I was basically grateful for everything today - getting signal and being able to talk with Gillian and my family, the weather, the good company, Jim and trail angels, the nice shelter, getting food, finding canister fuel other than the huge Coleman canisters at Walmart, and for a fire to end the night. Tomorrow the weather is supposed to be nice! Hungry Cat out!","Campsite at mile 521.2
",Partnership Shelter,"Apr 11, Wed",12.30
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586832,"I stirred in my bag just before sunrise. I was about 60% awake. I turned over onto my left side. I am a side sleeper, and for much of the trip I have had to turn from my left to my right back to my left (and so on) because my hips start to ache when I am on one side too long. I think this is because my sleeping pad, while I love how easy it is to inflate, is rather thin and firm once inflated. I decided I would go back to a thicker, inflatable pad. I have an insulated winter one at home, so I decided to order a lighter weight summer one and have it shipped to Pearisburg. I need to pick up my new trekking poles there anyway, so that will work out well. I can’t wait to try it! I’m pretty sure that will fix the hip issue. I pulled my ear plugs out and could suddenly hear the early morning in full effect. A very loud bird was right outside the shelter singing “ pew pew PEW PEW PEW,” as if it was mimicking the sound of some old fashioned sci-fi ray gun. This bird was clearly really into this song and just kept at it. It must have been sitting in the outer eaves of the shelter, but it felt like it was sitting right on my head like Woody Woodpecker, shouting into my ear. I wish I knew what kind of bird it was. It motivated me to get going, so I got up and grabbed my food bag down out of the tree. It was sooooo heavy! Just trying to slowly work it down cut off the circulation to my hands. I went back to the front of the shelter where I had set my pack and sat on the steps to make breakfast. The sunrise was beautiful, and I enjoyed watching it as I set water to boil. A Robin hopped around camp, puffing his chest out like he was the mayor of Partnership Shelter. It was kind of hilarious. They should rename it Crazy Bird Shelter. I also spotted a Towhee - another bird and the first one I’ve seen on this trip. With the warm weather and lower elevations, the avian wildlife is looking a bit more diverse and familiar, though I’m hoping to see birds that I have not seen before. 
Others started to wake - Rumi (correct spelling, not “Roomy” as I typed before) and Eddie Steady, Dimples, the Herpetologist. As the rest of the shelter came to life, we enjoyed some funny conversation and had a pretty lazy morning. I had a big breakfast of two oatmeal packets, brown sugar cinnamon pop tarts with Jif Cinnamon spooned on top (not as good as Jif Maple!), and a honeybun. Eddie Steady and Rumi live in Brooklyn. Eddie actually used to play saxophone in Stephen Colbert’s Late Show band - fun fact! There are so many really interesting people out here on the trail. 
After breakfast, Dimples and MacGyver headed out and the rest of us went up to the visitor center. I wanted to have one last look at the exhibits, charge my phone while doing so, and watch a short video they had on Hellbenders. We went over, dropping remaining trash in the dumpster along the way - a real luxury!! It was bittersweet for me because every time I opened the dumpster, I saw my poor left trekking pole inside, crumpled and sad. Ironic fact - breakdown trekking poles experience the opposite of rigor mortis when they die! What was once straight and strong can suddenly flex...to its doom.  The visitor center had a live hellbender in an aquarium there. It was cool to see it, but the aquarium was way too small. Hellbenders look like large salamanders with flattish heads and they have gills along the sides of their bodies. They eat things like crayfish and small minnows. They can only survive in pristine waters, such as mountain streams in forests that aren’t polluted by farm runoff, proximity of cities, or industry. They live under rocks, so even something as simple as moving rocks in mountain streams can impact their habitats. The visitor center also had scat and footprint ID exhibits. Eddie pulled up a picture of a bear footprint they saw in the snow back on hogback ridge, just 26 miles before Erwin. It looked just like the exhibit! I still have not seen a bear, but I really hope to.
When we got to the visitor center, Sauerkraut couldn’t find his electronics charger plug. He looked and looked and we checked the grass and road where we came back in from town last night, but it was gone. Finally he gave up and used mine to get a little more charge before we left. He had phoned Jim Sparks to see if he left it in his car. He had not, but Jim was awesome and said he would bring him one that he had in his drawer. JIm is pretty awesome!
We watched the video on hellbenders and then Eddie and Rumi headed out. I followed a bit after, and Sauerkraut hung back to meet Jim. Climbing out of the visitor center was lovely. It was a beautiful day and was good to be in shorts and a t-shirt, but still have a little crispness to the air. As I climbed up the ridge I got to a point where I had views on both sides. It was beautiful! I stopped to see if I might have a signal again, and I did. Virginia has been tough because AT&T signals are rare, and when I do get them they are usually when I’m hiking and trying to be in the moment. I hadn’t had a signal for a while and I wanted to do a few things, so I took off my pack and sat down. First, I texted my wife and a few folks. Then, I ordered a new sleeping pad and had it shipped to Pearisburg. I am hoping this one will be more comfortable on my hips. While I was doing these things, Sauerkraut rolled up and had to take care of a gear warranty issue of his own. It was weird to do online shopping from the trail, but hey - I had a rare signal and now I’ll have a new pad in Pearisburg.
Sauerkraut left the ecommerce trail way station before me, so when I was ready I hiked on alone. It was such a lovely day and I sang lots of songs. Eventually I arrived at Chatfield Shelter and saw Zane sitting there taking a break. I signed the register and we chatted for a few minutes, and then I hiked on. I ducked through rhododendron and then through some pine and eventually saw a house and a field on a trail to the right. I followed it as this was the site of an old 1890s farmhouse. They had the various structures labeled as to what their purpose had been, as well as some old machinery. I had thought that the settlers museum was at the same location, but after some confusion I realized it was just a little ways down the trail. I got back on the trail and continued on under some power lines that were buzzing intensely. It was kind of crazy, like they were radiating my entire body as I passed under them. I looked to the right where the power lines continued up the hill and saw a house under another huge transformer. It can’t be good to live under that!
Around the corner was the Lindamood schoolhouse. It was built in 1894 and used until 1937. Sauerkraut, Eddie and Rumi were on the porch and Zane arrived just ahead of me. We went inside and there were two rows of desks with a wood stove in the center of the room. The blackboard had a short history, and on a podium they had the original rules for teachers and the punishments for students for very specific things, along with the number of lashes they would get if they did each thing. It was all interesting and funny. How times have changed! I took a picture of them, but my favorite was the rule that if a teacher got shaved in a barber shop, it would put his integrity, worth and intention into question. Interesting.... 
Lindamood is famous for having trail magic, and it was locked and loaded today. They had three or four chests full of stuff in the back. One had cold soft drinks, another had snacks, another had staples and first aid supplies,etc. it was pretty amazing! It was definitely the most comprehensive trail magic I have seen yet.  They had mugs root beer, so I jumped on that. I had some cookies and mini snickers. As we were feasting a girl drove up. Her name was Moxie, a previous thru hiker, and she was coming to check on the trail magic. We thanked her profusely and talked for a bit. After that we headed to the Settlers Museum just a short walk up the road. They had early settler recipe books with things like possum stew, and exhibits of farming tools. They had an old apple cider press that was cool. There was a lot of history on immigration into the area, particularly on the Scots-Irish. 
I made a pit stop at the bathroom there because, well, it was an actual toilet and a sink with soap. Clean hands!!! Back at the schoolhouse Eddie, Rumi, and Sauerkraut were suiting up to go. I headed my pregnant pack on and we all headed out. There was a cool AT symbol painted on the rural road here as the trail marker leading into a meadow, so I snapped a photo of it. Next stop, Atkins! 
The trail wandered through fields and open terrain, as well as thickets with thick brambles. I often wonder how birds can navigate those thickets so nimbly. They thrive in them, and I get that they are small birds, but it still impresses me. The trail doesn’t go through the heart of Atkins, but it passes by two gas stations (Sunoco and Exxon), as well as a restaurant called The Barn. We had been warned by a section hiker that a few people had recently gotten sick at the Barn, so we did not plan to go. Later we would hear from others who ate there with no issues. There is also a Mexican restaurant attached to Exxon, sort of like a truck stop cafe. Right before we got into Atkins we saw a guy just sitting in the bushes off of the trail. He was friendly enough, but it was a little weird and we weren’t sure what he was doing there. It was by no means a scenic point or a camp spot, or even much of a clearing at all.... 30 yards or so later the trail opened up to a road and we crossed it to get to Sunoco. We dropped our packs outside and went inside to refresh ourselves in the bathroom and get some snacks. I went to the bathroom and wasn’t sure if it was a single, so I opened the door carefully. The room was dark, so I pushed the door open, took one step towards the urinal, and heard a voice say “thank you.” After the semi weirdness with the guy in the bushes just outside of town, I almost jumped out of my skin. Then the guy kept talking and I realized he was in the stall. He said that the light had been off for about 5 minutes and started cursing about how he couldn’t even poop in peace  there because the light just kept timing out on him. He had tried opening the stall door and waiving his hand, but the sensor was way out of reach. The whole thing ended up being kind of funny, though he was still mumbling when I left. 
I grabbed some snacks - a Yoo-hoo, a spicy V8, peanut butter M&Ms, and a Mayfield ice cream sandwich. I paid for them and went outside to sit by my pack, but someone had parked a huge motorcycle in front of the packs and so I sat away from them on a bench on the other side of the shop entry door. I drank my Yoo-hoo and ate my ice cream sandwich. After all the trail magic and this, and the food from Marion yesterday, I was feeling good and a little sugared out. Sauerkraut came out and talked with the guy on the bike a bit, and the bike man took off. I went back over to the bags where Sauerkraut was as I tackled my V8. A truck pulled up as Eddie and Rumi walked out of the store and an older gentleman hopped out and let out a weird kind of cackley cry as he did so. It was sort of like “yeeeeheeaaaa.” Maybe. I’m not sure I am recreating it properly. It was weird. Anyway, he had this kind of crazy look in his eyes but he was friendly and immediately told us he had done the trail in ‘68. He started warning us about bears. I’ve found this to be a common topic with town locals - bears and weather. He had a cute little dog in the passenger seat that looked like some kind of terrier mix. He finally went in the store and as soon as he did the dog started barking at us. It was time to move on. 
The trail through the outskirts of Atkins leaves Sunoco and heads up the road towards The Barn. We hung a left in front of an Exxon as the trail headed out of town. There was a Mexican restaurant in the Exxon. On another day I probably would have stopped to check that out, but today I’d had enough food for now, believe it or not! We pushed on as the trail crossed a highway exit and entrance ramp, and then wound back through brushy thickets into the woods. Everything around us seemed to be named Davis this and Davis that. We passed the Davis cemetery and then paused at a stream to get water. We decided to stay at a place called the Davis Path campsite, which was basically just a campsite right off the AT that had a privy. It was about the right distance for the day. There was no water there, so we stopped to gather all the water we would need and pack it out. We had some climbing left to do, but somehow I powered up the hills despite my bag full of food and carrying 3 liters of water. We got to the campsite and it was small, but perfect, and even had a picnic table. It only really has one level tenting spot though. The spot I chose was on a pitch, but I would make it work. We got ourselves set up and looked around for places to hang food. That was tough as well. The ridge behind us was steep, and it dropped off even steeper on the east side of the trail. I ended up climbing up the ridge to the west and found a tree up there. When I went back down I commented that we might get a good sunset view if we climbed to the top of the ridge, and so we decided to do that. We all brought snacks. I took a smoked salmon packet, avocado, hot sauce from Taco Bell, and Fritos (for some trail guac). It was an awesome sunset and we had fun eating and chatting while it made our day complete. Afterward, we climbed, slid and ran a little down the steep hill back to camp. We chatted about all sorts of stuff and really had a great time at camp. What we didn’t talk about was that we had passed the quarter way point, just shortly before the campsite at mile 547.7. I didn’t realize it until we saw a photographed an older quarter way sign the next day. We had completed one fourth of our journey, but in some ways the success of that manifested in the fact that we didn’t even mention it. We were living in the moment, and that is what I, for one, had come out here to do. 
I had one last climb up the hill to get my food bag hung. It was so hard to lift the weight of it in the tree that I used my gloves to prevent rope burn. Oh well - I’ll definitely eat it! I scrambled down the hill and got in my tent. As I was getting situated, a small white spider crawled over my leg. It was so light that I couldn’t even feel it on my leg. I grabbed a tissue and squashed it. I felt kind of bad, but for any spider that looks like it could bite I kind of have an “if you’re in my tent and I can’t easily flick you out, the gloves are off and tissues are out” rule. I have two little side pockets in my tent and I usually put any night trash like that in them, then transfer it to my food trash bag in the morning when I get my bag down. I stashed it there for later, along with a tissue I blew my nose with to make sure I didn’t accidentally litter in the morning. The Big Dipper was shining bright above us. In the distance we heard a train passing through Atkins. All was right with the world.  
Postscript:
#1 - thanks Eric for the correction via the guest book! Yes, the trash can and bathroom I mentioned in the Buzzard Rock to Mt. Rogers section should have been noted as at Elk Garden trailhead on Whitetop Road. Good catch! It’s hard to keep this stuff straight sometimes when I’m thinking back on the day with bleary eyes in my sleeping bag.","Partnership Shelter

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586857,"I woke up before light and laid in my tent for a bit. I went outside to pee, then crawled back in and tried to decide if I wanted to start packing up, or just lay there for a bit longer. In making such a decision, I was really just laying there for a bit longer. Suddenly I heard an incredibly loud owl call. it sounded like it was right over by Sauerkraut’s hammock! Maybe the owl was telling him to wake up. I believe the owls we have been hearing are great horned owls, but I am not sure. They make a very traditional owl noise, unlike something like a screech owl, which basically sounds like some kind of assault in progress. 
I made the climb to get my humongous food bag down from the ridge. When I got back, as I packed up my tent I pulled the trash tissue out of it. I figured I would blow my nose in it again to save tissue, so I did. I then realized I blew my nose all over the dead spider I squashed! Wrong tissue..... after picking up camp, we all had breakfast and good conversation over it. Two gents who looked like thru hikers passed by our campsite as we ate. Sauerkraut and I had both become mildly obsessed with stopping at A place called Brushy Mountain Outpost at mile 591.2. The challenge was that it was closed on Sundays. They had some resupply items, but the real motivation was food - burgers and milkshakes made onsite. We were even discussing hiking big miles today to get to Chestnut Knob Shelter or just past it, and then getting up at 4am to hike into Brushy on Saturday. Food will make thru hikers do crazy things, especially when it is a specific food craving or destination. Eddie and Rumi were walking a short day to a hostel, so Sauerkraut and I headed out. As an aside, I wanted to explain Rumi’s name. It comes from Ruminant, which basically means having a stomach with four compartments, like a cow. Someone saw her eating a lot of food and called her that. Her and Eddie joked about changing it to Hungry Cat II, since she goes by Kat in real life. I think Rumi will continue to stick at this point though.
I cruised along hiking the various ups and downs. I met up with Sauerkraut just after passing an old quarter way sign, presumably from a year when the AT mileage was different. It was at that point that I realized though that we really had gone a quarter way. It feels like the time has gone so fast. I don’t feel like I’ve been living in the woods for that long.... As we both filtered some water and discussed this, a young couple trotted up. Their names were Apollo and Skutch and they were thru hikers from Ohio. I didn’t get the details on Apollo’s trail name, but Skutch is interesting. Apparently Apollo’s grandfather is Italian and used to call his wife that. Thinking it was an affectionate nickname, Apollo called his girlfriend with that term of endearment. They later found out it is some kind of Italian slang for pain in the butt! They are both runners, but apparently Apollo has placed pretty highly in the Boston Marathon before. They were telling me about some crazy intense race called the Barkley Marathon, but then I had to drop out of the pack to pee. 
I hiked on my own for a while and as we descended in elevation I found some nice patches of violets and ate some. It’s one of the several edible plants I can identify. I walked along beside pasture land and then out into an open pasture. The day was getting quite hot! It felt like it was about 80 degrees. I saw Sauerkraut up ahead going over a cattle fence ladder. I joined him on the other side and found some nice patches of chickweed there and ate some of that as well. I mixed a bit of wild onion stem in with it and had some trailside salad. We hiked on and up the rolling pasture hills with incredible views of the little valley we were in. It was HOT! I was sweating buckets and stopped to put some sunscreen on. I hiked on and eventually came to a pretty creek near a farm. I crossed over it as the trail climbed up its bank along the ridge on the other side. There was a creepy looking old barn that had definitely seen better days on the other side of the river. I hiked past that and past where Sauerkraut was taking a break, and then out of the forest into a meadow again. I ran into three lady hikers there in the heat under the blazing sun. One was named Nat Geo because she knew a lot about local flora, another was named Navigator. I can’t remember the third lady’s name. I kept pushing on and I knew I needed to take a break. I wanted to air out my feet, change my socks, and try to wet wipe off some salt deposits to avoid chafing. I also wanted to eat lunch. 
After a bit I came to a road crossing. Just past that was a campsite along Possum Creek. It was the perfect spot for a break. I did everything I had planned to do in terms of tending to my feet, etc, and ate a nice big lunch. Sauerkraut joined me and did much of the same. I left feeling energized, but the climb out of Possum Creek was steep, and soon I was just hot and sweaty again.
I finally stopped at Knot Maul Shelter to sign the log and break for a few minutes in the shade. Sauerkraut caught up and we continued on after briefly seeing the lady hikers again and Dimples, who had been at a hostel the night before. We refilled our waters and charged on. At the shelter one of the ladies had a thermometer on her bag. It read 82 degrees. It was definitely and adjustment and a change from the cold! We started another big climb and kept pushing and pushing up the hill. It was tough hiking in the heat. After the long climb we descended back into the woods and both kind of decided that there was no way to make Chestnut Knob shelter. It was too hot and we just needed to accept that it wouldn’t happen. We came upon a large creek with a bridge crossing over it. There were camping spots around it and it was quite beautiful. After consulting the guide, we figured out it was Lick Creek. It was five o’clock - quittin’ time - so we both happily laid down our packs and worked on setting up camp. An older gentleman named Captain America was camped across the river, and Wallace showed up and camped as well. Dimples passed through saying she was going to push on to Chestnut Knob. 
Sauerkraut and I came to acceptance that we would not make Brushy Mountain Outpost by Saturday. We began to think about a new scheme though. We joked about maybe having a short day and camping near it, or behind it. This would later morph and play out in an interesting way. I learned tonight that Wallace’s trail name is after his dog. His dog was killed by another dog about a year prior. Wallace is a vet from Tennessee and that’s about all I know about him thus far. 
I was grateful for the beautiful views today, especially the valley meadow views. I was thankful to find some natural nutrition in the meadow, the oasis to cool off at Possum Creek, and for the ability to stop pushing and start relaxing when the day got tough. Tomorrow will be another hot one.","Davis Path Campsite at Mile 548.5

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586866,"At camp last night I rinsed out my shirt and shorts. I strung up small laundry line inside my tent since they were not yet dry when I went to bed. This would work fine under normal circumstances, but I had set my tent up on a slight pitch. I wanted my vestibule to open out to the creek, but usually I sleep with my head by the vestibule. I didn’t want all of the blood to flow to my head, so I had to change my position and sleep with my head at the back of my tent where the clearance was lower. Long story short, the clothesline dipped my shorts just over my face. That was my morning wake up view!
I had my coffee and breakfast. It had been nice sleeping to the sound of the stream. At some point last night and early this morning some kind of animal came down to the creek. I’m guessing deer but it’s hard to say. At around 5am something woke me walking behind my tent. I’d guess it was a small deer or a raccoon. 
I discussed a potential plan with Sauerkraut of aiming for Jenkins shelter tonight if possible. Then on Sunday we could hike to Brushy Mountain and camp nearby, hopefully somewhere outside the shop! Monday morning we would eat there and be on our way. We were starting to get funny notions in our head that they might have a soda machine outside, a covered patio, a water spicket,  and some outdoor electrical outlets. Oh - and ATT cell service. We joked about this but we both knew we were hoping for it. I headed out of camp first. 
Walking along in the morning is so peaceful. I listened to the birds sing as I hopped across little creeks. It was chilly to start, which was fine as I had my long sleeve and pants on while my T-shirt and shorts continued to dry on the back of my pack. I came to a road crossing and Captain America was there, smoking a cigarette. He said he was texting his wife. I, of course, had no ATT signal, so I started the big climb for the day that would eventually take me to the top of Chestnut Knob. It was a big climb, but there were decent switchbacks and I was feeling good. I drank a lot of water to try and stay a bit cooler, and to hydrate. I passed Wallace taking a break. He said he was also targeting Jenkins Shelter. I kept climbing and eventually got to a kind of grassy, bald looking meadow with a small pond and a stream. It was the best water source for Chestnut Knob, so I filled up. I also spread out my tent tarp to dry and let my feet air out. Wallace and Sauerkraut arrived and got water, then headed off. I changed into my shorts and t shirt, which were now mostly dry, and then  hiked on. Bear Meat had dropped me a text warning me to be sure to get water at Walker Gap after Chestnut Knob. Apparently water was scarce after Walker Gap until almost to Jenkins Shelter. By scarce I mean none!
I hiked the rest of the way up the grassy meadow bald to Chestnut Knob Shelter, which is actually enclosed with a door due to the wind up there. It was kind of cool inside, but I have not stayed at an enclosed shelter yet and wondered if it would feel claustrophobic at all. Sauerkraut and Wallace were outside taking in the view. It was a lovely view indeed! Wallace described it as “God’s Thumbprint.” It was hard to disagree with that. After appreciating the view, I hiked on. The ridge continued for a bit and then dropped into Walker Gap. I made sure to fill up on water, and had told the others about Bear Meat’s recommendation. There were a few young kids at the campsite at Walker Gap. Wallace was drinking a beer with one of them when I passed by him. I put on some sunscreen before leaving the water source. It was again very hot and sunny.
The climb out of Walker Gap really wasn’t that difficult, but it was hot. Once I was up on the ridge, I spent a lot of the afternoon there just kind of going up and down, up and down. Some of the terrain was pretty technical. I looked for a lunch spot in the shade but struggled to find one, so I settled for a nice rock instead. I kicked off my shoes and socks and had a lovely little lunch on that rock. There were a lot of flies out enjoying the heat, but the cross breeze was strong enough to chase them away periodically. 
After lunch I carried on my merry way, singing to myself and hopping from rock to rock. I was still on a Billy Joel kick, so I sang “Don’t Ask Me Why.” As the song goes, don’t look for answers, just take your chances, don’t ask me why. Done, done, done! I passed a group of kids hiking with a guy who said he was a meteorologist. We talked about the expected storms tomorrow. I kept on going feeling strong and taking in the beautiful views on the ridge. After a while I dropped down again to a road crossing. I walked through a parking lot and across to what I thought was a trash can based on a Guthook comment. It was actually a can of bags of wood chips for the mouldering privy at Jenkins Shelter and a sign explaining that, stating that it was not a trashcan, and then requesting hikers to take bags of chips up to the shelter. I opened the barrel. There were no chips in it, but I could see where people had dropped a fair bit of trash in it. I’m sure the people who tend to the blue barrels love that.
I kept on going and when I started getting close to the shelter I passed a female hiker who looked familiar. I couldn’t quite place it, but I knew I had met her before. I said hello and found out her name was Shocktop, after the beer. Apparently she had done trail magic one time and brought that beer to a shelter. She said she was from Centerville, VA and was hiking the section from Damascus to Pearisburg. She wasn’t having the easiest of days as it was tough and technical going in the heat. She was headed to Jenkins, so I told her I’d see her at camp and hiked on. At this point I was getting pretty thirsty. I was close to the shelter though, within 2 miles, so I just pushed on. 
I was the first one to arrive at the shelter. I stakes out a spot with my sleeping pad/bag and went to get water. I washed up a bit in the stream as well. As I was getting organized Sauerkraut arrived, then Wallace, and then Shocktop. Wallace and I were the only ones staying in the shelter. I rinsed my t shirt and shorts lightly in the creek and hung them to dry. We all chatted at the picnic table for a while and ate our dinners, and then MacGyver showed up. He said he had seen a baby bear about 6 miles back and had gotten a video of it. I watched it and, sure enough, back on the ridge a baby bear had crossed over the trail and then retreated back the other way, presumably going back to mama. When a baby bear appears, the question is always “where is mama,” because she is never very far away. 
Sauerkraut and I decided that on Sunday we would hike a short day to Bushy Mountain Outpost and, since it would be closed, figure out a game plan after that for stealth camping. We knew it was supposed to rain and produce a few thunderstorms, but it was hard to tell when that would start. The mosquitos and buzzy things were out now with the warmer temperatures. I had to stop journaling because the light from my phone attracted Mothra into the shelter. At first I thought it was a bat, but it was just a giant moth. I wore a bug net over my  face to keep the mosquitos off of me. The Low was supposed to be 60, so I barely needed my sleeping bag.  As I was just settling down to sleep, all of a sudden some coyotes started calling back and forth and howling. They were so close, and on both sides of camp! It sounded like a couple were down at our water source and the others were just back above camp near the privy. It was both unnerving and awesome at the same time!   I wish I had recorded it. They moved on fairly quickly into the night. 
Today was awesome! I had a great day hiking and was grateful for the views, clear weather, and that my legs felt good for the day. I took the tape off my heels to check them out and everything is healed. The skin is still a bit new so I will tape them again before heading into wet weather tomorrow. Now I must lie low to avoid mothra ....","Lick Creek Campsite Mile 563.5

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587202,"The nighttime temperature only dipped down to about 60, so I never really even zipped my sleeping bag up. It was my warmest night yet. I kept the foot box of my bag zipped to keep mosquitos off my feet and keep them warm, then just slept in my clothes (permethrin treated) with the bag pulled lightly and partially over my body and my bug net on my face. I slept fine that way. I expected to wake to rain, but instead the skies were just ominous. As we all readied our respective breakfasts though, it did feel like a downpour was coming. I had my usual breakfast of coffee and oatmeal. I also had pop tarts with Jif Maple and a honeybun because, well, I’m Hungry Cat. Sauerkraut and I still had the plan of trying to find a place to camp at or near Brushy Mountain Outpost, and with that in mind I hit the trail. 
The morning was a little eery at first. Nature tells me when a storm is brewing. When the birds stop singing in the morning, it’s because they know what’s coming. If the mosquitos aren’t out and they should be, something is up. It started to drizzle a little bit. I had my pack cover on and my rain gear ready, but I was still hiking in shorts and a t-shirt. It would start to rain a little, then I would turn a corner and it would stop. In some ways it was perfect hiking weather because it never really rained to the point that I got saturated. My body heat would evaporate the moisture as it accumulated.
While it was overcast, there were still some views here and there of the valley below, often shrouded in beautiful puffy grey rain clouds. Sauerkraut caught up with me and we hiked together, determined to reach the outpost so we could figure out what came next. As we got closer to town, we stumbled on some trail magic just before a road crossing. It was bottles of water and a nice, hand drawn map of surrounding amenities! We were excited about the water because we had carried in extra, but if we camped near the outpost we would probably need more. The map also ID’d the location of a trash can at the road crossing - bonus!! I took a picture of the map. We passed a huge cell tower and my AT&T service immediately went to full reception, a rarity on the trail. The path then took us down a winding dirt road. As we turned a corner we saw a church and a building next to it with people outside, presumably for Sunday service. Then we saw a small white building, and before I could read the sign above it Sauerkraut said “it says ‘Yes, we’re open’!” What?!?! I was skeptical as I had just called yesterday and they had confirmed they would not be open, but we practically ran down the hill. We had to see. We headed to the door and, sure enough, there was a neon “open” sign glowing its enticing red glow. I thought I might cry. 
To the right of the building was a covered pavilion with picnic tables and a trash can, so we set our packs and trekking poles/stick there and went in. Oh, sweet heaven on earth! What were the chances of the outpost being open? A voice piped up, “I’ll be with you shortly,” and I saw a gentleman in the back making something. I turned around and saw Wallace sitting in the back. He had just eaten a burger and was working on his fries. The shop had drinks and snacks and basic resupply items. I just wanted to have a meal and maybe take a snack for later. When the proprietor came to the front, I told him I had called yesterday and asked him why the nice surprise. He said he had been thinking about testing out Sundays now and had seen Wallace standing around, so he figured he would open the store up. I guess he also knew a few more of us would trickle through since I had phoned him. Once again, and in a very unexpected way, the trail provides! I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with Texas toast as the bun, a side of Cajun fries, and a strawberry cheesecake milkshake. I also got a V8 and a Dr. Pepper. We sat down at a table with Wallace and started to eat. The food was amazing! I downed my burger in no time, then polished off the fries and the milkshake. I ordered another milkshake. It was that good! Outside the rain had begun to fall. It was pouring and the wind was adding a nice, powerful slant to the rain. A flash of lightning accompanied what seemed to be buckets of water falling out of the sky. I worked on my second milkshake and contemplated the timing of leaving. MacGyver, Apollo and Skutch had shown up and the couple ordered some food. The rain seemed to let up a bit, so I put on my rain gear and decided to head out. The others weren’t far behind. We all headed to Helveys Mill Shelter, just about 2 miles from the road. The nasty storms were supposed to continue, get worse, and then drop some snow later. And that’s exactly what happened....
The trail left the outpost and followed the road down to an entrance into the woods, where a flooded, muddy creek separated us from the trail continuing on the other side. Hmmmm..... the water wasn’t just muddy, it was road runoff chemical spill muddy, with a weird milky hue to the brown. Hiking through that might dissolve your legs!  I looked upstream and saw an area where the bank was close enough to jump. I called to Wallace, who had caught up with me, and as I did I heard a “kersploosh!” I looked downstream and saw Wallace with one leg up past his knee in the stream. Noooo! I hopped across and made my way back to the trail. He was already walking up ahead. Sometimes you get to a point where you are so wet it just doesn’t even matter anymore.
I hiked on and the rain continued to fall. My rain jacket and pants were saturated, and I was going as fast as possible so I didn’t really care about getting wetter anymore. Later I would discover that I had left my pit zips down. Whoops! I slammed on the gas and finally got to the shelter. When I arrived, there were two Budweiser beer tall boys sitting on the shelter floor as trail magic. Wallace rolled in and, knowing he was a beer drinker, I pushed them his way to share with Sourkraut (I just found out after all this time that he spells it “Sourkraut!”). As we started setting up camp, the snow started. Of course it did! The trail is funny like that. But, in a way, we need the challenging weather to truly appreciate the really beautiful weather. Later that night, those of us in the shelter heard a sudden SWOOSH of wing flapping. A wild turkey flew down into a tree near the shelter. I couldn’t help bu my wonder if he was hoping to go inside. Everything was wet - my socks, shoes, pack, but I was dry, warm and comfy in my sleeping bag.
Today I was grateful that the rain started late, but also super grateful that Brushy Mountain Outpost was open! I’m grateful we had a shelter to weather the storm, and for the good company of other hikers. Turkey, I would have let you roost next to me if you really wanted! Is that weird? I don’t think so....","Jenkins Shelter

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587205,"Waking up today was a bit of a flashback to the cold days I had experienced so regularly thus far. It only took a few warm ones to make me feel, somehow, that the bitter cold might not return. Silly me! This morning was also a flashback of how tough it can be to get moving when it’s cold. I remember in the Smokies when it was so hard to take that first step in getting out of the sleeping bag. Yet here I was again, waking up to a light rain/snow mix, and knowing that when I got out of my bag I would be cold, would have to put on wet socks and shoes, and have numb hands as I went about the morning routine. But, as the famous Confucius quote goes, “a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” I find this to be true in pursuing any task. To get going in the morning, I don’t need to think about walking the entire AT, or even getting to the next shelter. All I need to do is get into action - pick a task to get moving and do it. Inertia is my enemy out here when it is driven by fear or the desire to be comfortable a little longer. If I think too much, I get lost inside my own head and psych myself out. So, on the cold mornings, I try not to dwell on it too much - I just pick small tasks. Get up and pee. Put the sleeping bag away, etc etc. I use the same tactic when approaching other areas of my life that are challenging, complicated or overwhelming. I try to just “do the next right thing,” or “take a single step,” or “focus only on today,” and when things are tough or uncomfortable I have to remember “this too shall pass.” These little quips and sayings may seem obvious and cliche, but they really work for me, whether I am pursuing a fledgling goal like hiking the AT, starting a business, or trying to change or adopt a habit in my life. Taking a single step, choosing small approachable tasks, and getting into action keep me focused and moving. So, that’s what I did. 
I sat up in bag and out my fleece on. I hopped out of bag, peed, and retrieved my food bag. That wasn’t so bad! Now I was moving. The others were in various stages of motion too. Wallace, a guy named Redbird, Apollo and Skutch took off first. They were planning on stopping at Trent’s Grocery somewhere down the way about a half mile off the trail. I did not plan to do this as I would resupply in Pearisburg, and I would stay at Woods Hole Hostel the next day before resupplying in town. My plan was to make it to Dismal Falls, or just north of that, to make hiking into Woods Hole only a 10-12 mile day. I had my usual coffee and breakfast, talked with Sourkraut and MacGyver, then headed out. 
The day was full of ups and downs and lots of rocky ridge line walking. When I checked The weather it had said a 40% chance of precipitation, but it misted or sleeted off and on throughout the day. At one point during the hike I saw a little bird with yellow coloring. I am not sure what it was. I tried to get a picture but wasn’t quick enough. I thought back to the Golden Wing Warblers of Tennessee that I never saw. I’m not sure if it was that or something else. I loved it though! When I get a signal I can google to see what it could have been. 
On top of the first ridge the slanting sleet had me holding my trekking pole/stick with one hand, and my rain hood with the other to try to keep it shielding my face. The wind was strong! After that, the precipitation was much more manageable for a while. I descended down and crossed a large suspension bridge across a very flooded river. I hadn’t seen another soul all day. I trekked last the road to Trent’s Grocery and up a soggy climb around the side of a ridge. I came across a guy sitting to the side of the trail with two large dogs. I don’t think he was a thru hiker. One of the dogs acted like it wanted to eat my face. He restrained it. The other one just sat there. I had to walk between him and that dog, so I was nervous. I called out “hello!” He didn’t respond but knew I was there. As I walked by I asked how he was. I got kind of a grunt for a response. Maybe he wasn’t a fan of the weather.... Anyway, I pressed on and the trail got soggier and soggier. It was saturated from all the rain. I reached Dismal Falls tired and soggy, but I still wanted to see it, so I stashed my pack and took the 0.3 mile side trail down. It was awesome, in a flood stage kind of way! It wasn’t a tall waterfall - more of a ledge rapid - but it was cool to see and hear it. The power of the water was chilling. There was a log people had obviously used to cross over it - the water was just barely flowing over that log now, making it a very dangerous crossing for anyone who tried it. I took some time to absorb the scene, then headed back to the trail.
On my way back to the AT on the blue blaze trail I briefly met a hiker named Turtle Man. He was southbound and doing a flip flop hike, which basically means you start somewhere in the middle of the trail and work your way to one end, then go back to the middle and work your way to the other end. He said Woods Hole Hostel has been packed the other night and that I might want to call ahead and reserve a spot. As soon as I got back to the AT that’s exactly what I did. I’m glad I did this because now my bunk for Tuesday night was reserved, and I was about to lose cell service for the rest of the day. 
I hiked on past Dismal Falls. The trail got wetter and wetter. My feet were completely soaked. Every creek crossing was swollen from the rain. Originally I was going to camp after the falls, but the wetter I got, the more I started to think I might push all the way to the next shelter. I kept going. The creek crossings got more challenging. I saw Apollo and Kutch on the other side of a large one and I just tore through it without even trying to figure out a way and place upstream to get over the creek without getting wet. I tore through another one and passed Zane. I was determined to get to the shelter, and I also really wanted a spot at the shelter given the weather! It had started snowing again and was coming down pretty hard. I finally got to the shelter at about 7:30pm and there was one slot left! The other 4 gentlemen who were there were really nice and made room for me. There was The Colonel, Underdog, Trucker, and Wandering Dad. I had to go back down the hill from whence I came to get water, and who came marching in but Sourkraut! Then not too far behind him came MacGyver. We hadn’t planned on hiking this far, but the weather made everyone push for it. As I cooked my dinner in the dark, I watched mice peek their heads out from under the shelter, then scurry away.
I was grateful for the yellow bird sighting today and the strength to hike as far as I did! I was also grateful for my time hiking alone today - it allowed me to check out a little bit, which was nice. Tomorrow morning is going to be a frozen one!","Helveys Mill Shelter
",Wapiti Shelter,"Apr 16, Mon",24.20
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587361,"I woke first just before 6am. I could see Colonel sitting up on the edge of the shelter smoking a small cigar. I wondered what he was thinking about there in the dark and cold. I burrowed back into my sleeping bag and dozed a bit. At 6:30 I got up to go to the bathroom and Colonel was back in his bag. I climbed back into mine afterward to get warm. The good news was that it was no longer snowing. I laid there as the first hints of light spread into the sky, slowly dissolving away the darkness. The other gentlemen in the shelter were sleeping heads facing out. I like to have my head away from the elements, so my head was facing in. When I propped myself up, I had a cool view looking out from the shelter at first light, with the silhouettes of our packs hanging from the edge of the roof of the shelter in the foreground. I took a quick picture from my bag. The other guys started stirring to life, so I hopped up eager to get about my morning and head on to Woods Hole. I wanted to get there early enough to get laundry done, relax, and enjoy the hostel. I also wanted to try to postpone my morning business, skip the privy and go at Woods Hole. It was too cold and, truth be told, bathrooms are a luxury for us!
I took down my and Sourkraut’s food bags (we hung them on one line), packed up my sleeping pad and bag, and set about boiling water for breakfast. In Marion there was no outfitter and the only kind of gas I could find for my stove was Coleman brand at Walmart. I had never used it before. Some hikers have had no issues, but this canister was giving me problems. I think the blend just wasn’t blended well. It worked a little better if I kept it in my pocket for 20 minutes and then shook it vigorously, but I still had to grab the stove while it was lit, lift my pot off, and shake the stove and gas canister at intervals to perk up the flame. You can imagine what a safe activity that is! Just picture me holding blowtorch and shaking it vigorously back and forth. I planned to ditch this canister at Woods Hole and get a new one in Pearisburg the next day. Luckily for me there is an outfitter right next to the Pearisburg post office.
My coffee and oatmeal helped to warm me up. I was waiting until the last minute to do what I had to do to head out, which was put on my frozen shoes. I had opened them nice and wide last night to make it easier. Not surprisingly, it was a LOT easier to get frozen trail runners on than frozen boots. It also didn’t feel nearly as uncomfortable; my feet thawed them quickly. I was excited by this small relief, remembering the pain I experienced with my frozen boots at Carver’s Gap in the Roan Highlands. Now I just needed to get moving to get warm! I said bye to my shelter mates, Apollo, Skutch and Sourkraut. MacGyver was off doing something, and Wallace and Redbird had already departed earlier.
It was only 7.2 miles to the road trail to Woods Hole, but the trail had a few morning surprises for us. I encountered about three more swollen creek crossings where I had to get creative and go off trail to find a way over them. I really didn’t want to get my already wet feet any wetter. This morning I had left my dry socks that I slept in on. My others were completely frozen and I would do laundry at the hostel anyway, so while my frozen shoes were making them wet, they weren’t soaking wet. I really wanted to keep it that way. I managed to navigate the creek crossings, but then passed through a few sections of trail where the trail itself had formed into a creek with runoff and snow melt flowing down the mountain. I stepped in several water pockets that went over my feet. Oh well - wet feet for 7 miles isn’t a biggie when the laundry machine awaits! I marched on. I got a cell phone signal at some point and checked in with Gillian. I knew I wouldn’t have one at Woods Hole.  When I was about 2 miles out, Sourkraut caught up to me. We walked into Woods Hole together.
The hostel is down a gravel road less than a mile off the AT. The main house and bunkhouse were originally built in the 1800s (not as a hostel, but as a farmhouse and barn. They were converted in the 1980s to a hostel by the current owner’s grandparents. The property definitely feels like a farm with goats, pigs, dogs and cats around. Two work-for-stay people greeted us and helped us get settled in. They make smoothies from all natural ingredients, so I got a smoothie, and they had cookie bars and sodas at the bunkhouse. Everything was in the honor system, so we just rallied as we ate and then settled up at the end of our stay. The bunk room was cool. It had two floors and a common room downstairs with a fireplace. Unfortunately, the shower and bathroom either weren’t working or were closed due to freezing concerns. We were allowed to shower in the main house, but had to use an outhouse otherwise and didn’t have a sink to wash our hands in. Also, the outhouse was a mouldering privy and you’re not supposed to pee in those, so we just had to pee outside. There was, however, a water pump outside with potable water. I used that when brushing my teeth, for drinking water, and to try and rinse my hands. It seemed strange that those of us in the bunkhouse weren’t allowed to use the bathroom that the inside guests could use given none of the facilities advertised for the bunkhouse actually worked. I actually later asked the owner where we could pee (the bunkhouse was in the yard) and she said to pee in the woods, not the yard. The woods was up a very steep hill.
I got my laundry done and took a shower. As I went upstairs in the main house to shower, Bear Meat popped his head out of one of the rooms and said “I recognize that voice.” I was surprised as I didn’t expect to see them there - I thought they were days ahead of me! Turns out that he was a bit under the weather and had taken a zero day there to recover. I felt bad for him - feeling ill on the trail has got to be tough. I know I have been grateful that for my health so far. 
Back at the bunkhouse MacGyver had shown up. Wallace was there, and Apollo and Skutch had stopped by for a snack and to warm up, but then left to keep hiking. The owner Neville came in and made a kind of snippy remark at some food supply items on the common table. MacGyver had left them there and I guess that didn’t work for her world order. I put boots on one of the hiker boxes to elevate them in front of the fire to get them all dry. I wanted to use this wooden bench seat, but it was nailed to the floor. MacGyver and I improvised to get all of our shoes as directly in front of the wood pellet stove as possible, and the work-for-stay guy, Golden, helped us crank the stove. Golden then told me that some other hikers had used the wooden bench to dry shoes. I told him that was a great idea and I wanted to, but it was nailed to the floor and that the hiker box was working fine as a prop. He then got a funny look on his face and said “it wasn’t nailed to the floor before!” He kicked at it and realized I was right. Golden was funny though - he went and got a drill and freed the bench from the floor. I didn’t use it or move it, but it was cool of him to do that. I suspected that the owner nailed it down so that it couldn’t be moved for such purposes.
Some other folks showed up at the bunkhouse and I saw that Redbird was staying in the main house. He was sharing a room with another hiker - a big guy named Super Mario. Why? He looked just like Super Mario! He had a blue shirt and red suspenders and a mustache. He just needed the hat! He let us take a picture of him. One of the other things at Woods Hole is that you can participate by helping out with various chores and helping cook dinner. I decided to go help cook, so I headed to the main house. Wallace and Clooney were in the kitchen. It was a bit of chaos, but the work-for-stay girl (I can’t remember her name but she was really awesome!) gave me some tasks. I dried dishes, I washed dishes. Super Mario was helping Neville cook. Wallace helped make salad. Then, the work-for-stay girl told me I should get some cat time and she brought one of the four cats over for me to cuddle! His name was Blue and he had been napping. She handed him to me and he just lay there and fell asleep in my arms. I took him into the sitting room where Bear Meat and Wallace were chatting. Clooney took a picture of me with him. I then passed him off to Wallace, and he seamlessly fell asleep in his lap as well. Cats really know how to chill out!
At dinner we all held hands or linked arms and said our trail names, where we were from, and one thing we were grateful for. We then sat down and ate family style. We had homemade burritos which were awesome. The cheese for them was also homemade, as was some delicious bread. Dessert was homemade ice cream. 
I went back to the bunkhouse pretty full! I did some journaling but it wasn’t long before it was time to go to sleep. I had also purchased breakfast in the morning, so I was looking forward to that. I was so grateful to be warm and dry and well fed! I was also grateful for that lovely pellet stove to dry all of our shoes, and the great camaraderie in the bunkhouse and at dinner. It was also awesome to see Bear Meat and Clooney again, though I was sorry he was feeling a bit yucky.","Wapiti Shelter
",Woods Hole Hostel Mile 624.8,"Apr 17, Tue",7.20
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587363,"I slept well at Woods Hole and woke up pretty early, so I journaled for a little bit. Coffee was at 7:30 on the front porch of the main house, and breakfast was at 8. Today was already much warmer, and supposed to warm up throughout the day, so I put on my clean shorts and t-shirt and headed over for coffee. It was lovely having good coffee outside and chatting with everyone. Breakfast was good too, it was basically the same format - gratitude circle and then sit down to eat. There was sausage, grits with cheese, peach bread, orange juice, and leftover bread from last night. Breakfast was plated, unlike dinner where we all made our own burritos with the common ingredients. After breakfast, we were asked to strip our sheets off the bed and put them in a laundry basket, get new sheets and put them on the bed. This is part of the Woods Hole “culture” - you pitch in and help clean a bit. There was also a jar with little chores in it we were encouraged to pick from. I tidied up the game area in the bunkhouse. Others were still getting ready, but I settled up with Neville, said my “see you down the trails” to everyone, and hiked out. I know a lot of people love Woods Hole. In my opinion, it doesn’t even come close to being as nice as Mountain Harbour, just to compare it to places I’ve stayed so far. I also felt like some of the remarks and behavior of the owner were at odds with the culture that it was supposed to have. It kind of just felt like there was some weird tension there. Without going into more detail since this journal is just to document my experiences on the trail and not some kind of hostel review system, I probably wouldn’t stay there again, but given so many people like it I would say if someone was ready for a break from the trail the. Give it a try. Some people who were there with me loved it; others had similarly mixed feelings. In the end, I think the hostel proprietors really make the hostels what they are, which can be magical, mundane, or something in between. For me, Woods Hole was something in between and sometimes I didn’t like the proprietors tone towards other guests (not towards me). Overall I’m glad I went if for no reason than it was more interesting an experience than a hotel in Pearisburg probably would have been!
The morning was beautiful and warm! I hiked up the road and passed Redbird. After a while I arrived at Docs Knob Shelter. I went down to sign the log book and have a look. It had a really large deck built onto it. It would be a really nice shelter, albeit a small one, to stay at for anyone not going to Woods Hole. I carried on and hiked up to a ridge line with stunning views of the valley below. I followed this ridge line as it worked towards Pearisburg, and got views of the town as well. I saw a red-headed woodpecker swoop off of the ridge to a tree far below. Just before the descent from the ridge, there was a blue blaze trail to Angel’s Rest viewing rock, I walked down that and was rewarded with a fabulous view over Pearisburg. Someone had hung little Tibetan prayer flags at Angel’s Rest rock. 
I cruised down off the mountain and the scenery began to get greener. All the snow had melted and little woodland creatures, squirrels and chipmunks, were scurrying about. One chipmunk stopped mid trail to examine me - odd behavior for a chipmunk! When I got about 4 feet away he decided I was scary after all and ran to my left and hid behind a rock. As I walked past, I turned my head around to look just as he popped up to take a look at me. His little eyes got wide and her shot his head back down out of site. I have a fondness for chipmunks, though not for the ones that produce annoyingly pitched Christmas albums....
I made it to the point where the trail hits Cross Avenue, the road that arrives in town after 0.7 miles. The hike into Pearisburg had been about 11 miles and it was just about 12:30 - not bad! As I climbed the last little bit of trail down to the road, the nearby neighbor was shooting guns in his yard. Awesome.... I got down to the road, pointed myself to town and started walking. I hadn’t made it 10 feet and a lady sprung out of a parked van on the side of the road and said “hello hiker! I’ll give you a ride into town!” Wow! The trail really does provide. This lady was  known as Zerolicious and represented Angel’s Rest hostel in Pearisburg. Even though I wasn’t staying at her hostel, she still gave me a ride into town to the post office and was super friendly. I have heard really good things about Angel’s Rest, and Zerolicious really helped me out by saving me time and my feet from almost a mile walk! Just amazing....
I had things to do in Pearisburg. First, I needed to pick up a few boxes at the post office, then get a new fuel canister from the Pearis Mercantile next door, then resupply with enough food to get me to Daleville, and lastly, EAT! I had three packages at the post office. One was my new trekking poles. Another was a new sleeping pad, the thermarest neo Air xlite, as well as a few mountain house meals I used a gift card to purchase (thanks to my Infor team!!!!). The last was a new pack from Zpacks. I love my Osprey pack, but had been toying with switching it out before I started this journey. There are a few things I don’t love about the Osprey. It holds water when it rains, and the pack cover never covers everything. The harness system makes a lot of noise. It creaks often as I hike and that distracts from the sounds of nature. Weight - I will shave 3 lbs or more moving away from the osprey, and while that doesn’t sound like much, at this point in my trek I can confirm that it is a noticeable amount of weight over a long day! I also love trying out new gear, so for all of these reasons I invested in the new pack. 
The post office worker was super nice and didn’t mind me opening my boxes and spreading my gear all over the floor like the hiker trash I have become! I had to transfer everything to the new pack, and then I mailed home my osprey, as well as my old sleeping pad, my fleece, thermal tights, and a pair of underwear. It was sad mailing home the osprey. It really is a good pack and we have been through so much together on this trip. I still have clothes for cold weather, but felt I could live without a few things now that most of my hiking is at lower elevations than the Smokeys and areas of North Carolina and Tennessee. I have no doubt there is still more winter weather to come! 
It took me a while to do all of this at the post office. Wallace came in and we discussed meeting up later for Mexican food at a nearby restaurant. I went next door, purchased a gas canister at Pearis Mercantile, and walked up the street to Food Lion to get the remaining food I needed. As I arrived at the store I saw Eddie Steady and another hiker I recognized piling into a shuttle. I said hello and found out they were staying at Woods Hole and had gotten a shuttle into town. I asked them if they would take my old trekking pole and hiking stick back to Woods Hole and put them in the free hiker box area. I originally planned to drop them at Angel’s Rest, but it was getting late and this would save me a trip. Woods Hole was probably a better spot for them anyway, though I had needed them to make the trek into town. It was sad to see my hiking stick go! It really was a great stick, and somehow it got even clumsy me safely here in one piece all the way from the Grayson Highlands. Mr. Stick, I thank you for your service and I do hope that you can continue your magic in the hands of another good soul on the trail. Godspeed!
Eddie mentioned that Sourkraut had decided to stay at Woods Hole another day. That explained why Wallace and I hadn’t seen him in town. I did my best to shop quickly at Food Lion and I was very well behaved with the snacks, getting only some peanut butter M&Ms and a dark chocolate bar (good Beaker tip for the warmer days!). I got some fruit to eat. I’ve been really into tangelos lately. I also bought a mini blueberry pie and a smoothie drink. 
Wallace was outside eating some chicken fingers. We packed up our stuff and headed up the parking lot hill to the Mexican restaurant. It was about 4pm, so the restaurant was almost empty. We got a nice table in the back with an outlet so I could charge my phone and power bank. I had three enchiladas with beans and rice, chips and salsa, and Dr. Pepper. Sourkraut called me and said he had decided to stay another night at Woods Hole, but was now considering maybe hiking out. He was still mulling it over so we said our “see you down the trails” and I let Wallace know what was going on. The waiter was really nice and filled our water bottles before we left. 
It was hot outside! We left the restaurant at about 4:30 and our plan was to walk to the first campsite we saw out of town and settle in for the evening. Roughly 4.5 hours later we arrived at Rice Field Shelter 7 miles out of town.... We had walked and walked and walked and there just weren’t any good places to pitch two tents. Our walk out of Pearisburg took us past a huge chemical/polymer manufacturing campus right on the river. The campus was just as big as Pearisburg! Looking at the setup and the proximity to the town, not to mention the proximity to beautiful natural resources upon which such a facility would have a very detrimental impact, I have no doubt that company has Pearisburg nestled snugly in its wallet....
It was dark when Wallace and I finally made it to the shelter. Rice Field sits on top of a partial meadowy bald. A storm was coming in, so the winds were gusting quite high. It started raining shortly after I got my tent set up. I stayed up late organizing my food and my new pack a bit. I was grateful to finally be at camp, and grateful for Wallace’s good company today. I was also very excited to have a new sleeping pad and hoped it would work better for my hips. Time to find out! Zzzzzzzzzzz........","Woods Hole Hostel Mile 624.8
",Rice Field Shelter,"Apr 18, Wed",18.40
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587365,"I tried to sleep in a bit, and I guess I did when my bladder woke me at 7. The wind was howling outside and blowing rain into the side of my tent. I put on my rain gear and decided I would also get my food bag down. When I finished with that business, I took off my wet gear, crawled back into my bag and went back to sleep. I meant to  just rest for another 30-60 minutes tops; instead, I woke at quarter to 10! The rain had stopped, but the wind was still gusting and I could feel the temperature dropping. I popped out of my tent and everyone was gone. I somehow slept through everyone packing up and leaving. Wallace probably thought I was in a tent coma. I hurried to get my stuff together and break down my tent (a fun challenge in gusty winds!), then spread out some gear in the empty shelter to get more situated in my new pack while I boiled water for coffee. The new gas canister was so much better! Thankfully that issue was solved. I texted my wife that I was feeling a little low. The wind is a real challenge - it burns our faces in the warm weather and takes a cold day and makes it really sting. My hands were numb and my gear was wet and I was having an “enough of this winter!!!” moment. I felt better after I ate, had coffee, and then saw Colonel, Underdog, and Trucker right as I was about to leave. 
I headed out and one of the benefits of my sleeping in was a beautiful view off the bald. Early this morning it was foggy, grey and rainy, but the front was blowing through and while the sky still carried the hue of winter, visibility was good. I could see valley after valley after valley! I hiked on quickly to try and get warm. 
I spent most of the day on this blustery ridge line. I stopped once to tape up a hot spot on the ball of my right foot. I got to it early so it wasn’t a problem and the Leuko tape plus moleskin stopped it from feeling funny and prevented any blistering. I got beaten down by the cold wind all day, which made me quite tired and hungry. I must’ve eaten 5 cliff bars while hiking today. I also saw two goldfish crackers on the trail. I walked past them, and then actually decided to inspect them for eating and went back! I know that sounds gross, but I was hungry and they sparked a craving. Unfortunately, they were soggy so I left them for the birds (or someone else!). I did see lots of nice valley views on the ridge. It sleeted briefly a few times, but nothing stuck and it passed quickly each time. I didn’t see a sound until I was coming down from the ridge and ran into Remmy, whom I had met in the Hikers Inn bunkhouse in Damascus. He confessed to having a similarly tiring day as I had, and told me that Bear Meat and Clooney were still back behind me. It sounded like Bear Meat still wasn’t feeling 100% so they were taking it easy. I am sure I’ll see them down the trail at some point and I really hope he feels better soon!
I read about a camping spot called The Captain’s Place on this part of the trail. It was just up ahead of where I saw Remmy. It was closed, but in the past hikers could take a zip line across a river and then tent on The Captain’s property. It sounded awesome, but as it was not an option, I decided to look for a stealth campsite near there. I really don’t like getting to camp after dark. It was 5:30, which is a great time to stop when it is cold and camp chores can seem to take a bit longer. Lucky for me I found a wonderful little site right by a creek with a beautiful, small waterfall! It was perfect and exactly what I needed after a tough night and day. I was so happy to just have a cup of tea, eat and look at and listen to the water. I was grateful to have support today when I was feeling a little off, and grateful to get out of the wind and have an easier time finding an awesome camp site today. I ate all of the rest of my M&Ms, so I’d also like to say that I’m grateful they make a huge “sharing size” (aka hiker size!) bag. Time to go to sleep yet again. I will rise earlier tomorrow! I think the weather is supposed to be nicer tomorrow, but that is for tomorrow to show me tomorrow!","Rice Field Shelter

Just looking at the day’s new sky I could tell it was going to be a beautiful day. I got out of my tent, retrieved my food bag, and boiled water for coffee.

I hiked through rhododendron thickets and then along a river until I reached a large footbridge across the stream. I crossed over the bridge and then a road before I reentered the woods. After a big climb I was getting too hot, so I stripped off my jacket and change into my short sleeve shirt. I climbed a little further and reached Bailey Gap shelter. I spoke with some hikers I hadn’t met, as well as Cynthia and her dog Olive. Cynthia might be going by the trail name Torch, but she didn’t seem to onto trail names. 
Most of the morning was spent climbing a long, rocky ridge. I stayed on top of the ridge for a while, just weaving in between boulders. The hiking was good and I felt like I had a good rhythm. I got to a sunny campsite around 11:30 and decided to break for lunch. I needed to change out my socks and air my feet, dry out my tent footprint and sleeping bag, and eat. I placed everything out to dry and sat to chow down. A young guy and a Canadian couple I had met at the shelter earlier this morning stopped to say hello. I can’t remember their trail names. Cynthia and Olive stopped briefly as well. I had a tuna packet that had rice and beans in it, and tortillas with Jog Maple for lunch. 
I hiked on, planning on going about 17 miles to Laurel Creek Shelter. I made it to War Spur Shelter and saw Loner Boner hanging up a bunch of clothes on a clothesline there. I hadn’t seen him since the last shelter before Damascus! He calls himself the slowest thing on the trail, but he had been moving faster than I! I stopped to say hi and then to filter some water just after the shelter. At the creek there was a young couple just out for the day laying in a hammock on a small island in the creek. Once I had my water, I looked for a way to hope across the creek. It was a little precarious hopping the requisite rocks and I almost fell in! Once I got to the other side, I looked around and realized the trail didn’t cross the creek there. Drat! I thundered through the rhodo like a bull in a china shop looking for an easier place to get back to where I was. I ended up walking right by the couple’s hammock on their island. “Excuse me, pardon me, sorry to interrupt your private time on your intimate hammock island for two! Don’t mind me!” I made it back to the trail a bit embarrassed, and trekked on.
Around the bend from that lovely experience I heard the shrill, short cries of a bird of prey. I looked around and finally spotted some kind of hawk directly overhead. It was smallish and making a lot of racket, but when it took off to fly it did not look like a baby. I am not sure what kind of hawk it was. In Georgia we have a lot of red tailed hawks, but it did not look quite like one of those. I couldn’t see the coloring on its feathers to help with identification; I only saw its underbelly. 
Later in the day there was a big long climb  up to Kelly’s Knob. I saw Camo and Okie up there. I had met them way back at Uncle Johnny’s Nolichucky Hostel in Erwin, TN. The knob had fantastic views! I sat up on the craggy, southern portion of it and had a snack. Okie’s actual name is Kelly Keller, and my last name is Kelly, so we joked about that while sitting up there on our knob.
Laurel Creek Shelter was less than 2 miles from the knob, but I passed it by deciding to push a little over 2 more miles to a campsite. It was a good evening for hiking, and I also really wanted to make sure I get up to McAfee Knob, an iconic viewing point on the trail, on Sunday while the weather is still good. A few more miles today would help with that goal. I filtered water past the shelter and brought extra with me. Lately we have had some longer stretches between water sources, and I knew the campsite did not have water. Just around the bend from Laurel Creek I spooked a white-tailed deer, which bounded away across the trail and into a rhodo thicket. After climbing through a pine forest, the trail lush and cushy with needles, I went through several beautiful pastures. I saw three rabbits feeding in one, but they hopped away before I could get a picture. The sun low in the sky over the pasture was just gorgeous! 
I climbed the last pasture, entered the tree line and my camp site was right there, affording me a sunset view over the meadow while I cooked and set up camp. It was a lovely evening! I decided to get up earlier tomorrow, so I even pre dug a cat hole for the morning! It is supposed to get down to 28 tonight, but it sure doesn’t feel like it will at the moment!
I am so grateful for the gorgeous weather today, with a high of about 55. It was perfect hiking weather! I am grateful for the awesome woodland creatures I saw today, as well as the even keel day of solo hiking that I had. I can’t wait for tomorrow!

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587788,"When the day started today, I had a vague plan of walking just far enough to make sure I could get to McAfee Knob
tomorrow by early afternoon. I never intended to camp right at mile 700, let alone another “.1” to make my mileage for the day even. Sometimes things just occur. In the morning I first woke at 5, then got out of bag finally at 5:45. I made breakfast (e.g. boiled water for my coffee). It was a beautiful morning! Between 5am and 7am, the temperature continued to drop until there was a nice frost on the ground. It must have gotten down just to freezing. I was in shorts and a t shirt, but slapped my rain jacket on to keep warm while my body caught up and warmed up itself. I also wore my buff under my hat, and my gloves. I’ve found my head and hands to be the most flexible way to manage my body temperature. I’ll often hike without a jacket, but still have gloves on. It wasn’t so cold that it was debilitating; it was just cold enough to invigorate me. I said goodbye to my lovely temporary dwelling spot and headed north.
I walked through another pasture and happened upon a deer grazing off to the side. It froze in place and stared at me in what seemed to be either fear-laced curiosity or curiosity-laced fear. The
breath from its nostrils clouded the air in front of its face, just as my breath must have shrouded me. I tried to reach slowly for my phone to take a picture. It was enough for the deer, which bolted back to the nearby tree line and disappeared. Around the bend I saw three rabbits foraging in the taller grass of the meadow. It seemed that even the woodland creatures were excited to get an early start to what would be a beautiful day. Under their breath the rabbits probably took one look at me and whispered to each other: “short timer!”
I crossed a road and there was an old chimney in a rather sketchy looking parking lot. The Canadians passed by me last night and said they were going to camp there. Yikes! It was a little sketch for camping. I started up the hill and saw them at a much nicer spot with a fire going. I kept climbing and first passed by a broken down old shack. I got kind of a cool picture of it in the morning sun. I walked through more pasture, and there in front of me was a roughly 300 year old Keffer Oak. It’s said to be the oldest tree in the southern portion of the Appalachian trail. Apparently there is an older tree in New York that we will see later. It was pretty spectacular to see such an old tree. I liked thinking about what that tree has seen over 300 years. A revolution. A civil war. Wagons to automobiles. More than I will see in my life! I took a few pictures of the tree, trying not to get the nearby power lines in my photo. I felt bad for the tree having to look at those lines every day. 
The trail headed away from the pasture and climbed up Sinking Creek Mountain where there are a series of old and very large cairns, apparently constructed there by early farmers for navigation purposes. Not too long after this, I arrived at a marker for the Eastern Continental Divide. This one is fascinating to me. Streams on the east side of Sinking Creek Mountain flow into the James River and the Atlantic Ocean, and those on the west side flow into the Mississippi and Gulf of Mexico. I like thinking about the origin of water and it’s final pooling grounds. I stopped at Niday Shelter for lunch and there was a weekend hiker resting there as well. I dried out some gear, kicked off my shoes and ate. I didn’t get the guy’s name, but while we were chatting he said he was hiking south to McAfee Knob. I told him I was hiking north to McAfee. He got really quiet for about 5 minutes, and then told me he realized that he had parked at Dragon’s Tooth, which is south of McAfee Knob, and then hiked in the wrong direction! I felt for him because not only did he have quite a ways to hike back, it was also something I could definitely see myself doing. He trekked off no doubt frustrated! I headed downhill to grab water from the water source, put on some more sunscreen, and headed out myself. 
Next was a long, albeit nicely graded with switchbacks, climb up Brushy Mountain. At the base of the mountain I saw and took a picture of a bunch of what my mother would later identify as Dwarf Irises that looked like Rock Garden Irises. At the top of the mountain the trail leveled off and was really just a Jeep road for a while. A side trail lead to a monument for Audie Murphy, the most decorated WWII vet who  had died in a plane crash in the area. I took a picture of the monument and thought about how crazy it is that someone can go through so much in a war, being wounded multiple times, survive it all, and then die in a rather statistically unlikely manner, such as in a plane wreck. I suppose it is a good reminder that the order of the universe is not for me to understand.
I started the descent down Brushy and eventually got to a road crossing and parking lot where I saw my weekend hiker friend. He said his car was parked by Dragons Tooth, but that he would stop and camp there as he had already walked 26 miles. I felt bad for him, but he seemed to be taking it all in good spirits. I needed water, but I had a big climb to power through before the ridge leading up to Dragons Tooth, so I didn’t want to carry it. Instead, I did the climb and stopped at Pickle Branch Shelter. This was a little painful in itself because the shelter was 0.3 miles off the trail, and then another 100 yards down a steep hill for water. I met two section hikers there and chatted with them while I got 4 liters of water, drank a liter, and washed some salt off my face and arms in the creek. Climbing out of that shelter and back to the trail with at much water was a little painful, and I was already getting close to 6. I wanted to find a stealth campsite somewhere on the ridge just so I would have an easier day tomorrow getting to McAfee Knob. I walked by a few spots that were quite slanted. Stealth campsite selection has proven to be tricky for me. On some occasions I’ve walked farther than expected to find a site, and so I tend now to scrutinize them carefully before passing them over. It was getting late and the sun was going down. I was dog tired. I asked the trail to give me a sign. Not long after I did, I rounded a bend and surprised another deer that was just off the trail. This one didn’t run. It stood there staring at me. I stared back. For a second I thought it might charge me, but it looked young. Instead, it decided I was tolerable, lowered its head and continued foraging. I had never had this experience before, so I took a little video of the deer. I walked off and it stayed. I took that as my sign and took the next spot that afforded itself. I watched a gorgeous sunset as I hiked into and set up camp, and was poised to see a beautiful sunrise on the opposite side of the ridge in the morning. When I got in my tent, I checked my position on Guthook and was surprised to see that I was at the 700.1 mile mark. It felt like serendipity. The day, the deer sign, the trail, the sunset, had all lead me here. I was exhausted bu feeling in good spirits.
I was grateful for all of the wildlife sightings today, for my legs and body for carrying me through a long hot day, and for the trail for getting me to where I had landed that evening. Tomorrow will be a big day.Postscripts:
#1: I definitely have a lot of good reading material lined up for after my hike! I look forward to checking out how Kokopelli’s section went, checking out Beaker’s journal, and also the rescue entry that was just mentioned the other day in my guest book. Lots of good stuff and it will be nice to have trail-related reading post trail!
#2: While there is a way to get multiple pictures in the body of my journal entries, I think I have only done it once because I is cumbersome and requires some basic HTML entry that is just too much work on the trail for me! I do add lots of pictures though and try to label them in a useful way, so if you are interested they are in my photo gallery.","Campsite at Mile 677.1
",Stealth Campsite at Mile 700.1,"Apr 21, Sat",23
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587802,"I slept like a baby last night. I woke up early at abut 5:30 and tried to be efficient about getting breakfast going and packing up camp. I was on the trail hiking just before 7. The morning sunrise over the ridge was gorgeous, so I stopped to take a few pictures. The first point I would pass by this morning was Dragons Tooth. Well, I did pass by it. Somehow I missed the side trail for it. Oh well! I was so focused on the technical hiking i guess.... I didn’t even realize this until I was at McAfee Knob, just figuring that it was Dragons Tooth that I climbed down and that was why I didn’t notice it. That was not the case. The climb down from the side trail to Dragons Tooth, however, was very technical. It was more like bouldering, and at some points there were steel bars drilled into the rocks to provide footing. One wrong move here and I could be toast! I went very slowly. After I finished climbing down, the trail became a tad easier, but remained technical in some places until I got to the gradual descent to VA route 624 road crossing. A lot of hikers go to Catawba Grocery from this road, but I did not need to resupply at this point. I pressed on. I did stop to text my wife. I joked with her that if I had a fall bad enough to where I required a feeding tube, to please try and see if they can get a nice wide tube, ideally the diameter of a gutter drain spout. I can’t imagine dealing with hiker hunger and only having a food tube the size of a straw - madness! I need something you can roll up a whole pizza in and use some kind of ramrod to get it down into my stomach. Anyway, she agreed that if that scenario were to play out, she’d see what she could do. 
At some point i was in he woods and low on water, so I was trying to read some notes in Guthook about an upcoming water source. I looked up from my phone and there in front of me was a Doberman pinscher. It was not a happy and cheerful dog; rather, it was like some kind of demonic forest spirit from a horror movie. I just looked up and it had appeared out of no where, snarling and barking. My blood went cold. This seemed like a dicey situation. It had a collar on, but no one was around. It advanced and lunged closer snapping, but did not move in to bite me. I kept repeating “it’s ok, it’s ok! Good dog, good dog!” The dog did not like this. I had forgotten, too, how large Dobermans are. This dog could easily jump and knock me over. The dog kept snarling and barking and for a minute I thought “maybe I can give it a cliff bar....” I reached towards my hip belt and the dog started to come in at me. Nope! I reached away, the. Raised my trekking poles up a bit, trying to make myself look bigger. Then the nightmare got worse. ANOTHER identical looking Doberman came bounding over barking and snarling. I thought I was toast. They started trying to flank me, rushing in behind me until I spun to face them. I wasn’t going to go down without forcefully using the tips of my trekking poles. And then yet ANOTHER dog went bounding by. They all had collars, and yet no one was around to call them off. The third dog was some other breed and just kept running South. Ultimately, I think that dog saved me because the Dobermans became slightly more interested in it than in eating me. They circled around behind me and I spun around to face them, slowly walking backwards north down the trail. They ran south. I hiked quickly but quietly to get away, my heart pounding out of my chest. I honestly did not think I was going to make it out of there without getting attacked. I stopped at the water source, quite shaky. I have had trouble with loose dogs before, but this was probably the worst potential situation I have been in - 3 unfriendly dogs and no one else around. A hiker passed by heading south.  l called to him and warned him about the dogs. He said he hikes there regularly and has seen the dogs before and had similar issues. I tried to put it out of my mind and hike on, but for the next mile I was paranoid they might come back. They did not. Maybe they came after me because, at the end of the day, dogs chase cats. Who knows why....
I hiked past an old water wheel in a brook adjacent to the trail. I made my way down to the next road crossing and parking lot for McAfee Knob. It was quite the scene! I was jam packed with cars. The knob is a popular site because it is so iconic yet easy to reach. You can actually skip most of the AT and just walk up a forest road to see the knob. I walked to the end of the parking lot and saw Far Far standing with a couple of other thru hikers. I hadn’t seen him since just after our delicious breakfast feast at Mountain Harbour. Turns out he had taken a bad fall on the descent down from Dragons Tooth. His hand was all swollen. The whole story sounded really scary. I was glad he was ok, though his hand looked really bad. A bunch of hikers went to a restaurant about a mile and a half from this road crossing called The Homeplace. It is said to be quite good, but I decided I would rather get up to the knob than lose a good chunk of the day for a meal.
I started the climb up the hill to the knob. I was actually relieved that there was an easy trail to the knob for anyone not white blazing because it made the AT path a bit more serene. I cringed before the split off as a guy came down the hill with a boombox on his shoulder blaring music. He was talking about what a good core workout he was getting. I worked my way up the hill and past the two shelters before the Knob, which are in pretty close succession. I made it to the top. 
The views at the top were breathtaking. It was a clear day and it really was a heavenly view to behold. I saw one person go towards the edge for a picture at the knob. There were a handful of folks sitting around and enjoying the view, but no other thru hikers. I approached a girl sitting down and asked her if she might help me take a few photos. She asked if I was a thru hiker and I said yes. She was super cool and agreed to assist, as well as take some with her camera. I went out on the knob. This was it!! I had been waiting to have this experience and get this photo.  I hiked big miles over the last few days to make sure I got here with decent weather. I stepped out to the edge. Then I sat down with my legs over the edge. With my pack still on, it was a little awkward. I pictured myself tipping off into the abyss. Cats land in all fours right? I tried not to get woozy and just enjoy the view. It was incredible! 
When that was done, I walked over and thanked her profusely. I asked their names - her name was Melissa and his was Shane. They were from Lynchburg and were out for a few days of backpacking. I later learned that it was Shane’s first real backpacking trip. This was exciting news! He said he was really enjoying it so far and was ready to do more. Awesome! Is always fun to talk with people when they are first getting stuck into something new and exciting. There’s a certain energy and intoxication to it that I can relate to. It was awesome to see him enjoying his first trip. He told me e brought too much food, and of course my response was “better too much than not enough!”, thinking back to my day of starvation trying to hike to Mountain Harbour.  As we talked, another thru hiker named Wandering Dad showed up. Melissa helped him take pictures as well. I sat down and ate my lunch and chatted with them for a while. They said they had met Tennessee the other day and gave him some food. Sounds like I might run into him again soon. I haven’t seen him since Mountain Harbour. Melissa and Shane then continued to trail magic me by giving me some delicious snacks and taking all of my trash off my hands, which at this point was a pretty full gallon  bag of trash! They were super cool and I couldn’t have been more grateful to meet them and for their kindness. As they left the knob I had a “oh yeah, duh” moment. I had been pushing and planning to get to the knob today and I was worried about the weather and getting a good photo. None of that really mattered. In the end, the trail always shows me that the true experience, the real essence of the trail’s magic, comes through experiencing the completely unselfish, kind acts of strangers. Meeting these amazing people and engaging with them - feeling what it feels like to receive that kindness - that is the real gift. So yes, I do have pictures on the knob and I did upload two if you want to see them, but did not post them in this entry. I posted the picture of Melissa and Shane instead because they, among other people, really made my day and my McAfee Knob experience exhilarating. That’s real trail magic! Thank you both!!
I chatted with Wandering Dad a bit, finishing my snacks. A girl walked by with a Labrador puppy that had the silvery grey coloring of a Weimaraner. I have never seen a lab that color. He came over and licked my feet, which I was airing out. Poor dog!!!! Dirty, nasty clown hiker feet! I hope he lived through the evening. Speaking of other cool people who made my day, as Wandering Dad and I made our way along the trail and down from the knob, I ran into a couple heading Southbound. It kills me that I can’t remember their names because it was something clever such that each of their trail names together was a word or phrase. It’s been on the tip of my brain but I can’t remember!!! Anyway, she said that she reads my journal and wished us both luck on our hikes. I’m always amazed when someone I meet in person is reading my journal. It’s a surprising and very cool experience, and sometimes I still can’t believe that people enjoy reading my mental notes and ramblings on my trail experience. I’m super grateful for the support. I’m hoping you will comment in my guest book to remind me of your names - I’m sorry I forgot!
Just around the bend it happened again! I ran into a guy named Carlos coming southbound who shouted out “hey, are you The Cat?” He said his friend Steve was back a little ways. They were out for a section hike and Steve was enjoying reading my journal and thought, based on my updates, that he might run into me on the trail. That he did! WD and I walked a little farther and I saw a guy coming uphill and shouted “are you Steve?!” I told him I was Hungry Cat and Carlos had clued me in that he was reading my journal. It was fun and, again, just really cool to meet someone on the trail who is supporting me just by way of reading my ramblings. I took a picture with Steve, which is posted in my gallery. Steve and Carlos, it was awesome to meet you guys! I hope you enjoyed the rest of your hike!
I was pretty much on cloud nine by the time I got to Tinker Cliffs. Tinker is like McAfee Knob, but with more expansive cliffs and views. It’s absolutely breathtaking and some of the best views of the trail so far. Is also a bit less hectic than the knob. I was thoroughly impressed and stayed there a while to enjoy the views. 
I hiked on to Lambert’s Meadow Shelter, but decided to push closer to Daleville to stop for the night. I filtered extra water there to carry with me. WD showed up at the shelter and decided to stay. He said he was staying in Daleville tomorrow at the HoJo in case I wanted to take a quick shower and clean up after resupplying and before hitting the trail. This was an awesome offer! We exchanged numbers to connect tomorrow and I headed out. I ended up camping about 6.2 miles outside of town. I ate a red beans and rice Knorr rice side and went to bed completely exhausted. 
Today I was grateful for so many things I could basically write a book, but mostly I was just grateful for the kindness and support of others and to be able to see that first hand on the trail. I was also grateful I didn’t get eaten by a wild pack of dogs! That would have been an interesting end to this journal though! My trek continues on though and I will eat eat EAT in Daleville tomorrow, resupply and then punch out. It’s supposed to rain tomorrow starting sometime late morning. The weather looks really wet through Wednesday. Spring is coming though! The days feel a bit warmer and I can see the green on the trees slowly creeping up from the valley, gradually ending higher and higher in the tree line. Mother Nature is going green!Postscript:#1: Check out the “promposal” photo in my gallery from Tinker Cliffs. I said yes, but there was no one there to hear me.

",Stealth Campsite at Mile 723,"Apr 22, Sun",22.90
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587922,"I woke up to my alarm. I had set it because I had a goal - making breakfast in Daleville! I had 6.2 miles to hike to get there. I wanted time to eat, relax, resupply, and eat again (lunch) before hiking out of town. I organized myself pretty well last night to get out of camp reasonably quickly. I wasn’t having coffee or eating breakfast, so I packed all my stuff up, threw on my shorts and t shirt, and got to hiking. 
I love when I get going earlier in the morning. There is something special about watching and hearing the forest wake up. The way the light looks, the smell of the dew as the sun hits it, the sounds of the birds as they begin their morning calls - all of these things come together in a kind of magical symphony of sights, smells and sounds. I thought the hiking into Daleville would be pretty easy, but there were actually a handful of quite technical sections - boulders to climb over on the ridge lines, etc. I saw a guy meditating on a rock, or at least looking out over the beautiful view. I quietly hiked by. About 10 minutes later I heard something behind me and turned around. It was said guy, trail running in minimalist shoes that really might as well have been his bare feet. I watched him run past and quickly scramble up a steep boulder climb that was on front of me, then dash over the top of the ridge like a gazelle. I got to it and clawed my way up carefully with my trekking poles, slipping and stabbing desperately at the earth for some kind of friction. I made it up though with my own special “style.” As I got to the easier terrain I ran into a thru hiker who said his name was Zia Fox. He hiked behind me and talked on the way to the road crossing for Daleville. I pulled over to use the bathroom and let him go by. I needed some coffee before I could handle more chatting! I had skipped it this morning specifically because I knew there was a coffee place that served breakfast food in Daleville. I was very excited about this!
When I got to the road, I hung a left and walked towards everything I needed. The Kroger, coffee/breakfast place, outfitter, and three little pigs BBQ were all in the same shopping plaza, so it was incredibly convenient and easy. The walk was very short - maybe a quarter mile. I beelined for the breakfast place, and while I was looking over the menu, Tennessee walked in. I didn’t recognize him at first because he had shaved and didn’t have his orange Tennessee jacket on. He got a cup of coffee and I got coffee, French toast and scrambled eggs and a danish. We caught up on trail updates and whatnot - it was fun! I then went for a second meal and got an omelet with toast. Delicious! Before I left I took my Swiss Army knife to the bathroom with me and executed Operation Trim the Nose Hairs. Nothing like being a dirty hiker when you’re 40.... 
Tennessee went over to the outfitter while I finished my coffee, and I stopped in there briefly to purchase a fuel canister before going to Kroger to resupply. I actually did pretty well sticking to my shopping list. I also got a new toothbrush and some more toothpaste. My old toothbrush had definitely seen better days. For one of my meals I bought the ingredients to make a “ramen bomb.” I heard other hikers talking about these. Ramen bombs are when you make ramen noodles  with a little extra water, and then drop a starch in it like instant mashed potatoes. I plan to do it with some Idahoan mashed potatoes. It sounds amazing, so I’m pretty excited about eating it! I got enough food (I’m sure too much, but I like my snacks and “extras!”) for 4-5 days. I should be at the road crossing to get to Glasgow in 4 days, and that is where I will resupply next. Glasgow is roughly 5 miles off the trail, but the town actually has a free, town-provided shelter in the center of town with hot showers, a privy, and a tenting pavilion. It’s sounds both cool and smart (great way to keep hiker business coming into town). After I purchased my food, I sat down outside Kroger and broke everything down, threw out boxes, and organized my food by days like I always do. I drank a smoothie while I did that - it’s kind of a resupply tradition of mine. In Kroger I had seen Apollo and Skutch. They had said the BBQ joint was good, and it was time for me to head that way. 
When I got to three little pigs I saw Wandering Dad and Bama Dog and WD waived me over. Earlier I had exchanged texts with him and told him that, while I appreciated his offer, I wanted to hike out of town before the nasty rain, and so I would skip the shower. I’m pretty gross right now though. My t shirt looks like it has been tie dyed but it’s just salt stains from my sweat. Bama Dog left but WD had just ordered. I ordered a BBQ sandwich with vinegar-based sauce and Cajun chips. It was delicious! Three Little Pigs gives free banana pudding to hikers, so I ate that too. I took a picture of it because it was pretty decorative for banana pudding. It was divine and I ate it in about 30,seconds! The restaurant was super hiker friendly and even helped me fill up my water bottles. Over lunch WD told me that Captain Krispy was off the trail though. I knew he had gone back home to rest for a few days because his leg had really been bothering him. Apparently he went to the doctor only to find out he had stress fractured his femur!! No wonder it hurt so bad!! I was in shock at this news, and also kind of devastated for Captain. My hope is that he will be able to heal up and finish his hike before his school term starts, but I’m sure he has to play it by ear right now. Captain Krispy (or Momma Krispy), if you’re out there and see this, I’m so sorry that happened and I really hope you are able to come back from it! We all miss you on the trail and will send positive vibes your way - do let us know how you’re healing up! Also, as an aside, I got those mint chocolate chip builders bars you were really into. You were right - they are awesome!
Krispy’s injury shook me up, not just because I felt bad for him and want him to get well and be able to complete his hike, but also because it highlighted how quickly serious injuries can develop out here. I’ve heard of people getting off the trail for nasty infections, broken bones, and other reasons. To hear if this happening to someone much younger than me makes me feel a little like a ticking time bomb. I made a mental note to try to be extra careful not to push myself too hard. We finished up lunch and I went back over to the coffee house to grab one more cup of joe and charge my power bank a little more. Then it was time to head out!
My goal was simply to hike to the first shelter out of town and hopefully get there before the rain kicked in. I passed Bama Dog and two young hikers named Tarzan and Happy Feet. The rain, of course, did kick in, but it did not rain heavily enough for long enough at any point to make me stop and put on rain gear. I showed up at the shelter damp, but not soaking wet. Tennessee and Zia Fox were there, as well as Wallace! I didn’t think I would catch up to Wallace, so it was a surprise to see him there. We talked a bit and then I worked on journaling before bed. 
I was so grateful that the rain largely held off until I was close to the shelter, and grateful for the convenience and good food in Daleville. It was good to see old trail friends again. It’s funny how the passage of time is so different out here! As we lay in our sleeping bags the wind and rain picked up. Tomorrow is supposed to be a wet one....","Stealth Campsite at Mile 723

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587928,"As expected, we woke up to rain. I was in no hurry, so while Wallace, Bama Dog, and Zia headed out, I hung back and made coffee and breakfast with Tennessee. When I left the shelter, Tennessee was contemplating whether he wanted to hike or just hang in the shelter and stay out of the rain. The morning was definitely off to a soggy start! 
I made the decision to wear as few clothes as possible under my rain gear. When it really rains, rain gear quickly gets saturated. It does not really keep me dry. It basically keeps my drier than if I didn’t have it, but still wet. It does, however, help keep me warm. I decided to wear my t shirt but go commando under my rain pants.  No sense in even getting my underwear wet really! The rain picked up and I had to move at a quick pace to stay warm. My phone was in my dry bag in my pack since it was so wet, so I didn’t really stop to take pictures today, although honestly there wasn’t much that I probably would have photographed as the weather limited the views. Other than a few flooded creek crossings that were tricky (I completely submerged my right foot in one), the hiking and climbs today were relatively easy. It was a nice vacation for my feet! The trail crisscrossed with the Blue Ridge Parkway at a couple of points where cars could turn off of the highway to see views. No views today but grey, although at one point the clouds and fog shifted just enough for me to get a hint of a view. The turnoffs, however, has trash cans! That was exciting and I dumped all of my trash at the first one. 
My day went quickly because I was quite keen to get out of the rain. I got to Bobblets Shelter and was surprised no one else was there. That meant that Zia, Bama and Wallace were pushing to the next shelter for a 19 mile day. For me, it was quittin’ time and time to get dry! I stripped off my wet clothes and got changed, set up my pad and bag, and made a cup of tea. This shelter is really nice - good water source close by and a really big enclosed privy. 
After a bit, Tarzan and Happy Feet showed up and we chatted while they debated whether to stay or push on. They stayed given how wet it was and the fact that tomorrow’s forecast is also for rain. Another guy I hadn’t met before, Shark Bait, came and stayed as well. Then, while I was eating dinner, Nightmare, Finger Food, and Diablo rolled in! I hadn’t seen them since the Smokies. They were like a proper tramily now! It was good to see them and we caught up before it got dark. As we were eating dinner, Happy Feet spotted a deer feeding just up the path to the shelter. We watched it eat its dinner too!
I was grateful that it didn’t completely pour buckets all day today and that the rain was more on the gentle side after the first part of the morning. Also, at least it wasn’t snow! I was really grateful to have an earlier day and just enjoy talking with some hikers and getting to know them a bit. Tomorrow is supposed to be another wet one, and that’s ok.","Fullhardt Knob Shelter

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588050,"I knew it was supposed to rain today, and in particular in the morning. With my ear plugs in I slept soundly in the shelter. When I woke up and pulled them out, the first thing I heard was rain. Rain hitting the tin roof on the shelter. I could also hear the stream just behind the shelter gurgling away - a lovely sound. But the rain.... Even though I knew it would be raining, there was still a piece of me that hoped it would not be so. I didn’t wake up until 8. The others in the shelter were stirring, with a guy named Shark Bait heading out first. I boiled some water for coffee and ate my breakfast: two oatmeal packets and brown sugar cinnamon pop tarts with peanut butter on them. I love this breakfast and can’t seem to get tired of it. I worked on getting my sleeping bag put away in its dry sack, as well as my sleeping pad, and other various knickknacks. I’m still getting used to my organization system with the new zpacks pack, but so far I love it! It feels like I get smarter with it every day, making small changes. I had a little water come into it yesterday and realized it was because I only folded the roll top over 3 times, namely because my giant food bag was in it. I have a lot of experience with roll top dry bags due to my love for kayaking, and usually i have to roll the top over 5-7 times to keep the water out. Tarzan suggested putting my food bag on top on the outside - a great idea - so I would do this today and give it a whirl. Anyway, so far I’m really happy with the bag, and I love that it doesn’t make noise while I hike like the osprey did. I can focus on the sounds of nature.
I saved the best for last - putting on my wet socks, shoes, and shirt from yesterday. That’s probably the hardest part of the morning. Happy Feet has already headed out, so it was just Tarzan and I left having a race to see who could be last out of the shelter. I went to the privy. It was huge! It almost looked ADA compliant with its wide chamber and hand rails. I have not seen one like it yet. Tarzan was still organizing his gear so it looked like he would win the race. I headed up the 0.2 mile hill back to the trail. 
The rain was steady, but quickly eased up and became a light sprinkle. My plan was just to hike to Cornelius Shelter about 18 miles away. As I was plodding along I saw a little orange critter in the middle of the trail and bent down to have a closer look. It looked like a salamander. It was bright orange and didn’t run away! When it did move, it moved slowly. I texted the picture to my parents and my Dad wrote back that it was an Eastern Newt. Apparently they secrete toxins to protect themselves from being eaten by other things like crayfish. I was not sure if touching them would hurt a person, but I wasn’t going to find out! I wondered if this was why witches’ potions on TV always seemed to have “eye of newt” in them....
I kept hiking and crossed over the Blue  Ridge Parkway and beelined towards a trashcan on the other side. After dumping my trash in it and delighting in lightening my load yet again, I trekked a bit more and came upon Cove Mountain Shelter. Nightmare, Diablo, Finger Food, and Happy Feet were all there. We chatted briefly and then headed out. I took the lead and Happy Feet hung behind me and we talked for a while. It was really nice chatting with her. We talked about our families. She said she has an older sister who will turn 21 soon. I really like hearing about the journeys and backgrounds of the younger hikers. At 19 I wasn’t even thinking about the AT, let alone doing a thru hike! After a bit she slowed down and I kept going at my pace. I saw an interesting bird that had bright yellow wings on a jet black body. It moved too fast to photograph, so when I next have a signal I will have to see if the Google can figure out what it was. I also saw a few little yellowish olive colored birds. They don’t look bright enough or have the same color patterns as goldfinches. I need to figure out what those are too.
The day was full of swollen creek crossings. Two of them were tough and I narrowly missed falling into the first one. I didn’t miss falling into the second, unfortunately. I slipped on the rock I was trying to balance and leap from and plunged my right foot in. So much for drying out! I think it will be end of day Saturday now before I get my socks and shoes dry.
The rain disappeared by afternoon. By late afternoon, I could even see a bit of blue sky! The final climb to the shelter was a long one and felt tough - definitely a sign that I had put in a good day’s worth of walking! I got there at about 5 and saw Zia Fox, as well as two hikers I hadn’t met yet: Fancy Free, a lady from Vermont, and Whitewater, a girl from Canada (Calgary area). Later on Nightmare, Diablo, and Finger Food showed up. Happy Feet and Tarzan did not, but it’s hard to say if they pushed on farther or stopped short. 
I ate my ramen bomb for dinner! I cooked the ramen with some TVP, and then added in garlic mashed potatoes. I actually really liked it, though I dislike cooking food in my pot because then I have to clean it out. Usually with the Knorr rice sides I use my cook pouch to cook them in their bags, and then I just eat them out of the bags. No clean up! For dessert I ate the rest of my peanut butter M&Ms, the rest of my dark chocolate bar, and then I had a tortilla with peanut butter. Of course, I had my usual cup of tea. 
Today was a good day and much drier! The hiking was status who Virginia - nothing momentous, but there were lots of pretty creeks and the wildlife I saw. Nightmare and crew saw a bear about a mile south of camp! I wish I had seen it.... I was grateful for a break in the rain today and to be able to watch the forest critters come out, perhaps also looking for spring. Tomorrow I will either get close to the road crossing to hitch or get a shuttle to Glasgow, or if I’m feeling good I’ll push the 20 miles or so to get there. We shall see! It should be a nice day tomorrow!

#1: Beaker, I plan to try the Gatorade bars. I saw them at Kroger but didn’t get one yet, namely because they are so huge! I’m sure I’ll give them a whirl. As for that McDonalds item, couldn’t they have just called it the McCuddle? I don’t know that I can actually order that sandwich just because I don’t want to say it! What if they don’t know what I’m talking about? Anyway, I never eat mickey D’s normally and so far I haven’t on the trail. Their food doesn’t really appeal to me as much as something like Taco Bell. We’ll see - I’ve learned never to say never! Also, I had no idea there was a secret McDonald’s menu. My wife had to google that for me.

",Cornelius Creek Shelter,"Apr 25, Wed",18.40
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588322,"I woke before the sunrise at about 6. Zia Fox was up getting his food bag down. I got up to pee and do the same. It was a little chillier this morning than the forecast seemed to call for. I retrieved my food bag and noticed another tent behind the shelter. There were three tents when I went to bed and now there were four. Someone must have come into camp really late, but I wasn’t sure who it was. I knew that the original three were Diablo. Finger Food, and Sprinkles (previously Nightmare - she changed it). I bustled about making breakfast and getting my gear together as the shelter came alive. The birds were chorusing nicely, and as light filled the sky I could see that it was indeed going to be a beautiful day! 
There is something about that first full day of sunshine after a period of rain that is really special. Not only does it feel like a gift, but the forest looks, feels, and sounds more vibrant and alive. The greens are brighter - the undergrowth on the forest floor, the moss growing on stones and tree stumps, and the new leaves coming in all radiated a kind of magical aura, as if I were living in an emerald hamlet. There was still a crispness to the morning air, but a slight stickiness was present as well as the morning rays began to lazily evaporate some of the moisture. It smelled earthy and damp; it smelled of new beginnings. The bird songs were full and complex, as if they were all excited to use their talents to the fullest this morning. As I started hiking, I paused here and there to take a few pictures of this scene. It was clear that spring was here. We might still have cold days here and there and it may even snow again, but spring has moved into the neighborhood!
The road crossing for Glasgow was just about 20 miles away, right after the James River Foot Bridge, the longest footbridge on the trail. It is named after William T. Foot, a past thru hiker whose vision and efforts helped to make the bridge a reality. I took a picture of the plaque about this as it has a few more details. There is a shelter about two miles before the bridge, so I figured I would see what time it was and how I felt when I got to that shelter, and if I had enough time I would keep going to the road crossing and hitch into Glasgow.
The first climb took me up to the top of Apple Orchard Mountain. There was a huge weather station tower on top. The trail then dropped back down and passed under a boulder suspended over the trail because it is wedged between two rock formations. This is called “Guillotine.” I ran into Whitewater there and we helped each other take pictures standing under the suspended boulder. I wonder how it got in place, and when! After this, I passed by Thunder Hill Shelter and met a Ridge Runner named Wood Elf. I hadn’t seen a Ridge Runner since the Smokies! We chatted for a bit. He was full of interesting facts and stories. He said he saw that the trillium were starting to bloom, and said something to the effect that trillium take 20 to 50 years to get established before they will start blooming. Wow! So he said when I see trillium blooms, to keep that in mind. This makes me want to do some googling on trillium, but I haven’t had a chance to yet.
I hiked on, continuing down the mountain to a gravel parking lot at a road crossing. This was Petites Gap. It was sunny and had a nice log to sit on, so I decided to have lunch, air out my feet and change my socks. While I was doing this, a guy road up to the lot on his bike and loaded it into his truck. He asked if I was a thru hiker. We chatted a little and he gave me a clementine - I love citrus trail magic! He said he was out collecting morels and asked if I had found any. I had heard about these mushrooms, but told him I really didn’t know how to identify them, etc. He then pulled out a bag of them and walked me through it. They are actually very distinctive looking, and he let me photograph one next to his lighter for scale. He said he finds them just at the edge of forested areas. He chops them up and puts them in omelets for his kids. I want to try this! For the rest of the day I kept my eyes peeled for morels, with no luck. It’s fun to look though! Whitewater arrived as I was getting ready to leave. I slapped on a coat of sunscreen and started the climb to Highcock Knob, where there were some nice views. On the other side of the knob I ran into a hiker who introduced himself as Far Gone. He said that before the next shelter I would have to ford a creek, and not to try to walk on any stones across because they were all submerged. He was pretty dramatic about it, describing how someone had slipped, fallen, and been “swept downstream.” My AWOL guide did say that there was a knee deep creek crossing  to get to Matts Creek Shelter, so presumably that was what this guy meant.  I thanked him and walked on. 
I stopped to  photograph a lizard. It was a little larger than others I had seen, namely in the head, and it had blue belly. I had never seen one like it. I looked it up later and it was an Eastern Fence Lizard. Then, I saw a southbound hiker approaching. He was hiking shirtless with a large backpack in short shorts. He had multiple tattoos, including colored facial tattoos. He was tall with a big barrel chest. As he approached I could see something in his mouth. At first I thought he was drinking from a camel pack. Nope. Not a camel pack.... It was a PACIFIER! Yep. A pacifier. I said hello as he approached and he stopped, looking frustrated. He then pulled the pacifier out of his mouth and asked me how far the Blue Ridge Parkway was. I told him it was a ways back and to head to Thunder Hill Shelter. He replaced the pacifier and marched on. Huh! The trail just gets more and more interesting!
I got down to Matts Creek Shelter and, sure enough, there was a creek that had to be forded, not just to get to the shelter but to continue the trail. It was extra high with all the rain, so I walked upstream to a safer looking spot, swapped my shoes out for my crocs, and crossed over. The cold water felt great on my feet! It was no big deal and I scrambled up the bank on the other side. As I walked back to the trail and shelter, I almost stepped on a large black snake! It was about three feet long and was not really interested in running away from me. I circled around it and went to the shelter picnic table. There were a pair of flip flop thru hikers at the shelter and I talked with them as I dried my feet and put my shoes back on. Whitewater arrived, so I showed her where I had crossed and waited for her to come across so I could point out the snake. So many cool reptiles today! I left them all chatting at the shelter and pushed on. It was only about 4:30 and I could be at the road crossing shortly after 5. 
I hiked along the creek down to the James River, which is quite wide. There were some pretty cliffside waterfalls on the walk by the river. I couldn’t tell if they were always there, or just a result of all of the rain. I got to the Foot Bridge, took some photos and walked across. It was pretty cool and offered views of the river, which was brown from all of the rain. The bridge ends at the road crossing parking lot. I walked up and crossed the street since I was heading west. It only took me a few minutes and I had a ride! He was an older gentleman named Tony Ware. He said that he and his wife regularly pick up hikers on their drives through town. They also sometimes grill out in that parking lot for hikers as we roll through. He was the nicest guy and told me about the facilities in Glasgow. It’s about 5-6 miles into town from the trail, and he dropped me off right at the Glasgow Shelter! I thanked him profusely and walked around to check out the digs.
Let me start by saying that the Glasgow Shelter is free.... Glasgow is a very small town: no traffic lights, two T intersections that I saw, one restaurant called Scottos, a mini mart grocery, Dollar General, post office, library and gas station. The town provides the shelter for free, and apparently it was an Eagle Scout project originally. The shelter, however, needed a bit of TLC. It was pretty trashed with food left out everywhere and trash. With it being right there at the edge of town, I felt a little like I was standing in some kind of serial killer’s lair! I was the only one there, which I think made it worse. Oh well - I was going to do this, so may as well get started. It had bunks built out of wood, so I threw my pack by one and went to check out the shower. It was an outdoor shower, but did, in fact, have warm water! This was good. I decided I would shower, then go to Scottos to eat, and then see if any other hikers, or if unsavory characters showed up at the shelter. There was one catch though - I didn’t have a towel. I could have patted down with my buff, but I was tired of my gear being wet. There were a few towels laying around, and most of them looked like they had been used to clean up truck stop bathroom floors and never washed. There was a peach-colored one draped over a lawn chair that looked tolerable. I went over, picked it up and smelled it. It was soft, not stiff, and it didn’t smell horrible. I decided to go for it. I know this is super disgusting, but keep in mind I hadn’t had a shower for a week. I was filthy.... The shower worked fine and someone had even left shampoo, so I used that and my camp soap to wash. I realized how badly I needed a deeper cleaning to work on the dirt around my nails. I would take care of that at my next town stop. I got myself as clean as I could, changed into slightly better smelling clothes, and took my pack up to Scottos to eat. 
I saw Tarzan and Remmy in Scottos - they had just finished up and were going to the shelter after running a few errands. I sat down in “the hiker room” (e.g. a room that smells like B.O. because they quadron us all off there to keep our scent from offending other patrons) and ordered an Italian sausage ziti dinner. This came with garlic bread and a salad. Yum! I had pink lemonade with that, and then had coffee and a milkshake. I decided that I would resupply after dinner, so I made a quick run back to the shelter with my stuff. Remmy was there and said “this is gross, I’m going to tent in the field!” I laughed and strongly considered doing the same, but it was going to rain overnight and I didn’t want to deal with a soggy tent. I turned on an shadeless Eiffel Tower lamp that was at the shelter so I could see. They actually had electrical outlets that we could use, which was a plus. I ran over to Dollar General and knocked out my resupply. When I came back Bama Dog had arrived. Good - there is safety in numbers! In the end, it was me, Tarzan and Bama Dog in the Shelter. I cleaned up as best I could. I took all the food that was left around and threw it in the trash cans behind the shelter. All of those were over flowing, so I could only imagine the party of opossums, rats and raccoons that might visit later. I took a look in the porta potty. The service schedule indicated no service since 2015. Hmmm..... 
Despite these things, we were all still grateful to have some kind of shelter. It was very convenient and it was also free. I was super grateful for an awesome day of hiking, an interesting day of sights, and a break from the rain! So far the people of Glasgow had been good to us, so we made the best of it, had fun joking around while we organized our resupply, and then went to sleep. I wore my bug net to keep bugs off my face. I thought maybe it might also confuse any deranged nighttime murderers.","Cornelius Creek Shelter
",Glasgow Shelter (US 501 at mile 786),"Apr 26, Thu",19.90
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588470,"The sound of rain entered my consciousness as I slowly woke. More rain??? It had rained all night and was still lightly falling. I was happy to be in the shelter, nice and dry. I was also happy we didn’t have any issues with rats or raccoons, or murderers! I got up and got my food bag out of a tree. Tarzan and Bama Dog stirred awake. I worked on packing up my things, then decided to walk to the gas station to see if they had any food. The rain had now transformed to a light mist.
I walked across the meadow between the shelter and the road, dusting the tips of my shoes with bright green freshly mowed grass tips. The gas station attendant was standing outside watching the two street T intersection in front of the station, smoking a cigarette. Glasgow is a tiny town. Calling it a town is really a bit of a misnomer in the sense that it might conjure images of a row of shops, or a neighborhood of houses strung together. That’s not Glasgow. Behind the gas station, however, there was a baseball diamond. The gas station had the usual snacks and drinks, but they also had Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches and a microwave, so I grabbed a sandwich. I also got a Krispy Kreme jumbo iced honey bun. I’m pretty sure that is the sugar equivalent of putting hot sauce on your hot sauce. I went to the register and asked the lady if she had an hot coffee. She said “it’s right there in front of your face son,” pointing to where I had just been standing by the breakfast sandwiches. So it was! I guess my night’s rest at the Jack the Ripper motel hadn’t been as good as I thought. I poured a coffee and added some packet creamer, then paid for my things. “One minute” the lady said, holding up a single finger. I realized she meant the time to microwave the sandwich. I felt a little like a cadet at boot camp who was not impressing the drill sergeant. Bama Dog walked in as I moved to the microwave. I pointed out the sandwiches and heated mine for one minute. She was right! I stood there and wolfed it down, wishing I had gotten another but unwilling to go back to the counter. Bama Dog had gotten a different kind of sandwich and his were in a plastic wrapper. He fiddled with them and said he wasn’t sure whether to microwave them in the wrapper or not. I looked around for a paper towel, but there were none. Seeing the confusion, the attendant decided to go outside and have a cigarette, but on the way out she said “one minute” as she walked by. I decided to leave and let Bama Dog work it out. 
Back at the shelter, Wallace, Sprinkles (formerly Nightmare), Diablo and Finger Food had arrived. Wallace was going to zero at the shelter. He’d stayed at Stanimal’s hostel there, but apparently the person running it for Stanimal (he runs the Waynesboro location) was putting off bad vibes, so he decided to switch to the free option. The others had just arrived. We joked around and lamented a bit as the rain started falling again. Finger Food stared solemnly at the rain, seemingly searching deep within for a reason to go on. We were all expecting a clear day and I think all surprised that it was raining with no real end in sight. I decided to run across to the grocery express and grab another iced honey bun and a Monster energy drink. If I was going to hitch out of Glasgow in the rain, I might as well be jacked on sugar and caffeine while doing it. 
When I got back and finished my snack, Tarzan was no where to be found, and Remmy was still in his tent. Bama Dog had to resupply and the rest were staying, so I decided to head out alone. It was now just barely misting again. I walked up the road past the gas station and kept going. Yesterday Tony had advised me to hitch “at the intersection,” and when I asked which intersection he said “you’ll know what I mean.” Now understanding that he meant the only intersection of any consequence, I walked that way. As I walked I turned back and saw a small car coming. Not a likely hitch - usually trucks and SUVs pick us up because they have room for us and gear. But wait! This car seemed to be responding to my thumb! The driver pulled over in a car that was slightly smaller than my wife’s Prius. He was a young guy named Stefan and offered me a ride to the trail head. He moved around some computer equipment in the backseat and off we went. He said he had been a diving instructor living in Fiji with his girlfriend, but wasn’t making any money so he came back to help his father with an internet service provider business he had established locally. We talked a bit about traveling. He was super nice and I think his adventurous lifestyle had afforded him an appreciation for things like a thru hike. As I got out of the car, I wished him well in his ventures. 
Back at the James River Foot Bridge, I hit the trail just as the sky was starting to clear. This was a good sign! I filtered water at the first stream I came to and then started climbing. Leaving a town inevitably means going up. I climbed Little Rocky Row and then to Big Rocky Row. The views over the James River Valley were stunning. I passed Happy Feet taking a break. Apparently, she had gone into and out of Glasgow like a ninja this morning just to resupply. I walked on and climbed up Bluff Mountain. Right near the top was a marker that indicated “the exact spot” where little Ottie Cline Powell, a 4 year old, had been found dead after wandering off in 1891. The way the marker phrased it gave me the creeps, but I still decided to hang out on the top of the mountain to have a Snickers. The views were good and, hey, everybody knows that Snickers have natural boogeyman repelling properties. Happy Feet arrived and broke out a snack as well. She agreed the sign was creepy. I told her I was going to press on, but to enjoy her salsa tortillas with Ottie Cline. She looked a little freaked out as I left. 
I hiked past Punchbowl Shelter, presumably so named because of the pond nearby. I crossed the Pedlar Bridge across a river and it was getting into the evening hours, so I decided to look for a place to camp. As luck would have it (or as the trail would provide), I found a nice little two-seater camp spot complete with a fire ring and a little pile of wood. Perfect! I set up camp and then spent about 30 minutes just looking for a proper branch to hang my food bag. I couldn’t find anything!!! It was like the trees had no arms. I finally settled on one that was really too low, but would probably do unless Kareem Abdul the Bear came to camp. I could jump and touch the bag, and I’m a whopping 5’ 8” with shoes on.... I settled down to make dinner and made a small fire at the same time. This was my first fire on the trail! I’d say by others, but this was the first I’d made myself. It was really quite lovely. I half hoped Happy Feet or someone else might walk by late looking for a spot to drop so that I could offer the guest room next to my glorious fire (the fire pit was between my spot and the other vacant tenting spot). No one came, but I was also quite content to just be by myself in the woods. The moon was bright - nearly full. I didn’t need my headlamp. I was grateful that the weather had improved and for all of the beautiful views that nature had offered me today. I was grateful for the warmth of the fire and the calming solace of the wilderness. I would rest well.

#1 - Kate-  In terms of running, yes I was running regularly before starting my hike, but I was actually tapering that off. I was a regular runner for years. I had run two marathons and have a pretty good pace - I run about an 8 minute mile for a marathon. That said, when I started to decide I might just do the trail, I didn’t want to hurt myself so I tapered back the running a bit just in case. I don’t remember exactly the regular distances I was running, but I would run 5-6 days a week and I was probably running 5-6 miles and maybe a 9 miler in the weekends. I cut that back to 4 mile runs and started using the stair climber at my local gym to train for the trail. I would put my weighted pack on. I think this was much better training than running for the physical strain. Running, however, was great cardio training. I don’t really huff and puff much going up hills as a result. Honestly, in hindsight, the best training would have been to simply strap my pack on and get out and hike, but driving out of Atlanta is a serious mental (traffic) and time commitment, so the gym worked well for me, as did running outside. No training will fully prep for the difficulty of real thru hiking, but I have never felt like I am out of my league physically when it has come to the challenges of the trail. For me, the real physical challenge is just making sure I listen to my body. Something always hurts - I just have to make sure I take the time to rest. That is incredibly hard for me! I always want to keep pushing on. 
#2 - forgot to mention Glasgow actually had a giant fiberglass (or something) dinosaur by the side of the road. Weird! I have no idea why. I took a picture, but it was getting dark....

",Stealth Campsite at mile 801.5,"Apr 27, Fri",15.50
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588605,"There was a chilly crispness to the air when I woke. I donned my rain jacket as I went to get my food bag down and get some water boiling for coffee. Fortunately for me, either no bears or only really short ones were around last night because my food bag was still hanging, unperturbed. I thought about a bear standing on its hind legs and jumping up and down and not being able to get to my bag. Somehow, in my head that image made me laugh. I packed up my tent while drinking my coffee, inhaled two oatmeal packets and some pop tarts, and got ready to roll. I double checked to make sure my campfire spot was completely saturated with water and then headed north. 
The morning hike took me around the banks of the Lynchburg reservoir and then down through the forest to Brown Mountain Creek. There was a little bit of a trail re-route here. The trail normally runs right beside the creek, but for the first section I walked on a parallel forest road. The reroute was recent. Storms had caused a tree to fall directly onto a bridge over the creek, essentially crushing it to smithereens. Fortunately, it was a short section and we were still able to cross the creek in time to see the plaques along a section of the creek that talk about the community that once lived there. I took pictures of these plaques and put them in my gallery. Some structure foundations made of stone and an old stone wall are still visible along the creek. The stream itself was really gorgeous; I wondered if there were any trout in it. The Brown Mountain Creek Shelter has a really nice view of the water. I stopped there to sign the shelter log, and then walked on.
It was quite hot out, at least it felt that way to me. The sun was beating down on me and I knew I needed to get some sunscreen on. I walked up to the Highway 60 road crossing and saw a picnic table on the other side of the road. It seemed like a great place to take a break and also dry out my tent tarp (condensation from last night). As I went around the corner some hikers heading south told me there was trail magic. I got very excited, and around the bend, there he was with all of his glory! The gentleman’s name was Ken Hawkins. He had a love for hiking himself and this June will complete his final section of the AT! He had a whole table set up with ingredients to make sandwiches, butterscotch oatmeal cookies that his wife had baked, Little Debbie’s of various kinds, chocolate, apples, clementines, potato chips, and sodas. Pure heaven! I had an apple, clementine, peanut butter and Nutella sandwich, some cheese puffs, some of the homemade cookies, and a Dr. Pepper. My favorite were the homemade cookies! I dried out my gear and chatted with Ken for quite a while. I was probably there for 40 minutes. Ken was a super nice guy. He said that after the AT he might try the Florida Trail. He had looked into the Palmetto Trail in South Carolina, but heard that it was not well marked and very hard to follow in some places. I thanked Ken profusely for the food and wished him luck on finishing his final AT section. 
The climb out of highway 60 was anything but easy. The sun was beating down on my full belly and me. I took it slowly. I climbed up to Bald Knob and, at one point took a break to eat some trail crepes and try to pursue an elusive mobile signal, which didn’t pan out well. Trail crepes are what I call my tortillas with Nutella. After the knob the trail went up Cole Mountain, which had some nice views across a grassy expanse. I was so close to being a. 4000 feet again on Cole Mountain - just shy of it. The trail dropped down to 3500 feet at Hog Camp Gap and then climbed back up to Tar Jacket Ridge for more pretty views.
At this point I was pretty tired just from the heat alone, but also from the ups and downs. I made it through one more Gap and one more climb and ended up deciding to tent about a mile south of the Piney River on a ridge line at approximately 3600 feet. My feet had gone far enough and I just wanted to be done for the day. My spot was quite pretty! I climbed up over some boulders for a view, where a crisp wind caused me to quickly head back down. I made my dinner as the wind picked up a bit, hung my food bag and even pre-dug a cat hole for the morning! I could feel the temperature dropping. I expected it to get to just above freezing. What I didn’t count on was the wind. I went to bed to the sound of the wind picking up. Ok, so maybe a little wind was in order. How bad could it be? I was quite tired and could stay awake to find out. I fell asleep, grateful for the wonderful clear views today and for Ken’s amazing trail magic and spirit. It was a good day!","Stealth Campsite at mile 801.5

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588790,"How bad could the wind be I had wondered just before dozing off.... I woke at about a quarter to two in the morning and it was howling and pummeling my poor tent. My campsite had turned into a ridge line turbine wind tunnel, and I was fairly sure I was going to die, or my tent would break, but probably both! I had my head by the vestibule of my tent. Looking down at my feet, the wind was blowing the  left side of my tent so hard that the central tent pole was bending down to my knees. The top of my tent was repeatedly being blown down and sidewise such that it would get close to my knees if I bent my legs! On top of that, the temperature was dropping to around freezing and the wind added an extra bite to the air. It wasn’t like the wind would gust for a bit and then stop, then gust again - it was relentless! I lay there for a few minutes just watching and observing it. I knew it wasn’t good. I also thought about the trees around me. What if one blew over and turned me into a human pancake? This thought made me hungry.... I knew there was one dead tree nearby. I had pushed on it before setting up camp there and it still seemed solid, but trees collapse all the time. I considered the option of leaving, but standing up outside in this freezing wind in the dark just sounded like a bad idea, not to mention the potential for gear to blow away and get lost in the dark. I actually had a cell signal at camp (another selling point for me on the spot). I sat there and googled Big Agnes tents to see if there were an my wind ratings for mine. Yeah, I actually did this. I came up with nothing. Why didn’t I fasten the upper two guy lines on my tent tarp?! Because I never do, that’s why, because usually I don’t set up my tent behind a jet airplane turbine. I could see myself, like Billy Bob Thornton in  the movie Pushing Tin, being blown backwards like a tumbleweed off the mountain. I decided I would hunker down and stick it out. My tent hadn’t broken yet.... My next challenge though was that I had to pee. Ugh! I didn’t want to go outside! I probably should have gone outside, but I had this irrational fear that something bad would happen - that the tent would blow away without my body weight, or that I would get blown over. I mean, they were probably only 40mph winds, so neither of these things was likely to happen. It was the middle of the night though, and so that’s what ran through my mind. I then had an idea: I would just utilize the vestibule area! I had heard of other hikers doing this. I can’t exactly kneel in my tent because the ceiling is not high enough. So instead, I kind of scrunched a little sideways and worked my way to the edge. As I’m doing this, the wind continues to howl defiantly. I reached the point of no return and started to pee. This was not doing to be a small delivery - I really had to go! It only took two seconds for me to realize that this was going to go horribly wrong. I should probably never be an engineer. I had failed to notice the slope of the land within my vestibule; it all slopes back towards my tent. All I could do was semi lay, semi propped, watching my pee flow backwards between my tent and my tarp. Awesome.... When it was over, I crawled back in and zipped up, defeated. I had made my bed, peed under it, and now I would love with it. I went back to sleep. Maybe a tree would fall and crush me to avoid me waking up to my secret shame.
No dice. I woke again at 3:30, and again at some only-the-dead-should-be-awake hour, and then again at 6. At 6, enough was enough - time to evacuate! I checked the vestibule and saw the damp spot under my tent and on my tarp. Great memories there.... I took a wet wipe and tried to reach my hand out and under the tent to wipe it a bit. It was less than effective, but mentally made me feel better. I kept telling myself, “urine is sterile,” but I kept thinking about this rug we once had that the cats had soaked with their pee. I was going to live the rest of my trip in my cat pee tent. My Hungry Cat pee tent!! I organized my stuff into my bag and put on most of my clothing, including puffy and rain gear, to deal with the biting wind and cold. I exited my tent and yanked my pack out after me. Huh.... the wind didn’t seem SO bad once I was out. It had also definitely calmed down a little bit, albeit my tent was shaking and shifting around. I carefully disassembled it, almost losing the rain fly to a large gust of wind. When I pulled the tent off the ground cover tarp footprint, I noticed that my pee was frozen to it. Awesome! I could enjoy that again later when it thawed. I stuffed the violated items in the outside mesh pocket of my pack. Lastly, I had to get my food bag down, which was miraculously hanging from its branch still, albeit it was swaying somewhat violently. I ran out of camp with stuff sticking out of my pack in weird ways, like a burglar caught mid job.
As I hiked out, I saw the group of weekend campers I had met before. Their spot was pretty windy too. I wondered how they had  faired last night. I hiked furiously to get down to a lower altitude. I arrived at the north fork of the Piney River to a spot that was not only not windy, but had a twinkling of sunshine through the trees, some beautiful large boulders, and a few lovely, flat, tenting spots near a fire ring. Had I walked one more mile last night, I could have camped here. When I say the trail provides though, it doesn’t mean I always get what I want. As The Rolling Stones song goes, “you can’t always get what you want, but you’ll find sometimes, you get what you need.” “The trail will provide” means I will get what I need, even if it is not apparent to me at the time. Maybe I needed a swift kick in the butt, lest I get overconfident with my hiking. Maybe I needed that lesson on altitude ridge camping and wind. Maybe I needed to learn to pee outside of the tent or suck it up and use a Gatorade bottle. It’s not for me to question or to try and understand. It just is. Shortly after Piney Fork I stripped down to my shorts and t shirt and just left my rain jacket on. I decided I would hike to The Priest Shelter (in The Priest Wilderness) and have my morning coffee and a snack there.  
I was a little beaten down hiking to The Priest. There are so many parallels between this journey and my nine years of Catholic school and visiting the confessional. But I don’t have time to go there in detail now. Let’s just say that I was tired and feeling a bit shameful for violating my tent. There must be jokes about this. “You know urine the woods too long when urine your tent and your urine....” So I walked towards The Priest hoping for some sun to dry things out and some relief. One of my favorite woodland creatures that I see all the time, all over the trail, is the chipmunk. It reminds me of my cat Lucy. They are reddish like Lucy, very shy and love to eat! That’s Lucy! Usually when chipmunks see me, they just run for their hidey holes. For the first time this morning, a chipmunk let out a tiny, but very audible, scream as it ran away from me. It SCREAMED! Of course my slightly downtrodden self told myself that it was because I was so gross, etc. I terrified the poor chipmunk. He probably has chipmunk PTSD now. 
I got to The Priest Shelter and there was a weekend hiker there. I spread my tent and tarp out to dry. It conveniently already smelled like pee by the picnic table, so that made me feel better. Honestly, I don’t think my tent smelled, but it was good to have a mask just in case. I chatted with a weekend hiker there for a while while I filtered water and made coffee and trail crepes (tortillas with Nutella). I felt better after having a snack, drying out my gear, and chatting with her. I realized that in my haste to get to The Priest I had passed by the Spy Rock overlook, which is supposed to be good. Oh well. The rest of the day would treat me to good views! 
I hiked on and started the climb up to The Priest. I briefly met two thru hikers, Bones and Garfield. They were equally glad to be done with the wind and we talked a little about the night before. They also asked if I had seen the pacifier guy. He’s been the talk of the trail!! I decided in my head to give him a trail name. I love the idea that we all get to hike our own hike. So what if he wants to hike with a pacifier? Kudos to him for being brave and doing what he wanted to do! I feel like we need to support that, and therefore I feel like he deserves a trail name. In my head, it could be Binkie, but that might not sit well so I think it could be Pac-Man. Pac for pacifier, but also he had a really determined walk, kind of like Pac-Man gobbling up ghosts. Pac-Man, if you’re out there, good for you for owning your hike! You’re trail famous!
Anyway, the views at The Priest were great and from there I headed downhill to the Tye River suspension bridge. After that it was an uphill climb for the rest of the day. It was tough, but I hiked all the way to Maupin Field Shelter. I climbed past Chimney Rock up to the peak of Three Ridges mountain. The views along the way and at the top were amazing! There was a cool overlook called Hanging Rock and I enjoyed the panorama there as well. I got to Maupin at 7pm. There were a lot of tents and one guy in the shelter, but everyone who was in a tent did not emerge, presumably as exhausted as I was. I was efficient about setting up camp and cooking and fell asleep by 9:30. 
Today I was so grateful to be out of the wind, warm, and at a tent site that was not on a ridge! I was thankful for the views and such awesome hiking today, as well as for the strength to get to Maupin safely.  It was a good day, and my pee tent was comfortable and odor free! Home sweet home....","Stealth Campsite at mile 819
",Maupin Field Shelter,"Apr 29, Sun",23.20
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588839,"I got up early at Maupin, but namely so I could catch up on my journaling a bit. I’ve been getting behind. I take some notes during the day, but usually I have to squeeze in the writing at night. I’ve been so tired lately from the miles and heat that  I can barely stay awake at night to get a few sentences down. Sometimes I try the morning journaling, but I’m also usually antsy for breakfast and to get out and hike. Today I decided to eat breakfast, then journal while I had my coffee. I slept well last night. The weather was chilly but not freezing, and I was so tired from the events of the night before, not to mention hiking 20+ miles. I ran and grabbed my food bag off the bear pole. A bear pole is basically a giant coat hanger for food bags. It is somewhere in the 15-20 feet range and has hooked arms at the top. There is a long metal hook rod that looks a little like a shuffleboard stick, and you use that to hang your food bag on the hook. I like the bear pole! It saves me from having to use my bear line.
By the time I left camp at 9:30, everyone else was gone. I filtered some water at the pretty little stream behind the shelter and headed out. I immediately ran into a couple from somewhere overseas (I think Germany but I’m not sure). They were out for the day walking the Mau-Har trail, a loop trail that goes from just north of Maupin Shelter back to the AT south near the previous shelter. It’s supposed to be a really beautiful loop trail and I know some thrus who took it, but I’m a white blazer so I’ll have to come back for that one. They asked me a few directions and i helped them out using Guthook, and then I took off.
The day was easy hiking. Some ups and downs but no momentous climbs or anything. I didn’t see a single thru hiker during the day, and only passed a few day or section hikers. It was a good day just to enjoy the warm weather - sweating is much better than freezing!! There were some nice views, and I enjoyed watching the chipmunks, squirrels and towhees foraging around in thickets. I had lunch at an awesome overlook, and I also took a side trail to see Humpback Rocks - a rock formation that looks a little like a humpback whale. I did pass Radio today, who was heading southbound. As a refresher, Captain Krispy had a friend join him for part of his hike. He left the trail and then came back on his own to do a section, this time walking South. I almost didn’t recognize him because he had cut his hair and shaved his beard! We chatted for a bit about Krispy’s injury and he said that Krispy will just finish his hike next summer. Bummer! I was hoping maybe he would heal fast and somehow make it back, but I guess a stress fractured femur is serious and needs time to heal.
I trekked on and came to a cooler of trail magic near a parking area. Alas, the sodas inside were all empty! I spent some time singing songs again today. Perhaps related to my ridge line camping experience the other night, I sang a few rounds of “Bend and Break” by Keane. That then lead me into another of their songs, “Somewhere Only We Know.” It’s such a good song for me on the trail, wanting to get back in touch with simple things myself. The song’s refrain goes: “oh simple thing, where have you gone? I’m getting tired and I need something to rely on. So tell me when, you’re gonna let me in. I’m getting tired and I need somewhere to begin.” It’s so easy to get tired and sucked into the meaningless business of things that don’t really matter. The trail is a great reminder of things that truly matter, even if they are not on the trail! I think even truly lost people can feel it. It’s like coming home, or knowing you’re close to home. The first verse of that song is an interesting parallel, because he sings: “I walked across an empty land. I knew the pathway like the back of my hand. I felt the earth beneath my feet. Sat by a river it did make me complete.” He sings that even as he asks where that simple connection has gone. I think the message is that the simple things have always been there - we just can’t lose them. We can’t let them go, which means we have to remain open to the way they have always made us feel, even if that seems silly as we grow older. It’s not just appreciating the simple things; it’s holding on to the connection we feel with them and protecting that pathway. And by all those “we’s” I guess I mean “me,” since this is a diary of my thoughts and experiences and not a projection on other people. 
Whitewater and a section hiker were at Paul Wolfe when I arrived. The shelter was awesome, with a huge covered sitting area with a picnic table, double decker platforms and even skylights on the side. The creek in front of the shelter was quite pretty and made for a lovely water source. Tarzan showed up and we all made food and chatted. We had a funny conversation about favorite M&Ms. Whitewater loves the caramel ones, so I’ll have to give those a whirl. I have never had them. When I said I liked peanut butter M&Ms, the section hiker claimed they weren’t M&Ms because there was no chocolate, and the debate was on! It was light hearted and funny. 
I was only 5 miles away from Waynesboro. Originally, I thought I would just hike in the same day, but I have a lot of things to accomplish in town, so I figured it was better to arrive early in the morning. I am considering a zero in town, but not sure yet. I need to stay somewhere and shower, do laundry, resupply, get a new gas canister, bug spray and permethrin, retreat my clothes, and EAT! I have my food eyes on Ming’s all you can eat Chinese buffet and a diner called Weasies. I was grateful today for the good weather and relatively straightforward hiking, as well as having some camaraderie at camp. Lucky for me, I don’t have to wonder where the simple thing is. It’s all around me every day.Postscripts:#1 - yesterday was my Dad’s birthday and I forgot to mention that I was able to get a signal and call him. That was nice and I talked with both parents for a bit, mid trail! Happy birthday Dad!!#2 - I forgot to mention how funny the shelter logbook is at The Priest Shelter. Most hikers start their entry with “Forgive me father for I have sinned” and then confess something.i did not, but I wish I had confessed about my tent incident!","Maupin Field Shelter
",Paul Wolfe Shelter,"Apr 30, Mon",15.80
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588850,"I woke at the shelter right at 6. I figured it would take me 2 hrs to hike the 5 miles to Rockfish Gap. Around 10:30 last night someone had come into the shelter and settled in upstairs. I didn’t know who it was though. I got up quietly and got my food bag. I was organizing my gear when suddenly I heard a forced whisper behind me. “Hungry Cat is that you? Did you lose a spork?” It was Zia Fox. Tarzan had thought he was staying behind because of a hurt foot, but apparently he had gotten a second wind. I suppose last night was a good night to hike - I believe it was a full moon, or close to it. The moon was very bright. I had not lost a spork, but apparently someone had and Zia had picked it up.
I didn’t eat breakfast or even brush my teeth; I booked it for town! I wanted to get breakfast in town as well. The hike out was interesting. I saw three whitetail deer and a wild turkey. The turkey kept walking on the trail in front of me. It would see me coming and hurry down the trail rather than get off the trail. It was pretty amusing. I also passed by an old family cemetery with very old and handmade looking unmarked gravestones in it, and an old chimney and house foundation made of stone. The graveyard reminded me a bit of that Jodie Foster movie “Nell.” I could definitely picture her burying poor chickapea here.... 
I arrived at Rockfish Gap and before I even got to the parking lot a truck pulled up next to me on the road. A gentleman rolled down the window and asked I I was going into town. He said he was one of the trail angels and would give me a lift. Awesome! I threw my pack in the truck bed and hopped in. His name was John Lowdermilk, and he was quite an interesting fellow. He was local to the area, although he had lived in Long Beach, CA for years running his own transmission shops. He drove me to Stanimals 328 Hostel, where I would stay that night, and pointed out some of the town points of interest for hikers: the Rockfish Gap Outfitters, Ming’s, a few other eateries, etc. He also pointed out the town theatre, which he said he was working on helping to restore to production. Like all of the trail angels, John was just a really nice, generous person and very interesting to talk with. I was incredibly appreciative of the ride and felt very welcomed to Waynesboro! 
My first impression of Waynesboro was that it was a fairly large town. As a result, I noticed traffic moving faster. Atlanta will really be a culture shock when I get back / traffic there is ridiculous! Waynesboro also had a lot of conveniences, like many places to eat and shop and resupply. I saw Sharkbait leaving Stanimals and he kindly gave me a bag of turkey jerky that he didn’t need. Stanimal (the hostel owner’s trail name) wasn’t there so I called him and got sorted, then ran out the door to breakfast. I went to a place called Weasies. It was just under a mile away and delicious. It was a local diner and I had the Hungry Boy breakfast, which was 3 blueberry pancakes, 2 eggs, bacon, and home fries. They didn’t have a Hungry Cat breakfast!  After I ate that with coffee, I had blackberry cobbler with whipped cream. The diner was hopping, mostly with an older retired crowd given it was Monday. 
After breakfast I went up to The outfitter. I walked so I could digest my food. It was about a mile I think. I acquired the bug spray and gas canister I needed, but they were out of permethrin. I decided I would go out to Walmart for that. I went outside to try and hitch a ride back into town. After a few minutes of failed attempts, a guy approached me from the store and asked where I was going. He was another thru hiker named Luke Dog working on a flip flop and he and another hiker (SAS - Slow and Steady) had called an Uber to get to the post office. I never even thought about uber - good idea! They offered to let me hop in with them as they were going to the post office in town, so I did. Thanks guys!!!! Once there I  walked over to the Walmart Neighborhood Market store, but they didn’t have permethrin. I then got a ride out to the Walmart super center 2 miles away and took care of my entire resupply there. They had everything I needed, including permethrin! I got a ride back to the hostel, and saw that Happy Feet, Tarzan, Zia, and Whitewater were all there! I had though they were all staying at the YMCA where you can tent for free. Apparently they all decided Stanimals was more convenient, and it really was! The room included laundry and shuttling to and from the trail. 
My next task was laundry. The hostel had loaner clothes, so I picked some out and out all of my filthy stuff in the wash. While that was getting clean, I spread my gear out back - pack, tent, footprint, shoes, gaiters, and applied a permethrin treatment and left it to dry. I went back inside and organized my resupply food, breaking it down by day. I flipped my laundry over to dry after that, and then cleaned up some of my camp kitchen gear that really needed a good wash, as well as my dirty water collection reservoir bag. I back flushed my Sawyer filter as well. When that was done I set about a windscreen making project using an empty aluminum can. I was trying to make a windscreen that I had seen another hiker with on the trail. I gave it my best effort! I’ll find out next time I boil water if it works!
Once my clothes were dry I took them out back and applied a permethrin treatment. Beware ticks, beware!! Then I finally I saw Zia with an ice cream from a place just a few doors down from the hostel called Kline’s. They make ice cream there and had all sorts of flavors and varieties. I ended up getting an Oreo sundae with chocolate sauce, whipped cream, and cookie dough chunks. I took that back to the hostel and demolished it, then finally showered. That shower felt amazing! I was so dirty that it took me a while. I cleaned under my nails and in all the cracks and crevices. I looked in the mirror - my beard is really getting out of control! It’s pretty “puffy“ now. 
I was pretty tired after all those chores, but I felt good and organized. My one last task was to eat again, so I tried to round up some hikers to go to Ming’s. Whitewater went with me and we had an awesome time destroying the buffet there and chatting about this and that. It was cool to learn more about her aspirations for grad school in English lit. I also got to speak Chinese with the waitress there, which was fun. Having lived in China and eaten lots of authentic Chinese food, I can confirm that Ming’s is definitely “Americanized” and not the place you go if you want an authentic Chinese food experience. However, for a hiker meal or just for any old hungry cat out there, Ming’s is great and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal! I was glad I went, though I kind of wish I had taken some pictures there too. I don’t even remember how many plates of food I had.... They had sushi as part of the buffet as well! 
After all that it was time for bed. Whitewater and I stopped at the Walmart on the way home for a few more things. I was exhausted and tried to catch up on my journal, but just fell asleep. I decided I would not zero in Waynesboro. The weather was good and I had done what I needed to do here. Time to get into the Shenandoahs!
I fell asleep grateful for such a welcoming town, a good hostel to sleep at, and hiker friends. Oh, and Weasies and Kline’s and Ming’s :-). I was very grateful to be able to work through my punch list of things to do today. Tomorrow I could just eat and hike!","Paul Wolfe Shelter

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588851,"I had an amazing sleep in my bed at Stanimals! When I woke up, I went downstairs and had first breakfast with Whitewater and Zia. I had a banana and a smoothie fruit drink, and Whitewater had offered up fruit loops as she had a whole box she couldn’t finish, so I had four bowls of fruit loops. We made coffee at the hostel and I drank about 5 cups while journaling upstairs, desperately trying to catch up. I took another shower (oh luxury!), then got my pack ready to go. Tarzan had expressed interest in going to Weasies and Stanimal was kind enough to drop us off there on his way out. I had the hungry boy again, but this time with sausage links, and instead of regular syrup I had blueberry syrup on my blueberry pancakes. I actually skipped more coffee as I was so jacked up from the pot at the hostel. Tarzan and I had a good time chit chatting. The diner was hopping again! As we exited, a man who had been standing outside on the phone asked if I was a thru hiker. I said yes and then he asked if I was Hungry Cat. I said yes again. Apparently he had been down at the outfitter where Happy Feet was and asked her if she knew me. She had told him I was at the diner. His name was Jim (I believe he said his last name was Leake - sorry Jim if I got that wrong!) and he said he was reading my journal. He said a friend of his, David Sopes, had offered to take me out to dinner in Waynesboro a while back. That jogged my memory and I did remember David’s post in my guest book. Sorry David that I missed you! This town visit was particularly full of hiker chores. I do appreciate your kindness though! Don’t worry - I would have made you proud at Ming’s! 
Jim was really nice and offered to give us a ride back to the hostel. We hopped in his car and chatted. It always surprises me when I meet people who are actually reading this, and it surprises me even more that a few people actually even enjoy it! It’s kind of cool. Thanks Jim for the ride and it was really nice meeting you! It probably would have been a lot easier for folks to track me down if I had been able to get current on my journal. 
After we got back to the hostel I had to explain to Tarzan about the journal, etc., so I did. We then got ready to hit the trail with Whitewater. Stanimal came back and shuttled us up to Rockfish Gap as we said goodbye to Waynesboro. Part of me wanted to stay another day to eat and hang out, and maybe while away some time at a coffee shop I saw (but did not go to) called French Press. The Shenandoahs were calling though, and I only planned to hike to the first shelter so it would be an easy day.
When we got to the trailhead, Happy Feet showed up in John Lowdermilk’s truck with a new pack! I said hi to John, and then the four of us hit the trail. The day was super hot, roughly 85 degrees, and we got off trail at one point and had to double back, but the hiking was largely easy and we made it to the shelter just before 4. Our packs were heavy from resupply, so we were glad to be there to camp. We saw Desert Rose and her husband (Cactus Dan?), section hikers from the hostel, and later Wallace, Bones, Bama Dog and Peewee showed up. We all had fun talking and telling trail stories, and Tarzan made a fire for us. As I sit here in my tent typing this, I am finally finally caught up!! It feels good. Tonight is clear so we all left our rain flys off our tents so we can get more airflow and see the stars. I’m so grateful for such a great experience in Waynesboro and for all of the people who helped make that happen. I’m grateful for the companionship of good hikers tonight, and for a beautiful night to sleep outside. Tomorrow I am just going to aim for the next shelter 13 miles away.

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588991,"The morning today was lovely. Sleeping without the rainfly has been nice and breezy. I sat up in my bag and saw that camp was already stirring. Wallace, Bama Dog, Peewee, Whitewater all headed out early. In the end, Tarzan and I were the last in camp, and once I finished my breakfast and coffee I hit the trail. 
I stopped to get fresh water from the piped spring on the trail out. It was supposed to be quite warm today, up to 87, and water would be scarce. On my hike out I saw a deer in the middle of the trail. It stared back at me curiously. I also saw a red-headed woodpecker.
I spent most of the day trying to stay cool, re-applying sunscreen, and hiking on easy terrain. I had a 12 mile stretch without water and then stopped at the first hut (they call shelters “huts” in the Shenandoahs), Black Rock Hut, to get some water and cool down for a bit. Happy Feet was there and both Whitewater and Tarzan showed up. 
Whitewater, Tarzan and I decided we would push more miles and stop at the Loft Mountain Camp Store just off the AT. They were open until 7 and had some food and snacks. I pushed on, sweating buckets and covering my trekking pole handles with sunscreen from my hands, and at the top I scrambled to the Black Rock Mountain summit. It had some ice views and I took a picture of it to also remember the way the rock looked. 
Later on, Whitewater caught up to me and then we ran into Happy Feet again. We all marched on until we got to the camp store. It was like an oasis in the desert. I ate a buffalo chicken sandwich, a bag of Doritos, two orange creamsicle flavored whoopie pies, and a nestle toll house ice cream cookie sandwich. I washed all of that down with a Yoo-hoo. The camp store had coin showers and a laundromat. We opted to eat and move on. The 4 of us hiked out looking for a spot to camp, and ended up finding a spot just after seeing a lovely sunset view on the ridge. Someone came along and helped us get a group photo with the sunset.
It was a great day and I was grateful for the clear weather, even though it was relentlessly hot. I was grateful for the good food at the camp store, but mostly for the good companionship of my fellow hikers. I’m so tired!! Time for this cat to call it a night!","Calf Mountain Shelter

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589184,"I woke up to a beautiful sunrise this morning and a comfortable breeze blowing through camp. I woke at 5:30 and started getting my stuff organized. Tarzan, Happy Feet, and Whitewater also were stirring. We had our breakfasts and Happy Feet left first (she eats on the go), then Whitewater, and the Tarzan and I had our usual race to be last out of camp. He won.
I hiked out of camp at about 7:20 after my usual breakfast and coffee. I was on high alert for wildlife. It was overcast and a little cooler this morning, so the temperature was quite comfortable. I was hoping the bears might feel the same way and come out to play! After a mile and change, I stopped to filter water at a beautiful creek. 
When I reached Pinefield Hut, Tarzan (who had passed me at the watering hole) was there and Whitewater soon followed. We all had a snack there before continuing our trek. We climbed Weaver Mountain and then passed the 900 mile mark for the trail! I totally forgot to look for a marker - usually another thru hiker will create some kind of marker out of sticks or rocks. I climbed up High Top Mountain and before reaching the summit, stopped at High Top Hut. The sun had come out and the blistering heat was back. I think it was supposed to get up to 86 degrees today. Happy Feet and Bones were at the shelter. I ran down to get water from the spring after setting my pack down. I was sooooo hot and disgusting, with sweat salt rings on my clothes. I took a little bird bath at the spring, and then decided to rinse out my shirt, so took that off and cleaned it up in the stream. I went back up to the shelter and placed my wet shirt in the sun to dry. I took my shoes and socks off, drank a bunch of water and set about eating lunch. Tarzan rolled in and then Whitewater, as Bones marched north. Some day hikers stopped in to chat. We all sat there for a while just cooling off. While I was sitting there, I heard a noise next to me, and suddenly a mouse poked its head up from the base of the shelter floor. I grabbed my food bag as I thought maybe it was going for my food quite boldly, but then something interesting happened. The mouse poked its head back up, darted upwards into a wall crack, and then reappeared with a tiny fur ball in its mouth - a baby mouse! She then quickly carried the baby across the floor to a new location somewhere in a crack in the foundation. She went back and did this three or four times, relocating her babies right in front of us. Mice are a real pain at the shelters, but this was the cutest thing!
After this we headed out and climbed the rest of the way up High Top Mountain. I saw one of the day hikers again and she told me she had just seen a rattlesnake coiled up and sunning itself on a rock just off the east side of the trail. I looked for it on the way up but did not see it. 
The heat and sun were pretty brutal, and at the next Gap when I caught up to Happy Feet and Whitewater, they suggested stopping short of our original plan for roughly 25 miles. I was all for it and was already feeling drained by the heat. We decided we would walk to the next water source and then find a place to stealth camp. On the way out of the gap we found trail magic on a tree - bags of skittles!  It was pretty cool to find candy as I rarely carry it - I always go for chocolate. The next climb finished me off. I was happy to get to the spring we were looking for. We ended up camping on the old dirt road leading down to the spring. It’s definitely not the prettiest stealth campsite I’ve had, but the four of us were tired and wanted to camp by water.
No bears today, but I did see some deer. In fact, as the four of us were sitting cooking dinner, a deer walked right down near camp! It was pretty awesome! Today I had a lot of laughs with my fellow cohorts. I was grateful for that, for the views today, and that we got through cooking dinner before the rain came. As I lay in my tent, the rain is falling softly outside, pitter patter, pitter patter. Tomorrow is supposed to be wet, but the rain should cool things off some.","Stealth Campsite at Mile 892.3

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589232,"When I woke up on this fine Cinco de Mayo, the rain had largely stopped, except for a fine drizzle. I got up at 6 and organized myself a bit, and then went out to retrieve my food bag. Just as I got within sight of my hanging bag, I heard a crash and a huge deer leaped across the road and ran skillfully through the underbrush away from me. I was startled, but also amazed by how quickly it could move through thick brush. I almost cleared the entire road with its leap, leaving only one hoof print in the dirt. I walked back to my tent with my food bag. I decided I would have a quick morning to get on the trail and not boil water for coffee. It started sprinkling again and I didn’t really have a covered vestibule to cook in - my vestibule was pointing directly into the hill in front of me. I downed my oatmeal and pop tart in my tent, and the. Through my gear together. Whitewater was up and almost ready; Tarzan and Happy Feet were still in their tents. I took off down the trail, hoping for some good morning miles and maybe even a bear sighting. I was also hoping to reach the Big Meadows Wayside for lunch.  In the Shenandoah National Park they have camp stores and waysides that are varying distances off the trail. The camp stores have some resupply items and food you can microwave, or some prepackaged sandwiches (like a racetrac gas station). The Waysides have that, but also a cafe where you can sit down and order food. The Waysides are known for their blackberry milkshakes, so we were all obsessing over getting one. 
I walked along in peace, listening to birdsong and the hustle and bustle of squirrels and chipmunks. It rained off and on, but softly such that I wore shorts and a t-shirt but never put on rain gear. I climbed up Bearfence and Hazeltop Mountains. The trail was quite easy terrain and I made good time. I passed a group of ATC volunteers with trash bags who were collecting invasive species off the trail. They were focusing on Mustard Weed, which they said kills butterflies. Apparently it secretes some kind of toxic oil, the butterflies land on it and then die. I always thought it was beneficial for plants to have butterflies and largely symbiotic, so I am not sure why Mustard Weed would do this, but apparently it does.
I passed a tour group getting some kind of lecture from a ranger. They were nice and wished me luck on my hike! I kept my eyes peeled all morning, but I made it to the wayside without seeing any bears. I did, however, make another chipmunk scream. He was busy messing with something in the leaves and hopped up onto a log as I walked by. He turned around and realized I was right beside him. His face almost looked like some kind of Disney animation. His eyes got wide and his little hands spread out and he screamed and hopped into the leaves. Sorry little guy - I know I smell....
The wayside was a half mile uphill off the trail, but well worth it. When I got there it was hopping with tourists. I saw Wallace and Peewee inside. I dropped my pack outside and went into the cafe to sit with them. Wallace had already been there since breakfast, just cycling through mone! eals. It reminded me of when I did the same thing at Mojos back on my first day in Damascus. Today I was super hungry, so I ordered a pulled pork BBQ sandwich with fries, a side of Mac and cheese, a blackberry milkshake and a cup of coffee. It didn’t take long to polish all of that off, and then I ordered a second blackberry milkshake. Suddenly, I heard someone call my name and Nate was standing there, only he was all clean cut/shaven! I hadn’t seen him since after Mountain Harbour. Apparently he had taken some time off trail to meet with his wife and was just about to get back on. It was good to see him again! He’s still just Nate - no trail name yet! 
I downed my next milkshake in record time. They were so good that I took a photo of one! Peewee left to hike on, then Whitewater arrived and sat with Wallace and I. Wallace decided he’d been at the wayside long enough and said he was just going to walk 5 miles to the next Hut. When Whitewater finished her food, we both headed out. I thought I was going to push past the next Hut, but it was already 4 and Wallace said he heard that stealth camping options were bad to nonexistent in the next stretch. It started raining a bit heavier and the temperature was dropping, so I decided to just call it a day at the next Hut, Rock Spring Hut. I wanted to tent despite the rain. I like sleeping in my tent the best. After getting set up, I walked down to get water and noticed a cabin rental just down from the shelter on the way to the water source. It had a lovely covered porch setup and a picnic table there with a view of the valley. No one was in the cabin and it was locked up, so Whitewater, Wallace, Nate and I went down there to have dinner and chat. It was awesome! 
Today I was actually grateful for the rain. It cooled things down but stayed relatively light. I was also grateful for the smooth terrain, the wayside food and good company. Tomorrow it is supposed to rain as well. I hope it stays light of it does, but we will see!","Stealth Campsite at mile 911.1

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589363,"On the trail everything comes down to food, bodily functions, and gear. Nate had planted a seed last night about stopping at the Skyland Lodge restaurant for breakfast. It wasn’t far off the trail. At first I wasn’t going to go, but the more I thought about it the more it made sense. I might even be able to do a small resupply at the lodge and avoid stopping in Front Royal and go straight to Harpers Ferry. I had slept on a pitch last night and spent part of the night just trying not to roll off my sleeping pad. It wasn’t the best sleep I’ve had on the trail, but also definitely not the worst! I decided I would beeline for the Skyland restaurant that was about 4.5 miles away and take care of all of my eating and privy business there. I was very excited that it was not raining when I woke up and my tent rain fly was dry. I threw my gear together and headed out. Wallace and Peewee were up ahead; Whitewater and Nate were still at the shelter. Tarzan and Happy Feet never showed up at the shelter so we assumed maybe they had just stealth camped somewhere. They couldn’t be that far away. 
I hiked the 4.5 miles fast, passing Wallace and Peewee at some point. When I made it to the restaurant, the staff and servers were quite friendly and sat me down at a table with room for others. I then realized that they had a buffet option, which was a breakfast bar with all kinds of foods for only $14.95. It included coffee and juice, so I went for that. As I was having an omelette made and standing there at the omelette station shoving bacon, sausage and potatoes into my mouth with my fingers like a heathen, Peewee walked in, then Wallace. I got a plate full of home fries, pancakes, sausage, bacon, biscuits and gravy, and then the omelette, and sat down to eat. The three of us laughed and joked and went back for more food. I ate fruit and yogurt with granola as well. Nate arrived and then Whitewater, so our table was full of joking around. As Nate walked in, Wallace said “who’s this day hiker?” We often joke about how good the day hikers smell and how clean they are. Nate had really cleaned up on his visit with his wife and looked clean enough to pass for a day hiker. Nate has already walked almost half the trail without a trail name, so I jumped on this and told him I thought “Day Hiker” would be a hilarious trail name for him. The table agreed. I am not sure if it will stick yet. Hopefully I will see him tomorrow and can see how he’s feeling about it. I may suggest Dayglow as an alternate version in case he feels Day Hiker is too confusing since he’s thru hiking, though that is partially why it’s so funny. We’ll see what sticks!
After breakfast and using the facilities there, we headed out. Wallace, Whitewater and I headed out together. We decided to walk past the next two shelters and then maybe stealth camp somewhere. It was hard to walk at first. It looked and felt like I had a buffet baby bump! But as I got into my groove, I started to feel less full and more energized by the calories. I had also tucked a danish from the buffet in my pocket for later. Who doesn’t love a pocket danish?
We hiked past the side trail to Stony Man, the highest peak in the park and also said to have some of the best views, but we didn’t go up because everything around us was a foggy whiteout. We had better views at the Pinnacle and then Mary’s Rock overlook after Byrd’s Nest #3 Hut. It was awesome to watch the fog move around in the valley in patches here and there. It rained on us here and there, but it never poured. 
We stopped at Pass Mountain Hut for a short break and talked with two section hikers, a man and his son. The son lived in Washington DC and the father in Georgia. They were really nice. They told us that camping was allowed at Byrd’s Nest #4 picnic area, and so we decided to hike there as that would wrap up the hiking day around 5pm. We trekked in with that goal in mind.
I had seen a rabbit in the morning and we saw some orioles throughout the day. I was still hoping for a bear, but did not see one. We got to the camp site and were the only people there. Two rabbits stood downhill from us, sizing us up and doing their thing in the meadow. We set up our tents and then made dinner in the picnic area. Tomorrow we planned to hit another wayside for breakfast!
Today I was grateful for the cool temperatures, the awesome foggy views, the amazing buffet and the wonderful camaraderie on the trail. Wallace, Whitewater and I had a good time cracking up before we retired for the night. Tomorrow the weather is supposed to be nice!","Rock Spring Hut

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589495,"When I went to bed the air was heavy with moisture; when I woke up, things hadn’t changed. Everything felt like it had been dipped in mist. I was still able to start out in shorts and a t-shirt though, but would definitely need to dry out my tent/fly/footprint in the sun later. Wallace was out of camp first, then Whitewater, then me. I didn’t eat breakfast because I had one thing on my mind: the Elkwallow Wayside. It’s the last Wayside that serves food on the north end of Shenandoah National Park. Our plan was to go there, eat breakfast, dry our gear in the sun, and hopefully charge our phones, etc.
I thought leaving camp I might see two bunnies I had seen yesterday evening in the meadow in front of the shelter, but they must have slept in. I caught up to Whitewater and then we caught up to Wallace. I hoped we would see a bear on the way to the Wayside, but alas.... We were the first people at the Wayside when we arrived at 8:30. It didn’t open until 9, so we spread our wet gear out in the parking lot to dry, used the lovely restroom, and then plugged phones in to charge in the various open outlets near the drink and ice machines outside. Thru hikers generally are very good at scoping out available outlets both inside and outside places such as this, or in grocery stores, etc. By the time we got all of that done and threw our trash away in the trash bins there, the clock struck nine and the Wayside opened. 
The Wayside has a counter to order food, but then we just ate it outside at picnic tables. For round one I had a breakfast plate with two eggs, sausage, toast, and hash browns. I had coffee and a cinnamon roll with that. The cinnamon roll was awesome, but not Mojos awesome. For round two I had a bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich and another cinnamon roll, and then to cap that off I had a blackberry milkshake. After all of that, I purchased a few food items from the Wayside store so I can make it to Harpers Ferry without resupplying. 
While at the Wayside, we saw some other thru hikers come through. Nate showed up and he has embraced the trail name Day Hiker. YES!!! We all think it is a good name and quite funny. Bones came in, and I met Ghost and Poncho. I’d heard a lot of Poncho stories but hadn’t met him yet. He was pretty funny and was hiking in his underwear, which made me laugh. Ghost started on March 29, so he must be flying!
After chatting at the Wayside for a while, Wallace, Whitewater and I pushed on. It was a nice day for hiking. We took a break at the Gravel Springs Hut for lunch/snack and met a hiker who had thru hiked in 2014 named Nutella. He was pretty cool. All day today as we hiked I kept my eyes peeled for a bear. While I didn’t see one, I did get to see a Scarlet Tanager. There are lots of beautiful birds in the park. It’s full of Ovenbirds, and yesterday I saw quite a few Orioles. The Scarlet Tanager was my favorite though.
We hiked and hiked and saw many beautiful Shenandoah rolling hill views. Hogback overlook was pretty, and the views from Marshall mountain were stunning. I think part of what has made the Shenandoahs so fun is that the hiking has been a little bit of a break for us, the weather has been warm, and spring is really showing its colors and life now. Of course, it has also been nice having the camp stores and waysides around! I’ve also been lucky to have had really fun people to hike with along the way. 
We decided to hike not the Tom Floyd Wayside, which is the first shelter out of the park boundaries. I don’t know why it is called a Wayside - it’s just a shelter. When we got to the Compton Gap road crossing though, we had an awesome surprise! A guy named Ray was doing trail magic there, and it was some serious trail magic! He was cooking hot dogs and he had relish and onions for them. He had bananas and avocados, cookies and fig bars, potato chips and sodas - it was really incredible! He’s a section hiker and says he does trail magic a handful of times every year. It was great because there were about 7 of us there - Wallace, Whitewater, Bones, Ghost, and the Canadian couple I don’t think I had seen since the day I passed the Keffir Oak tree, The Kid and Soul Shine. We gorged ourselves and chatted, and then thanked Ray profusely as we left. I think that was the most comprehensive trail magic I have received yet! It was just awesome!
Bellies full, we hiked on for about 2.6 miles until we reached the shelter. The tent spots were few, so Wallace, Whitewater and myself ended up in the shelter. Day Hiker caught up to us, but opted to cowboy camp on the shelter porch since no rain was in the forecast. It was a long, good day! I’m surprised we walked 20 miles with all that time out for eating! I was so grateful for Ray and his trail magic, the good companionship and laughs I had today, as well as the wonderful weather. It’s a little sad to be out of the park, but new adventures await! Harper’s Ferry, here we come!","Byrd’s Nest #4 Day Use Picnic Area

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589602,"It was a good night. It didn’t rain, and mice didn’t walk on my face. I did wake up in the middle of the night to Day Hiker pausing by my head on his way out of the shelter to pee. It startled me for a second and we laughed about it in the morning, joking that I had woken up to see if he was a bear. I didn’t see a bear today either! 
We had a lazy morning at camp and then the four of us headed out around 8 - Whitewater, Wallace, Day Hiker, and me. Whitewater had a box to pick up just 0.1 off the trail at the US 522 at a little hostel called Mountain Home Cabbin. I don’t know why they use two b’s.... The guidebooks said they had free lemonade and cookies for hikers, so we decided to tag along with Whitewater to see if this dream could become a reality. 
The four of us hiked like we were on a mission. Visions of lemonade ran through my head. When we got to the hostel, the owner came out (Lisa, I think) and showed us to the cabin. There was another thru hiker, Sky, there. Lisa was awesome and very welcoming and generous. We had lemonade and animal crackers and checked through the hiker box there. The rooms in the little cabin looked really nice and it seemed like a great place to stay.
When Whitewater had organized her food from the box shipment, we packed up and left. The day was getting hot, but the trail was definitely starting to look a bit more like the green tunnel everyone talks about. There were tons of trillium and other flowers along the way. Spring is really and solidly here! 
The terrain today, with the exception of s couple hills and short rocky sections, was pretty easy. I made faster time than usual. We stopped into the Jim and Molly Denton Shelter for lunch, and who was there but Happy Feet! Yesterday Ray the trail angel had said that she was in front of us, which meant she must have passed us when we were at Elkwallow Wayside. It was a fun lunch reunion and our group for the day grew by one. Now we were just missing Tarzan, who I later found out was back in Front Royal picking up a package. We ate lunch at the shelter and also checked out their solar shower that they had there. Unfortunately it was not working, so after our food we headed out. Day Hiker, Wallace and I jumped ahead and walked through the hot afternoon sun. We stopped and talked with some construction workers at a road crossing as they were curious about our hike. At one point, I almost stepped on yet another black king snake. Day Hiker tried to grab it by the tail as it did not want to move out of the trail. It didn’t like that much, but then he used his trekking pole to lift it and move it to the side. That snake really didn’t want to leave the trail!
We walked and walked through the forest, passing deer, rabbits, large red-headed woodpeckers, and the usual allotment of chipmunks and squirrels. We made it to the Whiskey Hollow shelter right by Whiskey Hollow creek. There are actually two shelters here. Dick’s Dome is the original, smaller shelter. It is oddly shaped kind of like a Dome. Whiskey Hollow is the newer, larger one. Whiskey Hollow was really nice and had a great porch and common area, so we decided to sleep there. Day Hiker, Wallace and I chatted as we waited on the girls to arrive. I went down to the creek and got water, soaked my feet, and washed out the clothes I was wearing. I gave myself a little bath in the creek and tried to rinse the salt out of my hair. It felt good! My clothes will probably still be wet in the morning, but at least they won’t be salty!
When Whitewater and Happy Feet arrived, we all made food and chatted and talked about Harpers Ferry, getting there, and resupply after that. It was a great day and a good evening! I was grateful for the easy and forgiving terrain today, the good weather and the excellent company. Tomorrow will probably be a longer day, but I guess I’ll see what the trail brings!","Tom Floyd Wayside

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589716,"Last night was interesting. I woke up in the middle of the night / early morning to the sound of gnawing. That’s never good in a Shelter right? Something was chewing on something. I turned my red headlamp on and started shining it around. Nothing.... i crept around to the packs hanging on the wall and still didn’t see anything. I couldn’t tell where the sound was coming from. I finally gave up and went back to sleep. I sort of expected that one of us would get surprised with holes in our gear in the morning, but no one did! Others had heard the noise as well. I guess it will remain a mystery....
We got up early and had breakfast. Usually I am the only one who has coffee in the morning, but today so did Wallace and Whitewater. My shorts and t-shirt were still damp from the creek washing I had given them yesterday, as were my socks. I put them on anyway because it would be hot today, and I put on some fresh socks. I used my safety pins to pin my damp socks to the back of my pack to dry in the sun. Today the plan was to hike just past the first VA/WV border about 21 miles away. The trail dips into and out of WV before entering Harpers Ferry, so we are calling it the fake border.
The day was cool in the morning but quickly got hot. I lead the hiking this morning, so I got to eat lots of spider webs along the way. I saw some deer throughout the day, and a few nicely sized rabbits. After we passed Rod Hollow Shelter, we came upon a sign announcing that we were entering the Roller Coaster, described by the AWOL guide as a roughly “13.5 mile section of trail with many tightly packed ascents and descents.” That was pretty accurate! It was hot and Virginia had lulled us to sleep with easy trail, so this section kicked my butt a little. It was quite rocky in some places as well. We got some great trail magic at Morgan Mill Road from Sniffles, a thru hiker (flip flop) from last year. He’s an actor from DC and had cold drinks, oranges, watermelon, apples, grapes - it was awesome! Fruit on the trail always feels so good! We chatted with Sniffles for a bit and then pushed on up Buzzard Hill.
It was just after Buzzard Hill that we hit the 1000 mile mark. It was an exciting moment, but honestly I don’t entirely know why. I think it was exciting to know we had come so far, to know that those 1000 miles were hard earned, full of snow and ice, blood and sweat. We will be in Harpers Ferry soon and that is a symbolic halfway point (not quite actually half way), so the 1000 miles is significant from that angle as well. We took a group photo there, our motley crew of five. I was grateful to have reached this milestone with people I enjoy being with. Good people. It’s also interesting to think that, as much as we have been through, we still have more than half the journey to go! I hope that I can learn as much about myself in the next 1000 as I have in the first!
We kept going, jubilant, through the roller coaster until we got to Snickers Gap. There Wallace and Day Hiker peeled off to hike to a restaurant nearby. I wanted to, but couldn’t stomach the extra 0.6 miles since I was so tired, so I continued on a mile or so with Happy Feet and Whitewater and ate ramen at camp. The guys joined us later on. We had a great time chatting and Whitewater was awesome and gave me a nutty buddy to eat. We all listened to and sang “Country Roads” by John Denver. We would dip into and out of West Virginia tomorrow! 
I was grateful for pretty much everything today - the weather, the green tunnel finally looking like a green tunnel, good company and lots of laughs. I’m grateful to have had 1000 miles to hike and have this great experience. I felt a little emotional thinking about it. Sometimes I don’t know how I can go back, back to whatever real life is. Maybe I can send a trail angel to scoop up my wife and kitty and whisk them to the trail with me! I guess I have more than 1000 more miles before I have to think about the journey ending. Life out here is simple and good. I lose track of the date, and the days go by fast and beautifully as I just walk north. I don’t need a compass out here; I just follow the blazes.

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589850,"It was nice sleeping without a rain fly last night. Other than some weird screeching noises from something in the woods (spring is mating season, after all), the night was peaceful. When I woke up at 6, I did my usual routine. Usually the first thing I do is unscrew the air valve in my sleeping pad and lay there as all the air is expunged. It’s the best way for me to get moving because I quickly become uncomfortable lying down! I went out to get my food bag down and saw two deer who didn’t like my morning look and promptly ran away, flicking their white tails as they leaped off. 
I joined the others for breakfast. I skipped coffee as I was low on fuel, but had two packs of oatmeal and set off. We all hiked together up to a nice viewpoint and took a snack break. We were finishing up the last leg of the roller coaster section and the view was lovely! I decided to cut the break short and hike on my own for a bit, so I headed out. I also wanted to get to the Sweet Springs Store / gas station 0.3 miles off the trail at Keys Gap to get some food and ice cream! I hiked on and soon reached the end of the roller coaster section. The terrain leveled out a bit, but was pretty rocky so it was hard to turn on the cruise control. Rumblings of thunder sounded in the distance and a few rain drops began to sprinkle down. Now that it is warmer, I usually don’t use my rain gear unless it is a complete downpour. If I put it on I just get hot and soaked with sweat, and then my shirt gets salt deposits in it. If I just let it rain on me, I get wet from the rain but I stay cooler and don’t accumulate salt. I ignored the rain, largely because I could still hear the birds chirping and singing. Clearly they weren’t worried about taking cover! I passed another hiker putting on his rain suit. One of the reasons I like hiking is that everyone has his own system for doing things, and that’s ok. It’s all good as long as it works for you! I wondered if I would be putting my rain jacket on in a few minutes, but in the end it never did more than sprinkle. 
I ran into a trail maintenance crew from the Blackburn Center, owned by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club. They were nice folks and I asked them if the Center had a shower. Guthook mentioned solar showers, but they said there was no shower. I decided to skip the Center as it was a quarter mile off the trail and there wasn’t really anything I wanted to see there. Apparently, on clear days you can see the Washington Monument from the Center. The others did go there and later told me that they could not see the monument today. 
I pushed on for food, watching two or three deer bound off into the brush off the trail. I saw a little box turtle on the trail and stopped to have a look. I took a picture and moved on, as he was keen to get away from me. I love turtles! I enjoyed the sanctity of having the woods to myself for the afternoon, listening to the birds sing and picking my way carefully over rocks at times. When I got down to Keys Gap, I hung a right on the road and walked along with busy traffic zooming beside me. I walked past the remains of a poor raccoon that needing some piecing together to figure out it used to be a raccoon. The head was completely off and turned backwards and smooshed, but somehow amazingly the teeth were perfectly preserved and white. It was horrifying, but I couldn’t not look! I held my breath, anticipating putrid smells and marched on. It reminded me of the roadkill wax museum on the walk towards Mountain Harbour.
I got to the Sweet Springs store and set my pack and trekking poles down outside. The store was a gas station with a wide variety of gas station snacks and food, and it had a deli counter that served hot food. It was heaven! I ordered a cheeseburger with fries and mozzarella sticks, and got a Barq’s root beer to go with it. I sat outside against the gas station wall and ate those as there was no indoor seating. There was an outlet above my pack, so I charged my phone while I ate. I then went back in and got a peanut butter cup milkshake. I picked up some M&Ms for later, as well as a jumbo iced honey bun for breakfast tomorrow. The milkshake was awesome, so I got another (this time cookies and cream) and ordered an Italian sub to pack out. The others still hadn’t shown up and I had been hanging out for a little over an hour, so I decided to hike on. The cashier was quite nice and let me fill my water bottles in their sink before I left.
I saw the others at the road gap. I told them I was still going to have an early day and camp about 4 miles from town. I also warned them about the mangled raccoon - try not to look, if you can! I noticed the West Virginia welcome sign to the west of the gap. To the east there was a Welcome to Virginia sign. 
I walked the line about 2 miles in, found the campsite, and stopped for the day. It was early - about 3/3:30. I love getting to camp early! The thunder returned as I pitched my tent. I got everything set up just as some rain came, but I only briefly huddled in my tent before it lightened and then stopped. I did some reading up on trail stops and when the gang showed up, I socialized with them and whatnot. Whitewater built a fire, which was nice. It was a good day. Tomorrow we will all be up early to get to Harpers Ferry and the ATC in time for a shuttle to get to Walmart to resupply. I’m excited about seeing the town and the ATC headquarters!
I was grateful to have some solo hiking time today to commune with nature, grateful that the rain was uneventful, and grateful for the good food and camp fun today. Tomorrow is going to be fun!Postscript: thanks again everyone for the encouraging comments and thoughts! They are much appreciated!","Stealth Campsite at mile 1005.7

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589978,"Everybody got up early this morning. We wanted to try to get into Harpers Ferry in time to have breakfast before the shuttle from the ATC headquarters to Walmart for our resupply. Our information said that there was a bus at 9:05 that we could flag down at the ATC. I shoved a jumbo iced honeybun in my mouth and we all took off as 710 calories driven by simple carbohydrates hot my system like a team of horses. Vroooom!!! (The sound a team of horses makes, or a fast car). 
We saw a few deer hiking out of camp and enjoyed a rocky farewell to Virginia. It was really cool descending down into Harper’s Ferry. First we saw the Shenandoah River, and then we saw the busy bridge we would cross over into Harpers Ferry, before the confluence with the Potomac River. We walked next to fast moving cars on the bridge, but it was still an amazing feeling. On the other side we headed up again, back into the woods, and saw two more deer right as we got to the side trail that leads to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy Headquarters. We took that trail, which was cool because it passed by the John Brown memorial and through the Storer College campus where the first meeting of the Niagara Movement was held, as well as other historic sites. There are markers and information there about the armory and other sites within town.  I could go on, but there is a lot of history in the town and in nearby Charles Town, founded by George Washington’s brother.  The Storer campus is now part of the Harpers Ferry National Historic Park. I didn’t dip into the various Civil War sites and museums, but there must be some in town because Harpers was a hot mess during the Civil War. I think it changed hands between the two sides seven or eight times, and Stonewall Jackson had some glory there at one point forcing a huge surrender of union troops. Suffice it to say, it is historic for many reasons.
The ATC headquarters is a modest building north of the Storer campus. Nevertheless, it was a bit like Mecca for us. We got there just before 8am, so it was closed (opens at 9). We decided to walk into town to see if we could get a coffee or a quick breakfast. We walked half a mile into the historic old town. Even at 8am, nothing was open! There were signs on various cafes that they were permanently closed, and others didn’t open until 10. It was like the town was dead! We walked back to the ATC headquarters to wait for it to open at 9. When it did, we found out that the bus comes by the ATC at 9:11, so a few minutes off the time in Wallace’s guidebook but still close. We just had to have $2.50 exact change and flag it down. The ATC headquarters provided change if we needed it, which was cool. We didn’t have time to look around there before the bus came, but would when we came back. They also let us leave our packs and trekking poles there while we resupplied, which was awesome. 
We flagged the bus down and it dropped us at Walmart in Charles Town. There isn’t a place to resupply in Harpers Ferry itself The ATC had given us a bus schedule, so we had that and there were multiple times to get back. We were all starving though, so we walked a mile and a half on the highway to an IHOP. I gorged myself, drinking countless cups of coffee. I had stuffed French toast with strawberry vanilla topping, two eggs, two pieces of sausage, and hash browns. I then had four blueberry pancakes. Yeah.... The young Happy Feet has never been to an IHOP before, so it was a first for her. We all thoroughly enjoyed it, and then stopped by Taco Bell on the walk back to Walmart to get some food to pack out. I got a seven layer burrito and grabbed a bunch of fire sauce. 
At Walmart we all dispersed to resupply, aiming for the 1:20 (or thereabouts) shuttle back. I bought so much food! I shouldn’t have gotten as much as I did. I got some clementines to get some vitamin c as well. No trail scurvy! The bus came and Day Hiker hopped on and put his $2.50 in the deposit box. The bus driver then told him she wasn’t going back to Harpers Ferry until 4:30! What?! The ATC didn’t even have a correct bus schedule for the one bus hikers take to resupply.... That seemed a little crazy. The bus left and so we decided to call the ATC to see if there might be any trail angels who could help us get back to Harpers from Charles Town. They supposedly had a list of trail angels at the ATC. We had to get to the post office before it closed, so the later shuttle wouldn’t work. I called the ATC number and no one picked up the phone.... Hitching is not legal in West Virginia and we had been warned about tickets, so I broke down and called an Uber. It was pricey, but that worked and we had a great Uber driver who was there in 15-20 minutes and got us right back to Harpers.
Once back in town those of us who needed to go to the post office did. I had a new pair of shoes there and some permethrin that I bounced to Boiling Springs, PA. I actually didn’t bounce it; I mailed it for $8.50 by priority mail. Apparently you can only bounce priority mailed packages (and they have to remain unopened). Now I know, and I won’t have to pay again to bounce them further north if I still have more life in my current shoes when I get to Boiling Springs.
After the post office, we all hung out at the ATC headquarters for a bit. I enjoyed looking at the exhibits there, and especially at the photo book to see who had already come through who I either knew or had heard of. Of course, we all got our official hiker photos taken. That was exciting! They give everyone a number so you know how many thru hikers before you reached Harpers Ferry from Springer Mountain in Georgia. I was number 169. When I started in Georgia, I was number 371! A lot of people have dropped out I guess....  We took out time looking around at the ATC and hanging out organizing and breaking down our resupply. It was great, and they had WiFi and places to charge our phones, as well as sodas for sale. 
We finally decided to leave so that we could hit the outfitter (a few of us needed gas canisters) and the ice cream shop on the way out of town. We went back down the trail and followed it around to town. It passed by the famous Jefferson Rock, where Thomas Jefferson had stood on a visit to view the impressive Shenandoah river, and then into the bottom of old town near the confluence of the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers. The ice cream shop was a real gathering point for thru hikers! I saw Zia Fox, Fifty, Cheddar, Poncho, and Clothesline, of all folks! I had been wondering what happened to Skates and Clothesline, my two friends from Mt. Pleasant who suffered through the Hot Springs blizzard with me. Skates got off the trail for financial reasons and because he felt he got what he wanted out of his journey. Clothesline got off for a bit due to injury, but is now doing sections. He is not pursuing a thru hike this year anymore. He will probably pass me as they have covered some territory north of here slack packing. Apparently Candyman and Stumbles were in town as well, though I did not see them. After sucking down a mint chocolate chip milkshake and socializing a bit, it was already 4:30 so it was time to find a place to camp. 
The walk out of town was awesome! There is a park and some historic plaques at the rivers’ confluence. I met some tourists from Taiwan and exercised my Mandarin a bit. We then walked on a bridge alongside train tracks and a train trestle over the Potomac river just before the confluence. The bridge was architecturally interesting, and where the train tracks disappeared into the mountain tunnel it said “1931 Harpers Ferry.” I’m guessing that’s when the tunnel was completed.  The AT descends down stairs rather than going into the tunnel, and then follows a bike/walking path along the Potomac. We found a spot along the river with a fire ring and decided to drop and camp. It was getting into the evening and our packs were heavy. We had walked a lot today, even if many of the miles were not AT miles. All in all, I loved the Harpers Ferry experience! I liked the way the trail weaves through town, and all of the history was excellent. I really enjoyed the ATC headquarters and the people there were awesome! It was a bit weird that the town didn’t seem more ready for hikers. It was so dead in the morning and many places were closed, and I would have thought the ATC would be on top of things like the bus schedule. Maybe we really are super early in the season.... Ot didn’t feel like a hiker town, and maybe it is more of a historic town anyway - I’m not sure if hikers are a big part of the local economy. A lot of our money went to neighboring Charles Town by necessity. Anyway, those details didn’t detract from my experience - it was great!
I was grateful to finally make it to Harpers and see the ATC HQ, as well as get to experience walking in all the way from Georgia! That felt pretty amazing. It was incredible to get into the hiker book at the ATC. I had an awesome time with my fellow hikers today and overall am just so incredibly grateful that I have been able to take this journey, take it this far, and that I will wake up tomorrow and keep walking.","Campsite at Mile 1020.7

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590173,"Well, last night was interesting. We didn’t make it very far out of Harpers Ferry and ended up camping by the Potomac river bank. Yay! On our other side were the train tracks.... Hiking out in the afternoon we only saw one or two trains. After dark, it was like we were at Penn Station or something. Train after train after train came by. I had my earplugs in, but they were deafening and shook the ground. At one point a train slowed down to an almost stop and we could hear the cars banging together. The best was when one of the trains somehow shined lights on us. We aren’t sure how that happened, but Wallace said in the morning that he thought the train was coming into camp. I woke at 5am and thought about going back to sleep for 30 minutes, but then two more trains came through so I decided to just get up. I could hear the others moving too. Whitewater was out first, and Day Hiker, Wallace and I headed out not too long after. Happy Feet was still at camp when we left. 
It was nice getting going early because it was cool out. We were all aiming for the Dahlgren campground 15 miles away because it had a shower. I hadn’t showered since Waynesboro before the Shenandoahs, and the last time Wallace showered was in Glasgow. It was time. It’s funny how after a while I really don’t care that much about being dirty. I’m gross, but I notice it less. Showers after it has been a while do feel amazing though! We walked along and climbed out of Harpers Ferry, and eventually caught up with Whitewater. We stopped at the first shelter and got water and a snack. Water was a quarter mile down a hill. Wallace and I joked that we shouldn’t have gone down there but we were too far down the hill to turn back. At the shelter, we met a Canadian flip flopper heading north. I forgot her name unfortunately, but it was her second day on the trail. It was cool to see someone on her second day as I am approaching the halfway point. She has so much adventure to look forward to! I thought about my second day and what that was like, leaving Three Forks and staying at my first shelter where a mouse ate the hat of the guy next to me. Good times!
We left the shelter and at some point I pulled ahead. The day’s hiking was humid and rocky. I passed lots of day hikers, runners, section hikers, and groups of people out in nature. The trail passed through Gathland State Park and also Crampton Gap, so there were a lot of informational plaques to read about these sites.  Crampton was really interesting in how it played into the siege for Harpers Ferry during the Civil War. I also enjoyed reading about General Lee’s lost orders that fell into Union hands. They basically detailed his plan to take Harpers Ferry and were found by union soldiers and delivered to General McClellan. The irony is that there was a time delay and so McClellan still couldn’t move fast enough to destroy Lee’s army. That’s the cliff notes version anyway. It was neat to actually hike through these locations and read about the history there. 
When I got to the Dahlgren campground it was only about 1pm, but I had hiked 15 miles and I had work to do. I needed to wash clothes and shower! The bathrooms there were awesome and had two showers in each bathroom. They also had an electrical outlet to charge phones, hot water, toilet paper and real toilets, and potable water. I showered with my Dr. Bronners soap and it felt amazing. I was so dirty! I washed my hair three times and scrubbed myself. I used my buff to pat dry, out on my pants, and then set about washing my daily hiking clothes and socks in the sink. It was hot and sunny out, so I was able to set my clean clothes in the sun to dry. The others were at camp as well, taking care of the same chores. We all sat at a picnic table and ate lunch in the shade, and pretty much stayed at that picnic table through dinner. The campground filled up and a ridge runner named Kiki (his trail name from his 2015 thru hike) stopped by and brought us pizza! It was an awesome and unexpected surprise!! He was just starting his job as a ridge runner. For only walking 15 miles today, I definitely had a lot of food!! It was a great day. Happy Feet showed up, but pushed on a bit farther after showering. Zia camped here as well. 
I was grateful to have a great day of hiking through a historic park and by so many landmarks. I was also super grateful to have a wonderful campsite to clean up at. Tonight it is storming and there is a severe thunderstorm watch, so I am listening to the wind and rain as I prepare for sleep. Tomorrow is supposed to be wet, but with any luck maybe it won’t be too bad. The trail always gives me what I need.... Lastly, today was my Mom’s birthday, so I am grateful that I had a signal and could call her to wish her happy birthday. Tomorrow is Mother’s Day so I hope her fun weekend continues since she is the best mother ever! Thanks for all the love and support Ma!!","Stealth Campsite at Mile 1027

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590604,"It stormed most of the night, but when I woke up at 5am it had stopped raining. I decided to go ahead and get up and take advantage of the fact that it wasn’t pouring down to get ready to hike. I had a quick breakfast of oatmeal in my tent, then broke everything down and organized my pack by the bathroom. It was nice to be able to wash my hands and throw my trash away there, not to mention get water! I said goodbye to the gang who were still in various stages of assembly. As I walked out, I saw Poncho hike towards the bathroom in his underwear. I met Poncho once in the Shenandoahs. He’s a really nice guy. I guess he is going ultralight or something, but he hikes in boxer briefs. He’ll put on pants if he goes into a town. Everyone has his style!
I hiked out of camp with a good solid pace. I knew the others were going to target a shelter about 18 miles away. I figured I would go there and then see how I felt, but in the back of my mind I was entertaining the idea of having a bigger day and going farther. As I walked along the fog was thick. I passed through the park where the George Washington Monument is. Unlike the one in DC, this one is like a smaller cylindrical stone feature. It was very foggy, but I snapped a picture before moving on. On the trail up to the monument there were signs noting milestones in Washington’s life. I enjoyed reading them as I walked.
After the monument, it started raining again. I hiked faster to stay warm. I haven’t been wearing my rain jacket much. It’s warm enough now to where I’m largely ok just getting wet. I could put on rain gear but then I sweat, and if I’m going to get wet I might as well not have salt deposits on my body. Unfortunately, the rain and fog obscured all of my views today. I still took the side trails just for kicks, but at Annapolis Rocks, for example, I saw nothing but white. I saw a few deer and a lot of hikers though. Some of them were section hikers and others were starting flip flops.
Overall the day was just a solid day of hiking. At some point the Forrest Gump effect kicked in and my legs just kept going and going! I took some breaks and stopped at a shelter for lunch. The rain took a break for a while but then showed up later in the evening again. At Penn Mar picnic area I passed Happy Feet. I don’t know where she camped on the trail the night before when we were at Dahlgren, but the trail is funny like that - we often leapfrog each other. Not too long after that I crossed over the Mason Dixon line. I was in Pennsylvania! It was a cool feeling to get to a new state so quickly. I’d been in 4 states over the last week! 
When I got to Deer Lick Shelters I realized there were actually two small shelters there. There were four people there: flip floppers and section hikers. They were really nice and I talked with the two flip floppers for a while while I cooked my dinner. Right before I finished dinner, Happy Feet showed up. She opted for the shelter. There was room in the shelter, but I decided to tent. My tent was a bit wet from last night, but I used one of my socks to wipe down the inside. I had somehow walked just over 28 miles, and I definitely could feel that. It was all I could do not to fall asleep sitting up. I was grateful for the strength to walk today, and for some solitude with the woods while hiking. I was also grateful for the rain that cooled things down. It was a good long day.","Dahlgren Backpack Campground

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590605,"I was so tired last night! The miles wore me out, and at one point I fell asleep with my headlamp still burning. I slept well, but everything was damp when I woke up. I got my food bag down. It looked like I was the only one up. I went back to my tent, ate in the vestibule, and proceeded to get organized to hike. I broke down my soggy tent and saw Happy Feet eating breakfast at the picnic table. I walked over and packed up my pack there, chatting with her briefly. I noticed a large snail on a tree and took a picture of it as it snaked along, enjoying the moist morning. I would not be like the snail today - it was time to move on and hike!
The morning brought a few rabbits, deer, and a cool box turtle. The rain held off and there was only a light sprinkling or a foggy mist in the morning. I passed Old Forge Park and Tumbling Run Shelter. So far PA has some pretty amazing shelters! Tumbling run had two shelter buildings and a center pavilion with a covered picnic table. I hiked through the morning alone, sometimes running into people. I saw two monks leading a group of hikers southbound. I said hello and quickly figured out they must be doing some kind of vow of silence trip. Some sort of whispered hello back, but many gave a thumbs up or made a sign like “I can’t speak.” 
As the morning turned to midday, the sun decided to come out of hiding. Not too long after, I walked into Caledonia State Park. I read that they have a concession stand, but when I walked into the park it was closed. They did have water fountains though, so I grabbed some water and took my pack off in an expansive sunny concrete area to dry some things out. In true hiker trash fashion, I spread my tent and wet stuff out all over the pavilion, and laid my sleeping bag out to crisp up in the sun. I sat in some nearby shade and ate lunch while watching two carpenter bees battle for turf. It was pretty brutal. In the end, one of the bees actually almost killed, or killed, the other bee. It sat there hovering by the bee making sure it wouldn’t get up and fly. Nature is so awesomely cruel sometimes!
I stayed for about an hour. When my stuff was dry I packed up and headed out into the hot sun. As I walked out of the park I heard someone call my name, turned around and it was Durwood! He was with two other guys. We caught up for a few minutes - it was good to see him again. After that I hiked up the hill and past another amazing shelter that actually had a porch swing and potted flowers. Apparently it has a caretaker!
It was a longish climb up and it started to thunder and sprinkle. Fortunately, the rain never got heavy. I passed a cool cabin called the Milesburn Cabin that apparently is for rental. I splashed my face in the creek there and moved on. I hiked past a thick, dark pine forest that was absolutely beautiful. It was so thick and dark and quiet beneath its humble canopy. Not long after, I arrived at Birch Run Shelter, my stopping point for the night. There was one north bounder I met in the Shenandoahs named Cody Coyote, a section hiker, and a family of flip floppers:  Mom, Dad, son and grandmother all hiking the trail!  We chatted while I made food and filtered water. I was pretty beat and decided to just sleep in the shelter as more rain was coming. As we drifted off to sleep, a whippoorwill landed on the shelter and started calling “whippoorwill “ over and over and over at the top of its lungs.  It seriously sounded like some kind of whacky car alarm. Finally it went away after a comically long concert.
Today I was grateful for some sunshine and to be able to dry out my gear. I enjoyed the misty views of the forest and the sounds of the birds. Tomorrow I will reach the actual halfway point! I also have a decision to make: to half gallon challenge or not to half gallon challenge? I’ll decide tomorrow!
Postscript:
#1 - Ken, thanks for asking! We did catch up with Happy Feet. Also, we did get some storms but not too bad. It’s been kind of wet the last 3 days and seems like that will continue. It’s warm though!","Deer Lick Shelters
",Birch Run Shelter,"May 14, Mon",23.20
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590611,"The Whippoorwill came back. It decided an evening chorus wasn’t enough and decided to do a repeat at 5am. Cody Coyote was already getting ready as he planned to hike big miles today. The rest of us got up though because, well, the Whippoorwill basically told us to with his looney tunes car alarm song. It wasn’t raining, which was great. Happy Feet and I headed out as quickly as possible for the same reason - there was much to see and do today. 
It didn’t take long to get to the halfway point at mile 1096. This was an exciting moment, and for me more meaningful than making it to Harpers Ferry, though definitely less interesting. I took a picture of the halfway sign. We both signed the log book there, and I ate a snickers to celebrate. While we were sitting down, an old man pulled up in a truck to ask us if we had seen any turkeys (I think he wanted to shoot them) and warn us about bears and snakes. He mentioned a fire and I wasn’t sure what he was talking about until I walked a little further and saw that, indeed, across the road at the midpoint there was significant fire damage. It looked fairly recent as there was no regrowth of underbrush.
I hiked on and turned on a bit of speed. I was hungry and my next stop was Pine Grove Furnace State Park, Home of the famous Half Gallon Challenge. You basically have to eat a half gallon of ice cream and you get a wooden spoon that says “half gallon challenge.”  Also at the park is the AT museum, with all kinds of history on the AT. When I got to the park the General Store was closed, so I went to the museum first. The museum was really awesome and had lots of great exhibits on AT history. I actually liked it better than the info at Harpers Ferry, though I liked that too. They also had a nice hiker lounge and charging station for phones, and an old dog that was really cute and friendly. He followed me around the exhibits to be petted.
After I looked at the museum, I heard that the general store had opened, so I went over and saw Happy Feet there, along with some sectioners and flip floppers. We all waited outside while the store prepared for us, and then we went in like the horde of locusts we are. I wasn’t sure if they only had ice cream, but it turns out they had all kinds of burgers and sandwiches. I really really wanted a burger, so I opted to get their Hiker Burger, which was a bacon cheeseburger with avocado and lots of delicious toppings on a ciabatta bun. I washed it down with a Mountain Dew, which I never drank, but I had it in honor of Wallace (it’s his favorite). After that I had an ice cream cone with two scoops. I opted to not do the half gallon challenge. I didn’t want to feel sick and I knew I would if I ate that much ice cream. A cone was enough! I mean, I probably could have had two cones, but I need to watch my figure. 
After eating, Happy Feet and I hiked on to the lake. They have a lake with a beach at the park. I wanted to check out the free showers there and she wanted to swim. The lake had a sand beach - it was pretty cool. There were a million little kids running around the picnic area - part of a school field trip. As I walked away from the beach and said I wasn’t going to swim, Happy Feet said I would regret it. I went to the bathrooms anyway and the shower room was great! Then I started thinking - maybe I would regret it! So I ran back outside with my pack and went for a short dip in my hiking shorts. It was so cold! The water felt really good on my feet though. I didn’t stay in long and went to shower. I knew the sad reality was that I would be sweating and stinky 10 minutes after I started hiking again. It was hot today - maybe high 80s. But, mentally it felt good to shower, and it was good to get salt off my body and put god my hair. 
After the shower, I headed out. I waked with Happy Feet for a little bit. An older lady took a picture of us. I’m not sure why. We didn’t even pose so I think she got my back. I think she was impressed that we were hiking the whole thing, and more impressed that Happy Feet was so young and a female AND thru hiking. It is pretty impressive at her age! We laughed about her taking the picture and then I turned on the speed and hiked on my own for a while. The goal was to get to the James Fry shelter. I thought about pushing farther, but that thought faded quickly. 
About two miles from the shelter the wind picked up, it started thundering, and I felt the temperature drop about 5 degrees. Uh oh.... Living most of my life in the south, I know what that means all too well! I started to hustle and walk faster. As the thunder picked up and it started to rain, I broke into a jog. Too late! The heavens poured down and I got completely drenched; however, I did manage to make it to the shelter before the hail fell. Chickpea sized hail bounced off the roof and off the bodies of the hikers still strewn along the trail. I was the first person at the shelter and got my stuff set up after wringing out my shirt. I felt good to have a dry place to sleep for the night.
Other hikers showed up - the same sectioners and flip floppers from Pine Grove, and Happy Feet made it in. We all chatted a bit and ate. I worked on my hiking plans and next resupply and double checked mileage. It was a good evening. Because I hiked so many miles over the last few days, I had extra food and so I ate more than usual for dinner - yay!
I was grateful for Pine Grove today, especially the museum and the food. It was nice making it to the halfway point with another thru hiker who I had hiked with. It was a great day. Hopefully there are no Whippoorwills at this shelter....","Birch Run Shelter
",James Fry Shelter,"May 15, Tue",17.10
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590851,"At 4:30 AM I woke up to a chorus of snoring. There was a deep sleep apnea-esque snore, and a little squeaky lady snore, and then kind of a Justin Timberlake pitched snore. You know - when he hits those high notes where he closes his eyes and puts one hand to an ear and it’s a little nasally. They came together in a strange kind of chorus, kind of like if you had a tuba, a piccolo, and a kazoo each play in a different key, but somehow it still worked. I felt like after each wave of snoring a cymbal crash would be a good addition. I had planned on getting up at 5, so I tried to go back to sleep, but couldn’t. At ten till, I went ahead and got up, trying to get myself and my gear together as quietly as possible. I was on the trail by 6am!
It was raining lightly. I wore the usual damp shorts and t shirt from yesterday. I liked being on the trail super early! I had a big goal today, which was to make it to Darlington shelter if possible. This would be tough though because I would pass through trail town Boiling Springs and I needed to go to the post office there. Of course, I also wanted to eat there. I made good time despite the rain and ran into a couple heading southbound named Coach  and Flip. They have hiked most of the AT previously and are currently trying to finish up a few remaining stretches in their retirement. They are both retired PE teachers! They told me the rocks get worse after Port Clinton, so I decided that when I got to Boiling Springs I would bounce my shoes to Port Clinton. 
On the way into Boiling Springs there was a great section where the trail passed in between giant boulders, weaving in and around them like a giant rock maze. It was really fun and I was glad for the easy to follow blazes that lead me through the twisty path. Walking into Boiling Springs was nice too. The trail crosses a few footbridges into a park with an old iron furnace, leftover from its iron industry days. I wanted to take a picture of this, but the moisture was making my phone touchscreen act up so I did not. It was pretty cool looking and made of stone. A local guy chatted me up in the park, and this would be a theme in Boiling Springs - super friendly locals! The trail crossed a road and then took me along a lake (Children’s Lake) right into town by the local ATC office and the post office. I took care of my business at the post office and went to a cafe down the street that a few hikers had recommended - Cafe 101.
I was feeling good! Despite the rain, I’d gotten 12 miles in by about 10:30 and I had time to eat a relax for a while. Cafe 101 was really awesome and I ate a lot of food! I started with huevos rancheros and coffee, then had stuffed French toast, and then an amazing churro sundae where the churros were made fresh. All incredible! I spent some time there just eating, drinking coffee, charging my phone and relaxing. Four or five locals came by to chat and to ask me about or wish me luck with my hike. Boiling Springs really left me with a fantastic impression! I felt disgusting and I was wet and dirty, but no one gave me the suspicious man stink eye!
Happy Feet had said she was also going to try to make Darlington Shelter, but I hadn’t seen her yet when I left Boiling Springs. I walked on and the trail really flattened out. I had known it would from the elevation profile in my AWOL guide, but I was mistaken thinking this part of the trail would be easy. Normally I think it would be, but we had so much rain that most of the stretch was just a giant mush pot of mud and overgrown pasture weeds. The mud and puddles made for very slippery and slow going. The overgrown weeds leaned over the trail, laden with water. So, as I sloshed and slipped through the mud, I plowed through weeds that then dumped water all over my legs and feet. My shoes and feet went from wet to saturated with water. Squish squash, squish squash! I would waddle along and every third step I would invent a new dance move that would put the moonwalk to shame. Trekking poles flailing and my legs jiving like Elvis, I walked along as best I could.
I never thought of PA as farmland. I always think of the industrial, Allentownish, factory working, Springsteen-blasting PA, but today all I saw was farmland. It was beautiful, despite the tough walking conditions. I smelled cows and earth. I watched bluebirds dart about in slim thickets of trees between pastures. I watched the rain fall lightly on a bird roosting on a phone wire overhead, his feathers fluffed to stay warm. I walked, and got wetter and wetter.
At one point when I only had 7 miles left, I had to stop. I sat down by a road and did a quick tick check. I was convinced that with all that grass brushing my legs I would have a million ticks, especially with my bug spray getting washed off with the rain on the weeds. No ticks though! I took off my shoes because I was starting to get hot spots in my arches from the sloshing. What I saw weren’t feet - they looked like misshapen brains. My feet had pruned up so badly it was pretty gross. No blisters though! I decided to sit there a bit and used my buff to towel off my feet. It was lightly raining, so this effort was only so effective. I sat for about 15 minutes deciding whether to change to my dry pair of socks. Usually I only wear my wet socks when it is raining, so I always have an emergency dry pair. I didn’t need them for warmth at night anymore, though, so I decided to do it. I would kick the wet sock can down the road. I took big pieces of moleskin and put those on my arches, and then put my dry socks on. It was heaven! And then I jammed them into my sopping wet shoes .... I didn’t use Leuko tape because I was trying to get moving quickly and it can take a little time to unwind off my roll. Plus, I only had 7 miles left. 
I hiked on and my feet felt better. I continued to slosh and push through weeds and the trail got so narrow and overgrown that I basically was looking at the thin strip of mud through a curtain of weeds. I plowed through it, accepting it’s generous gift of weed water into my shoes. At one point I made it to a boardwalk that went along a river and the trail got wider. I looked up and saw Kiki, the ridge runner who had given us pizza trail magic at Dahlgren campground. He and another guy were running at top speed on the trail. Running! I was sliding all over and these guys were just blazing along. He stopped to say hi and they continued on. Motivated, I picked up my pace, or tried to.
On the final climb to the shelter I crossed a creek and stopped to try and rinse mud out of my socks and sock liners. When I got to the shelter it was about 6:30/6:45. Fortunately there was still space! There was another NOBO there, Cody Coyote was there, and a section hiker and her dad, Echo and Hobbit. Hobbit has thru hiked multiple times and is doing another. I was beat! I got setup on the shelter floor and made my dinner. As I was eating, Happy Feet showed up around 8. Once again the kid proves she can crank out the miles! 
I fell asleep almost immediately when I laid down. It was a good day. I was grateful for the confidence to just be ok hiking wet, for the good people and good food of Boiling Springs, and for the sense to change my socks out to get to camp in one piece without blisters. Will this rain ever leave? Pennsylvania - the rainy state!Side note - the privy at the Darlington Shelter was actually called the Taj Mahal.

",Darlington Shelter,"May 16, Wed",26.30
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590852,"I woke up about 6. I slept like a rock, except that we all heard some kind of chewing on wood or grinding noise last night. It was the same noise I had heard at the Whiskey Hollow Shelter back in Virginia. Cody Coyote said he thought maybe it was a porcupine under the shelter, which is possible, but it really sounded like it was coming from the roof. I hope to solve this mystery at some point!
One of the flip floppers I met last night, Ibex, headed out of camp. She seemed pretty cool and said she was going to push to hike 22 miles today. Pretty awesome! Happy Feet and I both needed to resupply in Duncannon. I was already leaning towards staying there at the infamous Doyle Hotel, known for being a step below dive hotels. It was 25 bucks for a private room for the night, so the price was right! I decided to make a game time decision. 
I hiked out of camp and the walk in was nice. It was a little weedy at first, but then I climbed up and had some “normal” hiking with ups and downs and all that. I passed Ibex and got one view of Sherman’s Creek and the mountains shrouded in fog before descending to the road below. This whole ten miles it rained lightly, but it rained nonetheless. That rain turned to mist as I walked down the road into Duncannon. I got there at noon. I passed a gas station and went in to get a snack (Reese’s big break, or something like that, and a Monster energy drink - all healthy choices of course). Ibex showed up and I watched her pack while she went in, then we both walked the short stretch into the main part of town. She opted to stop at the first pizza place. I went to The Doyle to get some info. The guy there said they had a shuttle to the grocery store at 4 pm and private rooms for $25. It was tempting.... I decided to get some pizza and think it through. He then told me to go to the second pizza place, Sorrentos, because it was better. I looked back but Ibex was already inside the other joint. Too late to pass on the recommendation, but not too late for me! I got two slices of stuffed pizza, a Barq’s and chips. I did some charging and hung out for a bit. I knew that if I hiked out, I would only hike 5 miles to the first shelter anyway, so I decided I would stay. Also, there don’t seem to be a lot of convenient or interesting hostel options coming soon, so this was a good bird in the hand. 
Happy Feet caught up and came into the pizza place with Ibex. They got some food, then Ibex hiked out and Happy Feet came to the same conclusion to stay. We waddled over to The Doyle, got our rooms and then I went to the atm and down the street to do laundry. My room wasn’t bad. It’s basically a really rundown motel, but I sleep outdoors most nights so it seems pretty good to me! I got my laundry cleaned and dried just in time to catch the 4pm shuttle. Me, Happy Feet, and two Canadian Flip Floppers (Snickerdoodle and Chattacoochee) went to the market.  That chore was done in no time! I went back and had a great shower! I clipped my nails and scrubbed myself clean, or mostly clean. One of the trademarks of the Doyle is all the water damage. While I was taking a shower, water was dripping on my head from the shower running on the floor above me, with rotting exposed wood and plumbing overhead. But, the water pressure was good and, quite frankly, this was all and exactly what I needed! I was excited to get all of this for $25. I saw Bama Dog was staying here too and we chatted briefly. I organized my food supply and then went downstairs to eat. 
The Doyle serves food in its pub, and it was good! I got a burger and devoured it. I sat down with the Canadian Flip Floppers, some others I didn’t know, and Coach and Flip, who had shown up! Bama Dog later came down as well. After dinner, I grabbed a pint of ice cream from the small market right behind the Doyle.
It was a good and simple day. Yes, The Doyle is a wreck of a hotel, but I liked it! It’s perfect for a wet hiker to get some relief. The people there were really nice, including the owner Pat Kelly. His wife and business partner, Vickey, had just had surgery but he seemed to take it all in stride and was both friendly and helpful. Hungry Cat says, Do The Doyle! I was grateful for an oasis in the desert today, or maybe an island in the sea....","Darlington Shelter
",The Doyle Hotel in Duncannon,"May 17, Thu",10.90
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590936,"I woke up early at The Doyle with all the intentions of hiking a 29 mile day. There was a shelter 11 miles out of town, and then another 29 out. When I got up though, my intentions became less sincere. I went to breakfast at Goodies diner across the street. I almost skipped it to get hiking, but it’s hard for Hungry Cat to skip a meal.... I ordered a combo meal that had eggs, sausage, toast and pancakes. I didn’t realize the pancakes were going to be the size of flying saucers! They were covered with glorious butter as well. I had gorged myself yesterday with the food in Duncannon, so for the first time on the trail a meal got the better of me! I could not finish it all. I waddled out of breakfast and slapped my pack on. It was time to hike. 
The walk out of Duncannon does not follow the main commercial road that The Doyle is on. The AT follows one street back from The Doyle, which is actually residential. It was kind of nice being away from the traffic and walking through the neighborhood on the way out. The houses were relatively large and reminded me of other small town northeast neighborhoods  I’ve seen. Maybe it is the architectural style, or the signs of wear and tear from snow and harsh winters. There’s just kind of a “look” that characterizes these towns, sort of like the trademark craftsman homes in the south. One house actually had a big ceramic bear in the front yard! How ironic that the only bear I’ve seen on the trail has been ceramic and in someone’s yard in Duncannon....
I crossed the Juniata river heading out of town, and then the Susquehanna. They were both swollen and brown from all the rain. Shortly after that, the trail crossed railroad tracks and safely escorted me back into the woods. I hiked along and enjoyed the lack of both rain and heat! There was moisture in the air and it was quite humid, on the verge of raining, and so my weird child-man beard was collecting water droplets like leaves collect the morning dew. On the way up a hill I passed Bama Dog, who I had seen at breakfast. I actually got my first view in PA when I reached Table Rock, as opposed to the fog and mist I had been seeing since entering the state. 
I hiked on and the hiking was good solid ridge line terrain. I was grateful that I wasn’t slogging through wet muddy fields again! In fact, I made it to the shelter and everything on me, feet included, was still dry! It was only noon when I reached the shelter. I knew I could make the 18 miles to the next shelter, but also knew that it would be about 8pm by the time I got there. It was supposed to rain today and heavily tonight and tomorrow. The shelter I was at was huge and two stories. I was the first one there. The one 18 miles out was small and rated for 6 people, so at 8pm I’d likely be renting in the rain. I also factored in that I needed to get to Port Clinton on any day other than Sunday because I have a box at that post office. Therefore, I would need a shorter day at some point. So, two plus two equaled six and all the zodiac signs told me to stay, so I stayed. Finishing a hiking day at noon is weird. I spent a lot of time trying not to eat constantly. I chatted with some Flip Floppers, including a lady named Roaming Ambassador from London, and some folks I met in Duncannon (Sandals, Hobbit, Torque). I worked on this journal entry, rather than having to do it after dark!
Bama Dog must have decided to push on. Happy Feet stopped in briefly and pushed on. It made me feel a little wimpy, but hey - I won’t have to pack up a wet tent tomorrow, and I get to chill out a bit at camp. Woohoo!
I’m going to wrap up now and read some. I’m grateful for the time to slow down, and to still be dry. Tomorrow I fully expect to be soaked! That’s ok though - I’m relatively clean and dry now.

",Peters Mountain Shelter,"May 18, Fri",11.40
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591207,"I had a good sleep last night. I went to bed so early that I had to get up once at night to pee, and that was at 11:30! It was nice to relax and read before bed. I was toying with the idea of hiking a 31 mile day today to William Penn Shelter. The elevation gains and losses seemed minimal, and I figured I could just push through the rain. When I woke up though at 5am, it was raining steadily and quite windy, such that it sounded like it was pouring. I decided to go back to sleep for an hour and see if the rain might lighten up. It did indeed, but it had gotten quite chilly. It was probably about 50 degrees out with a bit of wind. Today was a great combination for hypothermia! Funny enough, I was just thinking I should mail my rain pants home as I haven’t used them in a very long time. Today, I used them. I also used my raincoat. Lately when it has rained it has been warm enough for me to just hike in shorts and a T-shirt. Today I had to revert to wearing rain gear again to stay warm. I wore my shorts and T-shirt underneath (no commando rain pants today!). 
It was a wet day. I’ll start with that. It rained and rained and the trail turned into a river. Even with these conditions, for a while I still thought I might hike the 31 miles to William Penn. But, then I got cold. The trail was easy hiking, so part of it was that there were no steep climbs where I could really get my blood pumping. I tried to move faster, but it’s hard to run through a trail river. At first I picked my way over rocks where I could to try and keep my feet from being water logged, but then I gave up. It was faster just to slosh through everything. I wished I could be like Moses and part the sea, but I could do nothing more than step into that cold mountain runoff. 
As I hiked I listened to machine gun fire. Last night we heard mortars or some kind of bombs going off in the distance. Today I could hear machine guns and distant voices. There was some kind of military base nearby, but at certain points in time I couldn’t help but wonder if all of their bullets were going away from the trail.... 
I splashed along and made it the 18 miles to the Rausch shelter by 1:45. I had time to go 13 more, but I was cold, didn’t want to get into camp late, and also didn’t want to push boundaries with wet feet. There were 3 flip floppers at the shelter, so there was room for me. I had a bird in the hand, so I took it! I got set up and into dry clothes and immediately felt better. The Flip Floppers were Itchy and Scratchy (a couple from Baltimore) and Steady, from Oklahoma. It was fun talking with them. Hobbit and Sandals showed up, as did Bama Dog. Happy Feet is somewhere ahead, probably at William Penn.
I went to hang my food bag and a lovely deer walked right in front of me. It didn’t hurry and just walked up the hill into the woods to forage. It was a great end to my hiking day. Now I would eat, journal, eat, and read! I was grateful for the hike today even though it was so wet, and grateful that I made a sensible decision instead of pushing on. As a result, I met some cool people and made my feet happy. Maybe it won’t rain as much tomorrow!","Peters Mountain Shelter
",Rausch Gap Shelter,"May 19, Sat",18
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591351,"I think Pennsylvania might be trying to kill me. Today was a long day full of surprises. Here’s how it went....
I got up at about 5:15. It was not raining - just dripping a little from wet trees. I went to get my food bag down and saw a tent behind the shelter. I later learned it was Ambassador, whom I had met at Peters Mountain Shelter. Folks started stirring in the shelter as we all quietly got ready. Hobbit and Bama Dog headed out first. I chatted a little with Itchy and Scratchy while I downed my two oatmeal packets and then headed on myself. I was on the trail by 6:30. 
The morning hiking was nice. The forest floor was wet from all of the rain and some spots were more saturated than others, but there were no lakes of water. My socks and shoes were wet from the day before, but at least I wasn’t making them more wet.  Rausch Gap was really pretty. The trail runs beside a creek that had a lively flow from all the rain. All around is a beautiful pine forest with cedars and other evergreens. There were some nice campsites by the creek - nice in drier weather anyway. When I woke up today I knew that I had options. There was a shelter called 511 Shelter that is right off of the PA 511 road that the trail crosses. It’s an enclosed shelter with a solar shower. That was 17 miles away. Or, there was the Eagles Nest 32 miles away. I had been thinking about trying to get a 30 mile day in at some point, just for kicks. I decided I would hike to 511 and see how I felt. That’s what I did.
The hiking was good. There were rocks, but they weren’t too bad. I crossed a bridge at Swatara state park and saw Hobbit there. I walked with him for a few minutes and we saw an old mineshaft in the side of the mountain. It was full of water. I hope the Goonies weren’t in there when it rained! We started a climb and I pulled ahead. Eventually I reached a stream crossing where a huge fallen tree was the bridge to get across. The water was so high it was almost to the top of the tree to where it could flow over. Fortunately, it was safe to pass. 
I saw a few deer and a very wet rabbit. I ran into a lot of locals as I got close to 511,  including a group of folks who asked me about the trail. One guy’s face almost fell off when I told him I’d walked from Georgia. He couldn’t wrap his mind around it. I think it’s interesting when people are on the Appalachian trail, actually walking on it, and don’t know that people hike it through.
As I climbed up the last hill to 511 it was getting hot, but I was feeling pretty good and it was only about 1:45. Nearing the road I saw a cooler. Usually when I find a cooler, all the drinks are already taken. This one was full! It had a nice trail magic sign signed by a guy named Chris and inside were water and Gatorade. I pounded down a blue Gatorade and climbed up to the parking lot at 511. As I did, I heard a voice: “did you get a drink?” The voice belonged to Chris, who was in the parking lot suiting up for a section hike to Port Clinton. We talked for a while and I thanked him profusely for the trail magic. Then, Chris said he recognized me from YouTube and asked if I knew Amanda Bess. I had no idea what he was talking about, but then I figured out that he was talking about thru hiker PeeWee, whom I had met in a Waynesboro and seen various places in the Shenandoahs. I had forgotten that she filmed me, Wallace, Whitewater, and Day Hiker at the Shenandoah lodge breakfast buffet. Chris has been watching her videos and recognized my face (more likely my hat). I will post a link to the video of her day 86 in my postscript comments. It’s all toilet humor, of course, since we hikers just really boil it down to the basics. 
I was feeling great after the Gatorade and felt like it was a sign, so I pushed on. Today would be the day for my “dirty thirty,” I just didn’t realize exactly how dirty. As I climbed away from PA 511, the rocks became less rock piles and more rock teeth - sharp, jagged points sticking out of the ground. It was like the mountains were trying to chew us up a little. The Appalachian mountain range is something like almost 500 million years old, and so it stands to reason that all that are left are sharp teeth in the ground.... several people who were coming southbound asked me if there was more water in the trail. Water? Why no! What were these people talking about? 
As I hiked the rocks got worse. Thank you mountains for the free foot massage, but let’s not get carried away with too much of a good thing. Then I started descending and, as I got lower, things got muddier. The mud was thick and slippery. And then came the real fun. The trail started to become a river. All of the creeks and springs of the mountain were full beyond the brim. They had to flow somewhere, and the trail was the path of least resistance. I picked my way through it by trying to hop on rocks at first. I did that for a while, often plunging my feet into pools that left them soaked anew. I then ran into two young guys who asked about the water situation. I told them it had gotten pretty wet and it was very muddy, but it would improve for them soon as they were hiking south. Their response was “great, because it’s bad for miles up ahead and the water was up to our calves at times!” Awesome....
Sure enough, after I passed them, the trail rivers turned into trail lakes that were connected by trail rivers. There was nothing to do but just trudge through it. They were also right in that the depth varied. Sometimes it was even with my toes, but mostly it was over my shoes and up to my ankles, with one or two calf-deep sections. I slogged on. I was a little worried at the combination of this much water and 30+ miles, but my feet felt like they were holding up. I’d be lying if I said they felt great. They felt waterlogged and pruny!
At one point during the slog fest I did see another scarlet tanager. I had only seen one other in the shenandoahs. I took a picture, but it kind of just looks like a large red speck because my zoom isn’t great. There were points in the hiking where I couldn’t tell if I was walking in a creek or on the trail, so I would just shuffle on and look for blazes.
At this juncture, I felt like I might not ever have dry feet again. Or maybe like my feet would rot off. Just when I thought things couldn’t get more “interesting,” I came to the last road crossing before the trail made the final push to Eagles Nest Shelter. I was tired and as I came into the meadow right before the road, I looked up and a raccoon was walking towards me. 
It is not unusual to surprise wildlife on the trail, but this was different. The raccoon made eye contact with me, and kept coming. It was walking funny and seemed a little off. I started to back up, and then it took a hard right turn into a clump of weeds and stopped. I wondered if it had a nest there, but it was a small raccoon and looked young itself. I fumbled for my phone because I wanted to shoot a video of it. As I did so, I heard it screeching and noticed it was running at me again, this time faster. I stopped the video and dashed to the side, raising my poles and yelling at it. It didn’t care. It was a ZOMBIE RACCOON! it turned with me and started again walking at me. It then kind of turned and fell sideways a bit, and then it got up and turned around and zombie walked off slowly, screaming. I’m pretty sure it had rabies given how it was like a disoriented honey badger. Fortunately, I couldn’t move fast enough to zombify Hungry Cat! I spent my entire childhood with my friend’s mom constantly warning us about rabid raccoons. “Carry a stick when you walk the dog, in case of rabid raccoons!” I always thought it was such a joke. After all this time, she was right! I did get a photo of the savage zombie beast staggering away. The video was just the sound of it screaming as I had to do a little run-dance to get away. Pennsylvania, are you trying to kill me? I think you are....
I hiked on wondering what could possible happen next. More lakes, more rocks, more mud, of course!
I finally got to the shelter at about 7:15pm, exhausted. Fortunately there was a shelter spot for me. Cody Coyote was there, as were two flip floppers, Shake and Bake, and Froggy. After getting my sleep kit setup since it was getting dark fast, I sat at the picnic table to make dinner. As I did, mice danced all around me and kept running across my feet, to the point where I finally pulled my feet up and off the ground. As I finished my meal, a mouse was literally eating next to me, just looking at me. They really could have cared less that I was there! 
Today, I’m just grateful to be alive and in one piece. I’m grateful to have had such an interesting day and experienced such unique things. I wonder what tomorrow will bring.... Tomorrow I will go into Port Clinton and Hamburg.

",Eagles Nest Shelter,"May 20, Sun",32.60
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591492,"I woke up this morning and noticed that my legs and feet didn’t really feel any worse than a typical morning, which was great. I wasn’t sure how I would feel after the higher-than-usual mileage yesterday. The mice didn’t seem to be active in the shelter last night, which was great considering how rambunctious they were by the picnic table last night (which was right next to the shelter). It was a misty morning, but it was supposed to be clear all day until night, at which point it would rain. Again. And into tomorrow. But for now it was clear, and that’s all I cared about!
I hiked out of camp. Cody Coyote had vanished and flip floppers Shake and Bake and Froggy were still at the shelter. I had two missions today: pick up my shoes that I had been bouncing north at the post office in Port Clinton, and resupply in neighboring Hamburg. I had no real mileage goal for the day, but I did want to try and avoid getting sucked into staying in Hamburg and spending money on the Microtel there. I had one other task in mind, which was applying a permethrin treatment to my new shoes. Permethrin is a key part of my tick defense and shoes are an obvious risk for getting ticks, perhaps one of the most likely entry paths. I had a bottle of permethrin coming along with the shoes so that I could treat them before wearing them.
As I walked along I startled a deer that was lying down in a sunny little glen in the woods. It got up and bounded off. I am sure that deer was as happy to see the first rays of morning sun as I was. Shortly after, two young men passed me hiking southbound. They must have been brothers and possibly twins. They both had amazing bowl cuts that reminded me of hair styles from my childhood, and the shorter of the two wore suspenders. They were excited about the break in the rain as well and looked to be out just for the day (no packs). I enjoyed the miles into town. The descent into Port Clinton offered no switchbacks and was virtually straight down. Maybe this was good practice for the Whites! The trail dropped down to a railroad station, which was next to the Schuylkill River. I crossed a bridge over the river and walked up the Main Street to the post office. The post office there does not open until 12:30, which was in about 15 minutes, so I decided to use the time to eat a snack and dry out my feet. Two other hikers were there waiting, a flip flopper Cool and his section hiker friend Cats (together, the Cool Cats). I took off my shoes and socks and gaiters and lay them in the sun. I stretched my feet into the sun as well to de-prune a little. I’m sure I looked like quite the hobo at the post office, though I’m also quite sure they are used to it. When it opened, I got my package and opened it outside. Shoes glorious shoes!!! I took them and my clean pair of socks over to the parking lot and applied the permethrin, then left them there to dry in the sun. I put my now almost dry socks on and almost dry old shoes on and organized my pack. I had also lain out my rain gear so I had to stuff that back in. I took my new shoes and put them in the back of my pack in the mesh pocket, and safety pinned (thanks Chris!!) my permethrined socks to the back of my pack to finish drying. I was like a walking clothesline! 
In general, Port Clinton was kind of a dead trail town. I feel like they are missing a lot of opportunity there. Apparently there is a barber shop that gives hikers free cookies and has musical instruments to play. I kind of wanted to go there, but that’s also just kind of awkward, and I needed to get to Hamburg. I walked east to where the trail exits town. The sun was hot and felt good. I walked along the river and under the highway 61 bridge. I needed to walk along this road to get to the Walmart in Hamburg, but when I saw how busy it was I decided to try and hitch a ride. I doubled back to Port Clinton and went up past the post office to where that road hit the highway. I am not sure if hitchhiking is illegal in PA, but I always assume it is, so I kept watch for the staties as I stuck my thumb out. After about 10 minutes, a guy in a pickup truck pulled up and asked if I was just trying to get to Walmart. I said yes and he motioned for me to hop in, so I threw my pack and sticks in the truck bed and jumped in. His name was Rocco. He was pretty quiet but asked how long I’d been on the trail and a few questions like that. I was super grateful for the ride as it saved me a lot of time and a walk along a very busy road. I thanked him profusely and hopped out at Walmart. 
I love walking through the store pushing a cart with my pack and sticks! I don’t mind sticking out like a sore thumb. There is something liberating about it, like skinny dipping. I think it’s the fact that I know I look unusual and I don’t care - I don’t even think about it, not even when I am trying to sort my food on the ground outside of the store. I got all of my resupply items, as well as a smoothie and a Monster energy drink and the. Sidled up to the Subway inside Walmart. I ordered a foot long and the guy asked if it was for here or to go. I told him for here, and he said he would give me a bag anyway just in case I couldn’t finish it. Ha! I told him thank you, but there was zero chance of that! As I ate the sandwich, two people approached and asked me about the trail. One was a flip flopper named Phariel (something like that) and the other was a trail angel who had given him a ride there. After chatting with them, I washed my hands in the bathroom and pushed my cart into the entrance area. In Walmarts I like to break down my resupply by the motorized cart charging area. They get used a lot at Walmart, and so there are almost always empty plugs. I charge my phone and battery pack there and sit in the ground and take my food out of its boxes. I did this today. I’m sure some people are freaked out, but I don’t even notice - I’m in my own world. 
After getting my food out of the packaging, i took my old shoes and gave them a rather crude burial in a Walmart trash can. I wished there was a hiker box to put them in just in case, but honestly it’s better that no one try and use them. I really destroyed them, and they smelled horribly. I walked down towards the highway in my new shoes and could immediately notice how much better they felt! There was a WaWa at the intersection and I decided to grab a Reese’s big cup. Why not? After that I walked down to the road. The intersection was a congested mess and not a good place to hitch, so I walked the mile and change back to the trail. At the trailhead someone had put a little painted rock that said “If it went perfect, it wouldn’t be an adventure.” So true! I loved this - it’s a good reminder for me at any point in time really. I’m out here to adventure! I had just enough time to make it to the first shelter out of town. Froggy and Shake and Bake were there, as well as the Cool Cats. Cody Coyote came as well, but then later decided to keep walking. There was a big group of people camped near the shelter with some kind of flag. Later at night I heard some kind of weird incantation-like singing.  I was grateful for a dry day and to be in new shoes, and to have space at the shelter since it would rain that night. 
Postscript: 
#1 - Edwin, I definitely prefer my tent over shelters. I’d much rather have the privacy and mouse-free comfort of my tent. But, when it’s wet, packing up a wet tent isn’t ideal, and if it’s wet multiple days in a row, water gets inside and everything in the tent is kind of in this perpetual moist state. So, unless I know i can dry it out the next day, I might opt for a shelter. Shelters are also convenient as there is less to set up. I can get out quicker in the mornings. There are many downsides to shelters though - other people, snoring, mice, porcupines, and generally needing to be more cognizant of other people. I think I had a past entry on nightly routine. I’ve talked a bit about gear along the way as well. Maybe I’ll address it more later, but right now my gear is at a steady state since I wrote about changing my pack out in Pearisburg. I love the new pack and the sleeping pad!  Thanks for reading!","Eagles Nest Shelter

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591506,"I woke to the expected rain. It got heavier as we all ate breakfast. I looked at my options for the day. 9 miles away there was a bunkhouse Shelter with a solar shower, but it was a cold shower so I decided not to get sidetracked and stop there. I decided to hike to the Allentown Hiking Club Shelter and then reevaluate. PA has some strangely spaced shelters. I either had to walk 16.5 miles or 26 miles. That said, by the time I reached the Allentown shelter 16.5 was more than enough!
A quick side note as I have mentioned snoring before. I will not name names here, but last night was the second occasion on hearing a particular individual snore. The first time I was actually afraid this person was having a breathing problem. Having lived through that night, last night I was able to relax and listen to the snoring with incredulity. So far, this person takes the cake. I have never heard anything like this level of complexity or duration before. It lasted all night long, both times! Imagine there is a sport called Olympic breath holding. Imagine then that the athlete who competes in this sport has to train, and to do so he must hold his breath as long as possible, then gasp to breathe again when he cannot possibly hold it another second without passing out. Imagine that deep gasping noise. Hold that thought. Now, try to picture a bored dog. A big old dog. It is lying in the sun. It lifts its head out of boredom and looks for second, sees. I thing because there is nothing, and then exhale-snorts out of its nose as it puts its head back down, licking its drooly jowls twice. Hold that snorty sound too. Lastly, imagine someone being tortured to death and so weak that he can just barely utter a kind of pathetic, long whimpering sound. Or, maybe it is the sound of hopes and dreams being crushed. It’s hard to describe, but it sounds sad and final. Now start with that, do a couple of those, then add the sudden gasp for air. Alternate the gasp for air with the dog snort and that’s basically what I was hearing. It was incredible. Anyway, I just wanted to mention that. 
I hiked out and the rain came. I made the decision to take off my rain jacket because I got hot, and then it really started pouring so I got completely soaked and cold. I was just warm enough if I hiked fast. I passed Cody Coyote and then hit the gnarly rocks. They were tough, slow going. The 16.5 miles seemed to take forever. When I finally got to the shelter, two other hikers were there. I had to get out of wet clothes quickly to get warm. I felt better once I did, and could then focus on eating something. One of the hikers was the guy I’d met at Walmart yesterday, Phariel. He’s an older gentleman who is flip flopping. The other guy had just stopped to get warm and headed on. Later, two brothers showed up, as did another flip flopper. As we were sitting there, a man showed up. He definitely seemed kind of rough and out of place. He was wearing pants and a sweatshirt and carrying a small daypack. I realized I had passed him walking South on the trail. He asked if there were “a lot of these things (shelters)” on the trail. He then asked when the next one was, and also how far it was to walk to Allentown. There was definitely something out of place. He then asked if he could stay in the shelter, so we said sure, of course. He climbed in and sat there with his pack for a while, and after about 20 minutes he quietly got up and left. He really did not seem to know where he was. The young brothers looked relieved that he was not sleeping next to them! He had a pretty large and muscular build. We all wondered - who walks around in the woods getting soaked and doesn’t seem concerned about not knowing where they are? Our stranger friend, apparently. I couldn’t help but wonder if he was running from someone or something.... Probably not, but you never know on the trail!
I was grateful to have a dry place to sleep tonight! The hiking left me tired. I will not miss the PA rocks! Tomorrow is supposed to be quite nice weather, and I am looking forward to that!","Windsor Furnace Shelter

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591637,"It rained quite a bit last night. I woke at 5 and it was foggy and drippy out, but the rain had stopped. I got ready early and I’m glad I did because it was a challenging hiking day. My clothes were still wet from yesterday, so while I threw my wet shorts on, I waited until the last possible minute to put my wet socks and shoes on, and then my wet T-shirt. It was a little chilly, so I threw on my rain jacket (yep - also wet) and headed out at a brisk pace to get warm. It was supposed to be warm and sunny today, but the remains of the wet front still needed a few hours to pass through. I wanted to walk about 20-22 miles today. It would be a good day for walking, and a great night to tent without a rainfly!
The first named view today was Knife’s Edge. This was a challenging rock scramble along a ridge line, hence the name. The view was nice and the feature itself just looked cool - it is very aptly named! When I was on Knife’s Edge it felt like a storm was blowing in as the wind picked up and I saw dark clouds forming, but it all dissipated as the morning started to clear. I stopped at Bake Oven Knob to check out the view and learned why I’ve seen so many “no graffiti” signs on the trail. The rocks had a lot of graffiti on them, unfortunately. The views were great though. I saw a flip flopper from the shelter last night, Treefall, having a snack there. 
I stopped at Bake Oven Knob Shelter to have some lunch and dry my feet out a bit. I met a southbounder named Moses there and we chatted a bit. He had just hiked the Israel national trail so we talked about that. The Bake Oven Knob Shelter was old - an original AT shelter built back in the 30s (I think - someone told me this). My next stop, George W. Outerbridge Shelter, was as well. I stopped there because it had the last water source for about 17 miles. I had walked 16 miles but I wanted to keep going. My plan was to load up on water here, then descend to the road crossing for Palmerton and do the climb out to a tent site. That would land me in the dry stretch and I could finish it up tomorrow. 
I got water from the spring, drank a liter and a half, and also boiled water for my dinner, a rice side. I put the rice side in my cook pouch to cook as I walked. This way, I wouldn’t use any of my water supply for cooking, and I would have dinner ready when I got to camp!
Walking with 4 liters of water was definitely slower going. I walked down to the busy Palmerton road and then started the climb out. It was hot out still, but it felt good as there was a slight breeze. What I didn’t realize though was that this was a serious climb! As in rock climbing...or more like bouldering. The trail essentially went straight up, and at many points I had to hoist myself up rocks after making technical advances upwards. It was difficult with the bulk of my pack. I broke down my trekking poles so they would fit on the side of my bag - they were just a liability when I needed both hands to climb. I tried not to look down as I searched for hand and foot holds to hoist myself up. One particular spot took me about 15 minutes to figure out how I would go up, and then to get up the nerve to make the move. My heart was pounding in my chest, but I made it! A fall here would be very, very bad. I was so grateful to make it up this crazy climb! I have a moderate fear of heights, partially driven by a rock climbing incident when I was 17 or 18. It felt like I had overcome my fears when I needed to. The trail had given me the strength to carry on!
The mountain around Palmerton has been heavily mined for zinc. The mining activity is quite obvious - the whole mountain has been carved up with dynamite. I could see the huge mining operation in Palmerton from the ridge line. Part of the reason there is no water on this stretch is that there are a few springs, but the guides say not to drink from them. Why? Because the water quality is spoiled by the mining activity. It’s quite sad! I couldn’t help but think back to Pearisburg where it was quite clear the chemical plant owned that town. I suspect the mine owns Palmerton as well. It’s so sad to see our natural resources, quality of life, and the health of our natural environment destroyed by greed. If I ever went to Palmerton I wouldn’t drink the water there. It’s sad, but we can’t trust that local governments and organizations truly are looking out for us. Sigh.... What a Potemkin village we all live in! 
After the big climb I pushed on to a tent site. Today the hiking was really hard in places (knifes Edge, other very rocky outcrops, the Palmerton climb), and easy in others. Pennsylvania continues to surprise and challenge, always getting creative with its rocks! I was grateful today for awesome weather, a cool breeze, and to make it up the big climb, both alive and despite my fears. Today is Whitewater’s last day on the trail - her time has come to go back to Canada! I wish she were still hiking, but happy I got the chance to meet her and hike with her a bit. She, Wallace, and Day Hiker are back in Port Clinton. Maybe I will see those guys again soon if they pick up the pace! Happy Feet is somewhere behind me as well. I just keep walking north....","Allentown Hiking Club Shelter

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592096,"Ok.... I have been hiking a lot of miles and got behind with my diary here, so I am going to do some short hand for a change for a few days of entries just to get caught up. It’s hard to hike longer days and have the time and energy to write long form, how I’d like. I want to, but then I fall asleep or have to think about logistics and then I’m too tired. The hotter weather has made me more tired at night... Also, at the shelters after dark I try not to type on my phone unless I can hide in my sleeping bag and do it so that No one sees the glare, but that is hard now because I usually don’t get inside my 20 degree toasty bag until it gets chilly in the middle of the night. Anyway, here’s the recap for today. 
I got on the trail early wanting to make it to the last shelter before Delaware Water Gap. It was going to be a day with long stops between water sources. I hiked through a road gap and right behind the Appalachian Trail sign was a county sign that said “Carbon County.” Like I mentioned yesterday, it’s clear who owns this town. I saw a nice wild turkey shortly after this.
Today I met some cool hikers. First I met Rest Step and Simba and would see them a few times during the day. Simba had read my trail journal, so that was cool! We all ended up at the same shelter mid-day because it was the first water source in a while - Leroy A. Smith Shelter. There I met a NOBO named Speedy who started April 1! Later in the day as I got close to Wind Gap I met Willow, a flip flopper and she mentioned she had been hiking with Sugar Foot (I believe that is the right trail name), who is Ken who has signed my journal guest book! I was excited by this, but I did not catch up to Ken yet (and may not!). On the way into the last shelter, Kirkridge, I passed flip floppers Late Start and French Roast. I figured I would get to talk with these folks at the shelter, but when I got there the tent sites were pretty full. It was a nice night and I didn’t want to tent all crammed together, so I got water and kept walking. I walked another two miles and started to get worried about finding a spot, and just before dark I found a clearing and sort of ghetto camped on a road bed there. I enjoyed watching the rabbits come close to me in the dark out of curiosity. 
I was grateful today for meeting such great people and the strength to hike a big day in hot weather!

#1 - I did figure out what that shelter scraping noise was after all. Porcupines! They chew on the treated shelter wood for the salt content, apparently, which explains why it was at night. PA has a lot of porcupines!
#2 - someone told me a funny story (I think it was Itchy and Scratchy) about a hiker who slept in his tent during the PA rains and a skunk decided to take cover and sleep under his tent rain fly in the vestibule. So, he was basically afraid to move or get out of the tent until the skunk finally left, worried of course that it would be startled and spray him. Crazy!","Tentsite at Mile 1263.2

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592097,"I got up early to get into Delaware Water Gap with time to run errands, look around, and hike out. On the hike in, a porcupine sauntered right across the trail in front of me! I took a video, albeit not a great one: https://youtu.be/_LC1PxjfgHY. It was cool seeing the Delaware river for the first time from the trail. I saw three deer in the way in as well. I love getting started on the trail early!
Delaware Water Gap was smaller than I expected. I had a good time there running into hikers I hadn’t seen for a while! Traveler, Ben and Rose, Clothesline, Cheddar, and I met Honey and Moon and a guy named Moose, all NOBOs. I ate richly at the Apple Pie Cafe and resupplied poorly at a gas station there. I bought a bunch of milk chocolate candy bars that would just be melted for a few days. There is a donation-based church hostel in town that has free showers, so I took a shower before hiking out. It was great! They had a guitar there too. I hadn’t played in a long time, so I picked the strings a bit before leaving.
I crossed the Delaware in a style not like George Washington at all - I walked across the bridge as it shook and swayed from the cars traversing it. It was a hot day and I stopped at the Park station to feb a Gatorade before hiking across the road and back into the woods. Later PA!
I didn’t hike that far as I had burned through a lot of time in town. The hike out of DWG was along a beautiful trout stream at first, then climbed further up into a ridge. I found a campsite with a lovely view. Water was going to be weird - the water spots are more scarce here in terms of springs, so I had to pack out water from a really off-color brackish creek. It’s fine to drink once filtered, but the water retains a brown tint. Not my fave, but water is water! I sat, looked at my pretty view, called my wife to chat and ate. I also found a pinhole leak in my CNOC water collection bag. I think it’s a manufacturing defect so I emailed them about it. 
I was grateful to see old faces anew today, and for the good discussion and social time in DWG. I was also grateful to see a porcupine - how awesome!","Stealth Campsite at mile 1290.4

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592099,"Today was super hot. I did a lot of hiking on ridge lines with views. There were a lot of people out for the holiday weekend. I climbed up a fire tower called Catfish Tower and from the top I looked down and Happy Feet was there! She had caught up and was, and had been, hiking with a guy named Dude. I climbed down and said hello and she gave Uncle Cat (that’s what she calls me) two fig newtons. It was good to see a friendly face! I was struggling to make miles in the heat, and my feet had been aching since the PA rocks had their way with me.
I stopped for the day at Gren Anderson Shelter. It had been a day of flies, gnats, mosquitos and heat, but also of pretty views, ponds, bullfrogs and good hiking. I almost peed on a black snake at one point, not seeing it in the grass in front of me .... It was supposed to start raining early in the morning so I slept in the shelter to try and avoid packing a wet tent in the rain in the morning. I met a NOBO named Ulysses who had started the day before me! It’s cool to meet NOBOs now so late in the game. Dude and Happy Feet stopped here too. 
I was grateful to have a good day of hiking and to have some camaraderie at camp. It’s a good morale booster! My feet were pretty achy today. Hopefully they will feel better soon.","Campsite at mile 1303.2

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592100,"I didn’t sleep well at the shelter last night. It was hot and the guy next to me snored. I still got up at 5 though to get going. It hadn’t started raining yet so I hustled out of camp to get some miles in before the rain. I made it about 5.5 to the first shelter and sat down to have a snack and look at logistics. It had rained during the hike, but let up when I got to the shelter. I was planning on going to Unionville today or tomorrow, and then maybe Warwick in a few days to get laundry done and clean up. But, I found another option: a hostel called Mosey’s Place that would pick me up from the High Point State Park headquarters (the hostel is in Port Jervis, NJ). 30 bucks for a bunk in a house, laundry, shuttle to food/resupply options, and breakfast! It was a great deal and had really good reviews, so I called the owner, Mosey, and arranged a pickup. It would be sooooo good to clean up a bit.
The park HQ was cook and gives each thru hiker a free soda. At the park, Happy Feet and Dude decided they wanted to come too. We all got picked up and Mosey took us for food on the way home. I got Subway and Dunkin Donuts! There were three other NOBOs at the hostel who I hadn’t met - Hot Sauce, and I’m drawing a blank on the others’ names. I did laundry, resupplied, re-permethrined some clothing, ate, etc etc. it was great! Tomorrow I will hike out after breakfast!
I felt like my feet needed a rest today. I was grateful for such an amazing and economical option. It’s good to be clean again!  Tomorrow I think the rain will clear up. Also, I saw Apollo and Skutch again here briefly. They had stayed here and caught a train to visit family, but were just back and hitting the trail tonight.

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592215,"I woke up in my nice comfy bunk at Mosey’s this morning at 5:30, and then snoozed until quarter till. I could hear Mosey in the kitchen making breakfast. I could smell it too! I got up, grabbed a cup of coffee, and then chatted with Mosey while I ate pancakes, eggs and bacon. It was awesome! It is seriously worth staying there. Mosey makes everything easy and convenient, and she is full of trail knowledge and good stories. She told me some pretty hilarious stories about her years working in the postal service too. One was about how she wore a shirt or something to work about “going postal” and they made her take it off - something like that. Mosey was taking us back to the trail in two waves. First she would take Dude, Happy Feet, and me back. As we were eating, we heard these crazy, loud, and annoying bird noises from outside. Apparently her neighbor has game hens of some type. They were super loud, and as Mosey put it, “they’ll talk over you.” 
We got back on the trail somewhere around 8:30. I fell back and hiked my own pace. The rain yesterday had cooled things down nicely. It was a beautiful morning for hiking! It was cloudy but not supposed to rain. I hiked along and eventually heard voices behind me. It was Traveler, Candyman, Honey, Moon and a guy whose trail name I keep forgetting. They passed on and eventually walked into Unionville. I ran into Sugarfoot right before the road to Unionville. He was farther in front of me than I originally thought!  We made introductions and talked for a bit, and then he went into Unionville with the rest of the crew. I hiked on alone, enjoying the weather and the day. 
I passed through the WallKill National Wildlife refuge, which was very flat trail and an awesome section of wetlands. I saw cranes and redwinged blackbirds and rabbits there, as well as other birds. I later walked along the Pochuck Boardwalk. There was quite a bit of boardwalk today, over marsh/wetland areas. It was a very cool new addition to the scenery. The Pochuck Boardwalk was a very long section (several miles I think) and it was a very nicely constructed, tourist boardwalk. There were tons of day hikers and tourists there. The boardwalk weaves through the wetlands. Despite the people traffic, I really enjoyed this section. 
After the boardwalk I climbed up towards a popular local viewpoint. On the way up I stopped at a spring to filter water. I had run into Dude earlier and we decided we would probably pack water from this spring and look for s place to camp. A lady coming down the hill asked me if I had seen the baby bear. What?! I told her no, but that i wished I had. Dude showed up at the spring and then we continued north. We ran into two ladies who told us they had just seen a bear about 5 minutes prior. Dude has not seen a bear yet either, so he and I snapped to attention and immediately tried to hurry down the trail quietly to see this bear. I thought for sure we would see it! We didn’t. We did find a stealth campsite though. As we set up, Happy Feet walked into camp and asked “did you see the bear???” ARRRRRGGGHHHHH! She had a picture of it. Dude and I couldn’t believe it - how had we missed it? Even the loud day hikers saw bears today....
It was a good and long day! I really enjoyed the hiking and scenery today. Tomorrow I will leave NJ and enter NY. I was grateful for the beautiful cool weather, the amazing wildlife, the easier terrain, and good hiker company today. Tomorrow will be fun!

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592307,"Today was pretty amazing. It’s hard to know where to start, so let me begin in the middle. You know, the logical place to start. By noon I had walked just shy of 13 miles and I was napping on the ground just outside of Bellvale Farm Creamery. It was hot out and I needed a rest. I had a full belly from the hot dog stand just down the street off the trail, and the ice cream I had eaten inside. Choo Choo and I had hiked off the trail together to the hotdog stand, but there wasn’t any shade there and the creamery had a water spigot. I was out of water and we both needed it, so we decided to do things in reverse and eat ice cream and come back for hot dogs. The creamery was awesome! It had a nice view and a pavilion in the shade with a picnic table. It had a hiker phone charging station, and a water spigot with cold potable water. And man, did it have ice cream! I got a banana split and it was huge. I got two scoops of a flavor called The Great White Way (white chocolate with dark chocolate chunks and raspberry sauce) and a scoop of cookie dough, and topped it with hot fudge, edible cookie dough, whipped cream, cherries, and gummy bears. It was so good my eyes rolled around in my head like marbles loose on the floor. I wanted more ice cream, but we still had to hit the hot dog stand, so we walked there and got the special - two dogs, a bag of chips, and a soda for $5.50. I got kraut on one dog and cheese on the other. We carried them back to the creamery and I destroyed mine pretty quickly. By the time I got to the chips, I was pretty full and getting sleepy. I managed to finish the chips, but I needed a nap and the pavilion was so clean and inviting. By then, Dude was there and Choo Choo was shipping out, so I decided to nap. Meanwhile, tourists from New York were walking into the shop and doing their thing. We must have been quite the sight, the Dude sitting by his pack and me asleep on the ground, our shoes off.... The Creamery is amazing though - so hiker friendly! When I woke up from my nap, I realized I didn’t have room for more ice cream. It was close to 90 degrees out and I didn’t want to ralph on the trail, so instead I got a birch beer. I’m a big root beer fan these days and I had been wanting to try birch beer. I was glad I did, but I will probably stick with root beer in the future. I handled some logistics with CNOC to have them mail me a new water reservoir. Mine developed a pinhole leak in NJ and CNOC was awesome and agreed to mail me a new one. I absolutely love that product so I was excited about their excellent customer service. I realized I had been at the creamery for a little over 3 hours!!! I don’t know how long I slept, but I needed to get hiking. I was about to have another exciting trail “first,” on the heels of one I had this morning, which I commemorated by adding gummy bears to my banana split....
I woke up early this morning because I wanted to get some miles in. I wanted to hike a lot before it got blazing hot, I wanted to try to get to a hot dog stand and creamery off the trail by about noon, and I wanted to hike between 20 and 23 miles. I accomplished the first two goals. I quietly packed up my gear and headed out of camp after eating. I was hiking at 6:18am. After about 2.5 miles I stopped at the Wawayanda shelter, the last one in New Jersey, to use the privy. The New Jersey privies have been the absolute best on the trail. They are clean and have hand sanitizer. I had to get one last use.... When I exited, who was leaving the shelter  and coming towards me but Choo Choo! I hadn’t seen him since Damascus, when Gillian sent him on his way with a bag of her homemade cookies. We chatted for a bit to catch up and then I organized my things while he went to the ranger station to get some water. 
I hiked on down past the ranger station and across the road. Even Choo Choo told me he saw that big bear yesterday. EVERYONE ELSE SAW IT!!! Except Dude and I. I started walking up a small hill, and when I came over the other side I saw and heard motion. I looked up and there it was. Finally! A BEAR! It immediately took off and ran down the hill from me, but I got to watch it run for a few seconds. It was quite fast, like a dog. It was a smaller sized bear. Apparently it didn’t want to stick around and cuddle, so I guess it wasn’t the teddy variety. It will probably be exiled by the other bears for letting me see it. I was so excited! A bear on the trail! I do hope I see more, but if not at least that box is checked. 
I left New Jersey with a spring in my step and hit the New York State line. I really liked the trail in New Jersey. I loved the different scenery with the wetlands and bogs. There was a lot of great wildlife as well, including BEARS! As I entered New York, I did so on a rocky ridge line with great views, and passed over Prospect Rock, the highest point on the AT in New York. Spoiler alert - it’s not that high at 1400 feet or so.... 
New York starts off with a bang! The hiking was technical, traversing a large stretch of rocky ridge line with some use of hands to pull oneself up rocks, and some minor bouldering required. I loved it! We finally had some technical climbs again, and it really felt like hiking - struggling to get to the reward of views. I could see Greenwood Lake, and the weather, while hot, was clear and sunny for the views. 
Choo Choo caught up and during this stretch of trail we hiked separately, but sometimes together at points. I then pulled away and, on my way down towards the road crossing for the creamery, I met a couple who told me I should get a flavor called The Great White Way there. As I type this I’m dying for a waffle cone to shove in my face! Choo Choo caught up to me as I hit the road crossing and we walked in together.
Fast forward through the creamery events and my nap, while I had hiked just under 13 miles by noon, it was now almost 3:30 and I needed to get moving. I knew I wouldn’t make a 20 mile day, so I decided to hike to Fitzgerald Falls 4 miles away and see how I was feeling. I lathered yo with sunscreen and headed out into the blazing afternoon sun.
After about a quarter mile of hiking, I heard and saw something to my right. A snake! At first I thought it was cooking up to strike at something. I then realized I was right, and that something was me! I also realized that it was shaking its rattle trying to get me to leave. A RATTLESNAKE!! I had been kind of wanting to see one, but more just wanting someone else to show one to me.... This fellow was one agitated snake. He kept shaking that rattle, watching me and coiling back to strike. I started to get my camera out and walk around to get a photo, but he did not like that at all and starting darting his head back like he was going to strike, so I backed away and moved on. I have heard that they can strike prey as far away as 3x their body length. I wasn’t going to risk that! It was a very cool experience though! 
A bear AND a snake! How could this day get any better? How about a camp site at a waterfall? I ended up camping st beautiful Fitzgerald falls. I had a water source there and it was quite pretty. This gave me time to relax and soak my feet in the creek there, which I did. So, today was basically awesome! I’m excited to be in New York and blown away by my luck today. The trail provides, yet again! I’m grateful for all of these things, and most grateful that I will wake up and hike again tomorrow.","Stealth Campsite at Mile 1360.2

The day was cloudy in the morning, but cleared up later. I was first out of camp and got into the hiking quickly. I’m really liking the New York scenery so far. There are lots of ups and downs over rocks, and plenty of rock scrambles and complicated climb ups and turns to keep it really interesting. I crossed over I87 and the crazy rush and noise of the cars was intense. I thought about how the trail always leads me to the sanctuary of the woods, even if sometimes it passes through some rough patches. It’s such a metaphor for the spiritual journey of life. After the highway, I passed into Elk Park and climbed up into some wonderful scenery. I was fortunate to get a breeze here that would stay the rest of the day. It really helped with the bugs and gnats.
About the gnats....They are the most dogmatic and persistent things. I wonder if gnats just view my body as one large restaurant. So they try and call for reservations? “Hello, this is Gnathaniel, so you have space for two to dine tonight? Yes, two - I’ll be bringing my wife Nit. Also, do you have any corner eye seats? We love the corner.... If we can’t get in there, do you by chance have VIP under kid seating?” Whether they are that organized or not, they sure do love eating me.
I walked through a cool section of trail today called the Lemon Squeezer. There is a triangular window of rock that you walk under, and then a tight corridor to walk through and up. I got a little stuck in the corridor and had to take my pack off and throw it up onto the rocks and squeeze through without it. After that, there was some hand-over-hand bouldering. It was a good challenge and fun! I also passed the intersection with the New York Long Path trail today. It apparently runs into NYC after about 53 mikes. Dude is actually walking that trail to meet his siblings in New York for his birthday. I think that is pretty awesome! I was tempted to walk it myself, just so I could say that I walked out of the woods and into Manhattan, but I have my eye on the prize.
It was a long day and I ate a lot of snacks. I decided to stay at West Mountain Shelter, but I actually wanted to tent at the shelter turn off or a little past because the shelter itself is half a mile off trail, and has no privy and water that is another .3 miles from the shelter. The shelter trail was on a ridge, so I headed in to find the first possible camp site. I met No Excuse on the way in. I have seen him in the log books.  He’s also a NOBO and hikes with guys named Chimney and Big Push. I’m finally meeting some of the faster guys who left at the same time I did. I stopped to set up my tent and as I pulled out my tent poles, I heard the rope inside snap. Ugh! I ended up getting a shelter spot, but I will need to get some new poles ASAP. I plan to deal with that tomorrow. I can probably use duct tape in the meantime, but it’s not ideal and there is some stormy weather coming.
I was grateful for the wonderful views today, the incredible hiking, and to be by a shelter when my tent poles broke. Tomorrow I should cross the Hudson!","Stealth Campsite at Fitzgerald Falls

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592530,"Today was a day of logistics and adulting. I woke up at 5 wanting to walk about 20 miles, but knowing I wouldn’t. I needed to resupply and I knew I would do that, and eat a bunch of food, at the Appalachian Market right off the trail on route 9. I also needed to get squared away with new tent poles somehow. Here’s how it all went....
I hiked out early and, while it was supposed to rain, fortunately it hadn’t started yet. I hiked back up the 0.5 mile rocky side trail from the shelter and over the ridge, descending down to the road where I would climb Bear Mountain. There were some nice views from the ridge of the Hudson and a distant pond on the other side of the mountain. 
The climb up Bear Mountain was “sculpted.” It was definitely not the more naturally rugged terrain typical of the trail. It started out as a road and then moved to largely smooth path. It was a trail for the masses. On the climb up I didn’t see that many people though. At the top of the mountain I got lured in by a building with a Pringles vending machine and a trash bin. I emptied out all of my trash and bought some sour cream and onion Pringles. A police officer drove by as I was stuffing the Pringles into my mouth, crumbs stuck in my beard. I could definitely see someone calling the cops on me at this stage, but it was just a normal patrol. I went over to the tower at Bear Mountain summit and climbed to the top. There was a stone tower to summit, and inside there were lots of informational plaques on the area, the bridge, etc. 
I climbed down and decided to hike on and try and find a decent cell signal. I needed to call REI about my tent poles. On my way down the road back to the AT, I heard someone say “hey hiker trash!” It was a group of Americorps workers who were there to do trail maintenance. They were hikers too and one had previously thru hiked the AT. She gave me a bag of chips and the guy gave me a banana. It was so nice of them! In case you’re wondering, “hiker trash” is not an insult. It’s basically just the hiker way of life. We embrace it, and so it’s kind of a thing people say because of the camaraderie. They call me hiker trash because they know what it’s like to eat, or want to eat, food they find in the dirt on the trail, or because they know what it’s like to look for outlets outside a gas station, etc etc. Anyway, it was really nice of them to give me snacks, and it made me feel good. I hiked to a spot where I had a better signal and phoned REI. I sat on hold for a while and Traveler, Honey, Moon, and Candyman (A different, older, Candyman) passed by. I finally got on with a customer service rep and explained that the cord inside the poles had broken. They basically told me that they don’t replace parts and that I should contact Big Agnes. Way to go on the customer service REI! They weren’t helpful at all and left me feeling a bit exposed because I bought the tent specifically for the trail and from them, not Big Agnes. REI used to have much better service than this. I don’t think I’ve even had the tent 6 months.... Anyway, I called Big Agnes and they said they would sell me a new shock cord that I could replace. They viewed my shock cord breaking as “normal wear and tear and didn’t cover it under warranty. So, I ended up paying $17.50 to get that shipped to someplace I can probably be in 5 days in CT. Hopefully it won’t be too hard to fix myself. I wasn’t super happy there wasn’t a better solution, but it was what it was.
In between the REI call and the Big Agnes call, I walked down to the Bear Mountain lodge picnic area to use their facilities and buy an ice cream bar from a machine. After I finished the Big Agnes call, I met a section hiker named Jingle Butt. She was on day one of her hike - pretty exciting!
The trail passes right through a zoo. Apparently it is a rehab zoo, but it did feel a little depressing. I did not spend any time looking at the animals there. I don’t really like zoos, even though I like seeing animals. I like seeing them in the wild! They had a bear and it was literally laying in a hammock with buzzards around it. I’ll say no more.
I ran back into Jingle Butt and we helped each other take pictures as we crossed the Bear Mountain Bridge over the Hudson River. I liked this bridge better than the one over the Delaware because it shook less and there were fewer cars. On the other side of the bridge I hiked back into the woods and up a steep climb before leveling out. I saw a few deer and a garter snake along the way, as well as chatted with a few local hikers. 
Shortly after I arrived at the Appalachian Market. It’s basically a shell gas station with a deli attached, but they stock hiker foods like rice and pasta sides, ramen, etc., and also have a deli with a big menu! Traveler and that crew was outside eating, as well as No Excuse. I walked in and handled my resupply, then ordered a breakfast burrito and a side of fries. It was amazing! I then got a milkshake and a coffee and ordered a BLT to pack out. 
Clothesline, Fifty and Cheddar showed up, as well as two guys who have been hiking with No Excuse: Chimney and Big Push. Clothesline was meeting a relative to go into town because he accidentally dropped his phone off the bridge into the Hudson! I decided to hike out to A place nearby called the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center. They have a hiker pavilion there and I needed a dry place to sit (it was raining) to try and jimmy rig my tent poles together. No Excuse hiked out with me, and Corky tagged close behind.
The center was big, but after a .4 mile walk we came to the hiker pavilion. It was really nice and had electrical outlets, two porta potties, and a water source. I decided to sleep there for the night since the rain was picking up. I did manage to field repair my tent poles. I guess I’ll see if it lasts! Trailfish, Happy Feet, Stumbles and Candyman (the original, young Candyman I had met what seemed like eons ago in the days of snow) all showed up at the shelter. We have a full house for sure!
I was grateful today for the Americorps trail magic, the beautiful views, the support of my wife to keep me from jumping off a ledge dealing with REI and Big Agnes, and having this awesome free pavilion so close to the market. It was a day full of hidden and obvious blessings.
Postscript:
#1 - Gretchen, I definitely am not at the head of the pack! There are lots of hikers ahead of me. I’m around some hikers now who are much faster than me, but have taken time off the trail for various reasons. I pretty much walk at the same pace every day. My key is I get up early and walk long days. I like to be hiking by 6am if I can. I also love to do a “12 by 12,” Hiking 12 Miles by noon. If I do that the afternoon is easier when it’s hotter out.","West Mountain Shelter

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592644,"We had a full house at the field shelter at Graymoor last night. We were strewn about on the floor and woke up to a coating of mist. Everything was wet - sleeping bags, shoes, socks. The fog and humidity ensured we would never forget the rain from the night before. Well, maybe not “never,” but not this morning!
I woke up early but was not the first to rise. I got up a little after five and went about my routine. I was hiking by 6:15. I decided I would at least hike to the RPH Shelter about 19 miles away. Depending on the trail, the weather, how I felt, etc, I might push another few miles, up to 9 to the next shelter. I headed off into the mist.
The mist turned to light rain, and then for a brief period to heavier rain. I broke out my rain jacket for about 10 minutes and then gratefully packed it away. I hardly use it, other than for downpours or sustained heavier rains where I worry about getting cold. Today was not cold at all; it was incredibly humid. I trucked on and No Excuse and Chimney caught up to me at a road crossing. I let them pass ahead as they are young and faster. It’s amazing when people stop and take smoke breaks and then pass me later! Some of these guys are fast. Eventually I passed the two again and did not see them until later at the RPH Shelter. I went through a long patch where I didn’t like the look of the water sources so kept hiking and hiking.... In the end, I ran on two liters of water until I got to the shelter. It made my pack light at least! 
On the hike up I passed some day hikers, then had an interesting nature encounter. I walked around a turn and managed to surprise a wild turkey. I have seen a lot of wild turkeys out here, and this one was huge. It was a big male and it decided that it didn’t like me being in its turf. Usually they just run away and hide from me, this one made a bunch of noise and then stepped into the trail and squared up to me, flapping its wings and gobbling. Oh boy.... was I seriously about to have to fight off a turkey??? I mean, I know they probably have spurs like roosters, and this one was massive, but still. I lifted up my poles to make myself look big and backed up a little to give it space. Thus began the dance, because Mr. Turkey took this as a sign of weakness and started coming towards me. I raised my polls and kind of roared at it. Gillian and I had a tiny cat named Hallie who passed away right before I started the trail. She would get riled up and run around the house roaring like a little lion. I tried to channel my inner Hallie. The turkey then moved off the trail to my left and into the bushes, so I pushed ahead, only to have it come back out of the bushes towards me. What?! I hereby give this turkey the trail name Michael Myers, since he always kept coming back in the Halloween series. So Michael Myers comes flapping back gobbling at me, so I waived my trekking poles around and knocked them together a bit and kept advancing. Michael Myers ran out into the trail in front of me and headed north, away. This was a good sign. He then picked up speed and took off flying towards the east, away. And that is the store of how Hungry Cat faced off with Michael Myers and lived to tell the tale.
I hiked on and saw a few deer, and then climbed up to a nice view of Canopus Lake. The day had cleared up, but the humidity was so thick you could cut it with a knife. I actually made it to the shelter at 2pm, and when I found out i could have food delivered to the shelter, that sealed the deal for me that I would stay. The RPH Shelter is part shelter and part cabin. It’s basically an old cabin with the back removed. It’s a good setup with a few wooden bunks and lots of floor space. There is a rusty water pump outside. The water needs to be filtered, but it is great having the source so close. After a bit, No Excuse and Chimney showed up and we called and ordered food. I got Chinese food and they actually deliver it right to the shelter! The food was delicious! 
It was a good day of hiking and less wet than I expected. It was nice to get the miles in early and relax a bit. I was grateful for good legs today, the food, shelter, and some fun turkey time with Michael Myers. Tomorrow I will probably try and hike a bit farther.","Graymoor Spiritual Life Center

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592894,"Today was a long day, but a good one! I slipped out of the shelter at 6:15 to hike. The air was still and muggy, but it wasn’t In 5 miles there was a road crossing with a deli just about half a mile off the trail. I knew I wanted to push for 25 miles today so I wasn’t sure I wanted to stop there, but it only took one long uphill to make me feel hungry and change my mind. When I got to the road crossing, I headed over to the east.
The Mountain Top deli was small, sort of like a convenience store. The ladies working there were very friendly and knew all of the local customers, exchanging banter with them. I ordered a breakfast sandwich, which came with a free small coffee. As I poured the coffee, No Excuse wandered in. He ordered some food as well and we sat outside to eat. I also had a  Gatorade and a peanut butter snickers bar - delicious! The deli was an awesome pit stop. They even had outlets behind the building to charge phones, and a picnic table to sit at, though we sat on the bench out front.
After eating, we headed out and made it to the next shelter in good time. Chimney and Corky were there, and then Jingle Butt rolled in. After a short rest, we hiked on. This was the first day I would really hike with Chimney and No Excuse. I hiked behind them and we talked about various things. They keep up a pretty quick pace, and chatting with them on top of that made the miles go fast. We came to a garden center that had a hiker box, log book, sodas for sale, and a spigot for water - awesome! I had a couple of sodas and picked up a bit more bug spray. We talked to some folks just outside the store, and then made our final push to camp.
We had all gotten kind of eaten alive last night at the RPH Shelter, so we decided to tent at Wiley. There was also a strange, non hiker woman at the shelter who was kind of creeping us out. We suspected she was harmless and maybe just had some mental issues. Anyway, she was fine and kept to herself in the shelter. I went to get water and when I came back Transformer was there! I hadn’t seen him since Damascus. He’d just been in New York City for a few days to do some sightseeing. He’s from Australia, so is definitely trying to take some city side trips as well as hike the trail.
Today was a good day. I enjoyed getting to know No Excuse and Chimney a little better, and was grateful for their pace and stories. I was also very happy that the weather was good, even if it was hot. Today was just a lot of fun all around!","RPH Shelter
",Wiley Shelter,"Jun 02, Sat",25.60
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592904,"It did not end up raining overnight, so getting out of camp this morning was easy. I was on the trail by 6:30. It didn’t take No Excuse and Chimney long to catch up. We weren’t hiking very long when we ran into a guy in running clothes on the trail. He said hello and asked if there were more of us, and then said “hang on, I’ve got breakfast in the car,” and took off running north! We hiked on and eventually came to a parking lot right at the New York / Connecticut border. The man was at his car with the hatchback open. He had all kinds of food and drink: pancakes, brownies, donuts, bagels with cream cheese and peanut butter, apples, watermelon, and coffee and sodas! He also had some bug spray available for us to use! He was a trail angel from Connecticut and his trail name was Trail Mixer, which was also the name of his local trail running club. He was just out doing trail magic for National Trails Day. He said that he hopes to thru hike the AT one day. The trail magic was really incredible and got me pumped up. I really hope he is able to pursue a thru hike one day! 
We took pictures with Trail Mixer and he took pictures of us at the CT border sign. We would dip into NY again briefly today, but that was it. We were in Connecticut! It’s always exciting to start another state. I was particularly excited because I have never been to Connecticut. 
We all hiked on and Connecticut almost immediately greeted us with some very steep inclines. That would be the theme for the rest of the day! We met flip floppers Hansel and Gretel - I had been seeing their names in the shelter logs. Chimney and No Excuse went to go do a small resupply in a nearby town and I kept hiking.  I went up some more steep inclines up to Caleb’s peak, and saw a white tailed deer up there. The downhill after the peak was intense, and it felt a little like my knees had been battered by sticks afterward. The final stretch of the day was beautiful, walking along a flat section of trail beside the Housatonic River. I stopped into Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter to sign the log, but pushed on another 0.4 miles to the Stony Brook campsite. It was a lovely spot and I was happy to be there earlier in the afternoon. I set up camp, ate dinner with Transformer when he arrived, then went down to the river to soak my feet in the cold water while I chatted with my wife. No Excuse and Chimney showed up a little later after a successful resupply mission. 
I was grateful for the beautiful weather today - we had a nice breeze all day that helped keep things a little cooler and keep the bugs down. I was grateful for the wonderful trail magic today and to be in a new state for new adventures. It’s supposed to rain overnight and tomorrow. Hopefully the rain will be light!","Wiley Shelter

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593085,"I woke up early to the sound of rain on my tent. It had rained much of the night. I checked the forecast and saw that it was supposed to start clearing up after 8am, so I went back to sleep for a bit. I woke up at about 7:45 and started getting my things in order. I heard Chimney, No Excuse, and then Transformer leave. I ate a Cinnamon Toast Crunch bar inside my tent, then hit the trail at 9. That’s pretty late for me, but the timing was good as the rain was halting. 
It was chilly outside so I hiked in rain gear until I got through a few nearby meadows and some climbs and had warmed up. I passed a Flip Flopper named Princess. She had recently slipped and fell, hitting her face. She said her eye swelled shut and it was pretty bad a few days ago. Yikes! I also heard that NOBO hiker Spice broke her ankle and is off trail. I feel bad for her, but it could happen to any of us. That’s the scary thing....
I came to a river crossing, Guinea Brook, and it was flooded and the rocks that are normally there as a pathway across were submerged and part of a big rapid that has formed there. Unfortunately, I didn’t check Guthook to learn about a bypass trail for this crossing, so I spent the next 40 minutes climbing over deadfalls and walking off trail along the bank trying to find a place to cross. Nothing! There were no safe spots to cross. I climbed up the hill to a road and saw a hiker getting dropped off at the trailhead. Just then No Excuse responded to a text I had sent and told me to take the bypass trail. I saw the blue blazes now and cursed myself for not thinking to check the guide. I must’ve spent 40 minutes trying to find a way to cross!! As I got closer I realized the other hiker was Sharkbait! I hadn’t seen him since Daleville, VA. We walked along together on the bypass trail until we got back to the AT on the other side of the Brook. 
The rain held off and the cool weather made for awesome hiking. It helped keep the bugs down, and probably helped me sweat less. I passed another NOBO I hadn’t met yet - Reboot. He started at Springer a little before I did. Originally my plan was to hike to Falls Village and, before proceeding, try to see if there was a good and close to the trail food option. I figured I would try and duck in for a meal or snacks and then keep hiking. I never made it to the village though, because as I came up on a nearby road crossing, two guys standing in the parking lot waived me over and said they were going to feed me. Turns out it was the famous trail angel Fresh Ground! The man, the myth, the legend, was here in the flesh and feeding me! I had been hearing about Fresh Ground since Tennessee, but had yet to run into him. He travels up and down the trail feeding hikers. It was really amazing, and the timing couldn’t have been better as I’d run out of snacks and was quite hungry. I sat down and he made me two cheeseburgers. I also had a grilled cheese sandwich, banana, some watermelon, pringles, celery, carrots, and beans. Lie I said, it was pretty incredible. I washed all that down with Koolaid. Sharkbait and Reboot showed up and ate as well. We all talked for a while and then hiked north. When I first got to that lot, Fresh Ground said something to the effect of: “I represent all the people out there who support you and want you to succeed.” That resonated with me because there have been so many people who have supported me in doing this in so many different ways. That statement, along with the timing of it all today, made it feel truly magical. Thanks Fresh Ground!!
I hiked further to camp by a huge rock called Giant’s Thumb. I took a picture and you can see why it is named that. Sharkbait hammocked nearby. The hiking in Connecticut has been difficult so far, with lots of steep climbs and steep descents. I really needed the boost I got today! I felt like I had the energy I needed to finish out my day from all of that great food! 
I was grateful for the weather not dumping rain on me today, grateful for the temperature staying a bit cooler, and also for the amazing opportunity to meet Fresh Ground and to eat his delicious offerings. What a day!","Stony Brook Campsite

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593197,"So much of a thru hike is a mental game. Sure, one has to be up to the physical challenge, but one can take the trail as slowly as one wants really. The real challenge is the mental side of things - the drive to keep going when everything hurts, everything is wet and cold or hot and sticky, when your one good leg is covered in dirt and ticks and your torso is chafed from your own salt deposits because you haven’t showered or done laundry in 10 days, and when you are so hungry that you can’t think straight, but you’ve run out of snacks until you resupply....in 16 miles. Don’t forget about the loved ones you miss but can’t see! The mental game is real and, in my opinion, the hardest part about a thru hike. It takes a solid constitution to get through that stuff, and reminders of why I’m hiking the hike. Don’t get me wrong, I love what I’m doing and the adventure is amazing! Honestly, I haven’t had a bad day on the trail yet. I’ve had challenges just like any other thru hiker, sure, but keeping perspective and focus is important for me and also hard to do sometimes. To do that, I have to remind myself why I’m doing this, and remember that when challenging weather or circumstances come my way, they will pass. I’ve heard a lot of folks say “never quit on a bad day,” and I firmly believe this. It is often when a series of challenges has me feeling a little beaten down that I am on the verge of having a wonderful experience, seeing an amazing view, or meeting someone who somehow lifts me up. I also believe that the really amazing days out here would not be possible without struggle, pain, discomfort, and frustration. Those things help set the foundation for good experiences to come. Without them, I cannot experience the full joy of a nice view, or a few rays of sun through the trees on a chilly morning. 
Lately I have been super tired, so while I have a little energy I wanted to reflect on how I’ve been feeling. Somewhere towards the end of NY and the beginning of CT, the trail started kicking my butt a little. I guess it really started with the pounding that PA dished out with her rain and rocks. And then Jersey was tough with the heat and swamps, though it had some awesome unique hiking and I really liked it. I recovered a bit after that (mentally), and then started struggling a little when I got close to CT. I was hiking a bit with others, which kind of helped, but I was sort of on auto pilot - just banking miles through the woods. Overall I was still glad I was hiking, but the luster had worn off. I was tired and achey and gross and greasy and wet. I think things came to a head for me the other day when I got to that flooded brook and didn’t see the sign for the bypass trail. I wasn’t going to snap, but I acknowledged that I was like some kind of dumb animal, clamoring out of the woods up to a road after stumbling along a river bank collecting ticks and filth on my legs. Then I saw Sharkbait. Sometimes all it takes to start a reversal is a friendly face. And then when I was tired and hot and pushing through overgrown trail and a virtual tick buffet, Fresh Ground was there. At that moment yesterday, I got some energy back and started to feel better. I got a little pep in my step, and as the temperature dropped a bit and the flies abated, the scenery started to change a little and the trail worked it’s magic. It always does. If I just hang in there, the trail really does always provide. The tough times pass and I am given the greatest gifts. When I camped with Sharkbait last night, something about that stealth spot was so perfect. The rain laid off and my wet tent dried a bit overnight. This morning and today I really started to notice a change in scenery as I hiked down into, and then later out of, Salisbury, CT. Everything about today was just awesome, and I managed to fall back in love with the trail. I have heard other hikers talk about similar experiences. I told myself before I started that I would never quit, no matter what, but I told myself why, and it was simple: because this adventure is a true gift, and to fully receive it I have to get comfortable with the uncomfortable. Just as Mr. Miyagi told Daniel-San not to question him, but to do what he asked, so must I embrace this adventure and all its twists and turns. Never quit on a bad day. 
Anyway, I thought it would be good to check in. I know some of my journal entries have been lackluster. It’s mostly because I get quite tired and just end up repeatedly dropping my phone on my face as I rush to finish an entry at night. The trail takes the energy it needs from me - only the trail knows what energy, what anything, I really need. And it is always right. 
Hitting the 1500 mile mark was exciting today! I have come to grips with the fact that this journey, one that once seemed as if it would last forever, will indeed come to an end. I know now that it is only the beginning of so many new doors to open. I feel like when one embarks one fledgling goal and it begins to take shape, there is a chemistry that happens by which the mind becomes a receptor anew, and therefore a multiplier effect occurs. One adventure, one stimulus, opens the door to many more. I shall see, I guess. Anyway, I think I’m at peace with the eventual end of this particular trek. I freaked out a bit at mile 1000, but it only took me 500 miles to recover! ;-)
Hiking into Salisbury today was beautiful. The cool temperature (it was 47 when I woke up), the sun, and the pasture with mountains in the background as I walked into town were incredible. I met two hikers where the trail hits the road and chatted with them briefly, helping them take a picture by the AT sign and then a picture with me! The two ladies were from Maryland and planning to hike the section of trail I had just come down. I wish I could remember their names - I forgot to jot them down. 
I walked into town (it was about half a mile off trail) and went to the post office. The postal worker was super friendly. When I walked up to the counter he said “I gave your package to another Hiker to eat.” He obviously knew I was hiking and he assumed I had a food resupply in the mail, but it was actually my new tent pole shock cord, so I laughed and said “my package is not edible,” to which he said “he ate it anyway.” Obviously the guy knows thru hikers! I asked him about a place to eat and he told me that the town didn’t have what I wanted (cheap stick to your ribs breakfast food), but that there was a bit pricier food at the Country Bistro. I think he was the nicest postal worker I have ever met! I walked over to Country Bistro and it was definitely not cheap, but it wasn’t too bad really. It reminded me of Atlanta prices. I ate two breakfast burritos, some French toast, a side of toast with butter and jam, and washed it all down with a bunch of coffee. The waitress there was super nice and ended up giving me a cinnamon roll to take with me on the trail! The place was very hiker friendly, and I really appreciated that because I know I was gross looking and smelly.
I walked to the local grocery and resupplied. I felt good about my food choices and like it would be enough. It was expensive there, but they had good options. I meant to mention that a while back I tried those Gatorade bars finally. I really liked them! They can be hard to find, but I keep my eyes peeled for them. This trip I got a hodgepodge of bars, mostly cliff. I broke down and organized my food on a bench outside while I drank a veggie smoothie and a monster energy drink. An older gentleman sat down and we started chatting. He told me that Salisbury was expensive because one year the New York Times ran an article that basically said “forget the Hamptons; that’s so yesterday! Go get yourself a cottage in Connecticut.” He then said that everyone in Salisbury was old and had money. I told him the people working inside were all super young, and he said “they work here, but they don’t live here.” Got it!
I hiked out of town and sadly passed by an ice cream place with no room for it! Oh well - it was probably expensive anyway. As I hiked I looked at the sky. I couldn’t tell if it was going to pour on me or not. The wind picked up a bit. I just hiked on. The trail was beautiful and passed through a coniferous forest and up to Lions Head for an nice view, and then Bear Mountain for an even better one. I met three folks of about college age at the Bear Mountain summit and  we chatted a bit before I headed out. After the descent down Bear Mountain, the trail travels through a beautiful old growth hemlock forest along the banks of Sawmill Brook. This section was stunning. The brook is a series of large drops and pools, with waterfalls and moss-covered rocks. The hemlocks are spaces apart, but their large, thick canopies shadow the forest floor. As I approached the end of this section and the MA border, I saw some type of crane sitting on a rock in the middle of the brook, perhaps enjoying the ambiance himself, though more likely looking for a meal. I took a picture of him. Just like that, I was in Massachusetts!
MA started off with a bang as I climbed two steep peaks. First was Mt. Race. The trail crawled along an exposed ridgeline at the summit, offering spectacular views of the valleys and hills below. After this I climbed even higher to Mt, Everett. I managed to get one view off the mountain near the summit, but it didn’t have the visibility or views that Mt Race had. I hiked down to the shelter just shortly after the mountain. There are two shelters close together. Reboot, Sharkbait, and Transformer were all there, as well as a bunch of other folks I didn’t know. The storms had passed over without consequence, and it was already getting chilly so the mosquitos were mostly in hiding. I sat outside my tent on the ground and reflected on my day as I whipped up some chicken sriracha flavored ramen. I really couldn’t have asked for a better day; I was in love with the trail again.","Stealth Campsite next to Giant’s Thumb at Mile 1497.3

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593261,"Ok, I did quite a bit of brain dumping yesterday, so today I am going to keep this short. I made it to camp by 4pm and it’s 5:30 now. I want to do some reading and talk to Sharkbait and Reboot if and when they make it here. I made it to camp pretty early namely because there were a lot of pasture walks and forest path that was flat. However, interspersed with that were some steep and rugged climbs.
In the morning I climbed Mt. Bushnell, and on the north side there was a nice viewpoint and ridge called “Jug End.” Im not sure but I assume that has to do with the shape of the mountain. I passed the road crossing for Great Barrington and walked through some lovely pasture, and then by a monument marking the location of Shays Rebellion in 1787. The trail passed along the Housatonic river once again, this time with a sign that said not to eat fish from the river because they contain PCBs. Great....
Near the Tom Leonard Shelter there is a feature called Ice Gulch. Apparently this deep ravine can hold snow even in mid summer. I was expecting some ridiculously deep chasm but it really wasn’t that crazy.  What surprised me there was the body of a dead porcupine in the trail, covered in flies with its entrails hanging out. YUCK! I wonder what got him.....
I hiked on. The hemlock forests were beautiful again today! White birches are probably my favorite tree, but hemlock are a close second, of not my favorite from time to time.
I climbed past the Mt Wilcox South shelter up to a pond with obvious beaver activity and a beaver lodge. I looked for one but didn’t see any. 
It was a great day with great weather! I was grateful for all the beautiful views I saw today, for the cooler temperatures, and that I wasn’t that dead rotting porcupine in the trail! Gross!!!","Glen Brook Shelter
",Mt Wilcox North Shelter,"Jun 06, Wed",21.40
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593360,"I woke up early today in my tent. It was another chilly morning, but it felt nice. I ran out of bug spray so the cooler temperature helps keep the hordes of mosquitos away! I ate pop tarts, bellivita breakfast biscuits, and a Justin’s peanut butter packet for breakfast in my tent, and then packed it all up and headed out. It was foggy, so everything felt a little moist. Reboot was at the shelter last night, so he was right behind me. Sharkbait decided to push on and camped 4 miles north. He’s a beast!!! He said he saw a mother bear and two cubs there.
Last night as I uploaded my entry, another porcupine walked right across the trail in front of me. I took a picture of it, though it isn’t very good. Today the plan was to hike 20 miles or so to the October shelter. That would position me for a morning with the cookie lady, and then an afternoon in Dalton, and then escape from Dalton in time to camp at the first shelter out of the town. I want to utilized a free shower in town to clean up, as well as their cook laundry, and I need to resupply. It’s been a while since I got clean - I think 9 or 10 days ago - whenever I stayed at Mosey’s in New Jersey. Anyhoo, it doesn’t bother me that much to be nasty, honestly!
As I hiked today I saw a few deer and LOTS of chipmunks. I love them so much! I always call them Lucy as they remind me of my cat :-). They are all over the forest and trail, but today it felt like they were extra bold and curious about what I was doing. As I hiked along, I started thinking about the Upper Goose Pond Shelter. It was supposed to be a cabin on a pond that you could stay in, and some hikers last night told me they served pancakes for breakfast! Also, Guthook said they had canoes to paddle. It just seemed like a trail jewel that shouldn’t be missed. I finally decided I would go. This trip is supposed to be about not having a schedule and focusing on adventure, so that’s what I did! Also, my right quad was twinging on me a bit today. That has not happened before, so I figured it was better to have a short day and rest.
I got to the cabin after many ups and downs, some of which really slowed me down. The cabin was amazing! The caretaker, Pete, gave me the tour. The bunkhouse is on the second floor. There is a common area with books and games and a fireplace. There is a wash station, area to cook with our camp stoves, laundry line, canoes, a dock, bear box, etc. I would definitely say that out of all the cool shelters I’ve been to, this one is top of the list! I’m so glad I decided to stop and walk the half mile side trail to it.
I dried out my tent and went and made coffee and ate a bunch of chocolate by the lake. I watched the Lucys chase each other and sit on stumps, staring at me (and my food bag). I helped bring some water up from the pond for Pete, and then sat on the porch for a while and chatted with him. He had some extra food and said he didn’t want to carry it down the mountain, so he offered to cook me dinner! Pretty incredible! He made beef stew and corn on the cob. A section Hiker showed up and he was able to join for dinner as well. 
This was really turning out to be quite the experience, and I’m really glad I stayed! After first dinner, section Hiker and I went down and got the rest of the jugs of spring water from the lake. I then went out back and made my own dinner. I was still hungry and it was in my meal plan.... Two section hikers from the shelter last night showed up, and then who walks in but Dude! If you remember, I had hiked with him and Happy Feet a bit back in NJ and NY, and then he hiked into NYC for his 21st birthday via the New York Long Path. Pretty amazing that he already caught up!
We all chatted for a while, but the sun gets low and goes down, and that sends all hikers to bed. I was grateful today that I didn’t let mileage “goals” get in the way of a wonderful experience. I was able to change my day’s plan, adapt, slow down and have an adventure. I was also very grateful for Pete’s hospitality, the food, and such a cool experience. This cabin really is amazing! Lastly, I was grateful that other hikers showed up. It was great to see and hear them enjoy the experience as well. 
Tomorrow will be interesting. I will be hiking to the Cookie Lady before Dalton. I may make it into Dalton, but if the day is getting late I will probably stop a few miles before just because I have a lot of cleaning and shopping to do in town.  Time for this cat to do the night’s long nap! Pancakes and coffee in the morning - I’m so excited!Postscripts:#1 - thanks everyone for the kind words and support! I appreciate it :-). It means a lot to me that even strangers want to see me make it all the way - the hiking community and support network, which you are part of, is amazing! #2 - Beaker, thanks for your note! I’m very excited about what is to come. I’m now a little nervous though as a section Hiker today was telling me there is a very dangerous section of trail (perhaps on Moosilaukee) that most people hike southbound. Ring any bells? Something about there being wooden blocks but you can fall and die....  Sounds like the climb out of Palmerton on crack times a million with a horde of porcupines chasing you. I hope it’s not really that crazy!#3 - Koko! Hope your hike is going swimmingly! I dunno, I think there are just a lot of steeper ups and downs in CT and MA. The elevation profile on AWOL doesn’t look bad, and then I’m on the balls of my feet huffing up a steep slope. They are not super long, but it feels like there are a lot, and in CT there are some pretty technical descents that jar the knees and are slow going, especially if wet. It may be that I’m hungry and tired and when you get to it you’ll be thinking I’m crazy. I hope so anyway!","Mt Wilcox North Shelter
",Upper Goose Pond Cabin,"Jun 07, Thu",14
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593477,"Today started in an interesting manner. I knew Pete (the cabin caretaker) had said that breakfast would be ready around 6. I woke up at about 5:40, and slowly started to get my things ready. Just before 6, I heard a light whistling. The whistling grew steadily louder, and the door to the bunkhouse opened. There was Pete, a plate of pancakes in his hand, whistling us awake like an old-fashioned alarm. It was awesome! We all toddler downstairs like sleepy children at Christmas time, knowing what was coming next: pancakes! Pete had coffee ready, and was churning out the pancakes one after the other. The best part was that he added blueberries to them. They were delicious! I just kept eating them. The section hikers quickly got full, and then even Dude got full. Not me! I figured as long as he was still making them I would eat. I slathered them with country time tub butter and poured obscene amounts of Log Cabin syrup on them, like Will Ferrell in Elf. I wanted to lick my plate, but managed to scrape it clean with this thing called a “fork.” I hadn’t used a non rounded version in a while! Breakfast was a real treat, and Pete was such a champ of a caretaker. Blueberry (the section Hiker who warned me about Moosilaukee) put it best when he said to Pete: “sir, you are a scholar and a gentleman.” He really was!
After thanking Pete, I said my goodbyes to the others and hiked out. My next stop was the Cookie Lady. Her house was 11 miles away just off the trail, but when I got there she wasn’t home. There were no cookies either. I was able to pick up my mail drop, but I really wanted to meet her. I sat with a section hiker and had a snack and then signed her log book, but finally I left. As I walked out, Dude was walking in. He said he would camp out for a while to see if she showed. 
A little disappointed, I walked on. I hoped that Dude would be able to meet her. My spirits were soon lifted, however, when once again the trail proves that I am always right where I’m supposed to be. I came to the road crossing for Blotz Road and I heard a voice say “trail magic.” I looked over and there was a guy sitting there with a cooler. I went over and he had quite the setup! He said he had driven 76 miles and wasn’t sure if he would even see anyone and that I was the first person to come by. When I told him I was thru hiking from Springer, he got really pumped up. His name was John and he has aspirations of thru hiking one day. He had just been laid off, unfortunately, but he was upbeat about it and was using the time to do some hiking. Anyway, he was a really nice and thoughtful guy! He had sodas and lots of amazing “junk” food like twinkies, Debbie Cakes, snickers and M&Ms. He had a LOT of awesome snacks - all the stuff we want! I sat and chatted with him for a while as a few section hikers rolled through. I also texted Dude to let him know as I was not too far north of the Cookie Lady. John was just a great person, like all of the other trail angels / trail magicians I have met. I left feeling great and hoping that he would find a way to thru hike one day.
I walked on and eventually got to the turn off for Kay Wood Shelter. It was 3:30, but I wanted to do quite a few things in Dalton, so I thought it best not to go into town late. My plan is to get up early, hike the 3 miles into town, and then do my business there: shower in the free town shower, do laundry, eat. I will then hike 10 miles and hit the next town, Cheshire, where I will resupply and hike out. Tomorrow will be a full and interesting day! Dude showed up at the shelter. He didn’t meet the Cookie Lady either, but he did get trail magic from John!
Today I was grateful for a lovely communal breakfast, the magic of the trail and John’s trail magic, a beautiful day for hiking, and the wonderful support I get from all who are reading this! Tomorrow will be another adventure!

#1 - Beaker, thanks! Duly noted on Moosilaukee. You’re right - I have to remind myself sometimes that I’m a brave and fierce thru hiker. For example, I showed that Michael Myers what’s what! But seriously, that makes me feel better. I’m not good at changing directions. I walk north, and if I stick with that I don’t get lost! Now to find that moose....
#2 - Section Hiker Blueberry from the Cabin was an interesting guy. From Washington State, he previously attempted a thru hike of the AT with his wife. She broke her ankle, which ended their trip. He later attempted a solo thru hike. He started really missing her and pushing longer and longer days, and then hurt his knee and ended his hike. He is now a self-described “LASHER” - long ass section hiker. He had a great bear story and a picture to go with it. He was sitting at a campsite eating by his tent, and a bear wandered down and literally walked up to his stuff to where he had to get up and leave. The bear picked up a bag he had with a sandwich in it right from the vestibule of his tent and walked off with the sandwich flapping out of its mouth. He had a picture of the bear right at his tent. 
#3 - Dude apparently took a picture of me in full hiker trash mode at the creamery back in NY. I didn’t know at the time because I was sleeping off my banana split and hot dogs on the ground. I uploaded that for your viewing amusement.","Upper Goose Pond Cabin

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593556,"Last night was interesting. Right around the time I started to fall asleep, fireworks started exploding in town. I only saw one or two, but there were a lot! It’s funny camping so close to a town - I’m in the woods, but I still hear road noise and, well, fireworks! I got up at about 5:15 and was hiking at 6. I had a lot I wanted to do today, and stop number one was breakfast in Dalton, 3 miles away. 
I made it to town in an hour and took in the scenery and houses as I walked. Dalton is cute. It struck me as a classic small Massachusetts borough. There were some really nice houses in the neighborhood that the trail passes through. I diverged from the trail where it turns off of Main Street and headed to the Dalton Restaurant, which is really like a diner. Apollo and Skutch dropped me a text and said that it was good. It was also conveniently across from the Dalton CRA community recreation center, which has free showers for hikers. Step one: eat. Step two: eat again. Step 3: shower. And that’s pretty much what I did.
Dude met me at the diner and had breakfast with me. I started with an omelet with a bunch of stuff in it and Swiss cheese, rye toast with butter and jam, and a side of corned beef hash. You know, some light fare. I drank coffee and loaded it with creamer. As a second course, I had a giant Belgian waffle with strawberries and a mound of whipped cream on it. Of course, I poured syrup all over it a la Elf, and ate it all even though there was a long black hair on it. Just a hair? No problem. After breakfast Dude split and I walked across the street for the shower.
The lady at the CRA desk was like an angel. She was so nice and didn’t flinch at my nastiness. She handed me a beautiful puffy white towel and just touching it felt amazing. I went the wrong way at first and walked right into a ladies yoga class with my pack and trekking poles and towel, like a heathen bursting in on some Buddhist vow of silence retreat. Whoops! I, the hobo invader, quickly closed the door and heard the front desk lady laughing. She pointed me down the stairs.
The locker room was super clean and had shampoo and soap. It also had a sauna. I was tempted, but I did have a lot to do today so I stuck with just the shower. I spent a long time in that shower! I washed my hair at least three times. Similarly, I washed the rest of my body multiple times, trying my best to scrub the dead skin off without a wash cloth. It felt incredible! I used my Swiss Army knife scissors to trim my gangly nose hairs, because that’s a thing I have to do now. I trimmed up some of the mustache hairs that were growing into my mouth. I looked like the opposite of Crocodile Dundee. I wasn’t shaving, and I was using scissors from an inch and a half long knife. There was a guy shaving next to me. He didn’t flinch or comment though! 
Once clean, I put on my laundry washing attire - my rain pants and rain jacket. I wear these so that I can wash all of my clothes. There was a laundry in town, but I had heard that The Shamrock Inn would let non guests do laundry on occasion. That was a lot closer, so I walked there. I lumbered down the street with my pack in my rain suit, completely commando underneath, like some kind of hack flasher. I wore crocs and carried my shoes, trekking poles, and ditty bag with my money and charger handy. I charged my battery pack and phone at the diner and the CRA, but it needed a bit more time. And time it would get....
The Shamrock Inn was awesome and let me do my laundry there for five bucks! I hung out in their guest lounge, dusting my nasal palate with that special motel bouquet. I detected hints of cigarettes, lost childhoods, kool aid, and regret. In all seriousness though, the Inn was great and a good spot for hikers. They had a “catio,” which was a sun room built out for their two cats, who lounged in it. One cat was super sweet. I spent some time petting her. The other cat reminded me of that rabid raccoon. It had an oddly psychotic way about it - the way it’s face looked when it meowed for me to open the door, the way it tried to bite me after I petted it too long. I think it’s name was Sassy or something like that.
The laundry took 45 minutes per cycle, so I sat there a while and read some, as well as did some logistics planning. I saw Blueberry leaving the motel. He had stayed last night. He said he hiked in at almost 11pm. When my laundry was done, I used their bathroom to change into my shorts and T-shirt. Wow it felt good to have clean clothes on! They probably would have benefited from two washes, but they were clean enough.
I walked back towards the trail for my next mission: lunch. I wanted to go to Angelina’s Sub Shop. I had heard good things and it was just around the corner. Before I even got there, I saw some hikers waiving and yelling Hungry Cat. It was No Excuse, Chimney, Good Push, and Happy Feet! They had camped at the Cookie Lady’s house last night and hiked in from there. I caught up with them a bit while eating a sub and a whoopie pie. I found out that No Excuse had hurt his big toe. He got a weird blister that was full of nasty fluid and his toe was really sore. He then kept hiking and adjusted his stride, which made him strain his leg. It was not good. He wanted to try hiking a few light mike days to see how it feels, so they were just going to a campsite 3 or so miles out of town. I hope that he takes care of himself and doesn’t push too hard and make it worse - he’s so close !! It would be rough to get taken out by injury now. At the same time, I understand the challenge of holding back given my experience in Damascus. I felt badly for him and I hope he improves with a bit of rest.
I hiked out of town with No Excuse and Happy Feet. I still planned to push on to Cheshire, do a light resupply, and hike out of town. However, I then remembered that I needed to go to the outfitter in Cheshire. I wanted to get some permethrin and a fuel canister. I had a little over 8 Miles to go, and the outfitter was 2.5 miles out of town (a hitch) and they closed at 5. At that point I probably wouldn’t make it. Happy Feet was on the phone with someone, so I apologized to No Excuse for rushing off, but explained to him the timing issue. He suggested calling them to see if I could make the purchase over the phone and have them leave the stuff outside their store. This was a great idea and ultimately what I ended up doing. 
I hiked off with great purpose towards Cheshire and made good time there. I just love how the trail took me to two towns in one day - it was really fun! I called Berkshire Outfitters and the gentleman Steve was really cool. He said his daughter was hiking up in the Presidentials  now, and he ended up driving the canister and permethrin to me in town after closing the shop. He was awesome, and also snuck in a free energy gel for me! Super cool Steve! On the way into Cheshire, the trail passes through a cute neighborhood and then by an ice cream and sandwich shop called Diane’s Twist. I grabbed a strawberry cheesecake milkshake, a nod to the day Sourkraut and I got milkshakes at the Brushy Mountain Outpost when we thought it would be closed. After I met with Steve, I decided it was getting late and I shouldn’t attempt to resupply and do the climb out of town. Instead, I went to a church just down the road where hikers can stay for free. It was pretty awesome and Transformer was there. It had a huge parking lot, so I set to work treating my stuff with permethrin, which will be the final treatment I do. After that, I walked over to Dollar General for a light resupply. I LOVE how cheap DG is! This one even had cliff bars. Conveniently across the street was a gas station with a Dunkin Donuts inside. I went over and got a breakfast sandwich to take back to the church. 
Today was a good day and I felt like I got a lot accomplished. I feel clean and organized and ready to tackle Mt. Greylock, the highest peak in MA, tomorrow.  I was grateful for the kindness of others today and for all of the good eats, as well as some of the town scenery. Tomorrow I will wake up on a church lawn and start the day!","Kay Wood Shelter

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593676,"I woke up damp. I tented without my rain fly because it was a clear night. I like to look at the stars and it is also quicker to get going in the morning. I guess we had a lot of moisture in the air overnight because my sleeping bag had a ton of condensation on it, as did my tent in general. Transformer camped there as well and had the same experience. 
We hiked out at about 6:30. The church was locked so we decided to walk up the trail and duck in the gas station with the Dunkin Donuts to use the “privy.” I went up to order a small coffee and the gentleman behind the counter said he had accidentally made two unnecessary coffees and offered them to me for free. Awesome!! Of course, I bought a blueberry donut and gave one of the coffees to Transformer. It was a good start to the day.
We climbed Mt Greylock, Massachusetts’ highest peak. It has a cool tower at the top and with the clear day we got great views. We stopped by the lodge restaurant to get some food, but they were between shifts. However, the lady there was really nice and gave us some leftover blueberry muffins for free. Score! 
I hung back to dry my gear in the sun and Transformer moved on. Once dry, I took off and hiked solidly until the road crossing for Williamstown. It was a cute little spot and the trail entered a neighborhood before it hit the main road. I headed west off trail to a Stop N’ Shop and ran back into Transformer there. We had both decided to do a bigger resupply there to get us to Killington. After shopping I ate a salad and a fruit bowl I had gotten. On the way in a local had tipped me off that there was a cool trail we could hike back to the AT instead of a road walk, so we took our chances.  It was a great walk with a suspension bridge and some trail art. 
On the way to the shelter we left MA and entered Vermont. It felt great! I loved MA, but was excited to be in Vermont. Like Connecticut, it was my first time to Vermont.  When we got to the shelter we met 4 or 5 people on day one of their thru hikes of the Vermont Long Trail. That was really fun! I helped one girl hang her bear bag because she had never done it. 
I was grateful for such a full day and some great trail magic today! It was enjoyable hiking with Transformer, and I was grateful to make it to another state on my journey north.","Cheshire, MA, (Our Lady of the Assumption Church, Mile 1578.8)

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593831,"I’m going to keep today’s journal short. Not a lot really happened, and I feel like I need more sleep tonight. I woke up early and headed out just after Transformer. We reconnected later in the morning and had hiked about 13 miles by noon. I passed a couple of scenic beaver ponds in the morning, but otherwise scenery was just the usual woods as we are still climbing a bit to elevation. I felt really tired after climbing out of the road gap for Bennington, but I took a little lunch time siesta at a shelter and felt much better. The rest of the day was just steady climbs. Oh, and I peed on my shoe today. I was doing my business and checking Guthook and my right foot started getting warm.... I guess I should pay more attention! Most people might not admit this, but as you have probably noticed I have no shame in relaying human experiences. I’m just going to call this one marking my territory.
I’m loving this Vermont weather so far!! I was grateful for the weather, the good hiking banter with Transformer, and for a shelter to nap in today. Tomorrow is gonna be fun!

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594367,"It was a brisk 42 degrees when I woke up this morning. I actually woke up a little chilly around 4am and put my grubby T-shirt on over my long underwear top. It felt good to be cozy in my bag though. When I woke up, I went about my morning routine - pack up the inside of my tent, get my food bag and eat breakfast in my tent, brush my teeth, pack up my tent, strip off my jacket and hike off in my shorts and T-shirt. I was hiking by 6:20. 
Just following the Shelter was the lookout tower atop Glastenbury Mountain. I climbed up and thought that it was locked. It was chilly but offered some nice views. Transformer arrived shortly after me and climbed up. I kept moving to get warm. Later on he caught up to me and said that not only was the tower actually open, but a girl was up there and had slept in it last night! He opened the hatch and they both startled each other. She had been at the shelter when we got there that evening. I don’t know how well I would sleep in one of those towers, especially if it was really windy. 
We took a break after 5 miles and pulled over at Kid Gore Shelter. While I was eating a snack, a curious and brave chipmunk sat nearby eating a snack of his own that he had foraged off the shelter floor. He kept looking at my food hopefully.  I took a picture of him - so cute!
There was another shelter after 10 miles and we ducked in there for a snack break too. We then worked on the climb up to the summit of Stratton Mountain. Everywhere it smelled like Christmas trees. The forest was full of fir trees. It smelled so refreshing! There was another lookout tower here with incredible views - just stunning. I could see ski slopes that would come to life in the winter, lakes, and mountains upon mountains. This was the best view I’ve had in Vermont so far. A nearby summit view is actually where Benton MacKaye was inspired to create the AT. 
Transformer and I talked with a local couple for a bit before hiking on. We walked down to Stratton Pond, which was quite large and gorgeous. You can swim in it, but it’s a little too chilly yet, and I’m not the biggest freshwater pond swimming guy. I like a good sandy beach! We trekked on to the William Douglas Shelter, but the side trail was half a mile, so we opted to stealth camp in the woods just across a brook.
Today, just at the Winhall River, we crossed the 3/4 way mark at mile 1643. I’m now in the final 25% of this journey! I feel good about that. I have enough left to really savor and enjoy it, but I will also get to see my wife and kitty in a reasonable amount of time. Transformer and I were going to make a monument with sticks, but we were tired and forgot about it until we got to camp! This milestone did spark some interesting conversation earlier in the day. We talked a lot about our gear and ways we thought we could go lighter, so I thought I would share a little bit of that. Right now I plan to ditch some things at the next hiker box opportunity or in Hanover. I think I will send home my camp crocs. I haven’t really been using them and I can live without them. I will also get rid of my spare lighter. I brought two bic mini lighters not knowing how long one would last. It’s lasted this long, so the full one will certainly make the rest of the journey. My Nu Skin - this was great in the winter when my skin would crack with the cold, but I haven’t used it in a long time. My pot cozy. I hardly cook in my pot at all, and now that it is warm I don’t need the cozy. There are probably a few other odds and ends I will find that I can do without. Why would I bother with this now? One reason is that I want to get as light as possible before the Whites. I’m expecting the climbs to be quite tough, and the less weight I carry the more fun the hiking is on those tough ascents and descents. I also feel like it is a good time to stretch myself a bit. Lighter is always better, and at this stage of the trip I won’t suffer for too long if I get rid of something I later wish I had. It’s a good time to experiment.
Gear wise, I’m still loving my Z Packs Arc Haul pack, I still use the same water system, I still have my 20 degree Western Mountaineering down bag, the Thermarest neo air pad, and my rain jacket and rain pants. I will be keeping all of that. I actually still have my winter gloves too. I’m considering getting rid of those, but they could still come in handy and they are really light, so I’m not sure yet. I have a new Sawyer filter shipping to Hanover. The flow rate in mine is super light and back flushing doesn’t help so I think it is about dead. I also ordered a new pair of shoes to Hanover. I don’t think I’ll need them yet, but I’m interested in trying the new Altra Olympus 3.0. It has more cushioning than my Lone Peak 3.5s. Having it shipped to Hanover allows me to try it on and see if I might like it. If yes, I will bounce it north. If no, I will return it and maybe get another pair of Lone Peaks and  have them sent north. Either way, I plan to hike the Whites in my Lone Peaks. It’s a responsive shoe and I get a good feel for what my feet are doing. I have well over 1000 miles using this shoe (two pair), so I don’t want to change right before some difficult hiking. At the same time, I don’t know if my current pair will make it to the end of my trek.
Lastly, at the shelter last night I met a German guy named Traveler (not the New Zealand Traveler I have mentioned before). He attempted a thru hike last year but didn’t finish, so he’s finishing the sections he missed this year. He was very interesting. Transformer and I spoke with him quite a bit. He knew very early that he did not want to walk the traditional line - school, corporate or stable boring job, etc. He and a friend left school and went to South America, and he has been traveling since. He’s been to so many places! He does camera and production work to make money when he needs it. He lives cheaply, like a backpacker but also like the locals live in the countries he visits. Simplicity and frugality have been an important part of this lifestyle. I really admired him and feel that he is living his dream. I also believe many people want to live that way, but ultimately are too scared to pull the trigger, or too sucked into the life picture that society has painted for them. I know that for a long time, I did things just because I thought it was what I should do. Anyway, it was good for Transformer to hear his experiences as well. Transformer is 31, from Australia, and has a degree in mining engineering. He had a desk job but hated it, so he started working in the mines. He liked the physical aspect of it, but it was mind numbing, repetitive, and dangerous work. He decided to completely change his life and work only to live an adventurous life. He quit, sold everything, and came to walk the AT. After this he is going to work in Canada for a few years at a ski resort. 
I was grateful today for the wildlife, the views, meeting interesting people, and good conversation. No moose sightings yet! We have been seeing what people say is moose poop, but not the culprits! Cell reception is getting worse. No signal tonight....","Goddard Shelter

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594368,"The shelter spacing in Vermont is pretty awesome. Not only are there a lot of shelters, but there is also almost always a 20 mile and 25 mile option. It’s hard to go 10 miles without seeing a shelter in Vermont, and often there is one every 5 miles or so. This provides lots of options for camping, but also for little breaks throughout the day to break things up a bit.
It was windy last night. All I could think about was the big dead tree I tented next to! In the morning I hiked out of camp first and hadn’t gone a quarter mile when I ran into Bones. I hadn’t seen him since the Shenandoahs (I think). Who was he hiking with but Pritch! Rewind to the days after the Nolichucky gorge in TN and right before Damascus, and I hiked a bit with Pritch and Starbucks, around the time I met Nate (Day Hiker). Pritch and Bones were heading into town to stay at a hostel. Apparently Starbucks is back south, though I must have passed him when he was in town or at a shelter I didn’t stop in because I never saw him. 
After chatting a bit and hiking down to look at a view of Manchester Center below, I hiked on and left them behind. I realized today that I have become a fairly strong and fast hiker! There are plenty of hikers that would leave me in the dust, but I’m quite grateful and surprised by how far I’ve come. I don’t sweat the 20 mile days anymore - I quite like them. I start early and have lots of time for breaks and views and whatnot, and I get into camp pretty early. My agility has improved significantly, and as painful as it was, I think PA had a lot to do with that. It really helps me move forward with confidence, which has increased my speed. I’m definitely not rushing, but my speed and stamina have significantly increased, which of course I like! The trail in Vermont has been a nice balance of rock and soil, climbs and flatter sections.
Transformer caught up to me as I hiked up Spruce peak, and we hiked the steep and rocky descent to the road crossing for Manchester Center together. Something happened to me on that descent. We got to the parking lot and I felt completely drained, almost like I was coming down with a cold or stomach bug. We sat in the parking lot and had some water, and a guy who was there offered us ding dongs. Even though I wasn’t feeling well, I ate the free ding dong. That’s what Hungry Cat does!! It have me a sugar rush and we climbed up to the nearby Bromley Shelter. I felt drained, so I laid down in the shelter and took a short siesta, probably for about 20 minutes. When I woke up, I felt back to normal again. It’s possible I just didn’t sleep well last night. We hiked on and I felt great - whew! 
We hiked up to the top of Bromley Mountain where there is a ski lift and different ski routes, as well as a ski patrol Hut. It is so weird to see ski areas when there is no snow! They had mist wands strategically placed to make snow in the winter. The ski lift station itself looked like some kind of alien pod. I took a picture of it. Everything was, of course, deserted, so we had a snack and rested there and then pushed on. We hiked up Styles Peak and then Peru Peak before passing Griffith Lake. Vermont really has some nice lakes/ponds that just sort of appear out of the woods. They are quite beautiful with their fir tree-lined banks. We called it a day at Lost Pond Shelter, where we saw Reboot again. As we ate at the shelter, a young hiker named Green Grass from the UK showed up. He blew past me in the Shenandoahs, but then took some time off trail. He usually walks 30-35 miles per day...quite fast! We talked with him a bit about gear before he pushed on - he is definitely hiking ultralight!
I was grateful for the good company today, the cooperative weather, the beautiful pond and that I was able to feel better after a short siesta. It is supposed to rain tonight, so maybe tomorrow we will see some of the Vermont mud people talk about. Thus far we have been lucky with the weather!","Stealth Campsite at mile 1646
",Lost Pond Shelter,"Jun 13, Wed",20.60
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594369,"Today I woke at about quarter to six, which is late for me. It stormed last night and rained pretty hard, but it stopped early in the morning as the wind picked up, so my rain fly and tent were mostly dry. Transformer and I got off to a late start. We knew we didn’t have to walk that many miles today, so we sat for a bit at the shelter talking about a plan to get through the Whites. Neither of us wants to spend the money to stay in huts. We also don’t want to be carrying large amounts of food for the climbs and descents we will have to endure. Resupply seems a little tricky in the Whites because surrounding towns seem to be at least hitching distance away. So far we seem to have a plan that gets us over Mt. Moosilaukee with only carrying half a day of food, which is great. We’ll figure the rest out later. Short term, our plan is to hike into Killington tomorrow, take the bus into Rutland and stay at the donation-based Yellow Deli hostel. I guess it is run by some kind of cult, so it sounds like an interesting trail experience. It will be cheap and is super convenient for resupply, and we can shower and do laundry there, which is great! We’ll just have to avoid the koolaid!
We hiked out together today and the conversation made the day go by quickly. Today was a “weird bird” day. We were walking along and this “thing” came flopping out of the thick underbrush towards me. It then changed course and ran north parallel to the AT and flopped out of the woods onto the trail in front of Transformer. It looked like some kind of pheasant. It was flapping its wings but not flying - just running and flopping around. It was odd. Then, a bit later a baby blue jay flutter flopped across the trail in front of us. It was crying and we could hear, and then see, its parents calling for it and following it. We left quickly to avoid getting dive-bombed and frightening it further. Hopefully it hadn’t fallen from a nest and could actually fly. 
We climbed yet another Bear Mountain. There was one in New York right before the Hudson  and one in Connecticut right after Salisbury. Before descending into the Clarendon gorge there was a nice view, albeit the Rutland airport caulked the view up a little bit. The Clarendon gorge had a suspension bridge over the Mill River, which was flowing rapidly, pregnant from the recent rain. It was a cool little gorge, and suspension bridges are always a little thrilling!
From here we walked up to the VT103 road crossing. AWOL says there is a restaurant 0.5 miles west. I mapped it with Google and it is actually 0.9 miles west, but it was only about 3pm and only one more mile to the shelter, so Transformer and I decided to go. The restaurant is really a deli - Loretta’s Good Food and Deli - and has all kinds of sandwiches, sides, baked goods, resupply items, coffee, and Ben and Jerry’s pints! I got a Reuben, a side of Greek pasta, a bag of black truffle flavored chips, a raspberry bar, a pint of The Tonight Dough ice cream, and two large coffees. I first had the Tonight Dough flavor at Mountain Harbour Inn back in TN, and having it again brought back good trail memories. Also, it’s the best flavor!!  I also packed out another bag of chips. I’m sure I pounded down about 3500 calories there! We used the time to charge our phones and further strategize on resupply in the Whites. We have a tentative plan that will probably be over aggressive and need modification, but it’s a first draft. I wish the huts there had resupply foods like the waysides in the Shenandoahs. That would make things a lot easier. No matter - we will rise to the challenge! A nice man offered us a ride back to the trail head in the back of his truck. Riding in the truck bed with the wind blowing in my hair felt like true freedom!
We hiked into Clarendon Shelter and again, I have no signal. I guess I can paint these all from Rutland. I was grateful for a good day of hiking, the weather holding out during the day, the deli, and yet again the kindness of a stranger. It was a good day. It is supposed to rain again tonight and tomorrow morning. I’m tenting again though - it’s nice to have the privacy and not have to deal with the bugs! I listened to bird song tonight. There is one bird (I don’t know what kind it is) that I hear in the evenings all the time. I heard it tonight, and so I recorded a little bit of its song if you are interested in hearing it: https://youtu.be/6kKWQDJfEt8.","Lost Pond Shelter
",Clarendon Shelter ,"Jun 14, Thu",18.60
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594370,"It was raining this morning, but we got up early anyway to try and hit the trail asap. I think we were all keen to get to Killington. Transformer and I were going to stay at the Yellow Deli hostel, and Reboot and Milo (a section hiker Reboot has been hiking with), who slept in the shelter last night, were keen to get to the Inn at Long Trail.
It was wet and chilly hiking to start, but an immediate steep ascent up Beacon Hill had me stripping off my rain jacket quickly. I hiked on at a fast pace in just shorts and a t shirt. This is how I hike pretty much every day. It really has to be cold for me to hike in, say, pants. About mid morning Transformer and I reached a side trail (after 4 miles of climbing) to the summit of Mt. Killington, Vermont’s second tallest peak and the tallest in Vermont on the AT. We wanted to summit it even though we knew the view would be a complete white out, just to say we’d summited. It was a steep and rocky 0.2 miles to the top. We took a selfie at the top since there was no view. It’s a shame because I bet the view is amazing normally.
We picked our way down the side trail and back to the AT, going slowly as the grade was very steep and the rocks wet and slippery. We took a short break at a shelter there and then continued north. All around was the smell of Christmas trees and damp earth. We hiked pretty hard. Our plan was to hike to the Sherburne Pass Trail and take that half a mile to The Inn at Long Trail. From in front of the Inn we could flag down a bus and get to Rutland for 2 bucks. The Rutland bus station is right by the Yellow Deli Hostel. We could then have our cult experience! I got to the Inn first and chatted with an employee there. Transformer arrived in short order. We were pretty hungry, so we decided to go in and have some food. The Inn itself is really nice. They have an Irish pub there and a place for live music. I ordered a burger, a cup of clam chowder, and a cup of coffee. I topped that off with a root beer float and a massive plate of nachos. We watched a little World Cup as Ronaldo helped Portugal avoid a come-from-behind loss to Spain. We chatted with Reboot and Milo after they got there, and then ran out to catch the bus. 
The bus got us to Rutland in no time and stopped right outside the Yellow Deli. Someone from the hostel came out to meet us and took us inside to show us the ropes. I wasn’t sure what to expect. It’s a donation-based hostel run by some kind of cult, so I sort of pictured a bit of a chaotic scene, but it was actually really nice and quite clean. They had free laundry, loaner clothes, showers with soap, bunks with clean sheets, lots of bunks and a nice common area and back deck. It was pretty awesome, and so far no one has tried to convert me or get me to join. It feels very unculty.I set to getting myself and my laundry clean. Once that was done, I laid out my wet gear to dry, shook down my pack to get rid of some weight and added items to their hiker box, went to Walmart to resupply, grabbed Subway on the way back and ate it on the back deck with Transformer. I felt very efficient! 
Tomorrow I will eat breakfast at the hostel. It is supposed to be very good! I’m excited about that. I think Transformer will zero here tomorrow. I plan to push on, catch the bus back to Killington, and hike. I suspect he will catch up to me before, or in, the Whites. 
I was grateful for the cool temperature today, the good companionship and good food, and for the great hostel to stay at. It was a great day in Vermont!","Clarendon Shelter 
",Sherburne Pass Trail at Mile 1703.8,"Jun 15, Fri",18.60
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594441,"I had a good sleep at the hostel last night despite some street noise and lights (I was right by a window overlooking the street). The sun comes up early and I’m used to waking with it. I had hoped to sleep until 7, but I woke at 5:30 and then dozed until 6/6:30. Breakfast was at 7:30 and I had heard it was awesome, but today was the cult’s sabbath I guess and they don’t cook on the sabbath. That said, they fed us some amazing granola, coffee, and gave us a banana. The granola was seriously awesome and I was grateful to have it. I’ll probably crave it tomorrow.... They also had a little bit of Vermont maple syrup for us to put on the granola - that was a real treat! If I could and had the supply, i would probably put Vermont maple syrup on everything, or just drink it like Elf. I feel kind of bad calling the Yellow Deli folks a “cult” as it has negative connotations. They were super nice and didn’t try and push any doctrines on us at all. They were really just cool about helping hikers - that was my experience anyway. I can only recommend  the hostel - no complaints. I guess I use the word “cult” because it makes the experience sound a bit more edgy, or like a check box kind of thing, but I don’t pretend to have done any research whatsoever into their beliefs. As long as they are happy and peaceful, I don’t really care!! Maybe “spiritual community” is a better phrase. One last detail: Transformer found some women’s multivitamins and I took one. I figured it was probably a good idea and one vitamin wouldn’t turn me into a woman. 
After breakfast I got my gear together and said my “see you down the trail” to Transformer. He decided to zero and take a rest day. I’m pretty sure I will see him again in the Whites! I headed down to the bus stop with Dude, who was also leaving.  
The bus dropped Dude about 1.3 miles south of me as he had hitched into town from a road crossing. I got off at the Inn at Long Trail, where I had to walk the 0.5 mile Sherburne Pass trail back to the AT. Before I did, I called my Dad to wish him a happy Father’s Day, just in case I don’t have a cell signal tomorrow. I caught up with the folks a little bit and we talked about the trip. It’s weird sometimes being removed from the day to day. Life goes on while I walk through the woods.... 
The hiking today was full of hills. Initially, I walked through Gifford State Park. It was kind of funny because the trail goes straight down a dirt road where people can car camp. I walked by lots of families with their cars and tents, like some kind of misplaced hobo passing by. I could smell things grilling - I wanted those things. In my fantasies, delicious charred meats were being devoured by the unworthy and I had to save them, to give them the martyrdom they craved by allowing them to save me via my digestive tract. Alas, I could only walk by the smells.
I walked by beautiful Kent Pond. Vermont has some gorgeous lakes. They call them “ponds,” but in the south a pond  carries the connotation of something small and likely to be a water source for horses on a small farm. The ponds in Vermont are five or ten times the size of what we call ponds in the south. In summary for my southern friends, in Yankee speak, ponds = really attractive and quaint lakes that appear in the woods out of nowhere, and that you might actually consider swimming in.
After Kent Pond I walked by breathtaking Thundering Falls, and then spent the rest of the day climbing quite a bit - good practice for the Whites! The weather today was really pleasant under the green tunnel! One wildlife observation - I haven’t been seeing grey squirrels anymore. They were ubiquitous farther south, but now all I see are the usual chipmunks, and then an occasional brownish squirrel. The brown squirrels seem much more skittish and I have only seen a few. 
I’m getting close to New Hampshire! That’s pretty exciting. I’m excited to still be in Vermont as well. I thought I would check in a bit because I know some of my entries probably seem a bit hurried or short. I’m still really into the hiking and the hike. Yes, there are days that are harder than others or where I think to myself “ok, I could be done now,” but largely I’m just grateful to still be going and still taking it all in, day by day. I still wake up some days and think “wow! I’m actually doing this! I’m thru hiking the AT!” Some days it’s just what I do, and other days I can’t believe I’m doing it. Sometimes I can’t believe I’ve made it so far north! It feels like I blinked my eyes and got to Vermont. I’m definitely into a routine now. I get up at 5, hit the trail at 6/6:15, walk 10-12 hours, make camp, socialize and eat, then try to stay awake long enough to journal. I like my routine though. I enjoy waking with first light. I like going to bed as early as I can get my stuff done. I listen to owls and birds as I go to sleep. It’s a good life out here on the trail! I don’t have to deal with news or jobs or traffic. A pheasant was walking around my tent earlier and then flapping its wings as it settled down in the nearby leaves. That’s the big evening news here! Anyway, I just thought I’d check in to say that while the trail experience is not new anymore, I still love it and am having a blast. I wish I could convey what my days are really like - taking in the special smell of the grasses as I move from forest to meadow, watching chipmunks so obsessed with chasing each other that they run right by my feet, feeling the temperature change as I drop into mossy creek beds, listening to water I can’t see because the spring is beneath rocks. All of these things are so special to me. I know I will miss them dearly when the hike is over. Right now I miss my wife and kitty. I will see them soon though, when I can tell Lucy stories of all the chipmunks in the woods she could chase....
I was grateful for the hostel last night and the great breakfast this morning, as well as the beautiful weather today. Tomorrow is supposed to be nice, and hot! It will be interesting to see how/if the Vermont scenery changes as I move north. Lucky to have a fleeting mobile signal tonight. Let’s see if it’s good enough to post this....

",Winturri Shelter,"Jun 16, Sat",18
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594623,"My sleep at Winturri Shelter was good. I shared my little tent clearing in the woods with a partridge. It strutted around outside my tent and then walked about 10 feet away to settle down. It thumped its wings up and down, sounding very much like a helicopter. It did this a few times, and I rolled around on my air mattress, and then we both went to sleep.
I got on the trail about 20 past six, but before I did I checked my guest book with the little faint signal that I had. Brian had left me a note about being at Thistle Hill Shelter around lunch time, so I made a mental note to stop in. It was time to hike!
The morning was pretty and the scenery varied. It went from hemlock forest to hilly meadow and back. I joked with Dude later on when he caught up to me that it was like Vermont put a new twist on things we had already experienced. Walking through a wet meadow pasture where the grass is overgrown and get your legs and feet pretty soaked - we’ve done that, but Vermont puts the pasture on the side of a mountain, so it’s uphill as well! Dude caught up to me at a particularly pretty part of the trail. I popped out of the forest and was in just this gradual descending meadow with some sparse trees in it. It was almost Apple orchardy feeling. We pushed on, and after a bit Dude was gone and I was hiking solo again. I was looking to hike about 12 miles by noon so that my afternoon would be fairly easy.
As I came up on the Thistle Hill Shelter turn off, I saw a sign in the dirt with sticks pointing towards the shelter that said “Magic>>.” I walked down the spur trail and when I arrived Dude was in the shelter, as well as a man and a woman, and there was a section hiker sitting near a hammock. The man and the woman were Brian and his wife Jill. They had been reading this journal and decided to do a little magic for me and other hikers as well as come meet me! It was pretty amazing that someone would do this. Well, let me back up - I still can’t believe anyone reads this! On top of that, that someone both reads my ramblings and still wants to meet me - that’s a bloody miracle! We chatted for a bit and then they started producing treat after treat. It was incredible! They had little Debbie cake honey buns and cosmic brownies, a special deli sandwich they had brought just for me from their local deli, chocolate graham crackers, power aids - they had even hiked another 0.2 miles down to the water source and brought back water for us so we wouldn’t have to walk down to get it! They had a trash bag for us to empty out our trash, but this was not the Creme de la creme.... In ancient China Emperor Qin Shi Huang had an army of terra cotta warriors created for his own eventual burial. When it was all almost done, he said: “Wait. There is only one thing that can get me safely through to the afterlife.” He then requested a jar of Jif  Maple and ensured his god status would come true. That’s right - Brian and Jill actually brought a jar of Jif Maple a snickers bar to dip in it! I was in heaven. Dude had never tried Jif Maple. He really enjoyed it as well. It was like being a kid at Christmas - all of my food fantasies came true as I sat there on the side of the shelter with black carpenter ants slowly making their way onto my body. There were a lot of them where I was sitting. I put Jif Maple on the graham crackers, the cosmic brownies, and of course, the snickers. It was a trailside bacchanalia!
We all sat and talked while we ate. I got a lot of good info on the Whites that made me feel a lot more mentally prepared. It was also fun talking with the section hiker, Sun, who started in MA and just kept going. I was incredibly grateful for all of the thought and effort Brian and Jill put into the trail magic - it really was amazing and very effective at getting me re-energized and pumped about the upcoming Whites! They even sent me off with the rest of the Jif Maple (thanks guys!!). We took a picture together. Dude photobombed one and I found it pretty funny so I used it for the entry, but I posted the other “normal” one as well. The trail always seems to provide what you need when you need it. I continue to be amazed by the kindness and generosity of strangers. 
Dude and I hiked out of the shelter with full bellies, headed for the White River. There was said to be good swimming there. As we hiked over a hill we passed a bench that had “relax and enjoy” carved in it. It appeared to be under some kind of fruit tree. There was a pretty view off in the distance. I think this is quintessential Vermont hiking. We also passed what Brian and Jill had said were maple tree taps. There were a bunch of small plastic tubes that fed into a larger plastic tube that carried sap down the mountain. It was quite interesting looking.
When we got to the river, it was beautiful and clear. There were a good handful of people swimming. Dude and I were pondering the same dilemma. Ideally we wanted to skinny dip so as not to get our hiking clothes wet. There were too many people and the water was too translucent though, so we opted not to swim. Some people were jumping off the bridge over the river into the water. Not me!
We kept hiking to Happy Hill Shelter and when we got there were told by some section hikers that the water source was dry. We decided to look anyway, so Dude and I followed the dry creek bed upstream until we shortly found some puddles, and then a tiny bit of flow. As we bent down to gather water, clouds of mosquitos surrounded us, dying for a taste of that Jif Maple blood. We got the water we needed, but in the end wished we had just carried some in from the last source on the trail a few miles back. At camp, I met a hiker named Dusty Pilgrim. He’s also a Nobo and this was my first time meeting him. He left GA in March. At camp, he was wearing his crocs and a stick went up through the bottom and broke off inside his foot! OUCH!! He is going to get it cleaned out in Hanover tomorrow. 
I was so grateful today for the kindness of others, the trail magic, the ability to experience that with other hikers, and the chance to gain some more confidence for the Whites. What an awesome day, and tomorrow I will be in New Hampshire!

",Happy Hill Shelter ,"Jun 17, Sun",21.10
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594718,"When I woke I could see the mosquitos waiting for me outside my tent. I had to pee pretty badly, but I didn’t want to get eaten alive, so I kneeled in my vestibule, popped my torso out of the tent, and let it fly while waiving one hand around my head to fend off the waiting horde. This actually worked pretty well, and I succeeded without any spillage. One mosquito got in the tent, so I had to find it and kill it, of course.
I got ready to go pretty quickly. I was keen to get into Hanover, or Ivy Town as I like to call it, so I could do all my business there as well as eat and chill out somewhere for a while, charge my phone and battery pack, etc. The trail goes right through Norwich, VT on the way into Hanover, and there is quite a bit of road walking. The neighborhood on the outskirts of Norwich was awesome. It was beautiful with cottagey-looking houses, and several of the houses had coolers with trail magic at the end of their driveways. I stopped at one and drank a coke. I should have stopped at the second one, but didn’t. I later found out it had banana bread.... 
I walked in through the Norwich community green, stopping to chat with a lady who was walking a very excited puppy only a few months old. I then walked under the I91 overpass and crossed the Connecticut River into New Hampshire. Just like that, beautiful Vermont became memories and I entered the next to the last state on my journey.  I reflected on this as I walked along. New Hampshire and Maine have been two of the states I’ve been looking forward to the most. I have a vision of them being, or at least feeling, more remote, wild and free. One of the reasons I wanted to thru hike was also to feel more wild and free. I really had no idea at the outset just how possible that was going to be. I didn’t know that I would feel and experience a pure freedom, that I would be able to shake loose the shackles of conventional ways of living, of the way I was living. I will be leaning on New Hampshire and Maine to give me my final lessons, to help me come away from the trail with something more than just an ephemeral notion, something more akin to a complete metamorphosis of thought. I hope the trail can free me from myself forever, so that I remain wild and free and not slip back into the patterns of my past and the conventions of society that have stifled my true human nature. 
I thought of these things as I walked past the Dartmouth green and into Ivy Town, but mostly I thought of getting my post office chores done ASAP so I could eat! As I walked down the main drag I passed Lou’s Bakery. A girl standing outside asked if I was a thru hiker. When I said yes, she gave me a free donut! It was a big maple donut. I thanked her and shoved it in my mouth like a heathen. At the post office I had three packages - a new Sawyer filter, a new pair of shoes, and some Canadian chocolate trail magic from Whitewater that she had sent a while back. It was an amazing stash of Canada’s finest and she wrote me a little note along with it - super cool, or as she would say in Canadian speak, “it’s a banger!” I wish she were still on the trail.
The shoes are the Altra Olympus 3.0 and I think the sizing was right, though ideally I could try one half size smaller. Anyway, I bumped those to Caratunk, ME in case I can’t quite finish the trail in my Lone Peaks. I also sent a few things homethat I can do without to lighten my load, including my camp shoes that I haven’t really been using. Dude texted me and said he was with Rivers, Gandalf, and a few others at Lou’s having breakfast. I was excited about this as I hadn’t seen Rivers since Damascus, and I had never met Gandalf. Gandalf was so far ahead of me for so long, but I would always read his log entries and he would always draw a pipe in them. I guess he smokes a pipe. I went over to Lou’s to see.
They had finished eating, but I did catch up with Rivers and a guy Snuggs, as well as met Gandalf, Zoom Zoom, and a British guy named Mumbles. I had just bumped into another Hiker named Green Grass, also from the UK. For whatever reason, meeting Gandalf met something to me. I had been reading his logbook entries for so long, it was almost like he was a trail legend, always elusively ahead of me. He didn’t look at all like what I expected. He definitely didn’t have a Gandalf beard! They were all heading out, so I sat at the breakfast counter diner style to eat. I got a breakfast quesadilla and coffee. The food was delicious, and I had been craving a breakfast burrito, so this was close. I talked to a Dartmouth kid who sat next to me for a while. He was quite sociable and friendly. After the food, I heading onward and saw Dude’s pack outside a Starbucks. I stopped in to say hi and also to charge my electronics for a bit. Starbucks is always good for outlets and WiFi....
After a bit, I walked through town on the trail to the grocery coop and handled my resupply. I drank some Vermont apple cider there, then started my hike out of town. It was hot in the mid 80s and you could cut the humidity with a knife. It was at the point where it needed to rain. And rain it did. It rained on my walk in, and after that first rain the humidity was still hanging on strong. I set up my tent at Moose Mountain Shelter and then proceeded to get my rock sack to hang my food line stuck in a tree. Sadly, I had to cut my line and leave it in the tree.... I went up to the shelter to eat and Gandalf, Green Grass, Snuggs, and a Hiker named Vinegar were there. We chatted for a bit. I retired to my tent just before the big storms started sweeping through. It rained heavily at night and I knew it would be a soggy morning pack up. 
I was grateful for the kindness of strangers and the community of the trail today, as well as the great city of Hanover and all its charms and conveniences. The weather is supposed to be better tomorrow!","Happy Hill Shelter 
",Moose Mountain Shelter,"Jun 18, Mon",16.80
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594723,"Today I got what I am now calling The New Hampshire Package: weather changes, trail magic, wildlife and views! The rain had stopped this morning and reduced to fog, but a gusty wind moved in and pushed out the fog. I got off to a later start, just because everything was damp and my tent was pretty wet. My clothes were still wet as well, but everything would dry today in the nicer weather.
I hiked down from Moose Mountain and hit a road crossing with trail magic! A note on a cooler said Brian and Jill - the dynamic duo had struck again!! I pulled a poweraid out of the cooler and drank it, grateful for the electrolytes. Those two are pretty
amazing! 
Later in the morning I stopped at Grafton Turnpike road crossing to dry my tent out in the sun and have a snack. I spread my tent out in a few concrete structures that were there, then sat down to eat a cliff bar. I heard something moving around, and all of a sudden a bear comes walking out of the woods, about 15 feet from me, and about 6 feet from my open bag where my food bag is on top. The bear stared at me! I was shocked and wanted a picture, but this was a dicey situation. Any time a bear comes up that close it means it isn’t really afraid, which is not good. I picked up my one trekking pole (the other was over by the bear with my tent footprint on it). And stood up and started making noise - not too aggressive but definitely “go away” noise. The bear looked at me and then skillfully walked down the embankment and across the stream below. Before I could recover, ANOTHER bear cane out of the woods right behind the other! I was in disbelief. This bear had some kind of collar on. Fortunately it just followed the first bear, crisis averted! Now that I and my food were safe, I did a little dance of joy. My AT bear experience just got completely rounded out!! I had only seen the one bear running away in New Jersey. The New Hampshire bears wanted to have a tea party with me!
Powered by excitement, I hiked up Smarts Mountain, stopping to enjoy lovely views on Lambert’s Ridge. I climbed up the fire tower at the top and got amazing views in all directions, including what I think was a view of Moosilaukee. There was a guy up in the fire tower who was out hiking for the day and he offered me a few of his snacks, which was super nice. 
I trotted off and almost ran into a huge porcupine in the middle of the trail! It turned its back to me and put its quills up, so I backed up and waited. Eventually it shuffled along. It had the biggest rack of quills out of the porcupines I have seen yet! On my way north I also saw a few garter snakes.
The hiking was challenging today. I arrived at the shelter starving and ready to eat. The climbs are getting steeper, but the views are getting better! I was so grateful for the weather, the magic, and the animal sightings/encounters today, not to mention the views and the kindness of strangers. I can’t wait to see what tomorrow brings!","Moose Mountain Shelter
",Hexacuba Shelter,"Jun 19, Tue",17.70
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595248,"Some days I feel like I’m just as tired after 15 miles as I am after 20. It’s funny how that works. Today I ended the day thinking I’d walked 19, not having done the math in my plan for a few days. Ah well - in the end it worked out well to have lighter days before the big climbs start tomorrow.
It was only me at Hexacuba Shelter last night, though I still tented. The tent sites there are few and not great, but I made one of them work just fine. I got up early and started my climb up Mt. Cube. The views waiting for me at the top were phenomenal! I loved the initial “approach” views on the Quartzite Ledges, and then the buildup at the southern peak. I took photos there and hung out for a bit, just taking it in. It was kind of cool to have it all to myself in the early morning, and it really put me in good spirits. I was gushing with trail love! As I walked away from the south peak, I came upon a large hare. He had huge hind legs and looked at me both curiously and somewhat with fear. I was able to take a picture of him before he hopped away. I then took a side trail off the AT to go check out the north peak. It was 0.3 miles one way, but totally worth it for more spectacular views. The quartz rock on the peak almost looked sophisticated in the morning sun, so smooth with an occasional sparkle.
Aside from those views, the other big highlight today was meeting Carl the Omelette Guy. When I arrived at the Cape Moonshine Road crossing, Carl was there with his truck. Carl is a Trail Angel and regularly sets up in that spot to provide a little oasis in the desert for hikers. He had a little music playing, a place to charge my phone, and FOOD! I was seriously hungry at that point, but trying to backload my calories so I would feel as good as possible tackling Moosilauke. Carl offered to make me an omelette, and I don’t know how many eggs he put in it, but it was something like 6! He chopped up onions and peppers and added cheese. He even had Tabasco sauce! The icing on the cake was that he put big chunks of ham in the omelette - yum! He had lots of other snacks and bananas, and he also had Dunkin Donuts. I had a donut and my eyes rolled back into my head. Mmmmmmmm sooooo gooooood! The omelette was incredible and I almost wanted to cuddle it - almost.... Instead I just ate it like a pig while petting Carl’s dog, Lips. I probably sat there for an hour just chatting with Carl. We talked about all sorts of things - the trail, animals, other hikers, and I just kind of enjoyed having good conversation. Carl is a really interesting and kind person, and I couldn’t have been more lucky and humbled by his kindness and generosity. I really feel like he gave me that last push I needed before Moosilauke. One last thing - he has awesome taste in music! I don’t hike listening to music, so it was really nice to have it in the background while we talked. It was all 70s and 80s, like David Bowie, Journey, and even Billy Joel! It was a real treat. Carl, thank you so much for today - I had an absolute blast!
Between Carl and Brian and Jill, and with all of the awesome scenery this far, AND the BEARS, I’m kind of crushing on New Hampshire at the moment. I met a couple of nice section hikers at the shelter tonight - two guys, Isaac and Tim, Tufts alumni - but, prior to them, I thought I might be the only one at this shelter tonight. I was grateful for a good solid day of hiking today, for the awesomeness that was Mt. Cube, and for Carl and his generosity and willingness to chat with me today. It was an awesome day thanks to other people and the mountains around me. I’m very excited about Moosilauke tomorrow! I also realized I have been spelling it wrong with two “e’s,” so I fixed that here. No signal here so will have to upload later. Time for an early night!","Hexacuba Shelter
",Jeffers Brook Shelter,"Jun 20, Wed",15.70
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595249,"I woke up early at Jeffers Brook, before 5, but snoozed and so I really just started moving a few minutes before 5. Last night no had talked with two cool section hikers who were moving southbound. They were Tufts University alumni and new some of the folks working at the huts. They said they would write me notes to hand to their friends at the huts to take care of me, whatever that might mean. Maybe a bit of food, or a floor to sleep on! Either way, it was super cool of them, and I was kind of excited about getting to deliver a “hello how are ya” note on the trail. I felt like some kind of mountain courier. They had left the notes for me under a water bottle, so I quietly grabbed them as I prepared to head out. I have this funny camp thing - no matter what time I get up, I can’t get on the trail until a few minutes past 6. I could probably get up at 2am and it would take me 4 hours and 15 minutes to hit the trail. Today was no different - I started hiking at 6:15. 
Today was a big day. I would climb Moosilauke, resupply in Lincoln, and end up somewhere depending on how long that all took. I was very excited walking along. I wasn’t sure what to expect of the scenery on the Whites. I wasn’t sure how Moosilauke would be. It was a good excitement though. I had planned my last food supply well after Transformer and I poured over the book and miles to see how we could keep ourselves light for the Moose. I had about a heavy half day of food and I had eaten a good calorie-rich breakfast. I was carrying a little less than a liter of water. I felt strong and agile on my feet. This was going to be good! And it was. The climb up was steep but not that bad. It was normal hiking steep - I didn’t have to take my pack off or do any bouldering. The trip down the mountain on the north side was steeper. This was the piece I was most concerned about. But, I think it had become something so crazy in my head that when I actually hiked it, I thought “oh...ok. This isn’t bad at all.” It wasn’t bad. I just took all of the advice - I went slowly, stayed on the path, paid careful attention to the wet rock, etc. in my head I was going to be hanging off a cliff with one hand while swinging to an anchor point, something like Sylvester Stallone in that movie “Cliffhanger.” In reality, it was just a steep, rocky hike. That was all good stuff and a real confidence booster! What wasn’t ideal was that as I climbed up the Moose, the fog and wind rolled in. Today was an absolutely gorgeous day, except for when I was on the Moosilauke summit. I got up there and went to the south peak first. I saw two rabbits and a whole lotta grey. I then continued to the summit, where the winds were probably gusting at 25-30 mph and just blowing fog across the mountain into a grey abyss. I had to put my rain jacket on to keep warm, and water dripped from my beard where moisture from the fog was collecting. After all the buildup, I was really hoping for an awesome view. That said, the trail always gives me what I need when I need it, and so I have to trust in that. Maybe I needed one last reminder of how fast weather can change here. Maybe I needed to be reminded that nature doesn’t care about my plans; that I am insignificant. Or maybe I just needed to remember that sometimes just doing something I’m nervous about is enough of a win. I did get some nice views through the trees going down the north side of the Moose, especially along a long cascading waterfall beside the trail. 
I was elated when I got to Kinsman Notch. I got there at about 11am, filtered some water at a brook just before the parking area, and ate the last coffee crisp Whotewater had sent me from Canada. Nom nom nom those things are good! At the parking lot I went up by the road and stuck my thumb out to get a ride into Lincoln. An older gentleman named Kevin pulled up and offered me a ride. Kevin was a shop teacher at a nearby high school. He had two little dogs in the car, which were barking at me. One little wire haired dog was named Otis, and he quickly took a shining to me. Kevin was pretty funny. He said “sometimes I regret picking up hikers because they stink SO BADLY! Especially when it’s wet out. I mean, I get it, but then I gotta go have the upholstery in my car cleaned.” I laughed and told him I was glad I made the cut. He’s right though - sometimes we do smell pretty dang awful!
Kevin wished me luck and dropped me at Price Chopper. I thanked him profusely, handled my resupply and bought a sandwich as well. I sat outside and ate the sandwich. As I finished, a skinny hiker walked up and introduced himself as Fat Tony. He is a flip flopper and Carl had mentioned him yesterday. He was resupplying as well. 
I walked back out to the road to try and hitch back. A few people stopped, but they were going to other places away from the trailhead. Still, I was impressed at how many stopped. At one point I had my thumb out as a state trooper drove by. Fortunately he did not stop and give Me a ticket! As I walked and thumbed I came across an ice cream stand. I definitely needed some soft serve! As I sat eating, an older gentleman approached and asked if I was hiking through. I said yes and he asked me where I was going and if I wanted a lift. AWESOME! Their names were Paul and Joyce and they had just finished playing mini golf next door. They had both thru hiked together in 1998! They also have thru hiked the Vermont Long Trail, the Buckeye trail, and the American Discovery trail - pretty impressive! They were just the nicest and most supportive couple. They had lived in New Hampshire all of their lives and had very distinctive New Hampshire accents. It was unique sounding, though I guess I haven’t met many people from New Hampshire. I felt bad because we went to the wrong trailhead at first and had to drive back to Kinsman Notch, but they were not phased at all. I really liked them and hope that when we are that age, Gillian and I will have a rap sheet of adventures too! 
When they dropped me off at Kinsman, the two Tufts section hikers, Isaac and Tim (Taffy and Rook were their trail names, respectively), were trying to hitch into town. I watched as Paul and Joyce scooped them up and headed back to Lincoln. They are just incredible people! At this point I was feeling like a million dollars. Lincoln was a super cute town, I was excited about all of the great people I had met over the last few days, I was overflowing with gratitude for all of it, and I was totally excited about the Whites. I was ready to keep hiking! 
The climb out of Kinsman Notch was challenging with a fresh supply of food. I didn’t think New Hampshire had copperheads, but I walked up on a smaller one sunning itself on a rock in the trail. It moved off, fortunately. The hiking for the rest of the afternoon was what everyone says it will be - tough. Steep climbs, big step ups, and in a few places some seriously deep mud! It was gorgeous though. I climbed Mt. Wolf and got a view of Franconia Ridge to the north. It was almost 6:30 when I got to the shelter. It was a really nice setup - no one else was there! I still set up my tent, as I prefer to sleep in it. I made my dinner and have the place to myself tonight. Unfortunately I have no cell signal. 
What a day! I’m crushing so hard on New Hampshire right now! I can’t wait to see what tomorrow brings. I’ll see my first hut tomorrow and climb some big mountains. I was so grateful for this entire journey today, and for the important lessons it is teaching me. I was grateful for the wisdom and support of Kevin, Paul and Joyce. People like them and all of the other trail angels are like beacons on a broader journey. I am grateful for their light.","Jeffers Brook Shelter
",Eliza Brook Shelter,"Jun 21, Thu",15.90
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595250,"***i had to go back and edit this entry, though luckily I hadn’t posted it yet. Long story short, a hiker friend Choo Choo went missing and the police were looking for him, but I heard later that he has been found and is safe. Anyway, I had written about it and I was definitely feeling bummed on this day and kind of sick about it. I thought something really awful had happened to him. So glad it did not!!! I will now resume regular programming...***
I woke up early at Eliza Brook Shelter, the place still to myself. There was a nip in the air and I donned my jacket while I packed up camp and ate. The hike out was gorgeous, with numerous cascades and waterfalls running right alongside the trail. The weather today was supposed to be amazing, and so I was excited to hike. This early morning waterfall treat kicked things off nicely.
Today I quickly realized that Moosilauke was just a warmup. My first climb of the day was up Mt. Kinsman, and that was a much more difficult ascent. Some of it was just hand over hand bouldering. All of it was very steep. It was a good taste of the Whites! I think the climb up Kinsman really helped to set my expectations properly on the terrain I could expect. At the summit I talked with a couple of peak baggers, there for the day and because Kinsman is one of New Hampshire’s 4000 footers. The cairn at the summit had a funny throne-like indentation, so they took a picture of me sitting in it. Unlike yesterday on Moosilauke, the views today were breathtaking. This would basically be the theme for the rest of the day. 
After Kinsman I stopped in at my first hut, Lonesome Lake Hut. I had a message to deliver from one of the section hikers to a staff member there, and wanted to see what the huts were like. I was also hoping for some free food! The hut was big and pretty fancy for  being called a hut! It was set just above gorgeous Lonesome Lake, which was a classically beautiful mountain pond. I went in and gave the note to a crew member. They were really cool and gave me breakfast leftovers - eggs, oatmeal and a piece of bread and cake. I sat with them and talked with them while I ate. They were all quite young - college age.
After this I climbed down to Franconia Notch and then up again working my way to Franconia Ridge. The hiking through all of this was very rugged, with steep drops and steep climbs the whole way. I fully understood now why people say the Whites are tough. I was absolutely loving it! I liked the views, but I also liked the athletic challenge of it. I had a kind of “hiker’s high” for much of the day. The scenery and views were so good that it felt like my head was going to explode. On my way to Franconia Ridge I passed a 0.3 mile side trail to the Mt. Liberty summit. Despite the rough terrain and extra miles, I didn’t want to pass this up, so I went to see it. The summit had incredible 360 degree views of the surrounding mountains. It was like standing on top of the world! 
After Liberty I hiked back to the AT and continued the climb up to Franconia Ridge. The ridge itself was amazing and definitely a highlight of my AT experience so far! It is almost overwhelming it is so gorgeous, and I could see all around, 360 degrees, because the ridge is completely exposed and above tree line. As I walked along the ridge, I came first to the summit of Little Haystack Mountain, then to Mt. Lincoln (my first Presidential), and then finally up to Mt. LaFayette, the tallest on the ridge. I had absolutely perfect weather! Some of you reading this might think I was crazy to pack so much into one day, but I’m so glad I did because weather seems to be very volatile up here. 
I spent a lot of time up on the ridge, just taking it all in. I did the same at Kinsman and Liberty. I knew in those moments that these would be at the top of the list of my most cherished views from the trail. I had decided to go to Garfield Ridge Shelter, but I still had to descend Lafayette and then climb up and over Mt. Garfield. It was a beast of course, but I did it! I got to the shelter at around 7:30pm and was exhausted. It was a great feeling though - I actually think it was my best day hiking on the trail so far. I had a great day of views, felt good physically and mentally about my hike, and just felt at peace. I saw some other thru hikers at the shelter, ate my food and passed out! In one day I had summited the following: 
4K Peaks:
Kinsman 
Liberty 
Little Haystack
Garfield
5K peaks:
Lincoln 
Lafayette
I was grateful today for this journey I’m on, and for the wonderful and beautiful natural world we live in. I was grateful to have the ability and opportunity to hike to these summits and enjoy the views. It was a phenomenal day on the trail!","Eliza Brook Shelter
",Garfield Ridge Shelter,"Jun 22, Fri",19.10
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595251,"This morning was chilly. I thought a lot about Choo Choo and that weighed heavy on my mind. The hiking really helped to shake those unfounded scenarios running through my head though. (I left this because it was what I was thinking at the time, but obviously we now know he’s ok)
First stop was Galehead Hut. The crew there was great and gave us breakfast leftovers of eggs and pancakes! The weather was pretty iffy, and as I left the hut it started to rain. I summited Mt. Guyout, another 4K peak, and as the wind at the top blew rain into my face, I took a wrong turn and ended up walking close to a mile off on the wrong trail! When I figured it out, I had to climb back to the summit to get back to the AT.
Once back on track, things were good. Today was more rocky descents, only wetter. I went to Zealand Falls Hut and got some soup and a brownie there. Zoom zoom, Snuggs, Apollo and Skutch were there, as well as flip floppers Fat Tony and The Kid. A man and his daughter came by to ask us about thru hiking. She was sweet and offered us a bag of leftover snacks she had, which we happily divided up. The huts are cool places to chat with folks. We can always get water there, use the bathrooms, and so far they have been good about leftovers. I had to pay to camp at Garfield last night. It was ten bucks, but I got a card that gives me 50% off any other night’s stay, two free baked goods and a free soup at any hut, so it’s a pretty decent deal. 
After Zealand Falls Hut, the trail got MUCH easier to Ethan Pond Campsite. I flew through it, and just in time as some heavy rain moved in. I’m staying at Ethan Pond tonight and tomorrow will try to push close to Mt. Washington. My guess is that weather will push summiting it until Monday, but I will see.
 I was grateful for a shorter, easier day today (even though I hiked two extra non AT miles!!) and for the shelter to get out of the rain. It was good to see Apollo and Skutch again! I’m hoping for the weather to clear up tomorrow!","Garfield Ridge Shelter
",Ethan Pond Shelter,"Jun 23, Sat",14.50
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595253,"Today was pretty awesome! I found out that Choo Choo was ok today, hence my back editing of posts I hadn’t posted yet. I was quite relieved and felt much better after this news.
It was cloudy and misty in the morning. The weather was supposed to be ugly all day, so my plan was to hike to Lake of the Clouds just before Mt. Washington and try to get a work for stay there. The huts in the Whites allow a few thru hikers to do work for stay. Huts are pricey - usually $120 or so per night - but for an hour or so of work the huts will allow thru hikers to sleep on the common room floor and also feed us dinner. I wanted to try it!
The climb up Mt Webster in the morning was rough! It was a lot of hand-over-hand bouldering and very slow going. My first stop today was at Mizpah Hut. Apollo and Skutch were already there. They fed us leftover eggs, oatmeal and coffee. It was delicious! Zoom zoom showed up and we all chatted for a while.
I hiked on towards Lake of the Clouds, but again the hiking got quite difficult and slow. It was foggy and misty all day, so no views really. I was pretty wet by the time I got to Lake Hut. The head person there, Lindy, was really cool and took me in on work for stay! I washed dishes for a little over and hour and that was it! She gave me a bowl of soup while I hung out. Me, Apollo, Skutch, Fat Tony, and Snuggs all ended up doing work for stay. We hung out and waited while the guests ate. When they were done, we got the leftovers! It was incredible - stuffed shells, chicken parmigiana, bread, salad, brownies, turkey soup. I thought I had died and gone to heaven!
The huts are really quite big and much nicer than I’d imagined. They are like lodges really. Today I was grateful for the WFS experience and that I got up the crazy tough ascents and descents safely. Tomorrow I will summit Mt Washington! I’m hoping for clear skies....","Ethan Pond Shelter
",Lake of the Clouds Hut,"Jun 24, Sun",13.90
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596090,"I slept well on the hut floor. I woke up early, at about a quarter to five, as the crew got into the kitchen and started to work. We all started getting up and ready, slowly but surely. As an aside, I forgot to mention in my last post that Zoom Zoom also did work for stay. The weather outside looked pretty ugly. The wind was blowing foggy mist all over and visibility was quite poor. We hung out at a side table while the hut guests ate breakfast. At around five past eight, we decided to make our move. Apollo, Skutch and I went out first. There was a large group of people heading up the mountain in single file from the hut. They were moving pretty slowly, and we were pretty cold, so we went back in the hut to give them some time to get up the mountain, rather than try and blow past them. I also changed into my long sleeve smart wool and put my rain pants on over my shorts. After a bit we headed back out and started up the mountain. Apollo and Skutch went first and I hung back to go up with Zoom Zoom and Fat Tony. Snuggs was doing some work to get breakfast.
Visibility on the way up was basically cairn  to cairn. It was a short mile and change up and not a difficult climb. It was very windy and pretty cold, but we have been in much colder and worse conditions before, so it was fine. It was a bummer not to have any views, but we took a summit photo and went inside the visitor center. In the visitor center they had a snack bar, bathrooms, trash cans and A few stealthy outlets. I focused first on the latter two, plugging my phone and battery pack to charge in an outlet right below the registration log book, and dumping my accumulated trash in the trash can. It felt good to ditch that weight, and my phone was almost dead so the outlet was a timely find. There was a sign in the lobby that said “ Mt. Washington: Worst Weather in the World.” Apparently it really does have some of the highest winds and most volatile weather. There was also a plaque that listed the names of all the people who had died on Mt. Washington. It was not a short list. It included how they died, and I saw one that said “drowning.” Wow, that sucks! You climb to the second highest peak on the AT, prep for the weather so as not to die at the summit, and then fall into the Lake of the Clouds and drown! I ate a freshly baked cookie and had a cup of coffee, chatting with the others. 
After a while we decided to go down. I changed back to short sleeves and rain jacket and took my rain pants off to hike in shorts. We carefully made our way down, visibility still being a problem. We hiked down around the side of Mt. Clay and Mt. Jefferson, and I think it was around the time we went around Mt. Adams that it started to clear up. At first there were still clouds shrouding Washington’s peak, but eventually they moved away and left us with spectacular views of Washington and the other Presidentials, or The Dead Presidents, as I like to call them. We stopped at Madison Spring Hut before climbing Mt. Madison. I ate a ton of breakfast leftovers there and poured maple syrup all over my pancakes and oatmeal. I felt like Elf. After a break there, we set off to climb Madison and then descend into Pinkham Notch. We had absolutely gorgeous views of the Presidentials from Madison. It was pretty darn epic! I loved watching hownthe light would change as clouds passed over the mountains, briefly casting their shadows on the mountain sides and valleys.
The descent down into Pinkham Notch was brutal. It was knee-jarring, rock-hopping, slow-going, find-your-footing-or-break-an-ankle brutal. Zoom Zoom and I held up the rear, and by the time we rolled into the Pinkham Notch visitor center, we had Bambi legs and were hallucinating about food. Sadly, while they served food there, it was seemingly just for lodge guests, or we got there too late. Snuggs was there and also said no dice on the food. We got snacks inside from the shop instead. I was pretty tired and just ate a bunch of garbage. My dinner consisted of Reese’s cups, a Twix bar, a turtle ice cream bar and a huge brownie. That brownie was soooooo delicious! Pretty sure I was borderline getting diabetes eating that “meal” though. Oh well.... the trail will provide?
After the visitors center we walked like tired zombies to find a stealth campsite. Me, Fat Tony, and Zoom Zoom ended up camping just north of Apollo, Skutch and Snuggs. We camped right beside a beautiful river. In warmer weather I would probably have gone for a dip in the nice swimming hole that was just in front of our campsite. Today, while I didn’t have visibility on the Washington summit, I did have incredible views traversing the other Dead Presidents. I was grateful for this, to have hikers to team up with for safety, and  to be able to make it to a nice spot to camp for the evening (rainfly free!). Tomorrow I will work my way up Wildcat mountain and a handful of other mountains. If all works out I will go to the next notch and stay at Rattle Rattle River Hostel. We’ll see!","Lake of the Clouds Hut
",Stealth Campsite at Mile 1871.9,"Jun 25, Mon",15.40
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596091,"Playing a little catch up here so I’ll keep this brief. I got up early and made it over Wildcat Mountain and to the last Hut at Carters Notch in 3hrs and 40 minutes. Wildcat had some awesome views and a lot of bouldering to get up its peaks. There was a ski gondola along the trail as well, which reminded me of Vermont. I somehow managed to kill an hour and a half at the hut, eating breakfast leftovers and chatting with the staff. Zoom Zoom rolled in and I rolled out, keen to get going after I realized how long I’d been dawdling there. 
I climbed up Carter Dome. At the top there was a cairn, and as I walked towards it, a grouse flew at me from behind it. It startled me, and then she flew at me again! I then saw her little chick toddling around on the ground nearby. I took a picture of the grouse, but didn’t get the chick as I needed to get out of their space. I climbed Mt. Hight after this, which had awesome 360 degree views of the surrounding mountains, including Mt Washington and the Presidentials. Next were South, Middle and North Carter Mountains, and then Mt Moriah. It was a long day of ups and downs and steep ridge line scrambles! I had amazing weather and views and just kept on trucking, all the way down to Rattle River Hostel. I saw a lot of SOBO hikers, which was cool. There were also a ton of SOBO hikers at the hostel.
I was excited to get to the hostel so I could do laundry. I scrubbed myself and scrubbed, doing my best to remove the layers of filth. The water that flowed off of my body looked like water from the Ganges in India. Well, if at least looked like what I picture water from the Ganges to be. By the time I got washed and handed off my laundry to the hostel, it was just about 8pm. I ordered pizza from A place in nearby Gorham. They took forever to deliver it, but it was delicious when they did! It was a taco pizza, so it had all of the typical taco fixings but on a pizza pie. It was awesome! I feel like that’s a real Hungry Cat pizza. I ate an entire large pizza and a side salad with blue cheese dressing. By the time I was done with that, it was time for bed. I finally met Mumbles, a British NOBO I had been hearing about, and I saw Speedy again. I hadn’t seen him since Delaware Water Gap, although I actually bumped into him earlier in the day at the hut. Last, bit definitely not least, I met section hiker Diesel from NC. He approached me as he has been reading my journal, so it was cool to meet him as well, and flattering that he would read my daily digest. We talked about the Whites, of course, and their difficulty. Good luck on the rest of your hike Diesel!! 
I was grateful for the hospitality at the hut today, the great weather and views, having a hostel to rest at, and many other things. Tomorrow I will sleep in (a little) and then resupply and hike out. After a giant waffle breakfast, of course.... :-)","Stealth Campsite at Mile 1871.9

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596093,"I woke up at about 6:30, which is later than usual for me. It felt good to rest and the bunk at the hostel was really comfortable. I went down for breakfast, which was DIY waffles. Their waffle machine made four at a time, which was perfect. I sat and drank some coffee as I finished my waffles. I talked with a few southbounders about their hikes and then Zoom Zoom showed up and I talked with her for a bit about resupply plans. I enjoyed sitting at the hostel drinking coffee! The luxury of it was nice. I gathered my things together and then asked about my options for getting to Walmart to resupply. They had a shuttle that left at noon, but I wanted to get going earlier. I thought I would have to hitch into town, but then as luck would have it, the guy running the hostel came inside and said he’d found me a ride.
My ride was one of the hostel owner’s friends. He was younger than me and had previously hiked the AT. In Walmart he found this giant Chewbacca mask and decided he needed to have it. He then proceeded to wear it around Walmart and “impress” the older folks who were shopping there. Most found it funny. One lady didn’t react at all, which I found pretty funny. On the way in to Walmart I mentioned to him that I was getting food to carry me to Andover. He told me it was hard to get a hitch to Andover and recommended I suck it up, resupply with enough food to get to Rangeley, and carry the weight. In my experience, recommendations from past thru hikers are usually worth listening to, so I adapted my plan and got food to get me to Rangeley. 
My fortunate ride returned me to the hostel and entered himself, as Chewbacca. I wish I had thought to ask his trail name. Maybe now it should be Chewy! I got my food broken down and organized into my food bag, and it was time to go. As I laced up my shoes outside I talked with a southbounder about the upcoming challenges of the Mahoosic Notch and Mahoosic Arm. I started to get nervous about this, but then I remembered  what I went through with Moosilauke and how silly it was to worry. Maybe one of the final lessons of the trail after all this time - practice faith. Trust that I will get through, not by my own will and volition, but on the wings of something bigger than me. It isn’t a free ride. I have put in the time and practice hiking, day after day. I’ve done my best to listen to the trail, imperfectly of course. I have leaned on the kindness of strangers, and I have been tested mentally and physically throughout it all. Have I really had faith though? Or has it been the convenient faith, the faith that comes from wanting to get out of a tough bind. I’ve had faith in myself for sure. But that, and being able to accept that something bigger than me is part of this journey, are two very different things. I am not a religious person, but I have tried to embrace and engage a spiritual aspect in this journey. In the larger scheme of things, I am insignificant; this journey is too. Yet, somehow, through nature I have connected with this kind of all-encompassing higher power, and I can feel it in my journey. Now is the time for me to really take a leap of faith, relax, and let go. Whatever this force is, “Nature,” it will do the rest. I have done my part. And so I let all of the warnings about Mahoosic this and that pass by, and made a conscious effort not to worry. Instead, I started my climb away from the hostel, the Androscoggin River, and my last slice of New Hampshire. Indiana Jones teaches me this lesson in The Last Crusade. It takes a true leap of faith, a true belief, to cross the abyss that can keep us from truly living. And honestly, that’s what this journey has been about from the beginning. I guess I just forgot for a little while. It was a leap of faith to leave a fifteen year career to do this, to “walk in the woods.” It’s clear now why I had to.
I hiked up the hill planning on going to Gentian Pond Shelter. I knew I wouldn’t make it to the Carlo Col Shelter just before the Maine border. Who did I bump into but the two Canadians I met in Duncannon at The Doyle, Snickerdoodle and Chattacoochee! It took me a second to recognize them. They said they had skipped a few states as they were running out of money for the trip. Somehow I had caught up with them. Sometimes cats are speedy, but sometimes we take long naps....
I got to Gentian and Snuggs was there. It was good to see a Nobo face. The shelter had a great view! The weather forecast for tomorrow is not great - it’s supposed to rain all day, potentially heavy at times. That concerns me a little as some of the SOBOs said they wouldn’t dare do the Notch in the rain. But...as George Michael once said, you gotta have faith. Snuggs and I discussed it and we both agreed that we should be able to handle it in the rain as long as we went slowly. I guess we’ll see how it goes tomorrow! And tomorrow I will be in Maine. That seems surreal! I don’t really know exactly how I feel, but I guess excited and a little relieved! The journey has been great, but I’m getting tired. I think Maine will be a great way to wrap it all up!
I was grateful for the hostel stay and getting a ride to resupply today, as well as enjoying time talking with SOBOs, ZoomZoom, and having coffee. I am grateful for this shelter tonight, and for the strength to hike another day. I’m also grateful for the bug net I’m about to wear to sleep!!

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596094,"Today was the hardest day of hiking I have ever had. In some ways, it was also the most rewarding, not because of views or serenity, but because I survived. As the day ended, I sat soaking wet with my Knorr rice side leaking all over me, my food bag, and cook pouch as I poured boiling water into it, not realizing there was a hole in the bag. But I didn’t care. That’s small potatoes out here. I was too tired to care and too full of the thrill of survival. Here’s how today went down.
I got on the trail pretty early, around 6 I think. I was expecting a long a tough day. I also kind of wanted to get ahead of Snuggs so that maybe, just maybe, we would end up in the notch at the same time :-). He is much younger and hikes faster than me, but I thought it might be nice to have someone nearby to hear any potential screams of anguish that might come from my mouth, or to notify others where to find my broken carcass, etc etc. Either way, I started to hike.
The first challenge of the morning was climbing Mt. Success. The name seemed wildly premature to me! I climbed it nonetheless, and it was definitely a workout. The weather was alternating between misty, light rain, and just foggy. The top of Mt. Success was shrouded in an eery blanket of Santa’s beard. It felt like some kind of movie scene, and it was quiet except for the sound of the birds that remind my wife of The Hunger Games call. The feeling I got from it all was that I did not belong here. I was in a strange land full of things that existed in a world that I am not a part of, a wrinkle in time that exists only in some kind of parallel universe. It was like somehow, in passing through that fog, I was briefly entering another world. I thought of The Upside Down from Stranger Things - man I hope it’s not that! It was more like I was observing some strangely private universe, a place that carried the taste of isolation, sadness, longing, but was incapable of actually harboring those feelings. It felt like a world trapped from itself, no longer able to connect with the rest of the mountains and valleys below. I had to move on, lest I linger for a lifetime.
After Mt. Success I knew I was getting close to the Maine border. The rain picked up and I heard footsteps behind me. It was Snuggs, similarly looking for the border sign. Shortly, we found it. We took pictures there and took a few moments to absorb that we had made it to Maine. I honestly didn’t think too much about it, simply because I knew how much we had left to do today, and how tough the hiking had already been. Next we took a brief snack stop at the Carlo Col Shelter. There were 4 hikers there zeroing because they didn’t want to do the Notch in the rain. I couldn’t blame them, but I had to push on. We climbed Mt. Carlo and then Goose Eye Mountain, and finally Fulling Mill Mountain. The weather continued to be rainy and misty. 
As we descended down getting closer to the Mahoosic Notch, my right foot slipped and I started sliding. Some of these downhills were legitimately steep! Unfortunately, this time when I slipped, something extra special happened. Now, I am going to warn you that I am about to talk about the male anatomy. You know - the hoo ra and watchama doozits. But, not because I feel like talking about body parts is or should be taboo, perhaps for the sake of my own amusement, I’m going to attempt to do this using Dr. Seuss. Ok, so there’s Thing One, Thing Two, and The Lorax. As I slid forward my left trekking pole caught a solid hold into the ground. This caused me to pivot slightly to the left, but still with forward momentum. Somehow, the handle of my left trekking pole planted firmly into my crotchal region. That’s the medical term for it. As that happened I reached a tipping point where all my weight was on the trekking pole. To provide a visual, I looked like a human popsicle. Thing One and the Lorax escaped. Thing Two did not. My eyes bulged from their sockets like Roger Rabbit and I emitted some kind of noise - I don’t remember what. I was suspended like a shish-kabobbed popsicle man, and Snuggs, hearing my noises, turned around. As he did, my weight and the weight of my pack overcame the tension of my pole and the forces of gravity and sprung me forward. I literally pole vaulted forward via the frontal crotchal zone. Now, I know I’m getting medically technical here, but bear with me. My feet left the ground and I rode the pole forward until I fell forward onto the trail in a heap of exploding eyeballs and dismay at what had just happened. Obviously this hurt. A LOT. At some point Thing Two was released and the trekking pole handled had jabbed into my groin muscle for the final vault. I lay there grabbing at “things” (I wasn’t sure what) and gasping for air. Snuggs spoke: “that looked like one of those things where you might just need to lay there and breathe for a while.” Yep. It was. I lay there waiting for the adrenaline to subside, fearing what might have happened. After a few minutes, I was able to get up. I was covered in dirt and had bloodied my leg and elbow. I hadn’t broken anything, other than maybe Thing Two. I already had a weird and painful knot forming in my groin. But, I could walk. With every step, it hurt less. While it hurt like crazy, in hindsight, I think I got lucky. It could have been worse. I think I got lucky, I think I did that, I think I got lucky, said this Hungry Cat....
I hadn’t even made it to the Notch yet and had already hurt myself. Not good!  About 10 minutes after the popsicle pole vault incident, we came upon a group of Outward Bound kids heading southbound. The first kid in the group looked at me and said “did you just fall? Sure looks like it!” Thanks kid. 
Finally we got to the Mahoosic Notch. We knew we were there when all of a sudden we were climbing through a large boulder field and the temperature dropped about ten degrees. Think of the Notch as that gap between your kitchen range and your kitchen counter. Over time, lots of stuff just falls in it, and it all collects in the crack that time forgot. Where you might pull out your range and find pieces of pasta, grandma’s cigarette butts (she swore she quit!), and dead roach carcasses, in the Notch there are boulders  upon boulders with wood and fallen trees mixed in. For the next mile, Snuggs and I would boulder hop, climb, squeeze, and crawl our way through. Every few steps lead to a new bouldering problem to be solved. Some of the moves were harrowing. It would be easy to lose footing and slip into a crevasse, buckling a knee or cracking a femur. But we didn’t. The rain picked up force while we were in the Notch. We kept moving as best we could. It was cold enough to put my rain jacket on. There were pockets of snow and ice in the crevices below. They are probably there year round. We tried to take some pictures in the Notch to give it scale, but it was to no avail really. It’s one of those things you have to see in person to truly appreciate. 
When we finally got through the Notch we were exhausted and elated. We still had to get back up though. This portion of the trail is called the Mahoosic Arm. It is a very steep climb up multiple long sections of rock slab. It is very steep and slick, with no great footing in many places. There are lots of false summits along the way. Again we pushed on slowly but deliberately, and finally made it to the top. When we got to the Speck Pond Shelter, we were destroyed, but we had done it! I believe it took us about 12 hours to get through the 14.7 miles. The caretaker at the shelter could see we had been through a lot and was really nice. This was the Appalachian Mountain Club’s last tended shelter, which meant we had to pay a small fee to stay. He gave us some carrots and kale that he had and I put the kale in my rice side. We were soaking wet, bloody, bruised, but in good spirits because we knew we had basically done the hardest hiking we would have to do. I don’t recommend doing the Mahoosic Notch in the rain, but it’s obviously doable! Maybe a little piece of me just selfishly wants the story for myself ;-). 
I was grateful to have Snuggs as my battle buddy today in the Notch, grateful that Thing Two lived to tell the tale, and grateful that neither of us sustained a serious injury today. It was a day I will celebrate with sleep.","Gentian Pond Shelter

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596097,"I call this the first real Maine day because yesterday was too hard to be a normal day! I got up a little late today because I was so tired. Snuggs was gone early, headed into Andover. The weather was still ugly in the morning with mist, fog and light rain. It cleared up later on and got quite warm out, with a few sun showers on the peaks. Everything was muggy and wet!
The morning started with a tough climb up Old Speck Mountain. I didn’t get any views at the top because of the weather. As I got closer to Grafton Notch I saw a sign warning me of a dead moose up ahead. That’s so Maine! I started to climb up to see the moose body, but she. I saw some grey flesh I decided against it. The bugs were so bad already - who knew how many flies and whatnot would be on that thing! It smelled pretty bad.... Anyway, I climbed down into Grafton Notch and was pretty shell shocked. The climbing was tough and slow going, and I was very tired from the day before. Actually, I was very tired in general. The Whites and Maine were wiping me out! It was time to switch to my last set of Guthook maps and I was excited about that. I plopped down in the Grafton Botch parking lot and just took a moment to collect myself in a parking spot. A young guy shouted over asking if I was a thru hiker. I wearily shook my head in affirmation. He then asked if I wanted food. I shot up to attention! It’s not hard to get my attention with food, and I was quite hungry. He gave me a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and an apple. He was from Pennsylvania visiting Maine to do some hiking and had some extra food. Lucky for me he was kind enough to share it! I hiked out of Grafton Notch feeling better. The AT signage at the road there was cool, so I took a picture. Here we go - the last leg of the Guthook maps!
It didn’t take me long to feel beaten down again as I started to climb Baldpate Mountain. The bugs, specifically, were driving me insane. The mosquitos and black flies were incessant. I was wearing big spray, but it is quick to sweat off and even with it on they still hovered around me in a cloud. I tried to move faster but the terrain was tough. I kept going. 
I climbed up West Baldpate and stopped with three older ladies to take a break, enjoy the view, and have a snack. They were locals, very nice, and gave me two apple slices. My feet were so wet and pruney that I had to take my shoes and socks off for a while. Maine mountains feel like boggy rainforests. There is so much water on them, and the summits frequently have log bridges over bogs. Many of these are broken, and so you never known when it will be time to play Indiana Jones and run up a bridge as the side you’re on is sinking. Some of the bigs are frighteningly deep. Some will suck your shoes off. To sum it up, my feet are always wet in Maine, rain or shine. It is not ideal. That wetness though does bring a particular beauty to the mountains though, even as it wears me down. 
I climbed up east Baldpate and got some great views and a small rain shower. Getting down was tiring. I was going to hike to Hall Mountain Shelter but just couldn’t make it. I stealth camped by a nice stream and was happy to be done. Cooking dinner I used the rest of my fuel, so I guess I will be cold soaking my Knorr rice side tomorrow. I got frustrated today by the weather, how tired I was, how wet and uncomfortable my feet were, and how I haven’t had a cell signal in days. I finally got a text to my wife somewhere crossing Baldpate, and I felt bad because I vented a little. I’m just feeling beaten down, and I think the bugs are making it that much harder. But I’m sooooooo close!! The finish is indeed finally truly in sight. By evening I felt better because I had come up with a plan for getting to Katahdin, a true day-by-day plan. I also decided that I would zero in Rangeley. It would be my first zero since Damascus. I knew I needed it. The Maine ladies on Baldpate said Rangeley was a cute town. They have an ice cream shop.... This plan gave me something to look forward to. I would be dry soon!
I was grateful for my patient and understanding wife today, for the kindness of others, and for the great views today. Hopefully the terrain tomorrow will be less wet!
Postscript:
I’m working on catching up! Thanks for bearing with me. I may have to do these in batches as I get to towns to resupply. I will post as I get caught up and have signal!","Speck Pond Shelter

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596098,"Today was tough. I walked over Wyman, Old Blue, and Bemis Mountains. I got eaten by mosquitos despite efforts to repel them. They smacked on me like I snack on snacks! The eat like I eat! 
I passed Surplus Pond in the morning and realized that one of my favorite things about the ponds and bogs is the presence of bull frogs. They make a distinctive sound. I saw a few at this pond and took some video here (also uploaded to my videos) if you want to hear this and see a few of them: https://youtu.be/QBhDHB7v9QE. 
I got some great views today. The weather was hot and muggy. My feet stayed wet thanks to the wet trail and bogs. The forest was green and lush though. 
I met Ultra Runner at the Bemis Mountain Lean To (what they call shelters in Maine). I have been hearing about this NOBO from others. She is using the AT hike also as training for races. She gets off the trail sometimes to go run ultra marathons (think 100 mile races) and the. Comes back and keeps hiking. Just amazing!
I pushed on down the mountain to the first stream fording in Maine, Bemis stream. Right before the road crossing prior to the stream, I came upon a trail magic cooker! It was just what I needed to brighten a tough day of rugged hiking. There were waters and candy bars. It was lovely! As for the stream, Maine has a lot of streams you have to Ford and cannot rock hop across. Brilliant Hungry Cat mailed home his crocs, so I just had to walk through it in my shoes. I was able to partially rock hop it. My feet were both pretty wet anyway. I stealth camped north of the stream. I was grateful to have made my mileage today and gotten some nice views. I saw another grouse with chicks today and was grateful for that. I was grateful that cold soaking my rice side worked. I got eaten alive by mosquitos today, so I’m grateful my tent does not have holes in it! Tomorrow I hike into Rangeley! Maine’s ruggedness is really shaking me down and making me prove I am worthy of the thru hiker label. Go easy Maine, go a little easy....","Stealth Campsite at Mile 1934

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597095,"Last night I woke to bright flashing lights. It looked like a strobe light was going off in my tent. We had a big thunderstorm and the lightening was almost constant. It poured down rain and the inside of my tent got wet just from the splatter of the rain in the dirt. I decided to put my one pair of dry socks on to hike into Rangeley. I was on the trail by 6:30 and I am pretty sure my feet were soaked through by 6:45, just from hiking through puddles, mud and bogs. Maine is a very moist state!
I passed some beautiful ponds today. I love how I can be hiking and all of a sudden I’ll see one through the trees. One had a sandy beach, and another had an official campsite on its shores and had several canoes to take out on the pond.
I was anxious to get to Rangeley. I was hiking pretty hard when all of a sudden I heard the sound of something crushing underbrush, the kind of sound that instantly lets me know that a large animal is nearby. I looked up and there in front of me, about 15 feet away and 10 feet off the trail, was a moose! It caught me by surprise, and I it. I was excited as it stared back at me, but also nervous. It looked at me and then bounded away a little, and then stopped again and Looked at me. “Hey Moose!” I said repeatedly as I slowly skated on by along the trail. I wish I could have gotten a picture of it, but I just wanted to pass safely. Finally, it ran off away into the forest, leaving me both ecstatic and relieved. I honestly was beginning to think I wouldn’t see a moose. I couldn’t believe I’d just seen one! I had kind of pictured it being a more chocolate brown, but it was a greyish brown. It looked a little sad, honestly. It probably couldn’t get away from the mosquitos and flies either! I had some pep in my step after that. Seeing both bear and moose basically checked off the two animals I wanted to see most on the trip. The irony though is that the animals that have brought me the most joy on the trip are the ones I see every day - the chipmunks, the little birds that sound like they are whistling the Hunger Games call, etc. They have come to be an integral part of my AT experience, whereas the moose and bears feel more like “one offs.” Moose poop, however, has definitely not been a one off. They poop all over the trail. It’s like the moose latrine!
When I got to the road crossing for Rangeley I walked down to Hiker Hut, an off-the-grid hostel just near the trail. There was a sign that said this was the safest place to flag down a ride. I set about putting on my “I’m a safe and kind man who is hiking and not a murderous hobo and you will get jewels in your crown in heaven if you pick me up” face, and stuck out my thumb. It took a little bit, and then I saw a car pass me and slow down up ahead before it disappeared around a curve. Then the car looped back heading away from Rangeley and passed me again, pulling into this gravel drive across the street that seemed to be an abandoned camper in the woods. It had weeds growing all over it and holes in it. I couldn’t believe someone lived there! However, then they pulled back around towards me. They were coming for me.... Now, I don’t really have experience hitch hiking outside of the trail, but I feel like if someone passes you by and then comes back, it isn’t a great sign. It’s probably my paranoia, but I envisioned some kind of madman serial killer window shopping for a new cellar muse. Again, this is just my crazy mind at work. The car pulled up and two guys were in the front. They looked a bit rough and I could see they were drinking beers. Hmmmm.... I said “I’m trying to get to Rangeley.” “Get in” the driver said. Hmmmm.... He hadn’t actually said he was going to Rangeley. “You’re going to Rangeley?” I asked. “Get in I’ll get you where you need to go. Hmmmm.... It was still kind of vague answer. Anyway, beggars can’t be choosers so I threw my pack and poles in their trunk and hopped in. The first thing the driver said was “ just don’t call the cops on us.” What?? Why would I need to do that?!?!  “Of course I won’t” I said, trying to sound like a hardened criminal with street cred. In the end, they got me to town and were quite nice, just a little rough around the edges. I very much appreciated the ride and I thanked them.
I walked up to the hostel, Fieldstone, and it looked like it was under construction. I called the number in Guthook and the owner picked up. I was in luck because she had one last bunk available for today and tomorrow. I had forgotten it was Fourth of July weekend, and so pretty much everything else was booked. The trail provides! I threw my pack down by my bunk and the cleaning lady offered me a ride to the grocery store. I wasn’t organized enough yet to do a full resupply, but I did want to try and find a pair of cheap flip flops. I was regretting sending my crocs home. It was largely fine at camp, but I didn’t like wet shoes in town with no alternative, or the idea of not having something for fording stream  crossings that were coming up. The grocery store didn’t have any flip flops, but she dropped me off in town and I found some at an outfitter store there for $1.95 - sweet! I had a lot of stuff to do in Rangeley, but with my zero tomorrow I could do the bulk of it. I needed to make a schedule to get to Katahdin so that I could book a flight home before they were either all booked up or crazy expensive. And, of course I needed to do the usual resupply and laundry.
I walked over to the ice cream place, naturally first, and got a double scoop cone. I sat there at a bench looking out at a pond in town, enjoying the amazing treat. It was so good that I immediately ordered a milkshake afterwards. Yum! I went up to the laundry on my way back and stopped in. The guy on staff told me that the laundromat was closing, but offered to take my clothes and clean them for the morning at no extra charge! He was a super nice guy and talked with me for a bit about the trail. He was definitely used to hikers!
I called my wife on the way back to the hostel. It was great to talk with her finally and I wanted to run my plan to get to Katahdin by her, confirm a few things, etc. before I booked a plane ticket. Later I walked down to Lakeside Park in town, which is the boat launch point for Rangeley Lake. The park and lake were gorgeous! This town just seemed like quintessential central Maine to me, and I loved it. I grabbed some food at the nearby Red Onion and called it a day.
When I got back to the hostel, three kids that worked for the ATC were there. They were doing boundary line work and staying at the hostel another night until they were done. They were nice and looked like they had had a long day fighting the bugs in the woods. One of my projects tomorrow would be finding some new bug spray as I was all out! Ideally something strong, like Ben’s 100....
I was grateful for a lot today - for the ride into town, getting to be in town and get clean and eat real food, getting to talk with Gillian and to eat ice cream. Tomorrow will be hot, and a great day to rest!","Stealth Campsite at Mile 1956.6

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597097,"I slept in until almost 9 today! It felt incredible. Of course I was starving for breakfast, so I walked into town to Mooseley Bagels. I loved it immediately when I saw their painted Adirondack chair outside. It’s a diner-style cafe and had a counter, so I sat there. I had some coffee and a bagel sandwich, as well as a blueberry muffin. I stayed a while and worked on some trip logistics. 
By the time I left, I had a full belly, a plan to meet up with Apollo and Skutch, who I found out were stopping in briefly before hiking out, and a set plan to get to Katahdin, as well as a summit date and a reservation at the AT Lodge in Millinocket. It was a productive breakfast! I had to lock down the plane ticket because I was worried about flight availability, and they were already getting expensive. It felt weird to all of a sudden have to do responsible adult things, like plan and book tickets. It felt even weirder to be that close to the end! Before I really had a chance to think more on that, I met up with Apollo and Skutch for some more food. After that I had to search for bug spray, but I finally found some at a sport fishing store. They had Ben’s 100, so I decided I would try that. My picaridin-based spray worked, but it seemed to wear off so quickly. I went to a coffee shop to finish a few logistics and saw Snuggs. He had not zeroed in Andover after all and was looking for a place to stay in town, but everything was booked. I felt bad for him as it was quite hot outside, probably in the 90s, but it seemed he didn’t have much of a choice but to hike on. 
Back at the hostel I got set to walk to the grocery store to resupply. The ATC kids were headed that way so they gave me a lift, which was really nice. I bought the usual stuff to get me through to Caratunk. Some energetic southbounders showed up at the hostel and I spoke with them for a little while. One guy named Happy had started as a NOBO but hurt himself, so he was now trying as a SOBO. He asked me if I ever thought I could do it - make it all the way. I told him that I never thought I wouldn’t, and while that sounds cocky, it’s very true. I knew I would never quit the trail, no matter how hard it was. Quitting does not sit well with me. Quitting leaves a hungry heart that cannot be filled, and a lifetime of wondering “what if.” My only concern was around hurting myself to where I could not physically continue. Even in moments where I have wished I wasn’t in the woods, or walking in a storm, etc., I have never once entertained the idea of just going home and calling it quits. That’s just me though - I won’t pass judgment on people who do quit, or have wanted to. 
I walked down the street to get some food at a pub-like place. It was jam packed so I had to sit at the bar. It was loud and the Red Sox game was on. Just like that, I was out of the woods and staring at the boob tube! It frightened me how easy it was to revert to lethargy. I ate a hamburger alone and thought about my journey coming to an end. At one point I teared up a bit, but I’m not sure why. Then I ate the rest of my French fries, licked the grease off my fingers and left to go to sleep. Oh, wait. I ate ice cream one more time :-).
It was a lovely day in Rangeley and just what I needed. I was so grateful to rest and to see other hikers, as well as excited to have a plan in place to wrap things up. Now I didn’t have to worry about anything other than getting to the Big K.","ME Route 4 (Rangeley road crossing)

It was going to be another scorcher today too - 90s. It’s funny how the most extreme weather seems to be following us this year. I never thought I’d get to Maine and find a Georgia summer waiting! Fortunately for me, I’m used to the heat; others are not so lucky.
Today as I set out hiking it felt different. I finally had some kind of schedule to make, a plan to keep. In some ways, it gave me some purpose. Either way, I still had stretch of time to think about it all. The hiking today was challenging, but not ridiculously so. It was more classic southern Maine, with steep uphills straight up mountains, slippery steep downhills straight back down, and a little hand-over-hand action in both directions. Ok, it was strenuous hiking.... 
I climbed up Saddleback Mountain and the weather was looking iffy. Fog and/or clouds blew by and it was a bit windy. I always get a little nervous climbing balds where the area above treeline is extensive. I picture myself getting caught in a bad lightening storm, looking like human kindling for the whims of Thor. I pushed on, noting the beauty of the clouds as they alternately shrouded and revealed the stark fierceness of the mountain. Intermittent rays of sun highlighted the lush green of the fragile alpine flora. Pink and white alpine flowers were still in bloom. I climbed on over the Horn. Saddleback is exactly what it sounds like. Along with the Horn, it looks like a giant saddle. I had wonderful views from the Horn as the clouds became sparser and the wind blew them along. I felt small and insignificant up there, and rightfully so. I need these reminders lest I spend too much time in my head thinking about me, while the rest of the Earth simply revolves around the sun.
The descent down Saddleback was slow going, with one section having a bit of rope and rebar to hold onto. At the bottom was the Orbeton stream, which needed to be forded. I wouldn’t be able to rock hop this one. Fortunately I had just acquired some professional fording shoes (aka my $2 flip flops). I enjoyed fording the river; it felt good on my feet on such a hot day. 
When I got to the lean-to I felt like I had walked a longer day than I had. I set up my tent and chatted with a few SOBOs. It’s so interesting to see people just getting started with their thru hikes! I like talking with them and hearing about their experiences. I bite my tongue and don’t offer advice - if they want it they will ask. They don’t need to worry about Mahoosic or the Whites right now. One day at a time, one step at a time, and they will have their trail experiences and become stronger, smarter, more efficient. Right now they just need to keep having fun.
I was grateful for feeling well rested and that the weather held out today. I enjoyed the wonderful views on Saddleback and the challenge of the climbing. Tomorrow I will work my way closer to the Bigelow range.","ME Route 4 (Rangeley road crossing)

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597103,"Holidays on the trail feel different. The Fourth of July is typically filled with barbecues and fireworks. I was just hiking on a very hot fourth. I got up early as I normally do, and because I knew it would be hot. I climbed Spaulding Mountain and then Sugarloaf Mountain, which has a big ski resort on the other side. I saw someone taking down a tent and it was Snuggs! I figured he would have already been to Stratton. He said he was hiking there today and going to take a zero. I hope he manages to find a good place to stay. We hiked together for a bit, but he is a lot more nimble than I and soon disappeared down the mountain. The descent was steep and rocky with ample room to slip and fall, and so it took me a while to get down. At the bottom I crossed the Carrabassett River. It is listed as requiring fording, but it had a plank bridge across the middle gap and the rest was just rock hopping. When I got there, a southbounder and his partner were clearly bickering as she struggled to get across. She was nervous about balancing on the rocks and then the board. I totally understand that! I still get nervous on that stuff, even after plenty of practice. Her partner looked at me and said “she just has no balance.” Hmmmm.... I just kept my mouth shut and waited patiently for her to get across. I thought she did just fine. There are plenty of things I’ve crawled over just to make myself feel less like I might fall and break an ankle. Anyway, they were having a moment, so I let them have it and walked across to the other side. 
I climbed south and north Crocker mountains, both over 4000 feet, and descended to the road crossing for Stratton. It was on this stretch that I hit the two thousand mile mark!! It was hard to believe I had walked that far! That famous Confucius quote is so true: a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step. So does a journey of 2190.9! I was pumped and made a small rock monument in the dirt. 
I hiked on and came to the Stratton road crossing. Across the road was a bridge over Stratton Brook, and who was standing on that bridge but a Ridge Runner. It wasn’t just any Ridge Runner; it was the same guy who gave me my first trail magic at Amicalola State Park (the orange cord tie that holds my AT registration badge to my pack), told me about the “hiker handshake” (fist bump), and showed me the PCT method for hanging a bear bag: Nick, or “Master Splinter.” It was just like the trail to do something like this! Someone who played a small, but key, role on that first day was here towards the end. He said he was looking after the Bigelow stretch now and also the caretaker at Horns Pond Lean-to, which is where I would stay tonight. Too funny! I walked the rest of the way up to Horns Pond thinking about the weird coincidences of the trail. The hiking was strenuous and fun. There were some bouldering challenges, and then as I got towards the shelter there was a beautiful rock outcrop that provided a picturesque aerial view of Horns Pond. It was stunning.
I climbed the rest of the way down and went past the tenting area to the shelter, just to check it out. There were two shelters. Some weekend hikers were pitching their tent inside one. Hmmm.... I would let Master Splinter deal with that! I met a South African couple at the tentsite that was flip flopping. I selected my spot and set up my tent. As I did so, another section hiker came in. She was from Massachusetts and was quite kind and gave me a carrot and a nectarine. Nothing beats fresh fruits and veggies on the trail. There was a lookout just down a trail adjacent to my tent site and we both ended up eating our dinners there. She was good company and we talked about backpacking. She had thru hiked the Long Trail. Master Splinter showed up and gave us a rundown on mushroom foraging that was really interesting. He had a bunch of mushrooms he had collected that day. I wanted to check out the pond before it got too late, so I went down and sat by the shore for a while. I startled a beaver, and while I didn’t see it, I heard it smack the surface of the water with its tail before diving under.
Later as it was getting dark, I again saw the section hiker at the lookout point. We were both there to see if we could see fireworks. The ridge looked over the Sugarloaf ski resort, as well as several valley towns. Sure enough, we saw lots of fireworks! It was probably the coolest Fourth of July experience I have ever had. In the darkness, a bunny busied itself in front of us with bunny things. It was past hiker midnight though (it was about 9:30) and I needed to get to bed, so I excused myself and laid down for the night.
It was so awesome to see Master Splinter today and I was grateful for that, as well as for the company of a cool section hiker at camp, and the incredible campsite and fireworks display. What a great day!","Spaulding Mountain Lean-to

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597108,"I knew today was going to be a big day, so I got on the trail just before six. I normally wouldn’t plan on walking this many miles with a big mountain range in the plan, but my wife actually used a trail journal from a prior year we had both read to get some further input on the terrain. It seemed that the hiking would get much easier after Little Bigelow Lean-to and West Pond Carry Lean-to, and so I decided to go for it. 
The Bigelows and Avery Peak were amazing! I was up on top while the morning was still early. I stopped to chat with a few locals and learned that the large lake in the valley below was Flagstaff Lake. They told me it is the second largest man-made lake in Maine depending on the water level, and it has flooded housing foundations on its bottom from when the river was dammed to form the lake that exists today. The views from the Bigelows and nearby Avery Peak were just stunning! I loved it up there and spent a while just looking around. They say you can sometimes see a faint outline of Katahdin from Avery Peak, but I could not today.
Climbing down I startled another grouse, which in turn startled me! It flew out of the bushes and grazed my shoulders as it flew to the other side of the trail. I jumped and let out a weird yell! I could hear it’s chicks crying on my left, no doubt thinking that mom was back with food.
I took a quick break on Little Bigelow to eat a snack and have some water. I was standing there with my bug net on when another northbounder came up behind me. His name was Homebound, from New Hampshire, and he said that he had read my journal before he started his hike in mid March. How cool! He was super fast, so he quickly hiked off into the distance in front of me. I’m always surprised when I meet people who have read my journal. It’s a good feeling though! 
I kept plodding along, going slowly down the mountain. The terrain eventually evened out and I was able to walk at a good pace. I passed West Carry Pond and then East Carry Pond, where I saw Homebound again, camped near a nice sandy beach. I made it to the lean-to just as the sun was getting lower in the sky, around 7:30. I got an awesome tent site right below the lean-to on the banks of Pierce Pond and caught a beautiful sunset there while I cooked my dinner. It was breathtaking!
I was grateful for the wonderful views of the Bigelows today, the good terrain later in the day and the beautiful ponds I passed along the way. I was tired, but I felt good! It would be easy to fall asleep tonight!","Horns Pond Lean-to

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597117,"Yesterday Homebound had told me that it was supposed to rain around 5am and taper off around 11am. Sure enough, at a few minutes past 5, the rain came. By the time I got hiking it had lightened up. My first destination was the Kennebec ferry. The AT crosses the Kennebec River at a dangerous, wide spot in the river. Therefore, several groups sponsor a ferry service here to keep hikers from trying to ford the river and to ensure safe passage. The ferry is a canoe that can fit two hikers at a time. As I hiked down to the ferry stop and arrived at about 8:30am, it started to pour. The first ferry was at 9am, so I basically stood there in the rain until then. A section hiker from Kentucky showed up, and then Homebound arrived. We were all a big wet mess! Fortunately, the rain let up a bit once the ferry arrived and we had no issues getting across the river. Homebound was in the canoe with me and noticed a deer, upstream, fording the river in the opposite direction. I could almost hear the deer muttering “wussies!” 
On the north side of the Kennebec River is the sleepy little town of Caratunk. There are really only two places in Caratunk of interest to most hikers - the Caratunk House hostel/B&B, and the post office. I wanted to go to the Caratunk House to eat! They are known for their pulled pork sandwiches and their milkshakes. I needed to go to the Caratunk House to resupply and pick up my shoes that I had mailed there. After I bounced the pair from Hanover to Caratunk, I ordered a half size smaller just to make sure I had the right size. Therefore, I would also need To go to the post office to send back the pair that wasn’t the best fit. The post office didn’t open until 2, so I had a lot of time to kill....
It turns out it was not hard to kill that time! I ate.... The food was amazing, and over the course of the morning and afternoon I ate 3 pulled pork sandwiches and 2 milkshakes. Paul, the owner, was really great too. One of my pairs of shoes was a day or two late. I decided just to go with the size I had bounced from Hanover, and so he is helping me by getting my package tomorrow or next week and forwarding it to my home in Atlanta. He was just really cool about that and everything really. I can’t say enough good things about Paul and the Caratunk House. He gave me a lift home from the post office and we went for a little side trip to get the postal lady’s dog. It had gotten loose and was running around the local outfitter. It was a funny little side expedition. 
It was about 3:30 before I could leave Caratunk. I had to book it up Pond Mountain to make it to the lean-to. I got in kind of late and tented by the Brook there. I met a northbounder on the way in named Frank from the Netherlands. He was completing his triple crown with this hike. For those who don’t know, that means he has already thru hiked the Pacific Crest Trail and the Continental Divide Trail. As I set up camp, a strong, cool wind was blowing. This was not a stormy wind; this was a high pressure system wind. It was getting cooler!! Tonight I would sleep well. Tomorrow I would hike to Monson, my last resupply stop to get me through the Hundred Mile Wilderness. 
I was grateful today that the rain did stop, that the weather improved, and for all of Paul’s help and refuge at the Caratunk House. It was a great day! I wish I had another one of those milkshakes right now!","Pierce Pond Lean-to

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597120,"It was chilly when I woke up at first light. I loved it! It really felt like Maine should (in my opinion). I got on the trail a little before six. I wanted to get an early start so I could get into Monson in the afternoon and have some time to relax there as well as do my usual hiker errands. I started with a brisk pace to warm up a little. The climb of the morning was Moxie Bald, and I had beautiful views on top. I also had it all to myself, which was cool. At the summit, the breeze was chilly, but I was plenty warm from the hike up. I took a few photos and then started down the other side of the mountain, which was pretty boggy. 
After Moxie the hiking mellowed. There was a stretch that followed a river through  Horseshoe Canyon, which I really liked. The views and sounds of the river were beautiful while I walked. I kept on hiking and chatted with a few folks I passed on the trail, and before I knew it I was at the ME 15 road crossing. I got there just before 2:30pm, and somehow I had a tiny cell signal and was able to call Shaw’s hostel to come get me. I hadn’t originally planned to stay in Monson, but after hearing about Shaw’s it seemed like a nice place, and it was easiest if I stayed the night after resupplying. 
Hippy Chick and her husband Poet own and run Shaw’s. They thru-hiked in a past year and seemed very passionate about the trail and Maine. Hippy Chick picked me up at the trailhead and took me to Shaws. It was, indeed, a great place. It was full of SOBOs and a few section hikers. I also caught up with a few NOBOs: Apollo and Skutch, Homebound, and two people I hadn’t seen in a very long time - Redbird and Gumby. We all ended up having dinner together in town and recounting war stories, as well as learning a bit more about each other.
Resupply in town was a little rough in terms of selection. Shaw’s had most things, but only one rice side. I ended up piecing together my resupply between Shaw’s, the gas station, and the expensive general store. To be clear, I had plenty of food. I think since I knew it was my real last real resupply I was just hoping for a few things that I couldn’t get - you know, first world Hiker problems :-). I knew this was almost my last hurrah of eating garbage, which I will probably miss in some ways and not in others. I also stopped by the ATC office in town to get the lowdown on how it works with The Birches shelter at Baxter State Park, etc. I’m glad I did because I did not realize I needed $10 cash for the Birches (because I didn’t pay attention to my AWOL guide!).
I felt pretty sorted and ready to go after Shaw’s. It was interesting seeing all of the southbounders there! One lady was quitting after going through the hundred mile wilderness. Others were just starting to find their grooves. I was grateful to see my NOBO friends at the hostel, grateful for the fact that we’d all made it this far, and also that there was still more of the journey to come. Tomorrow I will enter The Wilderness. Ok, well, re-enter I guess :-).
Postscript:
Thanks for hanging with me as I haven’t posted for a while! If you have AT&T in Maine and don’t live in Portland or Bangor, just throw your phone away! It’s dead weight.... I also have been super tired lately and can’t seem to stay awake, so it has been a struggle to stay caught up. Nevertheless, please bear with me and I should be up to date soon. I will have an entry for every day, all the way to the end! I am uploading more photos as I go along as well.","Bald Mountain Brook Lean-to
",Monson (ME15 Road Crossing),"Jul 07, Sat",22
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597157,"Oh, breakfast...the best meal of the day. I woke up to lovely weather in my lovely bunk to the sound of my stomach growling. You know, the daily routine, though I didn’t wake up at 4:30 today. I slept until a respectable 5:30 or so. I went downstairs to join the rest of the crew for breakfast, which Shaw’s does for a fee (i.e. they don’t bundle it in with your bunk; you can choose if you want it). There were a lot of hikers at Shaw’s - section hikers, SOBOs, NOBOs. The NOBO table was full so I sat with Frank, the triple crowner from the Netherlands, and some SOBOs and section hikers. This also gave me a better chance at more food!! What I didn’t realize at the time was that Conan (the ultra marathon runner, Matthias, from Germany who I had met early on at Blue Mountain Shelter in Georgia) was sitting at the NOBO table. I wished I had recognized him, but we both looked so different now. He had already finished his hike and was back in Monson to do some trail magic with Poet from Shaw’s.
Breakfast was a grand affair. Poet made these potatoes in a cast iron skillet that were just incredible. We got eggs as well and blueberry pancakes. Frank and I were typical NOBO vultures. The pancakes came in one common plate on the table. We sat and stared and waited and no one was touching them! Frank said, “excuse me, is anyone going to eat the pancakes?” Everyone said “no, we are too full.” BINGO! Frank and I grabbed the plate and ate all of them. Then a second plate came and we ate most of those too. This was for a table of about ten people.... That’s what we do!
After breakfast I decided not to leave on the first shuttle out. I said goodbye to Apollo, Skutch, Gumby, and Redbird, then went upstairs to get organized. I didn’t have that much time, so I threw my stuff together, settled up with Poet, and got into the van. Homebound was on the shuttle as well. At the trailhead, Poet gave us all a brief little farewell monologue. He said he wrote a haiku back when he thru hiked and it was something to the effect of “drink deepest when your glass is almost empty because that is when the flavor is richest.” I am absolutely positive I’m butchering that because what he said was actually a haiku (I think) and actually sounded like it made sense. The message though was the same: the last drops of the experience can be the sweetest if you savor them. Wise words. He also said one or two things to the SOBOs about what they could expect, and one or two things to us NOBOs about what we could expect. It was all spot on in the end. I really liked Poet. He was sort of like some kind of Gateway man, helping hikers pass through the respective stage of their journeys. He reminded me a bit of The Dude from The Big Lebowski because he was so laid back and had a “relaxed sageliness” to him, but he wasn’t a fake or comical character at all. He’s basically the perfect dude to have at Shaw’s for that leg of the journey - it’s either your beginning or your end, and he’s a calm guy to make sure you’re set up for a good experience. 
Homebound headed out first, and then myself and a section hiker with her dog. I only planned to walk 15 miles, so I took it pretty slowly, more strolling than hiking. My food bag was really heavy with 5 days of food and ridiculous amounts of sugar in it. We all stopped and took pictures at the “border” sign leading into the Hundred Mile Wilderness. It seemed comically ominous, but only because I had been hiking for so long and was used to resupplying for such distances. Shortly after I began to run into SOBOs heading into Monson. They all said the same thing: “I’m so ready to be out of the woods!” They looked beaten down and seemed dejected. Hopefully they will continue on. It made me wonder if the bugs were going to be really bad. The terrain looked pretty tame on the map, but maps can be deceiving. Sometimes I think I’ll fly through an area, and then it turns out to be boggy and laden with roots and rocks that all slow me down. Nevertheless, the weather was beautiful today and the hiking was pretty easy.
The section hiker, Mary, and her dog Pepper caught up to me while I was chatting with some southbounders. We started talking and I hiked behind her for a while. She was an ENL teacher (English as a New Language) and this was her first solo backpacking trip. We got to the beautiful Little Wilson Falls and it was time to take some pictures and have a snack. There was a couple there and their little boy was just running around naked in a pool above the falls. Note to self: do not get water from said pool.... Mary took a picture for me at the falls, and I decided to hike on. I wanted some alone walking time, and thus far the famed wild and remote Wilderness was chock full of people!
I tried to reflect on the trip a little. Funny enough, at first I thought about how there wasn’t really much to think about. As a friend back home would sometimes say, “I did a thing.” I teared up a little thinking about it though, and I didn’t know why. It wasn’t because I wasn’t ready for it to end. Maybe it was because it just felt like i had “been through something,” or maybe I  was overcome by gratitude that I was actually able to do this and have these experiences. Not everyone gets to do this. Not everyone can, for many reasons, and the saddest reason being that not everyone will take the risk to live a dream, even if they have the means otherwise. I often find that songs get stuck in my head on the trail, and today was no different. Without even knowing why, I was singing “Say Hello 2 Heaven,” from an album called Temple of the Dog. This was a collaboration between Chris Cornell and some Pearl Jam band members back in the early 90s (I think circa ‘91). Cornell wrote the song, and the album was a kind of tribute to the vocalist of a band called Mother Love Bone, Andy Wood, who had died from a drug overdose. In the song Cornell sings: “I, I never wanted to write these words down for you, with the pages of phrases of things we’ll never do.” It’s the saddest line, and all I could think about was how nothing is guaranteed in life. I could get hit by a runaway bread truck tomorrow! My point is, when I set out in this journey I really had no expectations - it was just something I’d wanted to do for a long time. I decided I didn’t want to end up with a long list of things I wanted to do but never did. And whenever I die, I don’t want other people staring at a list of things that we never “got around to” either. Life is precious. The status quo in society isn’t necessarily feeding healthy messages to me about how I should spend my time, what I should do, or how I should prioritize things in life. In fact, I think the norm is wrong. I don’t want to make a long list, work my life away and then see what I’m still physically able to do or can get to before I’m dead. I want to hike, I want to live, I want to feel, I want to breathe, I want to experience. And I will. So I guess, if anything, maybe the AT was helping me to break free - to think more freely and to get “better” at really living my life. I thought about New Hampshire’s State motto: Live Free or Die. If I’m not living freely, am I not kind of dead anyway? I think only through this hike have I begun to further break down this idea, to really see the layers of applicability it has in my own life. If I let work control my life, am I free? Hiking the AT has really helped me start to free myself from the biggest slave creator I know - myself. I ultimately choose how I live my life, and I have let others, and the status quo or norm, influence me too much. The AT has allowed me to see that. I can see that now. So I guess I had some things to think about after all :-).
I walked on and came to a beautiful cascade and pool stream called Vaughn Stream. There was a nice swimming hole just below the upper cascade and a stealth campsite as well, so I was tempted to stop there. I was freshly clean though from Shaw’s, and there would be other opportunities in the Wilderness, so I admired the spot and kept going. Maybe Mary and her dog would want to stop there and enjoy it. 
I hiked past a group of Vets who were hiking the Hundred Mile Wilderness and summiting Katahdin. They were part of a big group organized by the Wounded Warrior Project. The rest of their group was camped up ahead at Long Pond Stream, about 1.5 miles south of the shelter. I pushed on to the lean-to and was the first person there. I set up my tent and, of course, started making my dinner. Why did Maine decide to call their shelters “lean-tos???” It’s the biggest misnomer. They are standalone structures and nothing about them is propped against a tree or rock or slope to provide the shelter. One would think we were hanging out under teepee-like structures. They are just shelters like the rest on the trail.
Later on Mary and Pepper showed up. I was impressed that they made it! There were some hills and climbs on that 15 mile stretch, so it would be a long way for someone without hardened trail legs. They both hiked it like champs! A southbounder named El Gringo Loco showed up shortly after that. He said he used to own four large restaurants, had a bunch of “stuff,” and still wasn’t happy. He sold it all and moved to Ecuador, where he lives cheaply and owns almost nothing. He rents a furnished apartment. He did, however, have a TON of stuff on the trail, LOL! He admitted as much to me and later asked for any advice. I offered two things: 1. Get comfortable being uncomfortable, and 2. drop whatever isn’t crucial for survival - the lighter the pack, the more fun the hiking, which is what we all do most of the time. When he came into camp, the battery for his steripen was dead so he couldn’t purify water. He could boil it, but I’m not sure he had thought of that. I filtered some water for him. I also filtered for Mary, who had brought a water filter pump her boyfriend had lent her. The water source was a mere trickle, so a pump that couldn’t be submerged was useless. I helped them have water for the evening and morning, and they both learned the lessons they needed to learn, just like we all do when we first start. 
The three of us talked until after dark, which was like talking until after hiker midnight! I went back to my tent to get ready for another day, and promptly fell asleep. I was grateful for such a nice, relaxing day today, and grateful to have the reflection time I needed as well as still have nice people to talk with at the end of the day. Tomorrow I will wake up early and do it all again.","Monson (ME15 Road Crossing)

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597181,"I woke up early, like most mornings. It is getting light at 4am because I am so far east, so I’ve been waking up around 4:30 when the birds are singing and the red squirrels begin to chirp angrily around me. This morning was no different - I got up early, ate my pop tart and honeybun breakfast, and hiked north. 
Today I climbed a few small mountains. Barren Mountain was the tallest at 2660 feet. I usually don’t start thinking about hills as mountains unless they are 3k feet at this point, but I got great views from the ledges at Barren. I went over a few other smaller mountains and then Chairback mountain, which had a little bit more technical hiking to it, but nothing too crazy. I took a side trail east to check out West Chairback Pond. It was a classic, beautiful Maine Pond, so I took a picture of it. 
After filtering water from a pretty little stream that crossed the trail, I hiked downhill across a gravel road to the West Branch of the Pleasant River. The river was somewhat wide and shallow; I would have to ford this one. A big group of girls was coming through the river southbound, and they stopped to talk with a ridge runner named Gin Gin who was standing there. A few flip floppers hiking south were there too, and then a couple with their two young children showed up - they had walked from a nearby parking lot to do s day hike to this area called Gulf Hagas. Hundred Mile Wilderness???? I had expected it to be wild, remote, rugged, and sparsely populated, mostly with thru hikers. Instead, it was more like the Hundred Miles of Summer Camp! I suppose the point is that there aren’t great road crossings to hitch into town to resupply, but I did cross so many roads and see so many people that it didn’t feel like I was that far away from civilization. 
I talked with Gin Gin briefly and then forded the stream in my $2 flip flops. I hiked on up the AT until I got to the Gulf Hagas trail and then walked a short distance on that trail to check out Screw Auger Falls. It was a gorgeous waterfall with a swimming hole below it. I thought about swimming, namely because I wanted to clean the salt out of my clothes, but there were some day hiker families already swimming there and I didn’t feel like making a crowd, so I turned back and headed north again following the white blazes.
I was the first to arrive at the lean-to even though it was about 5pm. I picked a tent spot, signed the log book, and cooked my dinner. As I was finishing eating, a female hiker came in. She was hiking southbound, a flip flopper who had hiked north to Marion, VA and was now headed south. Her trail name was Danish because she was from Denmark. She asked me about the Whites and mileage, the huts, etc. I retired to my tent to try and journal a little before falling asleep. I haven’t had a signal in a long time, and unsure of the weather, I put up my rain fly. I prefer to sleep without it, but it’s also not fun having to get up in a storm to try and throw it on! I was grateful for the views and hiking today, and for the continued kindness of the weather. I hope that holds!","Long Pond Stream Lean-to

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597191,"It didn’t rain overnight, which was nice. I executed my typical early morning exit and started the climb up Whitecap Mountain. This would be the last climb of any real mountain I would undertake (3650 feet) until Katahdin, and also the first time I would see Katahdin, of the weather permitted at the summit. I was excited about this. I also wondered if I would even know which mountain it was! Turns out it was easy - there is a white arrow and a letter “K” painted on a rock at the north summit viewpoint indicating where to look. Katahdin also stands alone, so it is not hard to pick out, versus other mountains that seem to be peaks connected to other peaks. I made good time up Whitecap. There were stone steps leading up the mountain, and down, in parts, once again illustrating that the Hundred Mile Wilderness is not really rugged at all. In southern Maine we would have had to climb up sheer rock and slip and slide our way down. It was really nice to get a break from that! 
When I saw Katahdin, things started to get real. I already had a plan to summit on the 14th, only 4 days away, but my routine was largely the same. I wake up, hike, see beautiful things, eat, sleep, and do it all again. I had not yet seen the end point. It was still a ways off, but it was very real. I was excited and wanted to text my wife a photo of it, but couldn’t. I later found a fleeting signal on the south side of the mountain and was able to get a few texts out to her, but then that mysteriously disappeared as well. I was lucky to have good weather and views on Whitecap as I had heard it might rain today. I left the summit with purpose in my legs - simply to walk north. I’d tell you how I felt seeing Katahdin for the first time, but the truth is, other than nervous excitement, I didn’t feel much yet. It was four days in the future and I was doing what I had set out to do - living in the moment.
I had some more ups and downs to navigate, but I got to the lean-to relatively early (2:30). I was really looking forward to an early day because I wanted to catch up on some journal writing as well as take a swim and clean my clothes. My AWOL guide said there was a good swimming hole right in front of the shelter, and boy was there! Cooper Brook cascaded down a series of drops into a deep pool directly in front of the shelter. It was gorgeous, and I regretfully forgot to photograph it. When I got to the shelter, I came around the corner and saw it was filled with about 12 girls who looked to be college aged. Of course...a camp.... I said hello and then read and signed the shelter log. The tent sites by the Brook looked full, but I had passed overflow tent space a few hundred yards south. Those spots had no view though, so I asked the girls if they knew of any spots just past their tents. Hey said there was one left! I was excited and ran to see, and sure enough there was plenty of space for my tent. I pitched camp and got settled, and then headed to the stream to rinse out my clothes and swim. On the way, the girls stopped me and asked if I was thru hiking, how long I had been on trail, and have me some twizzlers. Yum! I thanked them and set about getting in the water. I took off my shirt and tried to wring it out in the pool. It was pretty nasty and was starting to develop a large hole on the lower back from my pack rubbing it. The hole was about the size of a teacup saucer. I laid it out on a rock to dry, along with my buff that I would use as a towel, and went to the edge of the water to find a place to ease in. The first thing I saw on the edge of a rock was a leech. Great.... I wanted to wash badly enough though, so I went around to the deep end of the pool and jumped in. It was crisp, but not freezing. I could just barely touch the bottom with my toes. It was a nice, sandy, gravelly bottom - not gross and muddy. I saw that the girls were contemplating swimming st the shallow end, testing the water and talking about leeches. I had the pool all to myself! I swam around and enjoyed the beautiful cascade view. A southbounder came into camp earlier, and I saw her up on a rock working on cooking dinner. She will soon become a machine with that routine! 
After swimming for a bit, I decided to get out of the water and dry off. I still had to dry my clothes as best I could - I would be hiking in them tomorrow. I got out of the water and went to talk to the southbounder while I dripped dry. As I went over to the rock I was sitting on, about half of the camp girls started stripping off all of their clothes. They took off ALL of their clothes, right there! They weren’t trying to hide anything either! Honestly, it was pretty awkward. I had no idea how old they were, I was trying not to look (but I’m only human!!!!), their camp counselor, who looked to be about 26, was just standing there, and meanwhile this was all happening behind the southbounder who was talking to me. I tried to focus on her face.... At one point I was mid sentence talking with her and the girls in back started stretching in the water and I just said something like “I’m sorry, I’m sure you know there are a bunch of naked girls behind you. I think I should just go to my tent now.” She laughed and commented on the situation herself with her own facial expression. Now I had a challenge though - my shirt and buff and flip flops were over by the girls, fortunately by the half that were still clothed. One of them looked at me with something like embarrassment, and then pity in her eyes. I just grabbed my stuff and put my head down and went to my tent to change. Wowzers! Seems like the Hundred Mile Wilderness has a little bit of everything! I journaled in my tent and ate some snacks, and then hours later resurfaced for dinner. I took my food over to the shelter to eat. The girls had packed out the shelter. The counselor was sitting on a rock and I sat on another nearby. She asked me if I wanted shelter space, but I told her no, the rock would do. All of the girls were making some kind of bracelet and singing songs in unison in the shelter. Were those friendship bracelets?? Maybe I had misjudged something here. “Excuse me,” I said. “What age range is this group?” The counselor gave me what I decided was a sarcastic look, but may have been a dirty look or may have been nothing, and said “16 to 17.” Oh. Ooohhhhhh. Oh boy. Nothing like having naked minors running around camp. Great..... all it would take would be one ranger to see that, or one careless pee outside my tent and the permit to summit Katahdin wouldn’t be the only registration list I would end up on! I ate as fast as I could and went back to my tent to go to bed. As I lay there falling asleep, I could hear the latest pop hits resounding from the shelter in chorus. This will be a fun story to relay to my wife....
What an odd day! I was grateful for my first glimpse at Katahdin, grateful that the weather held out, and grateful for such a cool shelter and swimming hole, circumstances aside. Tomorrow I would wake up early to hike to Wadleigh Lean-to, 21.5 miles north.","Carl A. Newhall Shelter

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597197,"Today I played Goldilocks. I meant to hike to Wadleigh Stream Lean-to 21.5 miles away, but I got there at 2 and it was a pretty poor place to camp. The Wilderness has so many ponds and streams to camp by, but Wadleigh stream was just a dry, mosquito-infested creek bed. I signed the shelter log, but with no water and no view, I wanted to move on. I ended up pushing to Rainbow Stream, the next Lean-to, and I still got there by 5:15pm, so not bad for an almost 30 mile day! The Rainbow shelter had a lovely stream right out front and plenty of tent space on the hill behind it. I was happy with my decision, but this also meant one thing - I would be far enough along that I would hike to the Birches tomorrow now instead of Friday. The Birches is the shelter where incoming NOBOs stay at Baxter State Park prior to summiting Katahdin. It’s the Park’s answer to our unpredictable schedules. No one else stays there - only northbounders who  have at minimum hiked the hundred mile wilderness. This meant I would summit Katahdin on Friday instead of Saturday, because we can only stay at The Birches one night. I was ok with this though, partially because we have had great weather lately, so I feel like the longer I wait the more likely it is that the weather could turn. And so that was that. I would walk to the Birches tomorrow and summit Katahdin on Friday the 13th. Hmmmmm.... nothing can go wrong there right? Good thing I’m not superstitious!
The hiking today was great. Lots of the usual Maine roots and rocks, but interspersed with rivers and ponds. I caught a great view of Katahdin over Pemadumcook Lake, and then again later after a short climb up Nesuntabunt Mountain from a viewpoint there. It was a beautiful day of hiking and full of water and views. I also came across a lot of wild blueberries today, though not ripe yet, particularly along the trail by Cooper Pond. 
It was a hot day, and the terrain was pretty easy up until after Wadleigh lean-to. When I got to Rainbow Stream I was impressed with the cascades, and the trail followed it for a while before branching away and then rejoining to cross the stream just in front of the lean-to. I saw Ultra Runner in the shelter, and a new SOBO was there with his dad. I chatted with them while I ate my dinner, and then another pack of SOBOs arrived, looking shiny and new. It was like watching the cycle of life on the trail. I was tired and thin and winding down my hike. They still were clean, had tons of gear and their legs hadn’t eaten all of their upper body muscle yet. They asked me about the Whites, already seeming worried about them. I tried to reassure them and told them they would love the beautiful views, that the my could just go slowly and get food at huts and approach it in bite size pieces. I am not sure if that helped them feel better. Hopefully it did. Of course, they were listening to this from a guy who looked like he had been pooped out of a dumpster and thrown into a tornado, so maybe my appearance didn’t lend credibility to my reassuring tales of how great the Whites are. 
There was nothing left to do but go to bed. This was the last night I would choose where I slept. Tomorrow would be the Birches, and then Friday I would end the day in Millinocket. Just like that. 
I was grateful for all of the views, the continued good weather, and that I could hike a long day and still enjoy my time at camp. In a broader sense, I was grateful that I didn’t have to think too much - I just had to keep walking to the end.","Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597245,"Like many mornings since I got into New Hampshire and farther north, I woke up to the sound of red squirrels chittering away. They seem like such jittery and angry creatures. Their southern cousin, the grey squirrel, is like a relaxed hillbilly, chewing on a piece of straw and every day is his oyster. He looks at you with curiosity and wonderment, and when he does get spooked he runs quietly off to join the other good ole boys. Not the red squirrel! The red squirrel is the nervous, neurotic, two pack a day smoking, obsessive coffee drinker New Yorker. The red squirrel manages multiple slums and is constantly having to make sure his housing projects are in order. We do not belong in his neighborhood, and he shouts at us and to the neighbors about the fact that we are there. The red squirrel spends a lot of time  looking out his window with binoculars assuming the world is going to end. He chitters when I arrive and set up my tent, and when he wakes up and sees my tent in the morning, he chitters again and then smokes some cigarettes while he decides what to do about it. It’s the most annoying sound ever, and yet, Frank pointed out that I will miss it after the trail. I know he is right. I once had a red squirrel yell at me while I was sitting down eating a snack. He then ran up a log nearby and for a minute I thought he might take my snack mix out of my hand. And yet, I will miss them. We don’t have them in Georgia. We have the goofy grey ones, the big hillbilly squirrels that sound bigger than they actually are when they run through the woods. I’ve gotten pretty good about knowing what animal is running away by the sound they make. Grey squirrels, red squirrels, chipmunks, grouse, deer, and moose (the bulldozer of the forest) - I have come to know the sound of their movement, most of the time anyway. I am quite sure I will miss these small details when I am off the trail. For now though, I still had them for another day at least, and I was enjoying them. 
I hiked out of camp about ten minutes before six. I had a lot to do today. My first goal was to get to Abol Bridge and out of the Hundred Mile Wilderness. At Abol Bridge camp store I could resupply with breakfast and snacks for Katahdin tomorrow, as well as eat lunch at their restaurant! Ultra Runner was still in the shelter when I left. She said she planned to summit on Saturday with a friend, but that she was going to the Birches tonight at least. I figured I would see her later. I hiked along at a decent clip. I passed Rainbow campsite and then later passed Frank, who had stealth camped farther north. I said hello and knew I would see him at the restaurant. He was going to summit Friday as well. I got to a slight climb called Rainbow Ledges and saw a ton of wild blueberry bushes. This time I was in luck! I found a few ripe ones and ate some. They were sweet! It was my first time ever eating wild blueberries that I had found. I got another view of Katahdin from the ledges before descending down towards Abol Bridge. I passed by a sign that marked the northern end of the Hundred Mile Wilderness. It was time to leave for the promised land. 
Approaching Abol Bridge you wouldn’t think much of it. It’s a dirty gravel road and the bridge doesn’t look like much beyond its function as a way for vehicles to make it over the West Branch of the Penobscot River. But the minute an AT hiker steps out onto the bridge, Katahdin is visible in all its grandeur, closer than ever before. You can feel its heart beating, taste its dust, and understand it is a force to be reckoned with. It commands respect, and with that view from Arbol Bridge, the fact that I would climb it tomorrow instantly became real. This was happening!
I could taste the finish as I crossed that bridge, particularly when I saw Homebound on the other side talking with one of the Baxter Park rangers. I thought he had already summited, but he would do so tomorrow along with me. It was almost a little emotional seeing another thru hiker there. I guess it was a little emotional. There was a section hiker there with Homebound named Ozzie. He was finishing up his last section and would summit tomorrow as well. Ozzie is a 68 year old Vietnam Vet from Minnesota. He’s the nicest guy and one tough dude! He was all bandaged up from a recent fall and had blood all over one of his legs, but he was just chatting and smiling. 
I went inside to do my last and final mini resupply. I bought unhealthy things. Delicious, unhealthy junk gravitated towards my clutches. It was the kind of shopping you would expect from a death row inmate of it were his last meal and he was 8 years old. I bought a cinnamon bun and a mini lemon pie for breakfast. I bought 4 packs of M&Ms (gotta have some for the summit!), some twizzlers, trail mix and cliff bars. I even bought a pumpkin whoopie pie as a “snack.”  It was ridiculous, but I did it anyway; it was my last hurrah. I purchased a root beer and took it over to the restaurant. I sat next to Homebound at the bar counter and ordered an appetizer of poutine as well as a Reuben panini with potato salad. As I ate the entire thing, every last morsel, we talked about the rest of the day and summiting tomorrow. The ranger ha taken out names down as he was doing an informal count of hikers who would be at The Birches. They only put 12 hikers there, so I am not sure what they do when the bubble rolls through, but tonight we would not have that problem. Next we had to hike into the park, register at a kiosk, hike to the ranger station, pay $10 for The Birches and get a “free” Thru hiker permit to summit Katahdin, and then we could get set up at The Birches, which was near the ranger station. And that’s what we did. 
Frank showed up at the restaurant and we all finished eating. There was just one last detail - ice cream! There was an ice cream window around the side of the store and I got a cone with two scoops. Diabetes here we come! Hopefully not.... Ultra Runner showed up as I was finishing my ice cream. She was headed inside to eat some food. I had thought that I would see her later at The Birches, but she never showed. I think she either decided to go to town to meet her friend, or maybe even camped at Abol. If I’d known she wasn’t going to The Birches, I would have said a proper hiker goodbye. 
We all headed to The Birches at our separate paces, though I walked and talked with Ozzie up to the Park registration kiosk, where we put our names on the list for The Birches. I stopped to get some water from Katahdin Stream, wanting it not just because I was thirsty, but also because of the stream name. And then we were off at separate paces. I enjoyed walking alone. It was time for me to think. Rafters drifted down the Penobscot after a day of whitewater, and I passed many beautiful views of both the river and tributaries feeding into it. I thought about my journey, and how I almost couldn’t believe I was here, at Baxter State Park, finishing. It wasn’t that I doubted I could do it, it’s just that the trip was so long and I focused on just experiencing it one day at a time. But that’s how it goes - one day at a time, one step at a time, and there we are. There I was. By being present in the moments, all of those moments of the journey, the rain, the heat, the cold and the grit, I had somehow made it to the other side. It’s a very different arrival experience than focusing on the end goal every day and worrying about getting there. I felt satisfied, amazed, and almost surprised. 
“I walked across, an empty land. I knew the pathway like the back of my hand. I felt the earth, beneath my feet. Sat by a river it did make me complete.” I felt the desire to sing these words once again, as I had sung them many a day on trail, these lyrics written by Keane. I had gotten to where the trail felt familiar, like an old friend or a comforting sanctuary. Sometimes I felt it most when I retired for the evening, and other times I felt it when the first rays of sun would hit my face, or when a view would surprise me as I moved along my way. “Oh simple thing, where have you gone, I’m getting older and I need something to rely on. So tell me when, you’re gonna let me in. I’m getting tired and I need somewhere to begin.” Sometimes that simple thing feels like it is lost, even on the trail. But it always shows back up in some way if I am patient, and humble, and ask for it to show me on its terms. And, as I’ve said before, perhaps Mick Jagger puts it best: I can’t always get what I want, but if i try sometimes, I might find I get what I need. That simple thing - if I’ve found it on the trail, then I can find it outside the trail. The funny thing about the trail is, it doesn’t end if I keep it alive. I don’t have to be hiking it to feel it. I don’t have to be living on it to connect to something more meaningful, more spiritual. I had these thoughts, and as I sang my songs and walked along, I believed them to be true. I hope they are.
The rest of the trail was a blur. I felt good; I was lost in thought. I know I saw ponds and pretty scenery, and I remember more blueberry bushes, but I had one thing left to do and so I just walked. I got to the Ranger station and checked in with a young Ranger named Justine. She was very friendly and gave me my summit permit. I was the 94th northbound thru hiker to make it to Katahdin and get a summit permit. I saw that Apollo and Skutch had summited yesterday along with others. Justine showed me a bunch of small packs and said i could use those to only hike up with a day pack, or just put some of my stuff in one of them and hike with clean weight in my pack. I picked up s funky looking one and took it to camp to consider using it. The hike up Katahdin was said to be quite difficult due to required bouldering moves in the section leading up to an area called the Tableland before the summit. I felt conflicted though, because up until this point I have always carried my full pack on all of the many mountains I’ve summited. I would think on this. I headed to the Birches. 
When I arrived at camp, Frank and Homebound were there. Frank had started  a fire to keep the mosquitos down. The last fire! I set up my tent and joined them by the fire. It had come down to this. Ozzie made it in a little later. Ultra never showed. It would be the four of us on this last evening on our trek. We talked about a lot of things, including Frank’s triple crown. We talked about pack weight as well. When I said I was thinking about leaving some weight at the ranger station, Frank said “why? You’ve carried it this far.”  I knew then that he was right. I knew it wouldn’t feel genuine to me if I didn’t carry my full pack, and so that decision was made. 
My pack is definitely not as light as it could be, though it is always getting lighter. Sometimes it gets lighter as I let go of the need for things. Sometimes it gets lighter as I consume things, but then heavier again when I resupply. Some things cannot get lighter and must be carried, whether I like it or not. The lighter my pack gets, the happier my hiking is. I feel free with a light pack. There is definitely a point at which getting rid of more would make my experience worse, and perhaps dangerous. I cannot just throw my pack away; I have to carry one. But if I work to make it lighter and keep it lighter, it’s amazing how quickly I can become comfortable with less. My experience on the trail has shown me that my pack is my life, my life is like a pack. I need to clear it of the unnecessary to make room for experience, appreciation, and the joy and satisfaction that come from simplicity and utility. I knew this before the trail, or I thought I did, but the trail has been a real and practical microcosm to give this theory a whirl. I will continue to try and lighten my pack, both on the trail and off.
We took pictures of the last sunset. We told trail stories. We joked about how we were all going to sleep with our food bags in our tents (and we did!). We stared at the fire, listened to each other and the sounds of the forest, each of us with our own thoughts, no doubt, flowing through our minds. We knew what this meant. We knew what we had to do. Frank talked a little bit about life after the trail, since he had the most experience with it. There was something calming about that. Then we all went to bed.
I got in my tent and prepped a few things for the morning. I would write my journal later. Tonight, I would lie back, look at the sky, and breathe in the sights and sounds of the forest. I listened to the little birds that I call the hunger games birds because of their birdsong. I might miss this sound the most. They have been my companions through it all for a while now. As the red squirrels yelled and the birds produced their haunting songs, I drifted off to sleep, grateful for this journey, grateful simply to feel alive.","Rainbow Stream Lean-to

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597249,"It was chilly when I woke at around 4:45am. I got up and ate my lemon pie and cinnamon roll. I know, I know.... I packed up camp and got ready to make the last push, the last summit. Ozzie was already gone. Homebound left a little before me, and Frank was still in his tent when I left. I headed to the Ranger station to return the day pack I would not need and to sign the log book, which I had forgotten to do the day before. I stopped at the sign indicating the direction of the AT to Baxter Peak, the top of Mt. Katahdin and the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. I took a breath. This was it. Now it was time to bring it home. 
The portion of the AT that goes up to Baxter Peak is called the Hunt Trail within the park. It started off quite easy and increased in difficulty until I was bouldering my way along steep slopes and over large rocks, sometimes with a few pieces of rebar in them to use as handholds, or footholds. It was the kind of thing that is outside of my comfort zone, but that other climbs (Palmerton, the Whites, Mahoosic) has prepared me for. The weather was beautiful and there was virtually no wind, which was comforting once I was above treeline. I moved slowly and deliberately, finally climbing, hoisting and shimmying my way up to the Tableland, a plateau just before the final ascent to Baxter Peak. From there it was easy. The views were stunning! The climb leading up to the Tableland and then the views from the plateau were truly breathtaking. This was it - the last mountain to climb! I had one more push to make.
As I walked across the Tableland, I felt relieved to have made it with my pack. It was as light as it could be at this moment in my life, at this point in time, and I carried it over the mountain. I felt good about that. Frank had been right. I heard footsteps behind me and saw what looked to be another NOBO fast approaching. It turned out to be a NOBO named Mainer who finished up last month. He was just out hiking for the day. He said he would see me at the top, offered me a ride to Millinocket afterwards, and flew past towards the summit. The trail really does provide!
I made the last push, and as I nested the summit, Baxter Peak, that iconic wooden sign came into view. I could see Homebound up there, and then Mainer, and I stepped faster, one step at a time, and then I was there. I ran over and kissed the sign. And that was that. 138 days and 2190.9 AT miles later, plus countless more miles from side trails and getting lost, somehow through the kindness and support of others, strangers and loved ones alike, the trail had gotten me here. And what was I to do now? I had finished the trail, but not the journey. This did not come as a surprise. The journey never ends if we keep it alive. I sat up at the summit and thought about this and talked with the guys for a bit. When it was time, I made my way slowly down the mountain, grateful to feel alive.","The Birches Campsite
","Baxter Peak, Mt. Katahdin - AT Northern Terminus","Jul 13, Fri",5.20
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597250,"Mainer was a great guy and actually got a video of me summiting Katahdin, which you can see here if you want to see an excited (and exhausted!) Cat: https://youtu.be/CoMsLblKr6s. I took the Abol trail down Katahdin. I wanted to descend via a different trail to see something new, if possible. Also, Homebound’s parents were coming to meet him at The Abol trailhead and he had offered me a lift to Millinocket, so it made sense to use that trail. Homebound’s parents were incredible generous and amazing and drove Ozzie, Frank, and myself all the way into Millinocket. It was really above and beyond trail magic, and I was incredibly grateful for their kindness. 
This is the trail - the kindness of strangers. It really is an amazing thing. If you’ve read my journal along the way, you’ll know that these were the most impactful moments of my trip. Whether it was the “pro” trail angels like Fresh Ground and Carl, someone who offered me a ride, or just someone out for a day hike who stopped to chat and wished me well or gave me some food, these moments really came to define my AT experience. This trail journal, as well, was a surprising source of strength. I started the journal to record my thoughts and try to document some of my adventures for family and friends. I never really thought about a lot of people I didn’t know reading it. I received so much support (and amazing tips!) from this journal, and that really meant a lot to me and became a key component of my trail experience. It was hard to keep up with the journal, but it was such a rewarding medium and I am very glad that I did. Many nights I could barely stay awake to write, upload and label photos, and often, especially through New Hampshire and Maine, I had no signal to update things. But I stuck with it and you all reading this stuck with me, and for that I am forever grateful. I didn’t always have the energy I wanted to put into my writing; in fact, I seldom did. If you at least enjoyed it a little bit, then that is a win for me. When I realized people were actually taking the time to read it and reach out to me, I made an effort to make it worthwhile, while still being true to myself and documenting my actual experiences. 
If you commented in my guest book, whether it was one time or many, no matter what, I am incredibly grateful for your support. You really helped to keep my morale up when times were tough. For those of you whom I met on the trail, that was an incredibly fun aspect to the journey and the journal as well. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you all for your incredible support and belief in me that I could do this. It took a village and a little fairy dust from the higher power that is Mother Nature, but I got there!
Special thanks has to go to my wife, Gillian. She supported me in doing this from day one, and continued to support me through the trek. While I walked one trail, she walked another - the less fun kind of staying home, working, and holding down the fort while her husband ran around like a crazy man in the woods for 138 days. It’s always easier to be the one on the adventure than the one on the home front, even though it was still hard and I missed her fiercely always. But that’s just who she is - she supports me and my dreams and I do the same for her, and that is why she is the most wonderful wife and partner in crime. Thanks Sweetie! I have to thank my parents as well. They looked after Gillian in their own way and other things while I was gone. There are many people to thank, and I could never name everyone, but you all know who you are. 
I had fun relaxing in Millinocket on Friday. I didn’t comment on my summit date being Friday the thirteenth, but there was definitely a piece of me that enjoyed that coincidence, even though I’m not superstitious. I spent Saturday winding down and catching up on my journal. I got pretty behind in the last week because I could not for the life of me stay awake to write. Tomorrow I am leaving Maine to meet my wife and in laws at the beach! They do a family trip every year and have for years. I didn’t think I would make it this year, but somehow my legs carried me through in time. I’m hoping the salt water will help my feet heal. They hurt and are numb in places - normal thru hiker things. I need to curtail my eating!!! I can’t eat like Hungry Cat anymore. I would like to keep my fit Hiker body, so I will have to work on that. 
Lots of people have asked me what’s next. Well, what isn’t?! Everything comes next if it is not happening now or hasn’t happened already. I’m going to take some more time off work to figure out some stuff there. This trail journal has really kindled my interest in pursuing some writing projects, so I’m going to think through that in the coming weeks. If you enjoyed reading this, I may need some guinea pigs later for other things! I want to spend time with my wife. I also need to win Lucy back, to make sure she favors me again (insert evil laugh). 
As for the AT and this trail journal, I plan to give a post trail update in a few weeks. I took a lot of video on the trail - short snippets every day - and I want to put together a compilation. If I am successful, I will share that when I’m done. So that you don’t have to wonder when I’ll update next, I will post an update by August 4, so you can put that date in your calendars if you are interested in continuing to get updates. 
It was an incredible journey, and I don’t know what getting back to normal life will look like. I guess I’ll find out and let you know! What a great adventure this was though. I would do it all over again in a heartbeat. It was definitely one of the hardest things I have ever done. Even though I had heard other thru hikers say the same thing, I still somehow underestimated just how hard it would be, particularly the physical challenge of hiking every day. It may have been a little easier if I had pushed fewer miles on some days or took more zeros, but thru hiking the AT is a far cry from a mere walk in the woods. I’m incredibly grateful for everything I’ve learned and experienced on this adventure. I certainly learned a ton about backpacking, pack weight reduction (actual and metaphorical!), hiking strategies for weight reduction, and how to eat enough sugar to kill a moose! I also learned a lot about myself and about living life just by taking the leap of quitting a job that wasn’t getting me jazzed every day buy was eating into a lot of my time. I let go of some fears I had around financial insecurity in a way that I wasn’t able to before, and that really helped me to feel free on the trail. I worked too much and didn’t take care of myself. I wasn’t living my life in a healthy way. I hope I don’t make that same mistake again, whatever it is I’m doing. 
Lastly, I got s lot of inspiration by reading David Miller’s book, and quoted him multiple times in my writing. I’m very interested in challenging the status quo, the “norm,” and yet I found it very hard myself to shake away the chains of an average life. Go to school, get a job, make money, get married, buy a house, have kids. Where are the “whys” here? There isn’t enough questioning anymore. “School is good debt.” What?! Really? Always? There are so many social norms that have turned into dangerously universal unfounded quips. I started questioning these things, but in some cases I started too late. I hope that my AT experience has given me a better appreciation for an alternate lifestyle, other ways of living simply and more to really experience life. One life - that’s all we have! At least that’s all I have. If you have more and you’re feeling generous, I’ll take another!
It’s late - way past hiker midnight! Time for this Hungry Cat to hike the trail to dreamland. I’m not afraid to take the next step tomorrow. A Cat always lands on his feet. Besides, I’m going home. And for that, I’m grateful!

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599231,"It feels like the time has just flown since I finished my AT thru hike. After Millinocket, I met my wife and in-laws at the beach in North Carolina’s Outer Banks for a week. The trail continued to provide in Millinocket. A kind thru hiker named Shaggy from a prior year gave Frank (the triple crowner from The Netherlands) and myself a ride to the Bangor airport from Millinocket. As soon as I got through security, I got a text alert that my connecting flight from Newark to Norfolk was canceled, but luckily I was able to hop a flight that was leaving within the half hour…to Chicago! Yep, I flew west and waited at the Chicago airport for much of the day before I could head east again. In the end though, it all worked out – I walked into the rental house in the Outer Banks at midnight, just in time to scare the beejesus out of my wife as she had fallen asleep. I guess it will be an adjustment for her too! She’s had a house and bed to herself for four and a half months.
The Chicago airport was a plunge back into reality for me. The first things I noticed when I exited the plane were that it was noisy, there were people everywhere, and no one seemed to care about each other, simply pushing by to handle their individual agendas. I noticed the distinctive lack of fitness and obesity that seem to be more and more common in our society today. Consumerism was everywhere – shops, shops, and more shops. Some people were dragging piles of luggage, carrying what and going where I have no idea. The whole scene seemed absurd and maniacal. I felt like I was waltzing through some kind of insane asylum where everyone had escaped their individual rooms and were now running about, each living out his and her own individual delusions in concert. It was culture shock to the max! I have experienced this before. I spent roughly 4 years in China and certainly felt restless upon re-entry back in 2003, but for different reasons. And, of course, when I have taken longer vacations from work in the past, particularly if traveling overseas, return has often greeted me with microcosms of culture shock. This was a little different. This time I felt more like Keanu Reaves in The Matrix. I had taken the blue pill. There was no going back. I knew in my heart that I could not just fold back and erase the lessons the trail had taught me, and the freedoms it had bestowed upon my consciousness. As such, I felt like an alien in the crowd, and it would take some time for this feeling to mitigate to where it is today, which is that of an alien who blends in a bit more, but is convinced and determined that he will not return back to some of the thinking and behaviors that trapped him before this grand adventure began. As far as I am concerned, this is a good thing – a positive result! I chose the picture for this journal entry not just because I love the view looking down Katahdin on the climb up, but also because of the caption to the picture and the metaphor therein. 
The week at the beach with Gillian and family was awesome. My legs and feet hurt badly, to the extent that walking on any hard surface without shoes was (and still is, to a lesser degree now) quite painful. We spent most days just relaxing on the beach, enjoying the sea air and waves, catching up on life, telling stories, and getting re-acquainted. I tried to temper my appetite and my craving for processed sugar, but it was a losing battle. My week was peppered with the joy of getting texts from trail friends summiting Katahdin and completing their own hikes. I had to get used to hearing my real name again. I will admit that whenever someone calls me “Hungry Cat” now, it sends synapses of joy through my brain. To me, it will always be a name that represents so much more than just a trail “nickname.” It’s everything I worked for, all of the learnings and lessons the trail bestowed upon me, the people I met along the way and their kindness, and the commitment to confronting fears and making changes – a self-made promise to really live life. Hungry Cat has no limits. Hungry Cat is free from the baggage of the past.  Hungry Cat makes do with less, and enjoys that. Somehow, those two words, that silly nickname, became a chrysalis of promise, hope, strength, kindness, spirituality, and adventure. My trail name contains the highest peaks and the deepest valleys, the winter rains and the warm summer fields. It reminds me that I can be whole; that I don’t have to feel or be “stuck.” I can meet adversity and live in gratitude.

Life at home continues on. I have not even started looking for work, or worrying about what I will do next. I am going to take an “easy does it” approach there. I am lucky that I have time to ease back into things and think about that gradually. I am trying to get back into running, but my feet still hurt and my legs are still stiff, so it is a slower process than I expected. I have not been hiking since I came back to Atlanta, though once in the Outer Banks I walked to the grocery store with my pack and hiked home with the groceries J. I’m sure I will get out on a trail soon.  I was very excited when Gillian and I returned from the beach and little Lucy (our cat) remembered me! I was so worried that she might not, or that she had bonded with my wife and would just ignore me. We have been blessed with the best of both outcomes – she did bond with my wife, but now she just loves us both and spends more time being affectionate with Gillian than she did before I left, which is great! I think Gillian is slowly getting used to having me around the house again too, and we have been enjoying just doing normal things together again. She also grew quite the garden while I was gone!!

I’ve been spending some time thinking about future adventures, mostly for Gillian and I. I won’t deny that I am interested in other long trails, and have been thinking a lot about the PCT here stateside and the Te Aurora in New Zealand. A hiker friend also broached the idea of finishing up the Long Trail in Vermont this year, since we have already hiked about 100 miles of it. I’m thinking about that as well. For the immediate future though I’m just going to enjoy getting back to some normalcy here at home. I picked up a few books, I have some house projects to work on, some travel day-dreaming to do, and I get to enjoy the normal day-to-day with family and friends, which is great! I already had one “plumbing adventure” with my father – the joys of home ownership, a special train in itself! I’m slowly managing to tame my appetite, but definitely looking forward to stepping up my exercise game quite a bit as my legs and feet continue to heal. I hope to continue writing in other capacities now that I won’t have my daily trail journal to maintain. Next week I have to report for jury selection, so I may find myself serving on a jury soon. 
While I was hiking the trail, I took a little snippet of video almost every day. Most of it was just of the trail and the views. I wanted to put together a short compilation so that I could share the trail in a visual way with friends and family, as well as have it as a memory for myself. I managed to finish this and included some photos as well, particularly of friends, hiker acquaintances, and Trail Angels I met along the way. If you would like to watch this, I uploaded it to my video section here on Trail Journals, and here is a direct link to view it on YouTube: https://youtu.be/7qg9m362GoM. Of course, it is set to some of the music that I thought about and wrote about in some of my journal entries J. Putting this video together reminded me, yet again, of how grateful I am for the people I met along the way who really made the journey magical.

I can’t thank everyone enough for the support here on Trail Journals! I really do appreciate each and every entry into my guest book – they have been a mix of fun, memorable, supportive, uplifting, hilarious, kind, and inquisitive, all of which I appreciate! I had another request for a final commentary on gear that I used during the hike, so I added some gear notes as a post script to this journal entry.  What a journey this has been! I will continue to check back from time to time in case anyone still wants to sign the guest book or has any questions for me about gear or otherwise. I do not know what the road in front of me will bring, or where it will lead. Much like the trail, I guess that is half the fun of life! I do know that I am going to try and keep a positive attitude and outlook, and to live every day to its fullest. Perhaps I will write about some of my future adventures. I have really enjoyed the separate journey of trying to describe for other people, in my own twisted way, what I am experiencing. If you have enjoyed reading this as much as I have enjoyed writing it, then I guess I have met what became a goal of sorts. I hope you all enjoy your own journeys and trails through life, whether they lead into the woods, or through other places. If you are trying to get up the courage to have your own adventure, or if it seems like it is too hard to make it fit into life, then I would encourage and challenge you to get into action. Only YOU can make it happen! It won’t just happen for you. Dreaming and planning will never be a substitute for doing. The hardest part for me was making that actual leap. Once I left my job and took the action to set myself on a course of committing to the trail, the rest was quite easy and enjoyable! Of course, my path was a bit drastic. Not every adventure needs to be a thru hike, or requires leaving gainful employment. Define your own adventures and live your own dreams!

Life is an adventure; life is a trail. Enjoying the present day is the easiest way for me to continue the adventure, or to start a new one. I don’t know what excitement may come in the future, but I know what I am going to do right now. Right now, I’m going to go for a little walk with my wife and see where it leads….
Postscript:
#1 – Gear Review. Here are a few final comments on some of the major gear areas where I either made changes or have strong opinions.

Pack – I started with an Osprey and changed out to a Zpacks Arc Haul in Virginia. I am so glad I switched! The Osprey was fine, but it was heavier and noisy and held a lot of water weight when it rained. I loved the lightweight, waterproof, quiet design of the Zpacks. It was totally worth the money!

Clothing – Overall I was happy with my clothing choices. In the end, I was hiking in the same smartwool T-shirt and running shorts with built-in underwear every day. I loved the wool t-shirt because it could get filthy and it never really smelled that bad! I liked the one piece of the shorts with built-in underwear. In addition to these items, I carried a smart wool quarter zip long sleeve shirt and a pair of Prana water-wicking pants to the end. I also kept a light silk base layer top for cooler higher altitude nights.  I would change this and probably ditch the pants for lighter weight tights, and ditch the quarter zip smart wool for something like a button down lightweight Columbia long sleeve shirt. Why? The wool was too heavy for when I was awake, and I had the light base layer for sleeping if I needed it. If I had utilized a button-down long sleeve shirt I probably could have gotten rid of the base layer top as the weather got warmer because I still had my precipitation jacket for warmth, as well as my puffy. The pants were just bulky and I hardly wore them. Tights would have been more versatile. I carried my rain pants until the end. I would definitely keep my rain jacket, but next time I will ditch my rain pants in warm weather. They are just too hot to deal with, and I didn’t really need them as a warmth layer. They were too warm to be versatile once the weather heated up, but were great during the winter and I would carry them again in the winter in a heartbeat! As for my head, I loved my buff and will always bring that on future trips. I also loved hiking with my mesh hat – it became a must-have item for me! I finished the hike with two pairs of socks and sock liners and that combination worked well for the entire hike. 
Cook System  - My stove worked fine (Snowpeak Litemax). In the future I might try the even lighter BRS, but my Snowpeak was fine. I liked my Snowpeak 700mL cookpot as well, but the lid drove me crazy. The lid just sits loose in the mesh stuff sack, and so it would always slide around. Eventually the mesh sack broke, and so the lid would get loose in my pack. I will probably look for a strong rubber band to replace that. I’m interested in the Titanium BOT  cookpot with the top that screws on, both so I don’t have to think about the lid getting loose and also for cold soaking. But, for now, the Snowpeak will be fine if I find a band to contain the lid. Cook pouch – I would use this again. It was cheap to make and I used it most nights so that I didn’t have to clean my cookpot. I would NOT bring a pot cozy again. I made one and brought it, but stopped using it because I wasn’t cooking in my pot. Also, it was only really useful for the winter anyway. I nixed it eventually. Lastly, I am interested in experimenting with homemade alcohol stoves, and may work on one of those soon. I will thank Lucy in advance for her contribution of a cat food can to get started J.

Sleeping bag – I used the same Western Mountaineering 20 degree ultralite bag the entire trip. It was too hot on the warm nights, but I just opened it up. I love this bag. If I could get this performance in a lighter bag, I would try it.

Footwear – No boots. Probably not ever again! If I were solely doing some kind of snow expedition, I might look at boots, but otherwise they are a firm “no” for me. Trail runners were much better at keeping my feet cool and comfortable, as well as drying out. I liked the popular Altra Lone Peak 3.5 and went through two pairs, but ultimately I wished I had hiked more in the Altra Olympus 3.0s. I hiked the last 150 miles in the Olympus model and LOVED it. It is much more padded than the 3.5s, but has a lot of the same great features (breathability, gaiter trap, zero drop). The 3.5s just weren’t enough cushioning for me on the Pennsylvania rocks, and then again not enough for the rocks in NH and ME. So far I’m a fan of the Olympus and plan to continue hiking in them to see how they continue to perform. Camp shoes – I ditched my crocs and had no camp shoes for a while, then regretted that when I got to Rangely, ME and my feet were wet, but I had no alternative footwear for town. I picked up a $2 pair of flip flops there and those worked great! I think they will be my go-to camp and town shoe. They are much more compact than crocs, lighter, and I used them to ford a few streams without issue.  Lastly, I loved wearing gaiters and they have become a “must” for me. Dirty Girl Gaiters all the way!!!

Water filtration  - The Sawyer squeeze (not the mini! Don’t do that to yourself…the flow rate is painful) worked great for me. I used the CNOC reservoir bag and LOVED it. I didn’t have any issues until the bag developed a pinhole towards the end. It was odd and CNOC had FANTASTIC service and sent me another one on the trail. That one then had a hole as well and they sent me yet another one. The pinholes were odd and I haven’t heard of other folks having this problem. Otherwise, the bags were great and much better than Sawyer. Towards the end of the hike I kept one 1L Smartwater (or Lifewater) bottle with clean water and one with dirty water that I screwed my filter directly into. This enabled for quick gathering while hiking, but a way to have clean water in a bottle if I wanted to use electrolytes or some kind of drink additive. I would do this again. Along with my CNOC water bladder, I had a total carrying capacity of 4L. Most days I tried not to hike with more than 1L at any given time.

Tent – the Big Agnes Flycreek HVUL2 was ok. It wasn’t the best in high wind, and I didn’t like Big Agnes’ (or REI’s) service (or lack thereof) when I had an issue with the shock cord inside the tent poles breaking. In the future, I would like to try going lighter and using a single-walled tent like the Zpacks Duplex. They are expensive though….

That’s it for a gear rundown! The one thing I learned was that doing without and hiking with less weight almost always outweighed the comfort of having whatever item it was that I didn’t absolutely need. A lighter pack really helped me enjoy the trail that much more! If you are trying to decide whether to bring something, think about whether you really truly need it. Does it have multiple uses? You’ll be walking 90% of the time. Is it worth carrying it through the 90% of the time you’re hiking if you’re only using it occasionally? Consider these questions to help yourself make gear decisions. I definitely plan to try to keep getting lighter and lighter as I move forward. In some ways, that is a metaphor for the rest of my life as well. The lighter my “pack,” the happier I seem to be!",,View Entry,"Aug 03, Fri",0
Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600442,"Hello all! I realize most folks are not expecting me to post again, but I wanted to share a great article with you all and answer a few questions.
My wife, Gillian, wrote an excellent article for The Trek about supporting a thru hiker. There is plenty of information for thru hikers about thru hiking and what to expect upon return, but seldom do we hear about the journeys, experiences, and struggles of those back home who support us in our dreams. Check it out: https://thetrek.co/survive-par... I am sure this will be useful for some of you as supporters, or if you are working with your loved ones to prepare collaboratively for your time away.
Just to answer a few questions/observations from my guest book:
@David Levy - I didn't mention electronics because I commented quite a bit about how my signal with AT&T wasn't great. That said, I wasn't trying to do any kind of Vlog or anything fancy like that, so I didn't need much. I liked my Anker power bank and that worked fine for me the entire trail. I never ended up with my phone being completely dead. I hardly made any phone calls from the trail itself. I passed people who were calling loved ones every day to check in. I did not do that. Instead, where I had a signal I would text my wife. It worked for us. If cell coverage is important, then Verizon is the way to go. It's the better network overall on the trail. As for me not showing trail angels or other hikers in my video, while I didn't video record them, there were plenty of shots in the video itself from pictures that I took. I captured many of the Trail Angels and my hiker friends in some photos at the end of the video. Anyway, the video was originally only going to be the trail, and then I decided to expand it to include some views, and then I decided I wanted to include some people as well. I didn't film people because I was trying to focus on engaging with them. I just didn't want those moments to be cluttered with worrying about filming. I did consider this at one point, thinking it would be fun to have some video of camp, but then I decided that I wanted those interactions to be private. It's just my style. I'm sure i could have if I had asked the people with me, but we were all kind of out there trying to be in nature and live in the moment, and a camera always takes away from that a little bit. It's unavoidable. I didn't get pictures of all the people and Trail Angels I met, but I did get many. I never flinched when I saw other hikers shooting video - it's normal now and many hikers use YouTube to document their thru hikes. Everyone I ran into was very respectful about it, and most hikers don't mind being filmed if they consent to it, just like anyone being filmed anywhere really.
@Andy - Good question. If I had to pick only one guide, it would definitely be Guthook for the simple reason that I always knew where I was, and therefore where everything else was relevant to me. I liked having both because I found AWOL nice for towns with its maps, and the two guides sometimes had different campsites and water sources listed. In the end, I largely used Guthook for everything and AWOL for supplemental town information. That said, one flaw of Guthook is that sometimes I would look at my distance from things like towns, and it was almost like it would measure it as the crow flies versus trail distances. I liked having AWOL to double check distances and mileage because I did get burnt by this flaw of Guthook's on one occasion. If i were to hike the rest of the Long Trail or the PCT, I would use Guthook again. 
Thanks everyone again for the lovely comments in my guestbook! I'm honored by the compliments!

Hungry Cat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608891,"Well folks, the hat is back and so is Hungry Cat!I'm posting this in my Appalachian Trail Journal, but in less than a month here in April 2019 I will be starting a northbound thru-hike of the Continental Divide Trail!!If you enjoyed this Appalachian Trail Journal and want to follow me on my thru-hike of the CDT, here's the scoop.I started a trail journal for the CDT hike, but in parallel I was already working on a project to build out my own blog site. Why? I will always have a special place in my heart for trailjournals.com, but the site was a bit difficult for me to update in the field last year. I also struggled with it being so difficult to add more than one photo in a journal entry, and in general, the photo functionality was lacking. At the same time, I have a desire to do more with my writing, adventuring, and budding video production. Over the last year I've loved having a creative outlet, and having my own website gives me a place to keep everything centralized, the way I want it to look and feel. I also wanted a site where people could truly subscribe for updates. With Trail Journals, your options are either to just keep checking back, or to subscribe for RSS feeds if you use a feed reader. Neither are very precise ways to follow along. I wanted readers to be able to get notifications when I make a new post. No notification? No need to waste time checking for new posts!If you are interested in following my CDT thru hike, check out my website, Unfettered Footsteps, at www.UnfetteredFootsteps.com.There you will also get access to all of my social media channels. I plan to cover a wider spectrum this year on the CDT hike, utilizing not only my blog, but Instagram, Facebook, and even YouTube for some videos. I will have occasional video updates, and when the hike is done I will be making a video series on the entire hike. Hopefully I will make it all the way to Canada! Canada or bust, as they say....I so appreciated all of your support and for sticking with me on the AT hike. It made it so much fun, especially when I got to actually meet folks on the trail. I'd love to have you all along for the CDT hike and future adventures at UnfetteredFootsteps.com!",,View Entry,"Mar 26, Tue",0
