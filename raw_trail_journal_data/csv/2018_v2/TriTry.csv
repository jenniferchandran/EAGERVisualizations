TriTry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583450,"Why the trail name TriTry; because this will be my third attempt to thru hike the Appalachian Trail. I learned a lot from the first two times and have hopefully corrected all my mistakes from the first two attempts. The first time I attempted to hike the AT was in 2011 with my two sons, Schuyler and Tony who were then 14 and 15. We only made it about 40 miles from Springer Mountain to Hogpen gap just past Neels Gap. For all the reading and studying and planning, I was not mentally prepared and neither were Tony and Schuyler. I quite, mainly because I was worried about their safety. All that being said, I believe everything happens for a reason and some major life changing events happened after we got back home. I enrolled in the RCIA program at the nearby Catholic Church and enrolled Tony and Schuyler in confirmation classes. I also applied and got accepted in the Nursing program at Wayland Baptist University that same year. I received my BSN February 2014. None of this would have happened if I had not followed my heart and left the trail when I did.
However, I still felt the Appalachian Trail tugging at my heart strings. I had to complete a thru-hike. So, for the year prior to me graduating from Nursing school, I planned my second attempt to hike the AT. My graduating Nursing school in February was perfect timing. It would just be my older son Tony and I, though. Schuyler made it perfectly clear he had no desire to hike for 6 months and I could see that mentally he was not capable of it. I wanted to start in March 2014 but we were unable to start until April 15, 2014, due to the boys Confirmation being scheduled April 11. I made adjustments to our gear and eliminated about 10 extra pounds to increase our chances of success. But, I did not count on my conscience getting the better of me. I felt guilty for the money were spending and knowing that I would be making pretty good money as a nurse, but was relying on my husband, Sam's, sole support. I just couldn't in good conscience keep hiking, expecting Sam to shoulder the whole financial burden and digging us in a bigger hole. He never said a negative word, but since I am the one that does the bills, I could see the writing on the wall. However, this time we hiked approximately 273 miles, starting from the Approach Trail and hiking to Hot Springs, NC. So, I rented a care and we drove home. As I said everything happens for a reason. We arrived back home toward the end of May and I took that time resume homeschool our sons who have learning disabilities and to work up the nerve to apply for a nursing job. Sam, being the wonderful husband he is, gave me the kick in the pants I needed to get over my fear apply for job. The question was where was I going to apply. All I can say is in all of this I see God's hand, because I believe sometime during the Summer one of my fellow classmates invited me to lunch and encouraged me to apply where she worked, at University Hospital in San Antonio. Thank you Karen! I finally got off my butt and applied for 10 different positions at UH, the maximum number a person could apply for at a time. I didn't not expect to hear anything and was waiting to the two weeks to be up to put in more applications. On of the job openings was for Peds, which would have been my last choice, but they are the ones who called me for an interview and I was hired. Big surprise time me! I have now been working there for 3 years and 3 months  and I can not imagine working as anything other than a pediatric nurse. During this whole time, I still maintained a strong desire to hike the AT, but never dreamed Sam would be okay we me trying a third time, but being the wonderful husband he is he supports my dream and even came up with my trail name. He did say that I could not come home this time until I completed the trail, thought :) . 
So, Tony and I are about to embark on our third attempt in two weeks. I can not wait. I am doing this blog for me, my family, my friends, and co workers who want to follow my adventure. I will post information and pictures about gear in the coming days.

I’ve been reading other people’s journals that are already hiking and now I really can’t wait to begin this adventure. Last time I did more for Tony, who his dad has given him the trail name tootsie roll based on the color of his sleeping bag, than I should have. As a result, the past few days I have had him practice setting up his tent and taking it down and also packing his sleeping bag into his stuff sack. He has never been diagnosed as autistic, but he does have some of the symptoms of being autistic, such as being somewhat socially awkward. He had significant global learning delays in school but he does have a good sense of direction. He does not like the trail name his dad gave him, but I think that is better than grumpy, which he is most of the time, at home anyway.Four more days til we fly to Georgia and 6 more until we start our hike.“Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference.“ Robert Frost",,View Entry,"Mar 09, Fri",0
TriTry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584098,"We left home yesterday and are spending a couple of nights in a lodge to recoup from a full day of traveling. I get motion sickness and traveling by plane, train and an automobile was very rough on my stomach. So hiking is the perfect mode of transportation for me for the next 6 or so months.
it seems no matter how old I get or how many times I’ve been away from my family, the first few days I am so incredibly homesick. Even having my older son, Tony with me I still miss Sam, my husband, and Schuyler, my younger son so much I actually feel sick at my stomach. I also have two dogs, Trixie and Dandy and a cat named Martini that I miss. I am also a worrier, although I’ve gotten a lot better. 
I know once we have the first week done, I’ll feel a lot better, it’s just getting started. First week in basic training was the worst, first week of each quarter of nursing school, first week off orientation as a Peds nurse we’re nerve wracking. And then I can’t count the times I’ve moved from the time I was a kid to now, how stressful those times were. Funny thing is I hate staying in one place too long. I like to travel and move around and do adventurous things. When we visited Germany for a week, one day we went paragliding, which I had always wanted to do, but actually running along the mountain ridge, I was so nervous, but once we took flight it was awesome. 
We start out hike tomorrow and I can’t wait but at the same time I’m nervous. You would think this being the third time I wouldn’t be. 
I just remembered I have the peace you gave me Melody and I will be carrying it with me everyday. Thank you friend, just remembering that makes me feel better.

We did not meet very many people today. Only 5 people passed us and then we met another guy whom we leap froged most of the day. Only a handful of people are staying at this shelter including a Ridge Runner who is making sure people are following the leave no trace policy on the trail and who is available to help and give advice to any hiker who needs it. It is getting colder and I’m exhausted so I am going to turn in, but will try to write more in the morning and add a picture.

TriTry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584245,"We had another glorious day of hiking. We stopped at Long Creek Falls for about 30 minutes. I’ll post a picture later. Tony lost steam the last half of the hike because he couldn’t eat enough calories this morning because his stomach was upset due to nerves. I was through too by time we reached the shelter. My legs hurt so bad and I have a blister on my big toe and one on my little toe. We hiked most of the day with a guy from Ohio. He has nine kids and some grandkids.
Others I have met are One Step, Okey180, from of course Oklahoma, Tom, and two girls that provided our first trail magic on the trail. by giving up their spots on the first floor of the shelter and moving to the second deck. Our actual first trail magic was when Donald and Mary shuttled us to the Amicalola lodge and gave us a canister of fuel and treated us to supper at Cracker Barrel.
We are sleeping in the shelter tonight because they expect thunderstorms tonight and tomorrow.

We reached the shelter at 430 and Tony rested until 530 when we ate Ramon noddles and I had a cup of lemon tea.

If I could have carried his pack for him, I would have. Thankfully though trail magic and angels shined on us today. A church group that comes out once a year to provide trail magic at Woody Gap just happened to be there today. One of their members was hiking up to Gooch Mountain Shelter giving away free hotdogs. We met him about a mile from the Gap and he saw how bad Tony looked and carried his pack down to the Gap for him. Thank you Kyle. Glenloch Baptist Church was handing out hotdogs, chips, sodas, cookies, chili, brownies and ice cream to hungry hikers. I ate one of the hot dogs, some chips and had a coke. Tony only had a coke. 
I knew Tony could not hike anymore today or tomorrow, so I called one of the shuttle drivers from Suches and he brought Tony and I to Dahlonega to a motel. So the plan is to zero tomorrow and then slack pack Tuesday and possibly Wednesday. I’ll see how Tony does Tuesday. 
We enjoyed some gorgeous views from Ramrock Mountain or at least I did. Thanks to all who have signed the guest book and the words of encouragement.P.S.   Trail magic - defined as an unexpected act of kindness, is a quintessential part of the Appalachian Trail experience for many long-distance hikers.A Trail Angel is defined as someone who provides help, transportation, lodging, or food to a hiker. Many times these random acts of kindness are what it takes for a hiker to pull through and continue on their journey when they feel like they have reached their breaking point.Zero day – A zero-mileage day. These are important periodically for healing and recharging. If a zero day is taken in a town, it often includes resupplying food, eating, repairing gear, doing laundry, and more eating.

TriTry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584484,"It figures I could have slept as late as I wanted this morning, but I was awake at 645 and couldn’t go back to sleep. So I did my morning prayers and read some, showered and then Tony and I went to Dunkin Donuts for breakfast and then we walked just over half a mile to the Walmart to Resupply. We got back to the room around 1045 and just hung out watching the weather channel until about 1200. We went to Dairy Queen for lunch but we just got a small meal as neither one of us had our usual appetite. Rested more, cleaned some of the gear and took inventory of what we have and will try to send some stuff home. My pack is entirely too heavy, so I am really evaluating what I can live without. The biggest thing is for at least the next month or two we need to keep some of our heavier winter gear to be safe. Tony seems to be doing better today but we will find out for sure tomorrow when we hike around 11 miles. We are doing what is called slack packing.
Slackpacking means we are basically leaving most of our gear at the hotel and having somebody drive us back to where we got off yesterday and then they  will pick us back up after we have hiked to our destination and bring us back to the hotel. Will will be carrying a small light weight pack with snacks, water bladder, water filtration system and some winter gear as snow is expected on the mountain we are hiking tomorrow.
The person giving us a ride tomorrow asked if we we sure about hiking tomorrow. I’m not really, but I said yes because if we only hike in good weather we will never reach Maine and we do have a nice warm motel room to come back to.No rain, or in this case snow and cold, no pain, no Maine.","

TriTry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584530,"We were supposed to be on the trail by nine this morning, but our ride did not show up because of the bad weather forecast today and the fog. Another thru hiker was also at our hotel and was getting a ride back to Woody Gap, so we caught a ride with his shuttle driver and were on the trail by 945. The fog had completely lifted by then, and we had beautiful hiking weather, not too hot or cold and the rain held off for the most part. 
We hiked about a 2 a mile an hour pace without our packs. We saw some great views but we also saw a lot of damage created by Hurricane Irma, a lot of trees down. We didn’t see very many people on the trail, only 6 other thru hikers. One of them also slack packed today as well. 
We stopped at Woods Hole Shelter for lunch but didn’t hang out there very long because there were two guys sleeping in the shelter covered with their sleeping bags. One had a dog. It looked like they were living there. The gear they had did not look appropriate for a thru hike. I ate a peanut butter sandwich and Tony had a tangerine and some fruit bites. He couldn’t eat anything else. Anyway we ate quickly and got out of there. 
Then we climbed Blood Mountain and had sunshine, some rain and sleet, but for the most part it was partly cloudy all day. The hike down hill, last 1.5 miles of Blood Mountain did me in. My glutes, thighs, hips, knees, calves and feet are killing me. But we hiked 11 miles in 7 hours. Our ride picked us up and we were back at the motel by 530. I took s shower and bath to help my sore muscles and then we went to McDonald’s and Tony ate great and kept it down, 14 chicken nuggets, one plain cheese burger, large fries and half a McFlurry.
We are going to do a 7 mike slack pack tomorrow to prevent from having to hike over 11 miles with our pack. I had not planned this but you do what you have to do to keep hiking and not get injured or run down too much.","Woody Gap

TriTry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584614,"We woke up around 7 this morning. I slept straight through night. The hike yesterday really wore me out even without a pack. I laid in bed for half an hour then went and got us Dunkin Donuts for breakfast. Our shuttle driver picked us up around 930 and we got to Neels Gap around 1000. I mailed some stuff home and we began hiking at 1030. 
The temperature was around 28 degrees when the wind wasn’t blowing. The scene reminded me of a Christmas winter Wonderland. The pictures don’t even begin to capture the beauty. However, going downhill was treacherous because the path is very rocky and the moisture made for a very slick surface. We took our time though and fortunately there were no falls.
We were supposed to hike to Hogpen Gap and get picked up but when I called our shuttle driver about 2 miles from our destination he said that we would be stuck waiting for a while as he was shuttling someone else, but he said he would be driving my Testnatee Gap soon and we were only a mile away from it. So we got picked up there at 130 then spent the next 2 plus hours on winding roads because two of his passengers had to be dropped off at the Springer Mountain parking lot. I don’t know how but I managed not to get motion sickness. Tony managed his motion sickness until after we got dropped off at Dairy Queen at about 4. He was still able to eat two cheese burgers and some fries. 
We got back to our room around 5 and I enjoyed a hot shower and then packed up our stuff and then relaxed. We had a snack from McDonald’s around 7 and the came back and watched one of Back to the Future movies. Tony’s never seen them before now and he said he wants to watch all of them from the beginning.
So the purist AT thru hikers won’t like this but we are going with our original plan of being dropped off at Hogpen Gap, but I’m doing what I have to to keep up moral and Tony made the point he had already climbed Wildcat Mountain twice, so we will not be doing that 1 mile segment.

We ate snacks as we walked. There are a lot more people on the trail; at least 8 or 9 people passed us. A couple passed us that looked like they were ultralight hiking. The girl was wearing just a t shift and shorts and I do not know how she didn’t freeze. Most of the people at the shelter tonight are young and hiked over 11 miles from Neels Gap. On guy, Patch, hiked 16 miles from Jarred Gap. I didn’t really get anyone else name. I’m sure we will not see this group of hikers again after tomorrow. 
We got to the shelter around 230 and had s peanut butter sandwich, pringles, and a tangerine. I had a cup of coffee. And then we ate our supper of Ramon noodles and had some got chocolate. We crawled in our tent around 639 on because it was getting colder. It was 48 degrees when we got to the shelter, but the wild made it feel colder. It is supposed to get down to 32 tonight, so I’m sleeping with our electronics and water filter to hopefully keep them from freezing.
Tony did well today but we did only hike 4.6 miles. We thought about going to the next shelter but it was 7 miles away and we probably wouldn’t have reached it until 7 when it would have been colder. I think we made a good decision.","Hog Pen Gap

I woke up shortly before 7 and started packing up my sleeping bag and sleeping pad and pillow and then I told Tony he needed to wake up. He was not happy, so I took the tent fly off and folded it and then went to get our food bags off the cables. When I got back he was awake, so then we got his stuff packed up and the rest of the tent taken down and packed. I hurried as fast as I could in order to start hiking to warm up. We did not eat breakfast and we both wore out thermal underwear. We finally set out at 820. I’ve got to figure out how to break camp faster.
I took some pictures of the icicles we saw. We hiked pretty fast for the first 3 miles to warm up. It warmed up enough around 11 so we could stop and eat lunch, Tony ate a honey sandwich and me a peanut butter sandwich. Then it got cold again. The last mile and a half was brutal with hiking over a bolder field and tree roots. We made it to the shelter around 1. It was early to stop but our next shelter was more than 8 miles away and there is no way my feet or back could tolerate a 15 mile day yet.
There was a guy here already, who was taking a zero waiting for someone to catch up to him. He cleaned out the fire pit and had it already to go when more hikers rolled in, so I am standing by a nice warm fire as I type this. There are now about 15 people here. The only name I’ve got so far is Po the character from King fu Panda.
I’m so happy Tony has an appetite now, he ate two things of Ramon noodles, a pop tart and some fruit snacks.

TriTry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584912,"I don’t even know where to start. Okay I’ll guess I’ll start with when we got up. We got up at 7 and packed up and started hiking by 8:20. We had a steep walk down Blue Mountain. When we got down to Unicoi Gap, some trail magic. Our trail angels had not had a chance to set up the grill and start cooking but they gave us what they could which was hostess donuts. We told them we were thinks about stopping at Tray Mountain Shelter, but one of the women said she recommended we not stay there with the weather coming in. That said it would get very cold and windy, setting on top of a mountain. So we made the very foolish decision to hike to Deep Gap Shelter.
As any hiker will tell you Gap becomes a dirty word. Why you ask? Because this usually means a long steep climb. We began the roller coaster coming down Blue Mountain and then climbing up Rocky Mountain and then down to Indian Gap, were we saw the best sight hungry hikers could see, a family providing trail magic in the form of BBQ sandwiches, vegetable soup, chips, cookies and a variety of drinks and a chairs to sit in. We thought that would be enough to help us make it to our destination. Then of course we began the climb up some unknown mountain and then down again to Tray Gap and then up Tray Mountain. We took a short break at the sign for Tray Mountain Shelter, but it was already 2:30 and we had 7 more miles to go, so we tried to kick into high gear which lasted only one mile. We had 6 more miles to go and were flagging quickly. Oh, and did I mention we had rain threatening us the entire day. We did get sprinkled on. By 4 miles to go we were both dying. We came down Tray Mountain and went up and down some more but we had one more big climb ahead of us, Kelly Knob, a mile straight up and a mile straight down. That was our last two miles before we reached the shelter. 
We staggered up to the shelter around 7:30, and of course there was not room for both of us in the shelter. Tony virtually collapsed on the shelter step and I quickly got about the business of setting up the tent, when another trail angel, named Laura, appeared before me and offered to help me set up the tent. We quickly got it set up and she asked what else she could do to help, if we wanted her to cook anything. Tony and I neither one had any appetite, though. We just wanted to go to sleep. Laura was kind enough to filter us water while I continued to get stuff organized in our tent. When she got back it started raining so I quickly put our packs in the tent and finished unpacking. Then I had to go put our bear bags in the bear box. I got back to our tent and was getting ready to go to sleep when I saw my coffee filtering thing. I smelled it and it definitely smelled like food so I got back out in the rain and put it in the bear bag.I crawled back in the tent and called a hotel to see if they had a room for Sunday and they did. I then scheduled a shuttle to pick us up at 10:00 the next morning. And then I tried calling my husband, Sam. I then attempted to go to sleep but my legs shook for about 30 minutes. It rained really hard off and on the whole night. But we remained dry.","Blue Mountain Shelter

I love being in the mountains and seeing the gorgeous views and have moments of feeling intensely blessed and other times the weather freaks me out which is what caused me to push too far Saturday. I feel like sometimes I need to hurry too to fit in everything I want to accomplish. The biggest thing I learned by pushing to do so many miles Saturday, is that I need to slow down, relax, take it easy, and most of all listen to my body when it is telling me we need to stop. I enjoy myself more when we start hiking around 9 and stop by 4:30 and when we can stop and enjoy our surroundings and take time to take pictures. I didn’t get very many pictures Saturday because I was so worried about getting to our destination before dark. The last 6 miles of the hike were absolute misery for both of us. A book I read from another thru hiker said it is about the smiles not the miles. I think from here on out if I follow that policy, we will be much happier.","

We got up an hour later than usual, hoping it would get warmer, but it didn’t, so we packed up as quickly as possible and fixed something warm to drink. I started out wearing my long underwear and two pairs of socks. Tony took off about 15 minutes before I did and I took of about 10 minutes before Nemo and Joe to thaw out my poor toes.
About 30 minutes into the hike I was thawing out and removed my hoodie. That’s when Nemo and Joe caught up with me and we hiked together for the rest of the day. We caught up with Tony at approximately 2.5 miles. He had stopped because he wanted to make sure we didn’t miss a short turnoff to a spectacular view. Then we hiked to, I think Betty’s Creek campsite where I removed my long underwear. As long as we were hiking, we were warm. Then we came to a road crossing and saw the most wonderful site: trail angels providing trail magic: Easter eggs, fresh fruits and veggies and candy. The boiled egg was awesome. Thank you, Caroline and Chris. We also met Nurp, Wet Sticks and Goosebumps here and leap frogged them the rest of the day. We reached Albert Mountain shortly afterwards and this mountain is no joke. There is a part you literally have to climb over boulders and can’t use the hiking poles. We were treated to wonderful view at the top and we climbed the fire tower and got our trail family picture taken. Tony took off again about 20 minutes before me.

We were able to get a cabin that sleeps 7 people and split the cost four ways. We are sharing the cabin with Nemo, Joe, and Popa Jay.

I slept with my gloves so they would be nice and warm when I put them in this morning. I woke up at around 7:15 and sat in my sleeping bag for about 10 minutes, dreading getting out in the cold, but it wasn’t too bad as long as I was packing. I got all my stuff packed up and fixed me some hot chocolate and ate 3 powdered donuts while Tony slept in. Then we got Tony’s stuff all packed up and started hiking so my feet would thaw out. 
We got up to the trail and I saw the most beautiful sight, ice crystals frozen on all the vegetation. I almost did t take pictures because my fingers and whole body were so cold, but I knew I would regret it if I didn’t. So I pulled out my phone and quickly took the pictures and got hiking. By time we reach Choah Bald my feet had thawed. We took off our packs and enjoyed the gorgeous view for about 15 minutes and then resumed hiking to stay warm. This is when the day started going down hill, no pun intended. I stomach was hurting so bad I could not cinch the waist strap as tight as it should have been. I figured the discomfort would go away but it only got worse and along with that I became so exhausted that I was walking like a slug and felt like if I sat down at all I would have been asleep in minutes.
About 5 miles from the road crossing, another hiker passed us and said there was trail magic at this crossing. This was not even able to motivate me to hike faster. It felt more like 10 miles than 5. The downs really killed me because they were step and each step hurt the blister on my little toe and jarred my stomach, making it feel like I was being punched in the gut.
But we finally made it to the road and we had a hot dog and a banana, along with some cookies. I was hoping the food would make me feel better, but it didn’t. So the daughter of our wonderful trail angels, Shelby, drive us to the Quality Inn in Robbinsville, NC. Thank you Shelby! We got out room and I showered, hoping that would make me feel better, but it didn’t. Sam called me and I let him know what was going on. Then I walked over to McDonald’s with Tony and had another bite to eat. Then we went to Ingles to get a few items. I’m feeling a little better, but still feeling really tired. I was planning on a couple of zeros at the Fontana Dam Lodge, but I think I’m going to have to use one of those tomorrow.
If it’s not Tony, it is me slowing the progress of our hike. It is a little frustrating, but with this terrain it is dangerous to go beyond when your body is telling you it needs a break, even if you’ve had a break not too long ago.

I woke up around 7 and my feet were too cold to stay in in the sleeping bag any longer. I knew the best thing to do was to get up and moving, I’m not sure of the exact temperature, but I know it was below 25. There was also about 2 inches of snow on the ground and it was still snowing. I rapid started packing up my sleeping bag and mat, then I had to take a break and warm my frozen fingers under my arm pits.

While he was starting the fire I went to get our bear bags which were froze to the cables and I really had to work to get them down. By then my fingers were froze again, so I too a second to warm them by the fire and then our big bear bag that I store the things the two smaller ones won’t fit, was frozen so I couldn’t open it. It took me at least ten minutes to melt the ice enough to unclip it. Then of course I had to warm my fingers again. By this time Tony was up and we got his sleeping bag and pad packed up. Then I started packing up the extra clothes and other items and made hot chocolate to warm our insides. Then I went and got water for our hike. We did not leave the shelter until 10.
The plan was to hike to Mt Collins Shelter and stop at Double Springs Shelter to eat which was 1.7 miles. However, when we got to the shelter no one was around and the weather was not conducive to stopping for any length of time, so we hiked on. We got to the turn off for Clingmans Dome, but opted to pass it up as we were freezing even hiking. The windchill had to be in the single digits.

I was very thankful to have some shelter, but I can’t say I wasn’t disappointed not to be sleeping a nice warm hotel bed.

There are many other blessings we have, but I think they all essentially fall somewhere under these five. I think part of the trail experience is enjoying the trail towns and the people who live in these towns. I have enjoyed every town we have been in so far, but I would say as of right now my favorite is Hiawassee, GA. I am also blessed because up until this past Sunday, we have had great weather for all the places that are known for having great vistas. Unfortunately, we did not get to enjoy one of the most well known, Clingmans Dome. I hope someday we can take a vacation in this area to enjoy all that this area has to offer, like Clingmans Dome, river rafting, and the many others that are too numerous to list. I get to enjoy and get a unique perspective of America, that most people don't. How many awesome, historical, interesting places do we bypass in our cars rushing to get from point A to point B on the interstate? I enjoyed a local Italian place for lunch today. Their spaghetti was very good along with their garlic rolls, and the ice tea was absolutely the best I've had. The best part was that it was inexpensive. That is the disadvantage of a tourist town, most places are pricey. For a variety of reasons, we are taking two zeros. The biggest one is Tony was not feeling well and the weather. It will also probably be two weeks before we take anymore zeros. I hope to make up some time.

We got to Icewater Shelter and had lunch. The views from this Shelter were magnificent. We met Stairmaster and another thru hiker and a couple of day hikers hiking with their two year old and a baby.
We had gorgeous weather and got to see more magnificent views from Charlie’s Bunion. But that was not the end of the views. There were at least 5 other places with gorgeous views.
The only down side to today is that we had to buy Tony new shoes and about 5 miles from our destination, one of his big toes really started hurting him, so it slowed us down a lot and we did not get into camp until 6. The shelter was full and there were at least 10 or so tents. I did the usual camp chores, ate supper and then climbed in the tent in my sleeping bag because it was quickly getting cold.

We ended up putting our tent right next to the bear cables and two other tenters in a very unlevel piece of ground. I hiked part of the day with Nurp, another fellow nurse. We get into so late, I really don’t have time to talk to and get to know anyone but hopefully that will change. Nurp and Wet Sticks are the only hikers I know at this shelter.

I woke up at 6:15 and started packing. I didn’t even take time for breakfast. We were on the trail a little before 8. About an hour into the hike I stopped and at my blueberry pie quickly. 
We stopped for a short lunch break at Davenport Shelter and to get water. The lunch break was shorter than we had planned because a bee there freaked Tony out, which was actually a good thing because we ended up getting the last two bunks in the bunkhouse. 
A mile after Davenport Shelter we came to Davenport Gap, the exit for us out of the Smokies. The Smokies were beautiful but I was very happy to exit the park. The terrain after the Smokies was so much easier on the feet. There weren’t as many rocks or roots. It was also like we walked into Spring; everything was green and flowers were blooming. We passed a beautiful stream and waterfall about a mile from Standing Bear Farm.
When we got to the farm, Rhino greeted us and assigned us to the last two bunks and gave us a tour and a run down of the rules of the place. The first thing we did was get a frozen pepperoni pizza from him and cooked it. It was one of the best pizzas; probably because we were so hungry and it wasn’t trail food. We each had a coke too. Then I set up our sleeping area and got in line to take a shower. The shower is outside in this little enclosed building and the water was almost scalding hot but it felt so good. The bathroom was outside too and was a genuine outhouse. The also had two porter potties on the property, but they were full even though they had just been emptied 3 days before. That is how many hikers they have coming through right now. 
Wet sticks and Nurp were there and we met several other people: Spider, Space Bear, Blip and her daughter and daughters fiancé, 5-0, Song Bird, Meagan and her service dog, Jake, Matt, Daddy Shakira,... There were 75 people there (18 in the bunkhouse, 6 in the cabin, 1 in the treehouse and a few slept on the porches of the main house and the cabin and many others tented.)

It is awesome that we could ship stuff home from the hostel. I did not have to resupply as we have enough food to get us to Hot Springs.
It was either hike a 7.2 mile day or a 15.2 mile day and even though we are getting our trail legs, our feet and my knees have trouble with anything over 10, so we opted for the closer one.
We left around 10 and had a mostly up hill climb all day, but it was pretty gradual and again the terrain was very nice. We passed our first Bald which has some kind of government building on the top, but I did not investigate further as the wind was really blowing making it really cold. It rained some on us but was not too bad. We are sleeping in the shelter to avoid packing up wet tents.

The sun kept trying to peak out of the clouds, and I was praying for the sun to show when we got to Max Patch. Our prayers were answered and we enjoyed an hour at the summit and had lunch. We hiked on, passing Roaring Forks Shelter. About a mile from the shelter it started raining steady. I made the mistake of not putting on my rain pants and my pants ended up soaked. Tony was hiking way ahead of me and I came across this huge blow down that was blocking the trail. In fact when I came to the area, I had to use Guthook to help me find the trail. I was not sure when the trees fell and was very worried about Tony. I hiked the last 1.4 miles to Walnut Shelter as fast as I have ever hiked.
Thankfully I found Tony at the Shelter when I arrived. After talking to a few people, we figure the blow down occurred last night during the high winds. The first thing I did was change into my dry pants. Tony got us the last two places in the shelter. I set up our spots and then cooked macaroni and cheese for supper. It started raining hard again so we had to eat in the shelter.

Bloodhound was the first one up and then me around 7 and then Tony shortly after. Everyone was was excited to be going into Hot Springs to get a room somewhere to dry out, get some good food and a decent nights sleep.
I think Crisis was the first to leave, then Tony and me at around 8:30. The first part was a little up hill then down hill, then a long uphill. I caught up to Tony about a quarter of a mile from the top. He was taking a break. I shared one of my last Twix with him to give him the energy to finish getting up it. Then we had a long down hill. About half way into the hike Tony got really grumpy and mouthy which he later apologized for severe times after we got into town. He said it was because he was awake most of the night trying not to slide on top of Luna Tick and the rain.
We had quite the verbal fight going on for about 20 or so minutes when I learned it was better to just let him vent and keep my mouth shut. Just before Deer Creek Shelter and 3.2 miles from town Tony fell and re-scraped a knee he had scraped 3 days before. He was wearing his rain pants so it wasn’t as bad as it could have been. He said it was painful but he was able to keep hiking. About a mile from town we met Bloodhound’s wife, two daughters and mother waiting for them. I only spent a few moments talking to them as I was on a mission to get a room, shower and food in that order and to get of my feet. I could not believe how bad they hurt. The terry was nice so maybe it was because I tried hiking too fast.
We got into town around 3 and found rooms. We were sitting at Smoky Mountain Diner by 4:30 having supper. Tony had pizza and I had hamburger steak. Bloodhound and his family were eating there too. They are also zeroing tomorrow.

About 2 miles from the shelter we saw a black rat snake right on the trail. It moved along after a few minutes. We got to the shelter and met Double D from Canada.

I had another wonderful breakfast and Ann drove me back to Wilbur Dam Road and I was hiking by 9:45, much later than I should have started with the heat, but as I said it was really hard to get leave such a wonderfully comfortable and happy place and such good people. And it is Mother’s Day and not having Tony here is really hard, but the cards I got from Sam and my kids, along with the chocolate is what sustained me today when the terrain and heat started getting to me. I managed to pack the chocolate in a good place in my pack so they didn’t melt and I had some for lunch and supper with my meal. The terrain was really rocky and I had to watch where and how I stepped all day long to not roll or twist my ankle. I stopped at Vandeventer Shelter for lunch. I had a pop tart since they are my heaviest food. Then I had another pop tart for a snack. The heat was pretty intense. I arrived at Iron Mountain Shelter around 5 and set up my tent and then had supper and visua little with the other people staying at the shelter and then headed to my tent just to relax a little before going to bed. The following people were at the shelter:  Choo choo (a lady around 60), Foxy Ninja, Bear Claw, another guy that was hiking with Foxy Ninja and Bear Claw, Frieght Train, who I met as I started my hike today and hiked with a short while (he just retired from working in the train industry), Spitfire, Smiley ( an older lady from New Zealand), and a few others.","Wilbur DaM Road

In fact, I hiked a half a mile on a wheelchair accessible path, which ended with a bench facing a beautiful view. Before that was a barn with the AT symbol in it. I also hiked through a pasture that had cows before heading back into the woods. I managed to get a picture of a bumblebee on a flower. I saw more than 20 chipmunks. To top off this very interesting and beautiful day, about 4 miles before the shelter, at a road crossing was trail magic. I had 4 cups of sweet tea, a hotdog, baked beans and a pickle and a tangerine. Unfortunately I did not get our trail angels names. They do trail magic on Mother’s Day and then whatever is left they give away the next day which is often. I got to the shelter around 5 and decided to stay in the shelter so I could pack up quickly to get in town.

As i was eating, two men came by who said they were camping about a mile away, and they were just out for a leisurely stroll to Wilson’s Creek. I finished eating and resumed hiking. I saw some great views and passed what I believe are long horn cattle. In fact, I passed within feet of two of them. I reached the campsite, where two other guys were hanging out, friends of the two who had passed me earlier. The offered me some water and just before I continued hiking it started raining, so I quickly put on my rain gear. 
I walked through some more flooded areas and rocky terrain. When I came to Old Orchard Shelter, a father and son who were section hiking, were taking a break. I was going to stay at the shelter, but, instead, I decided to press on to Hurricane Shelter. However, I saw on Guthook, a nice little place to camp with ports potties that the people who bring horses to ride on the horse trails also stay. This campsite/horse trailer parking was at a road crossing. Oh, yes and the place has picnic tables. When I got there I cooked some Raman and then I set up my tent. I started talking to one of the couples who was at the campground for the weekend, but it started raining, so I headed to my tent and worked on my hiking strategy for the next few days. Which brings me to some exciting news, Tony is rejoining me on the trail this coming week.
The rain stopped, so I got out of the tent to stretch my legs. When the couple from earlier saw me, they invited me have dinner with them., Trail Magic!! These trail angels names are Joe and Vicky. I had a hamburger, chips, black eyed peas and potatoes. Vicky also said I could shower too, which I almost turned down but was glad I didn’t. The shower was so good.

When I went to bed last night, I was starting to feel sick too. My throat was hurting. I went to bed about 30 minutes earlier than normal and woke up an hour later than I had been. I took my time getting up and packing. The shelter did not have a water source. There was one 1.4 miles down the trail. So we waited to have breakfast at a campsite close to the water source. Cat Lover didn’t feel like eating though and i did either, but I forced myself to eat anyway. We resumed hiking, slowly, as neither of us had much energy. We were just looking forward to getting a hot meal from an Amish Store about 10 miles off the trail but provided shuttles to their store. When we got to the road crossing, 4 other hikers were there getting ready to call for a shuttle. But just as we ordered the shuttle two trail angels arrived, Ron and his wife. The Methodist church they attend provides a trash can just slight further north on the trail and they were there to pick up the trash and they said the would give us a ride. So we canceled the other shuttle. Ron took us to Mattie’s store instead of the one listed on Guthook, but I was ok with that because I just wanted a hot meal, but one of the other hikers needed a small resupply and the store was not very good for that. Cat Lover and I ordered some burgers and chips and soda. Cat Lover said he didn’t feel he could hike to the next shelter and I asked Mattie if she knew anybody who could take us to Bland. When I explained why she offered to give us two types of her essential oils to help with the colds we were fighting and she said Ron would probably take us when he came back to get the other hikers. Thankfully, Ron agreed to take us to the Big Walker Motel and we didn’t have to pay a fortune for a shuttle, although I did give Ron gas money. So, now here comes the part purists aren’t going to like, but I’m not going to spend a fortune for a shuttle to take us back to where we got off the trail today.

With not feeling great, it didn’t take much convincing. We waded in the water to cool off and I splashed water on my face and arms too to cool off. We played in the water for about an hour and watched other hikers jump from the Falls into the pool of water below. It was only maybe a 15 to 20 foot jump from the highest point.

This part of the trail is how I picture the Amazon being but without all the poisonous snakes and other dangerous creatures thank goodness. The temperature was nice too. The only problem was trying to find a place to take our first break because all the moisture makes everything damp and covered with moss. After about 3 hours we finally came to a campsite that had some stones stacked for sitting without moss. We took a short snack break here, then resumed hiking.
We came to a field and pasture area about half way into our hike and took another short break hear. When we resumed hiking, it wasn’t long until we came to a long area to the right of us taped off with the yellow police crime tape. Soon I came upon a tree with a paper attached to it regarding a pipeline being placed in this area. So I don’t know if the tape was to mark off the area and keep people out of the area where the pipeline is being placed or if an actual crime had been committed.

After McAfees Knob Stopped at Campbell’s Shelter to get water. Then Cat Lover hiked on without me. We had 6 more miles to go to Lambert Mountain Shelter. All was uneventful, untested Tinkers Cliff where I took a wrong turn and became totally lost for about 30 or so minutes. I fell I. A pile of brush and scratched my left leg up pretty good. I did finally find my way to the trail and just hoped Cat Lover had not made the same mistake I did. I arrived at the shelter around 7:45 and thankfully Cat Lover was there.

It made me start thinking with the money I’m spending we could enjoy a really good family vacation. I’m feeling a little selfish and missing the other half of my family.

We didn’t leave the lodge until 10:30 and had planned to hike only to Thunder Hill Shelter, but it did not have a good water source and it was very buggy. I almost forgot, we saw a rattlesnake stretched across the trail about an eighth of a mile from the shelter. It just layed there and we could not go around, so I stood a good distance back and threw some rocks toward it and it finally slithered off.
We did go under The Guilotine, a boulder that is hanging suspended between two big slabs of rock. 
We met Lorax and Truck at Thunder Hill Shelter. After seeing how bad the bugs were here, the plan was to press on to the first campsite, but Truck convinced us to go to Marble Springs Campsite.
