Cactus Dave_Desert Rose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588259,"So why are we attempting to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail?

When I was 16 years old I went on a one week backpack trip on the AT with two of my best friends, Rob and Tim.  Rob's parents dropped us off and we hiked north into Harpers Ferry West Virginia where they picked us up.  None of us had tents, and I was the only one that prepared for any rain by sewing up a slip-cover for my sleeping bag out of a large sheet of painters plastic.  Luckily for us we didn't see any rain on that trip!  I don't recall what our pack weights were, but I'm guessing 50+ pounds since we mostly took canned goods and other off the shelf items.  Aluminum canteen, aluminum mess kit, cotton sleeping bags, all the lightweight gear of the time.  I recall one night spent at a campground where we met a large youth group of girls backpacking in the opposite direction.  We spent the evening with them, and each of us fell in love with a girl we had only known for a few hours.  Oh to be a teenager again!
I had always enjoyed playing in the woods and hiking and camping with my parents and the Boy Scouts, but that trip was different.  What I came away from that trip with was the feeling of relaxation.  We didn't have all of the electronics we have today (GPS, computers, cell phones, 1000 channels on the TV), but the feeling of being away from the city (traffic, the hum of electric transformers, street lights, showers, flush toilets) for a full week was a transformative experience.  It's a feeling that I think only comes after about a week of getting away from it all.  I've always wanted to get back to the AT and hike that same section, or maybe the entire trail if I could swing it.
When Rose and I married we spent our honeymoon backpacking out to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.  We were totally unprepared for ruggedness of the trail (and carrying way too much weight!) and ended up cutting it short.  Throughout our working careers we've done a lot of camping and short backpack trips, but nothing longer than a few days.  But when I mentioned wanting to thru-hike the AT after retiring, Rose jumped on it.  She has done most of the planning and food preparation, and I doubt I would be attempting it without her.  But with her help I think we have a good chance at completing the almost 2200 mile trip.  We make a good team!  Even if we don't make it, I'm sure we're going to have a blast trying!",,View Entry,"Apr 28, Sat",0
Cactus Dave_Desert Rose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588654,"Before I get into the details of planning, I wanted to go on this trip because it is David’s dream to make an honest effort at completing an AT thru hike. And where David goes; I go.As many of you know David and gluten are not friends. That was going to make this trip more difficult, so I agreed to take on food planning. It started last November by scouring the internet for backpacking recipes that could be modified to be gluten-free. I would make several at a time to try out and if we liked it we worked to make the recipes GF and in portions that would satisfy a very hungry hiker. We probably tried 50 recipes to get 20 that we liked. Being mindful of caloric requirements, I created four different 5 day menus and figured if we rotated these menus six times we would have enough to complete about 2,200 miles of trail. The spreadsheets began.Next, how many ingredients do you need to make all those recipes?  We began seriously dehydrating ingredients in January. The dehydrator was turned off on April 12. Lots of other ingredients came from Amazon and Costco. Assembling 6 weeks of a recipe really speeded up the process.Assembling the boxes and vacuum sealing a days worth of food at a time took more time than I thought. Luckily a week ‘s worth of food fits in a large priority mail box. And where do you want these boxes sent?  David and I worked together to detail out the entire trail, figuring out where the post offices or mail drop locations are and what grocery store options we have to supplement our mailed boxes. Can you say more spreadsheets?  In the end I underestimated the number of weeks it would take us, so we had to throw 2 more boxes together last week. We finished the last box on 4/29.

Cactus Dave_Desert Rose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588688,"We flew from Phoenix to Charlottesville overnight and got picked up by a shuttler that brought us to Stanimals 328 hostel in Waynesboro.  
We’ve met a lot of hikers since we’ve been here - some section hikers and some thru hikers.  I think there’s about 12 people staying here tonight - they had 22 staying here a few days ago.  
We’re ahead of the bubble, so the thru hikers that are here either started early in February or have been hauling ass since they started.    Stories of walking thru waist deep snow make us glad we decided to do a flip-flop hike instead of the typical northbound.  When we hit the trail tomorrow we won’t be able to keep up with their 20+ miles per day pace.
Everyone’s been great!  “Wolf Clan” from New Hampshire pointed us to an all u can eat buffet within walking distance that was really good.  And “Happy Feet” was hitchhiking across town to an outfitter and offered to pick us up some fuel.  We rewarded her with a cold beer!

Day 1 of the trail is done. What a day. We started with a ride to the trailhead from the owner of the hostel we stayed at. Shoes hit the trail at 7:15. We made our planned stop at Calf Mountain Shelter, which is off the trail a bit. So we hiked an even 8 miles today. We reached camp at 2:30 and we had a leisurely afternoon to set up our hammocks, get water and make dinner. 
We really wanted to get to bed early so we could get up and hit the trail at by 6 am. Tomorrow is a 12.4 mile day and with rest breaks we hiked a remarkable 1 mile an hour today. At that pace we will take 12.5 hours to make camp. And we don’t have water available until we reach camp. 
Well it is 8:30 and the sun just set so bedtime for us. Don’t think camp was boring. There are 11 people camping here. At least 6 of them were at the hostel we stayed at last night. They all have strange trail names like Tarzan, Hungry Cat, Pee Wee, and Happy Feet. They all started in GA and are still in for the long haul. Everyone says it is not usual for this many people to be at the shelter. The weather is nice tonight so we are not using tarps. No rain in the forecast. We hope the stars give us a good show. Although I hope we both sleep like babies. We have a big day tomorrow

We saw a black snake on the trail today.  We’re not sure but we think it is a rat snake. It definitely was not a timber rattle snake. Some other people at our shelter did see a rattler on the trail though.
Our Hut was full tonight.  Not sure how many were camping - at least 15.
It was a long hot day. Temperature got up to 88 degrees and it was sunny. Normally the trees are so full of foliage that you would have a good bit of shade. But Spring has just arrived here in the Shenandoah National Park.  It is great for the views, but not so good for shade.

After such a big day yesterday, we made it a shorter day today - only 6.3 miles. We stopped short of our goal to camp at Loft Mountain campground.  There are many advantages to campgrounds over primitive huts or shelters. The nice thing about this campground is they have showers. Day 3 and I got a shower. My fingernails are clean once again.  They have running water you don’t have to filter.  Trash dumpster so don’t have to carry around 3 days of trash.  There is a camp store where we picked up some light resupply items but their computers were down so they had to add everything up manually, and we had to pay in cash with the exact amount.  
We expect rain on the trail tomorrow, so we will see how hiking in the rain goes.  There is light rain and strong winds right now as I type today’s report.  But I am warm, dry and comfortable laying in my hammock.

We made good miles again today. The hiking was easy due to the cloud cover.  At one point we stopped for water and a snack at a shelter and in 15 minutes time the fog rolled in. We ended the day the same way with fog creeping in while we were making dinner. We had to move under David’s tarp quickly to finish dinner. It wasn’t like being in the rain but the water particles accumulate on you quickly.
Met a family on the trail with a Phoenix connection, again.  Later in the day we met a small group of people on the trail with a SNP Ranger. They were on a wildflower hike. They told us the three petal flowers we were seeing are called Trillium and the high pitched birds we were hearing are oven birds. I have to say it is the serenade of the birds all day long and looking at all the different wildflowers that makes the day pass quickly. These aren’t your backyard birds and the dandelions even are prettier out here.Elevation gain: 3277Elevation loss:  2852~ Desert Rose","View east to Powell Gap Hollow

It’s official- the longest backpacking trip I’ve ever been on.
Wow, the trail was much easier today, with not as much elevation change, so we made great progress today. 
We started the day by passing the Lewis Campground. The plan was to get fresh brewed coffee at the camp store and use whatever amenities we could for free - water refill, restrooms with flush toilets and hot water, and trash service. I even washed my hair in the bathroom with hot water. Such luxury 
While there, we got a history lesson on the Campgrounds in SNP. This particular campground was built by the CCC and was a segregated campground just for the colored. 
For a late lunch/early dinner we made our way to the Big Meadow Wayside for a delicious meal. Waysides are little restaurants on the Skyline Drive that are situated near these campgrounds we have been passing. They usually have a camp store/gift shop associated with them. At the last campground the guy at the store said to get the fried chicken. It was the best you’ll get anywhere.  So I did and it lived up to it’s reputation.

Well we should be in Luray, VA tonight for some R & R but we cut short our third day and never made up the 3.5 miles. We are camping at trip Byrd’s Nest shelter which is exactly 3.5 miles from the trailhead to Luray.  So what that means is we will get up in the morning and hike an easy trail, mostly downhill to start our R & R.
The trail was hard today- lots of rocks to slow you down. But we kept at it and made over 12 miles. Along the way we saw two guys who work for USGS surveying salamanders. 
We passed the Skyland Resort. We went in for some snacks and a break. Very swanky place for a couple of people who smelled like us.
We also passed by a picnic area that was vacant so we took the liberty of washing up at the water spigot. That fool bath was just the thing to help me make the rest of the way to the shelter.
Can’t wait to have some down time tomorrow

Today we made it to Luray by about 10 a.m.  To get started we only had the 3.5 miles that was mostly downhill. Easy, right?  That was a torturous, rocky downhill. I was probably just wanting some comforts of home a little too much.
On the way down we passed under an overlook called Mary’s Rock. We didn’t go to the pinnacle but as we passed under it, we could hear Native Americans chanting up above.  It was very calming.
Down at the bottom is Thornton Gap Parking lot. Most everyone parking there looked like they were there to hike for the day. But I saw a pickup truck turn in and the man who got out didn’t look like he was there to hike. He looked like he was just there to use the facilities. So I asked him if he was going to Luray (9 miles West)   At first he said no, but then he said he was going there later in the day. Maybe he could rearrange his day and give us a lift. My second ‘yogi’ (getting a ride just for asking). Come to find out he is a Ridge Runner on the AT (SNP area). His job is to hike sections of the AT and assist hikers, as well as make sure people are following the rules. Lucky us.
So we arrive in town and he shows us some of the places we will need on Main St., then drops us off at the post office to retrieve Box #1.  Success, it was there. We decided to get a room at the Quality Inn, a 9 minute walk from the PO.  Too early to check in, so they stored our packs and off we go to get our errands done in the next 4 hours. Laundry, lunch, grocery shopping. 
The little town was cute; everyone was so nice. While walking to the hotel another man pulled over and asked if we were thru hiking and offered to take us shopping or back to the trail. He gave us a card with his phone number and told us to call anytime. We did take him up on the offer the next morning to get back to the trail. We offered him money but he wouldn’t take any. He said consider it his trail magic. See how nice people are in Luray.
Once we got the room after 2:00 we had showers and then more errands. We needed to mail a couple of packages, so back to the P.O.   Then we stopped in at the Outfitters store to purchase some new insoles for my shoes. 
Still more work that evening in the hotel room. So much stuff needed washed - water bottles, cookware, the clothes we wore while doing laundry, hiking pole handles.  Had to check in with family, so there’s phone time. I even got to FaceTime with Bennett. He knew who we were on the phone. I really enjoyed my time with him.  Ireally didn’t have time to do any posts.  Having a day off the trail is work.
We got a good nights sleep though.

Oh hail! - Two hail storms in one day.
The hotel had a nice little restaurant attached, so we got up early and had a good breakfast before trying to pack everything up. We still had all the food we had sent, plus all the food we bought, to divide up. Life on the trail seemed easier when we didn’t have 5-8 days of food to carry.
All packed and we call the man who offered to take us back to the trail.  Just as he pulled up it started to rain. It rained all the way to the trailhead.  As soon as we got our water bottles filled, the rain stopped. Nice!  We were considering just hiking to the first shelter and if it still looked like rain, we would stay there for the day. After all, yesterday wasn’t even like a relaxing day in town. 
At the shelter we met a young man who was doing some research work. He wasn’t from a university and I didn’t understand who was funding him, but he was a wealth of information on all sorts of birds, plants, insects, animals.  We also traded him information on long distance backpacking. He said his next project was to help build/plan a long distance hiking trail in Costa Rica.
The next interesting person we met was a woman out for a day hike and taking pictures of medicinal herbs. She teaches classes on the subject and also does consultations on your property.
Next interesting group was 6 Chinese backpackers. 
Well the weather looked fine so we decided to not take an easy day, so we hit the trail. About an hour and a half before reaching the Wayside we were hiking a ridge between two mountains. You could see both East and West. The thunder started and you could see the rain working it’s way up the side of the mountain. Then the hail started. It was all over in 15 minutes. In spite of putting our raincoats on, our pants and shoes were drenched.  We continued to hike through it all to get to the Wayside. It was going to be our dinner tonight and we were worried it would close before we got there. 
We made it in time and enjoyed the cheeseburgers and fries. We researched a stealth camping spot which was only a mile away. Upon getting up the hill to the camp spot we heard more thunder. We managed to get my tarp up before the skies opened up a second time today. We were in such a hurry we put my tarp up inside out. Oh well, it’s staying that way for tonight.

Today was exhausting for both of us. The assent elevation today was 2500 ft and decent was 1900.  The trail wasn’t even rocky today. However, the temperature and sun were factors to deal with. For whatever reason, we both felt tired all day. Hope we both sleep good tonight.
As for interesting people we met on trail today, we really only talked with one couple out for a day hike. For several miles, we kept trading places on the trail, when one of us would take a break. They were hiking with their dog that was being carried in a front pack. Lucky dog!  The woman is 5 months pregnant and going to have a girl. Her name is Shauna So of course I had to tell her about the Shauna in my life.
Since there wasn’t interesting people to tell you about, I will tell you about the wild turkey and the second black snake we saw. We surprised the wild turkey when we hiked up to a cabin close to where we camped last night. Rumor has it the cabin is locked but there is a privy. Well that was locked too. But I’m glad we hiked up there or else we would not have seen the turkey. The snake was at a shelter we stopped at for lunch. We ate our entire lunch and just as we were packing up to leave the snake came slithering out of the corner of the shelter. He had to have been there the whole time we were there. It looked just like the snake we saw on day 2

We finished up the 3 miles or so of SNP early in the day. I was wondering what the rest of the AT would look like once we left a National Park.  In some ways I like the trail better outside the park. I will miss the Waysides and crossing Skyline Drive several times a day. There were several occasions where you would come up on a campground, Waysides or overlook and could take advantage of the amenities.  But so far we have passed 2 shelters outside the park that are in better shape than the ones in the park.
Tonight we are hammocking at the Jim and Molly Denton shelter. We have been staying away from shelters because they can be very noisy. We prefer the stealth sites between shelters. We made an exception tonight because this shelter has a great reputation. There is a solar shower, picnic pavilion, horseshoes and chairs on the deck. Just had to see this place. Some interesting people are staying the night. There is a couple from Germany, a man from Canada and a family of six. This family lives a mile from where the AT crosses 522. The mother and the three youngest kids showed up first. In all there are four boys. They range in age from about 5 - 11. That mother hiked the kids about 6 miles up this mountain and none of the kids were complaining. The Dad and oldest son arrived later. Dad needed to fix the car. Anyhow it is Mother’s Day tomorrow so I guess this kind of free entertainment works for them.
The only other interesting thing that happened was when we stopped at  hostel in Front Royal. The name of the hostel is Mountain Cabbin (yes 2 b’s).  The hostel is located on a beautiful property right where the AT crosses 522. There is a B&B sign out there but that is not the building the hostel is in. It is in a little red brick building as you enter the property. We went in to see what kind of snacks they had for sale that we could use as resupply. The house was two story with four beds upstairs and four beds downstairs, a small but remodeled kitchen and one bathroom upstairs. We bought a pint of Ben & Jerry’s banana split ice cream and made it our lunch. Just as we were leaving, the owner came over to the hostel.  I asked him how he acquired the property. I thought it was probably in the family forever. He said he was doing a thru hike on the AT in 2012 and saw the house for sale. He put a bid in for it and completed the purchase six weeks after he completed the trail.  The house was not in good shape at all and they have been working to restore it for the last six years. They are finally close to opening the B&B part of the big house. The big house was built in the late 1800’s. The little red brick building was built earlier than that and housed the servants.

It is Mother’s Day and I am dedicating today’s trail miles to my mother, who passed away February 2. I know she was with me encouraging me through all the tough parts of the day.  Love you mom!
I am so glad we decided to use tarps last night. David wanted to string them up but not deploy them because he didn’t think it was going to rain. I said I’m not getting up in the middle of the night to deploy and stake out a tarp in the rain. Well it rained good-thunder and lightning. The rain continued through sun up so we didn’t get up all that early. When we did get up we took our time making breakfast. There was no hurry to pack up. 
Well we did finally get on the trail by 9:30. Before we hit the trail I used the privy. This privy rocked. First off it was clean. It had a farmers door so if it was stuffy in there you could open the top door. This privy even had a sky light and a mailbox full of toilet paper. Not cheap toilet paper; the good stuff. I know that was a lot about a privy but you can’t take things for granted while on the trail.
It is Sunday, Mother’s Day and we saw a lot of day hikers. The most unusual group was a dog obedience class out for a hike in the woods. We seem to be traveling in  a little bubble of people. Several of the people at last nights shelter is at this one tonight, Whiskey Hollow. This shelter is located on a creek. I don’t mean to scare anyone but as we crossed the creek on a bridge, we saw a timber rattler sunning himself on a log in the creek. That snake was in the same place an hour later. Someone else said they saw another kind of snake in the water.
Enough of snakes. Early in the day we saw two box turtles in the middle of the path. You don’t often see them in the wild.
Hiking was difficult today, because the rain caused high humidity. But we managed to make the miles we planned on. To end the day, fog rolled in the last 30 minutes of hiking. It is fun hiking in the fog, not to mention not as hot and humid

Rain, rain and more rain. It rained all night but stopped early enough in the morning that we were able to pack up and hit the trail by 8:30. At times we had fog to hike through, but most of the day was sunny. That means high humidity.  Still the hiking was pretty good.
We entered what they call ‘The Roller Coaster’ after lunch. It is 13.5 miles of up and down smaller hills. Up until now we have been climbing pretty big mountains- maybe 1,000 - 1,500 ft. ascents at a time.    And usually only 2 of those a day.  The Roller Coaster is like 200 - 300 ft. ascents and descents. They just come one after another.  Maybe 10 of them over the 13 miles. From what we saw today, we are going to have a hard day tomorrow. We only completed 2 of them today. 
About 30 minutes before the end of our day, the thunder started rolling in. Just as we got to our camp spot the skies opened up in a down pour. We got David’s tarp up and threw our packs under it with us. The rain didn’t let up for quite awhile. Once it slowed enough, we got my tarp up and we both were able to string up our hammocks. Tonight we chose to have a no-cook dinner of granola bars with PB&J, Spam and pecans. Anyhow we are both dry in our hammocks.
We smell like wet dogs; but at least we are dry.

Cactus Dave_Desert Rose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590596,"We were hiking along a ridge line about 3 miles into the “Roller Coaster” when the thunder started to pick up.  I checked the weather app and saw a storm was approaching with 50 mile an hour winds and pretty heavy rain. We needed to go about two more miles to get to a creek since we were running low on water, so we kept on hiking. As we came up to the creek the storm started to dump on us, so we quickly set up one tarp so we could sit under it and wait it out before we could set up a second tarp and our hammocks.  There was another gentleman at the site who was standing under a poncho in the pouring rain, leaning over his pack trying to find a tarp, swearing and cursing at himself because he couldn’t find it. We asked him to come over and sit under our tarp for a while to wait out the rain. His trail name was “K-bar”.  When the rain let up K-bar went off to set up his tent and Rose and I set up the other tarp and hammocks.  We were cold and soaking wet so we just decided to eat some cold snack bars for dinner and crawl into our hammocks.  At about 12:30 in the morning it started lightning and thunder and raining really heavy, and the next thing I know Rose is sitting under my tarp saying she’s afraid the creek that we’re camped along is going to rise and wash us out in a flash flood. All she could think about was an incident last year in Arizona where a family of 10 was swept away when a flash flood hit.  After about 30 minutes I asked her to go back and look at the creek and see how high it was, and she thought it was good enough to go back into her hammock.  Later that night I woke up from a sound sleep and felt something pushing against the side of me. Fearing a bear was coming at me I instinctively rolled over and away from it and fell right out of my hammock onto the ground!  It wasn’t a bear, it was Rose. She was back under my tarp worried that the creek was rising even further. After about 30 minutes of torrential rain I decided I’d go down and look at the creek to see just how high it was. It looked like it wasn’t going to come up to the hammocks so I yelled over to her to sleep in my hammock and I would sleep in her’s. This was all at 3:30 in the morning.  Amazingly we did get some sleep before we had to get up and do it all again.
I think the worst part, besides the wet clothes, wet muddy shoes and socks, and rocky, muddy trail, is putting on your same stinky clothes each morning.  Our last laundry was  6 days ago in Luray VA, and we smell ripe!  Rose describes it as smelling like vomit, but I think it’s more like a mix of spoiled milk, mold and mildew, with strong overtones of ammonia.  It really takes courage to put those cold, stinky, wet clothes on each morning!  
But tonight we hit Bears Den Hostel and were able to get showers and do some laundry, so we’re feeling fresh once again.  The forecast for the next few days is more of the same - sunny, humid days with heavy thunder/rainstorms in the evening.

We were in the Roller Coaster all day and didn’t even complete it. I thought we could but we could only go as far as The Bear’s Den Hostel. Frankly the Roller Coaster was as difficult as people have said. Actually, there are two camps on the subject. Either you hear it isn’t as bad as you think; or it is horrible and you want out of it as soon as possible.  What made it difficult for me was the wet ground and all the rocks. You wear yourself out planning your course through the slippery rocks and tree roots.
Because of the rain the previous night,  the trail was like a running creek. It didn’t matter if you were going up hill or going down hill, the water just ran and ran. Creeks were three times wider than normal which made it hard to cross.
I imagined I was in a video game, dodging one hazard after another.  Temperatures were in the high 80s, so up hill was slow going. 
I think I have earned some scout badges:

Entire body glistening with sweat badge
Wet shoes all day badge
Pooping in the woods badge
No ticks yet badge
No poison ivy yet badge 

I know some of you are jealous and probably want these badges for yourself. Let me know and I will get you some directions.
Checking into the Bear’s Den Hostel was just the ticket for me. I definitely needed some pampering.

Cactus Dave_Desert Rose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590963,"AT - 5/16 Day 15. Trees blown down like matchsticks 
 Time flies on the trail. It’s funny how you can be dead tired each night, but in the morning you get up and your feet don’t hurt anymore, so you hit the trail again for 9 or 10 hours. Before you know it 2 weeks have passed and you are beginning the 3rd week of the trail.
We headed out with some foggy skies but it didn’t rain all that much last night.  The temperature is much cooler today and is a welcomed relief. Hiking was good for the most part, early in the day. We stopped to eat lunch and met a couple of young men by the trail names of Irish and Beach Bum. They were very nice young men. They are taking a year off between high school and college to hike the trail. They did start in GA and have made it this far, so I give them a lot of credit. Irish was carrying a recorder and played us a tune - Rocky Road to Dublin. You just don’t find people willing to entertain you like that unless you’re out on the trail.  Irish is from MA but he has plans to attend the University of AZ in the fall. Another AZ connection for you.
The day was growing long and some light rain began to fall. This section of the trail isn’t known for many water sources (except for the water running on the trail). We were stopping for the night at the next shelter but the water report said the spring was a quarter of a mile down a steep hill. Get water before the shelter if you can. We stopped about 3 miles before the shelter to get water at the Blackburn Center. Well this place was a quarter of a mile off trail and downhill too. At least it was switchbacks to get you down and back up. The time spent off the trail put us a bit behind schedule. We proceeded to the shelter wearing raincoats for the first time we set foot on the trail.
About a mile before the shelter we began seeing some real devastation from the storm the night before. David has posted some of those photos. Trees were toppled over like matchsticks.  The soil was saturated everywhere.  There was green leaf blow down from what I now know was hail. Green leaves everywhere on the ground.
We arrive at the shelter and our good friend K Bar was there. Two other people were there already too. The shelter holds 6, but David was determined to sleep in his hammock even though the ground everywhere was saturated and there were creeks running where there really weren’t creeks.  The rain was coming steadily. I decided I was safer staying in the shelter with people I didn’t even know. David set up his hammock far enough away I couldn’t even see him. I went down there later to give him his dinner and he was still struggling with his set up. He is a determined person. Anyhow my sleep in the shelter wasn’t so bad. The next day, David said he heard a big tree fall near him. The exact reason I didn’t want to sleep outside of the shelter.
Rain fell pretty hard all night long.  If we thought there was a lot of water on the ground today, wait for tomorrow.

Cactus Dave_Desert Rose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590966,"AT - 5/17 Day 16 Heading to Harpers Ferry on liquid trails
The hike into Harpers Ferry should have been an easy hike. There wasn’t much elevation change and we were told the trail pass the Roller Coaster had fewer rocks. Well I sure hiked over a lot of rocks. I’m beginning to see a pattern develop.  Well you probably already know from David’s posts, the entire trail turned liquid. We only had 8 or 9 miles of level trail, so we made it into Harpers Ferry about 1:00. That is early for us. I have to admit when it became impossible to avoid the water it was fun hiking in ankle deep water. I felt like it was a way to rinse the bad smell out of my shoes.
I have to say I felt exhilarated to come hiking out of the forest onto the bridge that crosses the Shenandoah River. Watching people driving their vehicles while I have been carrying my backpack for 150 miles, made me smile.
First stop was the Appalachian Trail Conservancy to fully register our through hike and to have our picture taken for the year book. Oh my, that was a terrible picture as we were fresh off the trail and pretty much soaking wet.  We quickly learned the news that they were shutting down a portion of the trail. There is a foot bridge and train track that crosses the Potomac River and crosses over into MD.  It was the railroad that was calling the shots on the closure. It was expected that the Potomac was going to rise to 20 feet and that would make train travel unsafe.
Second, we settled into the Tea Horse hostel.  Just 2 doors down was a little restaurant called the Anvil. We got a meal there and had a few beers. They were so good.
The Hostel filled up tonight and we had lots of people trying to decide what to do about the closure. Conversations went on late into the night. Fortunately we were planning on taking a Zero day and just exploring this historic town tomorrow.

We got up early and went down the street to the historic part of Harpers Ferry. This place is so neat. Lots of displays of Civil War history, Lewis and Clark and history of channels and locks where the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers meet.  We even walked through a cemetery here.  I know Mom would have liked that.
Later in the day we had to get busy with our shopping for resupply and figure out what we were going to do to get out of here.  We found out the hostel is full tomorrow night so we decided to get a ride to the point where the trail is open in Maryland. It is only about 5 miles away. We made arrangements with 2 men who are at the hostel and are doing section hiking. They both have cars and have agreed to shuttle us to where we can get back on the trail. The forecast is for rain, but the rain has been light, so we are taking our chances it won’t be a big issue for us tomorrow.

Back on the trail again today. We got a ride from a couple of gentlemen, who were staying at the hostel with us, to the Weverton Cliffs trailhead on the MD side. In all, that bypassed about 4 miles of trail. The MD side was not closed but the ATC has been reporting MD has issues on the trail and hikers should remain off the trail. We couldn’t stay at the hostel, so we decided to move on, according to our schedule. 
The hike started out raining as usual. It was a soft rain but would soak through unless you protect yourself. So for the first time, we decided to wear both our rain coats and rain pants. We were determined to try to stay dry today.  Even the trail started out nice.  Eventually, the rain coat came off but the rain pants remained on for the day. That was to help keep the mud splatter off our pants.  Yes, the trail turned so muddy it was hard to decide which side of the trail was better to walk on, so we spent the day crossing from one side to the other.  I have to wonder how many additional miles we racked up crossing the trail all day. Since this is about day 4 of continuous rain the puddles are thick with brown liquid. You can’t see the ground and many times there isn’t a way to ride the high side of the trail. You just have to walk through the puddle and hope for the best. Hence the name of today’s post - Mudders.
We stopped at the first shelter we came to, the about 2 miles into the day. There were 2 young girls that just started their flip flop hike the day before. They didn’t know each other when they started but I think they will try to stick close together. They don’t have trail names yet. They both arrived separately but ate lunch at the same park we ate at, Garthland State Park. At the end of the day they both showed up separately at the shelter we stayed at, Rocky Run Shelter.
The trail wasn’t terribly busy for a weekend day. The weather just kept people away. The only people you saw were backpacking.  In the afternoon a group of about 8 kids went by and a little later on another 10. They said they were hiking with their high school for credit. I sure would have been worried if I was the teacher in charge if anything bad happened during that storm. They were hiking the entire MD portion of the trail from PA south to Harpers Ferry, about 40 miles. We also saw some Boy Scouts out on an overnight trip.
We arrived at Rocky Run Shelter and were surprised that no one was there. David agreed to try sleeping in the shelter with me and use the limited equipment we have for sleeping pads, etc. We are set up for hanging our hammocks but when we get down to the Smokies we may have to sleep in a shelter and he wanted to see how it would be. 
Not long after we got set up a group called the NOBO Horde (north bound horde) started showing up. We heard about this group of kids from our friends we met the other week, Irish and Beach Bum. These kids have been together since GA all through the snow and nasty weather this spring. I recognized some of the names so I had to ask if they were the Horde. Yes they were. Anyhow, we thought we would have the shelter to ourselves but in the end we had about 12 people in our shelter, 4 more in hammocks in the campground and another 4 in a second old shelter.  
It was kind of interesting listening to the members of the Hoard get to know the 2 new girls as they sat around talking at the picnic table as I drifted to sleep.

Rocky Run Shelter to Pogo Memorial Campsite 11 Miles 
How nice to wake up without the sound of rain. Our shoes and socks were still wet from the day before. We washed the mud out in the creek the night before. Wet shoes have become the new normal. We set out knowing we probably wouldn’t see rain today. No rain coat or rain pants needed. The sun made it a bit humid but I think the temperature only got to about 80 today. 
By 10 am we reached The Washington Monument State Park. There is actually the original Washington Monument there. Lots of displays of Revolutionary times all about the park. There was even a group of people practicing for a Civil War re-enactment. While eating our snack, they fired the cannon. What a startle that was. It is so neat walking through all these historic places.  
The rest of the afternoon hiking was pretty good. It is Sunday and with the sun out there were lots of day hikers on the trail. We hiked along with a mother and her son for awhile. They showed us these flowers called Pink Lady Slipper Orchids. They said they were rare because they only grow where there is a certain fungus. These flowers are becoming extinct because the fungus is not as prevalent as it used to be. That agrees with what a young man told us about some orchids growing in Shenandoah. Anyhow there are a lot of people on the trails in the past couple of weeks due to these flowers being in bloom. They don’t look great now due to the rain. In fact we have noticed a lot fewer wildflowers and birds singing throughout the day because of the rain. But today the birds were back.
We hear no rain for Monday but the possibility returns for Tuesday. I’ll take it one day at a time.

We are starting to run into more and more flip flippers that started in Harpers Ferry. The other day I told you about 2 young girls that started separately but now seem to be hiking together. Last night we met a man that just started in HF.  His trail name is Kibs. He just retired 20 days ago and figured it would be a good time to try this. He is a left arm amputee with a prosthetic that isn’t liking the rain and humidity. He needs to go into town and borrow an Allen wrench and some lube to fix it. David has been teaching him how to use the GPS app we use to tell us where we are on the trail and how far all the next waypoints are. It is called Gut Hook. Kibs is very thankful to have David around.
This morning we met a woman by the name Nic (Nicole) who just started in HF.  Last night she camped with the other 2 girls, Gwen and Sariah.  We got her to come up with a trail name so she chose “22”.  That is the number of veterans who commit suicide every day. Come to find out she is a Veteran who has PTSD and recently lost her boyfriend to suicide. It seems everyone out here has some serious story as to what they are here. 22 is camped where we are tonight. She also hammocks but she has an Eno hammock and isn’t very proficient in setting it up, so David and I helped her figure it out.
We met one more flip flipper that started in HF. His trail name is Tuck.  He just got out of the Service about 8 days ago. I can’t believe how little time some people take to get ready for a trip like the. We planned for a year and a half.
A place of interest was the Pen-Mar State Park. It is on the MD side of the border. In my opinion it should be called Mar-Pen Park. Anyhow we were talking with the caretaker of the park and he told us it was an amusement park back in the early 1900s. People from all over the world would come there. It had a big bandstand and big bands and orchestras would hold concerts there. It didn’t survive the depression. I think it would be interesting to see pictures of it back in those days. In the 1970s they got the park all fixed up again and still have bands play at the bandstand. It was a very nice park. The caretaker said Camp David and the underground Pentagon is near that park.

Cactus Dave_Desert Rose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591607,"AT - 5/22 Day 21 Milestones 
I really don’t have much to say about today. We passed some milestones though:

Completed Maryland. People say MD is easy. Only 40 miles and mostly flat. That is true but they do have hills to climb. Our ascent and descent for a 12 mile section looks just like when we were in Shenandoah. And the ups and downs were boulders you had to navigate. Not easy like you would think.
Entered Pennsylvania. We completed about 8 miles so far. I say PA is better than MD right now. I know the PA rocks are still ahead. Someone told us the last 60 miles and we have over 200 miles in PA alone. We’ll see how tomorrow goes 
205 miles hiked. That is something, in my opinion. Considering the longest backpacking trip we took before this was 53 miles on the AZ Highline trail. Every morning we get up and our feet don’t hurt like the night before. We don’t have any strained muscles. We just figure we can walk another 12-13 miles and do it. You don’t feel a cumulative tiredness and you only need to think about the trail you are on right now.

As for traveling partners, we seem to have lost most of them. We are at the Tumbling Run Shelters tonight and only 1 person for last nights shelter is here. I don’t even know his trail name. We do have a group of Outward Bound kids staying at the group sight here. They were out climbing today. There is only about 30 minutes before dark. I think they will quiet down quickly. We are camped by a creek and it will be a pleasure to fall asleep to the sound of the creek.

Just as we were about to leave the trail we heard someone calling us. It was 22 and Tuck. They are staying at the same hostel as us tonight. We were worried they got lost on the trail, as there were several times the trail took an unexpected turn. We are glad the new hikers are safe.

Okay, surely the name of the post got your attention. We crossed this road earlier today and what was spooky about it was where it was located. Two years ago they did a prescribed burn in this part of the forest and they are still working on restoring the area. David has probably already posted pictures of the still standing burned trees. Some of the trees actually have green leaves growing out of the tops. Just this last March they sprayed the area with an herbicide. Anyhow that is the most curious thing we saw today.
Let’s talk about the Trail of Hope Hostel last night. I don’t think the house had air conditioning or fans for that matter. Everyone had their windows opened, which was fine. What wasn’t fine was the road work that was going on right outside the hostel. It was located directly on State Route 30. They were resurfacing the road. After we were all in bed, sometime around 10 pm, heavy equipment was right outside the hostel grinding down a high spot in the road before they sealed over it. It made so much noise the house shook. David thinks it went on for an hour or two. They did move up the road, so in all, I guess it could have lasted that long. Somehow we got enough sleep to move on today.
Let’s talk about today. First, you should know we put in our longest day-16.1 Miles.  It’s hard to say why today was better than other days. The terrain was very good today. What Southern PA has are long ridges to hike. It takes some effort to get up there; but once you do you have some long flat ridges to walk. We had over 2,000 ft. ascent and descent today. Another thing we are trying to work on is our stamina. Ever since we left Harpers Ferry we have been reaching our destination by early afternoon. We want to be able to utilize some of those late afternoon hours and get more miles, but we have been too exhausted. So today we tried something different. We made good miles before lunch. Instead of eating our usual lunch, we made more of a dinner. We heated water and had a hot meal. I even had a cup of Lady Gray tea (caffeine was needed). While we ate lunch we were able to soak our feet in the creek. Before taking off we both took some ibuprofen, just to help keep inflammation down. Now here is what may have helped the most. Both of us listened to music for our entire afternoon segment. The time and miles passed quickly. I know we are supposed to be communing with nature and putting the technology away; but sometimes you have to do what works. Again, the trail really lent itself to longer hours of travel than other days.
We have to get up extra early tomorrow to make it to the hostel we had a box sent to. They are closed between the hours of 9 am. and 5pm.  We have 3.7 miles to hike to get there and we don’t want to miss our opportunity by getting there after 9 am.  David has the alarm set for 5 am.  Good night.

Today started off, as I said last night, early. We were worried that if we showed up to pick up our box after 9 am. we would not find anyone there. So we were up and on the trail by 6:00 this morning. We didn’t have any coffee or tea because we figured we could have breakfast at the Pine Grove Furnace General  Store. The AT Guide book says they have a grill and hiker foods. The store is right next to the Iron Masters Mansion Hostel where our package was. Well the hostel was very nice. We got there about 8:00.  It really was a mansion owned by the family that ran the Iron smelting furnace that the community is named after.
After picking up the box, we headed next door to the general store. On the steps down from the porch, David pulled a muscle in his calf. Nothing serious but it did slow us down. We only accomplished 11 miles today.  We got to camp about 2:30 which is early but that is all we wanted to try today.
Back at the Pine Grove Furnace State Park is an Appalachian Trail Museum.  We went in there. Pretty neat historical information there. We never did get to eat breakfast there. The AT Guide Book said they were open at 8:00 but the sign on the door said 11:00. So we helped ourselves to some things in the hiker box and moved on.
We are only planning a 10 mile day tomorrow to make sure David’s calf heals up.

The word for today was HOT. I think David said it hit 90 degrees. It is Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. Summer is just around the corner. The weather has been dry lately. Thunderstorms in the forecast; but no storms have developed. I wouldn’t want to ruin people’s holiday weekend by hoping for rain. For the most part the trail is under the cover of a tree canopy; so, at least we don’t have to deal with direct sunlight. The uphill climbs are pretty sweaty. It’s good to sweat all the toxins out.
We started the day with a short walk (1.5 miles) to the Green Mountain General Store and deli with hopes of getting breakfast. They did not disappoint. They were open and serving breakfast. I ate something I never order- biscuits and sausage gravy with fried potatoes. It just sounded like it would stick with me for awhile. And it did get me through the day with only snacks, until we stopped for the day at 3:00. The bad thing about it was it was hard to digest that much when you are starting out on a strenuous trail. My digestive system didn’t like that very much. 
Hiking was hard today. We came to a big rock maze. It was climbing some pretty big boulders. David has pictures posted. We lost trail several times trying to get through it. The arrows on the rocks were not all that visible. 
We stopped a bit early on the trail today and plan to go into Boiling Springs tomorrow to get the grocery resupply for the box we just picked up yesterday. There is a hostel there that we sort of have arrangements with. With it being a holiday weekend we didn’t think getting a hotel room anywhere would be easy. The town of Boiling Springs is very small with just a few places to stay or eat. The good thing is it is only 4 miles away, so a short hike there. We can relax in town, get some food and do our shopping before we get a ride out to the hostel.
Tonight we are camped at a stealth campsite next to a creek near the Alex Kennedy Shelter. There isn’t another shelter for 18.2 miles, unless you count the backpackers campsite in Boiling Springs. It is located right next to the train tracks. That is why we are taking our chances at the hostel. We will let you know how it all turns out.
It’s a good thing we stopped early today. We had enough time to eat and get everything cleaned up before the rain. It came down hard but we are safe and dry in our hammocks.

It’s funny how quickly things can change when you’re on the trail. I have been uncertain about what to do about getting grocery store resupply during this holiday weekend. The plan was going to be to go into Boiling Springs, have lunch, get grocery items, then stay at a hostel. There were some flaws with this plan that I won’t go into. 
On our way to Boiling Springs, we passed a group of brothers with their sons hiking south. I stopped to talk to the boys and sooner or later we got around to asking about where they stayed the night before. They said the backpackers campsite next to the railroad track. So we decided to check that campsite out as we approached Boiling Springs. When we arrived at the campsite we saw a lady and her son that we saw a couple of days ago. They are from Oklahoma. The lady looks to be in her early 30s, the son about 13.  We discussed a wide range of topics; then asked where they were headed tonight. She indicated they were hiking about 8 miles to Carlisle PA. I told her to check if Days Inn had rooms available on this Memorial Day weekend. Supposedly, this area has car shows every other weekend and hotels fill up fast. She called and they said they had plenty of rooms.  
In my initial planning I wanted us to end up in Carlisle; but built in the Boiling Springs option because of the holiday. Well we quickly decided to finish hiking the day to Carlisle and took a room at the Days Inn.
The part of the trail we were on today is called The Cumberland Valley. It is about 15 miles long and is flat, level land as a very narrow corridor through farmland. It was nice to have a change of scenery. We hiked through a pasture and past a family plot cemetery with dates in the 1800s. We even crossed the Pennsylvania Turnpike.
We are planning a zero day tomorrow to go to the grocery and rest up a bit.

At home, we shop at Walmart about twice a year, unless we are on vacation. Then we have been known to shop at Walmart as many times as 3 times in one day.  We are beginning to feel more comfortable shopping at Walmart because the inventory is pretty consistent for what we need.
Not only were we able to pick up our grocery resupply list in its entirety; but I also got a much needed haircut. With the high heat and humidity, I have been at odds with wearing what feels like a knit hat all day. I felt suffocated. Anyhow, thank goodness Walmart has a beauty salon within the store.  It was even open on a national holiday (for good reasons or bad reasons).
At breakfast this morning we saw the mother and her son. They came in late last night. I asked if they needed anything at Walmart and they said yes. We ended up sharing an Uber ride with them that made the trip more economical.  That was our first Uber; probably not our last.

Back on the trail today. Left Days Inn in Carlisle after eating a wonderful breakfast at the Middlesex Diner. That is the third time in as many days we ate there. We loaded up on liquids as this next section of trail doesn’t have very good options for getting water. The very thought of loading up on liquids makes me want to pee. And pee is what I needed to do once we hit the trail, several times over. One time I didn’t stick my hiking pole in the ground good enough and it fell over into some poison ivy. I was careful not to carry it by the handles or straps. We were hiking along a creek and when the opportunity came I was going to wash it off in the creek. This section of trail was mostly a clay soil. When it gets wet it’s like walking on snot. Well I almost slid right into the creek. This wasn’t a regular creek; it was the size of a river. The good news is I only came close. I washed off my hiking stick and never got poison ivy. I told you, it could have been worse.
We made it 13.6 miles today. Even though the temperature was in the mid 80s. The humidity was 90% this morning. The last 3.7 miles were the hardest. The first mile of that was 760 feet of ascent, only to have the last 2.7 miles be very rocky. Not sure if these are the PA rocks that everyone talks about. We had a good friend, K Bar, just leave the trail right after this section because of his feet. I hope we get through the PA rocks and still want to be on the trail.
When we finally got to the shelter, Nic 22 was there. It is fun running into people you  haven’t seen for a couple of days.  This shelter is Cove Mountain Shelter. The shelter itself has been porcupine proofed.  The steps were removed and there was sheet metal attached to any surface they could possibly climb up.

We left the shelter at our usual time, about 8:00. We just can’t seem to get everything packed up much earlier than that. It was a 4 mile hike mostly downhill to Duncannon. The humidity was 98% this morning. I was glad to be going downhill. But again, lots of rocks and lots of rock steps. The mosquitoes were bad too. Today was the first day we both had to stop and put bug lotion on. Normally David isn’t bothered by mosquitoes but today he was.
We were going to meet some of the people from the shelter at The Doyle Hotel for a beer, but we got there a little after 10:00 and it doesn’t open until 11:00. The Doyle is an iconic AT place to stop. The hotel is pretty run down, we hear; but the beer is cold. Well, we passed on the whole thing. The town is big enough to have 6 churches on one street. We had to walk through the whole town to get to the next mountain, Peter’s Mountain.
We knew we had a 1000 ft climb right away. The climb wasn’t all that bad. They used switchbacks and the rocks we had on the last mountain were not on this one. However, when we got to the top we had to maneuver over and around big boulders for 3/4 of a mile all along the ridge line. Such a workout while wearing a backpack of about 35 pounds.
We ended up stealth camping about 3 miles short of the next shelter. In the late afternoon, we hit some rocky trail again that slowed us down and wore us out.
Possible rain tonight. Radar showed thunderstorms south of us in the VA area. I would prefer a nice gentle rain if it has to rain at all.

Who would have thought we would make it 30 days out here. I’m sure the success has everything to do with the fact we have each other. Still there is room to miss everyone else. I would like to go to Isabelle and Mia’s graduation, I really want to see Pax Verum, wish I could spend some time with Linda and Sue. Then there’s the immediate family in Arizona. I miss them all very much. 
The hiking was good today - 11.7 miles. We had to stop short of our original destination due to rain. David tells me we are at 298.8 total miles. If we had continued to the planned campsite, we would have hit our 300 mile mark. 
We finished the last mountain and moved on to another. The last mountain had an astonishing 14 mile ridge line. I think this mountain has about the same. It has just been in PA that they get you up on a ridge line and have you ride it the whole way. 
We stopped for lunch late in the day, about 3:00. There wasn’t much water on that last mountain and we were saving what we had to drink instead of using it to make lunch. Anyhow when we finally got water after about 9 miles we did take a leisurely lunch. There were some campsites at that spring and I thought to myself we could just end the day here. But finishing out another 3.7 miles would ensure we are able to make it to Pine Grove for a hotel stay. I am looking forward to the conveniences of a shower and clean laundry. We decided to go for it. As we headed out, I said goodbye to a man we just met from Clayton OH. I got to thinking about the old neighborhood and started to feel a pep in my step. Heck yeah, let’s do these miles. Then a name popped in my head - Terri’s mom, Darlene. I thought, “Is that you Darlene, giving me the push I need ?”  I got the feeling she answered me back with a yes. I am so glad I have had so many people in my life that wants me to complete this trip.

Cactus Dave_Desert Rose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592794,"AT - 6/1 Day 31. Caffeine Can Make Your Day 
It was raining last night when we set up and it rained all night until dawn. It made getting up and packed an undesired activity. It took us until 9:00 to get on the trail. I really hate packing up wet stuff. Our clothes from last night were still damp; but we had to put them on anyhow. The hammock stuff was not wet but everything is still damp feeling. Anyhow we skipped making coffee or tea. A big mistake. 
The day was dragging. It seemed like the time would not pass and every time we looked at the app, we hadn’t made any mileage. We found a really nice campsite to take a break and decided right then we needed caffeine. We made ourselves a double Carnation Instant Breakfast (chocolate) and put 2 Instant coffees in it. That was lunch and we made it all the way to the next shelter without any breaks. We really wanted to go further today but needed to do some light housekeeping. We ended up with nearly a 10 mile day, so not too bad for starting late and ending early. 
We are camped at the Rausch Gap Shelter. The spring is easily assessable right in front of the shelter. Some of the recent shelters had the spring .2 or .3 of a mile down a steep hill. The last one said 300 rock steps down. For those places we try to get our water before the shelter. Then we usually end up carrying more water than we need for miles. So hard to plan. 
I think we got here about 3:00 today. We had time to set up and get our tarps and bedding dried out. I don’t think there is rain in the forecast for tonight but we don’t have Internet service here to really check. Let’s just say the air feels much drier.   It has been 4 days since we have done laundry, so our clothes are starting to smell sour. We made a washing ziplock bag and washed our shirts. We even had a private section of the campsites so we took mini showers. It’s amazing how tolerable the wilderness can be when you are clean. Early to bed for us with hopes of getting up early on the trail. Maybe we can make up some of those lost miles. Tomorrow will start with some caffeine. I would still like to stay in a hotel in Pine Grove. If not tomorrow then we should get there early on Sunday. 
Just before we got to the shelter we saw the biggest displays of pink lady slippers we have seen thus far.

The name of today’s mountain was not really Poison Ivy Mountain; but it should be. I hope neither one of us break out from it. 
We finished today with 15.5 miles. We did make it to a hotel in Pine Grove. The hotel used to be an Econo Lodge but they have chosen to go independent . Now they are Seasons Inn. There are only 3 hotels here. One was sold out and the other was twice the price. It has what we need and it is a big step above staying at a shelter. 
Even after hiking 15 miles we managed to get laundry done and light resupply at Dollar General, next door. The hiking today was a mixed bag. Elevation change was a bit brutal; 2,300 up and 2,000 down. Add to that there wasn’t water for 13 miles. We crossed several roads and highways today. Also had to cross a large section of rocks. Just when you don’t think you have the energy to do it, they throw rocks at you. 
Anyhow we made the miles and now need sleep

Cactus Dave_Desert Rose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593275,"AT - 6/3 Day 33. “Fun Facts”
For several days now we have been hiking along and seeing a small group of people at the shelter. One of the girls in this group has a trail name of Fun Facts. One day I asked her if she had a fun fact for the day. She came back with, “The wintergreen is beginning to put on new growth and becoming visible.”  I asked if it looks like other mints and she said no. She couldn’t find any where we were to show us what it looked like; but she said it usually grows under the mountain laurel. We would know the smell if we found it. 
Today David discovered the wintergreen. While we were in town he looked it up on the internet and found out it is a ground cover that doesn’t die back in the winter. The leaves are thicker and waxy so it can make it through the winter; hence wintergreen. The leaves look a lot like the mountain laurel but a little smaller. David spent a little time picking some leaves to make tea with tonight. 
We didn’t end up making the tea. Instead we had hot chocolate with bean and cheese burritos. We actually had dinner at lunch time. While we were cleaning up it started to sprinkle rain. We wanted to just set up camp early if it was going to rain. However we couldn’t find trees suitable for hammocks, so we hiked on a couple more miles. Besides, the rain stopped.  We did get set up just in time for the real rain. 
Here is a first...since we already had dinner and it was raining, David came over to my hammock and we laid there together for awhile listening to the rain. I was surprised we both fit. It was pretty comfortable, too. We decided we wanted to take the chill off from the rain so we heated water for the hot chocolate and beans. What did you have for dinner?  By the way, it continues to rain and will probably rain all night again. 
We will have to try the tea another time. I hope we run into Fun Facts again soon. I want to tell her we discovered the wintergreen. Maybe she will have another fun fact for us.

Cactus Dave_Desert Rose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593276,"AT - 6/4 Day 34. Go With The Flow
Yesterday when we were about to leave the hotel it was drizzling rain. If I was at home contemplating a hike, I would have called it off. But we didn’t want to stay another night at the Econo Lodge. So we packed up and headed out. By the time we were packed, the rain had stopped. And it ended up being one of the best days for hiking. The temperature was in the high 60s with a light breeze to keep the bugs away. 
It did rain last night up until midnight, so the tarps were wet to pack up. Today’s weather was just as nice. Cool temperatures. Sometimes so cool that when we stopped for a break we wanted to put a jacket on. I think David said it got down in the 40s last night. It felt good to pull the sleeping bag up. 
That’s the thing about long distance hiking. You don’t get to pick and choose the best days for hiking. You just go with the flow and hope it all works out. 
Taking another break Tom. We have about 5 miles to hike to get to Port Clinton. We have a box waiting for us at the post office. We will take a zero day with it to get our grocery resupply done. David chipped a tooth and wants to see if he can get into a dentist. We need a little extra rest for our feet. We think the hard PA rocks are coming up as soon as we get back on the trail. 
We did have our wintergreen tea tonight. Pretty good stuff.

Cactus Dave_Desert Rose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593277,"AT - 6/5 Day 35. Fair Warning - Snakes Ahead
Today we head to Port Clinton, where we will stay in Hamburg, PA for a couple of nights. We have a box to pick up at the Port Clinton post office. The PO is only open from 12:30 - 4:30 so there is no hurry to get there. We only have about 5.5 miles to go to get there. 
We slept in a bit but hit the trail by 9:00. So nice to sleep in. David and I had a conversation this morning about how he says he does not need to look down at the trail as he hikes so he sees more wildlife and camping spots than I do. He says he acquired that skill from riding motorcycles. Whatever!  Well yesterday he did get to see some wildlife before me; but that was because he was in front of me. We were in an area of some pretty tall ferns...so pretty to look at. Up leaps a fawn, whose name has to be Bambi. He leaped up to hill to the protection of his mother. The color was that deep reddish-brown with those beautiful white spots and the whitest tail. It all happened so fast, he didn’t have time to pull out the camera. If you want to see this, you will just have to join us on the trail. 
Today, I had my opportunity to see wildlife before David and I wasn’t ahead of him. He just plain missed it. David was walking ahead and busy gathering wintergreen. He was about 30 yards ahead of me when I let out a scream and did the Mexican Hat Dance on the trail. I heard something that was not natural; but I couldn’t put my finger on it. As I looked down at the trail, it was like the trail was moving. It hit me, the sound I heard was the rattle of a timber rattlesnake. The moving ground was the snake slithering by my hiking pole. My scream startled David who turned as quickly as he could, with a 30 pound backpack on, expecting to see a bear. I said it was a snake and it was right where he was picking wintergreen. Thankfully no one was bitten. The snake really just wanted to let me know he was down there, as I put my hiking pole down pretty close to him. 
We made it to the PO right at 12:30 to get our package. Hamburg is just a few miles from Port Clinton, but has many many services. We were able to get a ride to Hamburg by calling Cabela’s. They off pick up service at the trail and take you to their store. They gave us discounts at their restaurant and we were able to get some shopping done there. The store was right across the street from our hotel, so it all worked out. 
There is a restaurant and pub attached to the hotel, so we went there for some birthday celebration and who do we see?  Nic 22 and Tuck had been in touch with David and took time off the trail with us to celebrate my birthday. Pretty special day.

Back to Cabala’s for more items, Walmart, Dollar Tree, and a hike to downtown Hamburg post office to send a box home. We decided to send back some items we weren’t using on the trail. I hope that lightens the load over the next trail section. The little downtown section of Hamburg was charming. A mixture of row houses, businesses, and churches.

Back on the trail again after a few days off. We got a ride from Cabela’s back to the Port Clinton post office. We probably were on the trail by 9:45, which made for a short hiking day. We didn’t stop for lunch until 2:30. By the time we ate, cleaned up and had an appropriate rest period, we decided to just stay put at the shelter we stopped at. Total miles were only 6 for the day, far short of the 12 - 13 I thought we would get. We just had a hard time getting back in the groove. 
But that is okay, sometimes you just have to go along with what your body is telling you. It is early to bed and we have everything set aside for breakfast. Our water bottles are filled, so maybe we can get an early start

Most of you know Jessie works at Fry’s Marketplace just a mile from our house. David and I walk up there to get groceries, which is a 2 mile round trip. While we are hiking, sometimes we refer to distance to the next place in terms of how many trips to Fry’s and back we have to go. 
We started out early, as we got a good nights sleep. We managed to put out 16.5 miles today. Lots of rocks to contend with. I think this is a warm up for the final 60 miles of Pennsylvania. One rocky section had reports of snakes in the area. When we got there we found one timber rattler. There was a woman hiking ahead of us and she was having trouble getting around the snake but David came to her aid and got the snake to move away.

Pennsylvania is getting harder. There are more sections of the trail that has extended piles of big, edgy rocks - that is the trail. You have to hop from one to the other to cross the complete field of them. You know when a pile of rocks has a name, it must be something. We had two of those piles today. The first one was “The Knifes Edge”, the second was “Bake Oven Knob”. It is Saturday and nice weather so day hikers were out in number. So are section hikers. We are also starting to run into a new kind of section hiker, one that can hike for a couple of months at a time. They seem to complete the AT in a few years, rather than the section hikers we had been seeing that take about 10 years to complete because they only have a couple of weeks a year. 
We are staying at the Baked Oven Knob Shelter area. Such a mix of people in here. We even have a scout troop camping a little down the trail from us. We just met a couple tonight, Double Tap and Seven. They just met 22 this afternoon and already had heard of us from her. It is weird when you meet someone that knows of you. While I am on the subject of people on the trail, let me introduce you to Ninja and his dog Bones. We have been seeing and crossing paths with Ninja for a couple of days. He is a young black man from New York. He is traveling with his pit bull dog of 1 years old. The two of them are very quiet, you hardly know they are around. I’m pretty sure David posted a picture of them when we crossed paths with them on the trail today. 
The good thing about today is we didn’t see any snakes. I kind of have a theory about those snakes. When they are around, you don’t see any chipmunks or hear birds. More fun and games tomorrow. It will be a shorter day; about 7 miles. We want to stay in a hostel in Palmerton tomorrow night.

Last night the rain started and it has not stopped for very long. The plan today was to hike 7 miles to Palmerton PA and stay at a hostel.  That was the plan even before we knew of the rain. The rain is just the icing on the cake. Rocks are hard enough without being slippery.  
The next day will be a bugger. We have a 1000 ft elevation gain right away that I have heard has some rock scrambling. I’m not a fan of rock scrambling with a 30 pound pack on my back. After that, there is a 4 mile section of trail through a superfund site that does not have much vegetation growing on it. As much as I don’t want rain tomorrow, I don’t want sunshine either. The next water is 14 miles away.  The superfund site is a zinc smelter owned by the New Jersey Zinc Company.  It was declared a superfund site in the 1980s. All vegetation was killed off and they have been trying to replant the area. That is what we have to look forward to tomorrow.  But for tonight at the hostel, it is a full house. The hostel holds 5 and that was full with people who had reservations. There is an overflow area out back, a cement block building with 7 more people (including us).

Well Palmerton turned out to be a pretty neat stop. As o said yesterday, the town was built around the New Jersey Zinc Company. We could see the plant from the mountain we climbed this morning. The building looked like it was about rusted through. We heard sounds coming from the yard down there and there was a semi-truck. Hard to say what was happening there. 
The lady that owns Bert’s Restaurant (and hostel) was an interesting person. I got the feeling she grew up there and had family that worked at the Zinc smelter. She knew all the history of the town. She bought the restaurant from Bert years ago but never changed the name. The food was good there. The lady opened the hostel there when the jail house hostel shut down about 6 years ago. Yes, they turned the jail into a hostel many years ago. It shut down because it got a reputation of a party place and people were taking the toilet paper. Not that they couldn’t manage those issues; they just shut it down. The lady found this out because she noticed the hikers weren’t coming to her restaurant. So she talked to the town and told them how much money the town was losing by not being hiker friendly. She got permission to open the hostel. The bunk room really only holds 5 people; but she uses a building out back to accommodate overflow. Last night she had a record of 18 people. Before that the record was 12. It seems like the bubble of hikers are catching up to us. 
Anyhow, the town was laid out nicely with wide streets that had slanted pull-in parking. The place was immaculate; no trash anywhere. And there were businesses up and down the Main Street.  Many were open on Sunday. They have a very nice Veterans Memorial. It was sponsored by the local grocery store   We noticed on the WW II display, there were as many as 6 people listed from the same family. Some families had both the Sr. and the Jr. listed. It really made you stop to think about what it must have been like to live in a town like that. 
Back to trail talk. The weather was great today. The rain stopped through the night and it appears the cold front coming down from Canada has pushed the band of rain South of us.  We had cooler temperatures, partly cloudy to sunny skies today. Our hike started out with the 1000 ft ascent. That ascent included a rock boulder scramble up the mountain. I think I did very good with it today. There were only a couple of boulder sections today. The PA rocks were mostly smaller rocks all along the trail. Those rocks really slow you down. You just can’t get in a hiking rhythm. It is like walking on legos barefoot while intoxicated. We managed to get 12.6 miles completed. We only have about 23 more miles left in PA. We hear the rocks don’t really stop when we got to NJ. As for the superfund site, it wasn’t all that bad. They are using a detour while they are still trying to replant the affected areas. 
As we got ready to make dinner tonight, 3 young deer visited us. I think we were camping in their favorite dinner spots. Soon we heard this trumpeting sound, sort of like an elephant sound. It was the momma deer telling her young to get back over by her. They just couldn’t figure out how to do that. It took her about 15 minutes to talk them around the situation.

Not that it was planned this way, but since we had a mail drop to get in Wind Gap we stayed overnight there. We didn’t get to the Post Office until about 2:30 and had not had lunch yet. We walked down to the Cafe on Broadway and got some lunch and root beer floats. The food was good and the owner offered to have someone drive us back up to the trail. We said we were staying at the Gateway Motel near the trailhead. She gave us a card that got us a discount there. So for a delicious lunch, a ride to the motel and a $15 discount on the room, I would say we made out pretty good. 
The motel was listed in the app we are using on the trail. It said it was renovated recently. When David called to see if they had room for us, the owner said, “Sure, you can have room 4. It will be unlocked for you. Just go right in.”  Yep, room 4 was unlocked, but no one seemed to be in the office. We called to say we were there, but no towels for the shower. Someone brought them but didn’t want our money. Several more calls about various things before anyone wanted our money. We never did get a room key. The doors had regular keyed locks, not the kind you open with a card. Not that we wanted to go anywhere and needed a key. It was just odd. The motel room was completely renovated, clean and comfortable. Just another odd experience in our travels.

We did it; we pushed all the way to DWG 16.5 miles. So often we miss out on neat places because we get there too early and everything is closed. I wanted to be sure that didn’t happen here. There is a church hostel that operates on donations. We heard back on the trail it was full up but they have a shelter out back, limited space for tents and a ramada. We took our chances and if need be there are a couple of Inns we could try. 
The drop into DWG was so dramatic. Normally, coming down off a mountain into a ‘gap’ is just a 1 mile hike either straight down or sometimes with switchbacks. This was 2.5 miles and brought us along the Delaware River. It is a very popular hiking area. The geology looks like it was carved out by glaciers. There was massive slate rocks, interesting plants, tunnels through rhododendrons, and creek crossing. It sort of reminded me of the Jurassic period. I expect to see dinosaurs. Well no dinosaurs but there were mosquitoes. 
We found the church and quickly learned if we wanted to stay there we should claim that Ramada our front to hang our hammocks from. So we got set up. There were some bushes around it so it wasn’t real obvious we were camping out front of the church. We headed down the street to the Sycamore Grill for dinner. Wow, great food and atmosphere. This was the anniversary dinner we didn’t get the night before. 
Back at the church hostel we are trying to finish setting up for the night when we see lightning in the distance. David checks the weather and says there is a storm front heading our way with 40 mph winds. The Ramada was covered but blowing rain could be a problem, so we get our tarps our to put up a shield from the rain. We couldn’t use the tarps like normal because we couldn’t stake them out. My phone goes off on a weather alert. It was a tornado watch. Advised to take cover indoors from flying debris. I tell David I’m not staying out there, packed everything up haphazardly and go into the church hostel. Soon the power goes out.  About 15 minutes goes by and the tornado warning sirens go off. About 10 later, here comes David with all his stuff packed up. We waited until the storm completely passed before going back out and setting up in the Ramada again. It was well after midnight before we got to bed. 
How is that for fun and excitement in DWG?

We rocked PA 223 miles and over 31,000 ft of ascent and descent.  Even though we completed MD, it is PA that feels like the real accomplishment. 
Leaving DWG we cross the bridge over the Delaware River. About 1/2 way across is the official delineation. We heard NJ has rocks of their own. But I think they are more along the line of the rocky trail kind of rocks. 
Because of the late night we had we got a late start out of DWG. We went to breakfast and then took showers at the church hostel before leaving town. We managed to get 10.5 miles in before ending the day at the Mohican Outdoor Center.  It is a place run by the Appalachian Mountain Club.  They have cabins there, as well as walk in renting. On the weekends you might find scouts or outdoor survival type classes being held. There is a short-order grill and dining room/lounge and showers available. For $10 each we camped and got showers and then ordered some food. 
We have been told NJ has more bears than anywhere else. In fact, there is a juvenile male bear that frequents the campground every night. We were told to be sure to put everything in the bear locker, which we did. For the first time, we saw a bear tonight. Our friend “22” took a video of him crawling into the trash dumpster and taking a bag out of it. We didn’t hear anything else that night.  You can be sure we will be very careful while we are in NJ. I’m sure there have been bears around us before but we are usually in bed before dark and have hung our food every night.

Yep, NJ has rocks too. They just slow you down. The forest in NJ is different, too. So far in VA, MD and PA the forest was mostly covered with heavy tree foliage. NJ has long stretches where the vegetation is shrubs with no trees or the trees just aren’t that big or close to the trail.  Sun exposure is now more of a concern than it has been.
Oh, and NJ has rattlesnakes, too. I saw one on the trail today. I don’t know how David missed him. He had to have passed him before me. The snake alerted me with a rattle and I alerted him with a shriek. We both have a pretty sophisticated alert system. 
We are stealth camping right across from Crater Lake. A man passing on the trail tonight said we could swim in the lake. You know, take a bath if we wanted. I think I will wait for a real shower, thank you. 
Tomorrow we will go off trail into a town to get grocery resupply for the box we picked up in Wind Gap. I have to say the boxes we packed are working out pretty good. A nice variety of food. We feel the meals are packed with enough nutrition because we feel very satisfied. Some people on the trail say they wake up very hungry in the morning, like they didn’t eat enough the day before.  We weighed ourselves at the Mohican Outdoor Center and we feel we have only lost about 10 pounds each. Believe me, we both needed to lose that 10 pounds.

We finally went to a grocery store to resupply the box we picked up days ago in Wind Gap. Sometimes it is hard to find time to travel to a town that has a Walmart or grocery store big enough. Now that we are in NJ the shopping landscape has changed. We passed through a little community just outside of Branchville today. We took the opportunity to also get lunch since the restaurant was just 1/10 of a mile from the trail. Great burgers and fries, and the backside of the restaurant opened out onto Culver Lake. There isn’t much to this town.  It is mainly a vacation home town. The 2010 Branchville census had the population at about 680 people. The grocery was called Dale’s Market. It was the smallest IGA type grocery I’ve ever seen. We got most of what we were looking for but will have to be creative to compensate for the items we couldn’t get.  
You aren’t supposed to hitchhike in NJ.  But David did in the parking lot of the restaurant.  He was hoping a patron would offer a ride to the grocery that was a couple of miles away, on a road you wouldn’t want to be walking on. Quickly a car pulled in and offered us a ride. David checked Uber but none were available. Coincidentally, the girl that picked us up lives in PA and is an Uber driver. Her passenger was also an Uber driver in New York. But since they were in NJ they aren’t allowed to pick up fares here.  I guess we Ubered ourselves some good luck. At the grocery we were offered a ride back to the trailhead by someone else. 
Talking about trail magic, we were offered some twice on the trail today. One was a cold Coke and a king size Snickers bar. The second time was just fun size Snickers. The crazy thing about the first offer is the guy who offered is now staying at the shelter we are at tonight.
Most of the time we take a hotel or hostel stay when we resupply; but today we had time to get back on the trail and hike another 3 miles. I’m glad it worked out this way. Tomorrow is going to be hot so we want to get an early start.

Suddenly, we are back to hiking in the forest. Yesterday, we finished the ridge line that was mostly scrub Oak and lots of exposure to the sun. I like hiking in the forest much better. 
Water is becoming more scarce now. The guidebook lists water sources that I wouldn’t consider water sources. Things like beaver ponds. So far in VA, MD, and PA the sources were things like springs and streams, with an occasional water spigot. But in NJ they consider a beaver pond good enough to drink out of if you filter/treat the water. Of course those other states didn’t have things like ponds or lakes along the way. 
Our water sources for the day were spigots. We passed the High Point State Park headquarters. They offer hikers a cold Pepsi for stopping in. Then we climbed the mountain to reach the High Point Monument. There is a tower up there where you can see the states of NJ, NY, and PA. The view was nice but the real surprise was Lake Maria. It is a favorite of the locals. A real nice park with a swimming area, picnic area, concession stand and free hot showers. Of course the hot shower was our focus. We are 4 days out from our last shower. We only have camp soap and a small amount of baby shampoo which isn’t much to wash up with; but it was so nice to wash the salts off. I even washed my shirt, shorts, underwear and socks. The hike to the shelter was another half mile uphill and we were all sweaty again; but with less salt on our bodies. 
We seem to be traveling with the same group of people that we have been for the last three days. We all end up at the same shelters. The 2 ladies from Denmark, Dirty Girl and Valkyrie are here tonight. We spent some time getting to know them and what prompted them to travel here to hike this trail. Dirty Girl read the book “A Walk in the Woods “ by Bill Bryson and talked about it at work for 6 years. She works in a family business and her boss said when are you going to take that hike. He pushed so hard she took the next 2 years to plan it out and start in 2018. She was going to do this alone; but her daughter, Valkyrie, decided to try backpacking and came along with her. They have some fascinating stories.

Today was the hottest day so far. We weren’t sure how far we would get. We wanted to get up early but couldn’t manage to leave before 7:45. At least the hiking was pretty easy today. Lots of level and smooth trail today. 
Our first water source today was a little private cabin with a well. The man that owns the property hiked the trail in the 1990s and had a little cabin for hikers if they need it. You can camp there if you want. It was only 4 miles into the day so we just came for the water. In the cabin he has maps hung up of different trails around the US and some electricity to charge your phone. On the side of his cabin is an outdoor shower. 
We hiked on to the edge of Unionville, NY. Right now we are riding the state line between NJ and NY. We went into town to get lunch and pick up a few things that weren’t at the last store. Mostly looking for lunch items. We have been sustaining with nuts, dried fruits, and power bars. The town was quaint and the General Store has a great deli and items we were looking for. They are hiker friendly, so they have a big front porch with chairs and outlets for charging your electronics while you wait. They had American flag bunting and hanging baskets of flowers. In spite of the heat, there was a good breeze. 
The town has a little park they let you camp in but it seemed too early in the day to stop. The town doesn’t have a hostel or hotel. Other hikers were pushing on to the next shelter and the hiking was on level ground for the most part. We hiked on, too. We got our water and cold Gatorade and hit the trail. David said his thermometer read 91 degrees with 60% humidity. Heat index of 103. 
The trail took us through a wetlands nature preserve. Some of the trail was shaded by the trees around the perimeter; but there was plenty that wasn’t shaded and it was HOT. I didn’t think I would make it to the end of this section; but then the trail turned right into the woods and you had to walk on wooden planks through a marshy section. At least you were in the shade. The nature preserve was pretty neat. I would want to go back when the temperature was nicer. We saw red-winged black birds and some pink flowers that made big pom pom balls. There was purple thistle 5 foot high. 
At the end of the preserve was a house owned by the National Forest Service. It is vacant now; but they keep the water on for hikers. I wanted to lay down under that spigot. I did pour a bottle of water over my head and face. We both washed up the best we could and took the final ascent up the mountain to the shelter. Everyone seemed to make it here just fine in spite of the hot day. Thunderstorms are predicted for tonight after the hot day. 
Thankfully, we have a short day of 6 miles tomorrow. We have not had a zero day since June 6, so we are taking some time off the trail in Vernon, NJ.

We continued through some low wetlands sanctuary after climbing over Pochuck Mountain. Along the trail was a snake that just didn’t move off the trail. When David looked closer, the snake had it’s mouth around a toad that was 3 times bigger around than the snake. It wasn’t a venomous snake, according to another hiker. 
Once we got over the mountain, there was another section of the wetlands to cross. You will find a picture of the boardwalk over the 9/10s of a mile structure we had to walk over. When we got to the boardwalk we saw one of our hiker friends talking on the phone with her tent poles out. We didn’t know it but last night she broke her tent pole and slept in the shelter. Well, you know how handy David is, he fixed it for her. The company she was talking to was going to charge her $71 to send her another set of poles. We got there just in time.  
The sanctuary was just as neat as the day before. You will have to check out David’s pictures. Turtles, suspension bridge, and song birds singing so sweetly. 
We ended the day with ice cream at the market where we got off the trail. Tonight, no hammock for us. We are staying at a hotel and taking a zero day tomorrow.

AT - 6/20 Day 50. What is in a Trail Name?

We are on a zero day so there is nothing new on the trail to report.  However, I challenge you to create a trail name for yourself.
As we hike along and meet people, one of the things we always ask and are asked is , “What’s your trail name?  Where are you from?” 
I thought it would be fun for all of you to create a trail name for yourself and email it to me in this Trail Journal app. I will then post your trail names but mix them up with your real name and see if you can guess how they match up. Just hit the email envelope button at the bottom of this post and send me the trail name you pick out for yourself. My email address is rlindner@cox.net.  It is always better to name yourself than to have your fellow hikers name you. 
Here’s a few of the many people we have met on the trail and a little something about them, for inspiration.

Cactus Dave_Desert Rose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595533,"AT - 6/21. Day 51. New York State 
We finished New Jersey today about 4:00. It was strange to hike from one state to another on just a dirt path. Normally, you cross over to a city on a major street or bridge or something. But this time they just painted the rock to show you the state line. I have mixed feelings about that. I can’t say New Jersey was super easy; but I think all the rest of the states are going to be harder. New Jersey was a friendly state. We had more trail magic in NJ than all the other states put together. Soft drinks, Snickers, rides to the store and trail head. We were even offered grilled burgers at the lake on Father’s Day. All the local people we met on the trail were very friendly. This part of NJ is not what you would expect. 
New York, on the order hand is exactly what people told us. The first 40 miles is rock scrambles and little water. We got our water bottles filled up at a start park office in NJ. The water is from a well and had a high concentration of iron that gives it a funky taste; but it is potable water and we are grateful to have it. We only have 2.5 miles to hike tomorrow before we get to a little community called Greenwood Lake. We are camped on the hills above it and the houses look expensive from here. There were boats out on the lake this afternoon. We will have to buy a gallon of water at the convenience market. David said they were warning people about the springs, creeks and streams being dried up on Facebook. Once we get past these 40 miles we should be okay. It is just stressful to think you might run out of water. Trail angels are known to leave jugs of water at road crossings but you can’t count on that. 
If there’s one positive thing I can say about NY it is that we are close enough to NYC right now to be able to see the NYC skyline and north to Long Island.  We will get a better view when we cross the Hudson River in a couple of days. People say once you cross the Hudson the trail conditions get better. I certainly hope so.

Cactus Dave_Desert Rose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595534,"AT - 6/22  Day 52 You Can’t Turn Down Trail Magic 
Twice today trail magic was bestowed upon us. Until we hit NJ we really didn’t have much magic to talk about. And who would think NJ residents would take time to help the hiking community out. But here we are in NY and still getting magic. 
Our first encounter came in the early afternoon, just after we ate a combination of breakfast and lunch. Yesterday, I told you how scarce water is in this part of NY. Well we had to decide this morning if we were going to use the little water we had to make breakfast or save it to drink on our way to the next water location that was 4 miles away. We decided to skip breakfast and headed out on the trail. We knew we could get water at The Creamery, an ice cream stand. They are hiker friendly and allow you to get water from their spigot and have recently added a charging station. We got there about 10:30 but the restaurant doesn’t open until noon. The story of our life; we are either too early or too late. Anyhow, with ample water available we decided to eat some breakfast and some lunch, as well as, camel up for the afternoon hike. 
We had just gotten on the trail and came to a road crossing where a man sitting by his car called our attention to come over and enjoy some trail magic. He was a thru hiker a couple of years ago. His trail name is Tent Man and he lives in NJ. We are still close to the NJ/NY boarder. He offered us sodas, fruit, candy and then Darn Tough socks. He used to work in the outdoor industry and Darn Tough sends him socks to give away. We enjoyed our chat with him and met a new hiker by the name is Stickers. He started in GA and had some interesting stories, too. 
Headed out on the trail again and a couple of hours later came to another road crossing and met Storm, the area trail maintainer who had placed a cooler of cold drinks out for hikers. He was finishing up cleaning an area where locals like to hike and party. He told us about his section of trail he presides over and told us what we could expect up ahead. Both times we enjoyed meeting local people who were knowledgeable about the trail ahead. 
Just after crossing that road there is a small wooden bridge that crosses a nearly dry creek. We stopped on that bridge to get something out of David’s pack and a yellow jacket stung me right through 2 pairs of socks. No stinger to remove but it sure hurt. I’m glad I’m not allergic to stings. 
A pretty descent day of hiking in spite of all the socializing we did 9.9 miles. Not sure what tomorrow will bring. Instead of riding the ridge line like we have been doing we will be crossing over ridges, one after the other, for the next 25 miles until we get to Ft. Montgomery where our next box was delivered.

Cactus Dave_Desert Rose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595535,"AT - 6/23 Day 53. Water Caches
You all know how worried I have been about finding water sources. All the comments on our app about streams say they are dry. We have seen comments that there are water jugs left by trail angels at some road crossings but we have also seen they are empty. With today being Saturday, we hoped we would find full jugs of water. And we did. Three road crossings in a row had a total of 56 jugs of water. We still have more than 20 miles to go before we will find springs and streams flowing. Each day you have to plan your food and hike based on the water. The good thing about today is the temperature didn’t get above 65 degrees. That is great hiking weather. 
The hiking was intense today. We covered fewer miles but had as much ascent and descent as we had on other big mile days. It wore me down. We started down a steep descent and ran into a couple of men who just came up that trail. They said it was hard. David thought they looked like they were new to hiking and didn’t give their report much credit.  That is until we got down. We saw a trail sign with mileage to different places. They gave that hill a name of View via Agony Grind.  How appropriate. 
Just after that we crossed the road to enter Harriman State Park. We camped there last year when we went on our trip to visit family on the East coast. We never explored where the AT went through the park. Now we know. Just the fact we are in a state park makes the trails different. They are wider, better maintained and generally easier on the feet. You can also bet you are going to see some neat things. The forest is very mature with the tallest of trees and the undergrowth is minimal. You feel like an incredible shrinking person walking here. There are beautiful lakes and ponds. One of the popular hikes goes to a spot right on the AT called Lemon Squeezer. It is just a skinny walkway through a couple of boulders. You have to take your pack off to get through  it. Right after that is a difficult climb up some rocks if you are carrying a pack. They provide an easier way around that part. David took the hard way; I took the easier way. Even the easy way involved climbing. We heard from some people there that someone fell from the hard way earlier in the day. I don’t think it required any emergency medical treatment; but it goes to show you there is an element of danger there. 
Finishing the hike up that hill, we found our perfect stealth camping spot. It overlooked a lake and had a decent amount of privacy from the trail. The ground had a good bit of tundra covering it without a lot of other growth to get in the way when we set up our hammocks. I think this is my favorite stealth camp spot so far.
As we climb into bed at 7:30 I can hear light rain starting to fall and then it quit in just a couple of minutes. It didn’t take David long to fall asleep; I can hear his breathing get heavy.

Cactus Dave_Desert Rose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595536,"AT - 6/24 Day 54. Dangerous Road Crossings 
More on road crossings in a minute. We woke this morning to heavy fog. We figured out it wasn’t rain last night but fog moving in and condensing on the leaves of trees then falling lightly on our tarps. It went on all night. Now I understand the tundra. It must be foggy here most evenings up above the lake. Everything felt damp; not wet but damp. That’s the way it is on the trail. You learn to live with what you are given. 
A cool morning hike before the sun broke through. Our first water of the day was a a lake picnic area called Tiorati Circle. It was about 3 miles on the trail and we had another source later in the day. That was a relief to know water wasn’t going to be that bad. We made it to Tiorati Circle by 10:00. The app says they have a picnic area with restrooms, a snack bar, beach, showers and water spigots. Sounded great. When we got there, they were holding a bicycle race and cars were pour  into the picnic grounds like it was Disneyworld. We found out the concessions and showers weren’t open until 11. We decided to use the picnic area to make a snack and just wash up in the restrooms. This area is still within the Harriman State Park. I’m not sure just how much of the park has the AT in it’s boundaries; but you can kind of tell the trail is just a bit nicer. 
Our second stop for water was at a visitor center on the Palisades Parkway. It was described as being in the median of the parkway and it has a water spigot, restrooms, and vending machines. Well we get to the road and have to cross 2 lanes of speeding cars headed Southbound to get to the median. Then we had to walk a half a mile along the median to get to what most of us would call a roadside rest. There is a map of New York showing you where you are. This Palisades Parkway is also known as the New York Through Way. So the AT crosses 2 lanes of speeding New Yorkers heading South and then crosses 2 more lanes of speeding New Yorkers heading North. This is Sunday late afternoon, so I don’t know what it looks like any other day or time. We spent a long time watching cars whiz by to get the timing of a break in traffic in order to cross the first 2 lanes of traffic. What is crazy is they don’t see the danger. There are multiple hiking paths that cross this road. In the median we met a couple of young men who had a map of local hiking trails and we discussed where the Visitors Center might be. And hiking along the median a car honked at us like we were crazy walking along the road. I don’t think anyone knows there are hiking trails that cross the road. And when you get to the Visitor Center there was a sign on the door saying the restroom was out of order. So many people pulled in there just for the restroom. They were all pretty mad. 
Well we made it across the Parkway in one piece. When we cross roads like that we always say, “Turtles crossing the road .”  I’m sure that is what we look like. You can’t run very fast with a backpack on. 
Stealth camping again tonight. We got dinner done and got in bed in the nick of time. A thunderstorm broke out just as we settled in. We got caught in a small thunderstorm earlier in the afternoon. I thought that was all we would get; but as I type this report the rain is coming down hard. 
Tomorrow we will make it to Fort Montgomery to pick up another mailed box. It will be 5 days since our last motel stay. We will get there early enough to get laundry done and have a nice dinner. I love the hotel stays.

Cactus Dave_Desert Rose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595537,"AT - 6/25 Day 55. Unexpected Sight-Seeing Right On The Trail 
We finished Harriman State Park today with a bang. The mission was to get to Ft. Montgomery to pick up our next box at the PO. It was only about 7 miles away but we had to cross 2 mountains, West Mountain and Bear Mountain. Reports have said West Mountain is a tough one but nothing was said about Bear Mountain. While we were on West Mountain we met up with Viva, our friend that had the broken tent poles. It was good to see her again and find out the repair held up, even in the downpour we had last night.  She hiked along with us to the top of Bear Mountain. 
At the top of Bear Mountain there was a big stone tower, Perkins Memorial Tower, that you could walk up in and see all the way to NYC. It was a 360 degree view of all the surrounding mountains. It was neat to see the mountains we had just hiked over the past week. Both the hike up and down Bear Mountain was the best we have had. This is a big recreation area within Harriman State Park and they had stone steps almost completely up and down the mountain. At the bottom of the mountain is a huge recreation area, complete with Bear Mountain Inn built by the CCC in the 1920s. In the recreation area there is a lake, concessions, picnic area, swimming pool, and a trail side zoo and museum run on donations only . I was surprised to see how many people were at this park on a Monday. It was just as busy as the Grand Canyon. I tried my best to yogi some lamb kabobs but the girls weren’t biting. 
I learned at the zoo that we have been hiking through Sugar Maple forests. The trees are so tall and straight. Beautiful trees. 
Ft. Montgomery is rich with Revolutionary War history; but we didn’t really have the time to explore the exhibits. We picked up our box and stayed at one of the cutest motels on the trail. It was one of those independent motels you drive by and wonder what they are like inside. This one is a 5 unit cottage style motel and owner’s house. The motel was built back in the 1950s so the room was small in size but had everything we needed. We ate dinner across the street at a BBQ place. After 3 beers I wasn’t much help with preparing for tomorrow; but I felt no pain.

Cactus Dave_Desert Rose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595538,"AT - 6/26. Day 26. New York Storm Destruction 
Starting at the Hudson River we headed over the bridge. You can see train tracks along both sides of the Hudson. It looks like one side is for Amtrak and the other is for freight trains. We saw several trains in the time it took us to cross the half mile bridge. And once we ascended the next mountain and walked the ridge line along the Hudson we heard soft train whistles every 15 minutes. It was the Harriman family who built the bridge and owned the railroad. The bridge is still a toll bridge run by NY State ; but when they first built the bridge in the 1920s it was a private toll bridge. They charged $1 to cross in a car and if you had passengers it was $.15 each. That was a lot of money back then. Anyhow, the Harriman were big around here back then. 
This afternoon we walked through a section of forest that was devastated by the storm back in May. We heard NY and NJ was reporting a lot of blown down trees. We didn’t see this kind of destruction in NJ at all. A few days ago we met the Area Captain for the trail volunteers. He was handling out some trail magic of cold drinks. He said when NY had that storm, one of his volunteers quickly thought to buy white plastic tape and go out to re-route the trail around all the damaged area. They did a good job of getting the trees that were blocking the trail cut up. Check out the pictures David posted

Today’s big discovery was finding the remains of a stone building use to inoculate Continental soldiers against small pox in the year 1790. There were all kinds of stone walls in the area. They were thicker than the ones we have been seeing that mark property boundaries. You could see the outline of several buildings in the area. You just never know what you are going to discover from day to day.  Walking through these parts makes me want to read more about the history of the areas. I’d love to know more about how they inoculated people in those days. 
We stopped early today but still got in our 10 miles. There is a big storm front coming in with rain forecasted through the night and into the early hours tomorrow. I wanted to be sure to stop early enough to get set up before a downpour. It started sprinkling when we got near  Canopus Lake. We wanted to stop here anyhow to get water and possibly a meal from the concession stand. There is a beach area and they have showers for people to rinse off. They also offer AT thru hikers an area to camp for free. If I have to be stuck in my hammock I might as well be clean and fed with restrooms nearby. We got here about 2:30 and so far there hasn’t been more than a few sprinkles. We might end up being the only ones camping here. You never know, if the rain does hit it might empty the trail and we could wake up to a field of tents. At 5:30 pm I’m not sure if there’s anyone else out there.

Cactus Dave_Desert Rose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595773,"AT - 6/28 Day 58. Rain Delay, More May Storm Destruction, and a Guy Named Harvey Lewis 
Last nights rain was a something. The storm came around about 3 times during the night and then thunderstorms started up about 5:30 am. We didn’t hit the trail until about 9:30 and there was some confusion about the connector trails back to the AT. They had some maps hanging up but they were partial in that they never really showed where the AT was. Anyhow we just went back to the trail we came in on which was a bit of back tracking for us. 
The humidity was 100% this morning so everything you drank was sweated out quickly. We walked through many areas of storm destruction from May. David took lots of pictures. What all the trees had in common was shallow root systems. I guess the ground has bedrock so close to the top of the soil the roots just spread out at the surface. These are huge trees. I can’t imagine what it must have been like to be out on the trail when that storm hit here. I don’t think there were reports of anyone being injured here. 
Lastly, there was a runner by the name of Harvey Lewis from Cincinnati that passed us on the trail. He is trying to set a record for completing the AT. He doesn’t carry anything and has someone running with him to give him things like water. When he passed us he wasn’t running. The trail had been a bit difficult with slippery rocks so fast walking was more like it. We did benefit from it though. Up until today, the trail has not been marked all that well. But now that Harvey can’t spend time looking for white blazes, there are markings everywhere. Even on some rocks jutting out of the ground so that he can see them more easily. I guess that is something. 
Again, rain late this afternoon. We hoped to finish the day before it came. Instead we hiked in the rain for a half hour before ending the day.

The time has come for me to return to civilized life. I have reached my peak of inconveniences and this hike is not as fun as it was when we started. Sure, I look forward to discovering a hidden treasure each day; to share with you; but the daily grind and all that goes with it is wearing me down. The heat and humidity, biting and stinging insects, rain, water concerns, sweaty smelly clothes, sore knees, and more have me wanting to suspend this trip. 
We accomplished more than I thought possible - 585 trail miles.  We met some of the most interesting people along the way. We discovered historic sites that you can’t find by just driving around. I’m pretty sure David and I are in better physical health than we were before we started. By most people’s measurements, we had great success. 
David agreed that we would hike as far as we could and make changes to the plan as we went along. When I said I really wanted to go home, he agreed we would both leave the trail. This morning we decided to take a train to New York City and fly home. 
Just this morning we met a woman who we heard about on the trail from AZ. We met her at the laundromat, of all places. Everyone wanted to know if we knew her. She returned to the trail this year after attempting a thru hike a couple of years ago. She left to get both knees replaced. So far, her knees are doing great but she still has some issues with the tendons and ligaments. Trails are rough on the knees. She listened to our story and congratulated us on how far we came. She said if it wasn’t fun anymore it was time to leave. We heard that from a lot of people who have returned as section hikers. 
Before we came home we had to retrieve a couple of packages we had sent to us. Plus, we needed to call the place we had our next food box sent. I was speaking to the woman who runs the place about the box, so she went to check if it was our box she received today. Then she handed the phone to someone else because she was having trouble hearing on the phone. When I said “My name is Rose”, the other person asked if I was Desert Rose. The other person was our trail friend 22. She was staying at the place we sent our box. What are the chances of that?  Trail family has a peculiar way of finding one another. 
I know we still have a lot of hiking to do. It will probably be closer to home. I look forward to coming home to family and friends. You all have been tremendous support and kept me in the game longer than you know. Thanks for following our story.
