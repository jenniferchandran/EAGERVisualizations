Twofer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579974,"This summer I got a chance to visit the White Mountains in New Hampshire. My 2 sons, Matt and Ben along with Gaby and Molly, planned a 3 day 2 night hike on the Pemi Loop and they invited me. The first day we did a little over 13 miles with 3500 feet elevation gain. We slowed down a bit after that but it was an awesome trip. It was a good reminder for me of how beautiful and tough the Whites are. If things go as planned, I'll have 1800 miles of conditioning before tackling the Whites again",,View Entry,"Oct 26, Thu",0
Twofer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580051,"The AT runs from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mt Katahdin in Maine. The vast majority is foot travel only. The trail goes through 14 states and is 2190 miles long. In 2007 it took me right at 6 months to complete it. I'm guessing that my pace will be similar this time. So what are the chances of completing a thru-hike, not good. Normally about 20 -25 % of the people who set out to hike the trail actually complete it. I do have a much better idea of what I'm getting into but I'm not sure that's a big indicator on whether a person completes the trail. I am looking forward to meeting new people, being in nature, camping in different places, getting in shape and enjoying the long distance hiker lifestyle.

Twofer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583355,"I start my Appalachian Trail (AT) hike this Friday. This post will give a little information about the trail and hiker lingo!
The AT is a 2190.7 mile trail from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mt Katahdin in Maine. It travels through 14 states, GA, NC, TN, VA, WV, MD, PA, NJ, NY, CT, MA, VT, NH, and ME.  I will be attempting a Thru-Hike.  This means that I plan on hiking the entire trail in a single year which is the common definition of a thru-hike, but there are no official rules on what constitutes a thru-hike.
The trail is marked with white blazes which are 2"" wide by 6"" tall rectangles painted on trees, rocks, road signs, etc. So all you have to do is get to Springer Mt and then follow the white blazes to Maine. There are different ways to hike a thru-hike. I am doing a northbound hike (NOBO) which is the direction most people go. Some people do a southbound (SOBO) hike and others do a flipflop which is hiking the entire trail but not all in the same direction, i.e. hike GA to WV then jump to Maine and hike back to WV.
I plan to hike past every white blaze, but there are side trails marked by blue blazes that sometimes shortcut past parts of the AT. Taking those short cuts is called blue blazing. Yellow blazing is when someone hitch hikes around parts of the trail. Other acronyms, HYOH - hike your own hike, AT2018 = a 2018 thru hike, AYCE - all you can eat buffet (you can't carry enough food to keep up with the calories you burn, so town food becomes a major obsession!)  Georgia (GA) to Maine (ME) = GAME.                                                                                   Starting Friday it's GAME on!",,View Entry,"Feb 26, Mon",0

There has been so much rain here that the gravel/dirt roads are pretty soft. We decided not to drive our truck up there. I arranged a shuttle to get up to the trail. I'll get picked up at the visitors center here at 9:30am tomorrow. The weather looks good here for the next 3 days.
We've been lazy today. Drove a mail drop to Neels Gap, that I'll pick up Tuesday.

I then walked 1 mile south to the summit of Springer, took some pictures, then headed north.For as much rain as they've had, the trail is in great shape. Trees still aren't leafed out, so you can see farther than normal. I felt good hiking, and then the last couple miles reminded me that I'm not close to hiking shape yet!Camping at a tent site area that wasn't here 11 years ago. It had 30 tent pads, 3 bear boxes for storing food, a privy, and a water source. Everything a hiker needs!  A hiker named Atlas is here, too. He is on Trail Journals also.It's 6pm and most tentsites are occupied.

It warmed up quickly, and by 10:30 I was hiking in shorts and a t-shirt. One tough climb over Sasafras Mt along with many smaller ups and downs.

We had a fun group around the campfire last night, but it started sprinkling and people scattered to their tents. Several good downpours during the night. Light rain when I woke up, so I packed everything into my pack while sitting in my tent then got out and packed up my tent. I retrieved my food bag from the bear cables on my way out of the campsite. I got warmed up going uphill in my rain gear. As the morning wore on the temps dropped and the rain picked up - nothing to do but keep hiking. Blood Mt was the last big climb and on a good day you can see Springer Mt. Today we could see about 200 ft! On the descent to Neels Gap people got talking about getting out of the weather, and that if four people went together, we could rent a cabin for less than staying in the hostel. So Danny, Leah, Ester and I split a cabin. We got cleaned up, laundry done, gear dryed out, and ate pizza and wings. Ester is from Holland and is still working on converting liters (her gear) to cups (US food). Leah is from North Carolina and Danny is from Indiana. All in all another good but different kind of day on the AT!

Walked over to Neels Gap and bought a few supplies, had a cup of coffee, then headed out. Big climb to start the day which helped warm me up. There were snow flurries in the air, and then wind was blowing 25-30 mph. It was cold in the wind and nice when the wind was blocked. Eleven ups and downs today-- some steep and some pretty nice grades also. At one road crossing I hear a ""Hi Twofer."" It was David, a guy I have talked to a few times. He camped out last night and didn't get dried out from the rain. He was waiting on a shuttle to a hostel. Cold weather and wet clothes are not a good combo.

Hopefully Matt (oldest son) is coming to hike a few days with me, but it depends on the health of his dog, Harley who's coming, too. If Harley is medically cleared to hike, they should be here Sunday late or Monday.A short day tomorrow and a zero day Sunday should do my feet and legs some good!

Besides eating (I think my hiker appetite is starting to kick in), I bought groceries for the next 4 days. I also bought some cheap insoles for my boots. I have decided that I need a half-size larger boot, but the 2 outfitters in town don't carry hiking boots! The cheaper insoles should give me a little more room until I get to Franklin, NC in 40 miles. I may lose a toenail or 2 which sounds worse than it is, but I do need to get that fixed. The downhills  can be hard on toes.Matt (aka Knobs) and Harley won't make it out this week, but it does sound like Harley is on the mend. Hopefully, they make it out at a later date so that I can dominate Knobs in cribbage.Talked to Julie today, thanks for handling everything on the home front. Love you!I also got to talk to Paul (aka Brewmaster). He has started his training for when he hikes with me for a couple weeks this summer.  While talking to Paul, Danny and Ester stopped by my room, bringing me a beer and a bag of potato chips.  We chatted a bit and then went out and grabbed some dinner.

Official elevation is 5498 feet. The trail had switchbacks, so the grade wasn't too steep. I also passed by a side trail named Chunky Gal Trail.

Most of the trail was well graded - until I got to Albert Mt.  The last 400 feet climb was steep, but the view at the top was amazing - my second time over 5000 feet.

The sun was shining, and I could see the snow in the mountains. After crossing the dam, I entered Smoky Mountain National Park. My pack is heavy with 7 days of food loaded in it, and the trail is mostly uphill. The higher I climbed, the more snow I found. Fortunately I wasn't the first up the trail, so I had footprints to follow.  There were probably 3 -5 inches of snow, but some drifts were 2 feet deep. No easy places to take breaks, so I kept hiking.When I got to Mollie Ridge Shelter, it was packed, and there were many hikers that I hadn't seen for a few days. I sat, had a snack, and then hiked on. It was another 3.3 miles to this shelter, and when I got here there was plenty of room. There are tarps across the front of the shelter and a fireplace inside.  Mongo got a fire going even though the wood is damp, now there is a good bed of coals. I'm on the upper level. Three guys came in after me, and there is still room. It's 7:45 -- I am in my sleeping bag and warm!

I've gotten more of my book read than I had the entire trip!  Tang had some podcasts to listen to and took a nap. We are both warm and dry!
Tomorrow is suppose to be cold but hopefully with less precip!Tang's take:I followed Twofer right into a monsoon today. I have stayed dry in my hammock for the last 3 hours and hopefully it continues to hold out the rain into the evening.  Twofer has taught me a lot on the trail, but the most important thing he’s taught me, so far, is how to eat peanut M&Ms.  You eat them two at a time in certain color patterns to give you extra power.  First you eat the Orange and Brown for Halloween, then Blue and Green for Sky and Earth, and then Red and Yellow for cyclONE Power.  Naturally the last color combination tastes the best.

Our only water bottle with water in it was frozen.  Tang got the lovely experience of putting on frozen boots! Wind was crazy last night, also.  A couple times it felt like the wind might take the roof right off the shelter. We managed to get some sleep, but we were slow to get hiking.  I also got to see a spotted skunk up close a couple times in the night.  Shining my headlamp on him made him leave.  It's about the size of a squirrel and knows how to get to the second level in the shelter. 
We were hiking through Grayson Highlands.  I had wanted to do it on a good weather day; this wasn't ideal.  Everything was covered in snow, so it was hard to tell what you were stepping on, and the going was slow. The wind was blowing hard up top-- we'd be walking straight and then get blown a couple steps sideways.  Eventually we dropped some elevation and got in the trees. We were hoping to see wild ponies and finally saw 2 by the trail.  We pet one and took a picture, then hiked a little further and saw 4 more-- right as we got to Wise Shelter.  Espresso and Clover were still in the shelter, so we told them about the 4 ponies that were close. Clover was excited, and they went to see them.  We ended up seeing 17 ponies.The afternoon hike had some more open, exposed areas.  The wind hadn't let up, but the sun was out.  We stopped at one point, pulling out my tent and Tang's hammock to dry them and noticed my pack cover was gone!  Ten minutes later Espresso showed up with the pack cover!! We hiked to this campsite, dropping 1400 feet in elevation.  There is no snow here!  We set up camp and even had a fire. A nice ending to a frozen start of the day!Tang's take:Today started out super fun.  Twofer and I slept in a shelter last night with a bunch of guys in what felt like 0 degree weather.  This morning we woke up and ice skated across the Grayson Highlands.  The winds were so strong I couldn’t walk in a straight line at times. The weather improved, and we were able to see 17 wild ponies.  I was tempted to hop on one and ride it to my car.  Had a fire tonight, enjoyed some good conversation, and enjoyed some hot chocolate.  Time for bed!

He also gave me some fuel for my stove. There was a big crowd as some hikers had been waiting a couple days to hike. Once I started into the section, it didn't take long to get to the burn area. It burned right up to the trail but didn't cross it. The trail made a little fire break and the fire fighters had set fires from the AT to burn back down to the fire.

The dogs did well in the tent last night.  They were bothered when the barred owls were calling, but we got decent sleep. Tomorrow we hope to get back to Daleville which is a little over 18 miles, so we need a bit earlier start!

It rained some in the night, but the morning was nice.  We decided to hike a bit before making the dogs breakfast.  After 3 miles we came to a pull off on the Blue Ridge Parkway that had a picnic table and a trashcan.  (We didn't have to carry our trash anymore - on the AT the little things are big things! )  There were also nice views of the valley below.  Mostly we kept moving.  We had a couple of big climbs and then it was downhill into town.  The dogs are catching on to this hiking thing. Harley and I have been following Knobs and Frida, and the first time we came to switchbacks Harley wanted to shortcut the trail, now she just follows the trail to the turn.  They also did well in the tent and learned quickly that when we stopped, they needed to get their naps in!

The first few miles were fairly flat, and then there were climbs up to Spy Rock and on up to the Priest Mt. I had a long lunch at Priest Shelter and got to talk to Julie and Likito (one of Gaby's nephews). Likito had a lot of good questions such as 1) Do I get scared?  Not really, I feel very safe out here. 2) Do I get lonely?  Sometimes, I miss family and friends. 3) Do I get into towns?  Yes, every 4 - 6 days to resupply and clean up.  That's a brief summary of the conversation. 
After that I finished my lunch:  pb on a tortilla, and I cooked a ramen.  It was 2 by the time I started hiking again, and it was hot.  The climb down the Priest was a 3000 foot drop, different sets of muscles working.  I got down, crossed a road, then climbed 1100 feet.  I was drenched in sweat by the time I got to the top, so I decided I'd walk slowly the last half mile to my campsite to cool down and hopefully dry out a bit.  Then I heard the thunder, that quickened my pace!  I came to a stream crossing and quickly got 2 liters of water as the rain started.  I hustled up the short hill to the campsite. Rooster was setup and in his tent and another guy was just finishing setting up.  I located a flat spot and quickly set up my tent and put my pack inside.  I was pretty wet by the time I got the fly staked out and myself into the tent.

After yesterday's heat and my late start, I decided that I wouldn't push the 20 miles to Harper's Ferry and instead shoot for a campsite 4 miles short of there.  The first 4.6 miles today were finishing up the Roller Coaster, so it was up and down.  I chatted with a couple from Philadelphia doing section hikes.  A bit later there was a group taking a break on the trail, and they asked if I wanted a brownie-- I dropped my pack and sat down!  They were celebrating one women's 70th birthday.  They gave me some chicken, watermelon, blueberries and pistachios to go with the brownies!  Two of the women had hiked the John Muir trail, so they know hiking. I took a lunch break about 2:00 and realized that I had only hiked 8 of the planned 16 miles, so figured I'd better hike faster for a while.  The terrain was easier, so that helped.  Two miles before this campsite, I came to a road crossing and hiked the extra 0.3 miles to a deli/convenience store and bought dinner.  No cooking again tonight!  It's almost 9 and I'm the only one at this site.  The rain brought cooler temps today, so that was nice.  Tomorrow I finish Virginia!

I stopped at the ATC on my way back to the trail to see who else had checked in.  There is so much history in Harpers Ferry and plaques everywhere, you could read for days. Back on the trail, I passed by Jefferson Rock which looks out over the junction of Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers. I passed the ruins of an Episcopal church, one of the first churches in Harper's Ferry.  Then I dropped down to river level, hiked past John Brown's stronghold, and crossed the Potomac on a bridge that hikers share with trains.I'm already done with West Virginia and into Maryland!  Five states done.The trail was good today. The first 3 miles in Maryland are along a canal-- wide and flat.  Then there was a climb of close to 1000 feet, followed by fairly flat ridge walk. I got to Gath State Park which has a archway memorial to war correspondents.  It started raining just before I got there, so I hid under an overhang and had lunch.  Moondrop, Doughnut, Bean and his friend showed up and then Quesadilla and Overdrive.  Ironman came in a few minutes later. Ironman and I hiked together the rest of the day.  This campsite has bathrooms with showers along with picnic tables-- so it is a particularly good site.  The whole lunch group is here, plus 3 other section hikers. I won't be hiking with this group long, as Quesadilla needs to pick up the pace.  She has vet school to get to in early August.

There was quite a bit of Indian Grass over much of the area, along with pines and aspens.The trail past the summit has been rerouted, so the top of the mountain can be restored.  The new trail went on the side of the mountain with good views of Palmerton and the old zinc mine plant. When we got to Low Gap Road, we hiked 1.3 miles to the Blue Mountain Diner.  We are camped out back but had dinner inside!I called Mechanical Man and arranged for us to slackpack tomorrow.  There is so little water in these sections that this plan makes the most sense for us.

Those Pennsylvania rocks took their toll on them. I then stopped by the post office and mailed some stuff to Ben's house in Boston that I can do without for a couple weeks.

As I was scoping out where the trail left the summit, I saw a bear grazing the blueberries.  I could just see its back and that the trail headed that direction.  I decided I should make my presence known, so I banged my poles together and the bear looked up, and stood up on it's back legs.  It was a beautiful, big bear!  We looked at each other for a while, then it dropped down and headed downhill.  I caught a glimpse of at least one cub following its momma! Later I took a 0.3 mile side trail to the Mohican Outdoor Center run by the AMC.  They serve food so I had a ruben, chips, a coke and ice cream sandwich.  A couple from England was there. They were at the church hostel last night, also.  Brewmaster and I met them a few days ago.I hiked until about 7.  I'm the only one at this site.  It had sprinkled earlier and the couple camped a couple miles sooner to make sure their tent was up in case the rain increased.

He also told me that he has permission from his job to take 2 more months off, so he's hiking to Mt Katahdin.  He also told me that Sparrow is here, but asleep.  It sounds like the same Sparrow I met, probably, 1200 miles ago.It is tough to say goodbye but it is nice to be back on Trail.

Just before I got to the store, a vehicle stopped and a young boy got out and handed me a  baggie of treats. They were from a local church whose youth group had interviewed hikers and put together bags of the most requested treats. I bought lunch and a few more resupply items and ate at a picnic table nearby.  It was a good break, and I sat out some of the warmest part of the day. Then it was back to the trail and uphill out of town.  There were a few steep, rocky spots but mostly just a steady climb.  About 4 miles into the climb I came to the Vermont border.  11 states done and 3 to go!  The last milestone came just before the cutoff to this shelter when I hit the 1600 mile mark!  Roughly 590 to go. Chris is here after doing a 5 mile day, testing out his ankle.  It's not 100 percent yet, so he may need to baby it for a few more days.  Fire Beast is here also.  He's a young guy from Germany who I first met in Virginia and last saw in Pennsylvania. Ben and Molly plan to summit Mt Katahdin with me, and that may be Labor Day weekend.  I figure I only need to average 11 miles per day to get there then.  That should work well, but the hardest hiking yet to come!

They weren't warm but were still tasty. Next I crossed under I-93 at Franconia Notch.  This was the start of a big climb from 1400 feet to 4200 feet.  I took a break part way up and 2 women with 2 boys paused to ask me if I was a thru-hiker.  Then one woman asked if I wanted some fruit!  She gave me an apple and a bag of peanut M&M's. Further up the climb I stopped at Liberty Springs Campsite to get some water from the spring.  I had thought about stopping there for the day, but it was only 1 o'clock so I hiked on.I finished the first climb to 4200 feet, then dropped 200, and then climbed to Franconia Ridge.  Franconia Ridge is a 5-6 mile stretch of trail above tree line.  It's not a level ridge-- there are lots of ups and downs. I first climbed to Little Haystack Mt at 4700 ft, then Mt Lincoln at 5000 ft, then Mt Lafayette at over 5200 ft.  This was the first time over 5000 ft since Mt Rogers in southern Virginia (remember that Tang!) The views were amazing.  I could see back south to Mt Moosilauke,  north to Mt Washington,  and over to Bondcliff which I hiked last year with Matt, Gaby, Ben, and Molly.The downhill off Mt Lafayette was tough, but eventually I got below tree line and found this spot.  It's not the most level spot, but I won't have any trouble sleeping!

There were just under 2 miles of smaller ups and downs before I started the climb up Mt Garfield.  When I finally got to the top, I was the only one there, and there were great views looking back at Franconia Ridge. The climb down Garfield was tough and slow.  At one point the trail and a stream were one and the same.  Most of the time I could find a dry boulder to step to-- but not always. I came to the part of the AT that Ben, Molly, Matt, Gaby and I hiked last summer-- the cutoff to 13 Falls Campsite, Galehead Hut, then up and over South Twin Mt. I stopped at Galehead Hut, ate several leftover pancakes, and bought a few more candy bars.  While getting ready to hike out, a woman handed me three bags of snacks.  She thru-hiked in 2015 and knew what I was in for. Thanks Pompom!After leaving the hut, I headed up South Twin, almost 1200 ft up in only 0.8 miles.  It was a rocky climb as well, and it took me an hour.  Again the views were amazing.  In one direction there were layers and layers of mountain peaks.After South Twin, the hiking was less hard. I hiked the 2 miles to the Bondcliff trail junction in just over an hour. I got to this campsite about 6.  A couple from Switzerland, who I've been seeing since mid-Vermont, are camping nearby.  They have a big dog and a big tent for the three of them, so it's harder to find stealth spots.
Tomorrow rain chances are back.  I've got 2 or 3 days until Mt Washington, and I'm hoping for good weather then.

First, though, I had some hiking to do.  The first 1.7 miles were mostly downhill to Zealand Falls Shelter.  I stopped in for breakfast leftovers-- that's a nice thing the huts do for hikers.  After the hut was some of the nicest trail anywhere.  Am I still in the Whites?  There were some nice views of the valley back to the hut and some rock cliffs.
I got to the road crossing and cleaned up the best I could, including putting on my less stinky shirt!  Then I went to the road and stuck out a thumb. Quite a few cars went by with no one stopping.  Then a car came from the other direction, turned into the lot, and waved me over.  Don and a friend had been day hiking, and they saw me when the friend was driving Don back to his car.  Don came back to get me!  He drove me the 40 minutes into North Conway and gave me a tour. We then went to his house where I got a shower, did laundry, and then I searched/called to get a motel room for the next two nights.  Don drove me to Wal-Mart to resupply, to the motel to check in, and then we ate dinner at a local brew pub.  Don also said he'd drive me back to the trail on Friday! Weather wise, it rained this evening, but I'm inside!  It's supposed to rain tomorrow.  I'll hike out Friday, so hopefully the rain is done by then!

You can drive up or take the cog railway along with hiking up.  The line to get a picture at the summit sign was crazy long.  I snuck up the backside and took a not very good selfie.  I did go to the snack bar and ate lunch.When I started down, the fog became less and less view-blocking, and eventually it was a beautiful clear day.  I had great views back to Mt Washington all afternoon as the trail stayed above tree line.I got to this hut about 5 and inquired about work for stay. Ali told me they already had all the hikers they could handle.

When I started hiking, I had the steep rocky climb up Mt Madison and then the equally steep rocky but much longer descent.  There were also strong winds up there-- probably 30 mph gusts.  All that made for slow hiking.  Eventually I dropped below tree line and was out of the wind where the trail wasn't quite as steep. I got to Pinkham Notch around 2.  There is a visitor center with a cafeteria, so I ate!  I then just hung out in their hiker room, charging my phone, resting, and sitting out some of the heat of the day. About 4, I set out to hike up the Wildcat Mountains.  I was only going 3 more miles, but they were tough miles.  It was steep, steep uphill for me.  I arrived at this location about 7:30, having averaged less than 1 mph. I'm camped near a ski gondola, and I have great views of Mt Washington.

We took a break at West Carry Pond and then hiked to this campsite on East Carry Pond.  I waded in the pond and washed my legs off-- there was a lot of muddy trail today.We ate dinner on the lake shore and listened to the loons call.  The weather was great today, the terrain was less hard.  We got to camp about 5:15, so we had time to relax. Thumper started in Harper's Ferry, and she hit the 1000 mile mark of her hike today.   Very cool!

Twofer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601071,"This was another beautiful day weather-wise, and the trail was good.We started hiking by 6:30.  The Kennebec River was 10 miles away, and the official path across the river is a canoe with a guy from the ATC.  The canoe operates from 9am to 2pm.We made good time and were at Pierce Pond at 10am with less than 4 miles to the river.  Crossing over the pond outlet was a little weird.  There was a wooden wall on the lake side with huge rocks on the outlet side with logs on the rocks.  We were crossing on the logs when Thumper stepped on something slick that threw her to the downstream side.  I thought she might save it a couple times, but she ended up in the outlet stream 3-4 feet below the walkway.  She hung on enough that only the bottom of her pack and herself from the waist down got wet.  I helped lift her pack as she climbed back up.  We got to dry ground and she wrung her socks out.  No major injury, so not much else to do but dry out as she hiked. Shortly after this excitement we came to a cutoff to an outdoor camp.  We had time, so we walked to it.  We talked to the owner for 15 minutes or so and had some coffee-- nice guy and interesting place.We got to the river just after noon, filled out our release forms, then waited for the guy to ferry two women across.  Thumper lounge in the middle while I helped paddle from the front.When we got to the far side, the guy drew us a map in the dirt to show us where everything is in Caratunk.  We headed for the Caratunk Inn to have their pulled pork sandwich and milkshake.  They had a nice little resupply shop there as well, so we bought enough to get to Monson in 3 days.  We were there close to 2 hours. Eventually we left and hiked 5.7 more miles to this shelter.  We're camped a little ways from the shelter.  Cheddar is here, too.   He's a young guy that hiked 27 miles today!  It's probably the last night we'll see him.Tomorrow, the forecast is for showers all day.  I hope they are wrong!

It was less than knee deep. We filtered water then set out to find a stealth camp.  We hiked probably 100 feet when we found a spot.  The rain had stopped which was nice for setting up camp and cooking dinner. Tomorrow I head to my last town-stop on this hike.  We plan to zero Friday before heading into the 100 mile wilderness and then Mt Katahdin!

I'm at Shaw's Hostel, and they serve an amazing breakfast--  eggs, bacon, hash browns, along with all you can eat blueberry pancakes. I got a little rest, but it seemed there was a lot to do. Thumper and I went to the ATC office to get the summitting rules.  I may have some complications.  There is a Native American gathering that weekend and all the day use passes are gone for Sept 1 & 2.  I bought one for Sept 3rd as a backup.  Basically to summit with Ben and Molly on Sept 2nd we'll have to wait in line and hope someone doesn't come use their pass. 
This hostel will bring us a food drop in the 100 mile wilderness, so we needed to figure out our miles and get that scheduled.  We'll carry 4 days of food leaving here and they'll bring us 3 days, that will keep pack weight down.We went out to eat and sat with a hiker I hadn't met before.  He started a week after me.I am sitting here writing this post when Poe walked in the room.  He and Savage got here today.  Nice to see some familiar faces.  He did tell me that Plod Along and Grandma Shorty are off the trail.  It's been a tough year to hike. Well it's time to sleep.   Tomorrow starts the last push!

We ate the awesome breakfast, got our food drop buckets filled and labeled, then caught the 8:30 shuttle back to the trail.  Poet, one of the hostel owners, drove us and gave us the overview of what's ahead on the trail.  Really good reminder for me.
The trail today had a lot of small ups and downs.  We hiked by several lakes/ponds and still haven't seen a moose.  We crossed several streams and were able to rock hop all but one of them. Big Wilson Stream, we had to wade.  It was flowing fast but wasn't over knee deep.  A section hiking father, Darth Vader, and son, Nasa, crossed right after us.  Darth Vader had been reading my journal.There was a cool waterfall at Little Wilson stream, dropping 60 feet.We got to camp just before 7, did all the normal camp chores, and finished eating by headlamp.  The days are getting shorter!

Twofer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601612,"Today was an interesting day, mostly from a people standpoint. 
We started with a climb up Chairback Mt.  There were dark clouds on the horizon, but they passed us by and soon the sun was shining.  Coming down off Chairback was a steep trail through a rock slide, slow going. Mid morning a guy passed us kind of jogging/hopping/fast walking down the trail.  He had a headlamp on and just a hydration pack.  A little while later we met two women who asked if we'd met Karel.  He's trying to break the record for the fastest supported hike of the entire AT.  We met his support team at a road crossing; he was already gone.  He's on day 40 and hopes to finish tomorrow.   He's averaged 52 miles per day so far!  More importantly his support team gave us some Snickers bars, cookies, and cheese puffs. Back to hiking, we had a stream to wade.  It was wide and less than knee deep; it felt great on the feet.  We took a lunch break by Gulf Hagas Stream.  There was a side trail that would take you to Maine's Grand Canyon and several day hikers were doing that hike.Later we met a young girl who had started in March, too.  She broke her elbow, was off seven weeks -- and now has passed me.  When she told me her trail name was Eleven, it came back to me that I was in Glasgow, VA, and she was heading there when she fell.  Several of her friends were in Glasgow and told me about it. The last part of today's hike was up to Gulf Hagas Mt, and then it was fairly flat to this campsite.  We got here at 4:30, so we got the best spots!  We set up camp, got water, then built a fire. Several new hikers here tonight, Boomerang, Meltdown, Bean, and Sweatline.  Savage and Poe showed up after dark but had just seen a mother moose and baby up close.

The climb down wasn't too bad.  It was steep but hikeable-- not rock climbing.  We ate lunch at a shelter part way down.  Josh and Tang (sorry Drew there's another Tang out here!) were there when we arrived.  Two SOBO'S stopped also, then Savage and Poe got there before we left.We're camped by this pond, arriving about 4:15.  We set up tents, then walked 0.2 miles to a spring to get better water than pond water.  I cooked and ate the two dinners I had left (food drop tomorrow for last 3 days). It started to rain, and we headed for our tents about 6:45.The terrain from here to Katahdin is fairly flat, so we plan to do some bigger miles the next few days.

We got to the road and had 40 minutes to wait.  Shaw's showed up right at 9, and we reloaded our food bags for the next 3 days. They also brought each of us a cold beer.  We thought about having it at camp tonight but it wouldn't be cold, so we drank it there. The terrain the rest of the day was great.  We took several breaks and still got to camp about 3:30.  We hiked by several lakes and Cooper Brook with cascading waterfalls.We're at Antlers Campsite which is out on a peninsula, so we have water on three sides.  It's a beautiful spot.  I waded in and took a bandana bath.  Again tonight right after dinner, a storm blew in. This one dumped rain and had some thunder and lightning.  I stayed mostly dry with some splashes caming up under the rain fly.  Thumper ended up in a puddle, and the water came through the floor of her tent.  She got out and found a dryer spot to move her tent to, but Darth Vader and Nasa had checked radar and another band was coming.  Thumper was nervous about sitting in a tent in standing water in a lightning storm, so she came and sat in my tent until round 2 passed.  She apologized for crowding me, and I told her this was nothing.  I got to tell about the time I slept sitting on a 5 gallon bucket at the river bank while keeping the fire going and tucking the plastic around my snoring Dad and brother!The rain stopped, and I helped her move her tent to higher ground. She dried it out the best she could.  These are the nights that aren't much fun but make a great story later!It's still only 9:30 so hopefully I'll get good night's sleep.  Three more days of hiking and then summit day (the AT ends at the top of My Katahdin).

Twofer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602415,"It's been 5 days since I finished the trail so this is as update on what I've been up to.
On Monday we woke up in Milliknocit and went to the AT Cafe for breakfast. Thumper joined us there. Julie bought me three new AT tee shirts and a coffee mug. I signed the 2018 hiker ceiling tile which will be displayed in the ceiling. I asked about where the 2007 signatures were and back then we signed a wooden door that was right behind the ceiling tile that I just signed. Molly finally spotted ""Twofer"" and it ended up being just above the 2018 ceiling tile that was leaning against it. Later Ben looked at the photo he took of my 2018 signing and the 2007 signing was in the same picture!
We checked out of the motel, picked up Thumper and headed out. We gave Thumper a ride to Bangor to pick up a rental car. She planned to visit some friends as she headed to her Dad's house in Connecticut. After we dropped her off we drove to Acadia National Park for a quick tour before heading back to Boston.
Tuesday I aired all my gear out, washed my hiking clothes then loaded the pack back up and put it in a duffel for checking baggage on our flight home. I managed to squeeze a nap into my ""busy"" day!
Wednesday was another lazy day. Ben and Molly were working so we hung out with their dog Chloe all day. I did get outside and did a little yard work. We also got organized for flying home the next day. The four of us went out to dinner before calling it a night.
Thursday we flew back to Iowa. We got to Des Moines before noon and met my parents, my older sister and my brother for lunch. It was great to see everyone for the first time in 7 months! Finally we drove home, unloaded the car and found the couch! 
Today I got my haircut and beard trimmed up a bit, so I don't look quite as much like a homeless person!

I'll try to do a better comparison of my two AT hikes in a few days but here's some quick thoughts. My pace was very similar for most of the hike. I think I slowed down some this trip in New Hampshire and southern Maine. That is the toughest hiking and it felt tougher this time, maybe because I'm 11 years older, or maybe because the weather was worse (let's go with the latter)! The weather was definetly worse this hike than the first. I had more cold weather, more rain and a whole lot more days above 90 deg. I remember thinking on my first hike ""I wonder how I'd handle a bad weather year?""  There are many things that can take a person off the trail, and I feel very lucky and blessed to have finished both hikes.
