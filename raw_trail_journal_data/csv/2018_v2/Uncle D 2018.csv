Uncle D 2018,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583824,"Well... Here I am about ready to start another AT thru-hike. I did not expect to do it again but the opportunity came along to do it with my friend, Griff (Old Guy), and so here I am! He flew in to Atlanta from Texas and rented a car to go the final leg to Amicalola Falls (North Georgia).  And I did a one way car rental from Sarasota to Amicalola. It’s funny, we both went long distances but arrived within minutes of each other.","At Home

Uncle D 2018,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583826,"Today, our final day before our AT hike tomorrow, we spent on final preparations. This afternoon we met the other half of our party, Colin and David, whom will be doing a thru-hike as well. This will be quite a different dynamic considering I did my first thru-hike alone. We expect cold and rain our first couple of days. Oh well...might as well jump right in!","

Uncle D 2018,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584002,"Today’s the day! Griff and I got up about 5:30 in order to get breakfast and be ready for our shuttle we hired to get us to the trail head. We were meeting several other hikers who would be going along with us. There is D Square (David), Crazy Brit (Colin), Helo (helicopter pilot), Jay, Blue, Griff and I. I did my first AT thru/hike alone. It will be interesting to see how this “plays out”.
The forecast was rain and cold and it didn’t disappoint. Even though the weather was crappy it felt good to be back in the woods.  Even in the rain the mountains are beautiful. The group soon spread out as we all have our own pace. Our goal for the day was 14 miles to a camp site. I really didn’t know if I could make that considering I only made 8 miles to Hawks Shelter on my previous 2015 hike. 
Surprisingly I made it although pretty tired. Everyone came in over the next hour or so except my hiking buddy Griff.  It would be dark soon and without cell service I really started to be concerned. As tired as I was I began hiking back down the trail. Without a pack I could hike very fast which I needed to do to avoid being caught out in the dark. I hiked 2 to 3 miles and miraculously I regained cell service on a mountain summit. There was a text there from Griff and he said; he had taken a bad fall while crossing a log  which spanned a stream. He had badly injured his back but had made it to Hawks Shelter another 6 miles from me at this time. He said, he would work his way down the mountain and he needed to get to a doctor. He said don’t come back for him that he would be ok. Oh Shit!  Here I was still an impossible distance from him in fading light and my extreme fatigue and still miles from my camp where food, warmth and shelter was. It was good to know where Griff was and I must trust him to be capable of getting out.  I knew he was among other hikers at the shelter and would certainly get the help he needed from them. Hikers are like that. I tried to contact him but I got no response. I turned and hiked as fast as I could since the light was almost gone and I had a long way to go. When I returned, Colin made me the best cup of coffee I ever had. I explained to the guys Griff’s misfortune. 
As I fixed myself a hot meal in my little tent it was so sad to think about Griff’s bad luck. I really need some rest.","Springer Mountain, GA

Uncle D 2018,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584004,"It rained most of the night but luckily it stopped when it was time to get up and hike. It’s always difficult to put on cold wet pants and socks in the mornings. I still was concerned about how Griff was making out. He was only 8 miles away but he might as well been a thousand miles away. 
Everyone was pretty tired from our long hike yesterday (long for the first day) so we decided to make a shorter day of it...only 10 miles.  It rained intermittently throughout the day. The highlight of the day was getting cell service on a mountain summit and hearing from Griff.  He was down off the mountain and had gotten to the ER. Nothing was broken but he had deep tissue bruises. He will be back on the trail after required rest. Thank goodness :) 
Our campsite is right on a stream. I look forward to some good sleep tonight. Nasty weather is coming.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Uncle D 2018,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584005,Last night was so cold.  But I was snug in my 0 degree sleeping bag.  Some of the others were very cold and unfortunately Colin’s tent collapsed in the high winds. This caused his gear to get really wet in the hard pour.  Even David’s gear got wet due to a leaky tent. Today’s hike was really cold with gale force winds.  Visibility was limited for most of the day. Even the water in my water bottle started to freeze. The rain of course had turned to snow and sleet and grew worse as we climbed Blood Mountain.  This was the most difficult climb to date.  The summit has a stone shelter but I only stayed there for a few minutes...my feet and hands were numb and I was anxious to get down in the gap where it would be warmer. Our destination was Neel Gap. We are checked into a small cabin (Blood Mountain Cabins) where hot showers and pizza saved the day.  Tomorrow will be even colder but there shouldn’t be any snow.  Are we having fun yet! Ha!,"Lance Creek

Uncle D 2018,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584072,"Well...we started in the dark in snow flurries. But it stopped early. Everything is frozen solid.  Rocks are covered in ice which makes hiking very tough. We we’re all so very cold. The highlight of the day was coming down off the mountain and finding “trail magic” at a road crossing. I couldn’t believe those guys were set up in the freezing temperatures and wind. What a treat. Hot coffee and pastries and chocolate.  They even had chairs for us with their van blocking the wind. The rest of the day was just hard, cold hiking. We hiked about 14.5 miles but had to tent near a mountaintop which was the only suitable place to stop unfortunately. The temps should go down to the teens tonight.","Blood Mountain

Uncle D 2018,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584228,"We started in the dark, this morning. That seems to be David’s preference. Start early, quit early. I personally prefer to hike during daylight. Less chance of losing the trail. We summited several tough mountains today. There was, Blue Mountain (4,000), Rocky Mountain (also 4,000) and Tray Mountain (4,500). These were all long, hard climbs. We are really suffering since we don’t have our “hiker legs” yet. We camped near Tray Mountain Shelter...big mistake! Probably the coldest night of our lives. I’m sure it must of hit single digits at that altitude and of course the wind was howling around us. And my tent does not stop wind.  I have a zero degree sleeping bag and I had to put on every piece of clothing I had...even my rain jacket. We could hardly wait for morning to come. Hiking helps warm you up. Brrr....Only 2,132 miles to go.","Sheep Rock Top

Uncle D 2018,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584229,"It was hard to regulate our clothes to remain somewhat comfortable today. Near the summits the cold and wind would freeze you but down in the valleys you would sweat...almost overheating. It was just more long hard climbs today. The good news was our destination is “Top of Georgia” hostel. Good food, a shower, clean clothes and a nice comfy mattress. It’s a typical hostel with rooms full of bunk beds. We got a shuttle into town for some Mexican food and resupplied at “Ingles” for the next leg. The weather report says tomorrow it should finally warm up. Only 2,122 miles to go.","Tray Mountain

Uncle D 2018,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584326,"Well ...the hostel stay didn’t work for me. The shower, clean clothes and good food was good, but. The snoring was so loud that i virtually got no sleep. It was a long, long night. And on top of that, we had our toughest hike to date today on no sleep. We left Georgia and entered North Carolina this afternoon. It seemed like the mountains immediately got so much steeper. The climb up Couthouse Bald was brutal! We did a little over 12 miles, shorter than previous days but so much tougher. It was nice though hiking into another state. We found a nice little remote campsite with water at a place called Whitehall Stamp...must be something Southern.Tomorrow will be tough because there never is enough time for the body to recover before the next days beating begins. Whew! I need a day off.

Uncle D 2018,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584481,"Last nights camp worked out pretty good. I finally got more than a couple hours sleep. I don’t know why I can’t sleep. You would think as tired as I am after consecutive hard days of hiking I would practically pass out but I don’t. It started raining again just as we were getting out of our bunks. We started hiking in cold rain. It’s impossible to dress in a way that is comfortable since the front of you as you hike is freezing and your back is sweating and overheating. Of course when you stop your sweat starts to evaporate and you get really chilled. 
Luckily it cleared up around noon time and I was able to take off a couple layers. It turned out to be a nice day. We hiked over Standing Indian Mountain. We did almost 16 miles...too much considering we don’t have our “hiker legs but we were trying to make it into Franklin by the end of the next day. Colin has an app on his phone which counts the steps we take, the equivalent of how many flights of stairs we climb in a day and distance in miles. A typical day can be; 35,000 steps and more than 300 flights of stairs...that’s a lot considering hiking in mud and rain and 30 pounds on your back. We stopped in a little secluded camp site called Betty Creek Gap...a little muddy but not bad. (About the picture... it is amazing what you find along the trail)
Only 2,094 miles to go.","Whitehall Stamp

Uncle D 2018,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584482,"During the night last night we experienced a severe thunder storm. The storm moved right over the top of us as the lightning and the thunder starting hitting simultaneously. Laying there in our little tents it was a little nerve racking...mostly worrying about a tree being struck and falling on you. We were up and off before daylight, as usual, making good time. 
We had one really tough climb of the day, Albert Mountain. It was extremely steep, perhaps the most vertical yet. When we reached the top we had hit the 100 mile mark. Not too bad considering. The view from there was spectacular. This is why we do this. We made it to the road crossing into Franklin by 1:30. We hitched into Franklin and stopped at the “Lazy Hiker”, a bar in town.
It was no problem getting a table because as bad as we smelled people gave us plenty of room :) 
We’ll be staying at Jay’s house tonight where his gracious wife is fixing us a gourmet meal. They are so nice to feed us and let us stay in their beautiful home in the mountains. We will be taking tomorrow off to rest up. Boy do we need that.

Uncle D 2018,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584964,"Between extreme cold, wind and rain or snow, we took three days off while staying at David’s House. It’s unbelievable how gracious and accommodating David and Barbara have been. They have a very nice home on the mountain behind the Nantahala Outdoor Center. Colin has been having a really hard time with shin splints which requires much rest. We intended to do 4 sections of the trail based from David’s house. Tomorrow we start the first of four minus Colin.","Slack Packing

Uncle D 2018,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584963,"I was a little worried about getting back on the trail myself because my left knee has slowly starting to give me trouble. I had a new pair of inserts in my shoes as well as a soft knee brace in place to see if that might help. Barbara dropped David, Blue and I at the trail head about 8:30 in the morning. It was 21 degrees and the snow was deep. This won’t be easy over the many steep, slippery and icy descents of the day. It was hard to make good time. We had about 13 miles to hike. It was actually a beautiful hike with the clear blue sky’s and the sun shining through the ice formations as we hiked. However I began to get very distracted by the fact that my knee was definitely not getting better. I had to favor it more and more as the pain became more intolerable. Wow this was becoming painful! What is wrong with my knee? In fact the right knee was starting the same thing only to a lesser extent, probably due to favoring. It turned out to be a very long day. I never stopped...not even to eat my lunch. All I could think about was getting off that mountain and off my feet! After about 7 hours of continuous hiking I finally reached my destination. David suggested I go to the walk-in clinic and have it checked out. The nurse assumed it was inflammation, gave me a shot and prescribed extra strong “ibuprofen like” pills. Not sure at this point if that’s correct. I’ll take a couple more days off to rest up and see what happens. Sheesh! I hate not being a kid anymore (physically).Picture left to right.

Uncle D 2018,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585131,"My knee is definitely injured in some way. After two more days of rest, it is only worse. We decided to go to the nearby town of Sylva and go to the emergency room there for a MRI and find out exactly what’s wrong with my knee. We tried several ways to get some sort of treatment but only met with bureaucratic obstacles and promises of lengthy wait times to get any type of service. We finally gave up and went to a local craft beer brewery, sampling its goods, eating french fries and playing darts. It seems the fastest way to get this knee problem “looked at” is going to be, traveling back to Florida where I have some connections. Ugh!! I hate all these issues!! Dang it! David and Colin are going to get back on the trail without me. Now that Colin has gotten over his shin issues they are ready to go. I will have to jump up and meet them down the trail once I have my issues sorted out. I’ll just have to come back at the end of the hike and complete what I have missed. I called my Doctor and made an appointment for the following Monday.“Blue” had always planned on getting off the trail at this point and has offered to drive me back to Bradenton. He has a relative nearby that he wants to visit. That should work. Gosh I hope this doesn’t take too long. We hit the road tomorrow morning.","Nantahala Outdoor Center area

Uncle D 2018,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585912,I made my appointment at the Doc on Monday. He seemed to think there were no tears apparently. I had a MRI scheduled for later in the day. With all this rest my knee is definitely improving. By Wednesday I still hadn’t received the MRI report so I reserved a one-way rental car to drive to Erwin Tennessee to meet up with Colin and David. I’m tired of waiting around. I guess hiking will tell the story. I’ll meet them at “Uncle Johnny’s” once they come out of the woods in Erwin on Friday afternoon. It’s going to be great to get back on the trail again. Snow is in the forecast for Saturday. Who ever thought being so miserable could be so much fun! Ha!,"Irwin, TN

Uncle D 2018,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586035,I got the worst news I could of received yesterday from the doctor. I was nearly to my destination to meet the guys in Erwin Tennessee when my cell phone rang. It was my Doc. He had received the MRI report (finally) and wanted to let me know what they found out about my problem knee. I have a torn meniscus and a stress fracture on my left knee. I really never expected that at all. I guess that explains the severe pain I had on my last hike. This is so disturbing. It was such a shock it felt like someone had just kicked me in the stomach. The thought of my friends hiking off without me was almost too much to accept. I did some research and it seems the fracture is the most troublesome part. It normally takes 6 to 8 weeks to heal so I am holding out hope that I can possibly meet them up the trail somewhere North of Harpers Ferry. It will kill me if I can’t get back on the trail. Please keep your fingers crossed. Tomorrow I start a form of re-hab that promotes healing (a routine I learned about on the internet).,"Irwin, TN

Uncle D 2018,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593369,"June 4 (Monday) Well... it’s time to pick this journal up again. I actually started hiking again about two weeks ago. The guys (Colin & David) met up with me in Blowing Rock NC. We planned on meeting there so we could go to “Trail Days” in Damascus VA which we did. We left there on May 21st to head back to the trail. My knee has been healing for about 7 weeks. It feels pretty good so it’s time to test it out! The guys did about 500 miles while my knee was healing. We started at the James River bridge at mile marker 786 near Buena Vista, VA. I was experiencing more than a little trepidation. I really wanted to continue this hike. Starting May 22nd I hiked about a week, starting slow (thanks guys), and experienced very little pain...yeah! The trouble was...on Friday May 25th a got a text from my brother that my Mom had fallen and broken her hip! She was going in the next day for surgery and getting a complete new titanium hip installed! My poor Mom! The word was, she was really having a tough time of it. After agonizing over what to do I decided to head back to Florida. After only a week of hiking I was on a plane heading back to Bradenton. I set up a return flight one week later to re-rejoin the guys on the trail...if mom’s condition allowed it. Well here I am...back on a plane...going North to Charlottesville, VA where I’ll rent a car (one way) to drive to Front Royal, VA to rendezvous with the boys. I’ll be hiking tomorrow. I think we will make Harpers Ferry, WV by the end of the day. Whew! This here has shore been a roller coaster durn yee!","
