ncwild,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604426,"On August 21st 2018, I ventured down to Northern Georgia to hike the Amicalola Falls Trail as well as the Appalachian Trail Approach Trail & Appalachian Trail.  After a five hour drive from North Carolina I arrived at Amicalola Falls State Park Visitor Center and the beginning of the Approach Trail.  The ranger was nice enough not to charge me the $5 fee for parking there, in order to hike up to the top of the falls.  My plan was to do the Approach Trail, which I assumed followed the stream up to the top of the falls.  Apparently, after observing the park map, I took the wrong trail ?  According to the park service PDF map, the Approach Trail leads well away from the stream and ends up at the top of the falls avoiding the infamous ""steps"".  The trail that I took followed the stream and included the ""steps"" and was called ""Top of the Falls"" trail.  Not a very good beginning for someone aspiring to thru hike Appalachian Trail !!  So I called Amicalola Falls State Park to clear this up.  According to the park official, when you go through the famous arch behind the visitor center, you are on the Approach Trail.  You hike a short distance to a fork, where the ""East Ridge Trail"" leads off to the right and the ""Top of the Falls"" trail continues on left or straight, following the stream and paralleling the paved road.  On the park service map this East Ridge Trail is labeled as the Approach Trail.  According to the official with the park, the ""adopted"" Approach Trail is the trail that indeed follows the stream and goes up via the infamous steps.  So I asked the official what the actual signage stated on the ground, thinking that I missed the turn for the Approach Trail.  She stated that the physical signage for the trail to the right says, ""East Ridge Trail"", and does not say ""Approach Trail"" like it does on the map.  She says that the ""Top of the Falls"" trail was adopted as the Approach Trail because that is what most thru hikers use when starting their hike.  She also stated that the East Ridge Trail is much steeper than the adopted Approach Trail, if you can believe that !!  Confused yet ?  So, as it turns out, I did not miss a turn, and was correct in taking the ""Top of the Falls"" trail, even though the map indicates otherwise.  Anyway, onto the hike up to the top of the falls.  I'm glad I did this without my pack, because this one mile stretch from the visitor center to the top of the falls was a lung buster.  It took me about 40 minutes at a moderate pace, including stopping for photos and short rest breaks.  The falls were truly amazing and it was well worth the difficult hike.  The hike back to the visitor center was, of course, much easier and I did the return trip in about 20 minutes.  I spent the night at Amicalola Lodge and was looking forward to getting on the trail the next morning.",,View Entry,"Aug 21, Tue",0
ncwild,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604381,"Started out this day from the top of Amicalola Falls, after being shuttled by Ron Brown Shuttle Services from Woody Gap, where I left my vehicle.  If anyone ever needs a shuttle in Northern Georgia, Ron Brown is the guy.  He provided me with a wealth of information on the ride from Woody Gap back to Amicalola Falls, most importantly advising me about there being no water on a six mile stretch from Hawk Mountain to Cooper Gap.  At around 8am with temperatures in the 70's and high humidity, I started walking.  My pack weight was around 25 lbs, including carrying a liter of water, which I thought was pretty good.  Not before long the trail started going up, sometimes very steep, with very few switchbacks.  The heat and humidity made the difficult terrain that much harder.  At about two miles I met two guys camped in a site to the right of the trail, in two separate tents.  They commented on how difficult the trail had been to which I concurred.  I asked how much weight they were carrying, and to my astonishment, they stated about 60 lbs. each !!  Anyway, I plowed on, sweat rolling off of me.  I reached Springer Mountain, the Southern Terminus and official start of the Appalachian Trail, around noon, after 7.8 grueling miles.  There was a couple day hiking there along with another hiker, who had previously thru hiked (flip flopped) the trail.  After a short water/snack break and some photos, myself and the thru hiker, trail name ""GO"", proceeded north on the trail.  ""GO"" was also on a day hike and was training for a PCT thru hike he was planning to do in April of 2019.  We chatted about the trail and other things, and I was asking him all kinds of questions about his thru hike the previous year, as this is something I have always wanted to do.  We reached Stover Creek shelter where ""GO"" and I parted company.  He was going to take a break there and then head back to Amicalola, which I believe would come close to an 20 mile day !!  It was nice to have had someone else to hike and chat with and I wished him luck on his PCT attempt.  For the next several miles the trail continued to be very difficult.  My goal for the day was to reach Hawk Mountain shelter and call it a day.  That would be 15.9 hard miles total.  I reached Hawk Mountain shelter side trail around 3pm, dropped my pack and hiked down the side trail to the shelter where there was supposed to be a water source.  There were about five to seven college aged guys at the shelter and they appeared to be in the same group.  I decided to go back to where I had left my pack and get water at a location that I had passed about 1/4 mile previously.  The water source crossed right over the Appalachian Trail, coming from an area upstream that looked good, so I did not bother to filter.  After filling up about two liters of water, I headed back and made camp about 10 yards off of the AT and about 30 yards from the shelter side trail in a dry flat area.  I usually like to ""stealth camp"", well away from any trails, but this appeared to be the only good area around.  After getting my REI Quarter Dome T2 Plus up, sleeping bag and full length Therm-A-Rest NeoAir unpacked, it was time for dinner.  I fired up the Snow Peak Giga Power and had two cups of boiling water going in less than three minutes, for some Nissin Top Ramen (no MSG) soup.  After wolfing this down, I cooked up a Mountain House Chili Mac and ate this out of the pouch.  There was still about an hour plus of daylight left, so I just crawled into the tent and laid down, thinking about the day's hike.  The day's hike was, to say the least, exhausting.  I believe that I should have probably cut the mileage in half, making it a three day hike, and carried much less weight.  My tent weighed 5 lbs. plus, my sleeping bag was a 3lb winter bag, and I was carrying too much food and clothing.  This, along with the heat and humidity had made for a very difficult day.  Around 11pm that night, I heard a helicopter hovering about a half mile away and then heard it land.  A short time later was the sound of automatic weapons fire.  This went on for about a half hour.  I was aware of the Army Ranger training facility in the area and had heard that you would hear this on occasion.  I was not sleeping anyway.  The gunfire started up again at 3am and lasted for about as long.  Have you ever been so tired that you can't sleep ?","Amicalola Falls
