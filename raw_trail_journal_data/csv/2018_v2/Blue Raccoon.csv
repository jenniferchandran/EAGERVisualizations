Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583898,"Yikes, only 18 days until my big hike begins!  I’m super excited, but I would be lying if I said I wasn’t a little nervous too.  
Trailjournals.com requires that I make 3 entries before my journal becomes available for public view.  There’s definitely a learning curve here, so I’m sure I’ll need all three entries before I feel comfortable using this journaling format. 
The struggle is real, but I’m here to talk about the A.T.(Appalachian Trail).  The A.T. is approximately 2190 miles long. Actual distance fluctuates because the trail gets detoured or rerouted from time to time.  This is usually due to forest fires, but can be almost anything from natural disasters to increased bear activity.  Yep, I said Bear!  
The A.T. runs through 14 states from Georgia to Maine.  A few hikers choose the opposite path from Maine to Georgia.  As for me, I’m a NOBO (northbounder) from Georgia to Maine.  Hikers going the other way are called SOBO (southbounder).   I’m hoping to cross paths with some SOBO’s along the way and get their perspective from hiking the opposite way.    
A through hiker is someone who hikes the entire trail in one season.  This is my goal!   I’m hoping to earn the title of  NOBO Through Hiker 2018.  There are no rules to this except you must walk every inch of the trail in your season.  So when I come down to re-stock I must go back up where I came down.  I’ve got 2 planned trips off the mountain during my 6 months out there.  Each will be for a few days off the trail.  The same rule applies… I must go up where I came down.  And of course timing is important.  I cannot take too much time off the trail or I won’t get to finish in my season.  I know there is a cut-off date to summit Mt. Katahdin in Maine, and  I’ve got to summit Katahdin! 
Back to my nerves…in 2016 there were 3,337 hikers who attempted to through hike the A.T.  685 of those hikers actually made it.  That’s around a 20% success rate.  More than half of the hikers who attempt a through hike are in their 20’s, but the rest fill up the ranks 30’s,40’s, 50’s, and older.  I’ve personally noted in my readings that middle aged women rarely make it.  As a matter of fact not one of the middle aged women I’ve followed have ever made it.  I’ll turn 54 years old on the trail, the odds are stacked against me…but I’m not a quitter.  
Why do hikers drop off?  Lots of reasons.  Often times it’s due to sickness or injury, and on a rare occasion death. Most times they just give up. It’s not in them to go the long haul. Sometimes they get what they came for without going the distance.  All I know for sure is that I’m not a quitter!  As my daughter Kayla says “if mom comes off the trail early it’ll be on a stretcher”!  She’s probably right.  None the less,  all of these little tidbits of information gets my nerves going just a little.  
Well I guess this is enough to be a decent first entry in my journal.  I’ll talk about the common illnesses and my trail name over the next two mandatory entries.  The hiker world is very interesting, so I’ve got lots to share. 
So long for now from Paducah Kentucky,  where I’m visiting my kids and grands one last time before I set out on the adventure of a lifetime.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583955,"The countdown continues!  
We are still in Paducah visiting the kids and grands.   It has started to snow!  I’m going to try to upload a photo of the snow with this post.  It’s just a photo taken from our hotel, but I’ve got to learn how this website works.  Technology is not my strong suit.  
I previously mentioned illnesses on the trail. There are three main concerns. West Nile Virus is one of them.  This is a viral illness given to humans via mosquito bites.  The only real protection is to use insect repellent, wear loose clothing, and prayer.  The symptoms are usually fever, headache, vomiting or rash.   Often times someone has it and don’t even know, but sometimes it becomes serious and requires medical intervention.  The second concern is Giardiasis.  This is an intestinal infection you get from drinking contaminated water.  I’m using a Sawyer Squeeze which helps filter out the water that I’ll be drinking.   The Sawyer Squeeze is my frontline protection against Giardiasis. I’m also fortunate enough to have a physician willing to work with me on this hike. Because of her, I will have antibiotics if needed along the way.  Lastly there is a concern for Lyme Disease.  Lyme Disease is given to  us compliments of Deer Ticks.   I’ll be using Permethrin treated clothing to help keep them away and I’ll be sleeping in a permethrin treated tent.  However, ticks will still be a problem and I’ll be checking myself every evening.  Once again my doctor is great! I’ll have treatment if I see a bullseye around a tick bite.  A bullseye is a sign of Lyme disease.  
My only other concerns are bears, broken bones, hypothermia, or heat stroke… did I mention BEARS?!?
So let’s talk about trail names.   Most through hikers have a hiking name they use while on the trail.  Mine is “Blue Raccoon”.  Some hikers choose their own name and others acquire a name while on the trail.   I chose my name.  My dad’s favorite coon hound was named Blue, and somehow I turned that memory into the trail name “Blue Raccoon”.  My little cousin even created a logo for me of a raccoon hiking with blue boots.  Preparing for this adventure has been a lot of fun!
So many folks have asked me why am I doing this.  In the beginning it was for one reason only, but over time it’s become multiple reasons, and the list keeps growing.  What do I expect to gain from this? That’s a good question too.  I’ll try to address both of these in my next journal entry.  For now, I think this is a good place to stop for entry #2.  I’m going to do my best to attach a photo.  I think I’ll make it of my grandkids in the hotel pool instead of the snowfall. I hope it’s there!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584050,"fifteen days and counting!  The pressure is on!  I have so much to do in 15 days including: going back to Florida with my daughter and granddaughter who will be visiting for a few days, then a visit from my son and his girlfriend for a few days, four 12 hour shifts at the hospital, getting all of our bills in order for the hubby to manage, and make sure my backpack is right.  Whew!  It’s a lot! I think I just had my freak out moment. 
Okay, it’s time for me to tell you why I’m doing this.  The idea started as something unique I wanted to do in honor/memory of my dad.  I would say that I was a daddy’s girl.  He was a hunter, an athlete, and just an overall good human being. Excellent father!  I spent many Illinois winter  nights in the woods with him coon hunting. He taught me about survival, keeping a level head in moments of chaos, and respect for nature.  He didn’t spend a lot of time in the mountains, but he loved them.  He would always say “this is God’s country sis”.  Dad was not a religious man, but he was definitely right with God.  
The idea of me hiking the A.T. Was born about 2.5 years ago during a time in my life when I was in the worst physical condition I have ever been in.  I was just coming back from a surgery. My body had gone soft, falling apart literally.  So I started walking as soon as the doc gave me a green light. Dad crossed my mind a lot during these walks.  He was an adventurer.  He and I had talked about going to a dude ranch just before he got sick and died.  I knew if he were here, he would have taken these walks with me.  I thought he would have  even walked the A.T. with me... and so it began. I started doing research. Eventually I began taking day hikes. All the while I was remembering, reliving, my love for the outdoors and nature.  This has been the most therapeutic process for my soul, with bonus physical benefits. I still have horrible joint pains that I’m sure will never go away.  I’ve had surgery on both knees, my left acromiolclavicular joint has been cut out, discs removed in my low back and replaced with synthetic discs then rods, screws, and bone grafting.  I’ve had to take time off from work betweeen these surgeries, but somehow I’ve managed to be a trauma nurse through it all. In some pretty busy ER’s too. I’m not a quitter.  I know if I don’t use it, I’ll lose it.  I’m hoping this is the first and last time you ever hear from me that I’m in pain.  I am in pain all the time, but pain does not dictate my life. 
Once again the question comes WHY am I hiking the A.T.?  The obvious answer is to honor my father, and it did start out that way, but boy oh boy the WHY’s have grown!  Dad is always front and center, but my husband has jumped on board.  He started hiking with me.  We’ve hiked Springer together, we’ve hiked up to 9850 ft elevation in the Rockies, and we’ve enjoyed some awesome meanderings in the cascades.  We’ve also hiked a bit of the Appalachians in New York along with our grandson CJ.  Papa Big Swig (aka my hubby) has become my biggest cheerleader, organizer, and overall supporter for this adventure.  Without him, nothing about this hike would be happening.  So I’m also hiking for my hubs who is doing all he can to make this a success for me.  I don’t want to let him down.
Now for the crazy part of it...I need to get away from the world.  I’m having difficulty living in this computerized generation.  Electronics are great when they work.  Mine seem to have issues every day.  I know they are a must in todays world so I do it, but I don’t want to.  I miss dialing a phone from home only. I carry my cell phone with me, I’m always available, but I don’t want to be.  I miss having 3 channels only, and  PBS.  I’ve actually completely given up TV.  TV was a significant contributor to me going soft!  I don’t even own one anymore.  One day I said to my husband “here we sit watching others live and not living our own lives”.  I cannot imagine the hours that probably add up to years wasting my own life watching others live theirs. It took him a bit to let go, but now we have no televisions in our home.  I guess I could say my brain needs a rest.  Time to hear God, be mesmerized by a babbling brook, challenged in ways that are a joy to face and overcome.  You techie’s can call it a re-boot!(Giggling just a little). 
Lastly, I’m looking for inspiration.  Inspiration to write a book.  I’ve had the pleasure of meeting someone who’s story needs told.  She sings like a bird!  It’s time to get her out of the cage, and watch her spread her wings to fly! She will not be the focus of my journal, it’s all about my hike, but stay tuned for more info on the book.  You will love her!  
I was pleasantly surprised to see that someone has already started reading my journal!  I know I won’t always be able to do this, but thanks for your kind words of encouragement!  You have no idea what it means to see “Connie” as my first follower.  I don’t think this was a coincidence, and I hope you enjoy my hike.  
What do I think I’ll get out of my hike?  Hopefully a renewed sense of wellbeing!  In the medical world we calll it homeostasis.  I need homeostasis of my body, mind, and soul.  
And of course I’m hoping for some wicked bragging rights!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584863,"Papa Big Swig and I loaded up the SUV to start driving toward Amicalola Falls state Park today. We have planned two nights and three days to get there.  Slow and steady completes the hike!  
A new REI has opened up here in Florida so we stopped there to get a few final things on my list. I went ahead and bought hiking sandals.(because I’m feeling confident that I will still be on the trail come summer) They are Keen’s.  I have found Keen brand  hiking shoes or boots to be the best for my feet.  So far, I haven’t lost any toenails since I switched to Keens. However, this hike will be the ultimate challenge for toenail loss! I also picked up a thin puffy jacket (REI brand) on clearance.  Broke down and bought two Mountain House meals. I’ll see if my own dehydrated meals come close to them. At my hubby’s insistence I grabbed a snake bite kit. And since I’m feeling confident,a pair of Kuhl brand hiking  shorts. They are the first hiking shorts made for women that I’ve found with decent sized cargo pockets. Hubs picked up a hoodie for himself. Abracadabra, just like that we made $285 disappear!   
We’re pulling the camper behind us, so tonight we are just sleeping at a rest stop. Tomorrow we’ll stop in Cartersville Ga for an overnight stay with the sisters-in-law, then check in at Amicalola Falls as early as possible on Monday.  We’ll stay in the camper there until I start my hike on Wednesday.  
Can you believe I’m just a few days away? I have planned, studied, and trained, for 2.5 years to get here, and at this very moment, I’m feeling calm. I know it could be a false sense of security, but I think I’m ready!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585082,"We arrived at Amicalola Falls State Park yesterday afternoon. After much fuss with our (new to us) RPod, we still managed to make some progress for this big adventure I’m about to embark on. 
First, I signed the official through hiker registry.  I’m #1579!  I’ve packed,unpacked, and repacked my backpack at least 3 times. The final weight of my pack is 31 pounds.  That’s pretty average for a winter gear pack. I took some photos with my backpack on so you can see how STUFFED it is! 
I went to a little class on hiking in Georgia this afternoon.  It really was only me there so I got the readers digest version.  Glad I did it though because I had made a mistake packing that could have been detrimental.  Hence the third unpacking and repacking. 
It was there at the class where I met and made my first through hiker friend. His name is Zip Code and he will be riding to the start of our hike with Papa Big Swig and I in the morning. He already knew who I was because of this journal. I’m looking forward to reading his journal from last year.  
In signing off I want to wish my grandson Dawson a very happy 8th birthday!  Today is his special day! I love you so much buddy!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585164,"I woke this morning in our camper at Amicalola Falls State Park.  Papa Big Swig and I met Zip Code at the lodge for breakfast. They really do a good job with their buffet. 
I learned more about Zip Code. He’s a retired postal worker and Zip Code just fit him for a trail name! I think this is his 8th year on the trail, he knows it backwards and forwards.  He shared his wisdom with me, and I’m so grateful!  
Papa Big Swig drove us around the mountain to a parking lot. We skipped the approach trail as both of us have hiked it before and all of those miles don’t even count!  Papa Big Swig and I brought our dogs and we all summited Springer Mountain. This is the official start of the A.T.  The photo is of me beside the first white blaze. We went back down the mountain the same way we came up, Papa Big swig and the dogs went back to our campsite,  and I headed north! Zip Code was long gone, but I’m sure glad for the information he gave me.  
So, while I only get credit for 8.6 miles of the A.T., I actually hiked 13 miles today. We don’t get credit for the hike up Springer Mountain, only for the hike down as the trail begins on the top. We also don’t get credit for any blue blazes we take to a scenic spot or a privy. That being said, I had hiked about 7 miles today before I began to think UGGHH! I had a brief moment of doubt. That 31lb pack felt 50lbs and the ups kept going up!   I just told myself in my best dad voice  “you’re stronger than this sis” and I persevered. 
Today marks exactly 12 years since my father passed.  I knew I was going to start my hike today no matter what. Rain, shine, sleet, or snow I was starting today!  Maybe I should have been the postal worker?!? At any rate,  God saw fit to give this day sunshine and soft breezes. It was beautiful.  
I hiked past Hawk Mountain Shelter where most of today’s through hikers stopped for the night. I was thirsty and out of water, but I came to a creek and filled up.  This is the first time I’ve intentionally drank creek water. I used my sawyer squeeze filter and it tasted like Evian to me!  
About a mile past the shelter was Hightower Gap with a parking lot. This is where Papa Big Swig picked me up and brought me back to our campsite.  I’m princess hiking these first two days, and it’s wonderful!  He grilled great big turkey burgers for dinner and I got a shower. I’ll also have a warm bed tonight, but up and at’em early to start again where I left off tonight.

",Hightower Gap,"Mar 28, Wed",8.60
Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585243,"I woke up this morning in my nice warm camper again.  Papa Big Swig drove more than an hour to get me back to Hightower Gap so I could pick up where I left off. 
Just as we pulled up Apache came trekking across to start the upward climb for today.  He stopped for some early morning chit chat and told us about his trail experience. He hiked last year and made it all the way to Connecticut. Then he got sick with Lyme Disease. It cut his hike short, but he’s back this year with a great attitude!  Good luck Apache! 
The first couple of miles were up, but comfortably so.  It was quite foggy but the birds still sang their morning songs.  I was alone on the mountain and it was nice.   
Eventually I came down to Cooper’s Gap and there were 3 hikers taking a break.  I had met two of them yesterday. They are Steve and Justin. Neither one has a trail name yet. They had Pyro along with them.  He’s a young’n with too many life stories for his age.  
I failed to mention yesterday that my right knee had started giving me grief, and by the time I reached Cooper’s Gap it was back at it.  I slack packed today and failed to take my duck tape. Steve stepped right up to give me his duck tape  for some knee support.  Then again later for a heel blister.  So with his permission the photo today is of my trail angel Steve. 
We were sitting at the base of Sassafras Mountain, which was today’s biggest climb.  The 4 of us set out together to conquer the challenge. Sassafras Mountain’s elevation is 3500ft and the last 1000ft were brutal. The locals call it(cover your ears)“sassafrassy kick your assy”. There’s a good reason for that!  
Once we summitted Sassafras we decided to eat our lunch right there. I had peanut butter on a tortilla. It was windy up there and pretty chilly so we ate quickly and went on to hike our own hikes. 
I spent the rest of the day by myself.  It was so beautiful.  Switchbacks on the trail had me crossing the same creek a few times. I didn’t mind it at all. The creek was so refreshing.  
I’m a pretty slow hiker. By the time I reached Gooch Shelter most of the other through hikers were there for the night. I didn’t even stop. I walked right on past about 2 miles to the parking lot where my hubby was patiently waiting.  I cannot say enough about how nice it is to see his face after a day in the mountains. 
He took me straight to Chick Fil A where I ate like a pig!  I had a #1 meal with a large diet soda, and a vanilla milkshake.  I’m not even sorry I ate it all!  
At this point we’re going to play it by ear for tomorrow.  Papa Big Swig was suppose to drop me off at Gooch Gap then hook up our camper and go home, but it has started pouring rain. If it’s raining in the morning I may take a zero tomorrow and have Papa Big Swig hang out with me one more day.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585318,"I toyed with the idea of taking a zero today. So glad that I didn’t! I mostly hiked alone the first half of the day.  When I came upon a good water source I met up with Mike from Maine(now known as flower boy).  We hiked to the gap and stopped for lunch.  I had a kind bar, he had peanut butter and a tortilla.  There was a privy at the gap and trash receptacles.  A hikers delight!   
I hiked alone for a while again and somehow I went off trail. I turned around to go back and realized where I had gone wrong. Or so I thought.  The next thing you know I’m walking towards Shakira and Texas(previously Justin & Steve). I told them they were going the wrong way.  They insisted that they were not going the wrong direction. THEY were right!!! Good grief I had gone the entire wrong way again!  They’ve been my trail Angels  two days in a row now.  
We enjoyed a great view for a few minutes and somehow I managed to get to Lance Creek despite myself... probably because I followed them down. 
My princess hiking days are over.  I had no hubby at the end of my day. I managed to pitch my tent with minimal help, hung my bear bag with more minimal help, and made a mess with my dinner!  It boiled over, and burned my finger.  I’m such a freshman in the hiking world!  
As I’m typing this from my tent, I’m listening to other hikers laughing while sharing stories from their lives.  I will soon go out and join them.  Down by the creek a party has started.Somebody is playing guitar and singing. 
There’s no privy here, and I’m wondering where on earth I’m going to potty!  I’ve also realized my flip flops aren’t good because I can’t wear my socks with them, and the shirt I brought to sleep in is uncomfortable. Oh and changing clothes in a single person tent is not easy! 
The good news is that we only have 8 miles to  Neels Gap tomorrow where I can remedy most of these problems.  I think we’re going to rent a cabin and split it 4 ways tomorrow night.  It’s getting down to 38 degrees tonight so a cabin will feel great!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585421,"I woke up at 3:15am and just could not fall back asleep.  It was a snoring ensemble all around me! Shakira’s tent was by mine and he said he’s pretty sure I have sleep apnea.  I guess I scared him. He said I gurgled!  Anyway, he tuned in to listen for another breath. Papa Big Swig has said he sometimes waits for me to take another breath... maybe I do have sleep apnea?!? 
None the less, I felt great this morning! I had peanut butter and a tortilla for breakfast. Packed up camp and took off on my own.  I’m the slowest hiker in our group so I start first and end last every day. 
Today was Blood Mountain. I started out going up and literally went mostly up for 5 miles!  Blood Mountain is 4400ft elevation the climb was long, but the view was beautiful!  There were a lot of day hikers up there today. Many of them with dogs. I dropped my pack and sat with them. The view was clear for miles. I probably sat there too long, but I ate some Chipotle Tuna for lunch, drank lots of water and left  Blood Mountain with a full belly and a full heart.   My goal today was Neels Gap. There’s an outfitter located right there on the trail. In front of the store is a big tree with lots of hiking boots tossed up in it.  Rumor has it that folks hike as far as Neels Gap and call it quits by throwing their boots up in the tree. For the record, I did not throw my boots. 
I arrived at Neels Gap around 3pm. The rest of my crew was already here.  We had planned to rent a cabin and split it 4 ways, but Feather joined in so we split it 5 ways. It’s working out perfectly. Two guys in the upstairs bed, us girls in the downstairs bed, and flower boy on the sofa.  We all had pizza for supper.  It was the best frozen pizza I’ve ever had!  Since tomorrow is Easter we would like to take a zero and maybe stay another night.  We don’t know yet if we can keep the cabin, so we’ll see what happens when tomorrow comes.  
It’s extremely strange how the 5 of us met just 4 days ago and yet we feel a bit like family. We’re calling ourselves “Tramily”, trail family.  Flower Boy says that’s what hiking together 40 miles through the mountains will do.  I agree.  
The conversation has been great!  Everything from pooping in the woods and farmers snots to Shakira’s reason for hiking. His wife recently passed away on February 12, that happens to be my sons birthday.  We both started our hike on March 28 which is the date of my fathers death, but also happens to be the birthdate of his wife Patti.  Patti fought breast cancer for 5 years before losing the battle.  He’s carrying her ashes on this hike and scatters a few at every beautiful view. I don’t think our meeting was happenstance.  
I will try to elaborate on one person in the “tramily” with each new post.  Everybody has a story, and they’re all worth hearing.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585488,"Happy Easter! Today is a day of faith and renewed hope.  Here in the hiker world we took a zero day.  My body definitely feels better from it. 
First thing this morning we tried to get our cabin for another night.  Easter blessings came to us, and for an additional $12 each we got another night at the Wild Boar cabin.  AKA the Hilton! 
For $8 each we got a shuttle into town and spent a long time at Walmart. It’s usually my least favorite place ever, but not today.  I didn’t need a lot of items because I was lucky enough to princess hike the first few days. I did pick up a sleeping bag liner and some hypoallergenic wet wipes.  I have cracks on my fingers from the old wet wipes. 
I had eaten cold pizza for breakfast before we left. That means I ate an entire Red Baron pizza by myself between supper last night and breakfast today!  Lunch time was rolling around though and right there was a Subway Sandwich Shop.  So for lunch we all had a sub.  I got the $5 daily lunch special which was a 6in meatball sub with Parmesan and black olives.  Mmmmm good!   But tonight for Easter dinner Texas is treating us to grilled burgers and hotdogs!  I can’t wait!  It’s certain to be the cherry on top!  
Texas will be my highlighted tramily member today.  He’s 41 years old and a newlywed.  Like literally a couple of months newlywed.  He’s only out here for 30 days, but hopes to meet us in Damascus for Trail Days in May.  He’s a Lawyer and is also in the Air National Guard. He’s actually leaving in thirty days to meet military requirements.  Thank you for your service Texas!  He reminds me of my son-in-law Alan. That means he’s a really good guy, and maybe a little nerdy.( in a good way)
It’s time to get my gear together for tomorrow.  Yesterday I mailed a few things home to lighten the load.  It’s so true that every ounce counts!  I even cut off part of my toothbrush handle!   Tomorrow will be my longest hiking day. 11+ miles to Low Gap.  One step at a time...

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585590,"I was up and out the cabin door by 7:30 this morning.  I only went a quarter mile before 3 other tramily members caught and passed me.   It would have been 4 but he stopped at the outfitters for shoes.  
The Journey started out up hill as it always does, but I felt good after a zero, and knocked out the first 3 miles fairly quick. It was hot today and I went through the water.  I stopped to go 100 yards off trail to a stream for water resupply, when I saw my first sign of a bear.  There it was...Bear poop!  I filled my water bottles and went back up to the trail. Just a short ways further up I ran into Texas. He had his new shoes and had passed me while I was getting water. I enjoyed the view a moment and went on. He quickly caught up to me and we hiked the next mile or so together( sort of). The trail crossed a road at the base of our biggest climb and there sitting on the bed of his truck was a trail angel.  He had fruit and water for us. We each took a Halo and a bottled water, dropped our packs for a minute before taking on the nearly straight up 1  mile climb staring right at us.  Turns out this gentleman and Texas had a love of airplanes in common. Texas is actually in the Air National Guard. I had posted reserves previously, but it’s fixed now.  He’s a pilot too! 
I went ahead and started the climb while they talked. I’m so grateful for the water and tangerine.  I would not have made it over that mountain without the hydration and fuel.  Texas caught up and passed me during the climb. I spent the rest of my hike alone.  I think I had about 5 miles left.   
Alone time on the trail leaves your mind wide open.  I had a bajillion conversations with myself.  Mostly things like my pack isn’t fitting quite right, to getting rid of my cotton clothing.  It gets so sweaty and doesn’t dry out over night.  Today for the first time I had to do some real soul searching. Even a little motivational speaking to myself. I got through it and arrived at Low Gap somewhere close to 6 pm.   
Thank GOD for my tramily!  They had a pad ready for my tent, gave me water when I arrived, and saved two hotdogs for me. They even cooked my hotdogs while I put up my tent.   Lifesavers!   
We’re all exhausted, it was a big hike today.   Tomorrow is 7 miles only.  
My next featured tramily member will be Flower Boy, but I’m just too tired to write anymore tonight.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585695,"As usual the day started out going up.  We tend to camp in gaps between two mountains, so the only way out is up.  
Yesterday was difficult for me physically and Texas is nursing a couple of aches so he decided to hike with me today.  We chose to only do 7 miles to Blue mountain shelter. The last big up for us was Blue Mountain, and the plan had been for the tramily to meet at Blue mountain shelter. Water was sparse today, and it was HOT on those mountains. I was too dry, and definitely did not have enough calories in me, so Blue Mountain was a tough climb at 4010ft elevation!  For my medical friends I voided a small amount at 7am and did not  void again until after 5:30pm.  I was too dry the day before as well so this was not good.  I felt dizzy, and a little nauseous.  Even still, the hike was beautiful. Lots of green and even a few flowers are coming out. It was the prettiest day so far. Anyway, just before we reached the shelter about 7/8 of the way up Blue Mountain there was a sketchy looking trickle of spring water. I was so thirsty that I didn’t care what it looked like. I drank over a liter and filled up a bottle to carry.  I ate some turkey jerky too.  Much improved!  
We reached the shelter, and no Tramily members were there.  The shelter really was not well protected from the winds, and a storm is rolling in tonight so we don’t blame them for moving on.  Everyone should hike their own hike.  
After reevaluating our situation we also decided to go two more miles to Unicoi Gap and have a shuttle bring us to town.  A welcomed opportunity for a storm free comfy night in a hotel.  Texas called our shuttle guy from Neels Gap. He said he would pick us up at 4:30.  We waited until after 5pm and no sign of Gene.  The wind started picking up and it was turning cool. We had to put our jackets on.  I finally decided what the heck, I’m hitching a ride.  And for the first time in my life I hitchhiked!  It only took about 5 minutes before a young man in a pickup truck stopped. We threw our things in the bed and I climbed in there with our gear.  Texas rode up front.(my preference) The young man took us straight to our hotel and wouldn’t accept a penny for his time. He was coming home from work in Hiawassee to Helen and “it was no trouble” he said. 
We arrived in Helen with plenty of daylight.  I’ve never been to or even heard of Helen Georgia before, but it’s the cutest  little place!  We loved it! I think it’s a fantastic vacation spot for a long weekend or Spring break. 
Dinner was BBQ with baked beans and coleslaw. Texas also got an appetizer to share.  It was cheese fries with bacon, pulled pork, and pickled okra. DELICIOUS!!  Drink refills were free, so I refilled my cup twice. 
On the way to a local market after dinner we walked past a park with a waterfall.  For a joke we got out our water bottles and Sawyer Squeeze to take a photo.  We sent it to the rest of the tramily with a caption “great water source here”!  That spawned a funny group text.  Turns out they were on top of Tray Mountain today when we were at the bottom at Unicoi Gap.  Only about a mile from us.  I hope they fair well tonight with the weather.  At some point our tramily will become completely separated. It’s just the way the trail works. But if I never see the other 3 again, it’s been a blast!  
My hi-lighted tramily member today is Flower Boy.(aka flowers, Mike from Maine). Flower Boy owned a flower shop for many years.  He’s extremely talented!  For our Easter dinner he stepped outside and cut some greenery  with a cute little purple flower to make us a centerpiece for dinner.  In addition he made a fancy tomato mozzarella treat with fresh basil & balsamic vinegarette drizzled on top.  Yummy!   He sold his flower shop in 2016(I think) and also a fitness center he owned. Now he has rental property and enjoys life!  But he misses his flower shop. If there’s anything I can personally say about Flower Boy it’s that he’s one of the kindest most caring people I’ve ever been fortunate enough to meet.  And he’s got a sense of humor that keeps us all laughing.  Sometimes until we can’t breathe!  He’s the one who carried the hotdogs we could not eat at Easter dinner, and it was him who cooked mine for me when I finally arrived very late to camp. I don’t think I would have eaten otherwise. In addition he helped with my tent while I was eating.  He’s also been our weather man!  We’re thinking of doubling his salary! It’s been great getting to know you, Flower Boy and if I don’t see you again before hand, I hope to see you in Maine!  
I’ll put my boots back on tomorrow and continue this awesome journey

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585752,"I woke up this morning at the Quality Inn in Helen GA.  It was wet outside from the giant storm that rolled by around 3am.  I only know this because Gene our shuttle guy told us about it.  He said it was a symphony outside.  I missed the performance!  It was a good night of sleep 
Texas and I decided to go out for breakfast this morning. Yesterday I learned that a female burns approximately 590 calories every hour when she hikes on the A.T.   Men burn over 600 calories per hour.  When we calculated my calories, I realized  that I have been shorting myself a lot!  No wonder my body gave me a hard time yesterday.  My breakfast this morning of homemade corned beef hash with two eggs and bread had to have been 2000 calories. I drank water and Gatorade, and had a great day hiking!  
Water was plentiful today. There were two good ups but otherwise mostly ridge hiking and downs. Ridges are my favorite because you almost always have a view.  It is windy today though, so depending which side of the mountain I was on made a difference.     
I hiked by myself most of the day.  Came upon some trail magic at Tray Mountain Gap.  It was bottled water.  I drank a whole one and ate a KIND bar before I started up. Tray Mountain was my big climb today at 4398ft. The summit had a view for miles!  Breathtaking is the only word I have. 
The wind continued to increase, and the temperature is dropping so I stopped after 6 miles near a shelter with a privy. Texas was already here.  The shelter only holds 8 and I was number 15 or so, which means I’m in my tent.  It’s falling into the 20’s tonight up here on this mountain. I guess my sleeping bag will be put to the test.  I’m layered up, but I’m shivering.  I’ve got my Sawyer Squeeze in my sleeping bag with me so it doesn’t freeze up. Bad things can happen when your filtering device stops working!  
My last tramily member to highlight is Feathers. I find her the most interesting of all of us. She’s 36 years old, a single mom of a daughter and the epitome of what I feel a strong woman really is.  She’s lived several places in the country and made it on her own as an artist. Not just any artist.  She’s done amazing work in NYC and other places.  Check her out at katecloudart.com  Feathers is also a well seasoned hiker. She’s the youngest person in our tramily, but she beats us all with experience.  She has a good soul and a strong spirit.  So glad the trail brought us together. 
I need to give thanks to everyone who leaves messages in my guest book. I read every one of them, and I’m feeling the love!  
Tomorrow is a long day so I’m going to try to sleep while this wind is whipping my tent every which way.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585851,"Last night was difficult.  The shelter/tent site was nearly at the top of Tray Mountain.  I swear each mountain has its own weather system. The wind blew all day yesterday and just as I reached the shelter the temperature began dropping quickly.  I don’t know how cold it actuality got up there on that mountain , but there was a freeze warning in the town below.  My little tent held up well to endless 40mph wind gusts all night long, and my Big Agnes down sleeping bag kept me snug.  
About 6:45 am the wind stopped, and today was a beautiful new sunshiny day.  Myself, Samantha, and Orlando(new trail friends)sat on the side of the shelter to watch a glorious sunrise!  This is why we do what we do! 
One good thing about sleeping at the top is that your day starts going down!  That was nice for me because we had to do 11 miles today.  This is the second time I’ve hiked that far, and the last time was brutal.  I knocked out the first 4 miles quickly, but the sun came up and it was hot!!  I’m also having problems with foot blisters so I was pretty slow until the end.  
There’s something rewarding though about going slow.  Today I met a hiker named Half Slow.  He’s a 65 years old Vietnamese man, and he looks maybe 50 years old at most.  He took a blue blaze to get some water, and I almost passed it up but at the last minute decided I might need some more water since we still had about 5 miles to go. When I arrived at the stream there he was with his boots off enjoying the cool water on his feet.  He invited me to join him.  I took off my socks and hiking boots, and laid out my socks to dry. They were a little wet with sweat. He took a homemade scoop and poured water over my calves and the tops of my feet, then he offered me some Tang. It was so refreshing!  Half Slow has hiked the PCT.  He’s half slow because he stops every two hours to take care of his feet which are blister free, and he doesn’t pass up the views.  The other part of him is half fast.  He hikes with the speed of a 20 year old!  From now on I’m going to be half slow too and take care of my feet...well at MY sloth pace I may become whole slow!  lol 
I hiked the last 4 miles today with Orlando. She’s newly retired at 59 years of age, and plans to go the distance to Maine. I have no doubts that she will make it.  We were the last ones in. (I’m used to that). It was awesome to see Sam and her husband Mike waiting there for us to give us a ride into Hiawassee.  No hitchhiking today!  Also Texas waited for me, and Susan another new trail friend was there.  Mike and Sam were done with their section hike today, but they stuck around to be our trail angels.  When Orlando and I got in they had a cold can of pop and some Cheetos waiting for each of us!  Mmmm good! 
We chose to do 11 miles today because more cold and rain is expected tomorrow and Saturday, so we need to get to a town. The Holiday Inn Express is now inundated with Through Hikers! Most of us enjoyed a buffet dinner, all you can eat for $8.95.  My belly is full now and I’m considering heading down to the hot tub. It would be nice to stick my aching feet into some warm water.  
Planning to zero the next two days due to inclement weather.  My feet need a break too.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585914,"I woke this morning around 6:45am and quickly ran to the one and only washing machine this hotel offers.  There’s probably 50 hikers here all trying to get their laundry done.  By the grace of God it was available! 
From the third floor laundry I could smell bacon!  I quickly went back to the room and coerced Texas into going downstairs for breakfast. It wasn’t my first choice for food, but it sufficed. I was stuffed!  
After breakfast I threw my wet clothes into the dryer and laid back down.  I fell fast asleep!  I think about three hours later I made it back to the dryer, and my clothes were still there!   I thought for sure they would at least be on top of the dryer.  So glad my morning nap didn’t mess anybody up.  
No hiking miles today. It’s rainy and cold!  
I got a new roommate here at the Holiday Inn Express. Orlando stayed at the Hostel last night, but she wanted a posh day in the hotel. That worked out good for me because Texas’ wife flew in to see him today so they got a room of their own. Lucky me, I’ve been able to split the cost each day.  Tomorrow Orlando and I both will take the shuttle back to Top of Georgia Hostel where we will spend our last night before getting back on the trail Sunday morning.  I think Texas is taking an extra day with his bride. I hope we get to meet up again before his thirty days are over.  
Orlando, Texas, and I walked to Blimpies for lunch.  I’ve never had one of their subs before but it was good.  Mine was buffalo chicken with all the fixin’s and ranch dressing.  
The purpose of zero days is to rest your body and work on the ailing parts.  Most hikers try to use their zero days during times of bad weather. Backpacks weigh a lot and wet backpacks weigh a lot more!   And at least you don’t feel guilty not putting in the miles.  
My current ailments are horrible blisters on my feet, swollen aching right knee, and cracks on my fingers and thumb.  I walked to the local grocery store today and bought a few things to help remedy my issues.  I hope they work.  In the meantime I can already tell the rest is helping. Fingers crossed for a pain free start on Sunday.  
 It was the $8.95 buffet for supper again tonight.  You can’t beat the food or the price.  A hikers delight!  
I think I’ll go back to the hot tub now and give my feet a treat.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586045,"Today was another zero.  I told myself it was due to inclement weather, but actually the daytime weather would have been great for hiking.  Mother Nature did show up this evening though.  It would have been a miserable night in my tent.  
So here I am at Top Of Georgia Hostel.  They’re very strict here with the rules, but they’re only a half mile from my starting place in the morning.  They also offer a shuttle down there PROMPTLY at 8am and/or 9am.  If I miss both of those times, I will be walking!  
Orlando and I spent the morning transitioning from the Holiday Inn Express to the Hostel.  They picked us up with their shuttle and brought us here around 9am.  We weren’t allowed in our bunk room until noon, so we sat around the main area and used the WiFi.  
I FaceTimed with my grandkids!  It was nice catching up with them.  Keep my grandson Logan in your thoughts.  He recently read for a part in a play. He’s hoping to get the part of a dog, but we all would like him to be the Mad Hatter. I hope those making the casting selections can see that in him.(and that he sees it In himself too). 
At noon we could get into our bunk room. I ate 2 hot dogs for lunch, and then I laid down with ice on my knee and Country music in my ears.  I think I dozed a bit.  I remember listening to Kenny Chesney and thinking I have seen him 7 times!  Then I thought... big deal.  I was even more lucky to have known Chuck Nott...now that’s a big deal!  
Met 3 new hikers in the bunk room. One of them is an older gentleman from North Carolina.  He spent two years nursing his wife through cancer treatments, and she’s now cancer free!  This hike was her gift to him.  Pretty awesome gift I think. 
My sis-in-laws drove up from Cartersville to see me.  I knew they might, but I didn’t want to get my hopes too high.  When it really happened, I came to tears! It was so nice seeing them!   The most beautiful faces of the day!  They drove me a town over for a much needed Walmart run. I’m now stocked and ready for the 4/5 days hike to Franklin.  Can’t believe I’m almost to North Carolina!  
After Walmart they asked what next?  Of course I said dinner!  They knew my tramily was meeting up for dinner in Franklin this evening.  Texas’ wife was here with a rental car so the two of them drove over to meet up with Flower Boy, Shakira, and Feathers who have already hiked that far.  Because of my curfew at the hostel and a chance to be with family I chose not to go. But Tammy & Mary Ann weren’t having that!  So, tonight my family got to meet my tramily!  Every single one of them!  Dinner was not a sit down get served dinner... it was off a food truck at a brewery, but I am satisfied, and my heart is full.  Tammy & Mary Ann were definitely my trail angels today!  
The time off has been good for my feet and knee. Both are improved. By the grace of God I will hike again tomorrow.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586132,"Orlando and I caught the shuttle at 9am to Dicks Creek Gap.  It was pretty chilly this morning in the low 40’s, but It only took the first up for me to decide to take off my coat. It really was a great hiking morning!  
Right about lunch time ice shavings started falling from the trees. So much so that I had to check several times to make sure it wasn’t snowing.  I was near the top of a mountain at the time, and as I looked around I saw a crystal forest.  Most bizarre thing ever!  I sat on a rock, and put my jacket back on to watch it for a while.  When I started hiking again all I could hear was the ice crunching beneath my feet.  A few other hikers came by during this event equally confused as myself.  Orlando was a good ways behind me at the time, but she said she saw it too. 
So after the ice episode, about half way up the next mountain it turned into a mid summer day.  This is no exaggeration!  When I say each mountain has its own weather system, I really mean it.  
I hiked 4.6 miles to a shelter.  My intention was to stay there tonight, and for once I could get a spot in the shelter! Orlando arrived a few minutes behind me and we both decided it was too early to stop hiking for the day.  We did another 4.5 miles to Bly Gap.  The cool thing about Bly Gap is that it’s in North Carolina!!!!    That’s right folks I’m out of Georgia!!  
Over all it was a good day for me physically.  I think I’m finally getting my hiking legs.  
Tonight will be challenging.  It’s very cold up here in my tent.  I’m sure it will be below freezing again.  We have some hikers around us who like to party loudly, and even though they apologize every 10 minutes it continues.   This is my first experience with loudmouths on the trail.  The fire is roaring so I’m pretty sure they’ll be up late.   Orlando and I have retreated to our tents.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586216,"It was still drizzling this morning when I woke up.  A storm had rolled through sometime during the night. I ran to the nearest far away tree for my morning business, and was shaking from the frigid rain. 
I was too cold to try to cook anything for breakfast, so I had peanut butter on a tortilla and a cheese stick.  I knew the sooner I got moving, the sooner I would warm up. So I packed up a wet tent, and started  moving. Sure enough about 5 minutes into my first up I was too hot to keep my jacket on. 
It was very foggy this morning, but just as we came to the top of our first mountain we could see the clouds right beside us.  It felt like we could just reach out and touch them. Orlando said “isn’t that beautiful”.   Right then and there we both forgot all about our rough start to the day. 
It was only 3 miles to a shelter so we made the decision to stop and stay. A shelter is a 3 sided mice ridden structure with a roof.  It gave us the opportunity to hang a line and start drying out our equipment.  We’ll be sleeping on the shelter platform tonight with about 4 other people.  
I made myself a hot chocolate when I arrived, and after chores were done I made a Mountain House meal.  It was hot and satisfying!  
Today’s hike is called a Nero, nearly a zero.  Both Orlando and I could have hiked on, but we would have been putting up a wet tent and sleeping in a damp sleeping bag. It’s supposed to be down in the 40’s tonight, so the shelter was our decision. 
It’s  3:30 PM now and others are coming off the trail to settle down for the night. I think a  couple of guys are trying to get a fire started.(not looking promising) Our clothes line is already in full use.  Everybody has wet gear!  
On a good note, the rhododendrons are coming out in full force. They’re so beautiful making a canopy of green on the trail. Next month they will bloom and double the beauty.  The birds are getting busy too.  I saw a really fat robin this morning searching for any morsel she could find at camp, and here at the shelter were a pair of titmouse birds busy building their nest. I love their tail feathers...so pretty!

Yesterday I got a message from Texas that his Achilles is not better, so he went home with his wife.   I hate to lose my hiking buddy, but I completely understand.  I lost Orlando today too.

I hiked alone all day today. It was great!  The terrain in North Carolina is much easier on my knees.  I stopped every couple of hours and took care of my feet, and I even took a couple of blue blazes just to see the views.  After all, that’s why I’m here.  It feels good to hike my own hike. I’m planning another 12+ miles tomorrow because Papa Big Swig will be there at the end.  I can’t wait to see his smiling face!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586430,"I woke up this morning in my tent. It was about 34 degrees outside.  Mornings are the worst part of my day. It’s always very cold and it’s hard to get going, but I make myself move in hopes of warming up.  
I walked to the privy so I could potty and change clothes.  The privy’s are not enclosed structures. They are a small three walled building with a roof.  They are built up high, and a hole is dug below it.  There is usually a wooden bench with a toilet seat attached to it.  Voil’a! A place to potty and change.  Needless to say at 34 degrees with a slight breeze, changing clothing is the last thing I want to do in there, but I do it quickly and start breaking down camp.  
It always amazes me how the weather changes throughout the day. I decided not to wear my jacket from the get go. It was a smart move. 10 minutes into my hike I was sweating, and by noon I had taken off my long sleeved shirt. I think it got up to 60 degrees today. That left me in a sleeveless shirt until about 5pm when the temp again changes drastically to really really cold!  It will be almost freezing again tonight.  
North Carolina’s trail is well maintained, but there are still signs of the horrible forest fire they had two years ago. I took my time again today to see the views from the blue blazes.  It was a fairly gentle easy hike until about mile 7. Then the up started. It was all boulders, and I had to physically pull myself up and over several times. Most of the boulders were as big as a small car. This takes time with a 32lb pack on my back. But I made it all the way up Albert Mountain 5210 feet of elevation! Today’s photo is of the view atop Albert Mountain.  
I spent a good while up there soaking it all in before starting back down the other side. About a half mile later I crossed the 100 mile mark!  Can you believe it?  I’m more than 100 miles into the A.T.!  
The rest of my hike was just pleasant.  No other word for it.  I hiked a little while with Melissa and her dog Basil. We’ve met up the last two days around 3pm. It’s just our time.  She’s much faster than me so we chat about 20 or 30 minutes while hiking at my pace, then she gets back into her fast pace. Turns out she and her boyfriend are moving from Nashville to Vermont.  He’s picking up Basil in a few days, and Melissa will be walking the rest of the way to Vermont!  
So once Melissa moved on, I was left to walk alone again. When I had about a mile left to go, I looked up and saw Papa Big Swig walking towards me with our fur babies!  Yay!! Yay!! Yay!!  
Papa Big Swig had yellow rice and chicken waiting for me at the camper. I ate until my belly was stuffed!  I took a warm shower, ate some ice cream, and right now I’m laying in a comfy bed!   
You guessed it!  Tomorrow I will be princess hiking again!   I’ve got him for a few weeks of princess hiking.  This will be great!  I’ll be able to put in larger miles with less wear and tear on my body.  I thank God for him every day.  It takes an understanding spouse to support such a big adventure.  I’m blessed.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586513,"I woke up a little later than usual this morning.   Papa Big Swig made oatmeal with nuts and berries, coffee, and a banana.  A great start to a great day!  
Since I haven’t seen Orlando in a few days I decided to do a flip flop.  That means I had hubby drop me off 10 miles north and I hiked back to where I had stopped yesterday.  I was hoping we would cross paths. I saw lots of familiar faces but not hers.  
This is a good time for me to tell you that I was a little turned around this morning. The mountains can do that to you. I walked 7/10 of a mile north when I first took off.  And of course it was all up!  I kept hearing my dad say “the sun is your compass”.  I knew if I was going south in the morning the sun should be on my left and it wasn’t. Instinctively I just turned around and went back where I came from.   About 1/2 way back I ran into a Nobo who confirmed my direction suspicions.  Am I ever glad that my dad took the time to teach me how to use the sun. 
My favorite hiking partner went with me today.  We were alone a lot so I let her run off leash.  She was so well behaved!  I leashed her up twice when we crossed paths with other dogs, and once to cross a road.  She listened the first time and waited for her leash.    That’s my girl Seylor Jo!  
We had some delicious trail magic at Winding Stair Gap.  I drank a Dr Pepper and ate some chips. Just what I needed for the next up. Seylor had some doggie biscuit magic along the way too. 
This was another mostly ridge hiking day. As you know, I love that because there’s always some sort of view.  The only bad thing about ridge hiking is trying to find a place to potty.  If there’s switchbacks, you’re in full view!  Oh well, gotta do what you gotta do. 
One of the dogs we crossed paths with today was a German Shepherd named Morrison. He and his mommy, Hugs, had stayed in the shelter near my tent the night before last.  Hugs is hurting,  so Papa Big Swig picked her up where he let me off this morning, she had planned to try to slack pack with me tomorrow.  
Slack packing means you hike with a day pack only.  Food, water, bear mace, trowel, wet wipes, bug spray, and an odorless bag for your trash.   It’s about a 10lb hikers delight!   So today I officially was a flip flop slack packer!   And even though I headed south today, I’m still a Nobo.  
Seylor and I waited back at Rock Gap about 30 min for Papa Big Swig and Hugs to pick us up.  A couple of trail angels who are local veterans drove up the mountain to visit.  They brought us hikers some cold Budweisers. I thanked them for the beer and for their service. Corporal Smith is 80 years old and just enjoys cheering us on. He was a highly educated man with some good stories to tell. The other angel calls himself Happy Jack. He’s younger (60-ish)and hopes to open Happy Jack’s Hostel next year. I wish him well. 
No word from Orlando, but others reported that she’s doing fine and plans to be at Rock Gap Shelter tonight.  Papa Big Swig sent a big bag of burgers and some pizzas to Rock Gap shelter tonight, and in exchange for the Magic they promised me they would let Orlando charge her phone on their source enough to contact me. Praying she gets there safe and well. 
Currently I’m sitting at a walk-in clinic with Hugs.  She’s a Nurse Practitioner( no wonder we are friends) and she fears a stress fracture.  An X-ray is in process as I type. I hate complaining, but my right knee is a mess too. I’m coming back in the morning for a cortisone injection. Hopefully that will nip it in the bud and let me hike on with less pain.  
If the moon and stars align I’ll be eating some Mexican food in a few minutes.

That clinic was my trail angel today!
We left there and started driving to Wayah Gap.  It’s quite a drive which meant my start would be about 11:00am. I had decided to do a Nero of only 5 miles.  This way I could be done before dark, and take it a little easy on my newly injected knee.   
 Then what to my wondering eyes should appear?  A text from Orlando saying “I’m here”!  
Thank you Jesus she is well!  Hubby turned the vehicle around and we drove straight back to Rock Gap.  There she was talking with her hubby on the phone, backpack and poles on the ground, all in one piece!   Just like that we were headed back to Franklin.

Hugs’ foot is not fractured.  It’s a rather severe case of plantar fasciitis.  She’s at least 4 days off the trail.  I’ll have to move on ahead of her.  That’s how the trail works. I’ll be taking time off in June, and we’ll probably meet back up in July.  
Orlando is staying with us tonight, and we should be slack packing tomorrow.  I’m 10 miles ahead of her right now. We’ll have to strategize our start and pick-up locations.  It’s a lot of driving for Papa Big Swig!  Hoping it works out so she can stay and slackpack a few days.  
 
I never did get my Mexican dinner, but tonight looks promising.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586726,"I got up early this morning and grabbed my day pack, Orlando grabbed hers too.  We were soon loaded up to go find our respective starting places.  Papa Big Swig pulled through McDonalds for breakfast.   We ate in the SUV on the way. Sausage McMuffin meal for me and an iced coffee W/sugar free vanilla syrup.  Orlando got me started on the iced coffee. Pretty sure it’s going to be my new thing for a while. 
Papa Big Swig drove us back to Rock Gap for Orlando to start her hike. She did a 10 mile day northbound to Wayah Gap.  I started at Wayah Bald and did only 4 miles southbound to Wayah Gap.  Now I’m only 4 miles ahead of Orlando, and we can be picked up at the same place.  If the weather allows, she will make up those 4 miles tomorrow and we can begin slack packing together on Monday.  
It’s a lot on Papa Big Swig to be dropping us off and picking us up at different locations.  Even though I started out only 14 miles away from Orlando this morning, it took about 1.5 hours to drive from her starting point to mine.  I guess that’s the way it is in the mountains.  The driving is no big deal on a Saturday, but starting Monday he’ll be back at work and cannot do that.  Even still, I know I am very fortunate to have him here for a few weeks. I’m hoping his help allows me to catch my Tramily by the time I reach Damascus.  Even though we all text from time to time, I miss them.  
I started out on top of Wayah mountain today.  I liked that because my hiking began with a down!  I accidentally left my trekking poles in the SUV which means my knee took a beating. It’s a little sore now. Hoping that’s temporary.  Bet I don’t forget anymore! 
My 4 legged hiking partner came with me again today.  I just can’t believe how good she is on the trail!  I’ll take her often now that I know.  She’s such a good listener!  
 I arrived at Wayah Gap about an hour before Orlando so Seylor and I had lunch while we waited. I ate deer jerky and some left over trail mix Papa Big Swig had made some time ago ... yummy!  Seylor had a jumbone and some of my deer jerky.  We both drank water.  
We are back at the camper now getting ready for our free hiker dinner at a local German restaurant http://www.rathskellerfranklin.com/.  The mother of this restaurant owner has a B&B here in Franklin. Hugs is staying there during her recovery. This little lady is at least 80 years old, and as sweet as she can be! She takes care of the hikers, and her son carries on the tradition.  
A storm is rolling in tonight. It’s suppose to rain all day tomorrow.  Then Monday night the temps drop below freezing again.   The nice thing about hiking at my age is that we can afford to get off the trail when we need to, and most of the time avoid bad weather.(though I’ve been caught out there twice already).  Today during my flip flop I ran into Translator & Santa Claus, they’re in their twenties and they just can’t get off, so they’re going to hunker down in their tents. The longest I’ve been stuck in my tent is 11 hours. That’s a long time in a 1 person tent!  Again, I really do know I’m very lucky to have Papa Big Swig here.   
I’m beginning to realize a lot of things out here. For example, It’s so nice to see everyone behaving at their best.  Let me tell you what I mean by that. There’s all walks of life out here,  lawyers, dog walkers, nurses, unemployed, pilots, mechanics, waiters & waitresses, and so on. You really can’t tell who is who because we ALL look the same.  We’re all just hikers on one team.  Everybody helps everybody else with a good heart and genuine concern.   I love it!  I wish the whole world could be like this.  Something about having nothing makes one humble.  
Secondly, I think today’s youth get an unfair negative rap.  I’ve been so impressed with their campfire discussions.  Millennials are very aware of world situations, much less self centered than portrayed, and far more intelligent than they get credit for.  I was once one of those judgmental boomers, but I have faith in our future again. These kids will be ready when their turn comes.  
It’s been too long since i’ve thanked all of the folks who sign my guest book!  You are much appreciated!  I wish I could respond individually, but know that I read every one of them, and I am grateful.  
Whew! This is a long one!  Today’s photo is of Papa Big Swig.... my favorite trail angel!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586827,"I’m still here in Franklin North Carolina after a crazy night!  
Papa Big Swig, myself, Orlando, and Hugs went to the German restaurant/bar for our free hiker dinner.  We really enjoyed the small town hospitality!  Our meal was quite unique and I thought very tasty!  It was baked Mac-n-Cheese with a choice of toppings and a side of cornbread.  I chose homemade buffalo chicken on mine.  It was the chefs preference.  He said he soaked the chicken overnight in buttermilk and it had turned out delicious just as planned.  I agree!   Wish I knew how to make homemade buffalo chicken!  I didn’t try any of the other options, but there was chili, seafood, and vegetarian.  It was all eaten up!  At dusk there was a glow parade put on by a local hostel.  Sorry to have to say I missed it.  The highlight for me was a little 3 piece folk band. They were a family who regularly donates 1/2 of their earnings to charity.  Last night’s earnings went to the local Boy Scouts.  The cutest thing for me was their 3 maybe 4 year old grandson had his little toy drum set beside the stage and played right along with them!  He had his own tunes going on and was loving it!  We tipped the band $5 and gave the drummer a dollar bill!  I think he’s buying silly putty with it.  I’m going to try to upload a little video to the pictures/video section. Fingers crossed.  
For those of you who don’t know, you can look at all photos by clicking on the menu bars and going to photos.  It should be the the same for videos too.
On to the crazy night!  
We have an optional “tent room” we can put on the front of our camper when it’s parked. Our camper is an R-Pod and the room is technically called an R-dome.(pictured above) the dome is intended to be staked down like a tent, but this campsite has a concrete pad so Papa Big Swig used bricks to hold down the dome. That was all well and good until about 1:30am when the storm rolled in.  Gusts of wind at 40mph, rain and cold.   Orlando was sleeping out there, well trying to sleep.  And before long the whole room was flipped inside out!   What a scramble for recovery!  In the end Papa Big Swig took the entire room down and put the room contents mostly in the SUV and some in the camper.  We learned that our pull down table bed actually IS long enough for an adult!  Thankfully Orlando had a dry place to sleep.  
I have no idea what time we all finally fell asleep.  But some time before the sun came up the most rotten stench I’ve ever smelled woke me up. What on earth?!? I had to go smell Orlando’s sleeping bag... not that.  I went to the bathroom BLECH!   I could barely stand it!   By sun-up we were all on a mission to get rid of the smell.  To this minute I’m not sure what it was.  I’ve been to the laundromat and washed all clothing bedding etc, Papa Big Swig went through the camper.  I bought a raspberry scented deodorizer and it’s better.  Not gone, but better.  I’m wondering if all the rain caused an issue with sewage fumes? Whatever it was I’m ready for it all to be gone!  
The rain cleared for a couple of hours today.  That was nice.  All things will work out as they should.  
Tomorrow will be cold but I’ll be back out there with my boots on and a smile!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586955,"On the menu was Oatmeal with nuts & berries for breakfast. I  washed it down with a hot cup of coffee.
As has become our routine, we loaded ourselves up in the SUV for Papa Big Swig to drive to our starting point.  It wasn’t long before we saw snow capped mountains.   They were absolutely beautiful, and soon we would be in them.  
We saw a couple of young hikers walking the same direction as we were driving.  They were a good mile or more from the A.T. so we moved things around and squeezed them in.  1 Nissan Xterra, 5 adults, 2 dogs, and lots of backpacks! It was close quarters but they were grateful because it was cold this morning. Like 32 degrees cold! 
Our hike began on top of Wayah Bald mountain.  It was snow covered and windy!  A lookout tower is there but neither of us went up. There would have been no view. All around us was a white abyss of snow and clouds. There were a few other hikers we knew checking it out so we took time for a group photo.  They were waiting on a ride back into town because everything they owned was wet and frozen from camping the night before. 
We said our goodbyes, then Orlando and I started walking north. The trail was completely snow covered.  I took the lead. It was slow going. I had to use my trekking poles to feel for tree roots and rocks/boulders. Each step I took was taken cautiously and purposefully.  
We started on top this morning so that means we were going down!!  My favorite way to start the day!  But going down in the snow was tricky and soon I had my first fall!  My foot slipped right out from under me and I could hear my mom say “down goes McGinney”. I have no idea where that came from, but she always said it when the kids were learning to walk and they would plop down on their bottoms.  I made up my own spelling but it’s pronounced with a hard G sound.  
I got back up, brushed the snow off and carried on.  Somewhere over the course of the next mile I got ahead of Orlando.  There I was in a beautiful snow covered wonderland all alone.  I loved it!  The snow kept coming, and it was below freezing temps, but I was just fine.  
There was one big up. It was over 4,000ft elevation.  Just as I Reached the top there was Cold Springs shelter. It was perfectly positioned on the trail for a great place to stop for lunch. Before long Orlando arrived and we both took a 15 minutes break.  We quickly got cold while eating lunch as the sweat we just worked up climbing the mountain began to evaporate.    
A few other hikers arrived before we left. They planned to stay there the rest of the night as their clothing was frozen too. I hope they’re able to find warmth. One of them remembered Papa Big Swig had given them burgers a few days ago. They all sent thanks to him again.  
Orlando got ahead of me pretty quickly after lunch so I hiked the rest of the way alone. White flakes kept falling and it was so serene.  The miles passed by quickly until I saw Orlando waiting for me at the Tellico Gap parking lot.  This was my most favorite hiking day so far!    
Papa Big Swig moved the camper to Fontana Village today while we hiked.  It’s right beside the dam.  I’m not there yet, but he says it’s beautiful. 
Right now we’re at Stecoah Diner in a little mountain town also known as Stecoah.  The friendliest people run this place!  I can  clearly picture my friend Lisa running this little diner, it would be right up her alley.  I had a cheeseburger and fries. It was scrumptious!  Then I finished up with coconut pie and coffee.  
We have no internet or WiFi at our new campground, so I’ll end my entry now while I can upload it.  I’m planning to put my boots back on tomorrow.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587097,"Instead of fixing breakfast in our camper this morning we chose to try the campground lodge restaurant.  This was the best decision of the day! 
As we were walking in guess who was getting ready to walk out? Daddy Shakira and Flower Boy! There they were standing right in front of me. TRAMILY!!!!! Yes yes yes!  I only had time for a quick hug and a selfie, but it was great seeing them!  I was happy that Papa Big Swig finally got to meet them too. 
Breakfast for me was an order of pancakes and bacon with an extra side of bacon.  Yes, I ate all of the bacon!  The pancakes were more than I could eat though.  3 giant multigrain pancakes smothered in butter and syrup were promptly shared with Papa Big Swig, and I still left a portion on the plate.  
My hike started at Tellico Gap. A Gap always means... going up!   Elevation was 3859ft.  It’s certainly not the highest, but still a decent climb.  However, I’m noticing these climbs aren’t draining me like they used to.  It’s really happening, I’m getting my hiker legs! 
It was a short hike today so I just moseyed along enjoying my time in the mountains.  There was still some snow at the tops, but the trail was clear and surprisingly dry.  The sun was actually hot up there. I got all the way down to a sleeveless shirt today. What a drastic change from yesterday! The breeze was gently blowing and it all just balanced out to perfect hiking weather.  
There were several spectacular views today.  Above is a photo of just one of them.  As dad would say, “this is God’s country sis”.  Some of the views are better than others, but there’s no such thing as a bad view, because this IS God’s country. 
I’m still tending to my feet every couple of hours. Except yesterday was way too cold and wet. Somewhere around 1pm I came across a nice boulder to sit on, so I took off my shoes and socks, grabbed my trail mix and soaked in some splendor.  About that time a southbound hiker showed up.  I recognized him to be one of the hikers we had given a ride to yesterday.  He remembered me right away as well and said “Hey there Blue Raccoon”.  It’s funny how folks start knowing you by your trail name.  Turns out he was doing a flip flop today so he could go back and check on his hiking partner this evening.  Last night was bitter cold with lots of wind and snow and his buddy ended up with hypothermia.  It happens frequently.  I’m still so thankful to be slack packing a few more days. Sleeping in the warm camper is a gift. 
Today’s hike ended at the Nantahala Outdoor Center where Orlando had arrived about 30 minutes earlier.  We start together and end together, but we each hike our own hike out there. The N.O.C. is a milestone on the A.T.  It’s basically an outfitter on the trail, but they are right on the river and offer kayak rentals, lodging, a general store and more.  I signed the thru-hiker book and read for a minute to see who had been there before me.  It’s just a hiker thing to say you’ve been to the N.O.C. 
Papa Big Swig was there to get us at 4:30pm sharp. He did a little trail magic for another hiker before taking us back to the camper.  
It was turkey burgers cooked on the foreman grill with potato salad for supper.  Then a cream cheese frosted brownie for dessert.  Compliments of Papa Big Swig.  He’s spoiling us!  
Tomorrow I will put my boots back on. 
In closing I want to wish my granddaughter Lucie a very happy 6th birthday!  I love you little princess!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587197,"Papa Big Swig made cheesy scrambled eggs with turkey sausage for breakfast.  We headed to the N.O.C. with full bellies.  
When we pulled up to the N.O.C. there was a helicopter flying low. It had a long pole or rope hanging out the bottom. On the pole/rope was several rotating saw blades.  We watched in awe as this chopper went up and down trimming trees away from the mountain power lines.  It gave me a little anxiety to start hiking up the mountain underneath all of that business!  I was quite relieved when he flew away before I reached the area where he was cutting. It was even pleasant smelling the fresh cut trees and pines as I began my initial ascent.  
I say initial ascent, because the first 8 miles today were up! Up, switchback, up, switchback, and so on for 8 miles and 5,052ft elevation!  It was physically exhausting and emotionally challenging to say the least.  By far my hardest hiking day to date!  I can’t imagine what I would have done with a full pack on. 
Orlando and I usually hike separately but the ups today just kept us playing leap frog all day.  There were about 5/6 other hikers we played leap frog with too. But when we finally summited Cheoah mountain it was invigorating!  Today’s photo is of the view up there.  
I’ve recently uploaded several new photos. Trail Journals only allows me to feature one, but if you go to photos you can look at them all. 
As we were sitting up there enjoying our view we gave each other a high five. Of all the hikers who attempted this with us today everyone gave up somewhere and pitched their tents, except one other person and us!  Score one for determined middle aged women!  (And one middle aged man trail name beef steak). We would never bring it up to the younger hikers, but it really did feel good! 
So we had 5 miles to go and knew we would be going down from there. And we did go down a little bit..... then right back up again!   Good grief how many ups can one day have?!?  
The terrain was difficult today too.  There were far more than usual rocks and boulders.  That would be fine if they were smooth and even, but it wouldn’t be the A.T. If that were the case.  I hiked several miles on uneven oftentimes unstable jagged rocks.  My hiking boots don’t have a lot of give, and my feet are killing me tonight!  Well if I’m being completely honest my whole body hurts tonight!! 
I ran out of water with 3 miles to go. By the time I made it to where Papa Big Swig was waiting(40 minutes later than expected) I was parched and HANGRY!  Way beyond hungry!  We drove straight to that little diner in Stecoah where I drank 3 diet sodas.  I had the pulled pork dinner with a baked potato, corn, and Texas toast. Warm apple pie with ice cream for dessert.   Much improved! 
Papa Big Swig drove us back to the camper, and I’m too tired to even take a shower.  I washed off, put on PJ’s, and came to the lodge where there is WiFi to complete my journal entry.   WiFi/cell service may be an issue starting Sunday for a few days. If ever I’m not able to get an entry in, I will catch it up as soon as I possibly can.  
If my body will move tomorrow, I plan to put my boots back on.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587254,"We had breakfast at the lodge again this morning.  I filled up on a 3,egg omelette with breakfast potatoes and toast.  The lodge food is expensive and not anything special, we could do better at the camper.  That’s what we’ll do tomorrow. 
But, the  good thing about the lodge is that hikers are there.  I ran into two ladies who had been with me on Tray Mountain. That’s the time I was stuck for 11 hours in my tent with below freezing temps and 40MPH wind gusts. They are a mom & daughter duo.(Susan and Sam) can you imagine the memories being made right there? Anyway, we caught up on our adventures and discussed the upcoming Smoky Mountains. 
As usual Papa Big Swig drove me and Orlando to our starting location at Stecoah Gap.  A group of hikers from yesterday had already made their way to the gap and were sitting as a group eating breakfast. I’m glad it was in them to finish that climb this morning.  It really was a tough climb, but that view!  
My hike started up today. It was not a rough up. The temp and breeze made for a pleasant morning.  I enjoyed some new signs of Spring. Yellow, purple, and white flowers are beginning to pop up all over.  The mountains are coming to life. We saw a beaver this morning, a white tailed doe yesterday morning, and many busy birds. I’m really looking forward to lush green mountains hopping with wildlife.  A local in Stecoah let us know the bears are beginning to wake up now.  Two days ago a hiker had a bear encounter near the N.O.C.  Basically they just crossed paths without incident but he said he could have reached out and touched the bear.  
My hardest climb today was Jacobs Ladder.  Orlando wasn’t far behind me on this one. She hollered up to me asking if I knew the name of this mountain. At the time I didn’t.  She said “well I’ve got a name for it!”!  My grandchildren read this so I won’t share, but I laughed and laughed!!  I could picture Obi(my sister of the heart) saying the same thing... the whole way up!   So when I reached the summit of Jacobs Ladder I took advantage of that Verizon signal and called my friend.  I miss her terribly.  She told me she’s trying to match my miles from home in support of my hike.  I feel honored.  
I really hated to hang up the phone, but I had to get down off that mountain. Those winds get cold when you’re wet from sweating on the way up. Turns out the rest of my hike was mostly down. By 2:45pm I was at the parking area where Papa Big Swig was waiting.  
I built us a nice campfire and we roasted good ole Oscar Mayer wieners for supper.  I was not famished this evening like previous evenings.  I’m sure it’s directly related to having an easy hike today.  
After supper we grabbed a banana flavored Moon Pie and came here to the lodge where I can upload my journal.  We’re currently being serenaded by a guitarist who sings good old fashioned country music.  He can sing a story with the best of ‘em.  My dad would have loved this!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587394,"My alarm was set for 6:30 this morning.  I wanted to start early today because I had a 3pm chiropractor appointment one town over. My left hip has been bugging me.  We’ll see if this helps. I felt like he did a great job. It’s a challenge holding this 50+ years old body together!  
Orlando and I only had a little over 8 miles left to hike before we reached Fontana Dam and then it will be on to the Smokies.  That was our goal today.  As usual we started out going up, but like yesterday it wasn’t overly difficult. I enjoyed another pleasant day of hiking.   
My favorite 4 legged friend joined me again. This will be her last hike for at least 8 days.  Dogs are not allowed in the Smokies.  One of my readers recently asked her age. Seylor is 5 years old, and spoiled rotten!  She’s a rescue just like all of our dogs before her.  I highly recommend rescuing your next pet.  They know what you’ve done for them, and they don’t forget.  
After the first 3 miles this morning I started seeing glimpses of Fontana Dam between the trees. It felt like I should have been able to trot myself right on down there, but as you know the mountains don’t work like that.  I went around and down and around and down for 5 miles.  Every time I was on the Dam side of the mountain I wanted to stop and take a picture.  It was getting prettier and prettier as every loop brought me closer.  Today’s photo is of my first glimpse.  
I’m now officially out of the Nantahala National Forest.  I’ve really enjoyed North Carolina and everything Nantahala! Every  person I’ve had the pleasure of meeting while here was friendly and helpful.  Good people live in North Carolina.  
Speaking of good people.  There are a few good people I’ve been meaning to mention. First I really want to give a BIG thank you to Papa Monkey. I found him on Trail Journals last year.  He emailed back and forth with me a few times and offered up lots of valuable advice.  I think of him on a regular basis while I’m out there. Other hikers have helped too.  Maybe not via email but by sharing their journey, equipment information, hostel suggestions etc.  A few of them are 1st Sgt, Slip Knot, Hazel, Holcomb, Bunkie, and Legs.   I look up to each of them.  
Today was bittersweet. We met our goal of 8+ miles, but I’ll be starting the Smokies on Sunday without my friend Orlando.   Her sister picked her up today for a weekend in Hot Springs. I’m sure the trail will bring us together again, but for a while I’ll be at least one day’s hike ahead of her.   
I’ve reconnected with Hugs. She’s a day behind me, but since I’m taking a zero tomorrow we may be able to start the Smokies together.  I’ll be seeing her later tonight and we’ll figure it out.  Her plantar fasciitis is still a problem, but she’s determined! Hugs and Morrison will be tenting beside our camper tonight. I hope Seylor gets along with Morrison.  They met on the trail once and there was no growling...that’s a good sign I guess. We’ll see at 8pm when we pick her up at Stecoah Gap
Tomorrow is a zero for me.  I’ll be getting the big pack ready to go.  My princess hiking days are over again for a while. It sure has been nice!  
Lastly, I want to wish my grandson Logan a very happy 10th birthday!  You’re my little creative genius, and Nama loves you to the moon and back!  Break a leg buddy!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587558,"I woke up this morning in our little camper with hubby, our two dogs, Hugs, and her dog Morrison.  Somehow we made it work!   We’ll make it work tonight too. Jolly Rancher (aka J-Ranch) had pitched his tent behind our camper. He joined us for breakfast.  
Papa Big Swig treated us to gourmet oatmeal with blueberries and a side of turkey sausage. We started discussing careers, and it turns out J-Ranch is a chef.  I asked him if he has a specialty, and Papa Big Swig said “it better not be oatmeal”!  We all laughed!!  J-Ranch said he specializes in anything French.  He hit the Smokies today though so there’ll be no French cuisine for me.  
Today’s photo is of J-Ranch, Hugs, and Papa Big Swig after breakfast this morning.  
I started my day hiking(if you want to call it that) 4/10 of a mile from Fontana Dam picnic area to the visitors center.  Tomorrow I will start there. So officially today was a Nero, not a Zero!  
After my “hike” I spent the rest of the day preparing my gear to go into the Smoky Mountains tomorrow. I’m a little anxious about this for two reasons. 
Reason #1 
Thru-hikers pay $20 for a permit to hike the Smokies. In exchange for our $20 we get zero privies and last dibs on sleeping space in a shelter. Weekender’s and section hikers make reservations, and if there’s any space left we may take it.  However, if a late arrival with a reservation occurs we have to get out and set up our tent even if it’s midnight!  Here’s the catch... it’s mandatory to sleep in a shelter if there’s space.  So we’re not allowed to set up our tents until the shelter is full.  And the cherry on top is that we are given no more than 8 days to get entirely through the Smokies. If for any reason we are non-compliant  with any one of these rules we will be subject to a large fine.  
Reason #2
Bears!  In Georgia and North Carolina bears are hunted with dogs, so they have a fear of humans and they stay away. In Tennesse bears are protected. Over time they’ve come to learn where there are humans, there is food.  So in the smokies bears see us and think LUNCH!  I’m as prepared as I can be.  I have mace, a whistle, an air horn...and Jesus!  
In 2016 a hiker was using coconut oil on his feet every night, and while he slept,  a bear came up and took a bite right out of that hikers foot!  I plan to stink the whole way through.  No wet wipes, no toothpaste, I may not even brush my hair just for good measure! 
This evening we met a thru-hiker named Metric. He’ll be tenting behind our camper tonight.  We also met Big Kahuna another thru-hiker.  Metric will start the Smokies with me tomorrow. I’m not sure what Big Kahuna plans to do. Hugs and Morrison are staying the night, but will be coming off the trail for a while. Hugs hopes to heal up and re-join me later. 
I got a phone call from my son this evening. That was the best part of my day!!

Waiting there for us was a drop box where we each placed the bottom portion of our permits.  That’s it, I’m in the Smokies and there’s no turning back!  
The first 4 miles or so was up.  I’m back at sloth pace so Metric soon moved on. It took every inch of that 4 miles up for my body to readjust to wearing my big pack
A few sprinkles came down around 11am. I already had the rain cover on my pack, so I just slipped on a rain poncho and kept moving.  The rain really didn’t come then.  It was just a few drops.  
I hiked on with nice breezes until 1pm.  Still no rain, so I decided to pull up a nice log and  eat lunch.  First it was off with my boots and socks.  This practice is really working for my feet.  Just as I started looking through my food bag Awoken Ghost showed up and asked if he could join me.  I said “mi casa su casa” and made room on my log. Just as he pulled out his food the rains came. A torrential downpour right there in my dining room!  Very quickly we re-covered our packs, put on our rain gear, and I ate a kind bar.  Not much of a lunch.  
The rains came and went the rest of the day.  Mostly came.  
I hiked on alone.  There’s bear warnings all over the trail, so my eyes were on high alert lookout.  Suddenly, sitting a good distance down the mountain, there it was, a bear!  I was up on the ridge and he would really have to run up to get me, so I kept on going.  I watched him like a hawk though. He didn’t move at all as came up from behind him then had to cross in front of him to go up and away.  As I was just coming around the front I was able to get a better look at him, and turns out, it was a broken tree!  Not a bear at all.  
So I laughed at myself and kept on hiking. I was thinking about how to tell that story in my journal, when for real the largest bear head I’ve ever seen popped out of the woods about 15 yards in front of me! Then a shoulder and a ginormous paw!  My heart fell into my stomach. I stopped dead in my tracks and began walking backwards. He never even looked my way.  He just sauntered across the trail and made his way up the other side of the mountain.  I fumbled to get my phone for a photo but by the time I was brave enough to inch my way back over there he was gone.  I took a moment right then to thank Jesus.  
About that time another hiker came up behind me.  I was so glad to see someone!  I can’t remember his name.  It was something like Chief or Captain. We were 3 miles from the shelter. He slowed for me because he knew I was rattled.  He called it slow, but to me it felt like I ran for 3 miles up hill in the rain to get there.  He was an experienced outdoorsman and every time we turned a blind corner or were coming into a tight spot he would shout “YO” very loudly.  He says that way the bears know you’re coming and they move on.  
We arrived at the shelter.  It was full. I did see my friends Jamz, The Lady, and JRanch!  I can’t believe I passed JRanch!  He started yesterday into the Smokies. Anyway, the wind and rain would make setting up a tent difficult to say the least. We were only 3.3 miles from the next shelter.  We both grabbed water and he moved on ahead of me to get us a space.  I walked the 3.3 miles alone YO-YOing all the way there!   
When I arrived at shelter #2, it was full as well.  I did not see my new friend.  I was hungry, tired, and really felt defeated. Pan-Burger had made tacos.  Really it was rice and beans on a tortilla.  I think he felt bad for me, because he offered me a taco.  I gobbled that thing right up!  It was 2.9 miles to the next shelter.  It was already 5:30pm and I didn’t want to hike past dark.  But I had no choice.  So with a newly fueled body I YO-YOed all the way here to Spence Field Shelter.  You won’t believe it, but it’s full too!!  
Super cool people are here though.  They have a nice fire going, and they let me put my bag down on the dirt floor inside the shelter.   The wind is really whipping out there, but I’ll be ok here on the ground.  Now that I’m safe, I’m thinking about that bear.  I’ve decided they are truly majestic looking creatures.  He was so big but so graceful moving across that path.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587883,"When I woke this morning the lower 1/4 of my sleeping bag was drenched.  We had a tarp up, but the winds were so strong it blew the tarp letting rain come in.  There I was on the floor starting my day already wet and cold. 
I really wanted to hike all the way to Clingmans Dome today so I could get off the trail and out of this weather. Instead I set my sites on 13 miles to the last shelter before Clingmans Dome.  
With that in mind I went ahead and built a fire to try and dry out my sleeping bag before heading out. I didn’t get on the trail until 10am. That’s pretty late for a 13 mile day.  And you know I move at two speeds, SLOTH & SLOTHIER! 
Once I got out there and experienced the weather I knew my 13 mile day was a pipe dream.  The winds and rain were relentless. When I reached the top of Thunderhead Mountain at 5520ft elevation the wind gusts were so strong that I was nearly blown over twice. The rain now had little ice pellets in it. I felt like I was being pelted with BB’s.  My hands were numb.  I couldn’t get my fingers to work. I was barely able to turn loose of my trekking poles and adjust my worthless rain poncho.  Saying I was miserable is an understatement.  There I was struggling to stay on my feet, nearly in tears but far too exhausted to shed them.  I was physically and mentally drained. Somehow, eventually I inched my way down the mountain a little and around to the other side.  It was much less windy there, but still raining buckets of water. The trail had become a muddy river and before I knew it, I was all the way down in the mud.  For a brief moment I thought,  I physically just cannot get up. I’m going to stay down here and just pray that I wake up tomorrow.  But I’m not a quitter.  I had a moment of self pity , then my second wind came along. I told myself I’m stronger than this.  I made myself get up and I trudged on until I reached Derrick Knob Shelter.  I had hiked only 6.1 miles! 
As usual, the shelter was full.  Even the floor was taken. I sat there for a minute collecting my thoughts before I took off my wet clothes and changed into my sleeping clothes.  18 pairs of boots and shoes were around the fire.  Mine made 19.   I did not have a hot meal yesterday because I hiked so late, and I had eaten a cold breakfast this morning. Soon I decided to get out my Jet  Boil and heat water for a mountain house meal.  It was beef chili-Mac.  One of the guys on the top platform gave me some Parmesan cheese to put on it.  Food helped!  
I was now mentally prepared to go out there and set up my tent.  There was a lull in the rain so it was now or never.  Then suddenly G-Sharp said “Blue Raccoon, you take my spot”. Just like that he grabbed his gear and set up his tent. He was my trail angel today!   
I don’t know if he felt sorry for me or not. He said there were too many people in the shelter and he thought he would sleep better in his tent.  
It was only 5pm, but I climbed up in my sleeping bag and got warm.  The shelter had double decker platforms.  I was on the bottom. Being in my sleeping bag also kept me out of everybody’s way so they could cook and eat. I dozed off briefly.  Eventually every belly was full, all wet clothes were hung by the fire, backpacks were strewn everywhere, and we were no longer miserable.  
One of the hikers brought a Ukulele.  I can’t imagine choosing to carry a ukulele!  Im so glad he did though because soon the whole shelter was singing!  Another hiker was drumming on his abs and we were happy!   I enjoyed the party from my sleeping bag, but I sang along.  
Because of the wind and rain we crammed far more hikers into the shelter than it was intended for. Hikers were sleeping on the ledges at the end of the platform, and of course on the floor.  Literally my shoulders are touching the person on each side of me.  We were in our bags early because we are the old people section, cheering on the youngsters from the bleachers!  
Anyway, the guy to my right whose name I’ve forgotten says “ how could we ever explain this in the real world?”   I said explain what?  He goes on in so many words to say here we are wet, cold, and sleeping so tightly that we touch the shoulders of the people next us, and yet we’re currently having one of the happiest times of our lives.  It was true!   
I’ll never forget this day...I am stronger than I think, and Wake Up Flanagan is now my favorite campfire song!  
Wet boots will go back on tomorrow

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587923,"I had a much needed great night of sleep, and I woke up at 5:58am feeling refreshed and ready to go. I did wake up once through the night though. It was because of the noise from the wind and rain. I thought of G-sharp and prayed he was fairing well through it all.  
By 7:00am the winds became gentle breezes, and the rains were much lighter. I had peanut butter on a tortilla for breakfast. Then I quickly packed up and was on the trail to Clingmans Dome by 7:30. I knew Papa Big Swig would be waiting there for me at the parking area. I love that man!  
I wore my sleeping clothes to hike in today.  Everything else was soaked.  By the end of the day they were soaked too, but at least I started out dry.  Well, mostly dry. My boots were soaked. It didn’t matter anyway, I hiked through a lot of areas today where the path had become a stream.  Dry feet just wasn’t going to happen these past few days.  
It rained or misted all day, but the temp was good so I wasn’t cold.  I decided to enjoy this day.  Things are getting greener and it’s refreshing. I could actually smell the new foliage coming up all around me. 
It was almost lunch time when G-Sharp and Luna caught up to me. We were about 0.5 miles from the last shelter before Clingmans Dome.  We decided to stop there for lunch. I was out of water anyway so I had already planned to stop.  
Luna was noticeably younger than G-Sharp. I didn’t want to assume, so I asked if this was a father daughter hike...yes it was!  I was so happy for them, but for some reason it brought me to tears.  Right there I lost it. I had made it all the way through that mess yesterday completely dry eyed.  I explained they were happy tears, and that I was hiking in honor/memory of my dad. I reminded Luna to cherish this time.  That particular moment felt like a good time for me to go find the water source. I got my crying over-with out there, filled my liter bag and went back for lunch.  Zip Code told me I would cry on the trail. Today was my day I guess. 
I had mango-chipotle Salmon by Starkist for lunch. Mmmm delicious!  I’ll buy that again!  
There were 4.5 miles left to go when I started back out on the trail.  Suddenly I found myself in an evergreen forest with bright green lichen on the fallen logs.  It was beautiful and felt like a whole new forest.  
My phone was nearly dead so I didn’t take pictures. I keep my phone for Guthook only when the battery gets low. Just in case I make a wrong turn...again!  So the beautiful green forest is just another picture filed in the photo album of my mind. 
It was mostly evergreen forest for the rest of the way to Clingmans Dome.  This is the highest elevation of the entire Appalachian Trail at 6603ft.  Surprisingly it was not a torturous up.  I quite enjoyed the slow steady climb. The coolest thing about being up that high is literally walking in the clouds. There was a moment when I looked down and no bottom could be seen, just tree tops. It felt like if I were to jump, I would just fall forever like in a movie or something.  Of course I’m not THAT dumb.  No jumping for me! 
The trek down from the top took longer than it should have. All of this rain had turned the trail into flowing creeks.  At least these particular creeks had rocky bottoms so the water wasn’t muddy. I took that opportunity to somewhat clean my boots. Even still the rocks were slippery and I didn’t want to fall again, so “slothier” was my choice of speed. 
The path to the parking area was 0.6 miles of more up. I’ve decided the smokies are almost all up except immediately descending Clingmans Dome.  I know that can’t be exactly right but it sure feels that way.  
All of the ups didn’t matter when I saw Papa Big Swig waiting for me in the SUV with our fur babies. He also had Freaky Bee with him. She’s a hiker friend from Orlando’s original crew.  We drove straight into Gatlinburg.  
We took Freaky Bee to her hotel. Then Papa Big Swig made a quick run into 5 guys Burgers and Fries! Two Dr.Peppers and a burger later and I’m human again! Currently we’re in a warm hotel room with a lot of smelly gear!  Tomorrow will be laundry day. It doesn’t get any better than this!  
I haven’t completely said goodbye to North Carolina yet because the trail kind of bends and turns it’s away across the Tennessee-North Carolina boarder for maybe even a hundred more miles.  But with that being said, I would like to announce that I have now reached the 200 mile mark!!!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587971,"What happens on a zero day?  
First you sleep in if you can. I was awake at 5:30am but laid around until mid morning.  My knee is swollen so I kept it propped up on a pillow. When I started this big ole hike I knew that I would have to listen to my body.  Of my 5 original tramily members only 3 of us are still on the trail all because of injuries. Texas is working on a recovery and may be back to see us. Daddy Shakira doesn’t know his complete prognosis yet but says he’ll see us in Damascus for Trail Days.  I wish them both a quick journey back to good health!  
Of course one EATS while on a zero.  Actually one eats ALOT! I’m ashamed to tell you the amount of calories I’ve consumed today with plans for more!  
And then there’s laundry.  Papa Big Swig helps me out with that.  He let me rest my knee while he used the hotel laundry machine.  Turns out this was a bad move.  The rinse cycle doesn’t work, my clothing still smells, and my sleeping bag has a big hole in it. Feathers are everywhere!  He didn’t realize my sleeping bag could not go into a machine with an agitator.   
So the other thing one does on a zero day is go to the outfitters and  purchase replacement gear...$379 later I’m good to go. It’s expensive being a minimalist!  Several other hikers were at the outfitters as well. Papa Big Swig was able to see some video of our fun night in the shelter after a horrific day. Handstand was there and she showed him. She is a you tube video blogger. You can find her on You Tube’s “The Trek”. She said our party night videos will be available in a week or so. I suggest looking her up even before then.  I haven’t seen her blog yet, but I can only imagine that it’s pretty good.  
Since I’m planning to slackpack tomorrow, I’ll worry about getting my big backpack ready tomorrow evening.  When I take off on Friday It’s back in the Smokies for 4 days... not a day longer!  I will have met my obligations to the Smoky Mountain Authorities. 
I need to make some amendments to a couple of my previous entries. 

General is the name of my trail angel who stuck by me after the bear sighting. Not Chief or Captain.Pocketburger is the hiker who gave me a taco, not panburger.  It was also him who gave me the Parmesan for my chili-Mac.  Super nice guy! I also learned those winds were 50MPH when I was almost blown over twice.  
I think I’ll get a nap in before dinner.  We’re trying the Paula Dean restaurant. Word on the trail says it’s delicious!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588095,"I woke up early this morning after a poor night of sleep. Me and Papa Big Swig chose the complimentary hotel breakfast.  Papa Big Swig says they only have an 85% rating from the sanitation department. I guess that’s not so great. But hey I drink from creeks, so I took my chances. It was just a bowl of cereal and some OJ for me.  Then I ate half of Papa Big Swigs biscuit. 
Today I was a slackpacker. That means I could keep a good pace, struggle much less on the ups, and other thru-hikers were a little envious.  I really do feel bad when others ask if I’m a day hiker and I have to say no I’m a lucky slackpacker on a thru-hike.  I do know how fortunate I am!  We all need a Papa Big Swig in our lives. 
The first 15 minutes of my hike were with overcast skies, but no rain! Then as usual the rains came.  This seems to be the norm in the Smokies. 
By mile #3  I was emotionally resigned to the idea of another wet day. I had prepared myself with better rain gear this time. Proper planning pays! There were no winds either, so my mood was not hindered.  
The best thing about today was a continuous fragrance of evergreens. Ahhhhh!  It sounds crazy, but that smell is such a good feeling!  It’s possible for a smell to be a feeling, right?  I also saw some small wildlife. A couple of baby squirrels, and a chipmunk, lots of birds, and another turkey. Every day I see a turkey or two.  
My hike was mostly down today. Woohoo!  The trail has not yet recovered from this week’s torrential downpours.  I was hiking in either a mud trail or a creek trail most of the time. Except during the few ups.  So yes my boots are soaked again. 
I ate some snacks on the move today.  No real lunch break needed. I felt good as far as calories go.  Pretty sure the 10lb pack and very few ups had a lot to do with that.  
A hiker named Power caught up to me about midway through.  We hiked together a little over a mile before she left me in the dust...or mud as it were.  She’s 34 years old from Michigan.  When I heard her talk I knew she didn’t live too far from Illinois.  It was a small taste of the good old midwest home I love!  Anyway, she has blister issues too. A few days ago she changed her footwear to trail runners by Brooks. She’s a whole lot better now.  
I still have one blister that’s being stubborn.  Foot care is a grueling part of my daily routine.  So Papa Big Swig found a Merrell outlet in Seveirville.  I now own some trail runners by Merrell.  I can’t wait to give them a try as soon as I finish the Smokies. 
I only have 4 more days left of hiking in the Smokies. It’s a 4 day stretch with no way out until I finish.  I will start in the morning and should be done on Monday.  As before I may or may not be able to post journal entries while I’m in there.  I’ll do my best and promise to get caught up ASAP if I fall behind. 
The weather looks like it should be much better for this portion. Today’s rain ended with more of those little ice pellets. I was only in it about 25 minutes, but that was enough. 
Supper was a Victoria’s Filet from Outback, a baked potato and salad.  I’m stuffed! 
Today’s photo is (not so pretty) of me by the sign where I will head off into the woods tomorrow morning.  Only 1,972 miles to go...I got this!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588199,"My alarm went off at 6am, but I laid around another 15 minutes. It was really a good night of sleep and I didn’t want it to end!  But end it did and soon I was in the SUV with Papa Big Swig.  He was returning me to Newfound Gap where I would begin my journey into the last half of the Smoky Mountains.   
We arrived at the Gap about 8:10 am.  It had dropped to 38 degrees and the wind was blowing.  Dense fog obscured any potential views.  I was disappointed because the forecast did not prepare me for that.  Papa Big Swig hung around long enough for me to pull out my gloves and jacket and buff.  I really wanted to climb back into the front seat and go back to the motel. I’m on a time crunch though so I just had to do it. 
Despite the weather many locals were day hiking up to Charlie’s Bunion.  It’s a blue blaze view off the trail. I told myself I wasn’t passing up the views, so I started up there.  Then down came some locals who said don’t bother. The fog was too thick to see anything.  Another disappointment.  I had not yet seen a single view in the Smokies because of this weather.  
After Charlie’s Bunion there were no more local hikers to be seen. I did run into a few  section hikers and they were from Illinois!   One was a group of 3 guys doing a weekend thing, then at my shelter is a couple of guys also doing a weekend thing.  The guys at my shelter are firefighter/medics from Lake Zurich.  It was like a family reunion.  
Other than passing the section hikers I only saw two thru-hikers during the day. I was with one of them at 11:28am.  This is important to note, because at 11:28am the sun came out!!  The first sun I’ve seen in 5 days!  From that moment on it just got better and better.  
I saw views! Finally I can see the Smoky Mountains and all the beauty they hold. Still smiling right now!   The next two days look great too.  
So I hiked 10 miles to a shelter sign. When I got there the shelter itself was nearly a half mile off trail.  The two other thru-hikers I had seen today were sitting there contemplating if they should go on to the next shelter(5 miles)or hike the 0.5 miles off the trail.  We all decided to hike on.  I took the lead.  About a half mile later I decided I really didn’t want to do the 5 miles, so I turned around.  I’m really glad I did! 
This shelter is set up for folks on horseback.  It’s very unique.  I love it! It also comes with a privy!  Who knew?  There weren’t suppose to be any privies in the Smokies.   This is just whipped cream and a cherry on top! 
I had a Mountain House meal of turkey and stuffing for dinner. It was delicious,  and washed down nicely with my crystal light lemonade.  Sugar wafer cookies for dessert, and I’m fat and happy!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588367,"I was awake before the sun came up this morning.  It was 5:45am.  Having slept in the shelter, I used my headlamp to collect my things and go outside to start packing up.  I tried not to wake others.  It’s nearly impossible. By the time I changed into my day clothes, ate breakfast, and brushed my teeth it was about 7:30am. I put my pack on and started hiking.  
Pecks Corner Shelter was almost a half mile off the trail.  I went down coming in so that meant I was going up to get out.  By the time I actually got to the real trail the sun was in full view.  I could tell I was in for a fabulous day!   
Yesterday I had a near fall. I saved myself with my trekking poles and my left knee.  I knew I had strained my knee then which is why I chose not to go the extra 5 miles yesterday afternoon.  I rested it last night, but this morning it was even worse.  So I planned to go slow.  
Only 5 miles into my hike was a shelter.  I decided to stop, rest my knee, and have an early lunch.  It was just me and a squirrel for about 20 minutes before another hiker with the same idea stopped by.  Her name is Honey Bear.  She’s a traveler cardiovascular nurse so we had plenty to talk about.  I stayed there way too long!   
I still had 7 miles to go when I left from lunch, but only 3 more miles up the trail was an open grassy area with the most spectacular view. I had to stop!  I dropped my pack and kicked back enjoying the sun and the view.  The view is today’s picture.  It’s Saturday so there were several weekend and section hikers out. I had great conversations with all of them.  Last year when I was imagining how my hike would be, a day like today is what I pictured.  
The next 3 miles were...DOWN!  Can you believe it?!? I enjoyed a relaxing hike almost all the way to the shelter. And there were views nearly the entire time.  
I had already decided I was going to pitch my tent tonight. So there was no rush to get a shelter space.  I just decided to enjoy my day.  Zen is the only word I can find right now. 
Today marks 1 month since starting my hike.  I’m at mile marker 230.7.  Supposedly I need to average 10 miles a day to make it to Katahdin by fall.  I’m almost 70 miles behind.  Mostly it’s due to the weather, so almost everybody is in the same boat.  I would like to be able to increase my daily mileage in Virginia.  I’m hoping Vern, one of my readers, can give me some insight on making up the miles.  He knows the trail and gives good advice. 
Speaking of readers.  Once again I have to say thank you to everybody who leaves messages in my guestbook. I do read every single one of them.  It’s like getting a special surprise every time!  Thank you thank you!  
Supper was a Mountain House beef stroganoff meal.  It wasn’t my favorite, but I drank hot chocolate with it.  Chocolate makes everything yummy! 
Well it’s now close to 8pm.  That’s what we call hikers midnight.  I wish I could say my knee is better, but it’s not.  Sadly,  it’s the one that used to be my good knee.  Hoping a good nights sleep in my tent will give it what it needs to feel better.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588429,"Last night I basically stealth camped. It was somewhat within the shelter area, but across a creek and down a hill next to the woods.  I chose that spot because the view of the mountains from there was breathtaking.  Also, I’m over the whole sleeping in a shelter thing.  They are great if the weather is bad, but if it’s nice outside I prefer my own little space. 
Off to the side of my tent I created a living room.  My living room was basically made up of a contractor sized trash bag and my thermalite sit-upon.  It was a perfect spot for me to relax and journal while basking in all of the natural beauty around me. 
I slept like a baby!  One time I woke up to pee.  I’m only telling you this because I put on my crocs and walked to the nearest tree. That’s another great thing about stealth camping, you don’t have to worry about being seen.  Anyway, I went back to my tent and took off my crocs before putting my feet inside.  Somehow one slipped out of my hand and went rolling down the hill!  Ugh!  I thought about it for 2 seconds before I zipped my tent shut and went right back to sleep.  
My alarm clock today was the song of morning birds. I heard them chirping and the sun was just beginning to rise.  It was time to sit in my “living room” and watch it happen. I grabbed my bear bag and runaway shoe before I sat down. I ate breakfast while watching the show. Today’s photo is of this mornings glorious sunrise. I feel so blessed!  
My knee felt much better this morning, but I’m still taking things slow. It was nearly 8:30am before I was packed up and ready to go.  Then I had quite a hike just to get back to the shelter and eventually the trail.  
I only had 7.9 miles of hiking left to exit the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Papa Big Swig would pick me up at Davenport Gap.  I was a little sad because now that the weather is good, I’m loving the Smokies! 
My hike was fairly uneventful today. I started with a large up, but the last 4 miles were down.  Oftentimes it was a solid trail of rocks, but it was down.  I frightened a black snake with my trekking pole. It accidentally landed right on him. He slithered up the grassy side of the trail and gave me an I’m aggravated look!  He was sticking his tongue out even.  I’m confident he wasn’t hurt though because I had no weight on my pole at the time.  I uploaded a picture of him.  It’s not a great photo, but he was about 4ft long. 
Before I knew it my Great Smoky Mountain adventure had come to an end. The first half of the mountains was a bear (tee-hee), and the second half was awe inspiring. 
The class of 2016 thru-hikers left trail magic for us at the park exit. It was a cooler with our choice of pop, beer, or Gatorade, and chips or candy.  They had written messages on the cooler congratulating us on completing the Smokies and cheering us on to Maine. I chose a fully loaded Coke and some Cheetos. Then just as Papa Big Swig arrived I grabbed a Twix.  There’s something special about candy when you’re on the trail.  
Papa Big Swig dropped me off at the camper and left for Black Mountain to pick up Hugs. She’s back!!!  It’s a happy sad moment. Turns out it’s not just plantar fasciitis. She has a fractured  calcaneous!  That’s a heel bone for my non medical readers.  It’s a rare thing to fracture that bone. Her hiking days are basically over and we’re both sad.  I say basically because I’m going to do a little leap frog with her and we’re planning to take a short hike and spend the night at Max Patch mountain under the stars on Tuesday.  Yes she’s doing this with a fracture! That was one of the things on her to do list for her thru-hike so we’re making it happen.  She’ll be saying goodbye for good on Wednesday, and I’ll miss her smiling face. 
To my surprise I had an early Mother’s Day package waiting for me in the camper from my girls.  They both put a lot of thought into my gifts.  It brought me to tears.  I often think of my children when I’m hiking.  I’m so proud of the wonderful human beings all of my children have grown up to be.  I’m a lucky mom!  
Not sure if I’m hiking big miles or little miles tomorrow. My left knee is swollen again and quite painful to touch. Either way, my boots will be back on.

I chose to do a Nero up to Standing Bear Farm.  Papa Big Swig will pick me up there. 
It’s the coolest hostel ever!  A hiker had rolled his ankle and needed picked up down by the trail, so Papa Big Swig was his trail angel while I toured the hostel.  Today’s photo is a group of hikers sitting around the fire at Standing Bear.  
There are a few places where hikers can choose a bunk at Standing Bear. The bunk rooms are big and tidy.  One has a pot bellied stove in it.   There’s a picnic table on the patio and hikers sign their name on it.  There’s a fire ring, a place to order pizza, beer or pop, and it seems they do a lot on the honor system. The decor really makes it special.  There’s old hiker boots being used as flower pots, and homemade wooden signs. I even saw a library! Oh and of course showers and privies!  
Meanwhile, Big Kahuna arrived at our campsite!  Papa Big Swig made all of us stuffed salmon with sweet potatoes and green beans for supper. As usual it was delicious!!  Then the 4 of us(me, Papa Big Swig, Hugs, and Big Kahuna)played a little Texas Hold’em.  It was a fun night.  
Tomorrow morning I’ll be hiking a leap frog.  That means  I’m going to jump ahead and do a special section with Hugs before she leaves.  I’ll come back and hike the part I skipped on Thursday. Then on Friday I will pick up where Hugs and I left off.  Big Kahuna will be hiking with us.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588686,"I woke up this morning to a water leak in our camper. Papa Big Swig could not find the source of the leak.  Water was dripping from what appeared to be the bottom of the fridge.  Ugh...double ugh! 
Then I remembered Big Kahuna is a plumber. He came over around 7:30am for breakfast and coffee, but he went straight to work instead. He found a false wall under our sink and had our leak fixed in no time.  It was not the fridge at all.  I am so grateful and happy!   
Realizing we were doing a Nero again today we decided to wait until after lunch to start our hike. Hugs treated us to burgers and onion rings at a cute little greasy spoon. It was a perfect meal to get us started up to Max Patch! 
This is a leap frog for me. I’ll have to go back and fill in the gap on Thursday.  Tomorrow will be another Nero so I can say goodbye to Hugs.  
On the way to our starting point we saw a big hawk and a mama bear with 2 cubs.  They were cute fat little butterballs running up the mountain! 
Max Patch Mountain is a bald at 4601ft elevation.  We pitched our tents, but I plan to cowboy camp. My sleeping bag is outside and on the ground.   After this amazing sunset I’ll look up at the stars all night.  A sunset photo is your featured photo of the day. Just in case I do end up in my tent, my door is positioned to catch the sunrise.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588801,"It happened!  I fell asleep looking at thousands of stars in the night sky. I haven’t seen stars so clearly in a long long while. Hugs and I both looked at each other and said “it’s magical”...and it really was. Cowboy camping is so much fun!   
Big Kahuna woke me up about an hour or so before sunrise.   We were positioned on the right side of the mountain to watch the colors in the sky changing. There were brilliant pinks and oranges and sometimes purples and blues as the sun became a round ball of light all the way up over Max Patch.  What a way to start the day!  
Big Kahuna served Hugs and I breakfast in bed.  Peanut butter on a bagel filled us up, and tasted yummy while we watched the new day come to life.   Birds began chirping. Day hikers, thru-hikers, Golden Retrievers and more were starting to move around the bald.  It was something to see.  
I had my dad in my heart this morning.  I hope he really does get to see these things with me. He would be grinning from ear to ear.  Last night the three of us ate some creme drops(one of his favorite candies) and toasted him with them.  
It was planned for Papa Big Swig to pick us up at”Abandoned Road”. around 9am.  This was less than 2 miles from the summit of Max Patch.  That’s more than enough hiking for Hug’s who has a fractured foot! 
Oh if only that were the end of the story! 
For starters when we reached Abandoned Road we thought we had 0.2 miles left to go.  I didn’t question that because Abandoned Road really looked like an abandoned road.  No way could he have driven up there to get us!  So 0.5 miles later there was a shelter with a privy.  Perfect timing for me!  When I came out of the privy Hugs said we were a half mile past Abandoned Road!   Guess what? Abandoned Road really was an abandoned road!  
Of course there was no reliable cell service. We had no idea where Papa Big Swig was at. We decided to walk back the 1/2 mile and go from there.  
Big Kahuna took lead down the abandoned road in hopes there would be a gate.  We did not go far before we heard Papa Big Swig yelling “YO”!  Yes, Papa Big Swig was talking to the bears.  We walked a little over a mile down the abandoned road and met up with Papa Big Swig.  Yes there was a gate.  All of this hiking, and I only get credit for 1.4 miles. 
Lesson learned.  When  it says Abandoned Road on Guthook, it really is an abandoned road!  
Hugs’ foot was pretty sore, but she says it’s better now.  Big Kahuna is treating us to a steak dinner. We’ll play cards after we eat, and that will end my time with Hugs and Big Kahuna.  We’re all going different directions, but we plan to meet back up in Damascus for trail days.  I can’t wait to see EVERYBODY old and new in Damascus...it’s right around the corner.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588943,"Hugs is on her way to some R&R in Belize. Her foot really does need to heal. Big Kahuna went back to finish the last half of the Smokies, and I had 10.1 miles to make up that I had skipped for our night on Max Patch Mountain. I will miss them, but we all have to hike our own hike. 
I woke up around 7am( late for me)and had breakfast at the RV park store. Today was the first time they’ve ever served breakfast.  I had bacon egg & cheese biscuit with a hash brown and chocolate milk.  It was ok.  They asked if anything could be better, so I kindly answered honestly.  Tomorrow I need to get out very early, but we’ll try their breakfast again on Saturday.  
After breakfast Papa Big Swig took me back to Brown Gap and I hiked a 10.1 miles Flip Flop to Standing Bear.  My favorite little 4 legged hiker joined me.  
It was hot out there today.  Flying insects were all over the place! I had failed to bring my repellent, so I just had to keep on moving.  If I stopped for even 5 seconds my face was swarmed with hundreds of little gnat things that bite!   
Slack-packing is both a blessing and a curse.  It’s a blessing because I get to hike with 1/3 the weight as a full pack, but it’s a curse because things get missed or forgotten from my big backpack to my little day pack.  Also, my hiking distances must be predetermined for Papa Big Swig to pick me up. So I can only hike to places where there is close by automobile access. There’s usually some random road crossing within 15 miles of any beginning point, but not always.  Even with the inconveniences, it’s nice to carry less weight! 
While I did not enjoy the gnats at all, I did enjoy watching the very busy bumblebees!    I’m fascinated by them.   There are also many fuzzy caterpillars right now, and quite a few butterflies too.  More and more colors are popping up.  The newest are red flowers, trees with a lilac type bloom on them, and the white dogwoods. I have not seen any rhododendron blooms yet but they can’t be too far away.  
Today the trail was a pretty even mixture of ups and downs. The terrain had its moments, but overall was a reasonably level dirt path.  That’s a hikers delight!   
At one point I hiked past a futuristic looking building out there in the middle of the mountains. I decided it’s probably some kind of power source because there were lines coming down from it.  I just can’t imagine what on earth it would be powering way out there.  
Before I knew it Seylor and I popped out onto the gravel road that goes to Standing Bear Hostel. This is where Papa Big Swig picked us up.  It was a fast hike, but we’re both worn out.  Seylor is especially worn out as she had spent a lot of energy trying to rid the world of squirrels and chipmunks.  
We ordered pizza for an early supper since I really had no lunch. Then it’s shower time, and we’re going to play BINGO at the pavilion tonight.  
My boots will be back on tomorrow

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589073,"I was up and at’em early this morning. Had to go back to the chiropractor before hitting the trail. He was pretty speedy so I didn’t lose much time. 
Seylor and I started our hike today at Abandoned Road around 9:00am.  It was over a mile hike in before I even got to the trail.  But the rule is to start back where I left off...so I did.  
When I came up to that privy I had used the other day, I stopped and used it again.  There were 3 hikers still hanging around the shelter there. We chatted for a minute about a fire by Hot Springs.  Then I hiked on.  From that moment until the end of my hike I never saw another soul. 
I’m currently hiking Mt Pisgah National Forest. The terrain is definitely less rocky than it was in the Smokies.  I like that, but the tree roots can be just as treacherous.  I managed to roll my ankle on a tree root today.  I went all the way down to the ground, but was able to avoid a sprain.  
That brings me to my shoes.  This is day #2 with my trail runners.  I did buy them a half size bigger as suggested by Vernon, one of my readers. It was great advice. My feet are happy in these shoes!  I’ll keep my boots around for Rocksylvania, but for now it’s trail runners.   I’ll be buying some Gators at the outfitters tomorrow to keep rocks and dirt out.  
Just before my fall, I saw a large winged shadow coming from overhead.  I looked up to see a red tail hawk circling above.  He had his eye on something!  I saw a deer today too.  It was another doe.  I have no idea how an animal as big as a deer can run through all of that brush and briar, but it sure did.  
The weather has become warm. Even hot at times.  There were several ups today and I did my fair share of sweating. Even with a day pack, it’s a workout!  Me and Seylor both drank lots of water. 
My biggest climb today was Bluff Mountain at 4680 ft elevation.  It was the last climb of the day, then I enjoyed about a mile of downhill.  That was nice.  
I planned to end my hike today at Garenflo Gap.  It’s a good thing that was my plan because the rest of the trail to Hot Springs is closed due to fire. There is now a 7 mile detour. A forestry official was stationed at Garenflo Gap to redirect us.  I’ll start back on the trail in Hot Springs on Sunday. 
I hope it wasn’t an unattended campfire that started this.  A good rule of thumb is not to leave your campfire until you can place your hand in the ashes.  
I’ll be taking a zero tomorrow.  Papa Big Swig is relocating our camper to the Lazy Llama  Campground in Chuckey TN, and I’ll be visiting the Bluff Mountain Outfitters.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589206,"I slept in this morning until 7:30am.  My body is aching all over.  I guess the steep ups with hot weather yesterday took its toll on me.  Even my dog is lacking a little pep in her step.  Good thing I had already planned for a zero today.  
Papa Big Swig spent this morning packing up the camper. Before noon we took off for Lazy Llama Campground in Chuckey, Tennessee. I must confess, I napped most of the way.  It’s not the best campground but very nice people own and operate it.  Sometimes lack of amenities can be overlooked when you’re showered with kindness.  That’s the case here.  
Orlando and Big Kahuna were hiking in the Smokies until today. They are not hiking together, but they aren’t far apart either.  Anyway, last night both of them had bear problems. They closed down Orlando’s shelter due to aggressive bear activity.  Looking back, I do think it’s awesome that I pretty much came face to face with a bear in the wild. However, once in a lifetime is enough for me!    Glad to be out of the Smokies.  
I made it to an outfitters in Johnson City this afternoon. They had a compression stuff sack for my Nemo sleeping bag,  but no ankle height gators.  I’ll check in Hot Springs tomorrow.  That’s where I originally wanted to go anyway.  
The weather here is iffy.  Rain and thunderstorms are coming and going in waves. It’s expected to continue all week long.   I have no choice.  if I’m going to make it to Maine on time, I will be hiking in the rain tomorrow....and all week.  
We had Mexican food for supper.  It was a restaurant called Amigos recommended to us by the RV park owner.  Winner winner chicken dinner!  Well winner winner Tamale dinner!  
My photo tonight is from Max Patch a few days ago.  It’s of me playing backpack soccer with a soccer ball Big Kahuna found on the side of the mountain.  I was really just being goofy.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589339,"I slept in late again this morning hoping to let the rain pass.  It was still cloudy, but no rain when I finally got started about 11:45am.  There was a shuttle taking us from Garenflo Gap to Hot Springs NC. because of the fire.  I chose to take the Papa Big Swig shuttle instead. 
We made a quick pit stop at Bluff Mountain Outfitters. I was thrilled to see a large selection of Dirty Girl Gators.  No more dirt and pebbles in my trail runners!   
Buying my Dirty Girls made me think of Daddy Shakira. He’s the one who first introduced me to them. I had planned to text him this evening. It’s strange how things happen, because as soon as I turned my phone on after hiking there was a message from him.  He bought his plane ticket for Damascus today. I really do look forward to seeing my original Tramily.  It’s been a while. 
Just as I got myself ready to start walking, the rains came again.  I put on my raincoat and left out from the southern most point of Hot Springs. I followed trail signs right down the center of town. It’s a very small town, but the community really serves us hikers well. 
The signs led across a bridge over French Broad River.  I hopped onto the real trail there. It runs parallel to the river for about a quarter of a mile or so. The river made me wish I had my kayak with me.  She was a swift river with a few small rapids. So inviting!  
About 30 minutes into the woods the rain quit falling...never to return. That was a gift!  Seylor hiked with me again today. She doesn’t mind her wet dog smell, but I sure do!  
There were several tents set up along the river.  A few folks had their dogs tenting with them. Seylor doesn’t always do well with other dogs, but surprised me today and did just fine.  
There were also two big signs posted near the river protesting a pipeline being considered in Virginia.  I’m understanding that if the pipeline goes in it wil affect the A.T.   I need to do some research on this.   
My first climb was up and away from the river.  It was a never ending doozy! Nothing too bad came after that though. I ran into two thru-hikers up there at Lovers Leap. They were Danimal and Jess.  We had some quick chit chat and covered for each other to potty. I took a couple of photos up there. Today’s featured photo is of French Broad River from Lovers Leap.  
Shortly after lovers leap the terrain changed.  The path became wide and oftentimes was soft with fallen pine needles. There was a mild fragrance of pine in the air too. Those things combined made for a pleasant hike.  
Shortly I came upon a dam wall. I hiked up the hill to find it was holding back a small pond.  To this minute I don’t see a benefit from holding that water back. But anyway, Seylor immediately decided that pond was her swimming pool. So much for no more wet dog smell!  
We hiked on and the trail turned into a grassy field.  Eventually I walked on a dirt road up around and through the field for about a half mile. This area used to be tobacco and hay fields.  The Forest Service purchased it in 1970 and now it’s a brood area for turkeys and grouse. I see and hear a lot of turkeys and grouse every day. I guess the brood area is working! The space really was beautiful to see, but all I could smell were ramps.  Ramps are wild onions, and they are pungent! 
I had a nice wide path most of the rest of the day.  When I had about 2 miles left I met a couple of day hikers who had seen a bear in the exact area I was heading to.  It didn’t even rattle me.  I made sure my mace was accessible, and I hiked on yoyo-ing all the way!  I never did see a bear.  
When I made it to Hurricane Gap I waited about 5 minutes and Papa Big Swig arrived with my chariot. He had made ham and beans in the crockpot for dinner. My belly is full and my heart is happy!  I’m one lucky girl! 
I’ll be getting my big pack ready tonight, because tomorrow I’m setting out for a few days.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589530,"Papa Big Swig dropped me off early this morning at Hurricane Gap. You know the saying “the early bird gets the worm”?   Well the early hiker gets the cobwebs!   I spent the first hour spitting and sputtering. Cobwebs were on my face, in my mouth, and on my clothing.  Yuck!  About an hour in I met a section hiker southbound who said she had been doing the same thing.   We were both happy to know the other had already cleared the trail ahead for each of us.  
Speaking of trail, it was almost all up today. It was hot, and I had a tough day physically. I liken it to 8 hours on a stair master with no air conditioner.  
Even on the hard days though  I try to make it a point to look for Gods creatures. I saw a very large red headed woodpecker.  I bet that bird was a foot tall, or more!  I saw my second snake.  She was a beauty!  She even stopped to pose for a photo.  I named her Georgia since she seemed to be a SOBO.  
I had decided to get on the trail early this morning because it was suppose to storm this afternoon. I planned to hike about 10 miles in to a shelter, stay there while the storm passed,  and move on. The storm never came.  
I spent way too much time at the shelter.  I cooked a full meal. It was an odd time of day to eat but I was watching the clouds and hoping for rain.  Eventually the conversation got a little heated.  Not really heated, but touchy. It was late afternoon but I didn’t want to be in or watch an argument so I decided to leave.  
It was still hot when I took off. The first mile was up.  It took me forever to conquer that mile!  In the mean time a couple of hikers who had heard part of that conversation decided to leave too. They caught me before I was all the way up. This heat has zapped me and I knew I did not have enough energy to go 7.3 miles to the next shelter.  I think they were feeling the same.  We picked a place along the trail and set up camp. 
I’m in the Cherokee National Forest now and tenting beside the Pounding Mill Trail. 
I’m very cognizant of my water intake on days like these, but I still got over heated!  I was actually a little disappointed there was no storm.  It would have cooled things off.    I’ve got to come up with a good plan for when REAL summer comes.  
Camp tonight is with Kaitlin and Taylor.  They are a blast!   We built a campfire and laughed a lot while sitting around it.  Neither of them have a trail name yet. I’m trying to think of something good!  
I’ll think on that as I fall asleep tonight.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589610,"Last night I slept well, but some time in the  night a bird of some sort decided to hang out by my tent. I know it was a big bird because I could hear the wings flapping. Loudly!  At first I thought it had to be a turkey, but I don’t think turkeys are nocturnal.  Now I’m thinking maybe an owl?  Whatever it was, it only kept me awake a couple of minutes.  
When I finally woke up to stay awake, I could hear S.P.(aka Kaitlin) moaning.  She had been awake for a while, and she was sick.  Chameleon(aka Taylor) was there to help her, but I hated leaving.   I hope she’s better. 
I needed a water refill after making hot chocolate with breakfast. Breakfast was a tortilla with almond butter. There was a creek just under a mile ahead, so I said my goodbyes and left for some water. 
 Hiking to the creek was down a nice wide path.  I dropped my pack when I got there and commenced  to collecting water. When I looked up toward the hill/boulder where the stream flowed out I saw a bunny rabbit. It was nestled up under the brush. She sat statue still but watched me the whole time.  It didn’t take long for me to realize she was covering the opening to her nest. I could hear little squeaks coming from behind her.  I’m sure my presence scared the bejeepers out of her, but she was a brave mama protecting her babies.  I took a quick picture, and named her Merida.  
The next half mile or so was more of the same. I enjoyed a nice wide path, and noticed fuzzy dandelions popping up all over.  I also saw the most beautiful bird. It was bright orange with black wings. I’ve got to look that up and figure out what kind it is.  I’m thinking possibly an Oriole. He was too fast for a photo.  
Starting around mile number two, today’s hike got real!  The terrain up to Firescald Knob was tough!  At times even dangerous.  It was all boulders up to 4530ft elevation. At one point I had to climb up a large boulder.  I tossed my trekking poles up there and began to pull myself up. Above where I was climbing to, another boulder jutted out. I failed to consider the extra space my backpack would need above me.   You guessed it!  I jumped up there and the boulder above caught my backpack sending me right back down. I was a little shook up, but not hurt.  I took my backpack off and tossed it up there before my second attempt. It was a tough 3 miles of boulder climbing, but the rewarding view from the top was worth it! I sat up there and ate some candy while I  soaked it all up. 
One nice thing about that big climb is that it was really well shaded.  The sun was bright when I started up but those rhododendrons kept me comfortable.  
Just as I was coming down the sky started changing. It was getting dark.  In a short time sprinkles were falling.  I was within a mile of a shelter so instead of dropping pack to get out my rain gear, I made a mad dash for it. Just as I reached the shelter the skies let loose.  Perfect timing! 
I waited around 20 minutes or so at the shelter.  It went back to sprinkling so I put on my rain gear and hit the trail...which was up.  At the top the trail opened up into another beautiful grassy field.  By the time I made it up there the skies were clear again. I dropped my pack one last time to put away my rain gear.  Hiking in plastic really makes me sweat. 
Yesterday’s hopes became today’s reality.  The rains did come, and they cooled things down for a comfortable rest of the day. 
I had one more rocky climb.  It was called Big Butt Mountain!  I had to laugh!  Who names these mountains?  Big Butt came with a blue blaze bypass. Apparently Firescald Knob did too. But I’m true to the thru, so I stayed on the white blaze for both of them.  Big Butt was a climb, however, she was short and sweet. 
It was getting late, and I still had about 4 miles to get to Devils Fork Gap. This is where Papa Big Swig was waiting for me. The big climb and rain put me behind, but he didn’t complain a bit.  He was handing out trail magic to thru-hikers while he waited.  
I reached the 300 mile mark today!  And on the way to the camper  there was a rainbow. I’m going to chalk this up as another great day!  
I think I’ll post my picture of Merida the bunny rabbit tonight(because she’s cute), but look through all of my photos and check out the views and terrain.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589757,"I woke up early, had breakfast, and got ready to go. Papa Big Swig drove me to my starting point at Devils Fork Gap.  Even though it’s not that many miles, it still took an hour to get there.  Driving AROUND mountains just takes time. 
It’s been on my mind that I need to get more miles in if I’m going to make it to Katahdin on time.  So I decided to hike 22 miles today.  No putzing around! 
From the gap, I started my hike going up.  It wasn’t a big up, and soon I was ridge hiking.  My favorite!  I passed a few hikers who were still breaking down camp. I should have kept walking but you know me, I had to chat a little with everybody.  It’s what I do! 
The trail winded down to a little waterfall. It was nice and cool there.  I stood for a while just listening to the water.  I love the sound of flowing water.  It’s so soothing. Soon I started hiking my way back up the trail from the other side of the waterfall.  I hiked alone the next 5+ miles.  
A lot happens in 5 miles. For example those  ginormous bumblebees! They are still very busy.  It has become normal for me  to have a Bumblebee buzzing around my head about every 10 minutes.  I’ve decided they have work zones.  It’s the strangest thing.  These bees fly around in circles, that’s why they circle my head.   They go around 2 or 3 times before I’ve walked out of their respective zone.  Then 5 or 10 minutes later another bee does the same thing until I’ve walked out of its zone and so on. There’s always only one bee at a time, and they always fly in circles.  The other thing about these bees is their buzz!  It’s soooo loud!  They sound like the Stearmen Fly-in. That’s a big deal event in my hometown Galesburg, Illinois.  
There’s an Asian hiker I’ve noticed the last couple of days. We played leap frog a few times, and ended up having lunch together at a shelter. His English is very broken, and my Japanese is nonexistent!  Despite the barriers we managed to have a pleasant conversation.  His trail name is Sunrise. He’s here for 6 months to hike. After Trail Days he’s taking no zeros and hiking about 16 miles a day so he’s sure to get to Katahdin He gifted me a piece of Japanese oregami paper.  When my hike is over I’m going to try to make a  crane out of it.  
There were two local gentlemen at the shelter as well. Both were very nice They are retired and it seems they frequently enjoy little day hikes.  One of them suggested I take a blue blaze to High Rock for the view.  I know time is an important factor, but I’m doing this to soak up every ounce of beauty I can, so I took the blue blaze.  It was beautiful, and really didn’t cost me too much time.  
On my way to the blue blaze one of those beautiful orange birds flew right in front of me.  It landed on a low branch right there on the side of the trail. I grabbed my phone, unlocked it, and took aim.  Just as I was ready to snap the photo it flew down the side of the mountain to a different tree. It wasn’t too far down there so I dropped my pack and poles and went down.  I took careful aim, and it flew off again!   It just wasn’t meant to be.  Lesson learned, a little ways down feels like a long ways back up!  Just a little more time was lost.  
I walked on alone for a long while after the blue blaze.  There were a lot of butterflies today.  Suddenly, like in a movie,  a swirl of 10 or 15 butterflies came up and around me. They were all black with royal blue edges on their wings.   Just as quickly as they came, they were gone.  
I was getting close to Big Bald when Honey Bear came up from behind me. I have not seen her since the smokies.  It’s funny how some people stick with you. She said she had been thinking about me and wondered how I was doing.  We talked about feeling a little pressure to put in more miles.  She had recently talked with stripes who said during her thru-hike in 2016 she knew people only at Standing Bear during Trail Days who still made it to Katahdin.   I’ve got hope. 
Big Bald was my tallest climb of the day at   5504 ft elevation.  I love climbing a bald!   It’s like climbing up a huge grassy field.  I took my time to see the view from all the way around the top.  So beautiful!  There was about 5 other hikers up there doing the same. 
When I was coming down off of Big Bald I still had 6.9 miles to make 22 miles today.  It was after 6pm and I would have been hiking until after 10 o’clock. I had cell service so I called Papa Big Swig.  We made a plan B.  It took some creative driving on his part, but  he got me.   I think tomorrow I’m going to have to climb Big Bald again in order to get back on track.  That’s ok with me.  
I only hiked 15.4 miles total. The saying on the trail is “last one to Katahdin wins”.  I think I could win this!

There was a lot going on this morning.  For starters, we had given Biscuit a ride on Tuesday and she accidentally left her Sawyer Squeeze in our SUV.  She’s back on the trail today, and needs her Sawyer to filter water. She was my primary concern.  Through Papa Big Swig we were planning to meet at Big Bald Mountain this morning.  
That leads to problem number two. The road to Big Bald is on guarded private property. The HOA is not hiker friendly. We tried a path that would only give me 4 extra miles to walk, but it was gated and padlocked.  Ugh!
In our frenzy of driving back and forth we saw a hiker coming down into Sam’s Gap. He didn’t cross over to head back up but rather started hiking down the road.  We pulled over to see what’s going on.  Turns out he’s a thru-hiker catching a flight home for the weekend out of Asheville. So Medicine Man(a pharmacist) hopped in.  But before anybody was going to Asheville I had to get to Big Bald and start hiking. It was 10:30 already and I hadn’t taken a step.  
I believe God puts people in our lives just when we need them.  Medicine Man had the solution to our problem!  He knew of a hostel that provides a shuttle service to Big Bald.  I called, and soon Fred from Mother Marion’s Hostel was picking me and Seylor up.   Turns out he lives on Big Bald and he shuttles us through because he can!   I was so grateful!!
At last I was at the north side base of Big Bald. This is exactly where I had ended yesterday’s hike.  
Now to find Biscuit. There is great cellular service there so I sent her a text.  Before she could respond it started to sprinkle. I sent another text that it was sprinkling, and I was hiking to Big Bald Mountain Shelter about a mile away.  She responded “I’m at Big Bald Mountain Shelter”!  Perfect! In no time Seylor and I were there.  The case of the misplaced Sawyer Squeeze resolved! 
Just as we got there it started raining a little heavier.  Not too hard, but enough to stay sheltered for a bit.  I took a photo there.  Biscuit is sitting in the back right. She’s very hard to see, but she’s there.  
Also at the shelter was Dal380. He’s a Vietnam Veteran hiking in honor of the 380 men who did not return home from his unit.  In further conversation I learned he’s also a retired pediatrician.  There we were a doctor and a nurse talking shop.  He’s very nice, I’m glad the trail crossed our paths.  
Seylor and I were soon on our way.  I saw there was a hand written note on the marker to the shelter we had just left. It was letting us know a bear had taken a backpack “for a ride” last night.  He said he got it back though, and all is well.  I hope the folks who camp there tonight see the note.  
There was lots of ridge hiking again today. At one point the entire side of the mountain going up was covered in flowers.  Lots and lots of white flowers with a few purple ones scattered in.  It was like hiking 100 yards of aromatherapy.  So pleasant.  
I did enjoy the fragrances, but off in the distance I could hear thunder. I also saw dark clouds coming. I had 4 miles left to hike to civilization.   Seylor is a good dog.  She’s a great hiker, but bravery is not her strong suit.   The closer the thunder came, the bigger the whites of her eyes got.  She was petrified.  
I hiked at high speed sloth pace, but I knew I was not going to beat that storm to the gap.  So I grabbed rain gear out of my backpack and prepared myself for the inevitable.  Seylor was not as ready.  As soon the rain hit and the thunder cracked overhead she took off like a bolt of lightning down that path.  When she remembered me, she turned back to get me.  She kept looking at me with fear in her eyes.  If she could talk I’m pretty sure she was saying “Whats wrong with you mom?!? Get off the trail!!!”   
Thankfully it was a quick storm that passed in about 5 minutes.  Seylor started trying to rid the world of varmints again and we hiked on.  The air was cool now which was nice, but the path was muddy which wasn’t nice.  I was so careful on those steep downs.  SO careful!!  Even still, down went McGinney.  Muddy shorts again!  I’ve stopped counting my falls. 
Next thing you know, there was Papa Big Swig walking towards us with our other 4 legged girl Gypsy Rose.  They hiked in about a half mile to meet us. We all walked out together.  
Papa Big Swig was pleased to announce that his trip to Ashville was a success.  He dropped Medicine Man off at the airport without a hitch, then he drove straight to REI.  He was checking to see if they could do anything about my ripped sleeping bag.  We weren’t getting too far with Big Agnes.  I can’t believe it, but REI exchanged it for a new one completely free of charge!  I have nothing but respect for that business!   
Aching body or not, my trail runners will be back on tomorrow.  
Until Next Time

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589937,"My alarm went off early this morning and it was raining cats and dogs.   I asked Papa Big Swig to shut it off. I quickly decided that I would sleep until the rain passed.  He sure let me sleep!  At 9:45am I came to life.   He was sitting at the table drinking coffee, watching me sleep. My body just needed the break. 
Today became an unscheduled zero.  
Papa Big Swig packed up our camper and we left a day early for our new campground.  We’ll get there tomorrow though because he rented a hotel room for tonight.  
He surprised me with a room that has a big jacuzzi tub!  He can tell I’m aching all over.  This was an early Mother’s Day gift, along with a hair cut, a pedicure, and a massage scheduled for tomorrow morning.  He’s a wonderful husband!  I don’t deserve these things, but I’m so grateful for the gifts!  
I had already planned a zero for tomorrow, but now I’m taking a double zero.  Mixed feelings about that.   I know my body needs this break, but my mind is on the trail. Papa Big Swig is only with me for 10 more days, so I’ll just enjoy our time.  
I think today offers a good opportunity to clear a few things up.  I have readers who do some research and share their findings. I love it!   So here’s a little update:

 The story of the hiker with the coconut oil on his feet is not exactly true.  He was bitten, but there was no coconut oil involved.  That part is a myth.  
The futuristic looking building is actually a Federal Aviation Administration navigation beacon.  Designated SNOWBIRD VORTAC
I plan to take full advantage of that Jacuzzi I’m looking at, so I’ll call it quits here.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590145,"I woke up in our hotel this morning.  Papa Big Swig drove me to my massage appointment.  At home I have the greatest massage therapist, so I was skeptical. However, i’m happy to report, this girl was amazing too! 
Papa Big Swig hitched up the camper while I was getting my princess treatment, and we left for Abingdon Virginia as soon as I was done.   We’re at Riverside Campground.  It offers a lot of amenities, but it’s packed!  Wall to wall campers and kids. My grands would love it here! 
We spent the rest of the day setting up our campsite, doing laundry, and going through my hiking gear.  These are the usual things I do on a zero day.  Somehow I made a wrong move getting out of our SUV and tweaked my back.  Can you believe that?  After hubby did everything to make me feel better. I’ve done this before and it takes 6 weeks to get back to normal.  Caution and Advil will be my near future.  
Another 10 days or less and I will be completely done with the Tennessee/North Carolina portion. Once I’m officially in Virginia I can send home my winter gear.   A lighter pack sounds great!   I only have 131 miles until I reach Damascus. I can do this!
I’m still having anxiety about getting to Katahdin on time.  As soon as Trail Days is over and Papa Big Swig goes home, I’ve got to focus on the trail ONLY. I  still have a couple of scheduled events I need to come off for in late June. So miles matter!  
Here’s a little statistic for you.  Most folks who drop for whatever reason, do it by Hot Springs.  I’m good and past Hot Springs!   That means  I’m officially in the top 50% now.  There continues to be hope for me!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590366,"I woke up in our camper this morning. We were out the door early.  Seylor was ready to go too.  She is such a great hiking partner!  So much so that I bought a bigger tent and tomorrow night she’ll try her first overnight with me.   I’m super excited for that!  
Less than one mile in this morning another thru-hiker came up from behind and mentioned that his dog might be on the trail later too.  Not 100 yards further up his wife and dog were coming in from a side trail.  He seemed uncomfortable having my dog around his, so Seylor and I scooted on up the trail.   
We came upon Everywhere. She’s also a thru-hiker.  Everywhere and Seylor became quick friends so we hiked together the next 4 miles. She’s a massage therapist but has been a bit of a nomad lately picking up odd jobs, funding her way through this hike.  
The trail was great today!  It was wide and soft with fallen pine needles.  It felt like I was walking on cushy carpet.  Happy knees!  Happy hips!   Happy back!  
Before I knew it I was 5 miles in!  
There was a shelter at the 5 mile point. I had planned in advance to stop there. I went ahead and fed Seylor. It was a little early for her to eat but I knew this would be the only shelter on our hike today. Just as she finished eating the other doggie showed up.  Her family stayed far away sitting on a log.  I felt bad they didn’t even come use the shelter or picnic table.  I watered Seylor quickly and we moved on.  We did not see the other doggie again. 
The rest of my day was more of the same.  Great terrain with a nice pine scent.  There was one big up.  It gave me a great view of the Nolichuckey river.  
Then the descent into Erwin TN began. I could very clearly see Erwin for what felt like an hour.  Down and around, there’s Erwin, down and around, there’s Erwin, down and around, there’s Erwin, and so on. There were a few rocky areas, but not bad at all.  
I came out of the woods at Uncle Johnny’s Hostel.  It’s a well known hostel on the trail. I didn’t stop in, but it looks nice enough from the outside.   I hiked on down the road a bit and went back into the woods for another mile or so.  Papa Big Swig met me at a parking area there.  
I had a great Mother’s Day!  I heard from all the kids.  My youngest son just called again to let me know his grades are in for this semester...all B’s and above!  Good work Kyle! His college years are cruising by too fast.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590492,"I was up early and ready to go.  I had my big backpack loaded up.  Seylor’s pack was ready to go too. Soon we were off for Seylor’s first overnight with me on the A.T. 
I had some confusion at the start today.  I had taken a little blue blaze to get to my pick-up point yesterday.   For the life of me I couldn’t seem to get back on the trail.  I kept going in a loop.  Thank goodness I have Guthook on my phone!  I had to use the GPS, but I found it! 
Early on I met up with a couple of hikers.  They are retired. One lives in Colorado and the other lives in New York.  They are Nick(real name) and Not Yet(trail name).  Nick knows nearly every plant on the trail!  I learned a lot!  I also saw my first rhododendron bloom!  It’s my featured photo.  
My plan was to hike 11 miles today, but it turns out that tentsite has no water source.  Today was really hot. Keeping myself and Seylor hydrated was a job!  So we stopped at a closer tentsite with a piped spring water source.  This was a good decision. I filled my liter bag 3 times before our thirst was quenched.  We only drank about 2.5 liters so there’s some left to sip on tonight. 
Today was mostly up. I don’t know the high temperature, but I would guess upper 80’s to low 90’s.  I sweat so much that my eyes were burning most of the day. Next visit to town I will be getting a sweat rag of some kind.  Wearing a backpack makes it impossible to use my shirt.  
All I did today was climb, but my tallest climb was Beauty Spot.  She’s another bald at 4436ft elevation.  I didn’t stay there as long I would have liked because of the heat, but the views were great!  
I got my new tent set up without a problem. I upgraded from a Big Agnes Flycreek 1 to a Big Agnes Copper Spur II.  There’s plenty of room for Seylor now.  Plus as the weather is getting warmer I feel a little claustrophobic in my little tent.  It’s a great tent though, just small.  I recommend Big Agnes anything.  They make quality equipment.  
This tentsite is very close to a mountain road.  Every time a vehicle goes by( which is not often) Seylor whines a little bit.  This could be a long night.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590590,"Seylor and I slept well last night.  She was a good girl!  I really like this group of hikers I’ve fallen in with.  They’re all around my age with the exception of one young man. His trail name is Freight Train. 
Conversations are great and relevant to me.  Even Freight Train joins in with the more mature folk conversations sometimes! Freight Train is the only black person I have met on the trail to date.  He’s from the D.C. area,and I am very impressed by his character.  I hope more of the young black community follow his lead.  Speaking of young black community, I’m trying hard to get my sister of the heart out here for a little nature hike...ahem...Obi Oki! It’s so peaceful and there’s an indescribable spirituality about it.  
Back to hiking: This day started up with Unaka Mountain at 5183ft elevation.  Whew!!! I was a sweaty mess. It was nice to get it done early before it got too hot though. 
The bugs are out by the droves right now. Little tiny sweat bees, stinging black gnats, and other unidentifiable winged nuisances!  I swallowed 3 of them before I remembered Papa Big Swig had bought me an insect hood to wear.  That thing was a life saver!   
Approaching the top of Unaka Mountain the forest became a pine forest. I love the pine forests!  Their soft carpet of fallen pine needles is a gift to my body! 
Not long after I entered the pine forest I came upon a special tree decorated with Christmas ornaments as a memorial to a young man named  Max. The tree brought a smile to my face and warmth to my heart, as I’m sure his family would want. Max’s tree is my featured photo today. 
I summited Unaka shortly after that.   It was mostly down from there.  My new group was ahead of me but I caught up with them  at a shelter for lunch. We had more great conversation, and it’s fun watching everyone try to win Seylor’s affections.  She’s extremely cautious with strangers.  
From lunch I only had 3 miles to hike until my pick-up destination.   I didn’t realize that’s all I had left while I was eating. I would not have eaten the king sized Zero bar after my peanut butter crackers. I like a sugar boost to get me over the next big section. Happy taste buds, but wasted calories.  
About 10 min before Papa Big Swig arrived, dark clouds rolled in and thunder started booming overhead. Soon enough the heavens opened up and let loose the rain.  Seylor was less than pleased. I on the other hand welcomed a refreshing rain without my rain gear. Hopefully it cooled things off enough that my fellow hikers can sleep comfortably tonight. It was too warm in our tents the night before.  I’m lucky enough to sleep in our camper tonight.  
I had a tossed salad, BBQ beef brisket sandwich and potato salad for supper.   Fresh cantaloupe for dessert. That zero bar did not ruin dinner!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590701,"My alarm went off at 5:30am and true to the weatherman’s prediction it was raining!  I got myself up anyway.  I had chocolate milk and pop tarts for breakfast. We were out the door by 6:30am.  
Papa Big Swig dropped me off around 7.30am.  This was my starting point where I had finished yesterday. I put on my little pack, then my rain poncho and headed into the woods for a full day of UP!  
I hiked alone the first 2.5 hours to Clyde Smith shelter.  I did cross paths with two SOBO’s, several lizards that were brilliantly orange colored, and one snail!  I also passed a couple of tent sites but not a human was stirring. I don’t blame them for sleeping in. Packing up a wet tent is no fun.  
The rain really didn’t bother me though. It wasn’t too cold, no insects were flying around, and I hiked at a pretty good pace for me.(speedy sloth) I was hoping that I had left early enough to catch my group from yesterday still at the shelter, but when I arrived not a soul was around.  
It was still raining cats and dogs. I sat alone, ate some peanut butter crackers and figured it was about 4 more hours hike to the next shelter.  I also checked the guest book and saw  Lorax did make it there last night, and Honeybear had been there yesterday too.  I couldn’t be too far behind my group. After 20 minutes or so I put my rain gear on and sloshed back out onto the trail. 
Not a long ways down the trail I came to a road crossing and there it was, trail magic!  Toe pick and Tank(previous A.T.hikers) had set up their suv with a pop-up canopy and cooked us a full breakfast!  Eggs with sausage and hash browns.  They had O.J. and pop too! I was the last hiker to get to enjoy it.  It was noon and that’s the time they had planned to call it quits.  It was a great breakfast lunch for me and held me the rest of the way through today’s hike. Pictured is Tank on the left, Toe Pick on the right, Short Mile eating, and Lorax getting ready to hit the trail. Yes!  I at least caught up with The Lorax! (He’s on Trail Journals too) 
Lorax and I hiked together for a little while. We had some great conversation.  He’s a very nice person, and pretty funny too! His wife is a nurse like me, and his work was similar to Papa Big Swig’s work. I’m pretty sure he’s retired now though.  Anyway we made a plan to meet at the next shelter and I eventually hiked on alone.  
At some point Short Mile caught me.   We hiked together about one “short mile” before he moved on.  So I was alone the rest of the way to the shelter.  Still raining, and still all up.  
The water was now running down the trail creating a stream.  My boots were soaked all the way through.  At one point I passed a stone fireplace with a chimney just sitting out there in the middle of nowhere. The rain and fog prevented any views today, so my  photos are of these little oddities. 
I kept on walking down the stream trail feeling thankful the bottom was mostly rock and not mud. At least my boots were just wet, not wet and muddy. 
My trekking poles were clanking on the rocks below making me a loud hiker.  This was a good thing!  I happened upon a bear grazing to my left. The noise from my poles scared the bejeepers right out of him!  He ran in front of me across the trail and up the mountain on my right. He was a fairly good sized adult, but I’m proud to say that I was totally okay with the bear.  I just enjoyed the moment watching him run.  
I only paused a minute before walking my last 200yards or so to the Roan High Knob Shelter.  It was UP all day to here, the highest shelter on the entire Appalachian Trail at 6249ft elevation! Short Mile was already there, and not long after me Cheddar and Slacker arrived(who I had not seen all day). Eventually The Lorax made it there safely too. I say safely, because today had some questionable terrain.  
The Lorax had decided to catch a ride with us into town.  He and I soon headed out for the last 1.5 miles of our day. This will be our only down today. And just like that, the rain stopped, the sun came out, and we felt warm sunshine all the way to Papa Big Swig.  
Another great day on the A.T.!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590844,"I got a late start today.  We drove about 10 miles out of town and stopped for gas.  That’s when I realized I had forgotten my hat at the camper.  Knowing it was expected to rain, we turned around and went back to grab my hat.  I did not get on the trail until after 9am. 
My hike started in Roan Mountain State Park.   When I stepped out of the vehicle elevation was already pretty high at 5569 ft. We actually drove through the clouds to get to my starting point. I continued going UP from there. High elevation means pine forest, and Soon I found myself in one. It felt enchanted. These pines were significantly deeper green in color, and the scent was far more bold than any of the previous pine forests on the trail. I just loved it!  
I spent a good portion of my first couple miles saving Dew Worms. They crawled out on the trail in yesterday’s rain and didn’t get back to grass before this morning’s sun.  My old boss and friend Marge Marc used to save worms. She loved all of God’s creatures, and taught me to do the same.  I even stopped killing spiders years ago. She passed away in 2006 after a long battle with breast cancer.  I think of her often.  
Soon I came across a blue blaze leading to a barn. This barn was renovated in 1983 and is now a great place for hikers to use as a shelter.  In its day the barn was used by “Overmountain Men” during the revolutionary war on their way to battle at Kings Mountain.  I chose to take the blue blaze and went 0.2 miles off trail to see a little piece of history.  The views alone were worth the extra mileage.  
Today was my most favorite day for views!  Once I came out of the pine forest I began my climb through a series of Balds. There was Round Bald at 5826ft then Jane Bald, then Little Hump and Big Hump.  The barn was in the middle of all that. I took my sweet little time with a good long break on some boulders up there. Had a little talk with God and thanked him for this amazing day.  I feel truly blessed. Undeserving, humbled and blessed.  
I was enjoying my time on the boulders but rain clouds were looming in the not too far distance. I stayed on there until sprinkles forced me to stop taking photos and start taking steps.  
I found myself summiting Big Hump while walking through a rain cloud. The wind and rain were a little strong at times, but I was ok.  I enjoyed the drop in temp. It was refreshing.  I was still in awe as I walked, and I kept looking all around me as much as possible.  Every direction was a breathtaking view even in the rain. Very quickly the trail had turned into mud. I just wasn’t paying close enough attention I guess. Yep, down goes McGinney!  
No harm done. I continued my hike with muddy pants.  Just as I was beginning to descend I crossed paths with a young man. He suddenly appeared in the fog. We had a good pleasant conversation. I later learned he was a ridge runner working his first day on the job. 
I came down off of Big Hump into a forest. There were lots of rocks and tree roots. The trail was a flowing creek by now.  My boots were and still are soaked. I was being very careful on the down in all of this wetness, but one slippery step on a tree root and you guessed it...down went McGinney AGAIN!  I’ve never fallen twice in one day. I landed on my left hip. It was kind of hard, but I was ok.  
Shortly after that while washing my hands in the flowing water Lorax appeared behind me.  I had no idea he or anybody was around.  I had been alone pretty much all day.  It was nice to see a familiar face.  The rain eased up about that time and we hiked together.  At one point I had gotten a little off course so I pulled out my phone to look at the Guthook’s app. I took 2 steps while looking at my phone, and you won’t believe it... down went McGinney again!  Three times! This one kind of hurt.  I managed to see a tree with a white blaze in the midst of my fall. So I got up, shook it off, and continued down our proper path.  
Lorax has family visiting and soon we met up with his brother-in-law “The Mayor”. He took our photo as we approached him. I can’t imagine what a 3 times in one day professional faller looks like in that photo! 
We chatted briefly then the three of us hiked 2.71 miles to highway 19 E.  The sun was coming out now, and the skies were clear again. We walked out of the woods at almost 5pm exactly. Papa Big Swig was patiently waiting for me. 
Papa Big Swig and I stopped for Mexican food on the way home.  I went right into that restaurant looking a disgusting mess. I have no shame anymore.  That’s what a couple of months in the mountains will do to you. Some things are important, and some things just aren’t.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590939,"Today’s start was strategically timed for Papa Big Swig to pick up Freight Train at my starting point.  He was a Trail Angel today shuttling hikers from this area to Damascus for Trail Days.  He had a second pick-up planned with two other hikers a little further up the road. According to Papa Big Swig everything worked out perfectly regarding his shuttle plans. He’s been a great Trail Angel for lots of hikers this season.  
My hike began in the rain about 9:15am. Seylor came with me, so I planned a short 10 mile day.  With rain gear on and already damp boots, I started out sloshing UP.  
The UP lasted about two miles. I passed one NOBO during that time but didn’t chat as it was raining, and Seylor isn’t always great with strangers.  Just as I reached the summit the rain stopped. I took off my rain poncho right then and never had to put it back on.  
Seylor and I hiked alone the next several miles. We came upon a cemetery beautifully tucked up in the mountains. I thought to myself “ what a peaceful place to be laid to rest”.  
About 5.5 miles in there was a blue blaze to Jones Falls.  The sound of rushing water had been calling my name for the previous half mile at least , so of course I had to take the blaze.   It was a beautiful waterfall!  Blue blazes are worth it!  
Seylor drank up some of the water as it came rushing by.  I got out my sit-upon and sat in the cool mist from the falls  long enough to eat a packet of salmon. I was feeling newly energized as I packed up my things to get back on the trail. 
It was about that time when another hiker arrived.  Seylor was not pleasant as usual with a first meeting. Thankfully he was understanding of her.  She and I left, but before we even made it back to the trail he had already caught up to us.  Tahoe Jimmy, Seylor and I hiked the next 6 miles together.   
He’s a 30 year old nomad of sorts based out of Lake Tahoe. However, he lives his life a bit on the wind.  I enjoyed his stories of working for room and board at Standing Bear Hostel.  I knew they were good people there, but Tahoe gave me further confirmation.  We talked a lot about God and faith.   He’s a man of strong faith. 
It seemed the miles just flew by as we talked.  Soon we were about 8 miles in at the only shelter on today’s hike.  We arrived just as Lorax was leaving.   He hiked the same section on a flip flop today.   This worked best for The Mayor who is slack packing him.  
It was a short 15 minutes break and we were back on the trail.  I only had about 1.5 miles to go. Our philosophical discussions continued. At one point we were so in-depth with our conversation that Tahoe accidentally stepped right onto a black snake. It jumped up and I screamed!  Seylor walked over the top of it too!  The poor thing quickly took cover in between some rocks. 
I think our conversation lent itself to a good pace because I arrived at my 10 miles pick up location a whole hour early!   I had a message waiting for me there.   It was a Zero bar wrapper perfectly positioned on a tree. I’m sure this was the handy work of Lorax.  I hope the trail crosses our paths again before this adventure is over.  Remember to look for Lorax 2018 right here on Trail Journals.  He’s a great writer.   
Since I arrived early and the conversation was good. I texted Papa Big Swig to pick me up three more miles later. Tahoe stuck with me for 2 of them before taking a side trail to a hostel.  Our conversation had to end. We did a quick fist bump goodbye and I hiked on the last mile with Seylor.  
As usual my knight in shining armor was patiently waiting there for me. I’m past the 400 mile marker now.  It was another great day on the A.T.!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591072,"Trail Days is a hikers event in Damascus, Virginia. There are activities all week, but the big fun is during the weekend. Today was my day for some fun! 
I have been looking forward to seeing hikers that I haven’t seen in weeks. I was not disappointed.  Orlando was first. Her husband Dennis was there with their two Greyhounds Syria & Bobo.  She looks great!  There’s a little story about Orlando that I’ve never told, but with her permission I’m going to tell it now. 
Orlando is a 50 something year old journalist who basically quit her job to hike the A.T.  It’s not quite that simple but that’s what she did.  She’s been a long distance runner for years, and recently has taken up swimming. She’s a picture of perfect health right? No, she’s a poster child for type 1 diabetes. She’s been on an insulin pump since her late 20’s. Insulin pumps were a new thing at that time. She told me she decided right then that diabetes was not going to rule her life. She gave it a big fat single finger salute and never looked back!  She faces her challenges and figures it out.  Orlando is a real ROCK star!  
After a great visit with Orlando & Dennis, we headed over for the parade. I didn’t know I was suppose to be in the parade.   It was the coolest thing!  
Thru-hikers walked in the parade with their class.   Classes went all the way back to the 1970’s. Seylor and I took our place with the 2018 hopefuls. I was fortunate enough to shower this morning, but mostly we were a big group of really smelly hikers!  This is why the towns folk spray us with water as we march down Main Street.  I guess that’s a long time tradition.   Papa Big Swig saw several hiker friends from the sidelines.  He took great photos for me.  
I saw Metric, Half Slow, Wilderness, and Medicine Man. I finally met Ghost. Who I’ve heard so much about.  Freight Train stopped by to say hello, and we gave Kaitlin and Taylor(now Firepink) a ride back to the trail as we left.   
I bought myself some better rain gear, ate some good food, and I even won an auction bid.  I also watched a little hiker talent show. We’ve got some truly talented hikers! A really good day huh?...it gets better!  
We got back to our campsite and within minutes there was Big Kahuna and Hugs!   Yay!  Hugs is recovered for the most part, and Big Kahuna looks great!  He brought me a T-shirt with Max Patch info on it and some Sam Adams straight from Boston!  I’m so happy to have our little Tramily  together again!  
The four of us had ribs and potato salad for supper, with some Werther’s caramel corn for dessert. Dinner was followed by a serious partial game of Hearts. Only partial because the rain rolled in fast and hard! We had to pack up and get to our campsites ASAP.  
Big Kahuna drove us to our camper.  Half of the tent-room was down from the rain.  Not sure how that happened, but both Papa Big Swig and Big Kahuna are now drenched!  Love those guys! 
I’m planning to hike tomorrow. I hope the rain lets up, but if not I’ve got some fancy new rain gear!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591222,"Papa Big Swig was due to leave today, but graciously agreed to slack pack me through Tuesday because of all this rain.  So I moseyed around this morning and got a late start. No big deal, I had a short day planned anyway. 
So we pulled up to FS 293 around 10:45am  just as two hikers popped out of the woods.  They were nice guys, I believe a father/son duo originally from Illinois.  We had some brief conversation and it was time to get going.  
They stepped aside for Seylor and I to take the lead. Seylor would not walk past them. She has such a fear of men and especially men with hats. They both had hats. We’re certain she was abused before we rescued her so she gets extra space with new people. Anyway, I told them to just come on and she will follow. She did. At one point the young guy turned around to let her pass him and get to me, but she freaked out!  She ran all the way back to FS 293!  We were more than a quarter mile in when this happened. So they went on, and I went back. There she was scared to death and so happy to see me.  Something about them just didn’t sit well with her.  
So at 1100am Seylor and I re-started our hike. There was a little bit of up this morning and a little bit of down. Nothing too rough. It was a pleasant first 5 miles.  
We did come to a small waterfall around mile #4. Seylor and I both love to sit by waterfalls, but there were three other people and a cute little terrier already catching the cool mist.  The other pooches mom said she’s afraid of big dogs, so Seylor and I moved along.   
Another mile in was my planned lunch stop,  Moreland Gap Shelter.  To my happy surprise there sat Just Kelly!  Granite was there too. He’s leap frogged with me a lot the last few days.  There was also some ladies who are part of an Appalachian Trail club.  They do weekend sections when the weather is good. These are retired ladies well into their 70’s.  It was so much fun listening to their stories. 
Just as we finished eating our lunch the terrier family arrived.  Again I was informed of the fear of big dogs so we moved on. It was time anyway.  
I had about 6 miles left for the day when it started to sprinkle.  I was so excited to pull out my new rain gear!  Exactly 45 seconds later...the rain stopped. I’m SURE there will be more opportunities to try out my new rain gear.  
Right after the rain episode. I heard large animal movement from the right.  There was an UP on my right that summited, then a big down on the other side of it. I could not see beyond the UP, but the noise was obviously a large animal.  Thinking it could be a bear I clicked my trekking poles together to scare it away.  No sooner than I did that Seylor ran up the Up, growled, and proceeded to go right on down the other side!  
NO!!! I yelled and called and ran up the UP as fast as I could.  There was no path. I just ran up the rest of the side of this untouched mountain through trees and weeds and I’m pretty sure snakes. I reached the summit and could see nothing.  No Seylor, no animal, nothing but trees and foliage all the way down, way way down the backside of this mountain.   
Forever I stood there and called her name.  I listened for the jingle of her tags. I looked for the color of her neon green backpack... nothing.  I could not go down this mountain side.  I’m sure no human has ever been down it before. So I called her name, I prayed, and I called some more.  I was about to go into hysterics when way down there out of a clump of trees she popped her head out.  Thank you God!   
It took her quite a while to work her way back up to me.  When she finally made it, she  was panting hard with her tongue hanging out. She just plopped herself down on the trail looking a bit disappointed. I gave her some water, and we went on our way.  I still have no idea what she chased.  
I had 3 or 4 miles left to go and Seylor had zero pep left in her step. When we arrived at our end point Papa Big Swig showed up with Trail Magic (soda & poptarts) so we hung out at the gap for bit to catch the thru-hikers. There was a swarm of yellow butterflies all around us while giving out Magic. Seylor climbed into the backseat and slept.  When we got to the campground she crawled into the camper, and slept... right now, Seylor is sleeping!   
I’m about to sleep too.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591411,"Our little tramily is back together!  I’m happy to announce that Hugs and Big Kahuna slack packed with me today.  So we parked Big Kahuna’s rental car at our destination then Papa Big Swig drove us to our start.   
I had accidentally left my trekking poles there yesterday evening.   Some young kids who I  think were thru-hikers had them. One kid said he was going to look for the owner. It was kind of funny because they were all folded up in his pack and someone had covered my silver duck tape with their black duck tape.  Hmmmm a little fishy!   But the one kid did give them back, and we gave them all a soda.  I hope they learned some kind of a lesson in that little exchange.  
It was a bit of a cluster at the start with lots of people milling around. The Terrier family was there.  It turns out they are part of that A.T. Section Hiker Club too. We did much better today since she knew I was not going to allow my dog near her. One of my favorite ladies from the group needed a ride to 19 so Papa Big Swig  was her Trail Angel today.  He said he enjoyed her company.  She not only helps with the trail, but she’s also a missionary in Peru 6 months out of the year. 
In order to stay ahead of the Terrier family myself, Seylor, Hugs, and Big Kahuna left out first to start chalking up the miles.  The initial hike was nice and easy until we hit rocks going down to a blue blaze waterfall known as Laurel Fork Falls. It was a short blue blaze, and the falls were absolutely beautiful to behold.  
On the way down we had passed Batman & Robin, the father/son duo from yesterday.  They were so kind.  Both of them stood completely still and looked away so Seylor would feel safe enough to pass.   She did pass without a problem.  Eventually Batman & Robin made it to the waterfall with us. Batman took off his hat and slowly but surely was able to pet Seylor!  I was so happy! That’s a big step for Seylor! They are great guys!  
So the climb up and out of the falls began.    Initially it was rocky and took us beside the river over rocks and boulders. We crossed that same river a few times. The sound of rushing water was nearby almost all day today. I love that! In total we climbed up about 1700ft over 3 miles.  It was a nice slow climb once we got past the boulders. 
About half way up we stopped at a log for lunch.  Griffin passed by as we were eating. He and I first met at Top of Georgia Hostel, then again at Davenport Gap when I came out of the Smokies.  His wife has been helping him like Papa Big Swig helps me. It was a short chat as thunder was getting closer and rain drops started falling.  I pulled out my fancy new rain gear, and we hiked on.  
Seylor and I took the lead. The other two stopped for water so I got pretty far ahead   The rains grew stronger, and the trail turned to mud. Seylor and I summited our lunch mountain first and started down.  
That’s always the problem with rain...DOWN! I’ll spare you the details and just say it was a very slow fall.  I struggled to stay on my feet a long while before My body twisted around like a corkscrew on my trekking pole and landed me hands and knees in the mud.   I was wearing shorts today. It wasn’t pretty at all.  
Not long after that Hugs and Big Kahuna could both be seen coming down the trail.  We stopped at the bottom of the mountain  for me to clean up a bit.  My new muddy rain gear was put back in my pack and onward we marched.  Big Kahuna took the lead.  
This is where life gets interesting!  So much rain has caused some significant flood issues. This includes the area where we hiked today around Watauga Lake and near Wilbur Dam.  The lake was obviously above flood level as there were several picnic tables and grills with only the tops being visible above water. 
We could see the flooded area to a footbridge. It was a little over ankle high maybe 12ft long.  Our shoes were already wet from the rain so Big Kahuna took the first steps and we followed.  I felt the cool water go over the top of my boots and rush in to surround my feet.  Squishy boots aren’t the end of the world, and cool feet felt a little nice. Us humans were laughing a bit and Seylor Jo was a tail wagging happy girl!   
Big Kahuna continued to lead while Hugs and I pulled up the rear.  We came to another area quite a bit bigger and about knee deep. Big Kahuna saw some baby ducks there. They swam away before the rest of us arrived, which is probably a good thing. I would not want Seylor to terrorize baby ducks.  
Those ducks were the least of our worries though. The water was deep enough now that we could not see where to step.  There was wooded debris floating all around. Big Kahuna took one for the team again.  He found every rock, boulder, and hole so we could safely follow.  I am extremely thankful he was with us today!  Seylor did this one too, but she wasn’t as sure about it...and she’s our water dog.  
So this pattern continued...bigger, deeper, and wider until we were waste deep literally hiking with the fish in their lake. Big Kahuna forged the way!  
He found a board bridge about 4ft below water that I’m sure was truly meant for foot travel.  He said move slow and don’t fall off.  Pretty sure falling off would have meant a full on swim. I went second while Big Kahuna was still shuffling across the board so I could gauge my location.  This was done completely on blind faith because I sure couldn’t see a thing below the water and debris.  Then Hugs was up.  
She started making her way across when we all realized Seylor Jo wasn’t having anything to do with this one.  She would start in and turn back.  Hugs,  being the champ she is, went back and helped Seylor swim across.   Can you believe that?  A dog needed help swimming? Hugs was Seylor’s Trail Angel today.  
I would like to say that one was the end, but no.  We helped Seylor a few more times.  It became comical.   At one point Seylor latched onto a log and we just floated her along on the log. In her defense the water was very deep and I’m sure she couldn’t tell how far the swims would be. 
Eventually the ground started getting higher as we worked our way up and out of the swampy bog.  Seylor’s tail was wagging and we were all pretty proud of ourselves for braving the challenge and not missing a single white blaze!  
Big Kahuna is a good leader.  We fell in place behind him at a good pace while Seylor made her own blue blazes ridding the world of chipmunks.  She’s still 0 for something like 4,365. (Ok I made up that number). Either way, she always comes back empty handed, but tail wagging.  
We had maybe 2 miles to get to our destination. The rain had stopped.  No rain is a good thing,but coming down out of that mountain was still tricky.  A steep down that’s muddy takes skill, and wet tree roots at an angle can be nearly impossible at times.  That’s what happened to Hugs. One step onto a wet sloped tree root, and down went McGinney.  No hope for a save.  It looked painful, but she got up brushed herself off and carried on.  True to the thru!  
We were getting close to the end of our hike when we came upon a clearing. It was a gap of sorts.  None of us had seen a soul for hours.  I let them move ahead so I could take a quick potty break.  All of that water had my bladder about to bust! I really didn’t go hide anywhere as there was nobody else for miles.  Then from nowhere appeared a young man.  Yep, caught with my pants down!  That was our last giggle of the day.

I will be on my own for about 6 weeks.  I say on my own, but my little tramily is starting out with me. We’ll look out for each other as we make every day an adventure. 
Planning 6 weeks in one backpack takes some thought. I’m working on that now. Do I wear my new boots and also carry Trail Runners? Do I just wear boots and have Papa Big Swig ship trail runners when or if I need them?  Decisions decisions. I’m worried about new boots and new blisters!  
Side note: I can’t believe I’ve already worn out my first pair of boots!  
There was a bunch of craziness today doing laundry, resupplying, and getting my backpack right.  But Big Kahuna took care of dinner for us.  That was a nice relief and scrumptious too!  We cleaned up while our bellies were full, then played a couple games of Scrabble.  
I guess I’m as ready as I’m going to get.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591642,"It was noon before we got on the trail today.  Everybody had loose ends to tie up before starting out on this extended trek.  
Papa Big Swig saw a beautiful turtle in the middle of the road while driving. We had to stop for him too.  After a few photos I moved the little guy to safety. I may not be on duty right now, but I’m still saving lives!  
The late start wasn’t too worrisome.  We had planned only a 10 mile hike today.
Today’s terrain started out UP.  Not a horrible UP. It was a slow steady incline over several miles.  Other than heat and sweat the climb was comfortable.  
In many areas foliage has grown into the path making the trail significantly more narrow. Oftentimes I felt grass and shrubs rubbing against my legs or shoulders on both sides.  This,  in combination with excessive sweating, left me with itchy skin today.  
Itchy or not, I really do enjoy seeing all of the green!  Today was exceptionally beautiful as many times there were  sections with bright pink rhododendron blooms or pretty peach colored flowers.  I thought those flowers might be Honeysuckle, but one taste, and I knew it wasn’t!  Big Kahuna told me later that they are Azaleas.   
About 2 hours into the hike we all stopped at a water source for a break.  It was there where we met Snorax and Deadfall.  They are a father-in-law/Son-in-law duo out for some section hiking. They played tag with us the rest of the day  
Because this is Hugs’ first day with a full pack after her fractured foot. I took the lead.  She needs to go slow for a while.  
During our second break we realized our math was wrong. Today’s hike was actually more than 10 miles. Still no big deal. Sunset is after 8pm now. 
I met a hiker pooch named Whiskey Girl. She greeted me with tail wags and came right up for a rub behind her ears. It made me think of Seylor Jo. She went home today with Papa Big Swig and our little cock-a-poo Gypsy Rose. I miss all of them already.  
Since I was in the lead, I arrived at Iron Mountain Shelter first.  I was pleasantly surprised to see Lorax sitting there! Soon Freight Train showed up, then Deadfall, Big Kahuna, Hugs, and Snorax. It felt like a big old Tramily Reunion! 
I made myself instant mashed potatoes for supper.  I threw in some chicken chunks and a cheese stick Big Kahuna gave me.  It was Mmm mmm good!   Dessert was a freeze dried ice cream sandwich.  They are really tasty!   
It’s well past hikers midnight now. My Big Agnes is keeping the bugs away.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591794,"I woke up this morning in my tent at Iron Mountain Shelter around 6:30am. It took about an hour and a half to get breakfast, then break down camp and hit the trail.  Myself, Hugs, and Big Kahuna were a few hundred yards north when I realized I had left my Spot locator at camp.  I hiked back, and they hiked on.  
I decided to go ahead and drop pack when I got back there because I had also forgotten to take my vitamins.  After about 10 minutes, I put my backpack back on feeling like everything was done and I re-started my hike.   Not much more than 100 yards later, I had to potty.  Once again I dropped pack. Finally when I picked that thing up and put it back on for the 3rd time, I was truly good to go!  
That’s about the time Lorax showed up.  He and I commenced to hiking for pretty much the rest of the day.  We caught up to Big Kahuna and Hugs at a foot bridge.  
We all took a break together.  Even though myself and Lorax had just stopped for a candy bar a few minutes before.  The water was clear, and it was a cool place to sit. Big Kahuna caught a Salamander while we were there. I took a photo and  he released him back into the wild.  
The four of us hiked mostly together the rest of the day.  Our meanderings took us to and through some livestock pastures.  We were prepared for cows and horses, but didn’t see a single one. There were plenty of remnants though!  It was fun to see the A.T. symbol painted on the barn.  
Our campsite is nice and we were able to get all 4 of our tents in the same general area.  After my supper of Chicken and Noodles it was time for a highly competitive game of Euchre.  Me and Big Kahuna took home the win!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591796,"Another beautiful morning on the A.T.!  I was awakened around 6:30am by my morning birds alarm.  I continued to lay there and listen to them chirp until Big Kahuna’s voice came through...”are you up?”  He’s clearly the responsible one of the group!  Hugs and I are always last up.  
I had my morning routine over with by 8am.  Hugs, myself, and Big Kahuna hit the trail early.  Lorax had a hole to dig.  He would have to catch up.  We ended up separated, so I mostly hiked alone the first couple of hours.  We all caught each other and stopped at some ruins.  I was highly disappointed.  I still don’t exactly know what they are calling ruins.  I took no photos. 
Lorax took the lead. About 1.5 miles up the trail from the ruins we reached the Virginia state line.  We all stood side by side and on the count of 3 took one giant step.  Adios Tennessee!   
Three states down and 11 states to go.  
Virginia has the most miles in one state on the A.T.   It’s a little over 500 miles. That’s 1/4 of the whole trail!  Because Virginia is so long and sometimes mundane it is said that thru-hikers get the Virginia blues.  I don’t see myself having that problem because I’m loving every step.  
As a group we hiked into Damascus.  Yes, the same town that hosts Trail Days.  I’m here because I walked here this time.  We all rented a bed at the Woodchuck Hostel.  Tomorrow Woodchuck himself will drive us  12.5 miles north and we will hike south right back to Damascus for one more night at the Woodchuck Hostel.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591933,"I woke up  here at WoodChucks Hostel and laid in bed thinking for a few minutes. I had a moment when I was a little teary eyed.  I miss my hubby. I miss my kids and grands too. For me this is one of the hardest things about being on the trail. I love this adventure, but my family is everything.  
Soon enough  I was brought out of my funk by the scent of blueberry waffles coming up from the kitchen!  I went down to find waffles, fresh fruit, potatoes, eggs, cereal, and coffee!  What a great breakfast!  
This is my favorite hostel so far.  It feels a little like home.  For $30 I get a night’s stay on real beds with real sheets, a warm shower, and that marvelous breakfast!  For an extra $5 we can do laundry.  If I ever own a hostel I would base it off of this model.  
After breakfast,  myself, Hugs, Big Kahuna and Lorax were shuttled north to hop on the trail and hike back to our  hostel.  This was another flip flop slack pack day. Just as we were being dropped off to start hiking  the rain began to fall.  It continued to fall for the first 5 hours of my hike.  
My fancy new rain gear is being exchanged for a different size, so I’m back in the poncho.  That poncho makes me sweat so badly!  I took it off before I should have and decided to embrace the rain today. It didn’t take long for my hands to become pruney. All of my clothing was drenched including my boots. 
Myself and Lorax took the early lead.  The trail today was a good mix of a little UP, a little DOWN, some soft pine trail and some rocky areas...all of it was soaking wet.  We hiked along a river most of the day. We crossed a few foot bridges. All of them were very well maintained.  So far I’m liking Virginia.  
The most beautiful thing about today was the flowers.  So many rhododendron blooms! They are no longer bright pink but more of a lavender color.  Also Mountain Laurel is in bloom right now.  Sometimes it felt like I was walking through a hallway of flowers.  
Lorax and I stopped at a shelter for lunch.  It’s nice to lunch at a shelter when it’s raining. This particular shelter was 0.2 miles off trail so Lorax and I left a message made of sticks and leaves on the path.  Sure enough it worked. Before long there was Hugs, and Big Kahuna. The 4 of us were able to have our snacks together.  
After lunch we got separated a bit. I didn’t see Lorax at all until supper time at the hostel.  He will not be moving on with our tramily in the morning. I hope he enjoys church tomorrow, I hope his blisters heal, and I hope the trail brings us back together again.  
Here in Damascus the Appalachian Trail crosses paths with the Virginia Creeper bicycle trail.  At times they are one and the same.  I would hear someone yell “ON YOUR RIGHT” just before a bicycle would whiz by me on my right side.  It was something different and kept things interesting. That portion of the trail is also extremely well maintained.  
Supper for me was leftover chicken wings from yesterday.  My belly is full and my boots are drying.  I’ll put them back on in the morning and start out on a 4 day stretch.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592092,"Up at 6am today to those lovely breakfast smells at the hostel.  I ate quickly and readied my pack for 4 more nights and 5 days of trail.  I filled my water bottles and put it on the scale.  36.5 pounds.  That’s not too bad with all of my food and 2 liters of water.  
By 7:30am we were ready to go.  Woodchuck pulled his van around to get us loaded up.  The rain had started about an hour before, but miraculously it quit.  We all said a sad goodbye to Lorax, and we were off.  
Our journey started Up, soon we found ourselves looking at the most beautiful pine forest.  I wouldn’t want to guess how tall they were, but they were the tallest pines I’ve ever seen!  
A short distance after the pines we came to a grassy hill and pasture.  I was hearing some moo’s for a while, then all the sudden right there was a herd of momma cows and their babies.  I took lots of pictures.  The cutest things ever!  
The REAL up started right after those cute  little cows. I think it was about 3.7 miles of UP to Buzzard Rock at 5087ft elevation.  The views there were amazing.  Today’s photo is of me standing on a Buzzard Rock.  
The hike down from there was a little rocky. I hiked alone most of the way.  At 1:10pm I heard thunder.  We had enjoyed exactly 5 hours of great hiking weather, before the rains came.  Yes my shoes were soaked again today.  Pruney hands and pruney feet!  
It has rained so much more than I ever expected.  Just as I was trying to cheer myself up, I came to a clearing near a road to find TRAIL MAGIC!!!   This is a family who has lost two thru-hikers, and they are paying it forward in their memory.  This was so far the best trail magic I’ve had.  Fresh fruit, a vegetable salsa that was to die for!  Pop, chips, cupcakes, hotdogs and more.  They took trash, charged phones, and provided an awning to protect us from the rain. They have no idea how grateful all of us were.  I’m sure their loved ones were smiling down today. 
From there it was another up over a large grassy hill through another pasture with more cows.  No babies this time.  They stood right on the trail.  I made sure they were all girls before I walked by. Bulls scare me! 
Soon I was back in the woods with only 3 or 4 miles until the shelter.  That’s when another miracle happened.  The rain stopped!  Hallelujah!  I came upon a pasture off to the right of the forest/trail and the view was amazing so I walked over there.  Glad I did!  Right there was a small group of wild horses.  I didn’t know they were wild until after the fact.  Big Kahuna  and Hugs appeared on the other side so I walked right through the horses to get to them.  It was funny because they started licking our legs like a salt block.  We really enjoyed them!  Nonetheless, had I known they were wild I would have chosen a different path.  
We were only 1.1 miles from the shelter.  It was more UP.  Lots of rocks today too.  The shelter was packed with the younger crowd so we hiked on about 1/4 mile and pitched our tents.  We invited Kiwi to join us.  She’s a thru-hiker from New Zealand. The scene at the shelter wasn’t her thing either.  Big Kahuna now has 3 girls to look out for!  
There’s been a bear problem in this area so they’ve put up temporary electric fence around bear boxes for our food.  Big Kahuna took all of our food and put it up for us.  Chivalry lives on in Big Kahuna.

The rain continued off and on all day.  Sometimes I think it was just falling from the trees when the wind blew, and sometimes it just rained.  It’s exhausting hiking in the rain. Every single step must be taken cautiously and deliberately or you will fall.   Yesterday Big Kahuna took a hard fall, and another hiker fell slicing her knee open pretty bad. This morning her bandage had blood all the way through it.  I bet she needed stitches.  
So when I came to the trail for our lunch shelter I really didn’t want to go.  There were several steps up and it was way off trail. I had arrived first though so I went ahead up there.  I’m glad I did because the shelter had a little awning of sorts with a picnic table under it. Yay, a dry place to eat!! 
After lunch we really didn’t take anymore breaks.  I usually like to drop pack every two hours or so for just a few minutes, but this rain makes it difficult to do that. Probably another reason I’m exhausted.  As usual we sort of separated when hiking.  We all hike at different speeds, but we end up in the same place.  
I was in front again, and alone.  I actually enjoy hiking alone.  I spent a lot of time today thinking about my mom and how I miss her chocolate cake.  I wish I had learned how to make that cake.  
My sauntering brought me to a beautiful waterfall. Comers Creek Falls was a breath of fresh air!  Even though it had been raining I was sweaty and hot.  The rain had stopped so I took off my plastic poncho and enjoyed the cool mist.  
The sun never came out today, but there were moments with no rain. The no rain moments were lovely.  There was a beautiful mixture of rhododendrons and Mountain Laurel.  I think the Mountain Laurel only blooms for a few weeks, so I’m glad I get to see so much of it.  
After 10 miles I popped out on a main road. Once the whole tramily arrived we decided to hitchhike into Troutdale.  A produce delivery guy picked us up and drove us to Sufi Lodge.  The funniest thing...all 5 hikers here tonight are the same 5 of us who stayed in the shelter last night!  We enjoyed a delicious dinner together.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592420,"I woke up at the Sufi Lodge around 6am.  The owners overslept so breakfast was late.  No big deal, it was raining anyway.  
Breakfast was pancakes with blueberries and walnuts.  They tasted good, just like last nights dinner. I had some Earl Grey hot tea to drink.  
The rain had stopped by the time we loaded up in the shuttle. We were back on trail by 8:45am. The trail started UP in the Raccoon Branch Wilderness.  Yes yes yes!  I love the name!   And as it turns out I love the trail!  Much fewer rocks or at least smaller rocks, and lots of pine needles. 
I had more tunnels of rhododendrons and Mountain Laurel. It was beautiful. As I was hiking past some very old trees I was thinking about the pioneers and mountain men before me who may have touched the very same trees. Did Daniel Boone or Davey Crocket walk this trail, or touch these trees? I don’t know, but it’s certainly possible.    
I had managed to get pretty far ahead of the others. I mostly hike alone anyway, but today it was a good thing! My low belly started rumbling. It was cramping, and I knew... that food I liked didn’t like me!  I was on a ridge and there really isn’t anywhere to go!  I couldn’t help it.  I dropped my pack right on the trail and ran the two whole trees over that I could. Nearly messed my own pants as I was trying to get them down. I will never eat Syrian food again!  
After that excitement I got back on trail and was enjoying the nice terrain.  There was no rain my whole hike, and at 11:45am the sun came out! It was only there for a few minutes before cloud cover took over, but it was nice. There were gentle breezes all day and I just couldn’t be happier.  
Soon I came to the trail for Trimpi Shelter which was our lunch meeting place. As I approached the clearing there were 3 hikers there. Two of them had to step over my backpack on the trail as I was taking care of emergent business. Of course they asked why my pack was just there in the middle of the trail.   After a good laugh, they told me they were glad it turned out ok.  
I skipped lunch...
The afternoon trail was equally as nice.  I hiked through another pasture.  There were no cows.  I thought I was face to face with a bull the other day, but I learned girl cows can grow horns too.  I had no idea.  
During the last few miles of my hike I saw a sign from God.  It’s today’s photo. I know I’m on the right path. I just enjoyed the gentle breezes all the way to Partnership Shelter.  We are sleeping upstairs.  It’s a bit of a pain climbing the ladder, but we don’t have to hang our bear bags!   I took a cold shower before Hugs and Big Kahuna arrived.   I couldn’t believe they offer a shower!  I didn’t even care it’s cold water only.  
The rest of the tramily set up their sleeping bags and we walked up to a visitor center to order pizza.  Just our luck,  no answer at the pizza place, then an answer and a hang up.  We had been dreaming of pizza all day knowing there was delivery at our shelter. It’s never happened before that we were close enough to town to get delivery.  It wasn’t in the cards for us today either.  
We hopped on someone else’s shuttle and rode into town.   It’s all you can eat buffet at Pizza Hut today!  JACKPOT!  
Now our bellies are full and our eyelids are heavy.  Waiting for a return shuttle.

",Partnership Shelter,"May 30, Wed",13.60
Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592549,"On a whim we decided to slack pack today.  Cartman, a hiker Big Kahuna has known for a while, was staying at Partnership Shelter all day today.  He watched our big packs for us.  In exchange we brought him a roast beef sandwich and a nice garden salad with an ice cold Dr Pepper to drink. Fresh fruits and veggies are a treat on the trail. 
We all 3 started out together going up with some ridge hiking.  The breezes were nice on the ridges and the summits too. There was a steady rise and fall of ups and downs, but it mostly felt up as there was one really BIG up! 
We saw a beautiful doe while we were hiking a ridge.  I think she’s the largest doe I’ve ever seen!  Our voices scared her so she ran away before we could get a picture.  Another photograph in my mind.  
Big Kahuna knows a lot about plants and was teaching us about all kinds of vegetation and flowers as we passed them. At one point we hiked through an entire mountainside of Ferns.  He said “you would pay $25 in a flower shop for that”.  I’m sure he’s right!  Wish I could have just dug some up and shipped them home. 
In our meanderings we met up with a new(to us) hiker. His name is DJ. He’s a newly retired military man almost exactly my age.  We both turn 54 in July.  He’s taking time to hike the A.T. before he gets a new civilian job.  He and I struck up a good conversation and talked the whole way up our big climb of the day. Glade Mountain 4,093 ft elevation!  I must be getting in better shape because I’ve never been able to do an up like that and still talk.  I’m usually lucky to keep moving and breathing! Anyway, it turns out he and I have been on the trail together since the beginning.  We may have even sheltered together in the Smokies, but the trail didn’t bring us together for conversation until today.  
DJ stopped for lunch at Chatfield Shelter.  I stopped with him to refill water and wait for Hugs and Big Kahuna.  I didn’t eat because we were planning a late lunch at The Barn. It’s a known hiker restaurant that’s located at the end of our hike today. It wasn’t long before my lovely tramily arrived and we continued on.  
We came upon a one room school house now known as Settlers Museum. It was the Lindamood Schoolhouse built in 1894. One teacher taught grades 1 through 7 and school was in session from October to March. Teachers were paid a whopping $30 a month. The Lindamood Schoolhouse was in operation until 1939. 
A local Methodist Church keeps it stocked with magic for us hikers.  They even placed a sign on the trail directing us to it. Inside there were wooden trunks that looked completely appropriate for the era. But when the lids are lifted there’s a cooler inside filled with ice cold pop. Other trunks had snacks and one had supplies. 
We all had a pop and snack. I helped myself to an emery board and some toilet paper.  Hugs was happy to find allergy medicine. I was pretty impressed by how they maintained the character of the school while still treating us hikers to some modern day goodies. I’ve been thinking I should send a thank you to that church.  They do a phenomenal job!  
I was in the Schoolhouse when today’s rain began to fall. Ugh!  I pulled out my poncho and followed Hugs and Big Kahuna down the trail. This was our first big down today.  Downs are the hardest in the rain. Within a few minutes it was like a muddy slip-n-slide.  Us girls managed to stay on our feet, but Big Kahuna wasn’t so lucky. He bounced back up faster than I could blink!  We could see prints in the mud where others before him had experienced the same misfortune.  
Eventually we popped out on U.S. Route 11 and walked a short distance to The Barn. My salad was great, but lunch was just okay for me.  We ate most of ours and ordered Cartmans food before calling a shuttle.  We used Jim Sparks again. He had taken us to Pizza Hut yesterday.  
Jim and his wife Carrie are real trail angels.  They shuttle us hikers all over for donations only.  Their son was a thru-hiker and they do this to pay it forward.  They’re retired and I think they also get a kick out of talking to us hikers.  
They took us back to the shelter where we gave Cartman his dinner and picked up our packs. Then they drove us to a hotel so we could check in, then to Walmart and back to our hotel.  Really kind people!  I’m seriously loving Virginia!  
We’ve been 8 days without a zero. Tomorrow is our day to do laundry and rest our bodies.  This comfy bed feels great!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592650,"My zero day here in Marion Virginia started early.  I was up at 6am.  The three of us met for breakfast downstairs at 7am.   I had waffles and scrambled eggs.  
Our favorite shuttle folks were at the hotel by 7:30am for Hugs’ trip to the doctor. I jumped in for a ride to the laundromat. I was able to get all of our laundry done while she was at the doc.  The timing worked out perfectly.  
I have loved the folks here in Marion...except the folks who frequent the laundromat.  I’ll leave it at that.  Overall this is a lovely community filled with wonderful people.  
Back at the hotel I spent time preparing my pack.  I had set up my tent last night to dry it out.  So that came down and got packed away. I sorted through my belongings and organized my food.  Papa Big Swig had shipped a resupply box to me here. Going through that was a little like Christmas. I even got some love notes in with my meals. He’s so sweet! 
I ate a Mountain House meal right here in my hotel room for lunch.  We had BBQ for dinner and it may very well have been the best brisket I’ve ever eaten!  Deliciousness! 
My photo is of the county courthouse located in Marion.  There are hundreds of crosses with an American flag spreading over a couple of blocks.  I thought this was a beautiful display for Memorial Day. One of those crosses bares the name of Carrie Sparks father.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592787,"We all planned to have breakfast this morning at a place called Sisters.  It’s known for fancy coffee and scones.  Hugs was so excited for good coffee.  She grabbed up her stuff and beat us out the door.  By the time Big Kahuna and I started making our way down the street she was half way back with no coffee in her hand. Sisters doesn’t open until 10am.  What a bummer, and what coffee shoppe doesn’t open until 10am?  
Carrie, our favorite shuttle gal picked us up at 9am.  I cannot say how wonderful she and her husband Jim really are.   We will be forever grateful for their kindnesses.  
Carrie drove us quite a distance to the hostel we will be staying at tonight.  We dropped off our full packs.  Then she drove us back to the barn with a stop at Circle K in between.  She also gave us a little lesson on medicinal plants. There’s a plant out here called a Jewel Plant that works much like Aloe.   She pulled one for us so we would know exactly what to look for.   We also saw another deer during our time with Carrie.  
From The Barn we crossed a road and went under an overpass, then started into a pasture.  It was a little warm with no shade trees, but the pasture itself was beautiful with tall grass that danced in the breeze.  No livestock was out. 
I hiked ahead in the woods and came across the official sign marking 1/4 of the trail completed. We had to get a photo so I waited for Hugs and Big Kahuna right there. It’s hard to believe that I only have to do this 3 more times!  I’m laughing at myself right now!  Nothing about this hike is “only” or easy.  But everything about this hike is rewarding, even life changing.  
We hiked together from there. I needed a water resupply and about a mile away was a stream.  When we arrived there was a SOBO standing in the stream. She was hiking solo.  I told the others to go ahead while I get water.  I knew I could catch them.  They hiked on. It was about that time this lady creeped me out.  She insisted on filling my water bag because she didn’t want to get out of the stream.  When she looked at me it felt like she was sizing me up for dinner. It was weird!  My friends were long gone. I just wanted my water and to get out of there before she grew a wart on her nose and cast a spell on me.  She did hand me my water.  I squeezed it through that Sawyer Squeeze filter faster than you could say the alphabet!  Then I left abruptly, mid-sentence actually, and hurried to catch up with my tramily.  Hugs agreed with me, something about that SOBO was witchy.   
The rest of our hike was just pleasant. A cute little baby bunny hopped out on the trail.  He stayed a while so we took some photos.  We did go through 2 more pastures.  The first one had cows with calves. Yes there was another female cow with horns.  Later we went through a pasture with male cows... they scare me!  Big Kahuna had to go first.  
We finished hiking around 6pm and our hostel host Mack picked us up.  This hostel Appalachian Dreamer is the most beautiful hostel I’ve been in so far.  He has a website if you want to check it out.  Try googling Appalachian Dreamer.  Anyway, he made baked spaghetti for supper along with green beans, corn casserole, dinner rolls, homemade Pickles and cheesecake for dessert.  I had seconds of everything except dessert.  My belly is full and my heart is happy.  
Today’s photo is the view from our hostel.  Can you imagine sipping your morning coffee while staring at that every morning?  Breathtaking!  I’m in love with Virginia!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592918,"We were up by a little past 6 o’clock this morning. As I shuffled across the floor to the bathroom I could already smell bacon coming up from the kitchen below.  Our host Mack is just wonderful!  He cooked bacon and sausage, fresh from the coop scrambled eggs, hash browns, and toast.  We ate and drank coffee until our bellies were happy.  Then he gave us toast to make bacon and egg sandwiches. We took those with on our hike today.  Our bellies were happy again at lunch time! 
Mack is a thru-hiker himself.  He understands us.  He says he’s almost 75 years old.  I’d like to know who told him that, because he’s as young as me in every way.   
After breakfast he shuttled us north about 18 miles as the crow flies.  In mountain miles I couldn’t begin to guess.  I think it was about a 45 minutes drive.   He dropped us off to begin our southbound slack packing flip-flop.  Today will be the biggest miles any of us have hiked in one day so far.   
I took the rear this morning.  It always takes me about an hour to really get going.  We started out UP.  
Yesterday it sprinkled only, and this morning the skies were clear.  Even though there were muddy places, this is the most dry the trail has been for over a week.  I was enjoying this whole new concept of dry hiking when I haphazardly stepped on an angled rock that was still wet.  I can’t believe it happened again!  Yes, down went McGinney. 
I wasn’t hurt at all, but decided I should stick closer to my tramily.  The only problem with that idea was a snake.  It was a striped green and yellow snake.  I’m pretty sure he was non venomous, and he was a little guy. It soon became clear to me that he had no intention of moving off the trail.  I was on a ridge so I really couldn’t go up or down to get around him.  I decided to use my trekking pole and scoot him along. He wasn’t having it!  Stubborn little snake!  After about 5 minutes he slowly moved himself under a rock and I was able to get past.  
I finally reached the others just as we were about to start our big UP to Chestnut Knob Shelter at 4407ft elevation.  The view up there was breathtaking. But before we started up I spied a very large black snake on the side of the trail. Hugs had walked right past her. She was a beautiful snake!  We took a few minutes to watch her slowly make her way into the woods away from the trail. 
We were planning to eat our bacon and egg sandwiches at the shelter, but we decided to find a shade tree instead.  Some of the kids on the trail seem to think they’re the only ones here.  They smoke inside the shelters which is a big no-no.  None of us want to eat lunch while smelling and breathing smoke.  
Before long we came upon a pond with a piped spring water source.  Myself and Big Kahuna sat down to eat our sandwiches. Hugs had received a happy birthday phone call from her son so she walked on and would eat later.  It’s rare that we are able to get a phone call in the mountains, so I’m really happy it happened on her special day.  
Big Kahuna finished eating first. Before he hit the trail he pointed out a beautiful Tulip Tree in full bloom. In my mind I planned to get a picture when I was done eating, but instead I went to the spring and refilled my water supply.  About a half mile later I realized I had not taken the picture.  One more photograph in my mind.  
By now I was a good 20 minutes behind Big Kahuna and probably 40 minutes behind Hugs.  I was behind all dog gone day!  
At first I meandered slowly.  The Mountain Laurel is in full bloom everywhere.  I couldn’t get enough of the fragrance.  So many times I stopped just to admire the beauty of all the white flowers on a mountain side.  Sometimes while hiking a ridge it felt like I was in a tunnel of Mountain Laurel.  This was my very most favorite flower day!  
Suddenly I realized I was way way behind. Our shuttle was scheduled for a 6pm pick up.  I could not be late. Thankfully the terrain was nice and I could jog the ridges.  I jogged for 20 minutes!  Finally I caught up to both of them.  Hugs had stopped to eat her bacon and egg sandwich. That was my saving grace.  
I stuck with my tramily until about 5pm.  That’s when the thunder started getting close.  Only a couple more miles to go so I jogged a little again.  I arrived at our pick up site a few minutes early, but Mack was already there. 
Back at the hostel we showered while Mack prepared dinner. Tonight’s dinner was hot dogs and French fries, with Mack’s “imported sweet tea”!  (Imported from Walmart). For dessert he had baked Hugs a birthday cake. It was a delicious pound cake!  He also made homemade ice cream!  I thought I had died and gone to heaven!  We love this hostel!  We love Mack! Remember Appalacian Dreamer Hostel.  It doesn’t get any better than this.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593086,"I woke up at 2:30 this morning in horrible pain.  My hips, my back, and my knees were letting me know that I should not jog in the mountains ever again. I took 600mg of Ibuprofen and laid back down.  It took forever to kick in.  Then around 3:30 this morning I remembered that I had not yet taken out my contacts.  I got back up to take care of that... only to find I had already taken them out. Ugh!! I finally fell into a good sleep just as the alarm went off.  
There’s no whining in hiking. Hahaha!!! I whined all morning, but I got up and got moving.  Mack made pancakes for breakfast.  They were yummy!  He’s so good to us, we don’t want to ever leave.  
He drove us to Bland where we began hiking southbound back to where we had started yesterday. This will be our last slack pack flip-flop for a couple of days.  Tomorrow we will begin in Bland and head north with our full packs. 
I took Ibuprofen again just as we started hiking. It had been 6 hours since my last dose.  This aching is no joke, but it turned out to be my lucky day!  Because the terrain was wonderful.   
Hiking the first 13 miles today felt effortless.  The terrain was so soft and even.   I was mostly ridge hiking and the miles flew by in no time.  I continued to enjoy all of the beautiful Mountain Laurel. It smells so good!
Soon I came to a wooden bridge that crosses Laurel Creek. There was a soft gentle rush of water flowing under the bridge.  Mountain creeks are so clear.  I could easily see the rocks below.   I expected I would see fish too, but there were none today.  
I left my tramily at the bridge and moved on ahead.  The truth is, I was looking for a place to potty.  There would be no privy for 10 miles. This can oftentimes be a difficult task for a girl.  These are the only times I wish I were a boy. I was on a ridge, and to my left were rhododendrons.  The right side was not even an option.  One step and straight down.  So I’m trying to convince myself to just step into the rhododendron bushes real quick, but I have this thought that under those bushes would be a great place for snakes to hide. Just as I’m thinking about the snakes something long and thin kind of copper colored(orange-ish) moved right in front of me on the trail!  Thinking I’ve just encountered my first copperhead I jumped  way back.  My heart was pounding until I realized it was a rolled up leaf being moved by the wind. My imagination is working overtime!  
Big Kahuna later said that butterflies sometimes lay their eggs on leaves and roll the leaf up to protect them.  That could have been a butterfly leaf.  We see many butterflies every day.  
With about 3 miles to go the trail that I know and love showed up. There was a big climb to over 4000 feet elevation. That was followed by a very rocky down.  The rock formations were huge.  Somehow I managed to stay on my feet the whole way down.  
My favorite hostel host was waiting at the bottom.  He was passing out magic.  All 3 of us took a soda before climbing into the truck.  It was about 45 minutes back to the hostel. 
We all showered while Mack prepared dinner.  Homemade vegetable soup with fried bologna sandwiches!  The soup was just like my mom’s vegetable soup. Of course we had more cake and ice cream for dessert too. Every minute here has been so nostalgic for me. I’m sad to be leaving tomorrow.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593184,"I woke up for what will be my last morning at Appalachian Dreamer Hiker Hostel. Mack was the very best host ever again this morning.  We had bacon and sausage with cheesey scrambled eggs, toast and as always a fresh pot of coffee.  
After breakfast we got our big packs ready and loaded up for our last shuttle into Bland. We took a few photos with Mack first then hit the road. 
Mack had to avoid 5 different animals during the drive.  A deer, a chipmunk , a bunny, a bird, and a groundhog.  The bird was a bird of prey and all white.  We think maybe it was an owl.  After a stop at Dollar General and the Post Office Mack delivered us to our starting point. 
Today’s hike started on the road at a little store.  After walking about a 1/4 mile I entered the woods on the wrong side of the road.  My  tramily followed me for a bit, but it didn’t feel right.  Hugs checked her Guthook app and we all did an about face.  Hugs was now in the lead.  
My ascent into the mountains started with a climb of 3200 ft.  I know I’ve climbed higher, but this climb felt eternal.  It was a very slow up.  Once that was under my belt and I was on the ridges everything was pleasant... even with a full pack. 
I took the lead after our lunch break.  We all ate a sandwich brought from Mack’s place.  Mine was fried bologna with mayo. Mmmmm good!  I managed to get a good distance ahead.  So I was all alone when I reached the rocks on the trail marking 600 miles.  I waited for the tramily so we could enjoy that milestone together.  I can’t believe that I’ve walked 600 miles!  
I was down to about 400ml of water at that point.  Big Kahuna didn’t have much left either. There was suppose to be a water source about 0.3miles ahead but when I got there it was dry.  The next source was over 3 miles away.  
There were several climbs in that 3+ miles and I was super thirsty.  Thankfully when I arrived there was water. It was a very shallow creek and took some creativity with a leaf to be able to collect the water. Big Kahuna and I filled bags while Hugs filtered.  I left there with 2 liters of filtered water plus 3 liters of unfiltered water.  
We had a little over a mile to get to our planned tentsite.  Again it was UP.  I could feel every ounce of that 5 liters as I put one foot in front of the other. I had to bring that much water because it’s many miles before the next source tomorrow. Today there was a dry water source and yesterday I had a dry source too.  I’m really surprised by that since it recently rained every day for a week.  
Right now I’m comfy in my tent. I left the rain-fly up on one side to help catch a breeze.   It’s fun being able to look outside. Hopefully I’ll see some night animals.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593339,"Another rough night for sleeping.  I really did something to my back when I was jogging the other day.  I can feel a small lump at my surgical site, and it hurts to touch it. I took Ibuprofen again without much relief.  It seems I do fine when I’m up hiking, but the minute I lay down it starts shooting pain mostly to my leg, but sometimes I feel it clear to my ankle. My I.T. bands are super tight too.   I spent about 2 hours massaging my own leg trying to fall asleep. 
During my massage  I heard a dog barking.  Then I heard another dog barking from what seemed like the other side of the mountain.  Soon they were howling, and it dawned on me that these are Coyotes! Other than that I saw no amazing wildlife through my screen.  
I woke up feeling fairly well rested.  Had a pop tart for breakfast and packed up.  I was ready to hit the trail by 7:30 this morning.  It turns out there was a grocery store in 5 miles. The word on the trail is that they also serve hot food and other hiker delights.  
I took off first.  The terrain was nice with rolling hills and soft pine needles.  After about 4.5 miles I came upon a clearing.  The sun just popped out and right there in front of me was a magnificent Mountain View.   There was a light breeze all day and at times it would bring the fragrance of mountain flowers with it.  I got one of those nice breezes while enjoying the view.  
Just about a quarter of a mile further was a suspension bridge.   It was fun and a little scary to cross. I was careful not to make it sway too much.  
Right after the bridge I came to a road.  This is the road to Trent’s Grocery Store. That is when I learned Trent’s is 0.5 miles off trail. Guthook’s app made it appear as though it were right on Trail.  Hmmm...dilemma. The tramily had all agreed to meet there so I went.   I’m glad I did!   It was the cutest little store that served up hot food too.  I had a slice of pizza, 2 diet Dr Peppers, and an ice cream sandwich!   Hugs and Big Kahuna arrived before I started eating.   We all filled our bellies and hiked the 0.5 miles back to the trail feeling happy!  
I started out in front again.  When I came to the next blue blaze I just waited there for the other two.  This blaze went to a waterfall it was 0.3 miles off trail.  All of these things add up when lugging a 32lb pack. In the end we all decided to go see Dismal Falls. 
Before we reached the falls we could hear laughter.  It sounded like a party!   Dismal Falls was a great little swimming hole. The water was ice cold, but Big Kahuna rode the falls down and took a dip.  Hugs and I stayed on the rocks soaking our feet and knees.  It was a lot of fun!  Today’s photo is of other hikers down  at the swimming hole.  The coolest thing happened there.  A beautiful butterfly landed on Big Kahuna’s foot and wouldn’t leave.  Eventually he scooped it up with his index finger and it just sat there.  He blew on it gently until it finally flew away.  
The next few miles of our hike were a little on the rocky side.  I had to be careful where I planted my feet. The soft breeze was still blowing though. That was especially nice when I passed a small pine forest.  That breeze makes every rock worth it. 
Hugs had taken the lead  in a section with lots of rhododendrons.  She stopped short when she came upon a deer standing right there halfway on the path.  I was able to get a good view before she trotted off into the rhododendrons.  Another doe.  I’m beginning to wonder why we’re only seeing Doe’s.  There’s got to be a buck somewhere! The excitement from seeing a deer re-energized us for the remainder of our hike. 
We knew we had one last big climb before we would reach our tent site. In preparation for a big climb we usually camel up, and eat a little something sweet.  There were two water sources on our way to the top. We chose to go to the second one so we would haul our water the least distance. Water is heavy!  We ate a candy bar and started up.  
There was a couple of hikers sitting by the first water source.  It was a little creek with a nice wooden footbridge over it. The water was inviting, but we hurried past them because we knew tent sites were limited up there. We wanted to get there ahead of them. We trudged on to water source #2.  It was down to a trickle but we had to make it work.  This would be our only water for many miles.   Collecting trickles of water takes forever. Of course the other two hikers passed right by us. 
It was getting late by now.  Two blue blazes really ate up our time, and this UP was kicking our butts!  It was only 3,917ft elevation, but was nearly straight up.  There were still lots of rocks too.  My feet actually hurt from all the rocks.  
By the time we summited we were all exhausted.  All 3 of us put up our tents in silence.  I decided to cook because I ate cold food last night. It was a Mountain House meal of Italian Pepper Steak.   Quite tasty!  I shared with Hugs and Big Kahuna.  
We all retreated to our tents to recover from the day.  Tomorrow will be another big one.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593355,"I took the lead early this morning and found myself alone in a short while. The terrain continued to be rocky which is painful on these poor feet.  Myself and Big Kahuna both say our feet feel like they are bruised.  
Nonetheless I love hiking alone in the mornings. I was serenaded with lots of different tweets and whistles by all the birdies in the woods.  Morning birds are one of my favorite things.  
Not only was it rocky, but much of the woods I hiked through this morning had been burned.  It’s hard to tell if these were controlled burns, or remnants of a forest fire. The area affected was quite large.   
Once I made it out of the burned area things changed for a bit.  The trail temporarily became much less rocky, and I found myself in a tunnel of Mountain Laurel.  The Mountain Laurel is just soooo beautiful right now!  
We all came together again about 5 miles in.  I continued to lead as the trail took us to some views.  Our first place had a view on both sides.  Both sides were of towns below.  One of them was of Pearisburg( pronounced Paris-Burg) the town we’re planning to visit today.  I’m not sure if the other side was more of Pearisburg or not.  It didn’t matter anyway because the only thing I really saw was a small patch of beautiful flowers. The color just popped with a background of greens. They are today’s photo.  
We were all 3 pretty much together the rest of the day but I was slightly ahead.  Just enough ahead that I was alone when I looked up at a deer close enough to count how many times she blinked her eyes.  We both just stood there for what felt like a long time. I was hoping the others would arrive in time to see her.  That didn’t happen.  When I reached for my phone she trotted away and took cover in the rhododendrons.  That was my favorite moment of the day.  Everything was in slow motion.  
I stood there until Hugs arrived. She was first to show. She took the lead, and took us all the way down to our end point.  It was Cross Ave.  waiting for us there was a shuttle driver named Tom.  Tom could use a lesson in politeness. But he took us to the Post Office, Rite Aid, and finally the Holiday Inn Express.  
Tomorrow will be a zero day. My body needs a rest.  Right now I’m comfy cozy in a fancy hotel bed.  It’s heavenly!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593627,"Our shuttle arrived at 9am this morning. We used Don this time, and he was great!   He drove us to the road by Angels Rest Rock where we left off two days ago. 
I took the lead this morning.  There was a little up and a little down, but the path was mostly packed dirt or slightly muddy.  Rocks and roots were at a minimum and that’s great!  
I hiked through the woods to an open grassy area that eventually led to a road I had to cross. But when I got to the open area l turned around and took a picture of where I had just been. It wasn’t a big up or anything, but it was beautiful. I sometimes look back and say to myself wow I was all the way up there! 
I waited at the road for the rest of my tramily.  We took a break and admired the wild strawberries that are just turning red.  I didn’t know, but Big Kahuna had already eaten one a little ways back.  I’m giving them a few more days to ripen before I start eating.  
The insects are bad today!  I put on repellent twice and still got bites.  The bug net Papa Big Swig got me is a blessing.  I always feel like I’m a bee keeper when I wear it.  
When we left from our break it started UP. But really the path was perfect.  Soft and flat.  That was great for my back and hip that I’ve been nursing.   
Not far up the path I began to smell a stench... a horrible rancid stench!  Through the trees I could see where they are drilling the pipeline.  I have no idea what gasses they are releasing from the earth but they’re probably toxic.  I hiked by that as quickly as possible.  
I forgot all about that smell when my perfect path led me through a nice hallway of Mountain Laurel.   It just lights up the forest!  
I came down out of that mountain to a road at the gap.  The sign said road closed, and  a police officer was monitoring hiker traffic.  There were no cars.  She directed me to the next up point of the A.T. and gave explicit directions how far to stay away from the work zone.  Our shuttle driver told us we may see law enforcement as there have been issues with protesters.  I still have not researched how this pipeline will affect the A.T., but over all I’m pretty sure I protest it too.   
Despite construction going on, the birds kept singing.  I tuned out the construction noise and dialed in to chirps and whistles.   My favorite radio station! 
I sat down on a rock for a while and waited for Hugs and Big Kahuna.  When they arrived I learned that they had already taken a break without me, so they moved on.  I wasn’t far behind, and soon caught up. 
The trail became a road. It was much like Abandoned Road, and Hugs even mentioned that.  About a half mile down Big Kahuna said he had not seen a white blaze in a while.  One quick check with Guthook’s app and his suspicion was confirmed.  Ugghhh!  We turned around and walked a half mile back.  That added a whole mile we don’t get credit for onto our day.  Good thing this day was a planned Nero. 
We only had about a mile to go when the terrain made a change.  My perfect trail became a perfectly rocky trail, and it was all UP  
I was back in front again clanking my poles on the rocks. That noise of poles on rocks must really scare the bears, because before long a small one ran across the path in front of me and down the mountain.  It wasn’t a cub, but definitely not full grown either.  That’s the first time I’ve seen a bear run down hill.  They usually always run up. 
We passed a piped spring on our way to the shelter.  We all needed water, but Didn’t want to carry it with our fully loaded packs.  It was a joint decision to come back after we drop our packs.  By the time we reached our shelter we could see the rain coming in.  Big Kahuna took one for the team and went back to fill all of our water bags.   He got soaked when the rains came down. Not a complaint when he returned.  
There were a few hikers here and more showed up during the rain, but they all moved on.  One was Medicine Man and Tanker just arrived.  He’ll be moving on too.  
I’m about to make Mountain House Turkey and stuffing for dinner.

",Rice Field Shelter,"Jun 10, Sun",7.70
Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593942,"Woke up a little chilly this morning in the Rice Field Shelter.  One other hiker had showed up well after dark last night. He woke us all up cooking his food. Then he fixed his sleeping space beside me.  He’s very hard of hearing. The only way to communicate is by shouting.  He hiked 10 hours yesterday from Pearsburg to here.  That’s not very far for that amount of time. He still wasn’t really up when we headed out after 8am this morning.  
Packing up I could feel the rain in the air. So I got out my newly sized fancy rain gear.  It fit my backpack properly! I’m so happy!  
Today was another great day for flowers.  There are some new purple ones, and of course more strawberries.  When I see all of the new wildflowers it makes me think of Ms.Thelma. She’s my sister-in-law’s mom, and she loves flowers.  I think she would actually love this hike if it weren’t for all the mountains! Haha!  
I was in the lead for the most part this morning.  The terrain was good at that time, and it was so peaceful.  Once again the only sound was my favorite radio station birdies, tweets, and chirps.  It just puts my whole being at ease. 
We took a little break about 1100 am. I found a place with logs at just the right height for sitting. Big Kahuna caught a tiny baby toad while we were there!  It’s the little things that make us smile. As always he gently released the toad after our standard photo session.  
Leaving break I was in the lead. The path became a road of sorts.  I had that Abandoned Road feeling again.  One quick Guthook’s check and this time it turns out I was still on the right path. Thank you Jesus!  
Soon I could hear the work on the pipeline going on to my left. I could see glimpses of it down through the trees.  There were signs posted along the trail where the pipeline would be coming through.  I tried not to think about it too much. The realization came to me that our class of 2018 will be the last class to hike the A.T. the way it was meant to be.  I’m glad I have the opportunity.  
A few hundred feet further up the path I heard a rustling in the leaves to my right.  I looked over and there stood a beautiful doe.  Hugs came up quietly behind me and we were able to enjoy her for a good while.  She wasn’t afraid at all, was just twitching her little tail.  Big Kahuna arrived in time to see her too.  I’m still perplexed as to why we never see a buck?!? 
As we walked on we discussed the pipeline signs.  Hugs said they’re going to actually take the tops right off of some of these mountains.  That really makes me sad. Soon our little doe will need to go find a new home.  
A little ways further up the “road” the A.T. took a sharp turn to the left going back into the woods. The road however kept going straight.  Sitting there where the A.T. and the road parted ways was a guard in a gator. He was making sure we kept our distance from the pipeline procedures.  
At first I waved at the guard and kept on going, but I didn’t get 20 ft down the path before I remembered my trash.  I had left our hotel yesterday without emptying my hiker trash. I couldn’t believe I did that!  I’m out here for 5 days this time and I knew I wouldn’t have room for it and all the trash to come. So I turned around and asked the guard for a favor.  He very kindly relieved me of my trash.  
We talked about the pipeline a little bit.  He really isn’t for it either, but this was a job opportunity for him and he took it. He asked a lot of questions about my hike, and was shocked to know that I had REALLY walked over 600 miles. I told him my bear story while in the Smokies. He said “there’s no bears around here right?”   I had to tell him I just saw one yesterday. The look on his face was priceless!  I giggled a little.  
I thanked him and hurried along to catch back up with my tramily.  I was beginning to hear the thunder in the distance and we had about 4.5 miles to our destination.  The terrain had become rocky. I overlooked the rocks because there were beautiful ferns on both sides of the trail with peach colored Azaleas blooming throughout.  
The rain held off until there was only 2.5 miles left to go.  The rain wasn’t heavy and it cooled things down nicely. I was so happy with my new Packa rain gear!  
The coolest thing about today’s rain was that the showers started just as we entered an area filled with Mountain Laurel.  It was just beautiful, like the sun was still brightly shining through the rain!  Hugs took the lead as we made our way to the shelter. It was all switchbacks down that mountain side of Laurel.  
We’re in a shelter again tonight.  I much prefer my tent, but a wet tent is heavy,  so here I am.  Dinner was mashed potatoes with chicken and a mini moon-pie for dessert.   I’m full and happy.

",Pine Swamp Branch Shelter,"Jun 11, Mon",12.60
Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594050,"It was chilly again this morning after a night of thunderstorms.   We all slept well in our shelter. It was just the three of us, and I like that.  However, it turns out that our shelter was suppose to be closed to overnight sleeping.  That explains why nobody else joined us.  Another hiker stopped by this morning and told us the Gypsy Moths have damaged trees, and they were falling. It was closed for both sheltering and tenting, but there was one tent set up by us too.  Thank God no trees fell during the storm and we’re all alive to tell our story.  
I made myself some hot tea this morning. It warmed me up and helped wash down my tortilla with Nutella and baby bell cheese. Then a SOBO stopped by looking for his stepfather who happened to be the hiker who is very hard of hearing. He had packed in some Oreos for his stepdad and shared a few with us.  Now my breakfast was complete! 
I started out in the lead again today.  It was chilly and overcast, but my first half mile was great. I was hiking beside a river with a few small rapids. That sound of rushing water gets me energized. Trust me I needed that energy! The next 3.5 miles were very difficult!  Those Gypsy Moths really did a number on the trees. Lots of trees have fallen. I was forever climbing over or squatting under fallen trees.  Squatting with a full pack isn’t that difficult...getting back up is.  I had to drop my pack once in order to squeeze between limbs.   Hugs counted 21 trees in our path, but I’m sure there were hundreds down that were not on the trail.  It was a tough hike!  To top it all off, I was going UP.   
When I made my way out of the fallen trees area the trail became rocks.  Everything was wet since it had stormed last night, and I knew I was in for some cautious steps.  For the next 3 hours I could not look anywhere but down if my feet were moving.  Many times I would think my feet were safely planted on a rock only to have it move when my weight shifted.  That wouldn’t be so bad except once it leaned a different direction my feet started sliding because of all the wet moss.  My trekking poles were put to good use today. By the time I made my way out of those rocks I was physically and mentally exhausted.  It was all UP too. 
I came to a false summit with a parking lot and waited there for Hugs and Big Kahuna. There was a sign directing folks to Wind Rock for the great view at 4,019ft elevation.  I had already hiked almost the whole way up so I thought I would give it a try. It was still overcast so no view. Just a gray abyss. I tried to call Papa Big Swig since I was up that high, but not a good enough signal for that either.  Turns out Wind Rock was just extra steps.  
Leaving Wind Rock the terrain quickly changed to a softer flatter surface. Those beautiful ferns were on both sides again with vibrant splashes of orange colored Azaleas throughout.  This was the highlight of my hike today. 
Until...
I found myself looking at another Doe. She was grazing beside the trail.  I stopped walking and pulled out my camera.  She didn’t flinch at all.  As a matter of fact she kept grazing and walking towards me.  Not close enough to touch her, but really really close.  She would look up at me and move closer. Hugs was behind me and saw what was happening so she stopped.  The deer did the same thing to Hugs, then to Big Kahuna too!  It was the coolest thing!  Blessed blessed blessed! My very most favorite part of the day! 
I only had about two more miles to reach the shelter.  It was all ridge hiking, and it was all down. I turned at a switchback and found myself in Mountain Laurel happiness again!  I know I talk about Mountain Laurel a lot, but it’s honestly like someone just flipped on the lights. My pictures never do it justice, but for real no matter how dreary or foggy it really is, for that time it’s like the sun is shining and there’s only happiness. I wish EVERYBODY could experience what it’s like!  
The shelter was pretty full tonight so I chose to pitch my tent. The other hikers had already built a fire.  They got caught in the rain last night and were drying their wet clothes.  The three of us cooked our dinners and played cards by the fire until 8pm. That’s hikers midnight.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594141,"I slept great in my tent last night.  My eyes opened up at 5:48am to the sounds of other hikers getting ready to start their day.  I guess I wasn’t quite ready to start mine, because the next time I looked at my watch it was 6:40am! 
Breakfast was a high calorie cliff bar with some cheese.  I washed that down with some tang.  Tang has become my drink of choice lately.  
There was a SOBO getting her gear together at the same time I was.  We were both a little behind and a little disorganized, but our conversation was great!   She is from England and she’s here to hike the southern half of the A.T. From Harpers Ferry to Springer. She’s already hiked the PCT and part of the CDT. She’s also done the Camino.  That’s what really got my attention. Papa Big Swig and I are looking into that as a 2020 adventure.   It’s a 500+ miles hike, but every night you stay in a hostel or a church. It’s really a pilgrimage that starts in France and ends in Spain at St.James Cathedral.  I’m looking forward to it!  The rest of my tramily is coming too!  It will be a 2020 Tramily reunion.  
We all said our goodbyes and the pleasantries ended there. The trail said...Good morning Blue Raccoon, you will now begin your straight up climb for 2.5 hours up to 3730ft elevation to Kelly Knob. No switchbacks, and plenty of rocks.   Wowzers!   I was feeling the burn!  My gluteus Maximus was on fire!!!  
Don’t get me wrong, there were some beautiful sections.  I saw an area of small white pines. Their needles were so soft and fragile. New growth always makes me smile.  And of course my Mountain Laurel!  
I hiked the whole way up alone.  I really like hiking alone.  It gives me time to think.  I bet I have a hundred different conversations with myself everyday.  Today I was thinking about food.  I’m on day 4 with only trail food and right now I want some of Papa Big Swig ‘s spaghetti with a fresh salad.  He makes the best spaghetti sauce, and the best salads.  
I took a break after Kelly Knob at the next shelter.  My tramily met me there.  
We hiked the next mile or two together. In the woods it was dark and dreary all day. Clouds were looming overhead. The humidity was a force to be reckoned with too. To be fair we were ALL pretty uncomfortable.  But then suddenly in true Trail fashion, we popped out of the woods into a beautiful sunny open pasture!  Hugs had to look back in amazement.  She said “It’s hard to believe we were just in there, and now it’s like this!”  
The next mile or so was all pasture with cows in the distance.  There were a lot of orange and brown butterflies flitting around.  I really enjoy watching them dance from flower to flower. 
Eventually the pasture hiking ended on a road past an old barn.  I loved the smell of wet straw and fresh round hay bales as I hiked past the barn.  It reminded me of my horse racing days. 
The niceties ended again.  Another UP just as difficult as the first one.  Thunder was beginning to get close and I knew this was going to be tough.  Tough wasn’t  the word. It was grueling!  
My hike did take me past a 300 year old oak tree.  It was truly a grand thing to see. Not only was the trunk big and round, the limbs were too. Just as I left the Oak tree a red bird flew right in front of me.  I thought it was a cardinal, but Hugs had one fly in front of her too and it was not. 
So many times I wanted to just stop and pitch my tent right there on the rocks, but I could here my dad say “c’mon Sis you can do this”.  So I did.  I could even envision his face and he was smiling.   That was the best part of my day.  
The rain showers came.  They were light showers and it made the air feel heavier.  I was hoping it would cool things down.  Nonetheless I trudged on all the way to Sarver Hollow Shelter.  I had consumed 4 liters of water today, and probably sweat every ounce of it back out.  
Dinner was chicken & dumplings Mountain House meal and another liter of water. I think I’m finally rehydrated.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594231,"I woke up this morning to a deer grazing behind the shelter, and while I was packing up my gear another deer walked right by slowly. Still no bucks!  
I was dreading leaving the shelter this morning as it was 0.4 miles off trail and  straight down the mountain side. Hiking back to the trail would be straight UP that same steep mountain side. 
There were three other hikers with us last night.  One was a cartographer.  I’m not sure I’ve ever met a cartographer before.  Another was an older gentleman who didn’t have a lot to say, then there was Frog.  
We have been playing leapfrog with frog and his tramily the past 3 days.  He is ahead of them now. He’s a quiet guy who mostly stays off to himself.  He’s also a smoker so that might be why.  He carries his tobacco and rolls his own cigarettes. I haven’t seen that in years!  Anyway we learned he has two daughters. I think 6 years and 8 years old. He lights up when he talks about them.  Turns out he’s retired military.  He was in the first Gulf War and while raiding a bomb house he was severely injured.  His job was to stand guard outside a window and a bomb went off on the second floor.  I can’t remember all of his injuries but to name a few, vertebral fractures, femur fracture, third degree burns to left arm, and he nearly lost part of his right hand.  No wonder he’s often lost in thought.   There’s more than meets the eye with him. 
So up and out we went. I was in the lead, but we pretty much stayed together.  We found ourselves on a ridge with lots of rocks.  The view was amazing for miles of ridge hiking. The problem is the rocks! They were huge boulders that slanted. Often times they slanted right down the side of the mountain.  One slip down there would be death for sure. Lucky for us, when Hugs and I fell today, our wet boulders were slanted towards more trail.  I’m soooo tired of falling!  I landed square on my butt so hard it took my breath away.  
I took a minute to assess myself before I continued on, but the trail improved from there. Together the three of us found our sign marking the Eastern Continental Divide, and we crossed over.  I’m officially hiking in the Eastern part of the USA now!  I’ve been looking forward to this.   
I had two awesome animal sightings today. The first one was a box turtle, and she was right on the trail.  She was hustling pretty fast for a turtle too!  Hope she doesn’t beat me to Katahdin! The second sighting was a black snake climbing a tree.  This snake was at least 5ft long maybe 4inches around.  He’s my photo of the day.  
Shortly after our photo session with the snake we saw a cute little Rat Terrier bouncing up the trail. Close behind was his human. That was Joe.  Joe is the owner of 4 Pines Hostel and our ride to civilization.  
This hostel leaves a lot to be desired, but it’s like a great big trail reunion!  Tahoe Jimmy is here, Robin is here, my favorite trail dog Melvin is here, Giggles is here, Minksy and lots of others.  I’ve seen Jams electronics, but no Jams yet.  Looking forward to seeing him. 
We were shuttled to The Home Place for dinner. It’s an all you can eat served family style restaurant here in Catawba VA.  They are only open Thursdays through Sunday. Look it up, there’s a little history to the place.  It’s a beautiful old house, and the food was excellent!  I’m miserably full.  
We’re planning on playing a little cards tonight.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594327,"After a long night of mostly being awake, I finally crawled out of my bunk around 6:30 this morning.  Most other hikers were already up and dressed. Several had hit the trail.   I was able to say goodbye to Tahoe Jimmy, Stokes and his dog Melvin, Giggles, Chooey, and a few others.  
Stokes and Melvin completed their hike yesterday.  I think he did half last year and half this year. So he’s not a “thru-hiker” but he has hiked the whole Appalachian Trail.  Melvin has too! 
We had a new shuttle driver this morning. He’s in training, and he couldn’t find our drop off site.  We were riding on the floor in the back of a van.  I’m usually okay with that, but on the winding mountain roads was a bit much. It took him an hour to get us there.  I barely made it without vomiting, and when we did arrive it took me a few minutes to calm my belly before I could begin  hiking.  
We pretty much stayed together today. The terrain was nice and we had a slack pack nero planned.  
Within 5 minutes into the woods we saw Groucho. He was putting out a campfire someone had left unattended. It was right beside a stream, so there’s no excuse for whoever did that. Groucho is a thru-hiker. He’s slacking the whole way with help from his wife.  He flip flops regularly so we see him often.  
Then we started UP.  I had not looked at AWOL or Guthook’s to know what to expect today, but with a slack pack it just seemed to fly by.  Big Kahuna as much as said it...”We’re flying!” The next thing i knew there I was on the summit.  I said wow we knocked that out in no time!  Hugs just giggled.  It was a false summit.  I think there was 1700ft left to go.  
I needed to find the ladies room so I sent them ahead.  Groucho wasn’t far behind so I waited on him to pass too.  I put my poles on a tree and chose another one to squat behind. As my bladder began to empty I felt a sting on my low right leg.  I looked down just in time to see the swarm begin. I was peeing on an entire nest of ground bees!  15 or 20 of them began to swarm me.  I dropped my toilet paper and ran down the trail pulling up my pants.  They followed me for a couple hundred feet. Three stings!  Three stings!   No toilet paper now...and for crying out loud my trekking poles are still on that other tree!   You’ve got to be kidding me! 
Back I went without incident.  I grabbed my poles, but forfeited the T.P.    My right lower leg was stinging like nobody’s business. I was literally trembling from the attack.  All I knew was that I had to get to Hugs and pray she had put the anti-sting wipes in her slack-pack.  She had! It burned to wipe on, but I gave it a minute to work...nothing.  I tried to hike on, but the burning was relentless.  What can I do? Remember that Benadryl Hugs had picked up from the hiker box at the old school house?  She had that with her too. Once again Hugs was my Trail Angel!  Believe it or not, it still burns a little bit, but I’m lots better, and a little drowsy from the Benadryl.  
We continued going up to the Audie Murphy memorial.  3095ft elevation. Big Kahuna was looking forward to this.  He told us the story of Audie Murphy being a highly decorated WW II Veteran. I believe he also did some acting later in life.  Sadly on May 28th 1971 he died in a plane crash right there on that mountain. The monument has grown with rocks and memorabilia from many soldiers.  Hugs counted 10 dog tags.  I saw so many things that brought tears to my eyes.  I think we were all a little teary eyed. Today’s photo is of Big Kahuna,  a 40 year Veteran of the United States Air Force.  Thank you for your service Big Kahuna.  I have so much more to say about this, but the tears won’t let me type right now. 
And so we left the memorial together.  Hugs led our tramily down the mountain where our shuttle driver was waiting.  He knew the way home!  I also sat up front in the Captains chair.   We were back at the hostel for less than 15 minutes before Papa Big Swig showed up.  Surprise! 
I’m going to be off trail the next 4 days for a very special family event.  I will fill you all in on it when the day comes.  In the meantime I will use the next couple of days to answer questions from my guest book, upload a bunch of photos, and prepare for my return.  I will be hiking Dragons Tooth on the 20th and I hear it’s a rough climb.

Papa Big Swig was beside me, and my two favorite 4 legged people were at my feet. We had a typical hotel breakfast before setting out on the last leg of our journey to Paducah. 
I’ve spent a few hours of ride time uploading photos to Trail Journals. This is a much more difficult task than I anticipated. For one thing, the locations of these photos are all askew in my brain! But I want you to see them, so I hope you enjoy. Secondly, almost every photo has to be edited to fit within Trail Journals parameters. Keep looking back for new ones though. I hope to get them all in over the next couple of days.  Today’s featured photo is an up close shot of Mountain Laurel in bloom. This photo was given to me compliments of Hugs.  
Let’s talk about Hugs and Big Kahuna. They are my Tramily, and sure to be life long friends.  We’re a pretty cohesive group.  Big Kahuna is always the early riser and he systematically prepares us all for the day. He always retrieves our bear bags that he hung for us the night before. He usually wakes me up first as I need extra time to put in contacts and prep for the day.  Hugs usually sleeps in the latest. I don’t think mornings are her most favorite time of day. That being said, she is always ready when the time comes. It takes me a good hour each morning to get my trail legs going. Oftentimes Hugs leads us out of camp. She is also usually the one to keep us informed of expected climbs or views that day.   Between the three of us she’s probably done the most research. I would miss a lot of awesome sights if not for her.  After the first hour I generally take over the lead. It regularly happens that we are separated by 5 or 10 minutes, so it’s very much like hiking alone. It is my practice to stop every couple of hours and drop pack to rest and rehydrate my body.  This is a time when we all come together again. We talk about what we’ve seen, what we’re thinking, and where our planned ending will be for the day. That’s when I come in. After 6 hours of hiking with 30+ pounds on our backs we’re ALL ready to drop pack right then and be done for the day. I’m usually the one who digs deep and pushes us through that last mile or two.  It’s the least popular role in our tramily!  But we always get there and we always love each other at the end of a day!  Big Kahuna 100% of the time makes sure us girls are safe and settled before he retreats to his tent for the night. The sun comes up and we repeat! That’s the skinny version of my wonderful tramily.  I’m so blessed to have them!  
About me...I’ve definitely had some a-ha moments. When you have 6-8 hours a day to be inside your own head a lot of rehashing goes on. I’ve come to many realizations about myself. Some good, some bad, but all of them healing in a way.  There’s lots more to review, but I think I need healed.  I’m grateful for the start.  
Blue Raccoon’s guest book question of the day:
Julianne
I've been reading your journal with enthusiasm since I am close to your age. I'm rooting for you hard to succeed, but getting a bit nervous since you haven't made it to the 1/3rd mark yet and it's been well over 2 months since you started. Have you thought about flip flopping to Katahdin and heading SOBO back to VA to finish up so that you won't arrive there after they close in October? Winter wouldn't be nearly be as big an obstacle in VA as it would be in ME in Oct/Nov if you couldn't make the deadline. I'm pulling for you every step of the way!
Thanks for your support Julianne!  Your concern is valid!  In the beginning I had this plan to start at Springer and end at Katahdin, the big coup des gras. I’ve come to the realization those are my plans , and HIS plans are not always mine.   I’m absolutely open to flip-flopping or whatever it takes to complete the trail this season.  I’m going to let the trail take the lead and do my best to soak it all up.  Either way I’ll be happy!  
We’ve arrived in Paducah now and I’m off to see my daughter and grands.  I’m super excited as it’s been 3 months!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594483,"My morning started at the Drury Inn, Paducah Kentucky.  Me and Papa Big Swig were in one bed, and my grandsons Gavin and Dawson were in the other. We all had a quick hotel breakfast and rushed to the theater.  We saw the morning matinee of Incredibles 2. Dawson had it figured out before the movie was halfway over. He’s a smart kid! 
I only have two more days before I get back on trail, so Papa Big Swig and I are enjoying the rest of Fathers Day/date day on our own.  Tomorrow all of the kids and grands will be in Paducah, so we’ll celebrate with them then.  
However, our “date day” consists of purchasing my food resupply, readying my pack, and doing laundry. I’m also planning my next food shipment location etc.  Logistics logistics logistics...
Papa Big Swig surprised me with a mani/pedi AND a massage! He wanted me to have a good Father’s Day.  Ha!! 
Since its Father’s Day, I’m going to hi-light my dad. After all, he’s why I’m doing this.  He was the one who always said “ I have faith in you sis”, “You can do it sis”, or any other words of confirmation I ever needed.  He made me strong and gave me confidence.  He taught me about nature, animals, the land, and so much more. I have far better pictures of him, but today’s photo is how I love to remember him!  I was blessed with the best dad a girl could ask for! 

Blue Raccoon’s guest book question of the day:  
Hi Blue Raccoon! How's your back holding up? You mentioned that you had a steroid injection a little while back, so I hope that is helping. I'm sure the slips & falls don't help your lower back. If I was still on the trail, I would have been more than happy to try and give you some help with it. Sounds like, overall, you are doing great though. Keep on trekking! - Doc
Sunday, June 17, 2018
Hi Doc!  
Thanks for your concern. I definitely would have taken you up on some help with my back. I totally agree, if I could stay on my feet that would help a lot! Lucky for me, it’s much improved. Always a battle, but improved.  I’m seeing a chiropractor tomorrow just for good measure.  On a side note, Papa Big Swig and I are hoping we can meet up with you and your wife for dinner sometime after I’ve finished my hike. I’ll email my phone number to you. 
Hope all is well
Happy Father’s Day to all you dads out there!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594565,"Another morning at the Drury Inn. All kids and grands will be here tonight so I had to get moving fast. 
First was a visit to the chiropractor.  He’s new to me, but he’s a hiker! He’ll be my guy when I’m in Paducah from now on. 
Papa Big Swig did more laundry.  My hiking shorts came out with something red all over them.(hotel laundry facilities) I’m not buying new ones so red splotches on my shorts will be the new hiker fashion.  
Speaking of shorts.  They need taken in. I bought a size up because they were a little snug. That was not the right thing to do because they literally fall off when I’m hiking now. At 2:15 I’ll be seeing the seamstress to put a dart in the waist of my red splotchy shorts. Pretty sure she’s going to wonder why I don’t just buy new ones. They were $50 each...I’m choosing to wear the red splotches. 
All of my resupply is purchased. This includes food, a new phone charger, and replacement T.P. from the bee incident.  One hotel bed is now covered with hiking supplies.  Once my clothing gets a new permethrin treatment I’ll be repacking my backpack and clearing the extra bed for my son. I’m so excited that he can get away to stay the night with us tonight! 
My photo today is of Stokes and his dog Melvin.  They completed the trail the day I took that photo.  While I’m sure plenty of dogs have done it, Melvin is the only dog I personally know who has hiked the whole trail.  He’s really a great dog!  
Blue Raccoon ‘s guest book question of the day:  Vernon Savannah Ga.
I'm curious as to how the larger shoe / boot size is working out for you? ..... The only set-back I've found is that your regular shoes of the non-hiking variety start to feel waaay to small.
Monday, June 18, 2018
First I want to say that Vernon has been offering advice, answers, and support since I started this adventure. His advice is ALWAYS solid. I usually wear a size 9 shoe but my trail runners and boots are a 91/2. I did this based on Vernon’s advice and it was the best thing.  After battling horrible blisters since week 2 I have no blisters at all!  And Vernon, I wore my regular gym shoes today for the first time in 3 months. They do feel small.  
The kids are rolling in, so I’m ending here. Tomorrow is a big day for us. I can’t wait to share it!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594656,"Myself, Papa Big Swig, and my son Kyle woke up early. We all rushed around to get ready for the big day. We were at the courthouse by 8:15 this morning wearing our rainbow colored shirts.  
Why?  Because today my daughter Lisa and her husband Alan adopted the cutest little curly haired blonde I’ve ever seen!  She’s been with our family for a good while but today it’s official! 
Introducing Lucie Mae Francis Sullivan!  
We couldn’t be happier!  She requested everyone to wear a color of the rainbow for her adoption and party!  She’s a kid who loves colors, sparkles, and princesses! 
She wanted to take a sassy photo with me for the journal. As you can see, I obliged. There it is, the Nama and Lucie sassy pose! 
The party was wonderful!  We are always happy when all of the kids and grands can be in the same place at one time.  It doesn’t happen often enough.  
I got lots of hugs and well wishes regarding the A.T.   We’re back in the SUV and 10 hours from 4 Pines Hostel.  The mountains are calling and I must go!  Dragons tooth tomorrow!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594829,"Not sure where I woke up at this morning, but it was about a 2.5 hours drive to 4 pines hostel. An hour after my arrival Hugs and Big Kahuna arrived!  Back together again!  In my best Big Kahuna voice I was singing WE ARE TRAMILY!  
Off to a late start, we did a Nero flip flop slack pack. It was a hot one today, so taking it slow my first day back was a good plan for me.  Tomorrow we will do Dragons tooth and hopefully beat the heat.  
Today’s hike was fairly uneventful.  A few ups, a few downs, a couple of pastures.  No rock or root problems. We did see some pretty cool rock formations. A rock wall is my photo of the day.  
Coming down to a pasture we passed some wild raspberries.  Only a few were ripe enough to eat...so we ate those!  A little tart, but yummy.  
Shortly after the pasture we hiked along a stream that is fed by a boiling mountain spring.  It was a cool thing to see.  The hostel owner says he gets all of his water there and never filters it.  
We did a SOBO so our hike ended on the road where the hostel is located. We walked 0.3 miles up the hill and ended where we started.  
It’s official I’ve hiked 700 miles!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594936,"My alarm went off at 5:30 this morning.  Not that I needed one.  The 4 Pines Hostel rooster had been crowing for a few minutes already.  
Breakfast was poptarts and a clementine.  
We walked to our start and headed southbound to Dragons tooth.  The path was rocky.  Very rocky! We spent a fair amount of time scaling rock walls. It was dangerous in several places.  But dangerous or not, I loved this day!  Dragons Tooth was awesome!  
On our way up we crossed paths with another box turtle.  We must have scared him because he booked it as fast as a box turtle can go across the path.  His brakes didn’t work though and before I could help him he tumbled a couple of feet down the side. Wish I could have got him in time.   Hugs could see him down there and said he was upright.  I hope he didn’t get hurt.  
Shortly after the turtle wipeout we heard large animal movement off to the right. The forest is grown up now and we never did see what it was.  Based off of the noise and movement, my money would go on a bear.  
Today is National Hike Naked Day. I told myself when this adventure started that I will do what hikers do...and so I did. The whole tramily did our part to carry on the tradition.   It was crazy and fun!  I have photos, but my kids would die of embarrassment...so I won’t post them.  
The photo I chose for today is of Big Kahuna scaling one of the rock walls.  I’ll put the actual Dragons Tooth photo in the photo album so you can still see it. 
Our trek down was smooth sailing.  A few rocky areas, but mostly dirt. I like that.  
We beat our shuttle to the pick up location. It was right beside Trout Creek.  Trout Creek is crystal clear with a rocky bottom. Hugs saw a fish. We’re assuming it was a trout. 
Soon enough Finn our shuttle driver pulled up.  He got out for a quick look at the creek and drove us to the store.  Chips and soda for me, then back to the hostel.  
After a shower and laundry we shuttled to The Home Place and enjoyed one last all you can eat dinner served family style.   We were joined by Photon. He’s a thru-hiker who started May 13.  He hikes a marathon every day!  I’m feeling more and more stressed with my timeline.   
They say if you reach Harpers Ferry by the 4th of July you’re ok.  I won’t be there by the 4th, as I have one more time to be off trail this month.

Breakfast was a tortilla with almond butter, baby bell cheese, and leftover diet root beer.   Breakfast of champions!  
This will be my last morning at 4 Pines Hostel.   Can’t say I’m going to miss that place.  Hands down it is THE worst hostel I’ve stayed at. Ever!  However, I stayed there 4 nights, which is the longest time I’ve ever spent at one hostel.  It served its purpose, I was able to slack pack all around it.  
Today was a planned NERO. This is our first day full packing in over a week. My back needed the break. We hiked up to McAfee Knob at 3118ft elevation. We all had a little photo session, then hiked to the shelter 0.7 miles north.  We arrived early at 2pm, but went ahead and claimed a space.   
Big Kahuna went on a water run and returned with a nice bounty of blackberries!  They were perfectly ripe!  
Just as we started collecting wood for a fire, the rains came.  This shelter is a bit narrow. The bottom of my sleeping bag got damp...and the firewood is wet. 
So we sat inside the shelter and played Hearts.  I usually play Pitch so for me there’s been a learning curve. But today was my day! Winner winner chicken dinner!  
Except my dinner is a Mountain House turkey casserole.   Hot water with honey to drink and gummi-worms for dessert.  
Hoping to catch the sunset at McAffee Knob tonight. We’ll see if the weather cooperates.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595130,"I woke up at 5am to that wonderful sound of rain on a tin roof.  It was nice to sleep outside again.  That hostel was so hot and musty. The cool air was wonderful!
We were hoping to catch the sunrise this morning at McAfee Knob but the weather changed that plan. The same thing happened last night when we were going to try to catch the sunset.  
Two other hikers had joined us at the shelter last night. Wicked is a young guy from Massachusetts, and Incubator a young girl from Pennsylvania. It’s obvious how Wicked got his name. He’s wicked awesome!   Incubator got her name in the Smokies. She picked up her backpack after sleeping in a shelter and a mouse jumped out of it.  Upon further investigation a small nest with 4 babies was found inside.  Eek!   Hence the trail name incubator!  The first mile of my hike was ok.  There were more rocks than I like, but a lot of soft flat path too.   I came across the most pleasant smell coming from the tiniest little purple flowers. Wish I knew what they were. 
I had to do a little boulder climbing.  Nothing I needed to take my pack off for, but still took some strength.  Eventually I came down to a gap. I could see the start of a steep climb going up from there, so I decided to drop pack and take a break.  
We all came together during break and fueled up for the climb.  I lead the way straight up, no switchbacks, all the way to  Tinker Cliffs  2052ft elevation. 
The cliffs were super cool!  It was a series of cliffs overlooking the valley below.  Today’s photo is one of the views.  As I sat there enjoying myself a cloud came rolling in.  It was just a grey mist that eventually engulfed me completely.   A short while later it was gone.   
After it passed I took a moment up there to FaceTime Papa Big Swig.  He’s got our granddaughter Charley for the week.  I think they’re having a good time!  I’ve had fairly good cell service the past few days, but my FaceTime call dropped.   
There was a shelter just a couple of miles past Tinker Cliffs.  We agreed to stop there as it is the last water source for 9 or 10 miles.  Shortly after we re-supplied water, the rains came again.  We decided to just claim a space in the shelter and hike extra miles tomorrow into town.  We’ve had many short days in a row....
Not too much time passed before I had a blast from the past! It’s Reflex!!! I met her a long time ago up on Tray Mountain.  That was the time I was stuck in my tent for 11 hours because of bad weather.  Those winds were unbelievable!  Anyway, the last time I saw her was at Fontana Dam. She looks great! 
We had time for another game of Hearts. Hugs is current reigning champ.  I’ll be trying to change that in a few minutes.

",Lambert’s Meadow Shelter,"Jun 23, Sat",6
Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595215,"Our shelter became a very popular place last night.  Two other thru-hikers sheltered with us and several weekend tent-ers showed up.  We’re pretty certain this is because we were at the only water source for several miles either direction. 
One thru-hiker pitched his tent behind the bear boxes up by us.  The weekenders had to go down a hill and across the stream. There were lots of trees to hide behind down there, but if one of them wanted to use the privy(they all do)it was a steep climb back up. 
I was awakened at 5:28am by a very loud crack from a breaking tree. That sound was followed by psssssshhhhhh-BOOM!  A tree had fallen over by the tents. I popped up like a Jack-in-the-Box to make sure nobody was injured. By the grace of God everybody was safe, wide awake now, but safe. 
Our trail was rough today.  Lots of climbs and lots of rocks. Hugs led us out of camp and I took the lead on the first big up. Again the ups were just straight up. We were ridge hiking but the ridges were sawtooth.  
We exerted a lot of energy on the very first up, so I started looking for a place to break.  I found a little cubbyhole in the trees with 3 boulders about butt high.  We rested 10 minutes or so then put our packs back on.  We hiked about 20ft up and right there was a couple of big boulders with a great view.  I can’t believe we took a break in that little carved out space in the trees when we could have had that view. Today’s photo is of Hugs enjoying it for a moment. 
Coming down from the top there were nice switchbacks. Hugs had the lead.  At one point I looked up and she gave me the shhh sign and pointed. Over to our left was a beautiful young doe.  She was more standoff-ish than some of the others, but she didn’t run away.  She let us enjoy her for a good while before we moved on. 
We sort of separated after the deer.  I took the lead again.  We must have been coming to another UP. I’ve been pretty strong on the UPs lately.  Sometimes I even surprise myself!  When I reached the summit of the next UP things leveled out a bit. I decided to take advantage of the great terrain by walking fast.  That’s when I nearly stepped right on top of a box turtle! It wasn’t very big, and his shell just blended in with the trail. I recognized it at the very last second.   After the usual photo session I moved him off the trail. 
The rest of the trail was a ridge, but very rocky and up and down like a roller coaster. I know there is an area they actually call “the roller coaster”. It could  apply here too. 
Even though my feet were very sore from the rocks, the views were amazing! I had several views of a beautiful river. I walked by a few more berry bushes, and had nice breezes all day.  
Before I knew it I popped out onto a highway in Daleville Virginia. Wooohoo!  I went straight to the gas station and guzzled a root beer!  Hugs and Big Kahuna got a soda too.  Then we walked to a local BBQ place called Three Li’l Pigs. We definitely ate like three little pigs, and since we are thru-hikers we got free banana pudding for dessert!  
Right now my laundry is done. I’m freshly bathed, feeling fat and happy at the Holiday Inn Express! Don’t worry, I’ll be back out there tomorrow.

Hi Patti!  Thanks for the well wishes!  My derrière is no longer in pain. My back is much improved. It always hurts anyway, but is definitely better.  I’m glad you mentioned weight loss. I’ve been meaning to address this. It does look like I’ve lost a fair amount of weight, but it’s really only 3 or 4 pounds.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595359,"I woke up at 6am. It was a little dark outside for 6 o’clock so I figured it was already or would be raining today.  BUT, I was in a motel that serves hot breakfast at 6:30am,  so I started getting ready for the day. Put my contacts in, brushed my teeth and hair, got my clothing together. Once I was dressed I grabbed my phone to see if it was 6:30 yet....nope.  It was 5:20am!  Ugh!  My glasses are on the night stand tonight! 
Our shuttle driver arrived at 9am.  It was Homer Witcher!  Homer is a 76 year old legend on the trail.  In 2002 he thru-hiked with his wife and two children who were 8 and 11 years old at the time. There are a couple of books about them. I could talk forever about him, but time won’t allow, so please google his name.  I will add that two years ago at the young age of 74 Homer ran a full marathon in 4 hours!  He and his wife volunteer to maintain a portion of the A.T. to this day. 
Our hike began at Peaks of Otter Overlook.  A beautiful view from the get go!  I snapped a photo right then. It will be my photo of the day. The views kept coming all day long!  
I did a flip-flop slack pack today.  The terrain was great! 18.6 miles down and I still feel good.  It was very much like a stroll in the woods only with a few sweaty UPs.  The biggest climb today was just over 2500ft.  
The fun thing about a flip-flop is that I get to see all of the NOBO’s. I saw about 10 thru-hikers today.  I knew most of them, and said hi to both Wicked and Reflex over the course of the day.  
Late in the afternoon the trail grew wider than usual. It was like walking down a gravel road. I was far ahead from the others and just enjoyed listening to the birds chirping. There was light rain showers off and on all day. The tree canopy kept me mostly dry. I just enjoyed hearing the rain and getting an occasional cool breeze.  It was really really a pleasant day. 
During my time walking alone I came across two young deer grazing near the path. I took a picture from far away, but that was it. My presence made them nervous, and they trotted off.  
I came to a road and waited there for my tramily. We all three started out together from the road into a pasture and up a hill. I saw a few cow patties, but no cows. As I walked through the field I could hear mooing too, but still never saw a cow. That’s fine with me. The cows around here seem to have horns.  I’m not fond of that. 
As we were coming down towards the road where our hike would end there were two bunnies playing around. It made me think of Galesburg(my home town) there are soooo many rabbits in the Burg!  A Blue Jay was flying in and out of the pine trees along with several Robins.  I love seeing and hearing all of the birds.  
All too soon we popped out of the woods onto U.S. Route 220. We played Frogger across 4 lanes and walked straight to Kroger.  I bought some Naan and fresh Tuna Salad to put on it. I had chips with that and Watermelon for dessert. 
I’m exhausted tonight,  but for the record I am officially past the 1/3 mark now!  Wooo hooo!  I can’t wait to see what the last 2/3 brings!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595459,"I woke up a little late this morning at the Holiday Inn Express.  Our shuttle arrived at 8am and I ran out there with breakfast in my hand.  This hotel really offers a great breakfast!  
We were thinking of doing another flip flop slack pack but decided to start back at Peaks of Otter Overlook and go north.  Homers wife was our driver this morning. She’s just as lovely as he is.  We had great conversation.  
It was raining when I woke up this morning and it rained all day.   This rain was heavier and required my fancy new rain gear.  I love my Packa!  It was the best decision I’ve ever made about rain gear!  
The terrain again today was great.  There were occasional rocks and roots, but mostly soft dirt or sandy path.  Last year’s fallen leaves covered the trail in many places making it even softer, and sometimes colorful.  
I stopped for lunch at a shelter and was soon joined by Hugs and Big Kahuna.  It was nice to get out of the rain to eat.  After lunch I ran up the path a short distance to the privy. WOW! This was the Cadillac of privies!  It was very new made with fresh cut wood. There was a handrail, and nice vent pipe.   All I could smell was cedar...instead of...well you know. 
I put my rain gear back on and continued walking north. I noticed the fungi was enjoying the rain today. Mushrooms were popping up all over.  Lots of white ones, and every so often an orange one.  Until this hike I had no idea there were so many different kinds of mushrooms.
  I should know better than to keep walking while looking at mushrooms.  Sure enough I stepped on wet tree roots, and of course they were sloped downward. My left foot started sliding and I just knew I was going to land on my left hip.  Somehow I got my right foot planted in the dirt and saved myself. I still have no clue how that happened. There were no falls for me on this wet day! 
Over the course of the next mile I saw two deers. They were much bigger than any previous deer.  Their white tails were probably 8 to 10 inches long and they  stood straight up.  Until today the tails have been much shorter and they twitch them from side to side. 
I walked beside a stream quite a ways. It was flowing good from the rain.  It triggered a thought about the term “babbling brook”.  This brook babbled. It talked to me for about a mile.  I loved it! 
I hiked in to the second shelter. There were two ladies there. These were the only people I saw all day long. I hiked 7 hours today mostly alone. This shelter had a really nice privy too. Virginia does a fantastic job of maintaining the trail! I understand that most of it is done by volunteers like Homer and his wife. These people are a blessing to us hikers! 
Speaking of Homer.  Just past the second shelter we took a blue blaze for about a mile out to a gravel road. This is where Homer picked us up. He drove us to Stanimals Hostel in Glasgow, Virginia.  This place is lovely.  Dinner was all you can eat spaghetti at the only restaurant in town.  It was delicious!

Our shuttle driver today was Gary. Gary is a 63 year old retired police officer. He’s also a hiker. He took us back to our blue blaze where we left off yesterday, so we took the blue blaze back to the trail and started hiking north.  
Once we hit the real trail our hike started going UP. I took the lead.  Not far up I nearly stepped on a baby snake. I had myself convinced it was a baby rattler so I followed it until Hugs got there. I even did some video. Hugs gave it a close examination, and It was not a rattler at all. I was a little disappointed because I really want to see a rattler and a copperhead.  With that, I can say I saw all of the dangerous animals on my hike.  As of now I’ve only seen bears.  
I did get lucky and see another Hooded Oriole. I haven’t seen one of those since Erwin. Once again he was too fast for a photo, but I knew better than to chase him this time.  
I continued UP.  The grade wasn’t too bad but I was sweating. UP & UP for 2 hours to Cornelius Creek Shelter.  3700ft elevation!  
I left our lunch break first.  I love hiking with my tramily, but I also enjoy hiking alone. It gives me time to think. Today I was thinking a lot about my dad.  He loved nature, the earth, the forest, animals, even a good thunderstorm.   His dying wish was that we plant a tree in his memory.  
We were living in Florida at the time.(2006). We had a little acreage and dad managed that after he retired.  Him and mom lived on our back property.  Anyway, after he passed an old friend who owns a nursery picked out a nice sapling.  We had a few close friends and family come over for a tree planting.  It was placed so mom could see it from her sun room.   She watered the tree every day, and it did well.  Two years later we had an offer from the phosphate mines for our home and land.  Mom and myself were missing Galesburg friends and family, so we sold and moved back home.  But, we knew the mines would excavate our land and we didn’t want dad’s tree taken out. We also knew we couldn’t safely haul it to Illinois. So, to make a long story short our very dear friend Brenda Pelton handled it all. She moved dads tree to her family property right there  in Florida. She said she prayed to God for dad’s tree. First, it was the wrong time of year to be transplanting, and she knew it was special to us. On February 16 this year which is dads birthday and Larry Pelton’s(her husband) birthday she sent me a photo.  I can’t believe she’s taken care of dads tree for 10 years already!  Dads tree is today’s photo of the day.  
The last couple of miles were nice. I saw a big red headed woodpecker. He wasn’t pecking at the time, but he was on a fallen tree using his beak to move little branches. He was working hard until he saw me and flew away.  
I saw one more snake before I popped out of the woods to a road crossing.  I decided to wait for Hugs and Big Kahuna there.  After about 20 minutes I got a text that Hugs was not feeling well. She and Big Kahuna had take a blue blaze to a parking lot not far from where I was. 
Today is the day Papa Big Swig is picking me up for our planned family event, so he was close by.  He and my granddaughter Charley Faye drove over to pick us up.  
I’ll be off trail until July 1st.  This is my last scheduled time off trail. I do have a plan, and I can make Katahdin on time. I’m determined!  
I’ll journal a little something every day while I’m off trail

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595648,"We stayed at a hotel last night in Lexington, Virginia. I slept pretty good except when one of the dogs started whining to go outside. Papa Big Swig took her out, and the other one started whining.  He took her out too.  
I slept in until about 7am. The hotel breakfast was good.  Charley Faye and I started packing up, while Papa Big Swig loaded the SUV. 
Soon we were on our way to Cartersville, Georgia. We made a quick detour to Damascus and checked out some property.  We’re both interested, so who knows what our future holds.  
That’s the future though, let’s talk about right now.  Right now I’m planning the rest of my trek to Katahdin.  If possible, when I get back I really just want to go north all the way to the end.  If I can reach mile marker 1056 by July 31st, I can make it to Katahdin on time. 
Papa Big Swig will start slack packing me August 1st, and he’ll help me all the way to Katahdin.  I have a mileage chart that gives me one day to zero or nero every week.  I’m so determined!

I made a quick run to Target with my granddaughter.   I needed re-supplies and she needed slime supplies. We both found everything....including Starbucks.  
I was thinking about blue blazes today.  You know the saying “where in the blue blazes are we”?  I wonder if that has any origin from being lost while on a blue blaze?  I’ve been lost plenty of times on a blue blaze myself. 
My daughters and granddaughters have all arrived!  We’re at a hotel tonight and tomorrow is the big event!  It’s a gift to my sister-in-law Tammy.  A fancy “princess” party. If anybody ever deserved to be a princess for a day, it’s her!

It’s a new chain by Hilton called Home 2 Suites.  I want to go on record saying this is a really nice place!  Our dogs are allowed, the kitchenette is great, and the rooms are big. Our complimentary breakfast was actually a gourmet breakfast of sorts. 
My breakfast was a whole grain bagel sandwich with fried egg, pork sausage, and cheese. Hot tea to drink and a little cold cereal on the side.  They offer way more than that though.  
After breakfast we all went to the venue to help decorate. My daughters jumped right in with the event planner and helped get things done.  I helped too. I’m just not arts & crafty like they are.  I really love the way it turned out!  I think Tammy did too.  This was HER special day after all!  
While we prepared the venue Tammy went to the hairdresser.  She has very long hair, so she got a beautiful up-do. I hope her morning was relaxing and stress free. 
Papa Big Swig was the DJ, all of my granddaughters got to be little princesses. It was so much fun!  Papa Big Swig got to meet some of his family members that he’s never met before. 
Tammy and Maryann is my photo of the day.  When I talk about the “sisters-in-law”, it’s these two.  We love them to pieces!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596087,"13 of us had breakfast in the hotel dining room this morning. By 9am we were on our way to Sunset Field where Big Kahuna, Hugs, and I had ended our hike last Wednesday. 
All 13 of us plus both of our dogs started walking north.  The terrain was excellent!  It was mostly a packed dirt path with very few rocks and roots.  We did have some rocks and boulders about 1.4 miles in as we neared The Guillotine. 
The Guillotine is a rock formation on the trail.  It really does look like it could take somebody’s head off!  Today’s photo is of my daughter, her husband, their 8 kiddos, and another granddaughter who belongs to a different daughter, and Papa Big Swig standing underneath the guillotine.  They all have trail names now!  
After the Guillotine Papa Big Swig took a couple of the kids and our old dog back to the hotel.  Ice Princess was a little too small to keep up. The plan was always for her to go back with Papa Big Swig.  A few others didn’t appreciate our first big UP,  so they took advantage of the opportunity to spend extra time with Papa Big Swig. 
The rest of us hiked on to summit Apple Orchard Mountain at 4203ft elevation.  There was some kind of weather building/structure up there.  It was a huge round ball with antennas.  I felt like I was about to enter Epcot. My daughter Octo-mom loved the view from up there.  
The bugs were horrible today!  Those black gnats that bite were everywhere.  Anytime I stopped walking they swarmed my face. They were in my eyes, up my nose, and in my ears.  I even swallowed a couple of them.  I have bites all over my legs. My one leg has a chain of bites all the way around my sock line. It seemed the insect repellent didn’t affect them at all. I’ll remember my insect net for tomorrow.  Papa Big Swig bought nets for everybody else tonight.  
We hiked about 2.5 miles to Thunder Hill Shelter.  This is where we stopped for lunch.  Those biting gnats were there in full force too!  We managed to eat while swatting at insects the entire time.  
Once we left the shelter it cooled down a little bit.  There was unexpected cloud coverage which was nice. TCR hoped the rain would come...it didn’t. However the change in temp made those nasty gnats disappear.  That was better than rain!  The temperature felt good. It became perfect hiking weather.  
The rest of our hike was DOWN.  We were scooting along pretty good when Netflix heard a rattle snake. Tre J. saw it, and Seylor aggravated it. It tried to strike Seylor but missed.  It was a very big Timber Rattler!  I’m going to say at least three to four inches in diameter.  I couldn’t tell how long it was, but I got a good view of its rattles. I don’t know how to count rattles, but a good 1.5 to 2 inched had rattles. I took a couple of photos that weren’t very good, but you can see it in my photo album.  
After that excitement we continued DOWN.  There was one more stop with a view that we all enjoyed.  The kids really soaked that up!  They appreciated the view way more than the snake. I was just super excited to see the snake! 
We continued down until we popped out onto a road where we waited for Papa Big Swig to pick us up.   It was a great exciting hike!  
We had an ice cream treat before swimming at the hotel.   Tomorrow we’ll put our boots back on.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596166,"All of the grandkids decided to hike today except our littlest ( Ice Princess Lucie).  She stayed at the hotel with Papa Big Swig.  
My favorite 4 legged girl hiked today too.  Dragon Tamer thought Seylor should have the trail name “Blue Blazer”. She’s forever making her own blue blazes while ridding the world of varmints.  She’s a smart dog, but she just won’t follow commands when I call her Blue Blazer!
We had three or four views today, but the  full green trees obscured them all just a little bit. We still enjoyed what we could see.  Today’s photo is one of those views.  
 Our first climb was 3056ft up to Highcock  Knob. Tre J said “Nama, I can’t do this” I gave him a pep talk and he did it...they all did it!  I was so happy with them, impressed, and proud! 
We hiked down to a stream where we stopped for lunch.  Today was much hotter than yesterday, so several kids had drank all of their water before lunch.  They were excited to try creek water for the first time.  I collected and filtered about 3 liters for them. They’re all REAL hikers now! 
Just as we were packing up to leave, a SOBO thru-hiker showed up.  He said it sounded like a party was going on down there! Yes the kids are loud!  I was pretty sure we would have no hope of seeing a bear or a deer because of all the noise today...not a quiet moment.  Anyway, the hiker’s trail name is Sam Fox.  He’s a military guy and Sam is an acronym  for Special Air force Missions.  I didn’t ask about Fox.  He personally assisted two presidents and Vice Presidents.  We thanked him for his service, and the kids took a photo with him. 
We left our lunch break and started walking north.  Only about a hundred yards in we realized we were on the wrong path. We had to go almost all the way back, but once we were on the right path it was great. We were ridge hiking through a nice patch of blueberry bushes.  They were tasty!   
A few miles later we came upon another creek.  We decided to take a short break for water and to let the kids soak their feet.  It turned into a not so short super fun time!  Yeet-Ut caught a craw Daddy and unsuccessfully tried to get a salamander. We also saw a pretty big frog, and all of the kids got wet!  
My four legged friend and a group of us humans managed to get a good distance ahead after we left the creek.  Seylor sniffed out a deer and chased her up the mountain to a ridge above.  Myself, Tre J, Fashionista, Black Cat, Small Fry, and Netflix all got to watch it happen.  I didn’t think we stood a chance of seeing a deer, but thanks to Seylor, we did!  
All too soon we crossed a foot bridge over the James River. Then we were at the place where Papa Big Swig was to pick us up.  He wasn’t there. We realized there may have been some confusion as to the exact pick up location so Small Fry and I hiked an extra mile to the other potential pick up location.  Eventually he had us all in the van. 
We went to a Mexican restaurant for supper and had some pool and hot tub time.  Then Hugs and Big Kahuna arrived.  My tramily and my family are together!  
This was a great day!  All of the kids realized they CAN do it! It was a very hot day and they did 10.9 miles! Ranging in age from 10 to 14, they all finished strong! 
Feeling blessed!

Papa Big Swig is now gone for another month.   
Our day started out going UP.  BIg Kahuna led the way to the top of Bluff Mountain at 3351 ft elevation.  The terrain was pretty good going up, but it was hot and humid.  I was huffing and puffing way more than usual.  
We stopped at the summit and enjoyed another great view. There were old concrete steps up there to sit on.  So we did that and took a snack break.  Some section hikers stopped by and chatted for a while.  
I took the lead after lunch. Just as we left the summit we came to a marker for a little boy named Ottie Powell. He had wandered off from school at the age of four and was found dead at this location 7 miles away from school.  Hugs immediately said that boy didn’t wander there, he was taken.  I agree. The year was 1891 and I don’t think folks thought like that back in those days.  
The path started out great going down, but eventually became very rocky.  Down is rough on the knees but down with rocks is REALLY rough on the knees!  
There were several lizards basking on those warm rocks today.   I tried so many times to get a picture but they must sense me coming.  They’re extremely quick!  Earlier in the day I did get a nice picture of a beautiful blue butterfly.  
Eventually our path went back to a nice dirt trail, but those rocks had really slowed us down. Suddenly we realized we had only a few minutes before our shuttle would be there to get us. Big Kahuna took one for the team and jogged down to the road so our driver wouldn’t leave us.  Hugs and I eventually made our way down just as I swallowed my very last drop of water.  Perfect timing. 
We went to the only restaurant in town for supper.  I had a cheeseburger and fries.  Strawberry sundae for dessert.  I’m fat and happy in a comfy bed at the hostel right now.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596512,"I woke up at Stanimals Hostel after a great night of sleep.  Immediately I started gathering my things and preparing my big pack for a few days in the woods.  
Our room was upstairs. I was up and down the stairs many times this morning.  On one of my trips back up I found a Happy Birthday gift bag on my bed. It was a gift from Hugs even though my birthday is still 6 days away.  She had planned to give it to me later, but since we are in our big packs again with a full load of food she didn’t want to carry it! I laughed when she told me, but in the hiker world that’s absolutely a legit reason for an early birthday gift.  She was very thoughtful with her gift choices and it gave me a great start to my day.  
Our shuttle driver took us back to Punchbowl Overlook and we started walking north.  It was Up.  The air was heavy this morning but there were frequent breezes that helped a lot. About 30 minutes into my hike clouds started rolling in.  They kept the sun at bay and it was nice.   
I was enjoying my nice hike for a good hour and half when I came across a great big 800 mile marker made out of sticks.  I can’t believe it.  I’ve walked 800 miles! I took a minute to celebrate before hiking on.  
Hugs and Big Kahuna caught up to me before my little celebration so we started out together again. Hugs took the lead. Not too far up the path I heard some rustling of leaves on the right.  I looked up just in time to watch a doe run for cover in some trees. Yes, another doe.  Are there any bucks out here at all?  
Hugs took the lead. We were ridge hiking which is still my favorite and to the left of me was a creek.  I could hear the sound of rushing water all morning.  That sound just makes me happy!  
Another mile or so up the trail we came to a foot bridge.  Our creek had twisted and turned its way right under that bridge.  We decided to go ahead and take our lunch break there.  
We all dropped pack and kicked back for a bit.  We had a nice break, but the clouds overhead were getting darker. Before long I was feeling the sprinkle of rain.   We packed up and started walking north again. 
A very small ways into the woods I was surprised by a black snake on my left.  He was angry.  I’m pretty sure that I had accidentally hit him with my trekking pole.  That’s the second time this has happened.  I feel terrible because Black Snakes are our friends.  
I took the lead after the snake incident. The trail was still nice. Rain showers came and went, but the tree canopy kept me from getting wet.  Except for being wet with sweat.  Nothing was going to stop that! 
I came to a place where there was a small pine forest to my left.  I love the scent of pine. Today I took a picture of some pine cones.  I seem to associate them with winter, but here they are looking beautiful in July.  Through the pines I caught a glimpse of a river.  It was so pretty to view.  I took a photo of that too.   
Hugs and Big Kahuna were pretty close by when I saw another Black Snake. This one was coming down out of a tree. The cool thing about it is that the tree had a white blaze!  I HAD to take a picture of that too!  This is the epitome of the A.T. ...a black snake and a white blaze.  
After our photo session with that beauty I took the lead again.  I came to a sign saying the trail was temporarily relocated due to a bridge problem.  An arrow pointed out the detour path.  This is a good example of how the A.T. Is “approximately” 2190 miles long.  The fire near Hot Springs forced a 7 mile shuttle.  So I walked 7 miles less. Today’s detour took me the long way around so walked a little more.  The trail is ever changing.  
Once I completed the detour I hiked beside a creek all the way to Brown Mountain Creek Shelter.  This is where I stopped to wait for Hugs and Big Kahuna. The sun was shining when I arrived.  I felt like we could move on if we wanted to, but within minutes thunder was heard in the distance.  Minutes later it poured rain.   
We had enough time to get water, and quickly wash up in the creek before the rain came down, but we are here for the night.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596570,"We were up at 5:30 this morning and hit the trail by 7am.  It was a glorious morning!  Cooler than yesterday, and no humidity!  A perfect day for hiking right?!?
Wrong!   Our hike started UP.  It went up and up and up for 3 hours.  I was dragging the entire way.  Eventually I did reach the summit of Bald Knob at 4045 ft elevation. I was the last one there.  Actually I was the last one everywhere today.  The view was nice from the top though, and it turned out that Bald Knob wasn’t a bald at all!  
I really just wasn’t feeling it today.  At one point I texted Papa Big Swig and told him I’m getting off at Harpers Ferry.  I don’t really think it was the climb that got to me.   Maybe the climb plus my nearly 40 pound pack.  I don’t know exactly why, but I struggled today.  Mentally far more than physically.  
I decided to focus on my dad.  After all he’s the reason I’m out here.  As a child I spent a lot of time with him in the woods.  He was a hunter, and he took me with him often. I have such great memories of hunting with my childhood bestie, Rose. She and I would both go hunting with dad quite a bit. We always had a good time, and we are still friends to this day.  
We all had agreed to meet up at the next shelter for lunch.  When I finally caught up with Hugs and Big Kahuna they were sitting at the top of the blue blaze leading to the shelter. It was 0.5 miles down, and of course 0.5 miles back. I really needed water and the privy, so I dropped pack and made my way down. This turned into an extra mile that I don’t get credit for today.  
Hugs and Big Kahuna left ahead of me.  I grabbed a snack and started out again. My pack is heavy right now.  I have a full supply of food.  I’m guessing with two liters of water on board it probably weighs close to 40 pounds.  I sat down again about 1/4 mile up the trail.  I have not had a day like this since Georgia.  
Once I made myself get moving I saw another nice view, and shortly after that I came out of the woods onto a bald.  A real bald! The sun was shining and the views were amazing!  
There were a couple of balds and as I walked on I could see one had a beautiful field of Morning Glory’s.  That’s today’s photo.  Because it’s a weekend there were lots of locals today.  Two ladies talked with me about thru-hiking and made me feel like I was a celebrity!  My mood significantly improved for the moment.  Still no energy, but I had a smile on my face. Coming down off the balds I caught up with my tramily.  They were getting water and sitting for a few minutes.  By the time I sat down they were ready to hit the trail again. I sat there alone for a few minutes. 
Sitting alone has its perks.  A little red breasted bird(not a robin) landed very close beside me and started chirping up a storm.  It was so cute!  I got a photo and hope to figure out what kind it is. 
I had to say goodbye to my new little friend if I was ever going to finish my day.  About two miles later I caught my tramily again. They were at a Gap so I joined them. We all sat down for a snack. I had salmon. 
Believe it or not, I was the first one up and out of there.  As I was leaving Big Kahuna said “ you know where we are?”   I said where?  He said at a Gap...and GapIs short for UP! True words! 
I started UP.  Not far up the trail one of those red birds I had seen back in Atkins flew in front of me again.  I wish I knew what they were too.  They’re a brilliant red color. They may have other colors on them, I don’t know. They fly so quickly I have never gotten a good look.  
It was there at the tree of the red bird where first Hugs then Big Kahuna caught and passed me for the last time.  I had about 4 miles left to go.  I stopped every 15 minutes to rest my feet.  I’ve never been so lethargic!   
About 5:45pm I slothed my way up to the shelter where my tramily waited.  I couldn’t wait to drop my pack and hit the hay!  
Tomorrow’s a new day!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596694,"I woke up about 5:30 this morning.  Mulberry was already cooking his breakfast.  I met him last night.  He’s from Vegas(I think) but he knows Galesburg well.  He’s gotten off of the train there for a layover several times when traveling to visit his brother. 
I chose not to climb out of my sleeping bag at 5:30 though. It was really cold, 45 degrees cold in July!?!  I took 3 Advil on an empty belly and went back to sleep for another hour.  I still really wasn’t feeling it this morning.  
When I finally did rise the sun was a good ways up and it had warmed by 10 degrees at least.  I made coffee and ate a cinnamon pop tart.  I’ve only had strawberry pop tarts out here so Big Kahuna gifted me with something different.  It was delicious with my Starbucks instant coffee.  Starbucks really knows how to make an instant that tastes like fresh brewed.  
It was during my delicious breakfast when Big Kahuna said “uh-oh”. I looked over to see a plastic bag in his back pack had been chewed through...and the peanuts in another bag had been chewed on.  We had a mouse visit us last night!  We all hang our packs in the shelters, but those things climb up the rafters and jump on in!  I cautiously checked my pack.  I had gotten lucky! 
Between the coffee and words of encouragement from everyone around me, and from Papa Big Swig via text, I mustered up some energy and left camp first.  I still had to pray for strength. Slowly but surely it came.  This was absolutely divine intervention.  I started repeating out loud “I am not a quitter” & “ I can do this”.  Before long I was doing it, and loving it!  The idea of quitting is a past memory.  
I hiked alone pretty much all morning.  The crows were ruling a small part of the forest this morning.  One would caw then another would caw, and so on.  They were flying all around talking to each other.  Whatever was going on, it was a community effort! 
Right about then I started going UP. My tramily had agreed to meet at a shelter only 4.4 miles away.  It was UP the Whole way!  After yesterday my glutes were already sore, and by 10am this morning they were ON FIRE!  I don’t care how cool it was this morning, I was still sweating a whole lot on this UP. 
I finally came to a false summit which was a nice reprieve.  The trail split right there, I kept going straight.  Spy Rock is a blue blaze at this point, so that’s why the trail splits. 
At the split was a Ridge Runner( Logan).  Spy Rock draws a lot of local day hikers during this time of year, so a Ridge Runner is helpful.  He watched me walk past the split and up the trail a good little distance before he asked me if I was a thru-hiker.  After I said yes he pointed me back the other direction.  He totally could have done that a long time ago. The trail is not clearly marked right there. Nonetheless I was grateful that I didn’t hike all the way up to Spy Rock!  
I got myself back on trail and headed north up to Priest Mountain. There’s a waterfall near this area of the trail too, and several locals were out enjoying this beautiful day.  I met a couple of them who were possibly mother and son.(not sure). We spoke briefly and I asked if they would mind packing out my trash. I’ve got two more days left in the woods and my odor-proof bag was getting full.  They were super kind and gladly took the trash. I am so grateful!  
We said goodbye and I hiked on. About 2 miles later I found myself in a very peaceful part of the forest.  It was just me. So when I came upon a good log about butt high,  I decided to sit on it.  I waited there for my tramily. 
It was so peaceful and calming just sitting there!  It felt so nice that I was compelled to take a picture of the trail right there.  It’s today’s photo. I sat on that log about 25 minutes listening to forest sounds and watching wildlife. Squirrels were out in abundance today. There must have been nut  trees  in that area because these are the fattest grey squirrels I have ever seen!   
Hugs arrived first to my log. She told me they also went the wrong way at Spy Rock.  Only this time the Trail Runner let Big Kahuna go all the way up without correcting him.  He must have warned Hugs.  In talking with Logan the trail runner she learned that sometimes he doesn’t help the thru-hikers basically for giggles.  What a jerk!  If we decide to blue blaze on our own that’s one thing, but unintentional extra UP miles with a full pack is another.  
As soon as Big Kahuna arrived we continued UP to Priest Mountain Shelter.  That was a blue blaze we planned on taking. The cool thing about Priest Mountain Shelter is that everyone writes their confessions in that shelter’s log book.  This is why we planned our lunch break there, so we can read the confessions.  Some of them were hilarious, and some were just disgusting. I chose to do some selective reading. On the way up I had planned to write my confession, but I did not write it because my friend Honey Bear had written exactly what I would have said! And she said it so much better than I could have.  
This is not verbatim but basically she asked forgiveness for her sins of not digging deep enough holes when she needs to poop. She said they are more like a scratch on the earth, then she covers it with sticks and leaves when she’s done. She also pees pretty much right on the trail, and she clearly sees these things as only getting worse.  
I laughed so hard because I do the same things!  I mean I try to dig, but rocks and tree roots make it impossible to dig a 6 or 8 inch hole....especially when you need to go right then! Now that the grass and weeds are grown up tall on both sides of the path I just pick a tree right on the trail when I need to pee.  Why? Because there are snakes everywhere in the grass!  The struggle is real! 
Speaking of “going”...the privy at Priest Mountain Shelter was made of stainless steel.  That’s a first!  
I took the lead after our lunch break.  The terrain started out pretty good but quickly became rocky.  I couldn’t look up at all for fear of falling, but lots of butterflies kept flying around me. They were mostly the royal blue & black butterflies, but I saw some new light violet colored ones too.  
I kept going down for literally miles. I think nearly 5 miles total.  My left big toe started hurting on the way down. I checked it out tonight and it looks like the start of an ingrown toenail. Ouch! Anyway as I continued down I stepped on a spot with loose rocks and sure enough...down went McGinney!  No real damage done, but falling is not fun!  
We arrived at camp about 7pm. That’s late for us. The shelter was full so we came down here by Harpers Creek and pitched our tents.  
I had a Chicken and Rice Mountain House meal for supper.  It’s my new favorite!  Me and Big Kahuna split a Zero bar for dessert.  I’m full, fat and happy.  I’ll be lulled to sleep tonight by the sound of rushing water.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596745,"Woke up to the sound of Harpers Creek. Ahhhh its like a breath of fresh air, but the sun wasn’t up yet so I closed my eyes again, but I thought I saw a light.  I had to be dreaming I thought but I opened my eyes up wide just in case. Sure enough a light was flashing above me.  A lightning bug had flown up under my rain fly and was giving me a little light show.  
I did get up about 6:30.  Not sure what time we headed out of camp, but I was the first one out again.  I knew I had a big climb right out of the gate this morning, and I just wanted to get moving.  I must have also been the first one on the trail at all this morning. It was me spitting and sputtering with every flying web I ate!  
 Very early my UP became a very difficult up.  There were a lot of rock scrambles. Some of them required hand over hand climbing. When I wasn’t pulling myself up over boulders, I was gingerly stepping on jagged rocks.  My feet are REALLY mad at me right now! 
So that’s how it went all the way up to Three Ridges at 3965 ft elevation.  We had already started the climb up last night before we pitched our tents. That made my UP only about 2300ft. The roughest 2300 ft I’ve done UP to date! And the cherry on top was the weeds that were taller than me and grown in on both sides sides of trail. I’m apparently allergic to them.  My arms and legs were itching all day long.  
When I finally reached the summit I was gifted with a prancing doe!  She was beautiful and big! 
I wish I could say that was the only UP...nope.  It was just the biggest up.  My glutes were on fire again today!  Hugs says this is a good thing.  I’m not so sure!  I just kept trying to focus on my breathing.  
After only 8.1 miles we came out on a road at Reeds Gap and hitched a ride to Devils Backbone micro brewery.  Word on the trail is that they cater to thru-hikers.  We had planned to eat lunch and head back out but quickly decided to stay the night.  They offer free tenting with a state of the art bath house, and free breakfast.  SOLD!  
We’ve all showered, ate, and drank.  We’ll be good to go tomorrow!

",Reeds Gap,"Jul 09, Mon",8.10
Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596880,"Woke up at Devils Backbone Campground.  This place is really nice.  Last night I ran into Everywhere.  She’s hiking with Cyborg now.  I thought they would be way ahead of us, but Cyborg was sick for a bit so they spent some time at the beach in Maryland while he recuperated. You never know who you might see again. 
We headed over to the lodge for our hiker breakfast.  I had scrambled eggs  with spinach tossed in them, potatoes with sliced sausages, a ciabatta roll, and smoked bacon that was so thick and yummy it tasted like a porkchop!  Oh and coffee!  
After breakfast Hugs went to buy a Devil’s Backbone t-shirt and I went outside to check my phone.  I had plugged it into an outside socket.   Only 46%.  It is difficult keeping a charge in these mountains.   Airplane mode only for me today.  
Before long our shuttle driver was ready.  Six of us piled into his truck some in the cab and some in the bed with our packs. We began making our way back to the trail.  One quick stop at the convenient store for some sodas and we were soon walking north.  
I took the lead early on.  The terrain was a little rocky but not horribly so...yet.  Birdies were chirping and over all it was a great morning. 
I heard some ruckus to my left and there was a bear. He turned and made a mad dash downhill.  They really are clumsy going downhill!  It sounded like a freight train had gone off track crashing through the forest.  You’ve heard the expression “all you could see were tennis shoes and elbows”? Well when a bear runs downhill all I could see was ears- butt-ears-butt-ears-butt.  I had to giggle a little! 
So those itchy weeds are everywhere right now.  I should have known, but I re-learned that they are Nettles. It doesn’t take much for those things to make a hiker miserable. 
Just as my itching was beginning to subside I caught up to a couple of hikers. They are That’s Right and Bucket.  That’s Right is from Mississippi and he’s somewhat of a history buff.  I’ve never really spent any time in Mississippi but I would really like to do that some time.  
Those hikers were also smokers. I decided to take a break so I didn’t have to breathe their second hand smoke.  Hugs and Big Kahuna arrived so my tramily hiked on together. We came to a nice overlook with a view of Wintergreen township. Big Kahuna took a photo of me there.  It was meant to be my feature photo for today, but that changed. 
Just around a small bend in the trail sat a local couple. They were enjoying the view, a snack, and each other’s company.  The woman began offering us crackers and cheese.  We assured her that we were very well fed this morning, but gave her our empty soda bottles to pack out for us. She felt better doing something nice for us , and we were happy to lose our empty soda bottles. 
I took off first again.  I just love the serenity being alone in the mountains. I know the others are just minutes behind me, but it feels alone.  I came upon some unique rock wall formations. The trail had become very rocky. Every step had to be taken cautiously, so I couldn’t hike and look.  I had to stop and look. But I forged ahead listening to the birds chatter, and smelling the forest for 2 more hours alone.  
Then I reached some cliffs with a view and it was lunchtime.  That’s Right, Bucket, and a new guy from Massachusetts named Rub-N-Tug were already there.  Rub-N-Tug gave me his rock and I waited for Big Kahuna and Hugs to eat my lunch. We rested our very sore feet while eating and enjoying the view of a ski resort below. 
The three of us left lunch together. Bucket had said there was water 2.6 miles ahead, and knew that I needed it.  On the way there Hugs asked me if I had heard about breakfast.  No, what?  Turns out breakfast was actually $5 a person.   I had just walked out without paying!   I have a great trail sister though and she took care of mine with her t-shirt.  So much for the free breakfast idea!  
When we got there, the water source was down to a small trickle.  I was able to fill one of my bottles only. It would be enough to get me to the shelter. I think there was 4 more miles to go.  It felt like it was 54 miles with my extremely painful feet!  I was convinced I had a stress fracture in both feet! 
We stayed pretty close together from the water source on. I was in the front and heard a little scuttle on the ground to my left. I always look even at the littlest sound because there are venomous snakes everywhere.  But this little scuttle turned out to be a tiny little mountain mouse.  He was trying to hide under some leaves.  His little head was sticking out and I got the cutest pic. We named him Harry. Harry would now be the photo of the day. Hugs said if we stick around long enough we would probably see a snake come eat him”! Yikes!  Run Harry run!   
We continued on over many rock scrambles. Hugs and I were both complaining about our feet.  I just started walking as fast as I could to get to the shelter and get off of them.  For no reason at all I looked to my right. There she was just looking up at me, a bear!  I finally got a photo!  It’s not a good photo, but I got one. Hugs was right behind me and she saw a cub hiding behind a log. Big Kahuna   made it in time to see it too.  She wasn’t threatened by our presence at all.  It was one of those magical moments that occur on the A.T. 
We stayed on high bear alert the rest of the way.  It was a good thing we did because we managed to squeeze in one more mama and baby!  
We arrived at the shelter at 7pm. There were 3 section hikers already claiming space, but there was room for us too. For the first time we saw bear poles.  They make hanging your bear bag so much easier!  Just put your bag on a hooked pole and raise it up to a hook on a much taller stationary pole. Boom! Just like that!  
A grazing doe meandered by as we were rushing to cook our dinners before dark. 
Painful feet were worth it!   I’ll remember this day forever!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596924,"We all had nearly zero minutes of sleep last night.  It was a long night. My feet were literally throbbing. Before the sun came up Hugs said let’s just pack up and go.  Big Kahuna thought we should wait until first light, so we did.  
By 7am we were out of camp and on our way to Rockfish Gap. Nobody really felt good mostly from lack of sleep. 
I took the lead early on, though we stayed close together.  To my right was a sign for Lowe Family Cemetery. At first I walked right past it until Hugs pointed out the sign. The headstones were literally mountain rock.  There was one modern-ish grave marker from 2016. It was really just a tiny little sign, but could clearly be read. The other stones have all faded and worn down so much they’re impossible to read. 
About a mile past the cemetery was a little area called the home place.  It was another one of those free standing fireplaces with a rock ring around it.  I’ve seen 4 or 5 of those now.  I need to research why they are there. 
No unusual wildlife today except maybe the tiniest toad I’ve ever seen.  I had my usual chirps and tweets on the radio. It remains my favorite station.  The squirrels are usually active at sun-up and today was no exception.  Mountain squirrels are definitely the fattest squirrels I’ve ever seen.  That’s saying something coming from Illinois.  
We called Trail Angel Ann who picked us up, and now we are at Stanimals Hostel in Waynesboro.  The last Stanimals was good, but this one is even better!  
My stay here at Stanimals was a birthday gift to me from Big Kahuna.  He got a private room with its own bathroom.  That’s a big deal at a hostel!  Best yet it has one of those deep old fashioned bathtubs.  Hugs gave me a new loofa, a bath bomb, and a pumice for my feet.  I had the most luxurious bath ever!  
We took a shuttle to an all you can eat Chinese Buffet.  I’ve been wanting sushi and it was delicious!   I left there fat and happy! 
After eating we decided to run to Walmart for a re-supply.  I didn’t need much. Papa Big Swig’s package had already arrived here at Stanimals leaving me with very little to get. 
 First I needed a new eating utensil.  My brand new one broke last night. The plastic ones are just too cheaply made. I decided that I was getting a metal one but no such luck.  They only had plastic. Here We’ll see how long I keep this one. 
Secondly I needed new water bottles.  Hikers use Smart Water bottles.  They are the most light weight, come in liter sizes with a sip spout.  I went to the water aisle and couldn’t believe there were no Smart Waters.  In a hiking town!?!  Ok so I grabbed a Coke Zero a banana and some chips.  I checked out and went to the shuttle.  Hugs came out shortly behind me and I complained about the lack of Smart Water.  She said she bought some.  It’s located near the alcohol.  What!?!  I ran back in real quick. Past the aisle labeled water to the alcohol section.  Yep, there it was.  Whoever thought of that shelving plan needs a stern talking to!  In Paducah Kentucky, Walmart keeps crackers by the fish.  Real live gills moving, swimming in a tank fish!  There’s another employee who needs a talking to!  Oh well, I have new water bottles now. Grabbed some corn chips and bean dip. Checked out again.  
I very much dislike Walmart!  
In honor of my birthday tomorrow, and to rest our bodies we will be a taking a zero.

I woke up about 6am even though it’s a zero day.  I had a banana, a snowball, and coffee for breakfast.   Chillin’ on the front porch of Stanimals Hostel here in Waynesboro, Virginia.   
Begonia,  a work for stay hiker is leaving today to go back home to New York.  Her father is here to pick her up. I’ve really grown to like her and will miss seeing her.  She’s a hula-hoop fanatic and now my interest is sparked! Maybe I’ll start teaching a hula-hoop exercise class!?!  What fun that would be! 
I spent about an hour organizing my pack, and still haven’t gone through all of my food.  I’m going to be super tired tomorrow but will have to do it then. 
Big Kahuna was gone all morning.  He returned with flowers and a birthday card for me. He’s such a great trail brother!  
The three of us had a steak & buffet for lunch.  My steak was cooked perfectly!  After lunch we walked around to find a nail shop without any luck. Stanimal gifted me a free shuttle for my birthday, so Hugs and I used it to go across town. No more ingrown toenail for me!  Wish I could say my feet feel great, they don’t, but they definitely feel better.  
Just when I thought there could be no more I was called downstairs to be surprised with a birthday cake!  AND everybody sang happy birthday to me. They also participated in my family fun and wore a stick-on mustache for a photo.  I sent it to the kids, they loved it!

Hugs and I chose to zero so we could spend this day with him. It’s impossible to express how much I will miss him.  He’s  a great trail brother!  
I took advantage of the time to finish going through my food supply. Hugs and I will be going into the Shenandoah National Park tomorrow for a flip flop. We’ll spend one more night here at Stanimals. Sunday morning will start our full pack northbound through the rest of the Shenandoahs.  I’m taking very little food with me.  The word  on trail is that there’s a town restaurant available every day through the park.  If that’s wrong, I’ll be in trouble.  
We decided to enjoy a steak and salad bar again today. Hugs and I both needed to shower for that.  She usually goes first because her hair requires a lot of time.  So first she was while I continued with Hike preparations.  
When she came out of the shower she was wrapped up in towels and laughing at herself.  Hugs had managed to fall completely out of the shower!  Butt on the floor feet up over the tub, and water everywhere!   It was slippery from all the cream rinse she uses on her hair. We laughed a good bit as I envisioned the whole thing.   It was funny for about an hour when she started to stiffen up from the fall. 
The repeat steak dinner was good. Not as good as yesterday’s, but good.  Food takes on a whole new meaning when I’ve got hiker hunger going on.  Today I did not.  
One last Walmart run, a game of cards.  Hugs is current champ.  It will stay that way until Big Kahuna gets back.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597222,"We were up early to catch our shuttle into the Shenandoah National Park. Hugs and I plan to be dropped off 20 miles into the park then hike southbound back to Rockfish Gap.  But first things first...it was time to say goodbye to Big Kahuna.  A quick hug and best wishes were given before we had to get in the shuttle.  No time for tears today, but we’ve all shed plenty over his sudden departure. If he can, he’ll be back in a few weeks.  
So there we were,  just me and Hugs starting our day.  It was really strange at first without Big Kahuna, but soon we got our groove and started UP.  I’ve been really good on the UPs lately.  So I just knocked it out.  Hugs wasn’t far behind. 
A small group of deer crossed the path in front of me and headed down to my left. I very clearly saw two of them.  Still no Bucks!  Does anybody know why I’ve never seen a Buck?  
I stopped for a potty break so Hugs took the lead for a while.  She had her eyes wide open today.   She spied a moth. The most unique moth I’ve ever seen!  It looks exactly like a leaf, but it’s definitely a moth with a body, legs, and wings that look like a leaf.  
The trail crossed through or by many parking lots today.  I’m sure that’s because we are hiking through a national park.  So the first parking lot we came to past the moth was our lunch break location. We had already covered almost 8 miles by then.  Wow! We were flying! 
From the parking lot we crossed a road before heading back up into the mountains.  From the road there was a breathtaking view of the Shenandoah Mountains!  We both walked over to take it all in for a minute.  
Once we finally crossed the road and started UP, we got a little concerned about water.  Water has been scarce for a while.  I guess that’s summertime on the trail.  There was a shelter about 4 miles up with a piped spring near it. 
So we started our biggest climb with 4 miles to go just to get to water! This is Calf Mountain at 2895ft elevation.  Today was our lucky day!  About three miles up we happened upon Pelican & Clifty.  They were collecting water at a surprise spring. This made our day!  We talked a good 10 minutes as we collected and filtered our water.  We said our goodbyes and Pelican & Clifty continued northbound.  We continued South.  
We passed several Crab Apple trees after we had gotten water.  That’s the first time I’ve seen them on the trail.  There were also raspberries today.  I tried one that looked ripe, but it was super tart.   No more berries for me today.  
It was getting close to the end of the day and I started picking up my pace. I met a NOBO who was on the phone somewhat in a panic over a standoff she had just experienced with a rattler.  She warned us of its location, but we never saw a thing.  
The final 3.7 miles of the trail became rocky.   My feet and hips started talking to me.  I came to an area near a cell tower where 4 or 5 tractor seats had been placed into the ground.  I could actually sit in them. Hugs said it looks like that area was a playground at some time. She sat in one too.   
Hugs took the lead from there.  I followed her right on out to a road.  We walked down it a little ways and could see a gourmet popcorn stand. That would be the ending to our 20 mile hike.  They had Chicago Mix and I was so excited to get it, but it wasn’t Garrett’s, and I was so disappointed.  I ate a hot dog and waited for the shuttle. 
Tomorrow morning I will leave Stanimals.  Hugs and I will have our full packs walking northbound together.  We can do this!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597318,"We said goodbye to our friends at Stanimals this morning.  Crash dropped us off at Blackrock Gap and we started walking north with our full packs on.  We passed a couple of great views early on.  One of them is today’s photo. 
The terrain was decent, and very quickly we were 3 miles. There was a a picnic area! It was time for an early lunch.  
The cool thing about hiking in a National Park is that it’s set up for public use. This is a nice little treat for us hikers.  We get picnic tables, port-a-potties, and even campground facilities.  
After lunch the terrain really stayed pretty nice. There were two good UPs, but few rocks and few roots.  I came upon a snake who was enjoying the sun right in the middle of the trail.  I’ve seen some snakes like this before. He was a dark thin snake with neon yellow stripes down each side.  I waited there for Hugs to see him, but he slithered off before she got there.  
I began hearing thunder in the distance. The clouds were coming in.  I always like that, because it cools things off. Before the rain hit we arrived at a campground grocery store. It had a nice covered breezeway with benches and a place to charge our phones. On one side was bathrooms and the other side was the store and laundry.  We both plugged in our phones and kicked back on a bench for about 20 minutes. My feet needed the break! The rains came but it wasn’t much more than sprinkles.  
Briefly, I want to mention Harry. He’s the mouse I saw a few days ago.  I thought he was an unusual looking mouse. That’s because he’s not a mouse at all!  One of my readers informed me that Harry is a Shrew.  I don’t know much about a Shrew, but they are venomous and they actually eat mice! 
After leaving the store I heard thunder and saw lightning the rest of the way to the hut.  In the park they are called Huts not Shelters... they look the same to me.  
The rain remained sprinkles the whole way.  At one point we passed through a parking lot.  Some people were there taking photographs.  Suddenly a woman jumped and yelled SNAKE!  We looked, and sure enough there was a big ole rattler.  
Back into the woods we went.  Our elevation must have been fairly high because it became a pine forest.  The scent was just lovely, and fallen pine needles make for a nice soft path.  
When we arrived there were two people here. A guy named Dozer who is through hiking, and a lady named Forest Diva. She’s an opera singer.  We got a sample of her vocals. wow!  Amazing!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597382,"It was a rough night of sleep.  Myself and Forest Diva were wide awake listening to mice scratch and scurry about the Hut.  We both shined our lights in hopes of making it stop. It didn’t work. 
Hugs and I both found mouse poop in our packs this morning, but thankfully no mouse!  Dozer tented last night, but somehow a mouse climbed the bear pole and chewed a hole through his bear bag to dine on tortillas.  It actually made 2 holes because it chewed through where the sack was cinched.  I offered him some of my food, but he declined.  
There was a Doe grazing around our Hut this morning.  I tried to feed her an apricot but she wasn’t having that.  She trotted off briefly but returned grazing very close to us. She is today’s photo.  
I reached the 900 mile mark today!  Yay!! Hugs and I had a celebratory moment before moving on. We can’t sit still too long. 
 There are little black biting flies this time of year and they make it impossible to stand still for any length of time. If you can picture the cloud of dust around Pig Pen from the Charlie Brown cartoon?  That’s  how these flies are! A black cloud of biting flies swarming around me as I walk. 
About 4 miles in we decided to stop at some cliffs with a view for a snack.  Hugs pulled out her brand new IPhone 10 to take a photo.  It’s so humid here!  Her hands were sweaty and the phone slipped right out onto a ledge.  It slid off that ledge and down again...and one more time.  We used a rope and she went down,  but no luck retrieving it. 
We had to hike on. Within a half mile we came out onto a road at Powell Gap. We decided to hitch a ride to the closest campground so Hugs could have cell service. Then she could use my phone to get hers replaced.  
That’s where our Trail Angel Judy Renner stepped in.  What a lovely lady!  She’s here on vacation from Columbus Ohio, and had dropped her hubby off to play golf. Im not sure why, but she decided to help us girls out when she saw us hitchhiking. She drove us only 8 miles or so to the campground but it took a good thirty minutes.  No complaints. Then she helped us get a camp site before she left.  What a blessing she was!  Thank you Judy!  
Hugs called for a replacement phone, but it doesn’t sound promising.  She felt confident she could get it replaced because she had purchased great insurance, but now they are saying they don’t cover lost or stolen phones. Technically hers isn’t lost it’s just unreachable.  We do know exactly where it’s located.  
So for tonight we’re tenting at Lewis Mountain Campground.  In the morning we plan to hitch a ride back to Powell Gap and try one more time to reach her phone... wish us luck.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597486,"Last night was a “WILD” night with very little sleep.  A screech owl screeched all night long.   At one point it was near Hugs tent and she had to scare it away.  Other critters were scampering around, and making noises too.  I thought I was sleeping in a jungle instead of a campground.  
We decided last night that we were definitely going back for Hugs’ cell phone today.  We hitchhiked a couple of miles before Crash the caretaker at Stanimals picked us up.  After coming back to the campground, for a guest, he drove us 8 miles to where we left off yesterday. Powell Gap.  
Hugs offered him $100 to help us retrieve the phone.  He had to take his passenger to Waynesboro and drive back, but he said he would.  
In the meantime Hugs and I used rope to try and go down over the cliff. That didn’t work. Then we walked down around the mountain and began bushwhacking our way up.  We made it quite a good distance up, but couldn’t go any farther.  We went up and down that mountain a few times.  In the end we just had to wait for Crash. 
About an hour later Crash arrived with gear in hand.  He also tried from the top.  Too steep!  So I took him up from the bottom as far as we had already gone, then he took off on his own. Like a pro he made his way to the bottom of the cliffs above.  My phone had service today and Hugs was able to use FIND MY IPHONE from it. Her phone started pinging and Crash saved the day! 
It was about 2pm by now. Even though we walked a few miles there, and went up and down that same mountain 5 times, we had zero trail miles.  It’s 14 trail miles back to the campground, but at 2pm thunder was overhead, and raindrops were falling. Crash took us back to our tents. Another unplanned zero has taken place.  
We were back only a few minutes when Forest Diva came walking across the lot to the lodge! We thought we would never see her again. She had rented a cabin. Dozer came hiking up too!  It was a reunion!  Before long Bo Diesel joined us.   We met him today. 
Forest Diva let those of us who wanted use the shower in her cabin. I chose to use it.  Hugs paid for her shower at the lodge.  We threw all of our laundry in together for one load, and planned our dinners. 
Before long we all had dehydrated meals, marshmallows and roasting sticks, and some adult beverages.  It was a party at Forest Diva’s place!  She has a cute little pavilion with lights at her cabin.  The fire pit is right there too. What a good time!  
I stayed until 8:30pm...that’s past hikers midnight.  Wish I could have stayed longer.  
Food is now in the bear boxes, and I’m ready for bed, but these owls have other plans.  Praying for sleep tonight.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597597,"I slept like a baby last night. The owls were quiet, and so was everything else. I crawled out of my tent around 6:45 this morning and headed to the women’s restroom.  I can’t believe it!  A real restroom with real toilets that flush!  The joys of hiking through a National Park!  
When I came out of the bathroom there was another unusual looking moth.  This one looked like a fallen brown leaf.  I learned the other moth is called a Luna Moth.(thanks to a reader). I will look this one up when I can too.  
Hugs and I went to the lodge to say our goodbyes.  Forest Diva, Dozer, Bo Diesel, and Nigel the store manager was there.  They’re all a great group of people!  A few hugs and a few fist bumps later we were on our way. 
Forest Diva, Hugs, and I made our way to the trail. Forest Diva went North and we went south to make up the 14 miles we missed yesterday.  
We were slack packing.  Nigel let us keep our big packs in the lodge while we hiked today.  The terrain was excellent!  We had one rock scramble and it really wasn’t that bad.  
It was unusually cool this morning, so our water consumption was less than it has been.  That’s a good thing, because water sources close to or on the trail are getting scarce.  Just as I mentioned that to Hugs we walked right past a creek...go figure!   
There were plenty of raspberries on trail today.  No hiker should go hungry this time of year.  No bears should go hungry either. 
Speaking of bears, I saw another one today. He was a big guy!  My poles clanking around scared him, so he took off running.  Hugs didn’t get to see him. 
Hugs had the lead part of the day.  There were branches and sticks on our path. She accidentally scooted one around in the trail. She turned to make sure I was ok. I told her I was ok. Then I took a step.  She turned to find me on the ground!  2 seconds is literally all it took. 
14.5 miles down the path, and we popped out on the road at Powell Gap.  This is our third time to see Powell Gap. First was the day Hugs dropped her phone. Second was the day we went back to try to retrieve her phone, and third was today.  Now I’m quite partial to Powell, but I hope I never see Powell Gap again!  
It was 8 highway miles back to Lewis Campground where our packs were located.  We started walking and hitchhiking.  Two beautiful yellow canaries were playing and flying around near us.  Hugs pulled out her phone, but it was too late. They flew off.  I think bird pictures are the hardest to get. 
Only a minute or two went by before a couple from Georgia stopped the truck and gave us a ride. Lee and Leanne.  Very nice folks!   They took us 3 or 4 miles up until it was time for them to turn off.   We stopped at every overlook on the way and chatted a little.  He’s retired, and she’s a school teacher.  The back of that truck was pretty warm because it had s topper on it.  There was a cooler back there but the sign on it said “caution Snakes”.  I wasn’t about to look!  Lee knew we were hot and thirsty so he handed us both a cold PBR...I guzzled mine down.  We said goodbye to our Trail Angels at their exit and started walking again.  
It was only a minute or two before Yoan stopped.  He’s a Bulgarian who’s currently living in Richmond.  He’s a painter & was on his way up for a day trip.  He took us to pick up our packs at Lewis Campground then drove us up to Big Meadows Wayside. We had great conversation along the way about mountain ranges in Bulgaria, and hiking the A.T. It was a quick ride, we thanked our final Trail Angel and headed into the Big Meadows Wayside to see what it was all about.  
We knew Forest Diva would be meeting us for dinner tonight so we were just going to get a snack. Well, 8 pieces of fried chicken and an order of onion rings later we were afraid dinner was ruined.  I tried one of the blackberry milkshakes everybody raves about. It wasn’t at all what I had hoped for.  I didn’t drink much of it.  
From the Wayside it was nearly a mile walk with our full packs on. I had already taken off my boots, so I was full packing in Crocs.  A bicycle came up from behind and yelled “LEFT”.  Hugs immediately turned around and said “yes”!  She thought he was offering a lift!  We laughed a little about that!  
Registering for our campsite went smoothly as a deer grazed across the street.  They have no fear in the park.  I liked our last campground better, but this will do.  It’s packed full of tents and there’s a hot water problem.   
Forest Diva arrived later. She had hiked to this campground earlier, but shuttled all the way back to Waynesboro to pick up her vehicle.  She stopped at Lewis Campground to see if we were there. Nigel let her know we were already gone. He sent autographed bags with her for us. They will be great for the shower room!  So Forest Diva is now tenting beside us for two nights.  Then she has to go back home and do the mom thing she loves so much.  
The three of us went to the lodge. We all saw a stunning sunset.  It brought tears to Forest Diva’s eyes.  We had another much smaller dinner and listened to a guitar soloist sing and play. Forest Diva and I danced a couple of times.  It was another fun night!   
Just as things were wrapping up, in walked Nigel!  He’s off duty now and this place was his former job before he moved to Lewis Mountain.  We visited a couple of minutes and took some photos.  It’s pretty awesome how 2 days at a campground can result in such good friendships.  
It’s now way way past hikers midnight!  It’s past everybody’s midnight!  Sleep well

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597690,"I woke up and took the 1/8 mile trek to the campground facilities.  After 20 minutes or so I was dressed and ready to go.  When I put my hiker fanny pack back on, I noticed the ziploc with my cash, credit cards, and I.D. was missing.  This put me into a full on panic mode! 
Immediately I went to the guard shack/office and asked if anybody had turned it in.  I knew I had it at the lodge last night so I asked them to call the lodge too. No luck.  
I let them know that I am a thru-hiker and a gentleman asked if I was Blue Moon? I said “close, I am Blue Raccoon”. He had gotten a call from Texas about me.  Not Texas my Trail Brother, but from the state of Texas.  I had to clarify that.  It turns out he is one of the Roundabouts, and his wife Mrs Roundabout is reading my journal! She had let him know that I was coming.  I have no idea who is reading this thing, but it makes me happy to know at least some people are enjoying my journey.   
Mr Roundabout assured me I would probably find my ziploc amongst my things...I did.  
Hugs and I were so grateful to get a ride from Forest Diva back to Lewis Campground this morning.  We slack packed back to Big Meadows Campground.  Where our tents would already be set up. We had planned to do more miles today, but her and I both just weren’t feeling well.  We think it was the chicken. 
Today’s path was EXCELLENT!  This definitely was the easiest day ever as far as terrain goes.  The only thing missing was Big Kahuna.  I hope he gets back soon. 
Today was a day for sauntering. I did just that. At one point I looked up to find a bear about 100 ft to my left.  He was watching me curiously, and I looked at him the same.  When I reached for my phone he turned his back and moseyed away from me.  Another A.T. magical moment.  
Hugs reappeared behind me right after the bear.  I actually thought she was in front of me. That’s a long story.  But we stayed together the rest of the day.  
The path was just amazing!  Which was much appreciated since neither of us were at our best today.  We walked up on a big brood of turkeys!  I had been seeing turkey feathers for a while, then there they were.  They went waddling off into the woods.  You never know what a turkey might do.  They can act crazy sometimes!  
The last 1.5 miles was a bit Up.  We passed a cemetery and one last overlook before we found ourselves back at the campground.  It really was a great trail today.  I hate we had to cut it short. 
After a quick shower and load of laundry the three of us(myself,Hugs, Forest Diva) headed to the lodge for dinner.  I had Ribs with mashed potatoes and coleslaw.  Blackberry lemonade to drink. Yummy!   
We all charged our phones and enjoyed some great sisterhood conversations. Before we hiked up to black rock to watch God’s handy work.  The sunset was a true work of art tonight.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597809,"The three of us girls had breakfast at our campsite picnic table this morning. Hugs and I wondered if the big breakfast yesterday had added to our lethargy.  So this morning it was coffee and a tortilla with Nutella for me.  
During breakfast I found a microscopic tick had embedded itself right where my ear and face meet.  When I removed it, there was bleeding, and now a hole.  This of course has me worried given the high incidents of Lyme Disease in this area. Say a prayer for me.  
We loaded up in Forest Diva’s Jeep and drove north.  The drive was much longer than our hike would be.  It’s that whole driving around mountains thing.  We did see another large brood of turkeys during our drive.  This mama had 6 or 7 tiny babies.  They were so cute. 
Hugs and I began our slack pack SOBO flip flop from Panorama Parking Area. There were bathrooms at the parking lot, so we took advantage of them before we headed out.  It was in there when I realized my Advil was not located where I thought I had put it.  ( I misplace things on a regular basis). By the time I hit the trailhead I KNEW  my Advil was definitely lost.  This is not good with a 17 mile day planned.  
An elderly gentleman saw my distress and said he at least had aspirin if I would like some.  YES please and thank you!  In the end he gave me two Alieve.  Losing my Advil is what I call a “happy accident”. I’ve learned that Alieve gives me much better relief than Advil ever did.  He was my Trail Angel today.  
This morning started out UP. The terrain changed back and forth, but there were lots more rocks than I was hoping for.  I said to Hugs, “is this Pennsylvania?”  My feet were seriously giving me grief by the end of the day.  
At one point the terrain just smoothed out and opened up into a grassy area, almost like a little bald. But it wasn’t. That was nice! Eventually that bald of sorts turned into a picnic site.  Just as we were getting close to the picnic tables we saw a mama dear with a fawn.  This was my first fawn of the hike.  It had little white spots like Bambi and everything.  I can’t wait to be in a place with WiFi long enough to upload all of my photos.  
Anyway, wildlife ALWAYS makes my heart happy!  And even though the rocks were a real pain, it was cooler than usual for a July day with nice breezes. There were views galore too. I couldn’t ask for anything more.  
So hiking through a National Park can really spoil a thru-hiker. About 9 miles into our day was a blue blaze to Skyland Resort.  This was perfect for a late lunch.  I had a burger and a side salad with Diet Pepsi. I charged my phone and looked around in the gift shop. Then I rested my weary body on the sofa.  I think we spent a good hour there.  
It was getting a little late into the afternoon when we finally left the resort. We had 8 more miles still to go before we would be back at camp. I started out in the lead, and took off quickly to make up miles for time lost. Soon we were slowed way down.  Bears everywhere!  
When dusk hits the mountains the bears get busy.  Hugs calls it “Bear-thirty”!   I like that phrase!  So there it was a bear to our right. I heard it first then we saw him plain as day.  We had a nice photo session.  I just can’t get enough of them!  Before we reached camp there was a total of three bears. Every single one was a magical A.T. moment for me.  I was able to photo or video each bear. 
The last mile of our hike was UP...again.  This is proof that it is possible to walk uphill both ways. We walked uphill leaving, and uphill coming back.  At least it wasn’t winter time, and we both had shoes!  
Hugs and I walked straight to the lodge where we met up with our new friend and Trail Sister Forest Diva.  We had dessert and champagne to honor this new friendship. I’m certain we will be lifelong friends! Forest Diva has stayed an extra day with us but she really has to leave tomorrow.  I will miss her very much.  
On that note, it’s way past hikers midnight again.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597842,"Forest Diva packed her tent up this morning.  She waited for Hugs and I to shower then drove us to our starting place.  We stopped at a Wayside for coffee and some girl time before we had to say goodbye.  This will be the last time we see Forest Diva for a while.   I’m hoping we can meet up again when we get to New York.  If not, I plan to fly to Mexico in November to watch her perform.  She has quite a list of adjectives by her name, but world renowned opera singer is one of them!  More than that she’s a wonderful human being who I am so blessed to call my friend!  
The drive to our starting point was a foggy one.  Our morning views were just a grey abyss.  It was also beyond chilly this morning. I have actually been cold all day.  
Hikers usually just carry clothing they need for the current season.  It’s July, so at this moment I have no pants, and only one long sleeved shirt that I sleep in.  Dilemma!  I don’t want to hike in my only long sleeved shirt and get it all sweaty.  Then what do I sleep in?  I simply had to hike in it today. No choice. Sadly I will sleep in it tonight too.  I’ll probably have to hike in it again tomorrow as well. Hopefully I’ll be warm in my tent tonight.  
Hugs and I have noticed lately that we don’t see turtles anymore.  They used to be on the trail every day.  We’re pretty certain most of them are in Maine already! Haha!!  I guess sloths are slower than turtles! 
Since we were both cold we hiked at speedy sloth pace.  I began having issues with one of my contact lenses so I stopped to manage the problem.  Hugs hiked on.  
Today is the blackberry festival at the Shenandoah National Park so it’s even more busy than usual.  In my rush to catch back up with Hugs I met a family of 6 hiking the other way.  I love seeing that!  Hiking is a great family activity.  
Anyway, about 1/4 mile later I caught up to Hugs. She and I hiked a little ways together when she said “where’s your poles”?  Oh no!!! The terrain was so nice that I didn’t miss my poles at all. I had to run all the way back, and pray that family didn’t pick them up.   
The man up front did pick them up, but he turned around to bring them to me.  Somehow he knew they must’ve been mine. I was so grateful!   The world is full of good people, but hikers are especially good!   
We hiked on in silence for quite a while.  I just tuned in to my favorite radio station.  It was cold, but the birdies were chirping. 
The next thing I know, Hugs was grabbing me in a place I’m sure she wasn’t aiming for, but right there was a big beautiful Buck!  They do exist!  I’m going to say he was a 6 point( guessing). I only got to see him walking away but I was excited! 
There was a Wayside just ahead so we stopped there for lunch.  It was outside seating only.  Ugh!  We had picked up a cold roast beef sandwich this morning.  We just ate our sandwiches quickly and got moving again before we turned into ice cubes. 
While we were eating a gentleman approached us asking about our hike and the trail. He said that he thru-hiked a few years back when he was 66 years old. I think he said he is 71 now.  His name is Bloodhound.  He wished us well and as he walked away we noticed he still has calves of steel.  A sure sign of a hiker.  
We hurried on our way again.  Thank goodness the terrain was excellent again today. Not much would slow us down, until we met a thru-hiker named Onion.  We were on a slack pack flip flop again today so we get to see all the NOBO’s still out there.  As soon as Onion realized we are thru-hikers too she said “I have magic” as she pulled out a tall Coors lite.  It’s funny, I’m not even a beer drinker but I popped the top and we three shared it until it was gone.  Soon, her hiking partner Gusto arrived and we said our goodbyes. I took her trash with me since I was coming back to camp.  
We only had a little over 2 miles left of our hike. The terrain stayed great the whole way. I looked up and there stood another Buck with a couple of does right on the trail.  He’s a young buck, but definitely antlers are there. 
A half hour later we arrived at the Panorama Parking Area.  Our hiking day was done.  Our tents are still pitched at Big Meadows Campground about a 30-40 minutes drive away.  Thumbs up and out!   
A couple of very nice gentleman picked us up, Richard and Chandler.  We had great conversation the entire way back to the lodge. We took some photos with them and thanked our final Trail Angels of the day!  
Tomorrow we will pack up our tents and hike right on out of the park. It’s been fun slack packing all around our campsite, but I’m ready for a real bed and resupply.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598117,"Last night it got really cold!  Not only that, it also rained all night long.  Hugs and I stayed at the lodge as late as possible before making a dash for our tents. 
A family was sitting beside us.  The dad used to hike and he knew I had no warm clothing, so he went to their camp and brought me an old pair of his sweatpants.  What an awesome Trail Angel!    
I woke up well rested. Hugs woke up in a pool of water. It came up from the ground into the bottom of her tent.  We both packed up heavy wet gear and walked a mile to the Wayside for breakfast.  Our full packs feel fuller with wet things inside.  
After breakfast we started hitchhiking our way north to our starting point.  It was 20+ miles or so. The fog was thick. Cars couldn’t see us until it was too late to stop.  We did watch a mama deer and fawn come across the road and hop over some weeds into a field of grass.  That fawn was so cute mimicking it’s mama! 
We walked back to the Wayside to see if we could just get a ride, but no luck.  There was a family there with a big van, but I didn’t approach them.  The young son, probably 8 or 9 years old, was throwing a royal sized fit about hiking!  Causing a huge scene screaming at his parents that he’s NOT hiking, he hates hiking blah blah blah.  I didn’t see it, but Hugs saw the dad finally manage the situation.  
We walked back to the road...thumbs up. 
The fog briefly lifted and a car stopped for us.  It was too small, and too full to hold us and our big packs. They apologized and moved on.  Then here comes the van...THE van.  It stopped.  The kid still had tears running down his cheeks, but was polite. They took us about a fourth of the way to where we needed to go. 
We weren’t without a ride long before Cindy(Pez) and Susan stopped.  Pez is a hiker, if you couldn’t guess. She works at REI in Jersey. We had great conversations with both of them. They dropped us off with not many miles left to go, and some plastic for Hugs to put under her tent.  
Up next was Hank & Ben.  They are father and son.  Ben told stories of how he used to be like the little boy in the van, but now he’s the one calling his dad to go hiking. 
Hank and Ben dropped us off at our starting point.  We were excited because today we will arrive in Front Royal Virginia. 
After 5 nights in my tent, my body is aching.  My left hip/low back has been out of place for well over a week. This comes from carrying a heavy pack and pounding out miles.  On a zero to 10 pain scale I would say I’m at a 7 most of the time.  
Thank goodness the terrain is pretty good here.  There were a few rock scrambles, but all things in moderation. Moderate or not, the rocks still shoot pain through my feet like nobody’s business!  There was one tree down that was so big we had to drop pack to get over it.  
Eventually we hiked along a fence line to the road that goes to Front Royal.  We hitchhiked the 3 miles into town. A very lovely lady picked us up and brought us to our hotel. 
We had so many Trail Angels today!  I cannot express enough how grateful I am for those who help us, complete strangers, expecting nothing in return.  
Papa Big Swig has gifted us a hotel stay.  We decided to stay another night too and slack pack the start of the roller coaster.  Getting ready for that ride.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598124,"Just getting out the door was a challenge. We had to get to the Post Office for our resupply boxes.  That took time. A nice elderly gentleman gave us a ride back to the hotel. We had 4 boxes total. Then, Hugs could not find her glasses. 
Our shuttle driver Sherry picked us up at the hotel to drive us 20 miles north. We planned to southbound back to our hotel in Front Royal.  Hugs had given up on her glasses and chose to Hike without them.  
Then it was a challenge just finding where we pick up the trail.  Sherry was very patient with us.  She’s a truck driver, and the safest driver we’ve been with so far.  I’m thankful for that because the last 10 minutes of our ride was in a torrential downpour!  
Yes we hopped on the trail in the pouring rain!  No rain, no pain, no Maine.  This is my mantra today.  
By now it was 11:15am. and we plan for a 20 mile day on the Roller Coaster. This area is called the Roller Coaster because the terrain is literally UP & DOWN like a coaster would be.  I could actually envision it as I walked. In my head I would say “clink-clink-clink-clink” on the UPs, then “WHOOSH” on the DOWNS.  
It’s funny that yesterday Hugs and I mentioned Dozer. We figured he may be in Harpers Ferry by now.  He will end his hike there this year.  Then out of nowhere here comes Dozer!   We are right on track to be there for his ending this year.  Harpers Ferry is the honorary halfway point.  
Right behind Dozer was Onion and Gusto.  Old home week! We’re the last of the few still hanging in there for the thru-hike.   There’s also a guy we call “No Name” because we can’t remember his name, and Everywhere, Cyborg, and Trail Walker. I’m sure there’s a few others, but right now that’s our bubble. 
The rain was pretty relentless for the first couple of hours.  Just like the old days our path became a creek st times.  I’ll be wearing wet boots tomorrow for sure.  
About 10 miles in there was a shelter.  We stopped for food and water. There was a nice piped spring.  In the rush this morning we both failed to grab our water bags.  I forgot my Sawyer Squeeze and Hugs’ Squeeze wasn’t working exactly right. I had to laugh!  How did we do this?!?  And we call ourselves hikers!?!  Together we made it work and both hiked out with water.  
The rain had stopped. Here comes the heavy after rain humidity. My glasses were fogging up so bad I couldn’t see a thing. It was better without them.  I hung them on my shirt collar so I could use them if I needed to look at Guthook’s.   
The trail opened up at one point to a couple of grassy areas. It was ice because the breeze could come through right there.  I saw a bunny shortly after the field.  She’s the only wildlife I had seen all day.  
Marching on in wet boots, I decided to see how many miles we had left.  We were pushing it to get off trail before dark. When I reached down to grab my glasses, they were gone.  What???  
I couldn’t believe it!  I hiked back a little distance but without my glasses I couldn’t see what I was looking for anyway. Unbelievable!  $300 pair of glasses...gone.  
I ran into a couple doing a day hike and asked if they would keep an eye out for them.  I gave them my number and Trail name.  As soon as I said Blue Raccoon the man told me he reads my journal.   I never got his name, but he’s spreading the word on the trail for me.  I saw Everywhere and Cyborg too.  Hopefully someone will see them.  
We saw one more bunny before hopping out onto the road.  A young man named Tyler picked us up. He’s 26 years old and had just gotten off work.  He’s an electrician working for the Union.  He took us to CVS where I could by some “cheater glasses”, then to our hotel.  He’s a very nice young man. He takes care of his parents who have serious health issues.  Keep Tyler in your prayers.  
We systematically went through our hotel room to find Hugs’ glasses.  NOPE! Can you believe it? We both lost our glasses on the same day.  Papa Big Swig is shipping my glasses from last year to me.  They’ll be better than nothing.  Hugs has to get a new pair made. It’s really hard hiking without your eyes, but tomorrow we’ll be doing just that.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598217,"I was up at 6:30 this morning. I laid around until 7:30 then grabbed our laundry.  The hotel laundry room is padlocked, so I had to get a key first.  One load of laundry washed and dried took almost two hours!  This allowed Hugs to sleep in a little. 
We had a late checkout planned because we’re only hiking 10 miles today and we wanted the luxury of a real bed and toilet as long as possible. We both had to run to the Post Office as well.  Long story short, our shuttle driver Sherry was there at 1pm sharp but Hugs still had things to do.  Sherry is great and she accommodated us.  Just as sweet as yesterday.  
Like yesterday too, just as we were getting out of the car, the rain came.  I was soaked within the first 5 minutes of my hike.  I remained soaked all day, and my hair is still soaked right now.  If the rain wasn’t getting me, sweat was.  
So yesterday we thought we did part of the roller coaster, but about a mile into our hike today there was an official sign marking the start of it.  I thought it was pretty much like yesterday until about 6 miles in. Very steep UPs and DOWNS.  It was far more difficult than yesterday!  
Eventually Hugs took the lead, and I just followed her blindly.  Mind you neither of us have glasses or contacts at the moment.  I did buy a pair of cheaters from CVS.  Anyway the trail crossed an area that was like the River Jordan.  I tried staying up on rocks, but I slipped down and cool water rushed in over the top of my boots. All of this rain has the creeks swelling over.  Then I followed her down a service road.  That should have been our clue!   You guessed it..wrong way!!  We lost a good half hour there.  
When we finally got back to the trail we both dropped our wet heavy packs and took a break.  My boots are heavy, my pack is heavy, and I am aching everywhere! 
I took the lead from there.  Somehow we ended up off trail again!  Ugh!  It’s hard to use our Guthook’s app in a be rain. We had not seen a soul for hours, but right then a trail volunteer with two doggies happened by. What a gift from God!   He pointed us I. The right direction.  We were less than 10 yards off trail, but couldn’t see it. 
The roller coaster is hard!   So much harder in the rain!  We saw a nice tent site, but wanted to make 1000 miles today so we kept going.  Then, WE DID IT!   There are no words!  I’ve walked 1000 miles!  
The sun was fading fast. I saw a couple of deer grazing.  Otherwise no other wildlife to be seen on this dreary day.  Or maybe neither of us could see them without our glasses.  
I stopped for water and my headlamp. It was clear these UPs were kicking my butt and I will be hiking into the night. Hugs headlamp wasn’t working properly, and my battery was fading fast.  We literally picked our way through serious rocks in the dark with a cellphone light.  We arrived at the shelter about 10pm.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598271,"Last night we woke up everybody while trying to get ourselves settled into the shelter. There was one man and one woman in there, and another woman tenting.  The man immediately said “well I’m outnumbered again”.  That was followed by “don’t you girls stay home and raise babies anymore?”, then a “we went wrong when we started letting you vote”.  Wow!!!! Really?   I was too tired to argue. 
I went to a covered area and took off my wet clothes in the dark. I tried to wash myself up with wet wipes, and made my way back to the shelter.  Once I had my bed set up and felt organized I tried to hang my bear bag.  
After several failed attempts I decided to just sleep with my food.   Mr Macho announced that he would help us “girls” out and hung both of our bags.  I’m sure he felt great about doing that.  I choked out a genuine thank you and Hugs gave him some candy.  
When I woke up this morning he was gone.  Us 4 princesses took our time. Moon Pie hit the trail about 8:30.  Sister Sticks and us left about 10:20 this morning.   I really enjoyed chatting with Sister Sticks. She’s 33 years old and just came out of the military.  Now she’s working towards becoming a Nun.  We talked a lot about becoming a Nun, life, and politics. She’s a very bright young lady!  
I told her about me and Hugs both losing our glasses.   She had stayed at a hostel the night before and said someone brought in glasses yesterday.  Papa Big Swig called for me, but no luck.  We’re both still blind.  
We had 7 or so miles of the roller coaster left to go today.  It is VERY rocky!  Hugs calls the rocks “speed bumps”.  They really are!  That’s what made us so late getting to the shelter last night.  
It rained a little this morning.  I didn’t care.  I had already put my feet back inside wet boots, and put back on my same dirty wet clothes.  
When the rain let up briefly, I did get to enjoy some sun. Hugs and I took a little break on a log.  It felt good to feel that warmth for a few minutes.  I also got one good Mountain View in during the sunshine’s time.  
The birds started chirping.  I realized I missed hearing them during these past couple days of rain.  
All too soon I was hearing thunder again.  The clouds rolled in and the rains came down.  We had 5 miles until the shelter or 3 miles to an ATC primitive bunkhouse.  We chose the bunkhouse.  There were exactly two bunks left.   
I cooked myself a Mountain House Turkey Casserole dinner.  I had a freeze dried ice cream sandwich for dessert, and a Sprite!  Yes they sell pop here!  
Going to bed fat and happy!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598437,"I woke up at the Blackburn Center this morning feeling well rested.  The rangers office had cold pop for sale, so an ice cold coke was my breakfast caffeine!  Mary Ann would be so proud of me! They had fresh fruit too, so I ate a banana with my tortilla and Nutella. 
I made my way to the privy.  Since the door opened to the woods I left it cracked.  I do that often for fresh air.  Today was special though. Right in front of me came a mama deer and her baby.  The baby was pretty big, but still at her mom’s side. I sat there and watched mom groom her little one.  Just like a dog or cat licks their babies. What a gift it was to witness that moment.  
Our hike was straight up and out this morning.  There were tons of rocks.  My feet are very angry with me again today.  Sometimes it hurts so bad when one of those pointy rocks stick my foot I actually cry out. It’s no joke.  
About 8 or 9 miles in we came to a road with a convenient store/deli on it.  We wanted real food, so we hiked the extra 0.3 miles uphill to check it out.  I had a cold diet Dr Pepper and tuna salad sandwich with dill pickle chips.  Yummy!!!! 
With full bellies the idea of walking back to our trailhead wasn’t appealing at all.  I met a lovely middle aged lady and struck up conversation.  She made room for us in her van and took us back to the trailhead.  I didn’t catch her name, but she was my Trail Angel today.  
The trail from there started out nice, wide, and soft.  As I walked along I watched a squirrel perform acrobatic moves!  He jumped from one tree to another doing a half twist in the middle!  I’ve seen lots of squirrels jump in my lifetime, but nothing like this!  I gave him a “10”...he stuck the landing.  
The rest of the trail was mostly rocks.  Hugs fell 2 or 3 times!  She had a rough day.   After a bit I came to the Shenandoah River.  I’ve sang about that river for years, and here I am!  And guess what else?  I’m in Harpers Ferry...WEST VIRGINIA!   
Virginia was beautiful.  I met some folks that I will remember forever, but after more than 500 miles, I’m thrilled to be past it!  I think I did get the Virginia Blues a little bit towards the end.  
Tomorrow will be a zero day in Harpers Ferry.  There’s so much history here I want to explore this quaint little town.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598502,"I woke up to the smell of waffles and coffee at the Teahorse Hostel. We all sat around the big tables talking about the trail, movies, and technology.  Surprisingly even the young hikers were impressed that I have given up TV.  They see the good in that decision. 
Today is my daughter Kayla’s birthday! She is 31 years old.  I’m so proud of her!  She’s a great mother, wife, and nurse. But mostly she’s an amazing daughter!  After breakfast I FaceTimed her(at work) and the whole crew sang happy birthday to her!  
After a quick trip to the Post Office Hugs and I began our exploration of Harpers Ferry.  Harpers Ferry was settled in 1773. The history of this town just seeps out between every red brick of these buildings.  In many ways the architecture reminds me of NOLA. Harpers Ferry is another city with a soul. 
Our first stop was the ATC headquarters.  We had our pictures and info taken. We are now officially logged in the archives as A.T. Thru-hikers 2018!  They have shelves there with binders full of pictures from years past.  It’s super cool to me that I am amongst them now. 
We continued to walk through the historical section of town. These old buildings are now shops and hostels or restaurants. There are several museums. We went into a few shops and admired the homemade soaps and unique jewelry.  Until we made our way into a local Pub-n-Grill.   I had baked Brie with honey & almonds on it and a salad. Delicious!
On to a few museums. Most of the history is based around slavery.  I’m not open for discussion on this, but I’m ashamed and appalled...my heart actually hurts.  Enough said. 
I grabbed a hand dipped ice cream for my after dessert dessert since I had ended up sharing a lava cake with Hugs after lunch.  This cannot continue once I’m off trail!  
We sweated our way back up the mountain streets to our hostel.  I will eat leftovers from last nights steak dinner tonight, and lay around with my feet up!

The morning started out with waffles again.  Coffee and a banana went with them marvelously! 
Sister Sticks and I enjoyed some conversation as we all prepared our things for bounce boxes to be picked up later down the trail.  Hugs and I said goodbye to her at the Post Office. She’s on her way toward some major flooding and will try to keep us updated on trail conditions.  
Hugs and I had planned to take the city bus to Walmart this morning since we let too much time slip away yesterday.  That was how we learned the bus does not run on Saturdays.  4.7 miles to Walmart...thumbs up.   
We walked a couple of residential blocks when a lovely lady named Beverly gave us a holler from her front porch.  She made sure we were going to Walmart, then offered up a ride. Beverly works with troubled youth.  I bet she’s perfect for that role.  It’s clear she has a heart of gold!  
Our walk took us past a forgotten old stone building.  I would love to breathe new life back into that thing.  It’s today’s photo. 
Walmart was Walmart...blech!! Shop local folks.  I really try to do that even during this hike, but sometimes out here it’s unavoidable and I’m forced to do differently.  
Bags in hand and slack packs on our backs we hit the road.  Thumbs up!  A very nice man from the other side of the road shouted that he’s running into Food Lion and will be one minute.  He was true to his word.  He brought us right back to the hostel because it’s basically next door to his own home.  His name is Glenn.  He was born and raised right here in Harpers Ferry and he’s an independent contractor.  
We love our Trail Angels!! 
We had a late lunch/early supper at The Anvil.  A restaurant next door.  I smelled the smoker all day yesterday, so today I had a delicious pulled pork sandwich!   It had that smoked gourmet flavor!!!  I would have loved just a big old bowl of meat!! 
Papa Big Swig FaceTimed me with a surprise appearance from Lisa, one of my besties!  I love her so much that I named my daughter after her. I miss the people I love more than anything while I’m out here hiking.  Her beautiful face brought tears to my eyes.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598721,"We left the Teahorse Hostel this morning. A Trail Angel named Tumbelina picked us up at 10am and drove us 20 miles north to do a SOBO flip flop slack pack.  I’m not sure who or what I expected, but out popped this cute little 25 year old girl.  She’s a thru-hiker and opens her home to a limited number of hikers for a nominal fee. She says this is her way of giving back.  
I am officially hiking in Maryland now!  This is what they call the Tri-State area where Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland come together. As Tumbelina was driving us to Washington Monument Park we drove through all three states.  
Getting ready to go this morning was lots of fun.  There were folks from all walks of life at the breakfast table.  Two young girls from California who are long time friends. One is a recent Harvard University grad currently working at a “think tank” in DC, and the other is a senior at Berkeley.  They are just enjoying a few days of friendship in Harpers Ferry and the surrounding area.  Another new college grad, trail named Moxie, is thru-hiking.  I think she started May 13th.  She’s already at the halfway mark!  There was a guy who did CDC work in Uganda recently, and an ex-Wall Street broker. One is just seeking a new path in life and the other is a section hiker.  There were some bicyclers, and our morning chef/hostel manager Benjamin.   
Breakfast was the exact same. Waffles, OJ, banana, and coffee.  I ate it all...again.  
Before Tumbelina picked us up I weighed my pack.  40 lbs. that’s too much!  I don’t know what I can get rid of. No worries today though as I will be slack packing. 
She dropped us off near a camping site and we set out to find the trailhead.  There was a bus parked in the camping section that looked like the Partridge Family bus.  A lady came out and pointed us in the right direction.  She even let us cut through her campsite to get there.  Trail Angels come in many forms.  
So we started walking south. Whenever I do a flip-flop it’s like a family reunion.  I get to see other NOBO’s that I may not have seen in a while.  Today started with Trail Walker. He’s still trucking along, but says his money is getting tight.  My money is tight too.  I’ve already spent my whole budget.  Thank God for Papa Big Swig who is helping me.  I had no idea how expensive it is to live like a minimalist!  
Everywhere and Cyborg gave me a shout from up the road. Looked like they were thumbing a ride into town.  
Today’s trail section is not only the Appalachian Trail, but also known as the Civil War Trail.  I enjoyed museums, historical markers, and more.  
By “more”, I’m referring to TRAIL MAGIC!   Guy and Charlene who are trail runners decided to treat us to some tasty, cooked right before our eyes,  Quesadilla’s!   They were delicious!  We are both so grateful as our day lasted longer than expected.  We would have been starving!  They are today’s photo.  Thank you to our wonderful Angels!  
I crossed paths again with the thru-hiker whose name I cannot remember.  Hugs and I continue to call him No Name.  He said he spent some time looking for my glasses, but also came up empty handed.  
Our hike took us past picnic areas and restrooms.  It was great!  
I was ahead of Hugs so I sat down at a picnic area and opened up my journal guestbook.  A message from a reader named Vicki brought tears of joy to my eyes.  How ironic that I read her message right then.  She had requested to meet me in that exact location today, but I didn’t see her message until it was too late to set a time. My apologies Vicki, I wish I had seen it sooner.   
To all of you who follow me, thank you!  Your words of encouragement and faith really do boost my spirits and help keep me going.  
I walked on over to the restrooms and ran into Sister Sticks.  She directed us towards the free museums.  I had a really nice educational time.  This place would be a great day hike experience for young families.  
Leaving the museums, the trail led us out of the park and back towards Harpers Ferry.  The path was wide and lovely most of the way, except for the rocky areas.  They were difficult in places, but overall it was easy peasy hiking.  
I saw something in nature today that I doubt I will ever see again. Hugs called me over to witness it. There was a daddy long legs spider pulling a live worm.  This worm had to weigh 10 times the spiders’ weight.  Another daddy long legs was trying to take the worm from the first one.  He was unsuccessful.  I had no idea that spiders kill and eat worms, but that’s exactly what was happening right before my eyes.  
That was a WOW moment, but we had to hike on.  We started late with a 20 mile day planned and we had already taken our time through the historical section.  
We came to a place they call the tow path...or toe path.  I’m not sure which it is.  Anyway it’s a gravel lane that runs right beside the Potomac River into Harpers Ferry.  How nice!  We made a left and walked and talked for a mile or so. It was then that we began to look for blazes.  Not a white blaze anywhere!  One look at our Guthook’s app and we realize we had turned the wrong way.  We just added two miles onto our day, and we can’t even count them.  AGAiN!  
We turned around and headed back the right direction.  My hiker hunger started kicking in.  If I had not had that quesadilla it would have been ugly!  Well uglier than it was anyway. 
The path actually had some beautiful moments.  I heard bullfrogs croaking from the old canal side, and  at the same time the Potomac was rushing by on the other side.  There were lots of wild roses and even a goose.   
We’re back at Tumbelina’s place tonight.  Tomorrow she’ll take us with our full packs right back where she took us today, but we will walk north.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598789,"I was the first person awake in the bunk room at Tumbelina’s place.  My left hip and low back have been painful for about two weeks now.  She has a large area rug in the middle of the room, so I decided to do some yoga.  It helps.  
Tumbelina drove us back to Washington Monument Park. She  parked near the big Partridge Family bus to let us out.  That same lady who was so kind to us yesterday nearly flipped her lid today.  “YOU CANT PARK THERE!”  Good grief!  I explained she’s not really parking we’re just getting out.  Poor lady was frustrated to stroke level in the less than 3 minutes we were there.  I apologized several times.  
The terrain was more of the same as yesterday.  Mostly wide smooth and fairly flat. There were a few rock scrambles but not bad.  
Soon we hiked right on up to a Washington Monument. A stone tower of sorts used by the Union Army as a signal station during the civil war.  It was built in 1827 and dedicated to the memory of George Washington.  
Within minutes of leaving the monument the sky became overcast.  We had already planned to stop at the first shelter anyway, but the weather just solidified that notion.  First there were sprinkles only, but then buckets of water was coming down out of the sky.  
Only 3.8 miles into the day, and it looks like Pine Knob Shelter is Home for the night.  
Hugs and I have giggled a lot about this NERO!  The physical strength it takes to hike 3.8 miles with a full pack! (Tongue-in-cheek). Today is Papa Big Swig’s birthday!  I hope he has the best day ever!  Happy birthday dear!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598950,"Around dawn I thought I saw Swiss Chris through my squinted eye.  Thirty minutes later I sat up to see that he was really there.  I met Swiss Chris and his hiking partner Avocado at Tumbelina’s place.  
Swiss Chris is a36 year old teacher from Switzerland. He’s here on a 6 months visa specifically to hike the A.T.   He met Avocado on trail. Avocado is a 20 something new college grad with an Environmentalist degree.  They had decided to try the 24 hour challenge. This is a challenge to hike from Virginia to a Pennsylvania in 24 hours.  I don’t know the exact mileage, but a lot of people do it. Apparently they started yesterday afternoon, but the rain and fog got the best of them.  They stopped at our shelter to eat and nap.  We haven’t seen them since we left this morning.  
We started out going up.  There were “stairs”, and lots of them!  Once I was at the top it was great.  The path was fairly smooth with occasional small rock scrambles.  It was still foggy, so I nearly walked right up on a deer before I saw her.  I got a nice photo before she hopped to the other side of the path.  I had no idea, but there was a second deer there. I accidentally scared the bejeepers out of them with my trekking poles.  It didn’t last long, but some time with wildlife was a nice treat this morning. 
I’m glad I was able to enjoy those deers because at that moment the terrain changed.  Rocks, rocks, and more rocks!  All shapes, sizes, and angles.  Rocks are difficult enough, but remember it rained last night?  Wet rocks can seriously be treacherous.   Hugs and I began to peck our way through.  
About 8 miles in I came to a shelter. We had already planned to meet there so I went on down, and to the privy.  As I was walking back from the privy I heard Hugs call my name.  She had fallen on a wet rock. Sometimes it doesn’t matter how careful you are.  
We took an hour long break.  Debated staying there or moving on.  The rain had held off and it was only 5 miles to the next shelter, so we decided to push on knowing we had 1200ft of UP. 
The air was heavy today. I guess from the fog.  All of this wetness and humidity made the fungi happy, and the toads happy!! I have been seeing these tiny little brown toads lately.  They’re so cute.  No bigger than a goldfish. 
I was pleasantly surprised when the forest opened up into a field.  The sun was trying to shine at that moment.  I was looking down at a farm and walking past a row of giant round hay bales. There were butterflies and sparrows flying around.  It just felt good to be there!  
Hugs caught up to me just I was going back into the woods.  The sun had not yet been able to dry up the woods. At least the rocks were gone, but it was muddy. I was on a decline in the mud when my turn to fall came up. Yep, down went McGinney! No injuries.  
I was covered in mud, but hiked on.  We crossed paths with a couple of local day hikers who told us of some trail magic in the creek. Cokes and water!  I only heard Cokes!  Whoever put them in the water for us to keep them cool was a genius, however they were literally in the middle of the creek.  I tried to stay above the water on rocks, but just couldn’t do it.  Both boots are soaked. But my Coke was delicious!  
We continued hiking to Raven Rock Shelter. This place is the resort of shelters! Wow!  So nice!  
I had breakfast for supper with hot chocolate to drink.  My belly is full and my heart is happy!!

Hugs and I took our time getting out of camp this morning. We had less than 5 miles to reach our extraction point.  It should have been a zip zoom hike, but the rocks were grueling. Every single step had to be taken cautiously. It took an extra hour to reach our destination.  
The only wildlife through this area was squirrels and spiders. There was also an abundance of mosquitoes!  I hate using deet but I had to do it today. 
I did find myself in a little pine forest. It smelled so clean and fresh.  At least that was a little something pleasant as I slowly picked my way through the rocks.  It was there where I trusted my footing on a slanted rock too much and nearly bit the dust.  I managed to save myself, but even a save doesn’t come without pain.   
Papa Big Swig texted me that he was at the park and going to start walking my direction with the dogs.  I was smiling the rest of the way.  In order to move forward I had to step right then step left over and over again. Still smiling though as I anticipated a greeting from home.  
Eventually I popped out of the woods into the park. No Papa Big Swig. No dogs.  Where was he?  I called his cell phone and he said he was southbounding to meet me.  Hmmmmm, he had taken a wrong turn somewhere.  About 20 minutes later there he was with my two favorite 4 legged people!   
My back and hip have been hurting for a good while, and getting worse, so Papa Big Swig took me to a walk-in clinic. I was given treatment but was also told to end my hike.  Not just take a break, but end it. 
We are in a hotel tonight. I plan to slack pack tomorrow and give my body a break. Papa Big Swig will slack me all the way to Maine if that’s what I want. I’m taking him up on that offer as much as he possibly can. After all, I’m accustomed to having pain. I didn’t come this far just to quit!

Exactly 0.3 miles into our hike we crossed the Mason Dixon Line.   I’m officially in Pennsylvania!  Also known as rocksylvania!  
The rocks aren’t horrible yet, but everything is flooded.  I was trekking through areas with water up to my shins in many places. AND the rain keeps falling.  
There was a chopper circling above for quite a while during the worst of the downpour. Hugs and I both wondered if it was a search and rescue.  We’re keeping our eyes open.  
The rain had let up a bit when I looked up and saw a small herd of deer off to the right.  Seylor was in front of me.  I just kept praying Dear God please do not let Seylor see the deer. I could only imagine standing in the rain for an hour while she chased them.  She did not see them.  
I stopped at a Shelter around noon for a snack.   Seylor also needs  her calories so she got a small bowl of food. It rained the whole time, but we were dry in the shelter.  
After lunch the rain slowed.  During a lull Seylor decided to chase something up and away from the trail. This is never good.   I walked slowly until I felt I had gone far enough away that she may have difficulty finding me again.  About 10 minutes later she came back with her tongue hanging out.  This happened several times today until I finally had to leash her up.  I was frustrated, so poor Seylor did the last 5 miles on her leash.   
During the time I spent waiting on Seylor it crossed my mind that I need to be more like dad.  He never got upset when dogs ran off in the woods. I can hear him now saying “he’ll come back sis”. I know dad is right.  Seylor always comes back.  I just don’t feel I have the time to wait while she galavants around anymore.  
So with my trekking poles in my left hand and her leash in my right  I put one soaked boot in front of the other.   We sloshed our way through a lot of water and mud.  Then God gave me a surprise!  The woods opened up to a field.  No more rain was falling, and I got a view!  It was a foggy view, but I’ll take it! 
All too soon we were back in the wet woods. The last couple of miles was a series of woods, then road crossing, then woods, then road crossing etc. there were a total of 3 road crossings.  
Today was the first time I’ve ever felt unsafe while hiking. Just before I came to the first road crossing a truck slammed on its brakes.  I could hear them sliding in the gravel.  Then it backed up and parked on the side of the road. I listened to the engine idle as I was getting closer to the road. I could also see that they were watching me through the trees. At first I just hoped they didn’t think I was a deer.  
So first Seylor popped out onto the road, then me. I quickly started walking across but the old brown truck was faster and pulled up beside me.   It was two guys probably mid twenties.  They began a series of questions first about my dog, then asking if my car was parked near by, to asking if I sleep in the woods.  They gave me the heebie-jeebies!  
I told them my dog was friendly until she came off her leash.  I also let them know my husband was picking me up, and by the grace of God, Hugs caught up to me right there. They drove off.  My gut says they were up to no good.  
Two more roads and there I was at the parking area where Papa Big Swig picked us up.  He’s still my knight in shining armor!

The sprinkles really only lasted about 5 minutes. We both took off our rain gear and enjoyed hiking below overcast skies. 
There were a couple of rocky areas, but over all the path was soft and wide.  I give credit for that to all of the soft pine trees around me. They were scattered throughout the entire forest today. These are the softest pine needles I’ve ever felt, and the scent is just lovely. 
During wet rainy days I like to look at the mushrooms.  They seem to be the happiest of everything in this weather!  Today I found the coolest purple mushrooms.  They are edible and they are called Deceivers.  I saw them in all different shades of purple and stages of growth.  
I had another detour today. A small section was closed due to flooding.   I’ve never followed Red Blazes before, but that’s what was there. They took us to a park area where we stopped at a pavilion for lunch. It was nice to have a real picnic table and a roof.   
We were able to hop back on trail right there.  I think mileage wise we probably added about a half mile only.  
A very short distance up the trail Hugs called out for me to come back.  She had a tick behind her ear.  We’re both permethrin treating our clothing tomorrow.  This will be my third time.  
At 3:30 the rains came again.  This time they stayed, and poured and poured for over an hour.  
We found refuge at Quarry Gap Shelter.  Wow! This place was amazing!  The “innkeeper” Jim Stauch takes his job seriously.  I cannot say enough good things about this shelter.  
The rains passed and we hiked on through lots of standing water.  It’s been like that for several days already anyway. My feet look like prunes!   I finally lost my first toenail.  Not bad for 1095 miles! 
We popped out of the woods at 6pm and made our way to the parking area where Papa Big Swig picked us up.  He was delayed in traffic so we decided to take a look further up the trail.  We’ll be heading into a beautiful pine forest when we start back.  It was there where I saw the fattest little porcupine running away from us down the trail.  I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a porcupine in the wild before. 
Tomorrow we’re taking a trip to REI for my next pair of boots.  I can’t believe I have over 500 miles on this pair already.  I’ll be taking a zero. Papa Big Swig and I will be having an early anniversary celebration!

First stop was the Post Office a town over. Hugs and I both had shipped/bounced some of our things forward to avoid carrying them through the rain.  
We had Red Robin for lunch!  I ate a burger, fries, and a salad.  We all split a huge piece of Mud Pie for dessert...extra whipped cream!   
Then we drove into Maryland to an REI.  I needed new boots. I didn’t realize how badly I needed them until today. It’s true you get about 500 miles per new pair.  I bet my feet will be happier with me when I’m hiking tomorrow!  
It was past supper time when we got back to the campground. By the time I put away my new things, and prepped for tomorrow’s hike, dinner just didn’t happen. String cheese and Doritos for me.  Ms. Thelma’s Apple cake for dessert! 
Hugs and I are definitely the caboose of thru-hikers. Most of our remaining bubble flipped up to Katahdin from Harpers Ferry.  We haven’t seen a thru-hiker in days.  
I will be slack packing  the next two weeks. I’m thinking I should make it to New York in that time. From there Papa Big Swig will drive Hugs and I to Maine.  I AM flipping.  After I come back down from Katahdin I plan to hike south back to New York where I will complete the trail.

We hiked right on in to Pine Grove Furnace State Park. This is where the half gallon ice cream challenge takes place.  I ate a hamburger only and called it a day.  The burger was extremely tasty!! 
Right up the road was an A.T. Museum. It was a nice little museum with a great children’s section!  Hugs and I met a lovely lady there named Iris.  She dreams of thru-hiking....I hope she gets to do it one day!  
Shortly after leaving the museum we did meet a real SOBO, trail named Skip. He will finish his hike at 3 Little Pigs in Daleville VA. Free banana pudding!  What a great ending! 
The terrain was fantastic today, but lots of my hike was just miserable because of the unbelievable amount of mosquitoes!  When I was holding my trekking poles and swinging my arms while walking, I could literally feel the mosquitoes bouncing off of my arms and hands. It was horrible!  
The only wildlife today was birds.  I hope they have bats in Pennsylvania because there’s a smorgasbord of skeeters for them tonight. I’m not looking forward to coming back into them tomorrow.  
I did cross many creeks and footbridges the last couple of miles.  Thunder was coming from the south, but no rain fell.  I popped out onto Old Town Road first and paced back and forth while waiting for Hugs. I couldn’t even stand still because of the mosquitoes. When she got there we began walking in the direction Papa Big Swig would be coming from.   
Boots will be back on tomorrow!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599515,"We started our hike back in the mosquito haven.  We both sprayed good with repellent and put our nets on right away.   It was not quite as bad as yesterday, but still unbearable.  
We started out going UP.  The first climb was about 1150ft.  The whole morning was up and down like that with similar climbs. 
Rocksylvania is beginning to show up here and there.  I had several climbs where I threw my poles up then pulled myself up.  If I had been wearing a pack I would have definitely had to drop pack and throw it several times.  My back is so grateful that Papa Big Swig is willing to slack pack me like he is. 
Speaking of Papa Big Swig, today is our anniversary!  Happy Anniversary Dear!  Cheers to many more!!!
It’s a scorcher today.  Somewhere in the low-mid 90’s.  All of the animals must be taking refuge in highly shaded areas because the only sign of wildlife today was a grey toad....and of course the gross amount of mosquitoes.  
Just as I was coming down from Center Point Knob (1099ft) Hugs sent me a text. She was a good distance behind me, and she was sick.  I offered to go back but she declined. After vomiting and resting she managed to continue.    
I sent a text to Papa Big Swig that we will be ending early today. We were 2-3 miles from Boiling Springs PA, and he could pick us up there.   
Very shortly after texting I walked out of the woods into a field.  Most of the rest of my hike into Boiling Springs was like this. I loved it!  Corn fields on both sides of me felt like home.  A trail jogger came past me and turned to say “happy anniversary”!   He had stopped to help Hugs when she was sick.  She must have told him today is my anniversary.  Most folks on the trail are like this.  Super nice! 
I made it into Boiling Springs well enough ahead to enjoy some history. This town is  known for manufacturing iron. I got to see an old iron furnace. It’s made of stone, and the size of a two story house.  I’m going to have to research Boiling Springs, because it’s obvious there’s a bigger story than I was able to see. 
Papa Big Swig picked us up and drove 12 miles to an outdoor archery place so I could buy more Sawyer picaradin insect repellent.   I’m sure I was bitten by at least 30 mosquitoes today. Hugs is even worse. 
Since I got back to the campground early I treated all of my clothing with permethrin.  I treated my new boots too.  Because on top of the mosquitoes outside we had a tick in the camper!!! 
On a positive note Papa Big Swig and I are getting a date night for our anniversary!  Ice cream and a movie!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599644,"Papa Big Swig dropped us off at PA rt 850 where we would southbound back to Boiling Springs.  This was a strategic flip today with less incline and a convenient pick-up location for Papa Big Swig. However, it took us 20 minutes to actually find the trail this morning, but once we got going it was smooth sailing. 
As soon as I entered the woods. going UP, there was a concrete trough of sorts to my left. I watched a big old frog take a dive into the murky green water that filled it, and at the same moment a crow began to caw on my right.  It just felt like this was going to be a great day!!!  I love it when the forest says “good morning” to me like that! 
A little more than a mile up the trail was a shelter.  I stopped for the privy, and we both had a little snack.  It has come to my attention that the very best shelters I’ve seen so far are in Pennsylvania. With the exception of one in Maryland. 
I need to make a quick correction while I’m thinking of it. I said two weeks to get to New York, but it’s going to be closer to 3 weeks.  
I’ve also got two questions to answer. Just as well do that while it’s in my brain too. 
First is for Terodactyle I think I was #1608 at Harpers Ferry. Don’t hold me to that though.  
Second is for Kelly S. I sent a box general Delivery with a message to hold for myself AT thru-hiker. The P.O. will hold my box for 30 days. Back to my day: 
So the first 4 or 5 miles I hiked beside a muddy river.  The river was so dark that it reminded me of the Mighty Mississippi... on a much smaller scale.  
Of course all of that water was just another mosquito playground. Today was much better than the previous two days though. After my permethrin treatment and Picaradin spray I only had one bite today!  
So I was pretty much able to ignore the swarms of mosquitoes around me and focus on the things I love.  A female cardinal flew in front of me. She looked very busy.  I don’t think this is a time for her to be nesting, but maybe so.  I also enjoyed listening to the cicadas.  It was really just like a concert out there today.  Sooo relaxing! 
The trail took a turn out of the woods and I was right there in a cornfield.  I love hiking through farmland.  The trail literally runs between two rows of corn.  I could reach out and touch it.  It was there where I saw a little red beaver make a dash back into the woods towards the river.   
Hugs was close behind me when I exited the field right onto a residential road. There was a nice shady space on the edge of someone’s lot so we pulled out our sit-upons, and sat.  I carried a tuna salad sandwich with me today. A fresh sandwich is one of the perks of slack packing.  It was a delicious lunch and went down well with my Crystal Light lemonade.  
We had a short walk on the road from there until we went back into the woods.  Once in the woods I turned left but should have gone right.  It didn’t take too long to figure that out. Hugs made a quote of the day “there’s the trail”!  It should be quote of the hike!  Hiking in and out of personal property and residential areas makes it easy to take a wrong turn.  
Once I was back on the right path the woods had lots of treats for me. I watched a baby deer leap through the woods like a graceful ballerina. 
Then I came upon an old family cemetery. Some of the headstones dated back to the late 1800’s.  The newest one that I saw was 1989.  The whole cemetery was on a raised plot of land with wrought iron fencing around it. It was a peaceful place. 
Just when I thought we would never see another NOBO this late in the game, there he was!  His name is Solo, and he’s a new college grad. He started at Springer on May 25th. I’m so embarrassed!  
There I was right back in another cornfield.  I saw a bigger deer across the field cantering towards the woods.  Then a baby bunny sat right on the path in front of me until I pulled out my phone...of course. I loved the smell of the corn and watching grasshoppers flit all around.  There were also a few different butterflies today.  Mostly the Royal blue and black ones, with some all white ones mixed in there.  This was Gods painting for sure! 
I crossed a road and went back into the woods for the last 2 miles of my hike.  There was a house to my left where lots of gunshots were being fired.  It sounded like target practice but was super close.  I was a little leery of going in the woods behind that house at first, but soon could tell the shots were going the opposite direction.  The gunshots stopped within a couple of minutes leaving me with my favorite chirps and tweets for the rest of my hike.  
The very last cool thing I saw was the most intricate spiderweb ever. It’s my photo of the day.  Photos really aren’t good enough to truly appreciate this work of art. The web literally had levels like floors and back in the narrow point at the base was a little tan spider waiting patiently for dinner.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599811,"As soon as we hopped out of the SUV this morning we saw a deer grazing in a field on some big round hay bales.  That field was the start of my hike today. She saw us coming, and gracefully made her way into the woods.  
Once I made it to the woods my hike started UP.  1328ft elevation to be exact.  The heat index is high right now, so my clothing was soaked from sweat before I was 1/4 way up. 
From the top I crossed over a grassy area with a view to another mountain.  The fog was still low when I was up there so it was only a partial view for me.  There was tall grasses and various flowers on each side of the narrow path.  Bees were busy flying from flower to flower.  One of them somehow went in my boot and stung me through my sock on my ankle.  This is not the first time that’s happened to me. I wonder what looks so inviting to a bee inside my boot?  
I was in the lead today and left to my own thoughts.  It’s crazy the amount of things that go through my mind.  Today I was thinking of dad.   He was a grateful person.  He took care of everything he ever owned as if it it were the last one on earth. He NEVER complained.  Even when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.  I remember he looked up at mom and said “I’ll do my best to fight this, but if it doesn’t work out, it’s been a good life”.  I NEED to be more grateful.  I’m not guaranteed anything in this life but I’ve been blessed far beyond what I deserve.  I’m working on true gratitude. 
I was walking along watching chipmunks scurry around. My chirps and tweets were making me happy, when I just happened to look up to my right.  There, just going over a Ridge, was the backside of what I believe was a bobcat.  I’m going to research and find out if they are around these parts, because I feel pretty confident it was.  
Just as I passed a brown toad, I came to my first real Pennsylvania View!  I’m very much enjoying PA, even the rocks that stuck around all day today.  
Hugs and I enjoyed a snack near the view before taking off again. I was a little ways ahead when I came around a bend in the trail to find a young deer munching on the leaves and berries growing beside the trail.  She wasn’t afraid of me.  I took several pictures and backed up to wait for Hugs.  When Hugs arrived she was still there. As we walked towards her she just moved a little further down the trail.  Eventually she stepped off to the side and let us pass. It was an awesome experience. 
Before long we popped out on to a road leading us to Duncannon Pennsylvania.  There was a nice hikers mural painted on one of the buildings downtown. Sadly that’s the ONLY positive thing I have to say about Duncannon.  
Papa Big Swig texted me that he was waiting for us at our pick-up location already. It was 2 miles away.  We had spent a lot of time with our deer today and were behind schedule.  He just drove over and picked us up.  It was a short day, but a good one!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599928,"On our way to the start location this morning Hugs asked if it felt like I was going to work.  Some days it does, but very much unlike any other job I’ve ever had. Sometimes it’s hard to get going, but the days are always good.  
I was greeted by a rushing creek this morning.  The woods had the feel of rain, but no drops fell.  It was nice feeling cool dampness as I began my first climb up 1386ft. The grade was steep. 
I was pretty much by myself all morning.  I walked in silence listening to the sounds of a chainsaw coming up from farmlands below. There were occasional chirps and tweets, and sometimes all I could hear was the breeze blowing by my ears.  
I love the breeze!  
The woods was pretty still today except for the always busy and always present Daddy Longlegs.  I’m convinced they rule the woods at night! There is literally one or two of them on every rock. 
Feeling like nothing was happening in the woods today, I was taken completely by surprise when a really BIG Grouse flew off to my right.  I jumped a foot in the air!  Then a few more feet up the trail a second one did the same thing.  My heart was pounding in my chest for a few seconds.  I guess Grouse come in pairs.  
That was enough excitement for one morning. I was close to a shelter and it was almost noon.  Hugs and I had planned to meet there for lunch so I took the blue blaze.  I had already eaten my chicken salad sandwich before Hugs arrived.  I also packed fresh cherries. Mmmm good! It was a great lunch! 
After lunch I tried to put the hammer down. Still had 12 miles to go and today I had a time constraint for a late chiropractor appointment.  
I noticed several nice little campsites along the trail. Pennsylvania does a great job with them too.  Today’s lunch shelter was more of the same.  Absolutely fabulous! 
Just past the Tentsite,  coming towards me was Solo!  Hugs and I did a flip back to Duncannon today so we got to see him again.  I was quite surprised actually, because I really figured he had blown by us.  No other NOBOs are out there though. They’ve all either flipped, quit, or pulled ahead.   
Today’s terrain was ever changing.   There were lots of rocks!  Three or 4 times I had to climb boulders.  At one point I felt it was a little dangerous. Large boulders about the size of a VW Beetle WERE the ridge...on a slant!  I managed to scrape my knee but otherwise made it through like a pro.  There were a few open spaces between peaks with great views of the town below. 
I have noticed that I feel very close to towns, or roads while hiking this area.  I frequently hear cars drive by, or city noises coming up the mountain from below.  
The noises don’t seem to bother the deer though. Today I came upon a fawn grazing on leaves and berries. She was so cute with her little white spots.  I saw a large deer just a few minutes later.  She tried to hide from me in the bushes... it didn’t work!  
Shorty after the big deer I began my 3 mile descent into Duncannon.   Papa Big Swig was there patiently waiting for us. We grabbed a pizza to go for dinner so I could make my 8pm chiropractor appointment on time.  I did, and he was great.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600017,"Today was a planned leapfrog.  That means we skipped a section and jumped ahead. In this case it was 15 miles. Tomorrow we will continue with our leapfrog then we’ll go back and pick it up on Sunday. It’s nice slack packing, but planning drop-offs and pick-ups takes some creativity sometimes.  
I will say, my back is feeling much better! Slack packing, meds(just finished them this morning), and the chiropractor have all been helping. I’m grateful for that!  Lookout Katahdin here I come!  
The trail started out much like a Forest Service road today.  I checked and rechecked my Guthook’s app to make sure I was REALLY on trail.  I was.  
Early on we ran into a couple of NOBO’s.  This leapfrog thing let us see that there really are others out there!  Today we met Sticks and Spills. They started at Springer on April 13.  I felt a little more okay with my location knowing that. 
We came to a clearing in the woods near a view.  There was a big log  just the right height for a sit upon and a fanny.  Two guys were there.  I never caught their names, but they are brothers who are section hiking Pennsylvania.  Hugs and I were both heading to the overlook when one of them warned us of a Copperhead. Yay!!!  All I needed was a picture of a Copperhead to complete my photo mission.  There it was!!! 
I sat on the log and had a piece of leftover pizza for lunch. Orange flavored Tang washed it down. With a full belly I took off for the last half of my hike. Rocksylvania reared it’s head again! 
Somewhere on those rocks a familiar face showed up. It was Noteworthy! He stayed in a shelter with us just outside of Harpers Ferry.  He plans to flip up to Katahdin after his hike today.  We may see him somewhere up there again. 
Eventually the rocks became a narrow dirt path with lush green ferns on both sides. I watched a tiny toad hop into the ferns as I was walking towards it.  
The path came down to a road crossing that eventually took me to an iron bridge.  It was built in 1890 by the Berlin Iron Bridge Company.  The craftsmanship was exemplary from the iron beams to the wooden walkway. 
There was one last little hill to go over before I reached Papa Big Swig.  I had the pleasure of hiking through a rhododendron tunnel on the way.  No blooms, but I loved the canopy.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600168,"I didn’t sleep much at all last night. When I finally did fall asleep a storm came rolling through.  I love a storm, but my dog does not. She made sure we were all awake.  
At first I thought today would be an unplanned zero.  Hugs and I were both on board for that, but we knew we needed 10 more miles to make our weekly goal.  
It has rained so much in Pennsylvania that last nights storm had turned the trail into a flowing creek. The first mile I hiked through water ranging from ankle deep to mid-shin deep.  Needless to say my feet, socks, and boots were drenched all day.  
There was a historical marker on the trail today. A local explained that I was hiking right on the borderline where the French & Indian War took place.  The marker identified a site where a fort had been. It was used as a lookout for enemies.  I’ve enjoyed my history lessons along the way.   
So Hugs and I very carefully made our way up the creek.  We both had several missteps and near Falls. Hugs came up with a mission statement for the day “to stay upright”.  We both managed a fall free day!  
Our lunch break was at a View today. It was located exactly on the 1200 mile mark.  Don’t get too excited, I’m not really at 1200 miles yet. Remember I have to go back and make up that 15 mile gap from this week’s leapfrog.  I’ll be doing that tomorrow.  I’ll also post my 1200 mile view tomorrow and celebrate!  
After lunch the trail became pretty rocky.  Rocks require much more attention, and wet rocks require laser focus!  Hugs had the lead for a while. We kept our eyes down as we walked and talked. Our conversation turned to Big Kahuna.  We sure do miss him.  
Suddenly, without warning, there was a crack of lightning and a boom of thunder.  Within seconds it was pouring rain. The thunder and lightning continued right along with it.  I’ve never had such a big storm  just pop up from nowhere like that before!  
We both put on our rain gear and continued UP.  This storm hit just as the terrain changed from rocky to rockier.  Undeterred, we stayed focused and climb right up to the top of that mountain amidst the storm. We are two tough women!   
45 minutes later the sun was back out as though no storm had ever been. I came to a misty view where a very young Amish couple were sitting on the cliff looking out. I took a picture of the view then hiked down and through ferns and toads.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600240,"I avoid putting My boots on until the last minute if they’re wet, but this morning I broke down and put them on before I climbed into the SUV. My socks were soaked before I got back out to start hiking.  
Today will be a busy day.  Hugs and I are filling in our 15 mile gap while Papa Big Swig moves our camper to a campground farther north.  We’re making progress!  My favorite 4 legged hiker joined us for some trail fun today. 
When we entered the woods we were greeted by a bubbly little creek. The water was clear and the sound was music to my ears.  
Right past the creek was a marker in memory of Cyrus C. Sturgis Jr.  The marker labeled that location as being the end of the Horseshoe Trail which originated in Valley Forge.  Also calling Mr Sturgis a linguist, translator, and trail companion.   I’ll have to do some research on him and the Horseshoe Trail.  
After the marker I took the lead and Hugs and I separated. We just hike at different paces. So I was alone with my thoughts again.  I found myself hiking through another rhododendron tunnel.  I have not seen rhododendrons in some time, but suddenly here they are two days in a row. I watched chipmunks run across the forest floor while I was singing a Blake Shelton song in my head.(Austin) 
It was getting close to lunchtime so I slowed down to wait for Hugs. Seylor had been looking back for her for quite a while anyway.  Seylor likes to keep her pack together.  Hugs took the lead to get us to a tentsite for lunch.  We were walking and talking when I took a step on a slippery rock, and BOOM!!!  Down went McGinney...this one hurt.  I took 2 Aleve and just hope it’s not going to be a step backwards with my back.  
I shook it off as best I could and walked on to the tentsite. We pulled up a log and sat on our sit-upons.  Papa Big Swig had made me a chicken salad sandwich for lunch.   It was delicious!    I ate some Doritos and drank water with that.   We took about a 20 minutes break and I definitely felt better afterwards.  
Once I was back on trail it began to rain.  More wet rocks!  My coordination skills are being put to the test.  I used to think I was really well coordinated!  
I used my rain gear but by the end of the day, I don’t know why I even bothered.  As I came into Rausch Gap there were more and more areas of standing water. Rausch Gap has a story too.  It used to be a mountain village from 1828 to 1910.  Eventually the industry’s they relied on failed or moved and the village became nonexistent.  
Everybody left Rausch Gap except the beavers!   Yep beavers!  Soon enough i found myself walking knee deep in water because of a beavers dam.  This thing was impressive!   I’m going to say it was about a quarter mile long, and held back a good amount of water. It was a true beavers paradise, hikers nightmare.  My shorts were soaked up past the cargo pockets.  
Once I made it past the dam the trail significantly improved. The path was wide and soft.  Up ahead I saw a bright orange something.   Was it a tent?  I couldn’t tell.  Soon enough I could see it was a sign about the pipeline.  Then I looked right and saw excavated land.  It makes me so sad. 
The forest opened up right there, and I hiked in a field for a while.  I felt the warm sun and enjoyed watching butterflies fly from flower to flower.  
I went back into the woods and had one last creek to cross before my hike would end.  There was not a “good” way to cross this thing.  Eventually myself Hugs and Seylor just walked right through.  It was up to my thigh!   
We had a twenty minutes wait for Papa Big Swig. I dried out a little in that time.  Looks  like wet boots will go back on tomorrow.   Our poor feet!

I do know it rained for 24 hours straight!  Apparently Pennsylvania has made the national news for flooding. AND, as luck would have it, the rain started again before we even got out of the camper.  I’ve been in wet boots for a bunch of days now...what’s one more?
All of the  stars must have aligned just right, because when I got out of the vehicle the rain stopped again! And so my hike began on a muddy trail. Every step I took made that slurpy suction sound as it pulled my boot slightly off my heel. My heel would slide back down inside my boot until it was suctioned off over and over again.   The sounds it made were comical! 
I hiked through a controlled burn area today.  It was over several miles of my hike and made me kind of sad. I know there’s good reason for controlled burns, but it makes the forest look haunted and dead.  The only animals I saw were toads.  Not even birds or squirrels or chipmunks.  
As I hiked up into higher elevation the trail became less muddy and more rocky.  It’s definitely one or the other in Pennsylvania! The rocks were brutal today.  Up there though at least things were green and lush. Just the way I like it!  
I waited up there for Hugs so we could take a blue blaze to the Eagle’s Nest Shelter.  I could see it was a good ways off trail, but it felt like it took forever to get there.  I apologized to Hugs.  Normally I would just eat on trail rather than go that far off trail.  But it turns out this was a happy accident! We were lucky enough to be eating lunch in a covered shelter when the thunder boomed and a big downpour started!  
After lunch we put on our rain gear and took the forever blaze back to the trail.  I took the lead again and before long we were separated too far apart to talk.  
The rain let up just as I spied a hiker coming towards me.  It was a SOBO.  A real thru-hiker.  His trail name is Squatch.  I can’t remember his start date, but he’s been pounding out the miles!  Pennsylvania is his home state, so he’s going to take some zeros to visit everybody while he’s here. 
It was wet and gloomy in the woods but after saying “happy trails” to Squatch I walked out into an open area. I could feel the sun for the first time all day.   Butterflies were bouncing up and down on the wind.  For a few minutes it felt like a lovely summer day.   
Soon enough the clouds were looming overhead again.  I was just beginning my descent into Port Clinton PA.  I must have climbed much higher than I thought today.  The descent took a couple of hours and was really steep in several places.  It was pretty physically demanding coming down off that mountain.  
I made it down, all in one piece.  I waited at the train station for Hugs just as the rains began to fall again. Papa Big Swig picked us up.  It had been a rough day!  
My back is spasming pretty badly. I think that last fall may have really created a problem.  I’m lying on an ice pack right now.  I’ll see the chiropractor again on Thursday.  Say a prayer for me. I don’t want a back injury to take me out.

I’m back at Sloth pace.  It was hot and humid, and a long ways UP.  Slothing got me there.  
Once I reached the top I stopped for a minute to text with Papa Big Swig.   I know better than to try to text while actively hiking.   Hugs made it up there and passed me by while I was texting.  All done, I put my phone in my pocket, grabbed my trekking poles, and took one step.  BOOM! Down I went.  One slippery rock and it was all over.  I was hurt.  
My left shoulder popped out of place and right back in place just as fast. I landed on a small boulder with my left hip.  My back went into spasms instantly.   I have scratches and bruises to both legs, and I ache everywhere!   I’m really soooooo sick and tired of falling!   
Hugs came back to help me. Just as we were assessing all of my appendages a NOBO we had met yesterday came by.   His name is No-Chill and he started on March 26.  That’s the exact same day as Hugs.   
We walked together as a group for a while before No-Chill moved on quickly.  I really couldn’t walk much faster. 
We passed two SOBO’s before pulling up a big rock to take a seat for lunch.  Today we stopped at a Tentsite instead of blue blazing to a shelter.  
After lunch we quickly got separated again.  Rocks rocks rocks!  All of which lead me to Pulpit Rock View.   It was a beautiful PA View.   
Back on trail I met a SOBO named Caterpillar.  Shortly behind him was a dad with two kids.  They are 8 and 10 years old. They’re also SOBO thru-hikers.  Hugs and I talked to the kids(Fizzy & Bear)a good while.  They are very bright children!  They knew about calories and hiking.  They’re both taking in about 3500 calories a day.   They look happy and healthy! It was a great little conversation!   I wish them success on the rest of their journey. 
We came down out of the rocks onto a service road. It felt too good to be true, but Guthook’s confirmed I was on the right path.  We got nearly 2 miles of service road walking before heading back up into the woods. 
We popped out onto the road about 15 minutes before Papa Big Swig was due to arrive.   We decided to walk on down and checkout the Eckville Shelter.  I’m not sure what I expected, but it wasn’t really anything special at all.  
We watched a small herd of deer cross the road just before our chariot arrived.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600613,"Today was the planned zero day.  We took it even though we had an unplanned zero on Monday. 
As much I wish I could have just stayed in bed and rested, I had things to do.  It started with a 9am chiropractor appointment.   That went about as well as it could.  My back is just in an acute phase right now, EVERYTHING hurts!  My adjustment hurts, sitting hurts, standing hurts, bending hurts, coming up from bending hurts a lot, and I won’t even try a twist or turn. 
We had breakfast at a mom and pop place.  It was really good!   I had S.O.S.   The gravy was just like my mom used to make. Mmmmm good! 
My feet were in bad shape from being wet so much, so all three of us went for a pedicure.  My feet feel so much better!  
Then we headed into New Jersey to go to REI. I’m now fully equipped with Permethrin and Picaradin. Deer ticks are horrendous in this area. I also got one more pair of boots. I know I’m going to need them before this is over.  
I also needed to get the hand loops on my trekking poles replaced.  I thought REI did that, but they don’t.  Now I’ve got to contact Black Diamond or figure it out on my own.  REI didn’t even sell replacement loops.  Ugh!  
I’m about to do laundry and get my gear ready for tomorrow....then I’ll rest.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600749,"Rocks, rocks, and more rocks...the end!  
We did a SOBO flip-flop today.  The only critters I saw were toads.   Some of them are so tiny they’re only about the size of a marble.  
The terrain started out ok but eventually it turned into large rocks and boulders.  I spent two hours navigating through that.  
When we reached the top, Hugs and I sat down for a little break.  While sitting up there, I heard a loud expletive from below.  It was a section hiker.  He couldn’t believe the climb he was looking at.  We couldn’t either, which is why we were taking a break.   We started moving on before he made it up, but eventually he caught us and asked to pass.  He introduced himself as Jersey.  Just as he started he pass he slipped on a wet rock and went down.  He was able to hang on to a big boulder so he didn’t go down the side but he lost his Gatorade.  I’m so glad Hugs and I didn’t have to go into work mode.  
Once we got over that rock mass the terrain became decent again.  I saw the coolest looking red mushroom. I thought red mushrooms were only in storybooks or cartoons. 
We stopped at a shelter for lunch.  Padre was there. He’s a section hiker from Ocala Florida. He’s a really nice guy who decided to take a break from the rocks and call it a day at the shelter.   
From there it was more of the same.  Mostly rocks with short intervals of smaller or fewer rocks.  Oh how I miss my ridges and switchbacks!  
At least it didn’t rain today, and the breezes were nice.  Sometimes all I could hear was the wind rustling leaves in the trees.  
I saw a few more toads before I popped out onto the road where Papa Big Swig was waiting.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600788,"We got off to an early start this morning.  Seylor came with us today.  It’s been a while since she’s had a hiking day, and she loves being out there chasing squirrels. 
Right away the trail turned to rocks and boulders.  Every step had to be taken cautiously, and just like that Hugs fell. We had not been out there an hour yet.  
There were no squirrels or chipmunks on the rocks.  I mostly saw spiders, and during the “less rocky” moments there were lizards and caterpillars.  
By “less rocky” I mean there were still rocks, but I could actually see soil between them.  I still couldn’t take a solid step.  
I met a couple groups of people on the rocks. They were hiking from the other direction.  I can’t imagine living locally and choosing this area to hike in.  There are many parts of the trail  I want to re-visit, but Pennsylvania is definitely NOT one of them!  It’s a little sad that I feel this way, because I genuinely like the folks I’ve met from this area.  Really good people!  
After having about all I could take of rocks, a nice little reprieve came.  At times I was hiking between ferns that were as high as my waist on each side. Other times I could see the town below.  As bad as the rocks were, this part was equally as good.  Seylor took a moment to make her own blue blazes.  It was peaceful, at times the only sounds were my footsteps and the jingle of Seylor’s tags on her collar.   
There was a shelter right on trail. We had pre-planned to meet there for lunch so Seylor and I stopped.  I fed her good at lunch.  Those rocks were difficult for her and she burned a lot of energy keeping her balance making her way through the scrambles.  
Sitting there was another NOBO thru-hiker trail named Sugar Pants.  He’s here from Australia and has to fly back October 2nd.  He says he’s given up on the idea of seeing Katahdin.  It was a little heartbreaking to hear.  
Hugs arrived in time to meet Sugar Pants. We ate our lunch and continued down the mountain.  I could see we were coming to the Lehigh River and a road so Seylor spent a while on her leash.  We crossed the river and a highway then started UP.  
Soon it went from rocks to boulders. Then from hiking to mountain climbing.  The sun was at its highest and there was no shade. My poor dog!  I had to lift her several times.  Then hugs would lift and push while I grabbed and pulled.  This is not a place for dogs.  I felt horrible.  She was obviously scared.  At times her legs were trembling while she balanced herself on narrow or sharp pointy edges.  She’s such a trooper.   With lots of encouragement she kept on going even though it was clear she was beyond her limit.  She drank all of her water that she carried. I started filling her bowl from my camel back.  Before long we were both out of water.  The blazing sun was brutal, the mountain was brutal. If I had time, I would have cried.  
Finally the worst was over and Seylor and I were relieved to be hiking on Blue Mountain Ridge at 1419ft elevation. She still laid down every opportunity she got.  It was killing me to see her like that.  I would pause often and enjoy the view from the ridge so she could rest.   The village below was so small and cute.  I doubt there was even a grocery store. I could picture a beautiful winter scene down there with kids ice skating and a snowman in someone’s front yard.  I wish I knew the name of that village.  I really enjoyed it from afar.  
I came to a pine forest up there.  These pines were less fragrant than others I’ve come across on the trail.  The needles were far more bristled too.  I still enjoyed them. They went right along with the winter scene I had in my mind.  
Seylor and I waited on a cool rock for Hugs before we headed down the last half mile.  It was rocky going down, but the kind where you can see soil.  Sprinkles started to fall with about 100 yards to go.  I welcomed them.  This day was brutal.  
When I saw Papa Big Swig I fell to tears.  I was so worried about Seylors health. And to think I did that to her.   I had no idea the terrain was that bad, or I never would have taken her.  
I got my crying out on the ride back to the camper.  When we arrived,  there was a package from Big Kahuna waiting for us.   He had made photo books for Hugs and I.  Each book was special to us. Mine was titled “For Dad”.  Oh my goodness... I fell to tears again!  Happy tears this time! Big Kahuna is the best trail brother I could have. I miss him every day!  As a matter of fact I said to myself during the hike, this would be easier if Big Kahuna was here.  He always took the lead if the climbs were dangerous and paved the safest path for us girls.  Hurry back Big Kahuna!  
So with happy thoughts I took a shower and put on my best “hiker chic” attire for a campground party tonight. Wine, cheese, and an 80’s band!  It was a blast!  The lead singer brought attention to Hugs and I for thru-hiking. They performed a song for us by CCR...Up Around The Bend.  
A great ending to a completely miserable hike....

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600832,"Well I spent two hours constructing today’s journal entry and somehow it was deleted. It’s off my phone. It’s not even in my deleted folder. Sadly this will now be short and sweet. Yesterday our trekking poles were just a nuisance.  We would throw them up to the next level and pray they stayed where we threw them. Anticipating more of the same we left our poles behind today. We also didn’t carry a backpack.  Equipped with fanny packs only we set out for our Nero.  Almost instantantly I missed my poles.  I use them for stabilizing myself if the terrain is uneven, and more importantly I use them to take out spider webs!  I was spitting and sputtering way too much for my liking, so I grabbed a stick.  I called it my Harry Potter wand as I was making circles with it taking out webs.   The terrain was rocky today, but manageable. I could actually look at the forest around me and take in all it has to offer.  I stopped to take a photo of the beauty.  I hiked through another pine forest today.  This time it was the soft fragrant pines. Pine needles carpeted the ground, and that felt so good on my joints!    There were some significant rock scrambles going down the mountain to where Papa Big Swig waited for us today.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600943,"My morning started with a chiropractor appointment.  I really like this guy here.  Wish I could put him in my back pocket for the rest of the hike.   
It was chilly again this morning.  When we arrived at our starting location, my tank top just wasn’t enough.   Papa Big Swig gave me the shirt right off his back.  I was grateful.  
The terrain continues to be mostly rocks.  My feet hate me again!  However, I am so glad I bought new boots just before dealing with this Rocksylvania business! 
It was a good day for wildlife.  I came out to a grassy clearing between two mountains and looked up to see two Golden Eagles! Wow!  Who knew PA had eagles?!?
I hiked on with a smile, right back into the woods and right back onto the rocks.  They are so jagged and uneven. Sometimes I was knock kneed and others I was bow legged.  A normal gait is impossible. 
Hugs and I chose to meet at a tentsite for lunch.  I arrived first.   As I walked to the log that we would sit on, I noticed a rock with a blaze on it.  I said to myself, “ why on earth would anybody carry that bowling ball sized rock to the tentsite?”  
I dropped my pack and grabbed my wipes. I started searching for an appropriate tree. As I passed the rock with the blaze I realized the blaze wasn’t painted on the rock...it was a REAL blaze!  A tree bark blaze!  I can’t believe it!  Yesterday I found a fragile piece of tree bark blaze. It wasn’t whole, but almost. I was going to take it home, but I accidentally bumped it with my Harry Potter stick causing it to fall and break.  I can’t believe a whole one was right there today!  I can’t wait to put it in a shadow box with my thru-hiker certificate.  
After lunch we hiked down to Wind Gap. It was straight up from there. I think it was only 600ft but the steep grade made for some hard work.  
I met a couple of SOBO’s up there. First was 1K. He just graduated from college with a degree in botany.  He does landscaping in Florida. He was a super nice young man!  Right behind 1K came Blood Hound. He’s the second Blood Hound I’ve met this year.  
I took the lead after we talked with our SOBO’s.  It’s so rocky that I rarely get a chance to look into the forest, but I heard a rustling to my right and looked up.  There was a mama deer with her baby. The baby still had white spots.  I love that! 
Less than a mile further up the trail was another deer. I watched its little white tail jump into the ferns and hide behind trees.  
I hiked on over the rocks.  16 miles of rocks really wears on your feet.  At one point a sharp one stabbed me in the side of my foot and I literally moaned out loud.  I’ll be so glad to be done with PA tomorrow!  
I met one more SOBO.  His name is  Colorado.  Also a very nice guy. He let us know that New Jersey has its fair share of rocks too....UGH! 
With only a couple of miles to go, I had gotten pretty far ahead.  A painted rock by a tree grabbed attention.  I’ve seen a few of these on the trail and usually hike past, but for some reason I decided to take a closer look this time.  It was pink and blue and written on it were the words “Harry Potter”.   This is just crazy!  Yesterday I was calling my stick the Harry Potter wand. The universe is listening to me. I put that rock in my pocket.  
It was a great day!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601061,"I was super happy to see fairly decent terrain this morning!  Hugs took the lead. I followed close behind listening to her talk to a bird.  She ALWAYS greets the animals....it’s one of my favorite things about her!  
I followed her through an opening with a view, and then another one shortly after that.  It was nice having great views on our last day in Pennsylvania. 
I walked ahead after the second view. My pace is usually just a little faster than Hugs pace...not always though. While I was ahead I decided to take the Vista Blue Blaze. I’m glad I did.  There I could see a river, maybe Lehigh, but possibly the Delaware. Either way it made for a great photo and a nice goodbye.  
Hugs caught up to me while I was chatting with a mom and son having lunch on the trail. She was listening to her AWOL audio book so I fell in place behind her listening too. It was about Maine and since we’re going there soon I wanted to hear everything. That’s how we ended up off trail.  A good distance off trail!   Glad we have Guthook’s! 
Once we were back on trail we ran into a trail volunteer. At least that’s what he said he was. Then he went on to tell us that he’s an author.  He showed us a picture of his first book and said the second book was written based on hiker interviews. I think he said it’s called Quality of Life.   Anyway his name is Joseph Ciaccio if you want to check it out.  
When we came down out of the park we were on a road to a little town.  There was Zoe’s Ice cream shop.  They also happen to serve lunch.  I had a tuna melt with an old fashioned cherry cola they make themselves. It reminded me of Swans, a place I went to as a child. I drank many cherry cokes there! 
I looked at my guestbook during lunch. There are no words. I am just so grateful for everyone’s encouragement, support, and advice.  There are many times when I’ve hiked on because of you.  Most of you are complete strangers.  My faith in humanity is greater now then ever before.  
After lunch we walked through town and across the Delaware River.  Halfway across I did the happy dance...because I’m in NEW JERSEY!  Yes yes yes!  
Very quickly I ran into two hikers with a dog.  Their dog of course grabbed my attention.  As conversation flowed it turns out they’re nurses too and one is an RNP like Hugs.  They thru-hiked last year and were a wealth of information!   Thank you so much to Torque and Glampress for all of the great advice!   
As if crossing into a new state and getting priceless information about Maine wasn’t enough, I also reached 1300 miles today!  It might be at sloth pace, but I’m getting there!  
The trail took us almost completely around a small lake today.  I saw a water snake there. It’s the first water snake I’ve seen on the hike so far.  
We passed a group of kids having a birthday party at the lake. They offered us some birthday cake.  We were still full from lunch, but I thought that was really nice of them.  
Leaving the lake area the trail became narrow with tall bushes on both sides. It had been sprinkling off and on so the leaves were wet. Every time my shoulders touched a bush it felt like I was being rained on. I came out of there pretty wet! 
The next thing I know, I’m ridge hiking!  I love love love ridge hiking. New Jersey does not disappoint.  Today’s views were amazing!  I had lots of them for long periods of time.  
Coming down off the ridge was a little rocky.  Nothing like PA, but notable.  I reached the road, and there was Papa Big Swig. Another awesome day in the books!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601160,"My back and hip just would not allow me to sleep last night.  I was exhausted from my first step on the trail. Hugs realized she had left her glasses at the camper with her first step...rough start today.  
The trail started UP.  It wasn’t a  bad UP, but last nights rain left the rocks slippery, so we had to be very aware of every step.  I’m happy to announce that nobody fell today!  
Once I reached the summit my ridge hiking day began.  It’s official, I’m in love with New Jersey!  I had amazing views all day long!   I have missed this kind of hiking.  
Somewhere along the way I lost the top cap to my Mophie.  For those of you who don’t know, a Mophie is an external charging device for cell phones.  Papa Big Swig bought mine specifically for my hike.  Mophie is honoring a 2 year warranty and replacing it!   We’re paying $15 for express shipping, and I have no complaints about that.   
Shortly after discovering my broken Mophie I came to a field of Dasies.  It was a bright surprise!  My path went right through them. At first it was so pleasant.  The sun was shining bright right there, and they were so pretty.  However, as I proceeded down my path the daisies grew taller. They stretched across the trail becoming entangled with each other.  Soon they were over my head and I found myself bushwhacking my way through daisies!  
I had my eyes opened for bears. I’ve heard  New Jersey has lots of them, but my only wildlife experience today was a turtle.  He was scooting along pretty quickly for a turtle.  I sent the kids a video and said a turtle was racing me to Katahdin.   One asked if he was winning!?! I had a little laugh before I left that turtle eating my dust!   lol 
I’m not sure if it was lack of sleep or the heat, but I had a headache most of the day. There was a little mountain climbing and my head just pulsated with every step.  The sun was directly on me during that time too.  Once the sun went down my headache improved. 
I hiked past several areas of standing water.  I read there’s a beaver issue around there.  I’m so amazed by Beavers. They REALLY know how to build!  
Just coming up and away from all the water I met Mosey. He is a SOBO section hiker from New Jersey.  He was Yo-ing to scare away bears. I had not seen a single one.  He admitted he hadn’t either.  Then he told me NJ has a bear hunt every other year.  His words were “maybe they finally got rid of them”.  How sad.  If he feels that way he shouldn’t be out here. 
Hugs caught up during my conversation with Mosey, so I said goodbye and continued into a nice pine forest. Like always my joints enjoyed the pine needle carpet cushioning every step 
Coming down I crossed paths with two SOBO thru-hikers.  They started June 13.  I have to be at work October 24th.  I think I can do it!   That means missing my Keith Urban concert October 12.   We’ll see how it all plays out.   
We were at our extraction point before Papa Big Swig arrived.  It was a short wait. As soon as I sat and my body into the SUV my back began to spasm.   I’m getting concerned. I’ll be seeing the chiropractor again in the morning.

I was in slow motion this morning. Besides running late for the chiropractor, I didn’t get breakfast before I saw him either.   When we went back to the camper to pick up Hugs, I grabbed leftover Spaghetti.  Yes, I had Spaghetti for breakfast!  In the SUV no less.  
We did a SOBO flip flop today.  Our hike actually started in a tiny part of New York. It’s sandwiched between two parts of New Jersey. I’m not REALLY in New York just yet.  I will be there on Saturday if tomorrow goes as I hope.  
The trail started out muddy.  I mean MUDDY!  Hugs wears trail runners and in the first 5 minutes she had mud literally between her toes!  It went right through her shoes.  
I took the lead early and somehow managed to aggravate a squirrel right away.  He ran up a tree letting me have it the whole way. He was chattering and wagging his tail.  I have no idea what I did.  
There are still rocks in New Jersey and at times they’re plentiful, but there’s definitely a lot more good trail than bad.  During a good trail time I looked up just in time to see a very large doe leap into the woods from the trail.  There are few animals more graceful than a deer.   I’m in awe every time. 
Because my back has been annoying me, I walked slowly today. Hugs and I also took an extended lunch break.  There was a shelter right on trail with a large beautiful open space in front of it.  We both enjoyed the blue skies and sunshine as long as we could.  
Eventually we had to go back under the canopy and continue our journey.  We did a lot of ridge hiking today with more wonderful views.  
As we were on some rocks near an overlook on my left, I happen to look down to my right.  There was a huge ant pile.  It was twice as big as a basketball!  Red ants were rushing around all over it.  I haven’t seen a red ant on the trail in months.   I see lots of black ones, but no red ones.  
We ended up crossing paths with a group of three thru-hikers going northbound.  Obvious new college grads. They started June 3rd!!! Again I’m a bit embarrassed.  
Right past them I saw a man in the distance taking a break.  When I got close he turned and looked at me.  It was Trail Walker!  We haven’t seen him since the Shenandoahs.  It was good to see he’s still plugging away at it.  
We had fairly good terrain going up Sunrise Mountain.  There was a nice pavilion at the top which is 1653ft.   The views were great.  It would have been a lovely lunch spot too, but we lunched already. 
From their the trail took us by a fire tower.  The views without the tower were fantastic, but Hugs went up anyway. She said it multiplied in splendor up there.  I was afraid to over tax my back.  
From the fire tower it was pretty much down and out to the parking area where Papa Big Swig waited.  There was one last view us as we went down.  New Jersey continues to impress me.  It’s a great state to hike in!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601381,"I saw my chiropractor for the last time this morning. We headed to the trail from his office. On the way there we passed a harness horse farm. I wanted to stop and chat but time wouldn’t allow. As a young adult I trained and raced harness horses. I loved it, and I really miss owning a horse.  
Just as we hopped out of the vehicle at High Point State Park to start hiking north, a SOBO came across the field towards us.  I never caught her name, but it makes me happy to see strong women out here enjoying the trail.  I feel confident that Grandma Gatewood is smiling down on us!  
Today’s hike started out going UP.  We went up 1692.3 feet to an observation deck.  The views were great!  Leaving the deck we went down a hill and found ourselves on a road. Hmmm that’s always fishy. Very quickly we looked at Guthook’s and did a U-Turn.  Right back up that hill...ugh!  
The next few miles were spent weaving through pastures, fields, and woods.  It was nice. There was sunshine and blue skies.  There were orange butterflies bouncing from purple clover to purple clover.  I thought of my horses again. They love purple clover!  
There was a marshy area with boardwalks for the hikers.  I’m so grateful to the volunteers who maintain all of this for us.  
Eventually we popped out on the road to Unionville NY.  It was past lunchtime and we were hungry so we walked 0.3 miles to Wits End Bar. Both of us had wings and a salad for lunch.  Thinking we were ahead of schedule we decided to enjoy an adult beverage after lunch. This bar was really nice. It felt like being at Cheers where everybody knows your name. Great food, friendly owner and staff!  A nice stop. 
Once we got back to the trail I realized the mileage from the bar was different.  We thought we only had 8 miles left to go but it was 11.8 trail miles! Good grief!  I should have known 8 miles wasn’t correct. 
By now it was after 3pm so we already knew we would be night hiking.  The terrain was nice though. Other than copious amounts of mosquitoes it couldn’t get better.  We were walking beside the woods in another field chatting about grandkids when Hugs said she hadn’t seen a blaze in a while. Immediately we checked Guthook’s. I can’t believe it, off trail again!  Another U-Turn...Double Ugh!  
There were more boardwalks, streams and fields until we came to a large rock scramble going UP.  I think it was a 1000ft climb.  But on our way to the rock scramble we got off trail again!  This can’t be real!?! We already had a 20 mile day planned!  U-Turn AGAIN!!!! Triple Ugh! 
The AWOL guy said Jersey is the worst for poorly marked turns etc. I agree!  But I love the trail here! 
Anyway, I made it to the scrambles and climbed up to Rocky Outcrop at 1080 Ft elevation. That view! You just can’t beat the Jersey views!  This would be the last big climb of the day.  
Then we came to a park with a couple miles of boardwalk over marshy land. It was beautiful!  The cattails were high, bullfrogs were croaking, and locals were strolling.  The sun was fading fast by then and the mosquitoes were a force to be reckoned with, but wow it was a great place to be!  
Just as the sun completely fell out of the sky our boardwalk came to an end. We had 1.5 miles left to go. I already had my headlamp on.  We were back in the woods and my light attracted even more bugs! I was scared to take a deep breath.  They were already flying up my nose. I didn’t want them in my mouth too! 
Eventually we came to a swampy cow pasture.  Thank goodness there was more boardwalk! It’s a full moon tonight, and that was nice when hiking through the pasture. Finally we crossed the fence to a road and parking lot where Papa Big Swig would pick us up.  In 10 minuets our chariot arrived.  
We are both wiped out, but this day was great!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601456,"Papa Big Swig took us to where we stopped yesterday.  Walking up to our first mountain of the day was a bit surreal. It was an open field with a path to a huge multi-green colored mountain.  I was awestruck by the grandeur of the mountain. 
Then reality hit.  I was going up. Way up! Over rock scrambles for a long time. It was work! There was a spring flowing under the rocks. I did enjoy listening to the sound of rushing water as I climbed up 1042ft to the “view”.  Once we made the climb we learned the actual vista was 0.8 miles off trail. Hugs and I decided to check it out. If I had it to do over again I would chose not to go. But we met some nice people up there, and that made it worthwhile.  
We struck up conversations with Dave.  He’s a music instructor at a college in NY and he’s a published author. His latest book is about Johann Sebastian Bach.  He hiked a while with Hugs, then he and I got ahead for a few miles. We talked about politics, government, hiking, and work.  I really enjoyed our discussion!  We finally reached a road where I waited for Hugs, and he turned back towards his car.  He had walked an extra 2.5 miles with me.  It was a slice of life I’ll remember for a long time.  
Hugs caught up just as Dave was leaving.  Turns out her brother who is in music education knew Dave.  What a small world!  
Hugs and I began hiking DOWN from the road. Soon we were back in wet swampy areas.  The mosquitoes were rampant!  We both sprayed with Picaradin again.  And one more time I was thankful for the boardwalks that kept us out of the ankle deep mud.  
I came up out of the bog to another road.  Just as I did a SOBO popped out from the other direction.  I explained that Hugs and I are pretty much the NOBO caboose.  He claimed his fame as the SOBO caboose.  I had to laugh!  
From there the trail went up.  There was a good amount of rock climbing, but it was dry at least. Eventually we got real trail!   I was ahead a few yards so my conversation with Hugs was almost at shouting range. I was completely surprised to look about 20 ft off trail to see a buck resting in the grass.   He laid there and allowed me to take photos.  Then he gave Hugs the same courtesy. 
Soon we were back on boulders.  I was a bit ahead and really enjoyed the silence up there alone.  I could smell the pines and just felt renewed.  Then it happened way up there... I crossed the border into New York! It’s official!
I waited for Hugs to arrive so we could have our usual photo session.  We took a moment to let our latest accomplishment sink in.  More and more it feels like we can REALLY do this! 
I left out first from the border crossing. I’ve always loved New York, not only NYC but the whole state.  So I was just proud, humbled, and touched when I crossed a few more boulders on this mountain top to find Ole Glory waiving way up there!   NEW YORK STRONG! 
The next several miles was ridge hiking. It was physically challenging climbing hand over fist many times  up over large boulders and rock scrambles.  But the views were priceless!  
I was hiking up there lost in my own thoughts.  It crossed my mind that I had completed New Jersey without seeing a single bear. I’m a little sad about that.  I haven’t seen a bear since Virginia.   
I received a video from my youngest granddaughter begging me to bring her to New York. At the time I was hiking down to a beautiful stream with some falls.  I videotaped it for her and sent that back.  Hugs arrived so I was telling her what Lucie had done while I was crossing the stream.  I must have been distracted.  One slippery step on a wet rock and I began to fight the fall.  Very controlled and slowly I fell forward then onto my elbows and knees. Yep, down went McGinney.  Hugs said the whole slow motion thing was painful to watch.  I didn’t really get hurt, but the jolt sent my back into spasms.  It’s extra sensitive right now.  
I had to pull myself together quickly because the journey was heading UP. This time it was up the side of a mountain with limited footing or grasps.  There was re-bar placed like a ladder in the rock for us.  This is the second time I’ve seen that. First at Dragons Tooth and now here.  
We stayed up high on the ridges and rocks with plenty more climbs for a few miles.  Then we came to a blue blaze taking us down to Greenwood Lake NY.  Papa Big Swig was there waiting for us.  The camper was hooked up and everything loaded...including the dogs.  
We’re on our way to Katahdin!  The day to flip has arrived. 
We drove about 4 hours tonight and will finish the drive tomorrow.  We’re sleeping in a hotel.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601556,"We slept last night at a hotel in Sturbridge Massachusetts.  This was a strategic stop.  There’s an REI not far from the hotel and we had plans for this morning. 
Before going shopping we ate breakfast at a local favorite.  Annie’s Country Kitchen served up some great corned-beef hash with over easy eggs and toast.  My belly was happy!  
Papa Big Swig found out this REI will change the loops on my poles. So that was top priority!  I also returned some sandals, and had something I ordered online delivered there.  And I needed one more pair of hiking pants. It’s cooler here. 
It turned out the guy who was suppose to manage my loops wasn’t there. He also failed to put out the supplies for anybody else.  The manager gave me a whole new set of Black Diamond trekking poles. for $8.00. The cost of the loops only! I’m happy!  
It was about a 5 hours drive to Millinocket Maine. Papa Big Swig was driving so Hugs and I napped. We put in well over 100 miles this past week to get to New York for the flip up to Maine.  We’re exhausted!  
Sadly, I slept the whole way through Vermont...
Our first stop in Maine was Kennebunkport.  I had a Lobster Roll for lunch!  The best $23 I’ve ever spent!   
 I’m already in love with Maine!  From the natural beauty to the fresh woodsy smells. I love it all!!  
So for tonight all three of us are at the Katahdin Inn. We met twin brothers at the hotel. Frick & Frack plan to summit Katahdin tomorrow.  I’m so excited for them, and can’t wait until it’s our turn!   
For now it’s laundry, getting our big packs ready, and resting our bodies as much as possible. 
Papa Big Swig leaves in the morning. Hugs and I will be working with a shuttle driver to get us where we need to go tomorrow.

Our shuttle driver Lloyd was here at 9:45 this morning to help us get ready for our big day. He drove us to Baxter State Park where we learned a lot!  
The first obstacle is finding sleeping arrangements for when we come down the south side of Katahdin.  My original plans were to tent with a friend who happens to be here at the same time. However, her tentsite is on the north side of Mt Katahdin.  We are not hiking 30 miles back around to get there.  We tried to rent a site on the south side, but they’re full.  In the end we accepted the expense of the A.T. Lodge for one night.  
So it’s official, we are registered and permitted to summit Mt Katahdin tomorrow!!!  5,269ft elevation!  This is absolutely mountain climbing, not hiking. Our big packs will be left at the ranger station or the Lodge. Park Rangers lend out daypacks to summit Katahdin with. I REALLY cannot wait!   The shuttle driver said to anticipate about 10 hours of hiking to get up, over, and down the mountain.  We’ll see how Hugs and Blue Raccoon do at our standard sloth pace.  
On the way out Lloyd took us to a shop at the park. It has a little bit of everything.  Souvenirs, ATM, and food. We both got another Lobster Roll!  Can’t get enough of that stuff!  
Right now I’m permethrin treating my clothing and gear in preparation for several days in the wilderness.  This wards off ticks and mosquitoes. 
We are only carrying half of our food.  Lloyd will be hanging the other half for us in a tree at the halfway point in the wilderness. There’s an old logging road he’s using to get up there. This man is a gift from God!  We have Papa Big Swig to thank for that. He’s the one who found him for us. 
I understand there may be several days with no cell service. I’ll post my journal when I can.  Say a prayer for me and Hugs, this is a BIG deal in the hiking world!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601748,"Last night Lloyd called and said he had a shuttle customer who was giving up her lean-to for tonight.  He paid for it right then and put it in my name.  He knew we would prefer to stay in the park if possible.  We were very happy he was able to get it...and grateful!!  We both slept better last night with a rock solid plan for today.  
Lloyd picked us up at 5:45 this morning.  My things were ready to go, and Hugs was tying up loose ends.  Before 6am we were all loaded up and on our way to Baxter State Park. Even that early in the morning the entrance line was a half mile long. Lloyd had warned us of this.  
He dropped us off by a bridge that leads to the Park Rangers Station. At the Ranger Station we turned in our lean-to paper and prepared to begin the summit of Mt Katahdin 5267ft elevation.  I used a borrowed day pack. Hugs took her own pack but left most of the contents in a bag at the station. It was 7:30am when all prep business was done, and we were off....
Just as we stepped foot onto the approach trail it began to lightly sprinkle.  Sprinkles at the bottom usually means rain at the top. We’ll see.  
I started out in the lead, though we stayed pretty close together. The ascent began immediately with a beautiful trail. The sprinkles stopped leaving cloud coverage and fog. Katahdin Stream ran right beside it for a good while. The stream was swift with a few small falls.  The sound of it was music to my ears.   
The forest is mostly pines.  Very tall fragrant pines! There were mostly rocks and boulders, but occasionally I would get a soft carpet of pine needles. 
I came to a wooden footbridge that crossed Katahdin Stream, and I took a deep breath. The air was a few degrees cooler. It was so refreshing! This is the first time I could see into the stream.  This water is crystal clear.  The rocks on the bottom were various shades of white, brown, and gray. They were all smooth and rounded.  I could have walked barefoot in that stream for hours if I didn’t have a mountain to climb. 
My mind immediately went to dad. This was his kind of place. I could feel his presence, and I knew we were taking this hike together. This was going to be a long day and it was a comforting feeling. 
I got ahead of Hugs a good distance and chose to walk quietly. I listened to the birds chirp, and the breezes blow through the trees.  It started getting difficult after the first mile so there was my occasional grunt while pulling myself up and over car sized boulders. Slow and steady I told myself.  At least these rocks were round and smooth, not those jagged ones that stab you, like in Pennsylvania.  
It was at the start of the second mile when I began to sweat.  That’s about the time I noticed how disgusting my borrowed daypack smelled!  Who knows how many other hikers have sweat in this nasty pack!  I could barely stand it!  I should have done what Hugs did.  It smelled the rest of the day! 
The sprinkles had quit long ago, but there was a steady trickle of water coming down the trail.   It must have rained heavier up there.  I had to be careful. Wet rocks can be disastrous, and the trail by now was pretty much straight up. I was now tossing my trekking poles up then climbing up myself. Still no need to drop pack since I had the stinky little loaner daypack.  Even though I was carrying 3 liters of water I was still able to pull myself up using tree limbs and finding footing on the boulders. I was at slothier pace but making my way.  I said out loud “ this is for you dad”!   He was in my heart the whole day.  
I was coming up to the tree line and the winds were getting strong.  Nothing there to block it. I’m not sure, but I’m guessing I was about 2.5 miles up.  
Hugs had asked that I wait every mile or so for her, so before I was completely out of tree coverage I stopped.  When she arrived she asked for help securing her trekking poles on her pack.  I asked for the same.  Poles were obsolete at this point.  As I was helping her I noticed her elbow was skinned up and bleeding. Hugs had fallen.   I was too far ahead and wasn’t there to help her.  I won’t let that happen again. We’ve got to be a team on this climb.  
From that moment on we stayed together.  We switched off leading finding handholds and footholds.  It was the most physically challenging climb I’ve ever done in my life.  Hugs said this is technically the most challenging climb she’s ever done.  Hugs is not a big person. Many times grasps were just too far to reach. I helped push her up from behind or pull her up from the front many times.  It was scary!  One slip and in many spots it would have been certain death.   The wind gusts were strong!  Sometimes strong enough to blow you over if you weren’t hanging on.  
We had been climbing over 3 hours and both of us were hungry.  We knew by looking at our Guthook’s app there were some flat rocks coming up.  We had a couple more big maneuvers to get there.  I took the lead, and for the first time I had to drop pack and toss it up ahead of me. Just as I started to figure out my hand grasps I noticed fresh blood on the rock.  Another hiker had left a piece of themselves on Katahdin.  
I injured my left leg getting up there. Just a scrape and a bruise, but I made it. I was able to hang on to some boulders and extend my foot back down to Hugs who used it to climb up.  We both made it!  
Lunch time!   We weren’t even at the true “flat rock” place, but it was good enough. While we were eating a father son section-hiker duo arrived. They lunched too. Nice people from NY.  Dad is an attorney and Max is in High School.  During lunch I noticed my bandana was missing.  The others had seen it but didn’t pick it up( don’t blame them). I’m sure bloody rock had claimed my bandana.   
We started going UP again.  It wasn’t long before Hugs’ left shin was bloody from top to bottom. We had matching shins!  Though hers was worse by far. Our bodies seriously ached in places we didn’t know exist.  This is hard! 
The rest of the way up there were zero trees to help block the wind.  I put my hat in my pack.  I’m guessing 40 MPH gusts,  maybe more.  The clouds and fog limited our view.  It was a white abyss as we continued to fight the misty winds and Katahdin.   
We came to a climb I couldn’t figure out.  I was thinking to myself “ this is brutal”.  It was brutal, but it was also rewarding, humbling, spiritual, and so much more. I was determined.  
I made my around to a wet slanted boulder, and that’s where I went wrong.   I went down hard!  I was certain my right hip or femur was broken. I could not move.  The pain was through the roof.  Hugs came immediately to help me and we cried. I did not want to go out like that!  After 10 minutes or so I was able to move my leg with my hands.  My left foot was wedged under another boulder, I had to get that out. Slowly but surely I pulled myself to a sitting position. It took a while but I was able to stand and bear some weight on my leg.  Maybe I’m not broken?   Badly bent, but not broken.  I forced myself to keep going.  In time I realized it’s probably a bone bruise and muscular.  I still had to lift it with my hands.  But I climbed.  
There was a flat false summit that gave us a reprieve for about a mile on our way to the very top. We had to pick our way through, over, and around small to medium sized rocks but no climbing. Our biggest challenge was the misty wind.  Followed closely by the fog and clouds.  
Finally we could see the sign!  We were beaten up and bruised, but we were going to make it!  And the sun started peeking through!   Thank you Jesus!!  
We touched the sign at 1:50pm. It had taken 6 hours and 20 minutes to summit Katahdin. Surreal!
Others were up there. A couple of NOBO thru-hikers, a new world record holder.   Karel(pronounced Carl)Sabbe from Belgium.  He summited before us completing the trail in 41days 7.5 hours. Wow!  But his record does not take away from the half dozen  NOBO’s who completed their journey today.  I watched a grown man touch the sign and fall to tears.  I hugged him from the side and said congrats.  
I’ve always felt that dad sends me birds. After he passed we planted a tree in honor of him (his request) and immediately a blueJay built a nest.  Poor mom was dive bombed a few times by that mama bluejay when she was watering dad’s tree.   That’s just one example of the many times in my moments of need, when a bird has arrived. Today was no different. The biggest fattest crow flew to the top of Katahdin today.   He stayed around until I was ready to start down.  When my son was younger playing baseball my dad would let out a “caw-caw” to let Kyle know he was there.  It was their special thing.  Not surprised to see a crow today. 
We took our photos at the sign through gail force winds, gave our best to the others and started down.  It was 2:40pm. Just then the clouds rolled away, the fog lifted, the winds slowed and the sun shone!  We had views!   Beautiful amazing views!  
We had come up via the Hunt Trail which is the official A.T. trail.  There is a shorter trail going down called the Abol Slide Trail. It will save us a mile and we needed to be off the mountain by sunset at 7:10pm. We were pushing the limits. 
Abol Slide is steeper than Hunt and it’s named for its rock slides.  I still felt it was our best option with limited time. The climb down was scary! Three hours of scary! We had to do a lot of climbing down. Sometimes we could stay upright and carefully walk, but the rocks below our feet were loose and we caught ourselves many times.  Until one time I didn’t. No serious damage, just a small cut on my wrist.  My leg on the other hand could have lived without the fall.  Every step after I injured my leg was painful. It’s still in pain right now.  
The last 1.5 miles of Abol Became a real trail.  Thank goodness it did, because the clouds came back and rain poured down. If we had been on those rocks during the rain we would have been stuck on Katahdin overnight. 
We stepped onto the road around 7:15pm, and hitched a ride with the ranger back to camp 2 miles away.  What a day! 
Battered and bruised but not broken. I’d do it all over again. What a gift this day was!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601810,"After we ate our dinner in the dark last night we decided our bodies need a break. Katahdin did a number on us. Checkout time for our lean-to is 11am...we’re using it all! 
I slept poorly.  Primarily because I was unable to lay on my right side at all.  That leg just won’t let me do it.  Also, we had a noisy critter under our lean-to.  It woke me up twice, and Hugs once.  
I was afraid I may not even be able to walk this morning, but I could. Hurts like nobodies business, but I’m walking.  I was out of my sleeping bag by 7:00 for a privy break. I journaled a little, and laid back down. Sleep took over for a few more minutes. It was nice.  
Last night my eyes were burning.  I blamed it on the wind and blowing sandy dirt from yesterday. I wear contact lenses so I took them out. I thought the problem could also be from smoke irritation. My fire starting attempt ended in lots of smoke and no fire.  This morning my contacts just didn’t feel right in my eyes again. I flushed them with saline, put my contacts in, and went on about my day.  
I made attempt #2 on the fire without success. Rinsed my stinky clothing from yesterday in the stream(no soap), and started organizing.  I had a late breakfast of PBJ, cheese, and an apple.  I’m calling it brunch!  
At 12:30 we were finally ready to leave the campsite.  Our hike was planned for 13 miles...southbound!  That means we should be at camp no later than 6:30pm. 
It feels so strange to be a SOBO now.  It’s also a little difficult managing my Guthook app. I purchased it in NOBO format. 
Trail terrain was nice this morning.  The forest is mostly pine. There were some rocks and roots but otherwise my favorite carpet of pine needles.   
We met several NOBO’s coming in to finish their hike.  We congratulated each of them as we passed. Many stopped to share their trail experiences. We told them about Katahdin, and they told us what lies ahead on our flip. Papa Smurf has hiked Katahdin before, he didn’t need our helpful hints. His words to us were that there are harder mountains than Katahdin in our near future. YIKES! The clock was ticking, but I didn’t care. It was so nice chatting with everybody. Despite my eyes being on fire the whole time. 
The trail went down into a wet boggy area for a bit. The state of Maine took good care of us though. We had logs or boards to walk on. No wet boots!  For now anyway.  
The trail took us past two water falls. Little Falls and Big Falls. We took some photos at little falls and moved on quickly.  By the time we hit Big Falls we were hungry, so we decided to take a snack break there. Before you know it we were in the water! I can neither confirm nor deny if a skinny dip occurred, but I will say the cool water felt so good on my injured right leg.  
It was there when Hugs noticed green goo coming out my eyes.  I removed my contacts right then and flushed my eyes with saline again.  It burned. Ugh!  This is an infection!  Hugs is a provider so getting proper eye drops ordered will not be a problem. The problem is getting to a pharmacy.  
With my glasses in place we hiked on through the woods up and over the stream on top of boulders. In little time the rapid stream had become a gently flowing river. So peaceful . 
As we hiked away from the river thunder could be heard in the distance. Before long it was pouring rain. My eyes were on fire and with our little swim we were way behind on time. Abol store was 0.8 miles ahead.  We stopped and called the shuttle driver, Lloyd.  He was my angel!  Back to Katahdin Inn we went.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601860,"I woke up this morning at the Katahdin Inn.  It is located right next door to a Rite Aid where I will be picking up my antibiotic eye drops.  
Here I am about 36 hours post Katahdin and I’ve got an eye infection, my legs look and feel like I was run over by a pick-up truck, and the rest of me aches. I slept with ice packs last night. ... when I slept.   
I made arrangements for a 9:45am shuttle pick up.   I needed every minute of it. By the time we got to the trail it was 10:45.  Another late start.   
Armed with my antibiotic eye drops and a full pack I set out in the 100 mile wilderness! How exciting! I saw 5 or 6 NOBO’s coming in to finish their hike.  They’re always extremely verbose.  I’m sure it’s the excitement of reaching Katahdin and the prospect of really finishing this long crazy hike!  I smile and talk as long as they want. It’s fun to share in others joy! 
There were excessive roots on the trail today, and it stormed last night.  Rain and roots are a recipe for disaster.  I chose stepping on roots roots to avoid stepping in mud, and sure enough, down went McGinney!  I just laid there. My leg won’t take much more of this. 
This leg injury has slowed me down tremendously.  Hugs was in the lead most of the day. I’m going to have to start earlier and hike longer for a while.  Hopefully it will heal up quickly.  My biggest fear is that my body won’t hold up to let me finish. 
Being forced to hike slowly was nice in some ways. I really smelled the pines.  I felt all of the breezes.  I heard all the little sounds a forest makes, and I saw the hundreds of tiny pine cones scattered along the trail.  It struck me that Maine has the most beautiful forests I’ve seen so far.  Slow is good.  
When I finally reached the summit of today’s biggest climb, I caught up to Hugs. There she was leaning on a rock enjoying cell service.  I pulled up a rock and did the same.  
I miss Papa Big Swig. He was my first and only text.  We chatted a short while.  I felt the need to move on since I’m so slow.  Too give you an idea of how slow I am, Hugs stayed up there an hour trying to post something and still passed me before I made it to the shelter.  At times I’m still using my hands to lift my right leg, depending how high up I need to step.  
The trail down from the rocks was nice. It took me down to Beaver Pond.  Beaver Pond is a very large pond. I would call it a lake.  The breezes were making waves today. MI got to listen to the water splash on rocks for miles.  
It was near Beaver Pond where I met a couple who flipped from Harpers Ferry.  They came in at the Wilderness, so they’re going NOBO to Katahdin before the real flip occurs.  It felt nice to know that I’m not actually in last place.  
Today’s natural wonder for me were a series of brilliant white mushrooms. They were in various stages of growth, but in the end they opened up like a beautifully scalloped birdbath.   Otherwise I saw toads, frogs, birds, and fat red squirrels.   
The terrain remained kind as I hiked until dusk.   Hugs and I carefully walked on 3 logs across Rainbow Creek to our shelter for tonight. 
Supper in the dark again.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601951,"I slept great last night!  The air was cool but I was snug as a bug in my Nemo sleeping bag. 
I had coffee cooking by 7:15 this morning.  I also had every intention of leaving the shelter by 8:00. However, very excited NOBO’s started hiking by and I found myself chatting with all of them.  They’re beaming with joy!  It was after 10am before Hugs and I took a single step.  
My path ran right beside Rainbow Creek for a long time.  It’s a swift little creek with lots of small falls.  There was a thin section of pines between the trail and creek, and the sun was positioned just right to shine between the trees. My path was warmed making it even more  lovely. 
I watched a toad hop its way across the path in the sunshine. He hid in a small pile of fallen leaves.  There are no daddy longlegs here, and the mosquitoes are significantly less.  I’m not sure what those little guys eat up here, but I sure don’t miss those spiders and skeeters! 
The creek stayed with the trail a long while. It twisted and turned with me as I walked until I came out onto an old logging road.  I walked the road a couple hundred feet to a wooden bridge and across the creek.  The sun shone brightly on that bridge so I just stood there. I was soaking it up while listening to the water rush under. About that time another happy NOBO came along. She looked at me and said “don’t you just love sun puddles?”  If that was a sun puddle, yes I do!  
Shortly after the bridge I made a turn into the woods again.  The trail became a trail of roots!  I’ve never had so many tree roots for such a long distance on this trail before. Hugs caught up to me in the roots. 
She had a message on her satellite phone for me. It was from Papa Big Swig, and I knew that couldn’t be good.  I was right. It turns out my little cousin is ill.  She was a happy healthy college kid when I left. Please say a prayer for Aubrey. My heart is aching for her right now. 
I walked on alone and had a cry in the woods. I’ll never understand some things. I just keep my faith that one day I will understand it all. God and I had a bonding moment out there. That’s always nice.  
A pheasant came to visit me right then...
I waited for Hugs, and after some indecisiveness we decided to pitch our tents on the beach of this lovely lake tonight.  Nahmakanta Lake shore. After rinsing off in the lake , we built a beautiful fire on the beach and enjoyed our dinner right there.  
I’m sleeping with my rain fly open tonight. Hoping to catch moose drinking from the waters edge in the morning.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601973,"Woke up at 7am again. The outside of my tent was soaked. It did not rain, so that’s how heavy the mountain dew was last night. My shorts and sports bra I rinsed in the lake and hung on branches to dry overnight are MORE wet now than when I went to sleep.   
It was after 10:30am again before we left camp.  It just took that long to dry out our tents enough to pack them up. 
I rebuilt the fire this morning though, and that was nice.  Coffee by a fire is always good. 
The first NOBO I met up with was Grey Squirrel.  I’ve seen plenty of grey squirrels before, but I bet he’s never seen a Blue Raccoon! Haha!  He was on the grumpy side.  The fist NOBO thru-hiker I’ve met in such bad spirits.  Anyway, as he was complaining a little red squirrel came running by with a very large nut in its mouth. The nut was so big that it was funny!  I took a second to wish Grey Squirrel well and left while the red squirrel still had me smiling. Hugs left with me, still giggling about that huge nut.  
We came across a big ole pile of moose poop! Our eyes were open the rest of the day. No luck. I know they’re out here somewhere. 
Then we came across more of those amazing tree roots that grow themselves across huge boulders to find soil on the other side.  That’s a phenomenon if you ask me.  
Soon I came to a Blue Blaze it went to a view of Katahdin.  There were some boulders on a lake with a perfect view from 40 miles away. That’s today’s photo.  
From there to the campsite was pretty uneventful.  I stayed on moose alert and listened to water planes come and go.  The Maine forest is just amazing to me.  I’m never bored.  
Antlers Campsite is pretty awesome.  Lots of tent room, a privy not far away, and another big beautiful lake!  There are about 7 other tents here. We’re so used to being alone, it’s a nice change of pace. 
Red Hawk and Cribbage are some younger thru-hikers from California. I’m pretty sure they’re a couple since they use names like Babe and sweety for each other. Red Hawk went fishing in the lake with good success!  He threw 3 fish wrapped in aluminum foil with seasoning on them right in the fire.  About 20 minutes later I tasted some of the best fish I’ve ever eaten! 
Another great day here in Maine!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602122,"I woke up with the sun this morning. This is the first morning with absolutely no crud in my eyes. One more day of eye drops and I should be good. 
Sunrise on the lake was beautiful! Still no moose, but looking around I saw at least 2 more tents had arrived in the night.  I’d bet it’s NOBO’s looking forward to Katahdin.  Their excitement spills out with every conversation! I’m so glad that I get to be a part of their joy! 
Red Hawk and Cribbage were up early too.  I made myself some oatmeal and watched them hurry to get on the trail. Red Hawk was my trail angel again today.  He gave me his extra TP to get me through the wilderness.  I was worried I may not have enough.  In exchange I gave him a couple of snacks. They were out of camp in a blink. I wish them the best!  
Hugs lost a tent stake the night we camped on the beach.  I looked down, and out of nowhere there was a tent stake. I handed it to her inside her tent, and looked down again to find a penny.  Yep, it was heads up!   I put that little gem in my pocket.  
We hit the trail.  The terrain has been mostly pine straw with a few rocks, creeks, and boulders.   Occasionally I would get a nice strong scent of pine. The pines here are awesome! About 2am this morning I stepped out of my tent to potty and looked straight up through the pines.  Wow!  The stars were so brilliant!  I wish I had taken a picture.  
Exactly 2.2 miles down the trail Hugs realized she had left her hat at camp. She toyed with the idea of going back after it before deciding to carry on.  I felt bad because just bought it and she loves that hat.  
Around that same time some NOBO’s gave us word of trail magic at Jo Mary road.  We had 1.6 miles to go.....please have soda!   Please don’t leave!   
Other than a brief stop to photo a baby snake I was in high speed sloth mode!  Then there it was TRAIL MAGIC!!! Oh happy dance!! Happy dance!!  
Ginger Ale?  Well yes! Two of them!  Zebra cake?  Yes again!  Two of those as well!   Sure I’ll take some chips and that big fat blow pop...grape flavored please and thanks. What a treat!  
Our Angel is trail named Baguette. She was a thru-hiker last year with her mom.  That alone is an awesome story! Lifetime memories were made right there.  Anyway,last year she said she was hoping for trail magic right there at that road in the 100 mile wilderness. This year she made it happen for us!   Thank you Baguette!  
A NOBO took Hugs’ information while we were there. If it’s still at the campsite she’ll be mailing her hat back soon.  Trail blessings everywhere!  
One more thing was one the agenda for Jo Mary road. Lloyd our shuttle driver had hidden our next 4 days of food in a bucket in a tree a little further up the road.  His orange ribbon took us right there.  My Gatorade was at the base of the tree too.  This was our plan.  Flawless execution Lloyd! Thank you!  
I think my lucky penny did it’s job at Jo Mary road!  
I’ve been meaning to tell my readers that Hugs has a Facebook page anybody can follow.  She posts photos, and I post words. Look her up as GOING NOBO on Facebook., and like her page.  
We stopped at a shelter for lunch.  It was so peaceful there. Neither of us wanted to get going again.  But we did... only 8 miles left to go. 
The trail ran beside a nice stream again today.  I was enjoying the music thinking that I had really only seen toads so far.   Then just as I rounded the corner, there was another pheasant. He was a big guy!  I watched him fly away with a little struggle getting that tubby body up off the ground. I’m still on high alert for moose though.  
I came to an old logging road with nice sized boulders beside it. I waited there for Hugs.  Only 4.7 miles left to go.  
From my comfy boulder I hiked straight up Little Boardman Mountain.  This was my first big climb with my now full again pack.  It was only 2009ft elevation but it was tough. 
Darkness had arrived by the time we crossed the river just before our shelter. My backpack rubbed the back of my headlamp some way and the wiring went bad. No More Headlamp!  Ugh!  I followed Hugs into camp.  
I cannot go to sleep without wishing a Happy 12th birthday to my granddaughter Charley Faye!   I can’t believe you’re 12 years old already!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602185,"It was a night of broken sleep.  As always you take chances sleeping in a shelter.  There was a mouse party last night and it kept me awake.   
There was a little rain shower this morning around 6:30am.  I woke up just as Midwest Mama Was coming back from the creek.  She had tented beside the shelter last night.  She mentioned thunderstorms this afternoon.  Her and I had a great conversation!  She’s from Chicago and her daughter is moving to Arlington Heights. I love Arlington Heights!  Northwest Community Hospital’s E.R. Is the best!  
Midwest Mama left quickly. She had a food drop off scheduled for today.  Since I had arrived in the dark, I decided to checkout the campsite.  Wow!  The terrain near the privy was like it was from another world.  I felt like I was on the show Lost In Space. There were little islands of sorts. They each had a tree or trees growing on it. All of the trees had roots growing over big boulders.  It just felt not of this planet.  
Hugs and I hit the trail knowing we had a couple of big climbs ahead of us.  I was in the lead but not making great time.  The tree roots are so thick I couldn’t look up at all. The next thing I know I whacked my head on a fallen tree.  Hard!  My teeth clanked together.  I started looking up more often after that happened. 
I had started the ascent of Whitecap Mountain.  3644ft UP.  At times it was difficult climbing. I had to use my hands and arms often to get up and over the next level/obstacle pretty often.  It was usually a jump in land level with a giant tree root in the way...sometimes a boulder. 
Eventually I came to a reasonably clear path.  There I saw a big fat toad.  He’s the first big one I’ve seen in many days. There’s a bajillion babies. It was nice at that moment and I was able to look up and around.   
That’s when I saw him...Flower Boy! Aka/Mike from Maine!   My heart skipped a beat!   We started this crazy thing at the same time in Georgia. He was one of my original trail brothers, and I’ve missed him!   He looks great!  Down 40lbs with nothing left to lose, but he’s almost done.  He can see Katahdin now!  We joked how my trail name should be “hammer”.  I started this journey with a tiny hammer in my pack... ha-ha!!! It went home from Neals Gap!  We gave a quick hug and had to hike on, but what a great blast from the past!  
Another half mile up the trail was a shelter. A perfect lunch spot on this ascent.  I refilled my water and washed a set of clothing before Hugs arrived.  We shared a tuna roll up and chips for lunch.  We met Opa there. He has a journal on Trail Journals too.  
UP we go again!  Soon Whitecap Mountain became all rock.  Everything blended in on the trail. Mostly browns, greys, and whites. That’s how I nearly stepped on a brown snake!  I just didn’t see the little guy.  He scurried under a rock as I jumped back when I saw him move.  
I stopped on the side of the mountain just before the summit.  The view was spectacular and there was a nice cool breeze. I hung my laundry on my trekking poles in hopes they dry by tomorrow. Cell service was good right there so I just sat by myself for about an hour.  Hugs caught up and passed me in that time.  
Dark clouds started rolling overhead and I had 6 miles to the shelter so I better move along.  It sprinkled a little bit, but nothing more the rest of the day.  The sprinkles only heated things up. This has been one of my worst days for sweating. My eyes burned from sweat all day long!  
Once again I’ve wasted a lot of time and with no headlamp I need to get to camp before dark.  That did not happen. I got water at the river just before dark then made my way up to camp with the tiniest little flashlight.  I’m so glad Papa Big Swig was insistent that I carry something for a backup!  The moon is still pretty full and that helped as I pitched my tent in the dark.  
Another great day...still no moose

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602228,"I slept like a baby in my tent last night. It’s far better than dealing with mice in the shelter.  The breezes were blowing little pine cones down on top of my tent. I woke to thud, thud-thud-thud, thud.   Who needs an alarm clock!  
The trail started out going down today. Water is plentiful here. There’s always a creek or river near by.  That means when I go DOWN, it can get boggy. That’s how it was for a couple of miles this morning.  The mud and swampiness of it all made me feel like I was in the Louisiana Bayou.  
Once I started back UP the feel was completely different. To my right was the river with a small but lovely waterfall. The rivers here are always crystal clear.  They’re beautiful to see and beautiful to hear.  Just past the waterfall was a big ole pile of moose poop! Still no moose!  My favorite thing about going up was the big white pines. Every now and then it smells like Christmas.  My mind goes back to mom’s warm gingerbread with homemade whipped cream on top.  
I came to some log benches by the river and decided to wait for Hugs.  When she arrived we took a little break and removed our boots. We had to walk across this river in our Crocs. 
Very quickly I began going UP. This was 3.4 miles up to Chairback Mountain. The grade was steep in the beginning. I broke a good sweat. About halfway up there was a false summit that gave some reprieve before I started UP again.  
I continue to call this portion of the 100 the “tree root trail”.  Planning my footing for every step is painstaking.  I saw another toad today hiding out in the roots.  I’ve never seen a toad this big before in my life.  He was bigger than my fist!  
I took a little break at the summit of Chairback Mountain. There views from the ledges for a good while. Today’s photo is one of those views.  Sometimes I look down from a mountain top and I’m just in awe of how much land there really is.  Miles and miles and miles of pine trees and lakes is all I saw.  It was something to behold.   
It was only 0.5 miles from there to my campsite at Chairback Gap Lean-to.  I pitched a tent again with plenty of daylight.  Unless I can’t help it, I’m not sleeping in a shelter again.  The mice are too much!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602408,"I slept well in my tent last night.  Hugs put her tent up inside the shelter. Then there was Nola.  Nola is a section hiker who doesn’t yet understand hiker etiquette.  For example 8pm is hiker midnight and we’re all trying to go to sleep. Do not blurt out random thoughts whenever.  If a mouse jumps on you just knock it off...or start sleeping in your tent.  The worst one is, if you’re up before sunrise don’t wake those who aren’t. 
Hugs took all she could this morning before packing up very early and moving on. We planned to meet at the shelter tonight.  I giggled a little when Nola left right behind her.  
So I was the last one out of camp. No rush, we had a short day planned. 
It was 1.7 miles to the next water source.  That will be stop #1 since there was barely enough water to cook with last night.  Hugs had left camp without any water at all.  I had about 12 ounces to get me 1.7 miles.   
I was happy to be hiking alone today.  This giant pine forest is so serene. It’s a very quiet forest.  My eyes were open for moose, but my visitors were mostly chipmunks and squirrels.  
The water source was nice.  It was a small falls with clear water flowing. Much better than the mud and moss pit we had last night.  
A group of NOBO’s arrived. I knew right away it was Handstand and Luke! Wow!  I haven’t seen them since right past the Smokey’s.  They were in the same shelter that night we were all singing and listening to the Ukulele.   It was the best and worst day all wrapped up into one. We’ll remember each other forever.   
I hiked on alone.  It wasn’t long before I had to check Guthook.  I had meandered off trail.  This happened a few times.  That part of the 100 mile wilderness needs new blazes.  I’m not sure how many miles I made my way through without seeing a clear blaze.  
There was a lot of rock climbing today.  The terrain goes up and down often with steep grades.  I was sweating plenty and really going through the water.
 Down in a bog I came across a green snake sunning on a rock.  I needed the rock!  Even with all of my encouragement he took his time moving along.   
There’s a bush in the forest with leaves just starting to change colors.  It reminds me of a firebush from home except the leaves here turn a plum color.  It’s really pretty amongst these tall tall pines.  
Sometimes I walk through this forest and picture lumberjacks out here doing their job.  Lots of flannel on big burly men with boots and beards. The old logging roads can still be seen. That whole life and time is so appealing to me.  
The UPS eventually became grueling. Finding footing and hand holds was difficult. Once I finished an up and thought I could just “hike” a bit, I’d have to look down continuously stepping over roots and rocks.  The roots here are like no other place I’ve ever seen!  That’s where a brown snake took me by surprise!  Those brown ones are so well camouflaged!  I never see them. 
I came to a blue blaze for a shelter 0.4 miles off trail.  I dislike adding on that kind of mileage ever, but especially so when I’m full packing.  A section hiker was sitting at the intersection reading,  so I dropped pack there and took my water bags only for a water re-supply. 
Water has been scarce the past two days.  This was pond water, not my usual flowing spring or creek water, but I took 3 liters.  Hard to believe I had already drank 3 liters. This terrain was hard work! 
About an hour later I climbed my way to the top of a mountain with a great view!  4 NOBO’s were sitting there.  One asked if I was Blue Raccoon?  Hugs had mentioned my name to Blue Butterfly.  We enjoyed sharing “Blue” for a moment. Hugs was not too far ahead of me they said.  I found that strange since she left camp a whole 90 minutes before I did.  I do hike faster, but not that much faster, and today was especially slow.  
I reached the next summit and took a moment for another amazing view.  There was a young college girl up there. She’s been sectioning four years and will complete the A.T. this year.  We started talking about time.  She said in the end she will have spent 8.5 months hiking the A.T. to completion.  I’m going to be almost 7 months.  During that conversation I realized I was only averaging about 1 mile per hour today.  That’s extremely slow compared to my usual 2-2.5mph. The terrain was not giving me a break today.  
The sun starts getting low around 4:30pm now. By 7:00 it’s dark.  Without a headlamp I hurried on to the shelter.  After 10.5 hours I hiked only 10.9 miles, but I was finally there. 
Hugs on the other hand was not there. Papa Jay said she chose to pitch her tent by the river because she needed water. He pointed me back to the A.T. and towards the river. Oh no... it’s dark now.  
I was grateful for an almost full moon, and marched on. The river was about 0.3 miles. I arrived to find no tent sites. It was all rock, root and mud.  Still no Hugs.  I hiked on another 1/10th nothing.  At this point I’m worried I’ll not find her, not find anywhere to throw my tent, and I’ll have to hike all the way back to the shelter. I was mad! I called out her name...nothing.  I just kept going.  After what felt like forever I heard a shout from above, “BLUE RACCOON!!”  It was Hugs.  Thank God!  But I was still so mad! 
She had not found a tentsite either. I took the lead and moved quickly to the first place I thought two tents would fit. Maybe another 1/4 mile. I have no idea what time it was by then. Threw my tent up, made some ramen and fell asleep to the sound of a waterfall.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602448,"I woke up this morning about 6:30 to the sound of waterfalls.  Ahhh bliss. I made myself a tea of sorts. This is my last night in the 100, and I was out of tea, so I boiled water and poured it into my cup with a jolly rancher in it. I had a nice warm fruity drink, minus much needed caffeine.  
I made sure Hugs was awake(she was), and I started packing up camp.  I haven’t seen Papa Big Swig in about two weeks and today when I pop out he’ll be there...0nly 14.5 miles to go! 
I put a few things away then pulled the rain fly off my tent. Without any warning or indication it was coming, rain began to fall.   Nooooo!   Not in my tent! I grabbed the rain fly and haphazardly threw it over the top before I jumped inside. 3/4 of my tent was properly covered and 1/4 was not.  EVERYTHING was soaked!  Sleeping bag and all.  Not a great start to my last day out here.  
We both packed up our wet tents as soon as the downpour stopped.  I packed up the rest of my wet gear, and braced myself for a very heavy pack.  I hated being right. Guessing it at over 45lbs...Ugh! 
Ok here we go.   More UPs that really take effort and maneuvering.  I woke up with a stitch in my ribs today. Taking a deep breath is difficult. Moving a certain way is painful...what on earth?!?  Hiking today was just exhausting.  
I came to a large rockslide and was still figuring out my way when Hugs arrived. I finally deciphered a path and turned to go.  Just then I heard that familiar sound of loose footing.  I turned in time to watch Hugs take a HARD fall on the rocks.  It was bad.  She cried, I cried.  But in true Blue Raccoon and Hugs fashion we worked together, shook it off and trudged on.  Trust me, shaking off a fall on hard jagged boulders with all of this extra weight slamming you down is not an easy thing. 
I was in the lead again. Breathing hard on those UP’s, mouth wide open, I got a big fat flying something all the way in.  I coughed and spit and coughed and spit some more. Until I finally had to swallow.   Chug-a-lug went my limited water, and I just kept on moving.  
4.7 miles down the trail was a shelter.  I stopped for a break and water feeling pretty down. Hugs arrived feeling equally low as me.  She found a logging road on Guthook’s that was 5 or 6 miles further.  10 more miles just wasn’t in us today.  
I must have been so hungry.   I was salivating smelling ham and eggs!  I laughed at myself deciding this must be olfactory hallucinations!  
Another brown snake took me by surprise.  Good thing these things aren’t venomous!  
I came to a river crossing and waited for Hugs there. There was a nice split log bench to sit on where we could remove our boots. This would be a full on hold a rope river crossing. I put on my crocs, held on tight and carried my pack across.  It was difficult in the middle when the current grabbed me.  Whoever put up that rope is a saint! 
Just a few more miles was our logging road. We bravely took our chances and in 0.8 miles we found civilization! Papa Big Swig was there to rescue us.  That’s my knight!  
After 8 days we finally got a much needed shower,  a burger, and clean laundry.

We were still up early. Papa Big Swig took us to a local bakery for breakfast. Then it was time to pack up the R-pod and move to the next campsite.  
The move really didn’t take long. Once we got here Hugs and I both set up our tents to dry. Emptied our backpacks, and cleaned our gear.  We did it all with a celebratory mimosa in hand!  We’re pretty impressed with ourselves summiting Katahdin and surviving the 100 mile wilderness!   
All the sudden it was 4:30pm and we had not eaten a thing since breakfast! We’re in Maine, so we went straight to the local seafood restaurant and ordered a lot of food!  
Rosie was our server, she was great! She was hilarious!  At one point she grabbed Hugs steamer with her bare hand, put through a rinse and had Hugs eat it.  Just like we were all family!  
Lobster stew was my appetizer, followed by a salad, snd broiled scallops with a baked potato. Yummy!   
Then I looked at the dessert menu and there it was, warm gingerbread with whipped cream!  I couldn’t believe it! The serving was huge so we split that 3 ways.  I was stuffed!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602569,"On the way to our Logging Road this morning we stopped by the ATC visitor Center.  We were looking for information about a phone app that is a map of all the Maine logging roads.  It would be nice for Papa Big Swig to have that since he’s shuttling us again.  A ridge runner told us about it, but nobody seems to know the name of the app. 
Papa Big Swig dropped us off where we had jumped out two days ago.   We get no credit for the 0.8 miles back to the trail, but it was a fun adventure this morning.  
I love blue blazing and exploring!  We stumbled upon a hidden cabin in the woods. I couldn’t resist!   Just had to go peek in the windows.  It was a REALLY nice hunting cabin!  Loft bedrooms, all hardwoods.  I was thinking I could live in that thing.   It was empty inside. Not a stick of furniture, not even a curtain up on any windows. I wondered if anybody uses that place at all.  What a shame if it just sits there empty. 
The air was crisp and cool this morning. It stayed that way all day.  I was chilled from morning to sunset. That’s when Papa Big Swig picked us up. Tomorrow’s high is 66 degrees. It will only be in the 40’s when my day begins. I guess it’s back to wearing layers for me.  That change sure happened quick! 
The trail was great today!  It was also my first day slack packing again.  I loved feeling like I was taking a stroll in the park! It was especially scenic today as well. I hiked beside a river or pond much of the day, and when I was up high the views were splendid...and there were many of them!  
Hugs and I stopped together for lunch up on some ledges.  We were hoping for some sunshine to warm us up. The sun was out, but the temperature and breezes left us chilly during lunch.  
NOBO’s are coming in regularly now. I probably saw 7 or 8 today.  Hugs and I are back in the bubble.  It’s a bit strange to have others around us after being pretty much alone for many weeks. This is definitely the way to do it though.  They are so excited to be this far!  I’m so excited for them too!  
I’m continuing to have issues with blazes. Or Should I say lack of blazes? Three times today I had no idea where the trail was. Hugs left a comment on a sign-in sheet about the problem.  I hope it draws someone’s attention.  
Maine might need to do better with blazes, but they are top notch with boardwalks! Between  the mountains here there’s almost always a bog.  If there were such a thing as a “northern swamp” these bogs would be it.  No worries though, the M.A.T.C. Keeps us out of the mess. 
I found myself singing that song “What A Difference A Day Makes” as I walked today.  An occasional zero definitely reboots me!  I loved smelling the pines.  These pines are so tall that they sway in the breeze. I heard several of them creeking as they swayed.  It literally sounded like a squeaky wooden floor. 
With about 6 miles left to go I looked up at some oncoming NOBO’s, and saw two familiar faces.  It was Firepink and SP! Oh happy day!!! I thought I may never see them again.  And they’re both so skinny!   
After my little tramily reunion the trail just flew by. I hiked past more moose poop, still no moose, across an ice cold creek, and to a logging road where Papa Big Swig patiently waited.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602681,"Today we chose to do a NOBO flip flop. That sounds so funny!  We always did SOBO flip flops before, but we ARE SOBO’s now!  My morning hike started going UP!  It was the hardest UP of the day. Pleasant Pond Mountain 2477ft elevation....it WAS the hardest, but it really wasn’t all that hard.  
No matter how difficult or not difficult, the pay off was absolutely spectacular! Today’s photo is of view #1. I enjoyed views like that all day long! 
The trail was nice today.  As always there were a few rocks and roots, but mostly a pine needle carpet. 
Hugs and I hiked together until lunch time.  We stopped at a flat area on top, pulled up a rock and enjoyed lunch with some sunshine. 
After lunch I took the lead but Hugs was close behind. I came upon a woodpecker.  Well I guess it was a woodpecker. It was shaped like one and pecked the trees like one, but it was a blue/grey color. No red head! 
Shortly after that I came across a baby brown snake.  I saw him this time and he was only about 5 inches long. Cute little thing.  I tried to keep him corralled until Hugs arrived, but he scooted under a dead log and I lost him.  
I walked on until I saw I familiar face.  It was Nola!  Hugs caught up while we were chatting, and made her way right on by us!   I was giggling to myself! 
I wished Nola well and continued on the trail. Eventually I popped out of the woods onto a gravel road. I walked the road a little ways beside a pond until I went back up into the woods.  
Soon I was going UP on the second of my two big climbs today. This was Moxie Bald Mountain 2629ft. On the way up I came to a unique cave created by fallen rock.   There was suppose to be a plaque mounted in the rock there honoring a hiker, but I never saw that plaque. The higher I climbed, the cooler this mountain became.   The bald was mostly rock, and it was huge!   Views were 360 degrees around, and I could see for miles and miles!!  I love this mountain!   Moxie Bald is now my most favorite mountain on the trail! 
I took my time up there to soak it all in, but when I needed to get moving I kicked it up a gear.  The trail all the way down was nice. Like the base of most mountains here in Maine there was a bog at the bottom.  Some volunteers did a great job placing rocks that took me all the way out to Papa Big Swig. 
Hugs arrived about 10 minutes after me and we headed straight to Monson.  Firepink and S.P. were waiting for us to pick them up.  
We all went to the local pub & grill for dinner and drinks.  When we walked in, and there was Her Dudeness! She wasn’t eating, she was our server!  What!?!   She had hiked into Monson and ran out of money so she’s working.  We had so much fun!  
Papa Big Swig was our designated driver. He made sure everyone got home safely.  I’m so glad I was able to spend some time with some of my favorite trail sisters before they headed into the Hundred tomorrow.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602758,"What a day!  Just a few miles in I crossed the 1500 mile mark!  Wooo Hooo!   
I was in the lead this morning.  The nice thing about being in the lead is that I hike quietly and often times I get to see animals that I wouldn’t get to see if I was talking with someone. That’s what happened today.  
Off to my right in the woods was a bird.  It was a ground bird.  I thought maybe a turkey.  It was quite round with a small head.  Grey-ish in color.  It moved fast on its feet!   I was going to try to get a photo and as I moved in it clucked!  Like a chicken!  It clucked a few times.  Now I’m confused.  Are there wild grey chickens in these mountains? 
Then I passed by a pile of logs and boards. It was obvious these pine logs have been made into boards by axe.  I could see the axe marks.  Wow!  That takes skill!   Later in the day I saw another pile like that one.  I’m so impressed!  
I only had about 6 miles from the start this morning to reach a little village known as Caratunk.  In 2016 it was population 68.   It definitely has not grown any since then. We walked to a very old home known as the Caratunk House.  It’s a hiker hostel/BnB and they serve pulled pork sandwiches for lunch!   Hugs and I each ate one, then split another one! I had a milkshake and Hugs had regular ice cream.  They offer free WiFi rtoo.  It was great!
Guess who showed up while Hugs was checking out?  NOLA!  Oh giggle giggle!   Without using her name I had shared her story with the Caratunk House folks...then there she was!  
With full bellies we hiked back into the woods. It was a short distance before we reached the Kennebec River where a very playful Golden Retriever pup greeted us! Her name is Maggie. Maggie’s dad would be our guide across the Kennebec.  This is the only part of the A.T. you do not walk.  The river currents are too strong.  From 9am to 2pm the ATC provides a free ferry ride across. While we were signing our waivers little miss Maggie made off with one of Hugs gloves! She was so sad to have to give it back. 
When I learned of this ferry crossing, I expected a “ferry”. It was a CANOE!  Oh no!! I’m known for tipping every canoe I’ve ever been in...yikes!  I sat down in the middle and said a prayer.  I didn’t budge.  Poor Hugs had to help paddle with Maggie’s daddy.  We made it! 
Once we hiked up and away from the river I got ahead of Hugs and stayed there the rest of the day.  It was very nice and peaceful. I was beside water all afternoon.  At times it was a pond and other times a stream.  Pierce Pond Stream Falls were beautiful and refreshing!  I spent a good amount of time sitting on a rock watching rushing water cascade down. I also enjoyed listening to waves crash on the beach of East Carry Pond.
 I eventually walked up and away from all the water. Hugs caught up with me and we popped out on the road where Papa Big Swig would be picking us up. There he was walking our 4 legged girls!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602760,"It rained all night and into the morning. We knew this was coming because of Hurricane Florence.  
Our plan was to start late and hike a NERO.  The rain stopped before we got out of the SUV. We did a NOBO flip flop again today for Papa Big Swig’s convenience.  
 I started into the woods first going up. Everything was wet and slippery. This makes for a long day of cautious hiking. Even if it is a NERO day. 
Not many critters were out. I saw several toads, squirrels, and chipmunks. What really caught my attention though was the birds.  I heard the most unique bird sounds I’ve ever heard!  I videotaped them in hopes that someone can tell me what they are. Actually, as I’m journaling this right now, Hugs and I are listening to them.  
Today was another day hiking beside water. I stepped up to the banks many times looking for moose, but still no luck. I did see lots of new happy fungus! Mushrooms of all colors! My favorites today were they baby red ones. 
I was doing a lot of thinking today.  I enjoy being alone with my own thoughts.  I’ve come to realize a few things about myself out here. For example, I love hardwood & ceramic flooring, but I really NEED carpeting. My hips and knees appreciate the soft cushion of carpet. Pine straw carpet is definitely one of the reasons why I love a nice pine forest so much!  Another thing, I need to live where there are all 4 seasons. I look forward to leaves changing color and the first snowfall.  It’s just who I am.  
I was enjoying being alone with my thoughts so much that I didn’t break at the shelter.  There were people there.  I avoided them today.  
Just before the end of my hike I went to the pond one last time. Still no moose, but it looked like smoke rising off the mountains across it. That’s today’s photo.  
I popped out onto the road, but no Papa Big Swig. I walked a half mile up the road, and still no Papa Big Swig.  I came back and Hugs was looking for me.  Still no Papa Big Swig.  We sat by the gate  and waited. Almost 2 hours of waiting! There had been an accident and he was re-routed.  
We were beyond ready when he finally pulled up.  Our early home plan was not going to happen.  We aimed for the campsite and buckled up for a rough 30 minutes on old logging roads.  That’s when it happened!  Right in front of us running down and across the gravel road was a moose! Yes yes yes!  As far as moose’s go it was a small one, but even small ones are pretty big!  That was worth the 2 hour wait!

Where’s your faith?","East Flagstaff Road
",Lane Pond Road,"Sep 11, Tue",8.90
Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602876,"This morning started going UP. Hugs and I knew we had 3 BIG UP’s today and we chose to stick together.  There would be some mountain climbing, and steep Downs.  To top it all off everything is still wet.  
So began our hike over the Bigelows. The first climb was Little Bigelow Mountain at 3025ft. The climbs were hard, but the payoff was grand!   I enjoyed and photographed every single view.  At times I thought this has got to be what heaven is like!  
What goes up must come down.   As the trail became boulder going down, my boots lost traction and down I went.  Mostly I just slid on my butt, and other than the jolt to my body, there was no real injury. 
Hugs was ahead of me most of the day.  Always within shouting distance, but ahead.  Just as I caught her and told her about my fall, she took a fall too.  These wet downs are tricky.  Literally we inch our way down with most of our weight on our trekking poles. That means we are bent over going down moving our trekking poles forward then shuffling our feet up to our poles. Then move our poles forward again and so on. Sometimes this goes on for miles.  
There’s usually a plateau of some type between mountains.  In Maine it’s generally a boggy area. Then the journey UP begins again. Today’s UPs will total approximately 5200ft elevation gain.  We started the very long trek up Bigelow Avery Peak at 4088ft elevation.  This will take many hours. 
Today was a physical challenge. Hugs threw her poles up over a boulder and worked her way over. I started behind her and got part way up when my boots lost traction again....down went McGinney!  This one hurt!  An abrasion on my left shin and a big ole goose egg under my left knee, nice and purple. Ugh!  It wasn’t 10 minutes later before Hugs went down again.  She still had no injury, but that jolt is enough. 
Continuing up we noticed the trees.  There are trees here with white bark that peels off. I’ve noticed it for some time, but today we talked about it.  It reminds me of the cardboard roll that goes around a can of biscuit dough. It peels off and kind of rolls back up like that.  
Today was really all about the views, but I did see a couple of fuzzy caterpillars.  They were black and yellow like a bumblebee. Then I heard a scuttle off to my left.  I looked over to see a little red squirrel with some of that tree bark.  It was hilarious watching him try to manage it!  The bark was like curling ribbon.  He had it in his mouth trying to get a grip with his “hands”, but it kept curling back around his hands and he was so aggravated!  
I met about 5 or 6 NOBOs getting excited to hit the 100 and summit Katahdin. One of them was Giggles.  The last time I saw her was at 4 Pines Hostel in Catawba VA. She looked great, and she was excited for her finish.   
We came to some ledges with a nice view and sat down for lunch.  It was already 2pm. This terrain makes for tediously slow hiking. We sat for 20 minutes which eventually became our ONLY break for the day.  
We hiked on up Bigelow Mountain.  This mountain has two peaks. The first was Bigelow Avery Peak at 4088ft elevation.  Wow wow wow!!!  The views!  All of the literal blood and sweat was so worth it!! 
Onward to Bigelow West Peak at 4145 ft elevation.  The trek down from Avery Peak was more of the same painstaking steps.  This will take a while!  
Once again the views were awesome!  We had views all day long! Spectacular views!  But time was ticking and we had to move on.  One more big climb to go.  
On to South Horn 3831ft elevation. Again it took forever.  By the time we got there we had to pull out our headlamps for the descent. We knew we would be doing some night hiking tonight.  Papa Big Swig was scheduled to pick us up at 8:30pm.  It’s pretty dark by 7:30 now.  
Looking at Guthook’s we realized we still had 6 miles to go.  I rescheduled Papa Big Swig for 10pm.  Ugh!  
We began our descent.  The sun was setting quickly and off to the right were brilliant red, orange, and pink colors.  It was like fire in the sky.  So beautiful.  
This was a great night for night hiking.  No rain!  The temperature was perfect, just a little crisp.  I like that.  It was pitch black with no moon and moths kept flying to our headlamps. 
At one point we saw a light coming towards us.  It was another hiker. He had already made camp, but came out to check on us when he heard us.  I’m sure he wondered why two girls were out at 10pm. Yes it was 10pm!  Papa Big Swig has to be rescheduled again.  
Hugs and I switched off leading. I noticed how certain white boulders sort of glowed in the night.  It was nice. They were like beacons on the trail.  I was coming down off of one of them when I slipped again. By the grace of God I fell backwards onto a small tree that had just enough give. I didn’t get hurt. 
We still had a couple of small ups and downs, then one giant down left to go. One of the small downs lead to another bog.  The ATC has split logs and makes a boardwalk of sorts out of them.   Hugs had the lead here and stepping from one log to another she slipped. It was a hard fall.  She was hurt.  She said she just wanted to cry, but she didn’t.  We carried on.  It’s what we do.  
As the night hours crept into early morning hours we were exhausted.  We had taken one 20 minutes lunch break all day.  
As we came upon a stream I got my second wind. Hugs was still recovering from her last fall. I told  her “We are strong” and “We are brave”... because I honestly think we are!  We will do this!  
At 1:30am we made it to the parking area where Papa Big Swig (a bit worried) waited for us.  It had taken over 15 hours to hike only 16.6 miles!  Hugs said “not all 16 miles are created equal”!  I laughed knowing she’s right. We certainly underestimated this 16!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603007,"Today got off to a much better start.  Thank goodness!  We were out the door early and planned a NERO so we wouldn’t be hiking until after 1am again.   
Papa Big Swig dropped us off at a gate on a gravel road.  We had to walk a half mile to the trail. It was a nice graveled walk and very clearly marked was the A.T. sign.  
We did a NOBO flip flop again, and the day started out going UP.  The terrain had some rocks and roots but not nearly to the extent it had been.  That was nice.  
I wore a new pair of boots today. Between Rocksylvania and Katahdin my last pair was worn out.  They were close, but didn’t quite get 500 miles on them.  That’s pretty much the standard for new boots and the A.T.   
Hugs had the lead today.  She sometimes plays music while she hikes and today was one of those days.  I much prefer the sounds of the forest, so I stayed pretty far back.  
My radio station is chirps and tweets... I love it!  Thanks to my readers I’ve determined that wild chicken was a Spruce Grouse.  And let me yell you they sing a beautiful tune!! 
I listened to chirps,whistles, and tweets all the way up South Crocker Mountain at 4050ft elevation. I stopped about 3/4 of the way up and turned around for the view of where I had been.  Then I climbed to the summit and took in another view.  
Going down the other side was a little tedious but much less than the Bigelows were two days ago. There are still wet areas in places, but the ground is trying to dry up too. My new boots still look fairly new! 
My next UP was North Crocker Mountain at 4228ft.  The grade of the incline was nice.   I climbed it quickly and really didn’t expend a lot of energy.  Today felt so effortless that I didn’t even bother to stop for lunch. That’s a first! 
The decline was steeper than South Crocker had been, but not horrible.  It was a long long down to the parking area where Papa Big Swig was waiting.  He had picked up another hiker Jack Rabbit whom we dropped off in town at a BBQ joint.  
I’m back at our campsite early.  This is good because I’m getting my big pack ready for a couple of days out.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603169,"With our full packs on, we started our hike going UP this morning. Then right away we had a river crossing. It was the South Branch Carrabassett River.  Hugs went first. It was a difficult crossing with swift water and wet rocks. A full pack made it even more difficult.  Once we were about halfway across we could see a boardwalk was there. It went from two big boulders to the shore on the other side.  Thank goodness! 
It wasn’t long before we came to  a rock slide.   More tedious climbing. The trail beyond it was pretty good though...until it wasn’t.  
During the good terrain I got ahead a little bit.  I usually do that when things are easy hiking. I like to hike quietly to see and hear what the forest has to offer me. Today it offered me two mice. One was chasing the other!  I had no idea that mice came out during daylight. It was really cute to watch until my presence scared them in two different directions. 
Soon enough the journey started back UP. I was working on Spaulding Mountain 4010ft elevation. This was going to take some time!  I had to drop pack once in order to get up over some boulders. My trekking poles were thrown up ahead of me several times. Hugs looked on Guthook’s and found an unmarked Logging Road. She thought maybe Papa Big Swig could pick us up there tonight.  He said he will give it a try. 
On the way up I crossed paths with Turn. I haven’t seen her since North Carolina.  She had been hiking with Just Kelly(aka Stryker).  It’s funny I was thinking of Just Kelly yesterday. She’s about 4 days behind so hopefully I’ll see her soon!  
We stopped for lunch at the top. My phone rang while I was there.  I was surprised to see it was my Aunt Fran!  She was just checking on me.... I think because of the hurricane.  We had no effects here really except maybe some rain. She said North Carolina is a mess.  Keeping them in my prayers. 
The A.T. doesn’t quite go to the summit of Spaulding.  There’s a blue blaze 200 yards up for the summit and a view of Sugar Loaf and two other mountains. We decided to leave our packs and take the blue blaze. It was a disappointment.  Trees had fallen, there was no view to be seen. 
When we arrived back at our lunch stop 3 NOBO’s were breaking there too.  It really was the only place to break for miles. One of them was Blue Streak.  He remembered us from Woodchucks Hostel in Damascus.  After he reminded me, I remembered him too.  
As we were hiking to the logging road it grew dark. We then realized that we have no idea which way to turn on the road to get to Papa Big Swig. We knew from a local it was gated off some distance back. Worse yet...we lost cell service.  
Hugs was praying for a miracle. 
It was pitch black when we arrived.  It appeared we could only go right. Then suddenly I got a text message. It was from my sister of the heart. I had service!  I called Papa Big Swig immediately. It turns out that he had to go back to the campsite because the closest he could get was 12 miles away. Just like that I lost phone service again. 
Hugs had gotten her miracle!  
It was no big deal that he couldn’t get us. We pitched our tents right on the road beside Orbeton Stream, and closed our eyes knowing everybody was fine.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603214,"Woke up on Sluice Logging Road listening to the water fall. The day started going down.  It was a fairly steep down to a river. I had another early morning river crossing. 
Then the trail started UP. It was also a steep up. The lower we get in Maine it seems the steeper and more difficult the UPs and DOWNs become.  
I was mainly looking down as I climbed up, and saw another one of those big fat toads. He was too fast for a photo, so I moved on. 
Another steep up was right before me.  As I started the climb there before me was a familiar face.  It was Jingle!  The last time I saw him was at Sufi Lodge. He looks great!   His only complaint was a sore knee and lost glasses.  I had to giggle a little!  Hugs arrived just in time to share our glasses saga. We said a quick good luck and happy trails before we carried on hiking.  
I continued up 3120ft to Poplar Ridge.  The last couple days of UP’s have been brutal!  This is what I can expect from now until I’m out of the White’s.  Hugs and I are down to a mile an hour or less.  We met a couple of young NOBO’s who said the same thing. This is just how it is right now.  
The descent from Poplar Ridge was tedious at times, but I made it down just fine.  
My next up was Saddleback JR. Very quickly it went from hiking to mountain climbing.  I came to a boulder about the size of a small car, threw my poles up and began finding footing.  About my second step up, the foothold just didn’t hold, and down went McGinney!  My whole right side took a beating again!  It’s not pretty! I managed to tear a hole in the pocket of my shorts too.  Ugh!  
I made it up on the second try and continued up to a shelter. They call them “lean-to’s” here in Maine. I re-supplied my water and ate some peanut butter crackers.  Until Hugs arrived.  
The mountain climbing continued 3640ft to the top of saddleback JR Mountain. Many times I had to throw my poles to find handholds. I had to pull myself up plus that extra 35lbs on my back. It was brutal! 
 
The descent was no better. Very steep downs.  Often times I had to move like an old lady.  Hunched over a drop off with my weight on my poles debating if my knees could take the jolt if I jumped, or should I just sit on my butt? Sitting on my butt is another time consuming process with a 35lb pack on my back.  There’s no “easy” way! 
On my way down I heard some hammering ahead. The closer I got I could see orange hard hats.  Soon enough I learned it was the MCC(Maine Conservancy Corps).  This is a group of volunteers who had chosen this very difficult  section of the trail to put some stone steps in.  Wow!  The perfect place!  I was able to use about 20 of those stone steps on my way down, and my knees enjoyed those 20 steps! 
Not far past the steps I met up with a NOBO who recognized me and Hugs.  His name is Smokey. He’s a young 20 something with great manners.  He sort of sheltered with us in that shelter that was a half mile down off trail.  After he ate, he went back up and pitched his tent beside the trail.  Looking back, that was a smart move. 
Anyway, while we were talking I reached down in my pocket for my phone. It was gone!  I forgot that pocket had ripped out when I fell. Oh no!!! Smokey said “I’ll run ahead and look for it”. With his full pack on he took off like a bolt of lightning.  I dropped pack and followed, but he was long gone.  I had went about 1/8th of a mile when I saw him running back. He was winded when he handed me my phone with a smile. I was sooo grateful!  He asked for nothing, but I had $40 on me, and I gave it to him.  He was hesitant but I assured him that I wanted him to have it.  He was embarrassed but he took it.  I’m so glad he did!  
Hugs and I both went off trail a good ways to get water. This would be our last water source until we were done with two more mountains.  I filled my bottles and put a 2 liter bag in the top of my pack. It was REALLY heavy as I began the climb up The Horn at 4041ft elevation.  Talk about mountain climbing!  It was by far the hardest climb of the day. It took hours to climb up with only a 1.1 mile gain. I gave Hugs some of my water once I summited, but I already carried all of that water the whole way up. We were both exhausted already with a goal to get to a shelter still 6 miles away.  We both knew that wasn’t happening.  
So we started down The Horn. It was tedious but much less difficult than the climb up.  Just as we reached the summit there was a sign saying no camping for the next 3 miles. 
We could see Saddleback Mountain during our descent, and the climb up looked like it would be a nice climb. Saddleback would be our last big climb of the day.  
Our eyes were deceiving us from afar, Saddleback took some muscle too. Not as much as The Horn, but enough from these already weary bodies that it wiped us out.  
About 2/3rds of the way up we knew we were done.  9 hours of hiking and only 7 miles behind us. There are no campsites on Saddleback Mountain.  It’s a bald with mostly rock and some fragile vegetation the ATC requests hikers stay off of.  So we put our sleep pads on the rock and laid our sleeping bags out.... it’s cowboy camping tonight!  
It was windy up there, but we were able to cook dinner, get everything packed away in our packs,and catch a beautiful sunset.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603222,"Well well well...where do I start?  
The winds continued to grow into the night. Sustaining winds of probably 40MPH at all times. I stayed curled up in my sleeping bag like a cocoon, and was warm enough.  
 At one point I felt something hit me and I popped up.  Hugs was shouting a few expletives and said that was her sleep pad. She got up to potty and the wind took it. It was part way down the mountain. In the dark it looked far away, but it really wasn’t too far and she was able to get it back.  
I rearranged my backpack to be partially on my sleep pad and made sure things were battened down.  Morning could not come soon enough!  
I woke at 6am to no visible sunrise at all. We were in a cloud. Needless to say my down sleeping bag was wet from the cloud mist. And the winds were still raging.  I covered back up until 7.  
The sun didn’t find its way out of the clouds. Because of the wind I couldn’t light my stove to make coffee. Hugs just threw her gear into her pack and left. We planned to meet at the first place she found to cook breakfast.  My OCD made me pack up the way I always do, so I was behind her.  
Forgetting we still had some climbing to summit Saddleback, I was completely unprepared for the huge boulder in my way. I said “ok, let the climbing begin”. There were about 5 big climbs before I reached Hugs. She had not been able to cook, but we carried on together.  In the misty wind we reached the summit of Saddleback Mountain at 4116ft elevation.  
On our way down we met some section hikers who said from there to our destination is a cakewalk...and it was!  
Once I finished my descent I had a lovely carpet of pine needles! My knees were grateful. 
Before long birds were chirping, the sun was shining, and I found myself hiking beside a beautiful pond.  This day became beautiful!  
Hugs was already ahead because I stopped for a potty break. Then I stopped for water from a creek that flowed into the pond.  Then a NOBO (Cesar) recognized me from way back in Tennessee. He had received some trail magic from Papa Big Swig and he was still thankful today!  I barely recognized him, he’s lost a lot of weight. 
Speaking of weight. Men usually lose a lot on the trail, but women don’t. We gain muscle. I had the opportunity to weigh myself this week, and I’ve lost only 11 pounds.  That being said, my body has significantly shape shifted!   I don’t even recognize it anymore!  
I caught Hugs at the shelter. The same one we were trying to get to yesterday.  Since the day and terrain had become so nice we decided to extend our mileage.  Papa Big Swig was picking us up at a road only a mile or so away.  So I texted him the change of plans, but it would not go through. No service. We never regained cell service so when we reached our road an hour and a half early, we just had to wait.  It was a short day, could have done so much more

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603272,"As Hugs and I exited the vehicle it began to sprinkle. Our hike started going UP.  The truth is, if it’s raining, going UP is by far easier than going DOWN.  By the looks of the forest, it must have rained all night in the mountains.  
The forest was lovely today!  Other than a few rocks and roots the trail was just a good ole hiking trail!  No mountain climbing today. Much of the path was Pine straw carpet.  My joints love that!  
I really enjoyed the new colors in the forest today. Maple leaves are turning red and gold. I saw yellow elm leaves, and the ferns are turning orange.  The plant that’s turning a plum color was scattered in there too.  All of those colors mixed in with evergreen pines made a beautiful mural! 
There was a lot of moose poop today!  In one 5 yards area there were several piles. I wondered if moose run in herds like cows or deer?  I’m sure all those piles didn’t come from one moose.  But as usual, I had all the evidence...no moose.  
Shortly after the moose poop extravaganza I found myself face to face with Groucho!  I have not seen him since Damascus. His wife was slack packing him because of a neck injury. That’s all healed now and he’s very close to finishing!  We had a nice talk, wished each other well and went on our ways.  
I was ahead all morning doing my usual hike in silence. I really enjoy listening to the sounds of nature.  And that’s what I got from a very aggravated squirrel!  I must have come too close to his stash or maybe a nest. I’m not sure but boy I got an earful of chatters and squeals! 
A pond came up on my left.  I walked to the shore to look for moose.  There was a boat pulled up on land, but not a person around.  No moose either.  But there was mist coming up off the pond, and that was beautiful.  
Hugs caught up to me about that time and we walked on together.  In a short distance standing there on the trail was a Spruce Grouse. AKA the black and grey chicken!   I took a lot of pictures, they really do look like a chicken of sorts. 
We walked together past another pond to a blue blaze. The blue blaze took us to our lunch spot, Sabboth Day Pond Lean-to.  We took about a 20 minute break and headed out to finish up our hike. 
With a mile left to go we learned there was magic at our end point today.  I was praying for pop.  When we got there my prayers were answered!  Orange Crush and a Little Debbie’s snack cake!  Four angels were there serving up hot food too if we wanted it.  We chose not to eat hot because Papa Big Swig was there to pick us up. 
Papa Big Swig had spent his day moving our camper to New Hampshire.  I can’t believe it won’t be much longer before I cross that state line!  
We picked up a couple of hikers who were hitchhiking into town and dropped them off at a BnB before going to the campsite. 
As we pulled into the campgrounds I could see Big Kahuna! There he was pitching his tent!  Happy happy happy!  My trail brother is back!  He’s here to help Papa Big Swig with logistics, and to get us girls through the Whites. He knows them inside and out!  It’s sooo good to his smiling face again!

Big Kahuna was our shuttle driver this morning.  He may not be hiking, but he still makes sure us girls are okay.  Papa Big Swig managed the home front today.  I feel so fortunate to have both of their support in this adventure.  
It dawned on me this morning that I have hiked past 1600 miles now.  Wow!   I have about 570 miles to go. That seems so little compared to the  2190.9 I had ahead of me back in March.  
When we got out of the vehicle our trail angels from yesterday pulled in behind us.  Every day Gregg & Geri set out a cooler of magic for the hikers and one day a week they cook. Today they dropped off a cooler. We talked a good 10 minutes or so before our hike began.   
The trail started going UP., and it was obvious we were going to be climbing today. Boulder climbing! It’s funny because I grab pine branches or roots to help pull myself up, then I apologize to the tree!  
Once we got up over the boulders in the beginning it wasn’t too bad. There was some actual plain old hiking at times. More rocks and roots than I like, but it was do-able.  
I watched two chipmunks playing around, then two squirrels were just going crazy chasing each other!  It was the cutest thing!  Later Hugs told me she had seen the squirrels too. 
We continued hiking up Bemis Mountain.  There was a view not quite all the way up. I stopped for a picture.  When Hugs arrived we decided to eat our lunch right there. 
Recently during lunch we’ve been getting chilled. We both work up a sweat hiking UP, then when we stop our sweat begins to evaporate and we get chilled. It’s much cooler at those high elevations.  So we get moving again pretty quickly before hypothermia sets in.  Hypothermia is a genuine concern in the mountains. 
After lunch we continued our hike up Bemis Mountain. The summit was 3564ft elevation.  There was no view up there, but the hiking was nice!   
Coming down was not overly difficult. Of course there was a bog.  Boardwalks are in place, but lots of them are decaying or broken.  Hugs said we always take pictures of the pretty new boardwalks, but they are the exception not the rule. So today I took a photo of one that better represents reality.  
The path started going UP again.  There were more climbs up OLD BLUE mountain.  I love the name!  My dads best and favorite hound dog was called Old Blue!  We hiked up 3600ft to the summit.  
Coming down I saw big moose tracks!  All of this evidence, and no moose!  
 About then a NOBO came along.  He stopped and said “I know you”.  It was Wicked!  He sheltered with us at McAfee Knob!   
The rest of the way down the mountain was an even mix of pine straw carpet and boulders. Almost all the way down I slipped on a wet rock and...down went McGinney!
Big Kahuna picked us up...

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603428,"Big Kahuna was our morning shuttle driver again today.  I usually ride up front, but today I rode in the back seat. I kicked my feet up and fell fast asleep. I woke to Big Kahuna saying “look there’s an eagle!”  I opened my eyes in time to see it landing up on a tree limb.  Eagles are THE most beautiful bird I’ve ever seen. They truly are majestic. 
Seylor Jo was wagging her tail when I invited her to come with me today.  We had planned a NERO, so I felt confident it wouldn’t be too much for her.  
This day started going UP. I climbed up Moody Mountain to 1942.7ft.  It was windy and cold with mist in the air.   When I made it to a ledge with a view I could see rain clouds rolling in.  It wouldn’t be long until rain hit.  The view was still fantastic! 
My descent was nice. Seylor and I took it slow. It was steep in a few places but there were iron steps placed into the rock. Sometimes they were in places they weren’t even needed.  Nonetheless I appreciate the ones I used. 
At the bottom there was a randomly placed picnic table. My next UP was a biggie so I decided to sit there and take in some fuel while I wait for Hugs. I had a Twinkie and Seylor had a Jumbone.  
The mist turned into drops and soon it was pouring rain. I couldn’t wait any longer. Now I wasn’t just cold, I was wet and cold. I had to keep moving.  
About half way up I saw Hugs behind me. Explained I just couldn’t wait any longer and kept moving. Hugs voice was quivering...she was really cold. 
Shortly after I reached the summit I came to a Lean-to. About 6 hikers had already taken refuge.  There was standing room only under the awning. Seylor and I ducked under to wait for Hugs. When she arrived, she walked on past saying she was going to keep on going.  Her voice was shaky and she was obviously miserable.  We all were.  The winds were relentless as the cold rain poured. 
Seylor took off with Hugs. I threw on my rain poncho and followed.  Hugs was nearly in tears when I caught up with her.  She’s an Arizona girl and being cold is not something her body is use to.  
It really all becomes a blur from there.  I was able to get a text out to the guys. They knew we were going to need heat and don’t be late. I had a real fear of hypothermia for both of us.  
I remember that I had to pee. My hands were frozen and I couldn’t snap my pants. I was able to zip them and went on like that.  Hugs was unable to zip anything. I could tell she was getting worse.  It’s just soooo much colder in the mountains.  
I tried to contact the guys again so they would come into the woods and bring a blanket for Hugs. They could grab her poles and help her out. Unfortunately there was no longer any cell service.   I was of no use. If I stopped to help her, I was going to very quickly fall into the same situation Hugs was in. I had about a mile to go, so Seylor and I ran down a to get help. 
Papa Big Swig took Seylor, Big Kahuna took a blanket and went into the woods. I had to get myself warmed up. Papa Big Swig had brought dry socks and shoes for me. I peeled off my outer layers of clothing and sat in the heated SUV. 
Hugs was closer behind me than I thought because it was only a few minutes before they came out.  She was shaking and crying, and frozen.  We’re both medical people, we knew enough to get the wet clothing off of her. So wrapped up in a blanket and jackets we took Hugs home. Our heater stayed on blast!  
I’m happy to report that Hugs turned around quickly. If not for Big Kahuna and Papa Big Swig this outcome could have been very different.  As it stands, we will hike another day.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603492,"Today we chose to  leapfrog up to Grafton NotchState Park. This was strategic because today will be a cool but sunny day and we wanted to do the Mahoosac’s in good weather. Mahoosuc Notch is known as the hardest mile on the entire A.T.   
The trail started UP Old Speck Mountain at 4173 ft elevation.  It was a big UP, but the trail was easily managed. I mean, I worked up a sweat and all, but the hard climbing was minimal. 
It was very cold this morning.  A section hiker told me 33 degrees, but the sun was shining and I was comfortable. I spent the morning  hiking a long while beside a mountain spring.  The sound of moving water is so soothing to me  .  
Almost to the top I found a rock to sit on with a view.  I enjoyed that until Hugs caught up.  We did the next 0.5 together. 
There were awesome views today!  The A.T. made a turn 0.3 miles before the summit of Old Speck. Hugs and I chose to hike the 0.3. I climbed up the fire tower and was in awe of this vast land as I looked around.  I wish it were possible to take a 360 photo.  
I came down from the tower, and we ate lunch right there. Just a few more miles to go to Mahoosuc Notch.  
The DOWN was steep, really steep.  My poor knees are beginning to rebel against this hike.  
I ran into a brother and sister duo hiking NOBO.  I met them back on Tray Mountain sooo long ago.  Anyway, they are in their 70’s!  I am so impressed!  She said it took them 6 hours to get through Mahoosuc Notch. That’s a one mile stretch only! 
We started going UP to Mahoosuc Arm 3765ft.  The views were never ending! 
Going down was very steep. It was 1.5 miles of leaning on my poles and shuffling my feet.  A few times I was grabbing tree branches or roots.  As I was saying to myself one and a half miles of this business, Hugs went down.  I yelled are you okay!  She replied “no”. Uh oh!  It felt like it took me forever to get to her, and just as I reached her I went down on the same wet roots that took her down.  I was not injured. She hurt her coccyx...badly.  
It took a minute, but she shook it off and we set our sites on the Mahoosuc Notch. Labeled “THE HARDEST” mile on the whole trail.   I was excited about it, but Hugs had pain with every step.  
We met some section hikers just coming out of the Notch. The guy asked me if I was good at yoga. He said they twisted and turned every which way, but they got it done in 2.5 hours. 
We put our poles in our packs and started the “hands on” journey! So they weren’t kidding!  Literally we had to contort our bodies up, down, and around these boulders.  It was very tricky!  I actually enjoyed the challenge!  In some crazy way it was fun!  Poor Hugs was not having a good time, but good time or not, she was there to help me up a large boulder.  I helped her too.  
Three hours and eight minutes later we hiked out of the Notch. Whew!  What an adventure!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603563,"Since I did a leapfrog yesterday, I had to go back and fill in the gap.  12.2 miles with a couple of big climbs. I had no hiking partner today...she’s still recovering from yesterday’s fall. 
I walked beside a creek for quite a while, then I crossed it.  I crossed several creeks today, all of them on boulders.  
Then I started going UP to Bald Pate Mountain East Peak at 3790ft elevation.  
On the way up, I noticed Spruce Grouse were everywhere!  They are a most unique bird!  If you haven’t seen or heard one, I recommend checking them out on YouTube.  
Other than grouse I saw toads, squirrels, and chipmunks. The weather is changing, and the toads must be cold.  They’re moving much slower. One tried to hop away and literally did some kind of awkward backflip/side roll.  He got back on his feet and sat there about 3 inches from where he started.  
Just before my lunch break I crossed paths with NOLA!   She has 3 days left of her hike.  We had some pleasant dialogue and she sent a hug to Hugs!   You know I giggled inside...again!  Even still, I’m super happy for NOLA she’s about to check a bucket list!  
I stopped at Frye Notch Lean-to for lunch. Chatted with a couple of NOBO thru’s and ate my chicken salad sandwich.  That’s one of the joys of slack packing, fresh food!  
Soon enough I continued my climb up Baldpate.  Several areas were steep. At one location a rope and ladder was placed to help get up over a huge ledge.  I was so thankful for that!  
Baldpate has two peaks.  It took forever to summit the first one, but the payoff was fabulous!  This land is so vast and so breathtaking.  There are no words really.  I took my time. Time well spent. 
I climbed down the first peak rather quickly.  It took good effort getting up the next one. Then I started the 3 mile trek down.  Aching knees, aching knees, aching knees!!! 
Some parts were ok with pine straw but mostly I had to hunt and peck and carefully place each foot. It took much longer than the climb up. 
At one point I heard a growl off to my right. I looked, but there was no large animal like a bear or a moose.(if a moose can even growl) so I hiked on and it happened two more times over about a 50 yards space.  I never saw anything, and it eventually stopped.  
With about a half mile left to go I heard Papa Big Swig and our doggies. He hand delivered me a soda on the trail!  Gotta love that guy! 
He had our little dog on a leash. We usually let them run on trail. I asked why? He said a local told him she had just seen a coyote about 20 minutes before right in this area. Poodle sized dogs are a coyote meal. 
Hmmmm could a coyote have been growling at me?  I’ve seen/heard plenty of coyotes on this journey, but they all keep their distance.   Who knows?

We all went out for breakfast this morning in “Berlin”.  It was a mom & Pop diner and I had the best pancakes ever!  
Other than that I’ve been pretty lazy today. My knees are still a little mad at me, so I stayed off of them. Besides walking the dogs a couple of times.  
Our camper has been parked here at White Birches Campground for probably a week now. We are parked close to the bathhouse, which is always my request. So until today I’ve only seen our site and the amenities.  That’s because I hike, shower, eat, sleep...repeat! 
Walking the dogs all the way through the campground today was so enlightening.  First of all the place is filled with those tall white trees that peel their bark.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603741,"Big Kahuna cooked all of us breakfast this morning. It was delicious! Then he drove Hugs and I to our starting point. Papa Big Swig had a business call.  
It was almost an hour drive to the blue blaze that would take us back to the A.T.  
The Gambler by Kenny Rogers came on the radio and it made me think of dad. He loved country music, and he liked a little gambling too.  
The blue blaze was 2.4 miles to the trail.  That’s 2.4 miles we cannot count on today’s mileage.  That’s the price we pay for slack packing.  
We hiked beside a stream a good distance, and eventually had to cross it.  We knew this because it’s the same blue blaze we exited from after hiking the Notch. However, after two days of rain this cute little creek had become a raging river!  We could not step on rocks to get across.  After some contemplation, off came our socks and shoes. 
I went first. The water was quite cold, but it actually felt good on these aching feet.  I was across quickly, and Hugs was close behind. We used my bandana to dry our feet. 
With our socks and shoes back on we were moving up the trail in no time, but a few hundred yards up trail, we had to cross that same creek again! This time we were able to keep our shoes on. 
Soon enough the A.T. was under my feet and we began our trek up Fulling Fill Mountain to 3395ft elevation. The beginning of this UP was not any better than the Mahoosuc Notch.  We did some serious boulder climbing. 
In a couple of places iron rungs were embedded in boulders to help us climb up.  So thankful for the ATC and all they do for us! 
Once I was on my feet and walking, around  the path was nice. Sunshine was coming through the trees in places. It was peaceful hiking up there, and beautiful.  Then I reached the summit.  For fun I had timed myself. It took exactly 56 minutes. That’s pretty good for me.  I was impressed with myself!  
It was windy and cold at the summit. I took some photos and decided to hike on to a lean-to. It was only 0.5 miles down and I would wait for Hugs there.  
As I came to the lean-to I got a friendly “hello” from a hiker named Cordial. He had his gear and clothing laid out on a tent pad waiting for the sun to dry them. Cordial was caught in Mahoosuc Notch last night during the rain.  He had to stay on a ledge overnight.  Everything got soaked!  It must have been extremely cold because he said he started making goodbye videos on his phone.  By God’s grace he was spared and in good humor today. 
Hugs arrived, ate her lunch, and moved on. I was still finishing my lunch. I shared a Twinkie with Cordial before moving on.  
Climbing up to the Goose Eye peaks was challenging at times.   Once I caught up with Hugs, I took a moment to look behind me. I love to see where I came from. The thought of having been all the way up in those mountains feels surreal. 
I passed Hugs and began to systematically knock out the Goose Eye Peaks. First was North Peak at 3675ft elevation. One down!  On to East Peak! 
The trek down North Peak was a little muddy at times, but not bad. Soon enough I took a turn and stared going UP Goose Eye East Peak at 3790ft elevation. It wasn’t long before a rock slab that went almost straight up for about 50ft was in front of me. This is NOT good!  The rock was wet and there was no footing. After several attempts I had to come up with a plan B, or I could be seriously hurt. Eventually I bushwhacked around the side and safely made it to the top.  I waited up there until I saw Hugs. This area is dangerous and there was no point in her trying to maneuver that huge slab. Once she was up, the rest of the climb was gravy.  
On to Goose Eye West Peak at 3870ft.  This peak was a challenge as the boulder scrambles reminded me of Mahoosuc Notch.  More of the same going down.  
But down I went and crossed over the state line into New Hampshire. So long Maine, you were great!   
I waited for Hugs at the state line and congratulated a few NOBO’s as they entered Maine. What an exciting time for them!  
Hugs and I started up Mount Success. About 3/4ths of the way up we took a blue blaze to make our exit for the day.  It was another 2.4 miles we cannot count.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603747,"It was just me again today. Papa Big Swig drove me in the rain to my blue blaze starting point. Another 2.4 miles I’ll hike back up Mt Success to get on trail. Those miles will not count.  Neither will the elevation gain. But trust me, my body counts it all!
 Extra mileage or not, I started this day with a renewed burst of energy. This always happens when I cross into a new state.  
I enjoyed my blue blaze this morning. These fall colors are a sight to behold.  I also followed fresh moose tracks for the entire last mile. You guessed it...NO MOOSE!  
Shortly after getting back on trail I summited Mount Success at 3365ft elevation.  I actually climbed it twice.  Once yesterday to get to my blue blaze and again today to get to the summit. Double the fun!  
My Mount Success view was cloudy, but pretty awesome! By now the rain had stopped and I watched the clouds moving across all of the mountains in my view.  I could see peaks here and there, and it was pretty.  
Coming down Mount Success was a nice grade in the beginning.  There were many boggy areas though. One wrong step and my left boot was ankle deep in mud.  It wasn’t too long before my right boot was too.  I just kept sloshing along until I came to a steep rock slab slanted down.  I did my usual grab a pine branch and try to move slowly, but I had no control. In the end I bushwhacked around it.  I hate doing that. 
Just before I reached the bottom I saw a familiar face coming towards me. It was Freight Train!  I’ve thought about him many times out here. He’s such a good kid, and only 3 or 4 miles from Maine! He’s got about 265 miles to go. Get it Freight Train! 
We talked way too long really.(but it was nice) I was starving and about a mile from a lean-to.   I hurried on down and kept my eyes open for the blue blaze. Eventually I knew I had to have gone a mile but never saw the blue blaze. One quick Guthook’s check and realized I was 0.3 miles past it. UGH!!!  With all of this rain everything is soaked in the woods. I finally found a suitable rock and used my sit-upon.  It was a quick, damp, cool, and uncomfortable lunch.  
There were white flying insects all over today. They were like microscopic moths. Sometimes I was cautious taking a deep breath for fear I would breathe them in.  They were worse around the muddy bogs, and there were a lot of muddy bogs! 
The trail after lunchtime was pretty much a solid muddy bog for 3 or 4 miles. The trail was also obscure in several places. I had to figure out my direction too many times for my liking. The only cool thing I saw during those miles was a little chipmunk. He was proudly carrying a completely intact BIG white mushroom through the woods. He was struggling.  I felt like I should applaud his efforts...so I did! 
I had a lot of UPs today. I’m not good at exactly calculating the amount of feet I climbed, but I know this is THE most I’ve ever climbed in one day. I’ve done more miles, but on easier terrain.  Terrain matters.  
Speaking of terrain, it did improve just as nightfall came.  The sun sets so early now.  I pulled out my headlamp and prepared for darkness.  I was on my way up for one last view, and got it just in time!  These views are just glorious!   
I started down and flipped on my light. There were lots of fallen orange and brown leaves right there. There’s a definite scent from fall leaves on the ground. I love it. Sweet nostalgia. 
As the last drops of light were disappearing I listened to birds saying goodnight.  I heard the most unique bird call I’ve ever heard. It sounded like a young girl was startled by a mouse or something. Woooo! Wooo! Then the forest fell silent and I could not see beyond the perimeters of my headlight. 
I embrace night hiking.  My dad was a hunter and he hunted at night.  I couldn’t tell you how many nights I’ve spent out in the woods.  Without concern or fear I just kept on hiking. I had about 1.5 miles left to go when Papa Big Swig sent me a text. He was hiking in to meet me with a soda!  Yep!  My hero!  
I had about a half mile left when we met. I guzzled my orange crush and lead us back down the path he came up. There was a campfire burning below. It was  drawing me down like a beacon. I jokingly yelled to the hikers below that I was coming for supper.  That’s when I heard “Blue Raccoon is that you?”  Yes, who are you?  “It’s Reflex!”  Yay! I hustled on down.  She’s hiking with Stranger, stayed NOBO, and will be in Maine tomorrow!  Rock on sister! She’s another really awesome young person I’ve met on trail.  
I gave them what water and snacks I had left. A little embarrassed I grabbed my tiny daypack and said goodbye.  She laughed and took a picture!  Okay, I know I’m princess hiking!  
Planning to leapfrog up for Mount Washington tomorrow. Can’t wait!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603829,"The day started with full intentions of hiking Mount Washington from the summit to Pinkham Notch.  We were first in line to get onto the Mount Washington Auto Road.  It opens at 8am. 
The drive up was scary!  There are no side rails on the narrow winding road.  Hugs and I sat in the back, so I just closed my eyes.  We stopped once for photos but I didn’t participate in that.  I just wanted to have my feet on the ground permanently. 
When I finally did get out of the vehicle I immediately knew today would not be the day for hiking Mount Washington!  
Mount Washington at 6288ft above sea level is THE WINDIEST PLACE ON EARTH!  Yesterday it was the windiest place... on steroids!  We were in the clouds making everything misty.  It was 36 degrees but felt much colder.  I was not dressed appropriately for this.  
So this day became a fun tourist day!  Big Kahuna has been here before. He made sure we all got to experience everything offered. 
We started in the primary gift shop.  It was fun choosing a T-shirt and post cards.  There’s an actual U.S. Post Office up there! It’s tiny, but it’s there.  
Somehow Big Kahuna managed to get a backside tour for us in the Mount Washington Weather Observatory.   Extremely interesting!   It’s the oldest weather observatory in the country.  Our tour guide was Zach a new grad with a degree in meteorology. He’s there as an intern.  They collect data 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  We saw all of the instruments, their living quarters, and the elements they face every day while collecting this data.  It was an awesome experience!  
There is also a museum. I learned about the very first 4 men who started the observatory.  How they maneuver in the snow and ice, and much more. For example the fairly large amount of the deaths that have occurred on Mount Washington.  I wondered how many were hikers?!? Yikes!  
Speaking of hikers.  Remember Hugs had a hard fall just before Mahoosuc Notch?  Well she’s still in pain.  This might be TMI , but she has a very large bruise across her entire derrière.  I’m concerned something is broken, and so is she.   I’m not sure I’ll get to keep my hiking partner.  Keep Hugs in your prayers.  
From the observatory we went to Pinkham Notch and shopped some more!  A total tourist day!  
I will try to hike again tomorrow.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603877,"There are some days when I cannot wait to write my journal entry.  This is one of them.  
Again we attempted the leapfrog up from my last exit on US RT 2 to the summit of Mount Washington. The plan is to hike down Mount Washington northbound to Pinkham Notch, then choose another good weather day to hike UP the south side.  This hike will leave me with a 22 miles gap to fill in. 
So our day began with a quick stop in the gift shop. Hugs was looking for a ski mask of sorts.  In the end we each just tied a bandana over our face.  It worked. 
On the way out we ran into Chuckles. He’s a thruhiker of seasons past, but he was there enjoying the Whites. He slept on Mount Washington last night and caught some amazing sunrise photos!  
It was not as windy as yesterday, but still plenty windy.  There was Rime Ice everywhere making the rocks slick and difficult to maneuver over. Big Kahuna lead us girls part way down where it was more safe. He checked over our gear, gave me his sunglasses, and sent us on our way. He still takes care of us. I miss hiking with him. 
Less than 15 minutes into my hike I knew this day would be my best hike ever! Being above tree line, the views were endless!  Literally eternal 360 degrees views!  I could see for hundreds of miles!  Awestruck is the only word to describe it. 
This hike was hard on Hugs. Since her last big fall she’s taken a few extra zeros, but her pain is obvious. She is forced to move at a slothier pace. I felt so bad for her, but she said she wasn’t  about to go home not having hiked the Whites. And so she did!  Hurting or not, she soaked it all up just the same as me.  
I was ahead of Hugs all day, but I kept her within sight or no more than a half mile or so behind me.  When I thought I should wait, I would just sit on a rock and pick my view.  This is the life!  
As I was hiking I began to stare out at the vastness of the land. Lost in my own thoughts I was singing “This land is your land, this land is my land”...  My dad would have loved this day! I really miss him.  I slowly hiked on down to the bottom of Mount Washington. It had taken about 4.5 hours. Not bad. 
I waited outside Madison Hut for Hugs. This Hut is closed for the season but usually offers up hot soup for a minimal fee.  Today I would have a cold pork chop sandwich for lunch. There were 3 other day hikers lunching outside with me.  We shivered, conversed, and ate while we looked up at Mount Madison. She will be our next big challenge at 5367ft elevation. 
After Hugs arrived and ate a few bites of food we began our journey UP Madison’s steep ascent.  I was surprised by how easily I managed the climb up. It’s possible that I’m getting pretty good at this mountain climbing business!  
Big Kahuna had warned us in advance of her very steep descent. He was right.  It was far trickier than climbing up.  The wind and temperature changes added to our challenge. On one side of the mountain it was hot and sunny. On the other side it was windy and cold. I began a series of systematically buttoning up my flannel shirt and throwing on my jacket, then taking off my jacket and unbuttoning my shirt. This happened with every twist going down.  Madison was a challenge, but since conquering Abol Slide,  It felt more like a quiz than a test.  Our only nonnegotiable today was that we MUST be down Madison at least into tree line before dark. We were. 
Darkness came fast. We had planned a 9pm pick up at Pinkham Notch but that changed quickly. Hugs had taken 3 more falls today.  No real injuries, but the jolts just add to what is already injured, and fall #3 did its number. I know what that’s like, I’ve been there.   
With headlamps on I stayed closer to Hugs, feeling bad that I could not help her.  We had 5.8 miles to go and it would take every bit of 5 or 6 hours to get to our extraction point. Every move she made caused pain.  
I personally love night hiking. However, it is not Hugs’ favorite thing. All was well until we found ourselves about a half mile off trail.  Losing trail does happen easier in the dark.  We can’t really look around for trail options because we use our lights to watch every single rocky step we take.  It was during this misadventure when we realized our Guthook’s apps had gone crazy!   Uh oh!  This is our primary navigation tool. 
We hiked back UP the 1/2 mile we had just hiked down and redirected ourselves with limited use from Guthook’s.  There must have been major cloud coverage messing with the satellite. Similar occurrences happened at least 3 more times over the next two hours.  One time I landed myself right in the middle of a stream because of it...well, it and my own impatience.  
I’m not sure what the temp was, but I could see my breath.  Hugs stayed dry(one good thing for her) and I sloshed on in the cold with completely soaked through boots. Oddly the cold feels really good on my feet.  I just don’t like added weight from WET boots.
So we continued our trek.  At one point we heard Big Kahuna yelling for us. We yelled back but he didn’t hear. He was on the wrong trail looking for us, but had not yet figured that out. We were worried that he was worried!  
By now it was after 11pm. Miraculously the satellite phone started going through. I regained cell service and Guthook’s was back on track. The whole big mess was settled. Papa Big Swig knew we were safe, Big Kahuna did too.  Just 2 miles or so to go. Which makes it a very late extraction because Hugs really can’t just “GO”. Despite hurting so badly, she really kept a great attitude through it all. 
So we kept moving forward as we had all day. Exhaustion was setting in after 15+ hours of hiking. I would often times stop to wait by sitting on a rock. Eventually she would catch me and the same routine would start again. 
That’s what happened next. She had just caught up to me. I started walking ahead and hadn’t gone too far when I heard a grunt. Mind you when night hiking I just shine my light down and watch my steps. But this grunt made me look up. Right there beside me less than a foot away was a moose!  I had already hiked past it’s rear end and was almost up to its head!  Now I’m usually “G” rated, but some moments in life make you lose your morals!  This was one of those moments! I looked up at Hugs who already saw it and yelled “shit!! It’s a big ass moose”!!! 
Upon her instructions I ran back to her...right past it’s hind legs!  She was sooo scared!  I was thinking this is the coolest thing I’ve ever experienced!  Using our headlamps and flashlights we could see he was eating leaves from shrubs along the trail. I started snapping photos. My flash wouldn’t work. Hugs tried to get some too. 
We waited for him to move on.  And waited, and waited...  he was happy right there.  At the same time we could hear another moose off in the brush. We never saw it, but it was there making the same grunts as the one in front of us. Hugs was doubly scared!  Just then, it began to lightly snow.
We decided to bushwhack around the moose on the trail. I went first as Hugs was clinging to me.  Every step I took she said “don’t leave me”!  At one point I took a step forward just to get pulled back by my backpack!  It was comical!  I was having the time of my life!  So was Hugs, despite being scared beyond reason! 
Mr. Moose grunted one more time as we passed his eating space. Other than that, I really don’t think he even cared we were there.  
We giggled the whole way to Pinkham Notch. It was well after midnight when we saw Big Kahuna waiting there patiently. We couldn’t wait to tell our story!!! Not ONE of our photos turned out.  I told Hugs nobody’s going to believe this one! 
But we know!

It was after 1am this morning before we got back from hiking.  Hugs and I both took a bath.  It was 4am before I finally started dozing off.  Needless to say this day is a zero!  
I woke up for the last time and stayed up around noon.  I haven’t done that in years!  Yesterday’s hike was so much fun, but today my body feels like I’ve been run over! 
Hugs was already out the door by the time I started moving.  She came back laughing still about my New Hampshire moose. Then she gifted me a nice big mug that has a moose on it, and says New Hampshire!  I’ll cherish it forever. Probably my most favorite gift she’s ever gotten me. 
She’s been hiking every other day or so with me. I hope she heals up quickly to get that pain gone!  
Papa Big Swig cooked dinner.  We had salmon with potatoes and mixed veggies.  Strawberry Shortcake with extra whipped cream for dessert!  Yummy!  
One quick game of cards and we were all off to bed.  
Tomorrow will be another zero. The weather is not cooperating for mountain climbing.

We played a game of hearts in the afternoon. As usual Big Kahuna won!  It was just a nice relaxing afternoon.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604003,"Hugs and I started out together. Papa Big Swig and Big Kahuna walked us part way in. There was a fairly large creek crossing early on where we lost Papa Big Swig. Big Kahuna went a little further until we started UP.  
It was misty outside.  Every rock, boulder, and tree root was slippery. Hugs and I carefully began making our way up.  I knew immediately that she was in pain again. But we were beside a most beautiful waterfall and she was enjoying that.  We crossed a wooden bridge with a hold rope, and back to wet boulders. Finally, with tears in her eyes, Hugs said she was calling Papa Big Swig to have someone come back and get her.  
With tears in my own eyes I watched her make her way back down what we had just climbed up.  She promised to text when she was safely in the car....she did. 
On my own again today I continued the climb up Mount Moosilauke at 4802 ft elevation.  The entire morning I had a series of cascading waterfalls beside me. Music to my ears, and a sight to behold! 
The trail was actually a notch or a rockslide.  Climbing up was tedious. I zig-zagged right then left to take a step forward. Eventually I made some ground. 
The rain stopped. I was up high enough now that the sun could shine through sparse pines easily.  It was warm. I quickly shed my outer layer of clothing, and wished I had not worn long johns.  
My trail turned away from the waterfalls, but I could hear a flowing spring below the rocks and boulders I was climbing on.  Every now and and then I saw water rushing below.  
The trees began to dwarf as I climbed higher until eventually there were no more trees. It was warm above tree line.  Warm, but cloud covered.  I followed  cairn piles through the haze to the top.  
Yay I made it!   
There was a local on the summit eating lunch.  I joined him. He’s hiked the A.T. all the way to New York and assures me from Mt Moosilauke to NY is easy peasy hiking compared to where I’m coming from.  That’s good to know!  Except I do have a couple of gaps to fill in...in the whites.  6 more hiking days in the rough stuff.  A young French couple arrived as I was finishing up my lunch. 
The beginning down grade was good for about a half mile. Soon it became steep, wet, rocky terrain. I plugged away slowly. I could feel every step in my knees. They are so very angry with me!  
When I reached the bottom of Moosilauke I had about 2 miles to my extraction point.  The trail has a few rolling hills. Then it opened up to a small field with lavender flowers. It was a nice hike. 
I made it to my pick up location about 40 minutes early.  With no cell service, I just waited.  Big Kahuna picked me up and he had Hugs with him.  
Hugs wants to hike the rest of Mount Washington with me, then she’ll be calling it a day for now.  I’ll miss her, but I completely understand.

",Kinsman Notch ,"Oct 03, Wed",9.50
Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604076,"I was up at 5:30 this morning to get an early start.  My plan was for 16+ miles today and it’s suppose to rain this afternoon. There was some confusion getting to my starting point so I wasn’t on trail until 7:40.  I brought my rain gear.   
After hiking a 1.2 mile blue blaze to the A.T.  Hugs and Big Kahuna sent me on my way. Hugs is taking another much needed zero.  
Papa Big Swig stayed back to pack up the Time Share.  Also to get our dogs out of boarding.  They were not allowed at the Time Share. He will have the camper set up before I’m off trail today.  We’ll be back to cramped living, but it’s warm and dry.  
My hike started UP North Kinsman Mountain 4293ft above sea level.   The trail was wet and rocky. In places it was steep, but otherwise a fairly nice grade. 
I watched busy chipmunks hustle around the forest.  Golden leaves carpeted my path. I enjoyed watching more and more of them fall.   It was snowing leaves!  
Then I came to Cascade Brook. This brook was swollen over from all the rain that’s been happening. It was swift and dangerous!  I could not get across on boulders. Eventually I took off my boots and socks. Using trekking poles for balance I made my way across. My feet were nearly swept out from under me at one point, but I made it.  
From the bank on the other side I hiked on to Lonesome Lake Hut. Clouds covered the lake, but it was beautiful. In the Whites there are “Huts” with full functioning kitchens, bathrooms, and bunk houses.  Many of them are closed for the season right now, but this particular Hut is open year around.  When I walked in it felt like a step back on time. The floors and walls were hand crafted from wood. The kind of quality woodwork you never see anymore. There’s also wooden picnic tables and benches. They’re extra long and obviously hand crafted too.  The Hut offered a small variety of food. I chose homemade apricot scone and a hot cup of ginger tea.  
It was there where I met Mason.  He’s a thru-hiker who flipped up from Pennsylvania. So he’s southbound now like me, but today he’s doing a NOBO flip. He’s navigating through the Whites the same as I am...all depending on the weather.  When I left the Hut, I was directionally turned around.  Thank goodness for my new friend Mason!  He set me straight before I hiked a mile in the wrong direction.  
Once on the right path I had 1.7 miles to summit South Kinsman Mountain at 4358ft elevation.  The ascent was steep!  I spent most of the 1.7 miles bouldering.  Well, I actually spent most of my day bouldering on wet slippery boulders.  There was no view at the summit,  just clouds.  The wind started blowing much stronger.  Rain is coming! 
Descending South Kinsman was steep again. I did enjoy the fresh pine scent on the way down though!  I met a few other hikers today.  First I met Loving It and Irma.  Loving it is soon to be 75 years old. She and Irma are on a 4 day adventure. They hike 4 miles a day full packing!  Then I met Side Quest.  He’s been hiking the A.T. Since 2016.  It’s a long story, but in 3 weeks he will have completed the journey.  
Side Quest and I leap frogged each other for hours.  His Sawyer Squeeze broke and he thought he would need to go to town.  I offered to give him a ride when my hike was over today. He was considering it. Eventually I stopped at a log for lunch and he continued on.  
After lunch I prepared to start my climb up Mount Wolf 3500ft.  I passed Side Quest on my way up.  He had stopped to cooked dinner.  He said if it rains he’ll probably pitch his tent and hunker down, then thanked me for the offer.  
I hurried along. It would be nice to summit before the skies open up. Before I could summit the sprinkles started...then drops. UGH!  I stopped hiking and took my pack off to pull out my rain gear.  It was gone!  So was my flannel shirt.  They had been rolled up in an outside pocket of my pack. Who knows where they came out at?!?  I had bushwhacked a few times, bouldered, and maneuvered over/under many fallen trees.  I feared hiking tonight while wet and cold! Just like that, the rain stopped.  
The clouds rolled away, and I caught a nice view just before the summit of Mount Wolf. My only good view of the day.  Then night fell.  
With about 1.5 hours of hiking left I hurried as fast as I could. It was cold and I had nothing to layer up with anymore. The boulders were even more slippery as the nighttime mist began collecting on them. My feet slipped out from under me more than once. I’m thankful for no injuries!  
Papa Big Swig texted that he was in the parking lot.  I had 0.5 miles to go.  Then from behind me was the light of a headlamp.  It was Side Quest!  He decided to take the ride after all.  Best of all, he had my flannel shirt and rain gear!  Thanks Side Quest!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604092,"I was up at 4am to start my last day of hiking with Hugs. The whole thing is so bittersweet.  Earlier we drove to the top and descended Mount Washington. Today we will climb up to summit Mount Washington. We will also knock out Mt Webster, Mount Jackson, and Mount Pierce along the way. These are big endeavors, but Hugs is up for it, and I’m excited to have my hiking partner back!  
We started this day with our headlamps on. Going UP! I remember looking back asking Hugs how her body is feeling. She replied “good”! Yay! A few days off and a trip to the ER has her heading in the right direction.  It’s a shame she already bought her plane ticket home... today is for sure the end of our adventures on the A.T.  
So, feeling good, we climbed Mount Webster 3910ft above sea level.  There was more bouldering, but things were much more dry today than they had been.  It was a challenging climb. At one point all I could hear was myself breathing, along with one lone bird whistle in the distance.  
The sun came up during that first climb and quickly this day was all about the views!  By the time we started our ascent of Mount Jackson Hugs had taken the lead. That’s the hiker I know!  
Mount Jackson is 4052ft elevation.  The views just kept coming!  We would find ourselves in and out of pine forest, then onto ledges with a view that just left us marveling at this great land.  Mountain sides of evergreen with big splashes of red and gold.  Autumn in the Whites is like a million dollar painting!
We spent a good amount of time on top of Mount Jackson. The Gray jay’s were up there. They ate crackers right out of our hands!  There were mountain mice scurrying around picking up any crumbs the birds dropped. It’s possible they were Shrews. I have a hard time differentiating. Whatever they are, I couldn’t believe how bold they were! 
We descended Mount Jackson and stopped at Mizpah Hut for lunch. The woodwork is incredible here too.  I’m so impressed with craftsmanship!  We ate our own lunch we had packed, but I bought a brownie for dessert. All of their goodies are homemade, and this brownie was gourmet quality!  
With an overly full belly I started up Mount Pierce. The views just kept coming!  Every now and then I just stop to take it all in.  The sun was warm on Mount Pierce and it felt good.  
We had been eyeballing Mount Washington for a few miles.  Now the time has come to begin our final ascent.  We stayed together most of the day and this would be no different. We started UP. 
Mount Washington is pretty much all rocks and boulders. There is no real “path”.  We hike from cairn to cairn until we reach the top. 
About half way up is Lake In The Clouds Hut.  This Hut is closed for the season, but it literally sits beside a lake that just happens to be on the ascension of Mount Washington. It’s beautiful. 
Papa Big Swig and Big Kahuna were waiting for us at the visitors center on the summit. We had to be there by 4:45pm because at that time everybody with a vehicle is directed off the mountain.  No exceptions. 
At 3:30pm we had 1.8 miles to go. Straight UP a steep grade incline, 100% on rocks. We can do this!  We were moving!  Both of us found ourselves gasping for air from time to time, so sometimes we’d take a quick breather and just look around.  Then we’d hustle up again towards that 6288ft summit. 
With 0.3 miles to go I began to peter out. I can easily jog 1.8 miles,  but hiking uphill at that elevation took its toll on me.  I felt dizzy. My heart was pounding. I just had to stop. Hugs continued on while I recovered.  
After a minute or two I was back to normal. My energy returned and I reached the summit with about 4 minutes to spare. I walked into the visitor center and gave a high five to my partner.  This has been a slice of life!

I woke up this morning still a little sore from my run up Mount Washington.  My left leg and knee are giving me grief.  I had a short day planned hiking to a shelter so I didn’t rush.  
Papa Big Swig dropped me off at 11am. With my full pack on I set out for an overnight in the Whites. This is the first of my two gaps I have to fill in. 
It felt strange embarking on this adventure without Hugs. I miss her already.  My solo hike started beside Rattle River going UP.  It will be a 4049ft climb to summit Mount Moriah.  
The first two miles or so was a great trail!  I listened to the river flow beside me while watching red and gold leaves fall.  It was damp and chilly, but beautiful.  
I hiked to Rattle River Shelter.  There was a group of Japanese people there. I’m sure they came to see the leaves. The locals call tourists who come this time of year “leaf peepers” or sometimes just “peepers”.  I tried to have some conversation with them, but it went nowhere.  They hiked on ahead of me.  
I finished my short break and continued UP.  I had to cross Rattle River. It looked easy enough on boulders, but my foot slipped...wet feet already!  I ended up crossing it again, but managed to stay out of the water the second time. 
With about 3.5 miles to the summit, the path got steep and rocky.  It was at this point the same Japanese group, who had turned around, crossed my path. I stepped aside so everyone could get by.  They all said “Thank You”  in very clear English.  That was nice. If I ever visit Japan I’ll be sure to learn Thank You in their language first.  
With 2.6 miles to the summit the trail turned to boulders. My clothing was soaked from water dripping off the pine trees. It rained last night to this morning.  Even though it’s not technically raining now, it sure feels like it!  
As I continued climbing my way up these wet boulders, I saw a familiar face coming towards me.  It was Chuckles!  Such a nice kid!  He sent his best to Hugs.  
I ran into Moosehead and Yogi Beast when I was near the top.  Moosehead was a thru-hiker in 2016.  They told me of what’s to come later today.  
I finally reached the summit.  4 hours and 45 minutes of climbing!  These Whites are no joke!  This is rugged terrain.  
There was no view. The clouds made for nothing but a grey misty haze.  I was drenched and cold.  
I had two miles to get to Imp Shelter. They were a rough two miles.  Down on wet rocks and boulders.  Going down is a thousand times more difficult than going up when things are wet.  I arrived at dusk.  
One other hiker passed me on the way. He’s out section hiking while his mother-in-law is visiting...I giggled a little at that!  Anyway, he was pitching his tent on a platform. I was thinking yay, I’ll have the shelter to myself!!  But, when turned the corner, there on the upper level was a tent pitched inside the shelter.  A dad with his 8 year old son Cooper were “Shamping”. That’s the lingo for shelter camping!  I took a space on the bottom.  
It turns out Cooper has now summited four 4K ft  mountains!  I’m so impressed!  I love that his dad is taking time to teach him about nature. Just like my dad did for me. Cooper doesn’t know it yet, but this is the time of his life! 
13 miles for me tomorrow and this section will be done.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604293,"I started out of Imp Shelter at 8:30 this morning.  It was later than I would like.  I didn’t get a half mile up the trail before I fell.  
Cooper and his dad were behind me.  We were talking and I was walking on a boardwalk over a little bog. The boards were slimy, and just like that, down went McGinney!  I really thought I was fine but by lunchtime I knew better. 
After making sure I was ok the two of them moved on. I continued my trek up Carter Mountain at 4530ft elevation.  
It was dreary, wet and overcast. But at exactly 10:08am the sun came out!  I could see other mountain tops peeking through the clouds, and the warmth felt good! 
I have noticed the pine trees are becoming more fragrant. I just love the smell. I also saw a Spruce Grouse on my way up. It’s been a while since I’ve seen one of them.   
I reached the summit of North Carter Mountain.  It was above the clouds so I dropped pack and rested a minute.  I could feel the sun and it was nearly dry up there.  
From the summit I began ridge hiking on to Middle Carter. The peak came fast. I was ridge hiking above tree line most of the way.  Oh how I love ridge hiking! There was no bouldering, just a few rocks and roots. Other than the new twinge in my left knee it was really an enjoyable hike.  
I had only 2 miles to South Carter summit. I decided to go there before stopping for lunch. By the time I summited South Carter, it was getting more and more difficult to bend my left knee. I dropped pack on a ledge and took a real break for lunch.  South Carter offered me a nice little space for one with a view. 
While I was sitting there a couple more hikers showed up looking for a lunch spot. They ended up on trail without a view. I felt bad, but I was there first. I watched a mouse dart in and out of little holes in the ground. These mountain mice are brazen!  Quite the scavengers!  
As I stood up to leave for Mount Hight, I knew my knee was messed up.  I had no idea how I would go 9.3 more miles to Pinkham Notch like this. I still had two good climbs left! 
In misery I began making my way to Mount Hight.  It was about a mile away at 4653ft elevation.  By the time I summited I was sure I would NOT get to Pinkham Notch today.  I texted Papa Big Swig that I would be staying another night on the trail.  I had two more miles until Carter Notch Hut. A Hut would be nice if I can get there.  I really had no choice as the Whites don’t offer much for stealth sites. 
I just had to get over Carter Dome at 4832ft, then make my way down to the Notch. Going down was far more difficult than going up.  Every step was taken cautiously and painfully. There was more bouldering going down. As I got lower I entered the clouds, so it became wet and cold again. I prayed there would be space for me at the Hut. I arrived at dusk.  
Kate the caretaker greeted me.  She offered me a bunk in my own bunk room.  Thank you,  thank you,  thank you!!! This Hut consists of 4 buildings.  The main building has a full functioning kitchen and dining room. Kate also has a room in there. It offers potable water and cookware, but you cook your own food.  There are two bunk room buildings. Each building has 4 rooms and each room has 6 bunks...with real pillows!!! The last building is the bathroom. Men and women have their respective space. The bathroom even has a solar light if you need to “go” in the night.  I did, but since I used my headlamp to get there, I just kept it on.  
I was short on food because my plan was for one overnight only.  I had saved half of my tuna at lunch for dinner tonight. After I settled into my bunk room and changed into night clothes I took my food and trash back to the main building.  My plan was to eat tuna there and lock the rest up in mouse proof bins in the kitchen. I had one tortilla and peanut butter left for breakfast and a mini milky way candy bar to get me to Pinkham Notch tomorrow. 
This is where the magic happens!  There was a group of 7 cooking dinner. They had packed up (maybe via the gondola) fresh meat and veggies. I was invited to eat dinner with them.  What a treat!  Everything was homemade from scratch.
On the menu: 
Lentil Soup with sun-dried tomatoes, olive oil, and curry 
Homemade German meatballs
Fresh guacamole 
Veggie slaw made of cabbage, broccoli, and cilantro with fresh lemon and olive oil dressing. 
Wow!  We don’t get that on the trail!  
I went to bed fat and happy!  And because there were 5 bunks in my room with no humans, I took extra pillows and propped up my knee all night long.

",Carter Notch Hut,"Oct 08, Mon",7.10
Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604307,"I was the first one in the main building this morning at 6:45am sharp.  Kate was emptying her mouse traps. I held the doors open for her so she could dispose of two rodent cadavers.  
Hot coffee was in the percolator. I remember my mom making coffee in a percolator when I was a kid. Happy times! I ate my tortilla with peanut butter. Kate had made pumpkin bread.  I had a piece of that too.  
With a much improved knee, I said my goodbyes and backtracked 0.3 miles by the pond I had passed last evening to get to the A.T.  
Today feels like a heatwave!  My journey started UP Wildcat Mountain 4442ft elevation. I was sweating very early, and wishing I had a short sleeved shirt again. 
It was a good while, but I reached the summit.  I took a minute up there to eat the other half of my tuna. (leftover from yesterday)The amount of calories I burn while climbing is astronomical. I’m ashamed to admit the amount of calories I actually take in when I’m hiking.  I literally nibble on candy all day. 
From there I had 1.6 miles of ridge hiking to Wildcat D peak. This terrain was dangerous.  The whites are rugged anyway, but this wetness makes it dangerous. When I planned my hike I didn’t really worry about losing my life because of terrain.  I worried about bears or venomous snakes.  It turns out terrain is far more likely to be what gets me.  Especially WET terrain in the Whites.  
So the time has come to start down the Wildcats southbound into Pinkham Notch.  Every single day hiker, section hiker, and NOBO I met along the way warned me of the steepness...so did Kate.  
I folded up my poles and put them away. Then I began climbing down. Sitting on my butt often then jumping to the boulder below.  It’s a time consuming tedious process.  I was determined to have NO falls!  Until I did. I was holding on to a boulder above me when my feet just couldn’t find any security below me.  I slid onto a large rock section with my right hip. HARD! Somehow I held on to the boulder above me so I didn’t slide all the way down to the ledge below me.  I just hung there from the boulder above me for a minute.  Once I decided nothing was broken I continued a controlled butt scoot down to the ledge below.  
The ledges got steeper and steeper. I was holding onto pine branches for security when I wasn’t simply choosing to just scoot on my butt. Pine sap had my hands a sticky gooey mess. At one point I had to drop pack and throw it down ahead of me. This went on for hours before I finally reached decent terrain with a mile left to go. 
I fell to tears when I realized the time. Papa Big Swig needed me to be at Pinkham Notch by 2:30pm.  He had a business call he couldn’t miss. I knew he would have to leave and come back later. At 2:33pm I had 0.7 miles left to go. There were some great views along the way, but this day has been rough.  
I made it to the road at 2:50pm and walked across to the visitor center. I couldn’t believe my eyes. There was our SUV!  It was locked so I left my pack right in front of it and hurried inside.  Papa Big Swig had been able to connect to their WIFI and take his call right there.  GOD is good!  I’m not sure how I would have handled waiting until 5pm. 
I have one more 27 mile section to fill in, and I’m done with the Whites. They say the terrain gets tremendously better after Moosilauke... I pray it’s so.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604315,"I had planned to fill in my last gap in the Whites today, but I ended up with unexpected business from home.  Between making phone calls, and a quick resupply run to the store it just became too late to set out in that kind of terrain for the 13 miles I have to do on day one.  
So today became a Nero for me and Seylor Jo.  I started where I had left off just south of Moosilauke and continued southbound.  
So all the rumors about the trail getting better south of Moosilauke are TRUE!!! Yay!  
It was like old times!  The sun was shining, colored leaves covered the trail, and Seylor was in heaven!  Sure there were some rocks and roots...even mud. But mostly there was a path. A real path!  
As Seylor and I started our hike going UP we could hear 3 or 4 dogs barking from the gap below us. One would even cry at times.  I have no idea what was going on, but Seylor was concerned.  She would put her her ears down a little and turn around like she needed to go there.  But she would just come back to me then turn around again and keep moving up until we no longer heard the raucous going on below.   
Our only UP today was this one. Mount Mist at 2220ft elevation.  I giggled a little and thought to myself “you call THIS a mountain”?  After being at 4K to 5k feet for so long it felt pretty easy.   
I purposefully hiked very slow.  Seylor was having a blast making her own blue blazes!  It was fun just letting her be a dog. I watched her chase a chipmunk up a tree. That chipmunk turned around an gave Seylor an earful from up there!  
I thought we had an extra hour to play around in the woods so I took a 45 minutes break. Seylor was exhausted already from ridding the world of varmints.(she never catches a thing)We shared some chicken and just relaxed listening to the sounds of the forest.  
With just a mile to go we headed towards the road. It wasn’t long before I saw Papa Big Swig and our other dog Gypsy Rose hiking towards us. Uh oh, I didn’t have that extra hour after all.  
On a cushy pine straw carpet, we all hiked out together.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604430,"Let me tell you all a little more about Cooper.  He’s one of the brightest most confident 8 year olds I’ve ever met.  I was asked a question about my Tyvek when I was at the shelter with him. I said it came from Walmart...Cooper said it’s got Lowes written on it. He was right! He read my journal recently and saw I only gave him credit for summiting four 4,000ft mountains, actually he has summited 18 4k’s!  Wow
that’s a big difference!  Awesome job Cooper!  
Today I chose to NOBO my last little 27 mile gap in the Whites. It was to be 55 degrees and a good day to hike and summit several more 4K mountains.  
I came in on a blue blaze which means I hiked 0.6 miles that I won’t get credit for.  I’m full packing and planning for an overnight at Galehead Hut 12.9 miles.  
My hike started going UP. This will be 6 miles of UP!  It was a little chilly and damp, but the weather forecast lead me to believe the sun will come out.  
At first the trail was great.  Not many rocks or roots.  I was hiking beside a flowing brook.  You know I love that!  Colored leaves covered my path making it hard to differentiate if I was going to step on rock, root, or mud. I said aloud “this trail is like a box of chocolates”. 
Before long I crossed that brook on boulders. The trail went up and away from there to Franconia Ridge.  I stopped half way up for lunch.  I packed in a leftover grilled all beef hotdog. Mmmm delicious!  
After about 20 minutes break I continued up to Little Haystack Mountain.  4780ft elevation.  That’s where everything started going haywire!  I was in the wet clouds. It was cold and windy. Where was my beautiful day?  
I continued on eventually going up Mount Lincoln at 5089ft elevation. That’s when I realized this weather is going to be something to deal with.  Above tree line makes a big difference regarding weather. There were no views. Just a grey abyss.  Winds were steady but sometimes gusts came so strong I was actually blown over.    
I fought my way across the ridge to Mount Lafayette. I really don’t know how I made it there. At the summit was a sign to Greenleaf Hut 1.1 miles off trail. I looked the direction of the arrow, but I could see nothing.  No cairn, no resemblance of a trail.  If I stayed on the A.T.  I had 3.3 miles to a tent sight.   I decided to go for it.  
I was not dressed for this cold weather. Soon rime ice was forming on the rocks. Ice was even forming on my trekking poles.   It was impossible to move when the gusts hit.  I finally hid behind a boulder. For the first time I thought I might die out here.  I was shivering and not able to keep moving.  That’s a death sentence. 
I called Papa Big Swig. I had real fear, and I needed a miracle.  During my conversation with Papa Big Swig one lone hiker came up the path.  It was my miracle, Griggs.  
Griggs suggested I put on my puffy coat even though it would get wet.  I did.  I also grabbed out my rain pants just to get a second layer on my lower half.  As I was zipping up my pack the wind got my rain pants.  They flew down the side of the mountain.  Gone for good.  
Griggs encouraged me to turn back around, endure the wind and go down to Greenleaf Hut.  I explained that I couldn’t find the path. He said he would take me...and he did.  Greenleaf was not really his plans for today, but he changed for me.  
Once we got below tree line it was like a whole different world. Below the clouds Griggs and I were able to enjoy a little view.  
My knees give me a lot of discomfort going down, so I’m slothier than usual. I told Griggs I would be alright now and he can move ahead.  He refused.  Said he’s in no hurry, and he walked me to the door.  A young man with character. 
There was bunk room for both of us, so I paid for his stay. It was the least I could do. He literally saved my life.  
Greenleaf Hut is a full service hut.  We had a hot dinner, and will get a hot breakfast in the morning.  I met some lovely folks who were doing weekend hikes with a hut stay.  But the weather prevented the hiking part today.  
I learned some of those gusts were 80MPH!  The forecast calls for wind and snow on the ridge tomorrow. Ugh!  
For now I’m fat and happy.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604509,"I woke to find snow on the ground, with more snow falling. Even though I’m not overly thrilled about hiking in snow, it was really pretty to see on the evergreens.   
Breakfast this morning was grand!  Oatmeal, coffee cake, eggs, bacon, and pineapple.  Hot coffee too! 
With a full belly I set out to see how far I could get today.  The “alleged” 1.1 miles blue blaze trek back up Lafayette went by quickly.  I say alleged because it’s the longest 1.1 miles I’ve ever hiked! And of course those miles don’t count for today’s hike. 
It was snowy and Icy when I got to the ridge, but I was better prepared this morning. I bought new rain pants at the hut, and was layered up much better than yesterday. The winds are only half of what they were yesterday as well.  I breathed a sigh of relief and put on a smile.  
I was able to take it slow across the ridge. It was necessary because of ice. Some of the slabs had a very thin layer of ice that was invisible.  I fell twice. The first time I landed on my backpack. It absorbed every ounce of that fall!  Nothing hurt!  The second one I slid all the way down to the bottom of the slab on my side. No injury again!  
Once off the ridge and below tree line it went really well. The snow was still spitting and melting making things wet.  
I one more good sized climb up Mount Garfield at 4500ft elevation. There was no view at the summit.  Just a grey abyss.  
I continued down the other side.  Once I got below the clouds I did get one pretty view.  No complaints about the lack of views though. At least I can deal with the weather today. 
I hiked into Galehead Hut. As a thruhiker I do not need reservations, but this time, the Hut is full.   They do not turn thruhikers away, but when there isn’t a bunk available we do something called Work For Stay.  
Essentially we’re allowed to eat after paying guests are done. Then we do a chore and we can sleep on the dining room floor.  My chore will be end of evening dishes at 9:30pm!  I go to bed at 8pm.  Ugh!  The same scenario will occur in the morning for breakfast.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604510,"I want to start out by wishing my friend Rose a happy 54th!  She’s been my friend longer than any other!  
In the end last night there was a guest no show. I was able to sleep on a top bunk. This is the 4th bunk up. Imagine that ladder climb on a 2am potty run! 
Staff at the Huts wake you up at 6:30 every morning by singing and playing an instrument. This morning was a flute and You Are My Sunshine. That’s the song I sing to my granddaughter Charley Faye!  It was nice. 
So, since I’m a thruhiker and I work for stay I do not get to eat until all paying guests are done.  I took this time to get dressed and get my pack ready for the day.  Then I ate cold eggs, oatmeal, pancakes, and cranberry juice.  Cold or not, it was delicious!  My chore after eating was to sweep the dining room and bunk rooms. Zip zoom, I was on my way. 
Today’s forecast called for 2 more inches of snow, wind gusts up to 86MPH, and below freezing temps.  I was dressed appropriately.  It was cold and snowy at the start, but the wind gusts weren’t horrible. I’m guessing the temp was around 20 degrees.  
My trek started up South Twin Mountain at 4902ft elevation. As I was climbing up an icy rock slab, my Twinkie(snack for later) worked its way out of the pocket on my rain jacket. I made a failed attempt to recover it with my trekking poles. The poles just kept scooting my Twinkie further and further down a ribbon of ice on the slanted slab of rock. For a brief moment I contemplated dropping pack and getting it but I decided I would burn more calories doing that than it was worth. I continued up.  
There was no view at the summit, just another cloud covered white abyss.  I started down. The grade was actually quite nice!  The terrain wasn’t too bad either!  AND...the sun started to peek through!  It was becoming a beautiful day!  
I crossed paths with another thruhiker. His name is Drizzy.  He flipped up from Connecticut and is on his way back.  He’s discouraged in the Whites and mentioned quitting.  I hope he sticks with it!  He’s sooo close! (Even though I agree the Whites are trying)
I started up Mount Guyot 4580ft elevation. There, I got a view. A beautiful view!  I was standing on snowy rocks and took a picture of snow capped mountains across from me, but below I can see there is no snow at all. As a matter of fact it looks like a warm sunny day. That’s the difference 4000ft makes regarding weather. 
On the way down Guyot I stopped for a Cliff Bar.  It was peanut butter banana flavored. That flavor is new to me, and now my favorite!  
As I continued down I took another fall. The ice is so thin and transparent. I stepped on a log and BOOM! My left hip now has a bruise to match the right one from my fall on the Wildcats a few days ago. 
Next I started up Zealand Mountain. By now there was no wind. It was probably30 degrees, and sunny!  I took off my rain gear, and my ski mask. This day is lovely!  
Since it was so nice I decided to take a little blue blaze loop to a view. So glad I did!  I dropped pack and enjoyed the view for 20 minutes while the sun warmed my soul.  Pure bliss. 
I started down Zealand mountain which is known for its waterfalls. I began to hear them, then see them, and eventually even cross a few. They were beautiful and they lead me straight to Zealand Falls Hut. 
Papa Big Swig made a paying reservation for me tonight. Always my knight in shining armor. I will get hot food and a bunk without doing a thing. I’m so excited!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604526,"There were only 10 guests at the Hut last night. Four Canadian couples on holiday, a section hiker, and myself.  We all sat at the same table for our family style breakfast. All meals at the Huts are served family style.  The Canadian group was loads of fun!  We laughed a lot last night and even more this morning.  
I lost cell service yesterday and have not been able to finalize my extraction plans with Papa Big Swig. Today is my extraction day. He knows where to pick me up, just not when.  Praying I get service on the trail.  
The weather was perfect this morning. Around 30 degrees and no wind. From the moment I stepped out to hike I could hear the falls rushing beside me. LOVELY!! 
I cannot believe the amazing change in terrain. I had a real trail, and I was hiking on a ridge!  I can still picture coming to an area where all the leaves around me were golden. It reminded me of the days when Mountain Laurel made me feel like someone turned on the lights. It was beautiful and rejuvenating.  
I came to a very rocky area that was exposed on the side of a mountain. That area gifted me the most beautiful view of the day!  By now the sun was shining so brightly. I was warm, and in awe of all this splendor.  This IS God’s country... dad was right.  
There was a short rocky area I had to pick my way through before I found myself back on a good path. A young French couple coming towards me stopped to talk. They were stuck without fire last night. Their waterproof matches did not work. I’ve never tried waterproof matches, and I probably won’t ever now. I gave them my extra lighter.  It had been a gift from Big Kahuna.  
By mid-morning it turned into a beautiful hiking day in every way.  I took a minute to take off my outer layer(rain gear).  I hiked on a couple more hours like that.  It was great!  
Around noon I was coming close to a shelter where I had planned to stop for a snack. It was too far off trail for my liking, so I pulled up a nice boulder and took a seat.  It felt good to drop pack and rest a while. One eaten Cliff Bar later I was on my way again. 
This terrain was so nice that I could hike at my old pace of 2-2.5 miles an hour. It felt so good!  I just breathed in deeply and smiled as I hiked over the carpeted trail. Sometimes vibrant red leaves, and sometimes gold leaves. Once in a while a mixture of red and gold. I wish I could find a word to describe the smell of fall leaves. I love it so much. 
With about 2 miles to go it began to mist. I knew this was coming as we get a weather report every morning at the Huts. I dropped pack and put my rain gear back on. It really didn’t deter me any.  I just enjoyed my hike in the rain. 
Before I knew it, my time in the Whites was over...sooo bittersweet. Yes the climbs were hard. At times treacherous. But the reward is immeasurable.  I took lots of pictures, but they aren’t a complete product of being there.  So many times I sat thousands of feet high amongst the vastness and realized how small I am, how grand the planet is, and that God truly IS.  I am so blessed.  So fortunate, and so grateful. I wish a picture could bring out those feelings for everyone, but it does not. 
I reached my pick-up location very early compared to the hiking times I’ve previously been able to do in the Whites.  No cell service still. I contemplated pitching my tent to get out of the rain, but decided I didn’t want to pack up a went tent.  I took out my sit-upon and waited. It was 12:48pm. 
As the rain continued to fall so did the temperature.  By 1:30pm I began to shiver.  I pulled out my emergency blanket and put it to use.  A day hiker happened along. His car was parked there.  I asked if he would text Papa Big Swig for me when he got cell service.  He said he would, and he did.  It’s a good thing because Papa Big Swig had estimated my arrival around 5pm. That estimate would usually be true in the Whites, but not today. 
He was there to get me by 2:30pm with all new dry clothing and a towel.  I’m a lucky gal!

I’m so excited to get back on the trail! So much so that I was up before the sun!  Both Papa Big Swig and I are ready to get this last 14 hours of driving/riding behind us. 
I was able to order micro-spikes from REI yesterday. I had them shipped to our hotel in Vermont. I may have to hike a day or two without them before they arrive though. I’ll just continue to be careful...as usual. 
I’ve changed my hiking plans for tomorrow.  I’m going to do a NERO, then 14 miles the next day.  This way I can slack pack. Sadly my knees are still pretty rough, as well as my low back and left hip. I’m just going to nurse myself along for this final stretch. 
Something else new is that we will not have the camper. Most campsites are closed for the season now. Papa Big Swig will be staying in hotels, and sometimes tenting with me.  I told him I would be ok on my own, but he’s not having that. I got a good one! 
Today’s photo is of me by a cairn watching clouds roll away and the sun come out. I was coming down from Katahdin where it had been a grey abyss. At this moment I was following Cairn piles to Abol Slide Trail.  It was a difficult, tedious descent, but our best views were from there that day. 
Boots on tomorrow!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605035,"I woke up this morning in our hotel room at the Comfort Inn in White River Junction Vermont. 
I had the hotel breakfast and began getting things together for my slack pack NERO today.  I am SO disorganized!  I left a lot of things in the camper which is now parked at my sister-in-law’s in Georgia!  Ugh!   So off I went with no pocket knife, no ear warmer, no rain poncho, and only one contact lens. 
It wa a 40 minutes drive to my starting point. I was pleasantly surprised to still see colorful leaves on the trees.  It made for a beautiful drive and reminded me of a Thomas Kinkade painting.  
During the drive I saw a “moose crossing” sign, and my mind immediately went to my tramily. I really do miss them.  We text regularly, but it sure isn’t the same. 
Papa Big Swig pulled up to my start location. Seylor and I soon found ourselves going UP. I couldn’t believe it, but I was short of breath!  It wasn’t even a true mountain!  I think it was about an 1200 foot elevation gain. No more two weeks off trail!  
Last night’s weather forecast called for rain all day, but this morning it had been pushed back until noon. That meant I was able to enjoy myself without being wet for a while. 
The forest has a new look now. Not just parts of it, but the entire forest floor is carpeted with leaves! It’s so pretty to see. The higher I went, the more bare the trees became, and the thicker the carpet. At one point Seylor and I stopped in our tracks as a wind made it snow leaves all around us.  I wasn’t quick enough to catch it all, but today’s photo is the tail end of that moment.  
It wasn’t raining this morning, but last night’s rain had left things good and wet.  There were creeks where I’m pretty sure they normally are not. I was crossing on a log and slipped right off. I didn’t fall, but my boots were soaked. Once again I felt cool water rushing over the top of my boots and down to surround my feet. I said to myself out loud “welcome back”!  Then I giggled a little. 
Seylor on the other hand just traipsed right through every creek, puddle, or muddy bog she could get her paws into. After two days in a vehicle, she was tail wagging happy out there just being a dog. 
The rains came when o had about 45 minutes of hiking left. I pulled out my fancy Packa rain gear and sloshed on. Sometimes it sprinkled and sometimes it poured, but I just loved whatever I got. 
It was down to a sprinkle when I popped out onto the road where Papa Big Swig was waiting. He was prepared with towels for both Seylor and I.  I’m calling this little NERO a great start getting back on trail!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605092,"I arrived at my starting point about 7:20 this morning.  Seylor was raring to go!  Papa Big Swig walked in a little ways with our other dog Gypsy Rose. After Gypsy did her business Papa Big Swig turned back as Seylor and I continued southbound. 
There was a little creek crossing early on. I hiked beside that creek a long while. There were several small waterfalls. I find the sound of rushing water to be so soothing and energizing at the same time.
Every new season on the trail brings new beauty, and new challenges. I love the fallen leaves, but they sure make it hard to see the trail! I double checked my location several times today. 
Shortly after the creek crossing seylor and I started UP. It was a slow steady incline 3.5 miles up Mount Cube at 2909ft elevation.  
On the way up I crossed that same creek several times.  It kept getting louder, wider, deeper. Then it happened, I could not get across it using boulders. There were boulders, but most of them had water flowing right over the top. I finally took off my boots and socks. Then I rolled up my pants and long johns and waded right across.  It was ICE COLD! Seylor trotted right through. 
I used a bandana to dry my feet and put my socks and boots back on. I continued hiking UP.  About a mile from the summit Mr Sun decided to shine.  I was good and warm by the time I reached the top.  
There were a couple of section hikers up there complaining about the cold. It was icy and there was some wind, but I enjoyed it. The view was amazing!  
I was 1.4 miles from a shelter. I had planned to hike there for my lunch break, but realized it was 0.2 miles off trail.  So when I found myself on a ledge with another awesome view, I made new lunch plans.  The sun was still out and it was nice.  While I was eating I watched a hawk fly over and land on a nearby tree. 
With full belly’s, Seylor and I continued down Mount Cube. I heard some gunshots while going down. I had also heard some gunshots while going up. It’s deer season.  I’m sure I’ll be hearing  them for a while.  
The terrain was a mixture today. 50% nice path, and the other 50% was either mud, rocks and roots, or boulders. I spent a fair amount of time bouldering down my descent. 
I had a short distance before I started up Smarts Mountain. During that time I had another raging creek crossing. By now my boots were soaked from the wet muddy trail. I just walked right through. 
The UP to Smarts Mountain was a 3.9 miles ascent to 3237ft elevation. Once I hit 2000 feet the ground became icy and crunchy. Seylor had a Scooby Doo moment on an icy boulder. Paws were flying everywhere!  
The views continued on the way up.  This entire day was about the views really. There was some bouldering on the way down, and quite a few slabs. It was tricky at times. I slid more than once, but luckily stayed on my feet.  
Just as the terrain began to improve there was Papa Big Swig. He brought Gypsy Rose to get a little exercise. Gypsy just turned 15 years old, but today she played with the energy of a pup. It was so cute to watch. 
When we walked into our hotel room Seylor went straight to her kennel and put herself to bed.  I guess this day wore her out.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605139,"It was 29° when I started hiking this morning at 6:45am. There was no wind, and no rain. I had my puffy on, so I was comfortable as I started going UP. 
I was early enough to catch the morning birds.  Those tweets and chirps put a big smile on my face.  
That’s what I was doing, smiling, when I took a wrong turn. I was only about 15 minutes in when I found myself retracing my steps for the first time today. 
Back on trail I was keeping a close watch for blazes. All of these leaves make it so easy to get off trail. That’s when I came across a random rock wall. I often wonder why these walls exist. Before my day was over I saw 3 of them. I remember thinking they would be great for snowball fights! 
I was only two miles in when I popped out onto a road. As I was approaching the road I could see my first big climb waiting patiently for me on the other side.  
I was doing some deep thinking While making my way towards that UP. I was thinking to myself how nice it is to have only MY thoughts floating around in my mind. At that moment I was reflecting on  our country’s current political situation. With elections going on there’s lots of thinking to be done, and it’s so nice to NOT be inundated with others words of persuasion. All I heard was the breeze in the trees.  I’m free to think and feel however I want. 
About half way up I began to sweat. I stopped and dropped pack to take off my puffy. It barely fit in my slack pack with all of my rain gear.  I was pretty sure my chicken salad sandwich was smashed.  
I went right back into deep thinking mode. These thoughts brought me all the way up to my first view of the day.  It was windy up there!  I pulled my puffy coat back out and put it on.  This began a pattern of puffy on, puffy off...all day long.  
Leaving the view the trail was nice wide and obvious! I was so happy to have a path I didn’t need to second guess.  It brought me to a ski slope with a ski lift. The lift is not in operation yet, but there was a privy so I took advantage of that. 
When I came out of the privy I began to systematically look for a blaze. There were none to be found.  Time for Guthook’s. I had completely gone the wrong direction from the view. Ugh!  Off trail again!  
When I got back, I found the trail. It was entirely covered with leaves.  I am seriously having a difficult time discerning the trail from the forest. 
Once on trail, I had a quick down. In no time I was going back up to Moose Mountain. This mountain has twin peaks.  I made it up the north peak quickly.  There was a shelter about a mile past the peak, so that was my planned lunch break.  
This area has really bad signage.  I was close to the shelter, but never saw it. I took a break on ledges yesterday, but I never saw how to get to that shelter either.  I pulled up a log today and just enjoyed my lunch right there on trail. 
Soon I was on my way to south peak. I found myself doing my best to stay out of the mud. New Hampshire has a lot of boggy areas.  The excessive rain this year has made it worse. Often times the trail itself has becomes a flowing creek.  
I don’t know if it was the water, bog, or leaves, but I found myself lost...AGAIN! Really? Three times! One more time I retraced my steps.  I think I spent an entire hour today just re-finding the trail.  There’s only 9 hours of daylight now, so I cannot waste 1 of them lost.  Not sure what I’m going to do, but that’s got to change. 
Eventually I did make it up South Peak of Moose Mountain. The view was phenomenal!  I’m so grateful to have been given another day full of views!  
From there it was pretty much all down hill to my extraction point. On the way I crossed paths with 3 day hikers. I was thinking to myself I wasn’t going to see anybody today, then there they were. They said local hiking is down because it’s hunting season.  About 5 minutes after we parted ways I heard a gunshot. That was the first gunshot for me today.  There was one more to follow.  
On my way down I saw a fat grey squirrel collecting his winter bounty.  I hiked out through a series of fields. Then down to where Papa Big Swig was patiently waiting.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605144,"I planned a NERO today due to expected rain this afternoon.  It’s a good thing I did, because my aching body didn’t want to move this morning.  My muscles are aching just like they did back in Georgia!  Glutes on fire!!!...and calves, and hamstrings, and traps, and shoulders! 
So I made it to the trail at 8:00am fir a quick 7 miles. 
The trail was already wet from last night’s rain. It was misty this when I hit the trail, so I knew I needed to knock this out quickly.  
The wet leaves made my path a little easier to follow. I was thankful for this as I could already hear gunshots in the not so far away distance.  I really do not want to venture too far off trail today. 
Only about a mile in the mist turned to a steady drizzle. At the same time I began to see boulders all around me. Not on trail yet, but it wouldn’t be long.  
I hiked and bouldered my way up Velvet Rocks Mountain. There was no view from the top, so I just started right back down.  
The climb up wasn’t steep at all.  So I was surprised to find my descent steep and difficult. There were lots of boulders and wet slabs on a steep grade. I was so happy to find a knotted rope to use going down a large slab. Many thanks to whoever did that!  I’m 4 wet days now without a fall!  
From there the terrain was a steady flow of good sized UPs and DOWNs.  The leaves remain a challenge. At one point I stood there saying to myself ‘which way do I go”.  I went on intuition and got it right!  
I was moving along quickly. Sometimes the trail is a plain old path now. A few roots and rocks, but a real path. I had forgotten what that felt like after being in the Whites with boulder after boulder.  For the record, I remember now that it feels GREAT! 
So I was feeling great when I realized I had not seen a white blaze in a while...and things were really getting swampy. I looked up and around to find a blue blaze on a tree not far away. NOT AGAIN!  
Yes I was about an eighth of a mile off course.  I hiked back up what I had just hiked down, and carried on. 
Thirty minutes later I found myself even further off trail than the first time!  It was going to take a good 20 minutes for me to retrace my steps. The forest is getting pretty bare now, so instead of staying on path I just cut straight across to get back on trail. It took about 5 minutes. 
I continued going down until I popped out of the woods at the Dartmouth Sports Complex.  I was in Hanover NH!  
The trail goes right through town. I wish I had not been so wet and muddy because there were a lot of little artsy shops I would have loved to visit. 
The road I walked down was extremely busy. I soon learned why as I passed a school set up for voting today. How nice to see everyone exercising their right!  
I passed a delicious smelling Indian Restaurant, and a lovely Parish. It was Saint Denis Parish.  The building made of stone had so much character. I’m thinking it must be over 100 years old. Hanover is another one of those cities with a soul. I could feel it.
I made a turn and soon was walking on a bridge over the Connecticut River. I could see my breath for the first time today. 
Within minutes there was the sign. I am in Vermont!  Wow!  So long New Hampshire!  I know I’ll be back. 
I continued on a sidewalk right through the town of Norwich Vermont. It’s another cute northeastern community.  
I walked past a grade school during recess. The kids were playing outside in this drizzly weather. I lingered there for a good while and just enjoyed their energy.  A group of boys were playing football with all their might.  I don’t remember the last time I watched such a large group of kids playing outside like that. Youth makes me happy!  
Not far past the school the trail turned and headed out of town. I will begin tomorrow’s journey In the woods right there.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605151,"Before I talk about this fabulous day, I want to say thank you to one of my readers. The lady at the front desk of our hotel said one of my readers had stopped by a day or two ago with a gift for me. Understandably the policy here is to not give out guest information.  I’m sorry that happened, but thank you for thinking of me! We are here until Friday morning if you would like to stop back by. Please don’t feel obligated, I just want you to know that I am grateful for your efforts. 
It was a little past 7:30 this morning when I jumped on trail. 
I crossed a creek right away and crossed it again 10 minutes later.  The flow of the creek was slow and silent. 
I continued on listening to the rustle of fallen leaves below my feet.  I came to a road just as the sun started to come out from behind some clouds. This was becoming a beautiful day!  
After I crossed the road and stepped back into the woods. The sun continued to shine through the now bare trees. It warmed my bones, and made for pleasant hiking. 
The other nice thing about bare trees is that I could easily see mountain peaks in the distance.  I had amazing views nearly all day long!  
I was looking at one of those views when I nearly stepped in a fresh pile of bear poop! I haven’t seen a bear since Pennsylvania.  A few more feet down trail there were bear tracks too! My hopes were up, but no bear appeared. 
Soon I was hiking beside a farm. I could hear a couple of dogs barking.  I thought that would be enough to scare away a bear. So I just started watching busy birds preparing for winter as I hiked on. 
That’s when I heard the first gunshots of the day. 
I was in need of a privy, and Guthook’s said a Shelter was near.  Much to my surprise there was a proper sign!  I walked the 0.2 miles off trail to find a clean privy and nice shelter.  I’m impressed with Vermont’s amenities. 
 
As I was leaving the shelter I heard gunshots again. 
The day really had become a perfect hiking day.  There was enough breeze to keep me from sweating, and enough sun to keep me from chilling. The trail had become a nice wide path. Almost like a service road. I remember thinking I could hike forever on a day like this day with a trail like this trail. 
That’s when I realized I hadn’t seen a white blaze in a while. AND this really is a service road.  You guessed it...back I went!  Those service roads get me every time! 
Once back on trail I realized I was getting close to a town.  There was a creek crossing just before I started going down into town. Sure enough I slipped off the boulder and landed ankle deep in water. I had managed to keep my feet dry for 3 hours today. 
More gunshots. 
I continued into the village of West Hartford. It’s a quaint little northeastern community.  I hiked past historical a building known as the West Hartford Meeting House. I’m sure it was constructed in the 1800’s, and has been very well maintained. 
I was just walking right on through town, when a pick-up truck stopped and asked if I was lost. I didn’t think I was lost. I said “no”.  WRONG! Thank goodness he stopped. I had walked right past my turn. 
Never fear, trail angel Bob is here!  He gave me a ride back to my missed turn and all the way to the woods.  I learned that Bob was born and raised right there in Vermont. He’s a retired farmer. Farmers can’t rest, so now he makes maple syrup. I find that super interesting! Our conversation was good, so I talked with him another 5 minutes or so before I got out of the truck. As I was leaving he grabbed a wooden box off the dashboard and said I have a gift for you. He pulled out a 1979 half dollar coin and put it in my hand. He gave me a little sideways hug and kissed my cheek. Then he said “God Bless”.  I thanked him for my gift before stepping out. I’ll always remember trail angel Bob, he reminded me so much of my dad. In so many ways! 
From there the rest of the day was a steady roller coaster of up and down. The terrain was great and I made good time. 
I sat on the steps of a privy for lunch. They were new wooden steps, and they were dry. I was planning to sit in the shelter, but for the life of me I couldn’t find the shelter that privy belonged to. My Guthook’s app said I was right there. I searched all over and saw nothing!  It’s not like I couldn’t see clearly since all the trees are bare. I left that place scratching my head. 
A couple miles or so later I saw a sign for Cloudland Shelter. It said 0.4 miles with an arrow pointing the direction.  I thought to myself SSSSUUUURRRE there’s a shelter down there. I stayed on trail but wondered what would I have done if I were planning an overnight? I mean I know I would just pitch my tent, but what if someone was doing a weekend and planned to shelter only?  
Anyway, I hiked on comfortably with the UPs and DOWNs. I came to another one of those man made rock walls.  This one went on for a good mile. I can’t imagine why these walls are here.  Ive thought maybe they were built during war times for soldiers to hide behind while reloading their muskets. I have such an imagination!  
Just past the rock wall I began to hear a moose bellowing. He bellowed 3 or 4 times. I had to make sure it was really a moose I heard, so I double checked on YouTube.  It REALLY was!  During my last moose encounter all I got was a couple of grunts. 
There was one more creek crossing. I just went right in.  I’ve given up on the idea of dry feet. I hiked through a few fields, and saw a mare and colt grazing.  Right then my thoughts landed on my Aunt Joanne.  She’s always there for me.  I am blessed and oh so grateful! 
With 2 miles left to go my body started letting me know it was ready to be done for the day. I pushed through my last big UP and enjoyed the view for a minute. It was almost sunset so I hurried down the other side to beat the dark. 
I heard rapid gunfire on the way down. That’s NOT deer hunting. 
It was dusk when I reached the bottom of the hill. There was Papa Big Swig waiting patiently as always.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605171,"I had planned another 20 miler for today, but changed my mind during breakfast. Instead I chose to leapfrog and get a high elevation climb done during today’s good weather. The next two days are predicted to be cold and rainy. That means icy and snowy up high.  
Papa Big Swig dropped me off at my starting point a little late. It was after 8 am.  I had not planned on taking Seylor either but she hopped out ready to go, so that changed as well. She flipped her head and pranced like a baby doe when she realized she gets to hike! 
She and I started out with a little creek crossing.  The creek twisted around the trail in such a way that we crossed it again. Over the course of the next mile it grew to be bigger, and soon I had that lovely sound of rushing water that I enjoy so much.  
I was about to start a small descent when Seylor stopped in her tracks. There was a hiker coming up the hill with a full pack on. I asked if he was a thruhiker and he said yes.  It took us a minute to realize he’s thruhiking the Long Trail not the A.T.   There’s a brief section where the Long Trail and the A.T. are one and the same.  We exchanged information about what’s coming up for each other, then said our “Happy Trails” and continued on our way. 
I hiked to Governor Clement Shelter. It was right on trail so I took a minute there to drop pack. It was a nice shelter made of stone with a fireplace built right in. I took advantage of the privy which was also a nice one. As far privies go anyway. 
The trail went beside and behind the shelter where there was a “dog danger” sign. Apparently this area is over populated with porcupines. Sure enough Seylor sniffed one out!  Thankfully no harm came to either animal. 
Seylor and I started going UP. We went Up for a little more than 3 miles to Mount Killington elevation 4235ft. 
At around 3200ft there was frost on the ground. For a very brief moment it snowed. I wasn’t fast enough to even get a picture. 
Nearing lunchtime I found myself at Cooper Lodge. This shelter is the highest shelter in the state of Vermont.  It’s also the most dilapidated shelter I’ve seen on the entire A.T.  Nonetheless Seylor and I went inside for lunch.  There was a good picnic table in there, and at least we were out of the elements. 
While there I made the executive decision to extend my hiking plans from 12 miles to 15 miles today. This will make tomorrow’s hike only 19 miles instead of 23 miles. So I left out of there with a little pep in my step. 
I was moving along quickly when my foot caught a tree root and down went McGinney. It was a hard jolt on my already aching left hip and knee, but I shook it off and kept my quick pace.  I really wanted to be off trail before dark. 
The trail had a lot of rocks and roots. I did some bouldering but not much. There were several trees down in this area.  Many of them fell across the trail. I watched Seylor leap up like a gazelle over one with some pretty high branches. I was impressed! 
I had been making such good time that I was surprised to hear cars coming by on the road that was to have been my first pick-up location. I was just a few yards away.  I called Seylor to come back so I could get her leash before we hit the road. At the same time I took a hurried step on the board I was using to cross a bog. I went down so fast. AND so hard! My left knee took the brunt of it. I was in pain. I laid there for a couple of minutes with tears in my eyes. This was not good.  
After a few minutes I was able to get up and eventually walk. I have no idea why I felt the need to rush. She’s such a good listener and always listens the first time. As a matter of fact she came over and sat by me until I was able to get up. 
I pulled myself together for the last 3.3 miles of my hike. There was a bit of up then all down. Little ice pellets started to fall as I began my descent . I guess technically it was hailing. They were so tiny that they looked like dandruff on my black shirt. I had to laugh as I was having a Lieutenant Dan moment. “You call this hail”!?! 
The hail stopped before I reached the bottom. Seylor and I popped out at a campground which is now closed. I leashed her up and we walked to the road where Papa Big Swig was waiting. 
I’m planning to fill in my 20 mile Gap tomorrow if my body lets me. My left knee is quite swollen at the moment.  It’s actually double the size of my right. Saying a prayer.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605184,"I started hiking about 7:45 this morning to fill in my 20 mile gap. While I hiked Papa Big Swig packed up our hotel room and moved us to a new hotel in Rutland. I’m making progress!  
A cow pasture is where I started. There were no cows, but lots of evidence had been left behind. 
There was a wooden ladder going up and over the fence from the cow pasture to a field. I hiked through that field then through one more. I was steadily going UP. 
It was 29 degrees this morning. The frosty grass was crunchy under my boots. Then the sun came out. The ground began to thaw., and the warmth felt nice on my back as I climbed. 
Soon enough I entered the woods and continued my 4.5 miles climb. It was a whole lot of UP first thing in the morning. Fortunately the grade wasn’t bad, and the terrain was nice too. I made good time and held a steady 2mph pace. 
I heard gunshots two or three times while I was going up. I am wearing an orange hat now. Papa Big Swig got that for me and a bright orange harness for Seylor Jo. She had the day off today though.  
Technically I was hiking hills today. Mind you, these are GIANT hills! From my hills I could see the surrounding mountains easily. A couple of them already had some snow on top. 
I was feeling the burn when I finally reached the top. From the top there was a building 0.1 miles off trail called The Lookout. It’s a private owned building but they allow hikers in, and of course there’s a view. I was getting excited as I walked up to see a ladder that goes to a rooftop platform. 
I went straight to the ladder and started climbing up. That’s when I noticed someone through the window. He didn’t look up and wave but rather was scurrying around the floor picking things up. It was strange. My gut told me not to keep going up the ladder. I came down and walked around the cabin. I noticed the entrance was posted for no admittance. I’m not real sure how he even got in there. I think this guy is a squatter.  It just didn’t feel right to me, so I left. 
As I hiked the 0.1 miles back to the trail I heard more gunshots. 
When noon rolled around I was nowhere near a shelter.  I was hungry though so I pulled up a log and sat down to eat. It didn’t take long before I caught a chill.  I ate quickly and started moving again. It took a few minutes for me to get warmed back up.  
Yes it was chilly, but as long as I kept moving I felt good. As a matter of fact I was thinking it was such a great day maybe that rain won’t come after all.  
At 2:10pm it began to flurry.  I’m fine with that. I far prefer snow to rain.  I had been wearing my rain/snow pants all day in anticipation of this. When I had to stop to climb a ladder up a boulder, I took the time to dress my upper half.  I was good to go! 
Within an hour the entire forest was dusted with a brilliant white powder. Sooo beautiful!  It reminded me of the days of Mountain Laurel when it felt like someone just turned on the lights. 
I hiked on in complete awe of the beauty around me. With about 6 miles to go my get-up-n-go had got-up-n-went!  I pulled out a Twix Bar and refueled. Thanks Hat Lady for my bag of goodies!  I’ll enjoy every bite of every single one!  
That sugar did the trick.  Soon I found myself with some pep in my step again. I really was enjoying myself in this winter wonderland. 
With about 3 miles to go darkness came. My headlamp just wasn’t bright enough in the blinding snow. As beautiful as it was, I was having difficulty finding blazes and staying on trail.  
With 2 miles to go I popped out on a road just before an awesome looking boardwalk. I really wanted to keep going, but I called Papa Big Swig who was waiting only 10 minutes away. 
I didn’t know what was beyond the boardwalk and visibility was low.  Safety first.  So tomorrow I will be filling the last 2 miles of my gap.  My knee is still grapefruit sized a nero won’t hurt.

Woke up later than usual at our new hotel in Rutland VT. I slept like a baby! It was much needed.  
My knee remains the size of a grapefruit.  It’s painful at first but once I get going it’s ok.  I did use an ace wrap on it for hiking today though. 
Papa Big Swig and I found a local restaurant for breakfast.  It was hands down the best breakfast I’ve had EVER! If anybody is close to Rutland VT. eat breakfast at The Bakery Annex. Wow! 
After breakfast we got both dogs ready for a short day’s hike.  Seylor Jo and I will start at the south end and hike northbound to the boardwalk.  Papa Big Swig and Gypsy Rose will drive around and start at the boardwalk. It’s only 900ft of boardwalk, but Gypsy will love it. Papa Big Swig will too. 
It was noon before I jumped on trail. Seylor and I started in a park. We went over a nice wooden bridge with lots of mountain water rushing below. I could see beautiful mountain peaks in the distance. This day is going to be great! 
I started paying attention to the peaceful river right beside me. I decided to pull out my phone for a photo. 
That’s when I noticed two missed calls from Papa Big Swig and 3 text messages.  I had left it set on silent. Uh oh!  
I was only a mile in but had to turn around. Last night we saw 7 or 8 car accidents on our way back to the hotel. The snow hit hard and it seems folks have forgotten how to drive in it. We actually used our 4WD in places. Anyway, something happened to the bridge that leads to my pick-up location. I pray nobody was injured. There was a way around it, but that created a two hour drive. I was only hiking two miles or about an hour...mission aborted. It is what it is.  
This day is so gorgeous I couldn’t let it end with a 1 mile NERO. I decided to start back where I left off and put a few more miles in. 
I chose to northbound it. Papa Big Swig dropped Seylor and I off, then he took the SUV for winterizing and an oil change.
The trail started out muddy. The trail ended muddy. 
I’ve heard  stories about “Vermud” but I didn’t really experience it until today.  Nonetheless I love Vermont!  Friendly folks live here, the trail UPs and DOWN’s are nice, and I still have views!  
I wish I could end my story there, but nope.  I’m a bit embarrassed to tell the rest of this adventure, but it has to be told. Here goes nothing...
So I drank a LOT of coffee this morning. Then I had an iced coffee on my way to the trail. After two water crossings with water rushing into my boots, I could wait no longer. Nature was calling.  
This is truly the only time I wish I were a boy out here. Sometimes I laugh at myself looking for just the right tree to squat beside. It’s like I’m a dog. Seylor will sniff one, nope, sniff another, nope, sniff another and Ok, she’ll pee there.  
Anyway, today I had no time to sniff trees or I was going to pee my pants. I just set my poles down, pulled off my jacket and went about my business. I was on a slight slope. I normally wouldn’t do that either. I began to teeter a little so I grabbed a small tree behind me to steady myself. THE TREE BROKE!  Can you believe that?!?  
Down went the tree. Down I went. Bare butt in the dirt! There wasn’t a soul around to see it happen, but I felt so embarrassed!  Ugh!! 
I stood up, brushed myself off, and pulled my now wet pants back up. Thank GOD I only have 0.9 miles to go.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605231,"Thank you to all veterans of all branches! 
A special big THANK YOU to my personal hero, Papa Big Swig. 
He served in the United States Navy during the Beirut bombing in 1983. He was called ashore for recovery. As a 20 year old young man he did his job while active gunfire was still occurring all around him. I am proud of him and thankful his life was spared. So many have given all.   
Seylor Jo and I started heading south again today. We had passed hunters walking the road on our way to the start location, so of course I heard several gunshots this morning. It all stopped around 10am and no more. 
I kind of hit the ground running today. I love the easy UPs and DOWN’s of Vermont. Not sure how far I had gone when I came to a privy right on trail. It was part of Clarendon Shelter. Anyway, it was a brand new privy. Fully stocked with TP and everything. A hikers delight!  
By 8:45AM the sun was out big and round!  God saw fit to let me have it like that all day long!  Another hikers delight!  
This is just a delightful day! 
Seylor and I were making good time when a little bit of bouldering showed up. It wasn’t a lot, but a speed bump nonetheless.
While making our way over and around the speed bumps a skein of geese flew over head. Seylor stopped to check out all of the honking. I laughed as I thought I’ll be seeing them again in January at our condo in Florida! I’ll be flying south for the winter after my hike too! 
Once I made it past the boulders the trail became wet, muddy, or icy for several miles.  I still enjoyed myself with the warm sun shining down.  The temperature was in the 20’s, but that sun just warmed my soul. I have no complaints. 
It’s bizarre how as little as a 500ft change in elevation affects the entire climate on a mountain/hill. Several times I was in snow deeper than the top of my boots. Other times I was hiking over crunchy leaves or through mud and water all on the same mountain/hill. 
It was during one of the higher elevation moments when a snowmobile went whizzing by. There were several others out here enjoying this beautiful day today! We also crossed paths with a day hiker and his American Bulldog plus a Long Trail hiker with his huge Burnese dog!  He was a really beautiful dog! 
I had planned to stop at a shelter for lunch. Somehow I hiked right past it.  I was actually 2.5 miles past before I realized. It was noon, so I found a nice boulder with the sun shining right on it.  It was just right, and lunch was delicious!  
After lunch I crossed a main road to a nice foot bridge, then UP. The trail was extremely wet and muddy in this area. I don’t even know exactly how it happened, but down went McGinney!  It was such an awkward fall in the mud. No injury.  
I soon found myself hiking beside a large stream with beautiful cascading waterfalls. I enjoyed that tremendously! Then UP to White Rocks Junction where somebody had a good time making a ton of cairns.   From there on out the terrain remained pretty rocky. 
I hiked past a beautiful pond and hopped from rock to rock for another good mile or so. Then the trail became a nice wide path that took me to the Parking lot where Papa Big Swig waited.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605251,"With a short hike planned for today I slept in a bit.  That made for a late start, but it was nice because the sun was out in full view.  The temp was in the 20’s, but I felt warm. The air was still and it was a perfect day for hiking.  
Rocks Rocks Rocks. I think this is the “white Rocks” section.  It’s rightfully named!  
I hiked beside Big Branch River.  Rushing water was music to my ears as usual. Soon I crossed a nice wooden bridge and hiked right up to Big Branch Shelter.   It’s a small but nice shelter with a good picnic table out front.  I sat there a few minutes and enjoyed the river. 
From there I began a 3.5 miles ascent up to Baker Peak 2762ft elevation. On the trek up I realized I heard no gunshots this morning. This must be a protected area.   
The nice thing about being at a high elevation is that everything is frozen over.... until it’s not. And that my friends is how one ends up with a boot full of bog! 
At the summit I sat down and ate my lunch.  I could see icy slabs on the descent so I just put my micro-spikes on right then. I’m so glad I did! Those things are a game changer! 
I was thinking to myself that it’s nice the Long Trail is here too. In this area I had plenty of footprints in the snow making it easier to stay on trail. Until I realized I wasn’t. UGH!  I blindly followed those footprints right on down a blue blaze!  0.5 miles there, 0.5 miles back and no credit for it. 
Once I was back on trail I found myself on a very long boardwalk. It took me past a beautiful iced over lake. It was completely still, no water moved.  Eventually I crossed over 3 wooden bridges to Peru Peak Shelter. 
From there I started going UP. My journey UP took me through a snow covered pine forest. It was one of those LIGHTS ON moments. I had to take a photo. 
I reached the top of Styles Peak at 3380ft elevation to see the most spectacular view!   The climb up had been challenging trudging through the snow with heavy boots.  So glad I did it! 
It was only about a mile going back down the other side. I beat Papa Big Swig to my pick up location.  It was a short wait.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605279,"I have a planned NERO today. The NERO is mostly due to weather, but laundry needs done, and we’re moving our lodging a little further south.  I’m making ground! 
It was pointed out in my guestbook that I’m now past 1900 miles! I didn’t even realize. Thanks for keeping track Jay! 
It was 12:30pm when I finally got on trail. There were a few fat snowflakes still falling and wetness from the trees, but no real precipitation. 
Seylor joined me for my NERO. We started out going UP.  Snow had fallen overnight, then the rain turned it into a thick deep slush.  My calves felt every upward step I took. 
I was working so hard on that first 2.5 miles of UP my body began to overheat. Before I was a mile in I had to stop and shed some clothes.  Much improved!  
Before I knew it I had reached the top of Bromley Mountain at 3263ft elevation. It was a little surreal as I came to the summit.   I could barely make out a broken down concrete structure in the mist.  As I got closer I could read the lettering directing me to turn right. 
It was a bald up there and the snow was whipping around making visibility low. As I hiked past the concrete structure I slowly began to make out the remnants of a ski slope. I was on a ski slope!  I’m not a skier, but even I could tell the powder was perfect.  
I hiked past a building and what’s left of a ski lift. Then I went right on down the slope.  It was easy hiking, and lots of fun!  
I could clearly picture that mountain full of life with smiling young people skiing down that slope.  I was a little saddened that it is no more.  
The A.T. took a right turn back into the woods. It was a steady down for a couple of miles to the parking area where Papa Big Swig waited.

",VT route 11/30,"Nov 13, Tue",5.50
Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605295,"Last night I planned for a long 
hike today. For logistical reasons I chose to flip and go it Northbound.  
It was 18 degrees when I hopped out of the SUV in the Green Mountain National Forest.  
I began hiking in the snow.   The bogs were a little more frozen than yesterday. That was nice, but they were still slushy enough to make my boots heavy.  
I had fun this morning looking at all the different animal tracks in the snow.  I recognized deer tracks, and thought I possibly saw porcupine tracks, and maybe some kind of a cat. There must be some wild cats around here. 
I came to a nice wooden bridge and crossed a creek.  From there I started UP for my only big climb of the day.   
A fallen tree was across the trail.  I was debating if I should go over it or under it when I heard a raucous to my right. 
I looked up to see a beautiful moose!  He was huge! A gorgeous chocolate brown color. I just watched him trot away into the woods as I thanked God for blessing me with that special moment. 
I continued on my 4 miles journey UP to the peak of Stratton Mountain at 3940ft elevation.  
I hadn’t gone far before I started seeing moose tracks in the snow. Shortly after that I came across a big old pile of moose poop.  Looks like my moose was going SOBO until my presence ruined his plans. 
With about 2.5 miles left to go the incline significantly increased. This snow really makes a difference in the amount of physical effort it takes to climb.  
The summit was worth every ounce of effort I put in! Pretty awesome!  All of the pine trees were covered with ice. It was really a sight to see. There’s also an excessively tall fire tower up there. Just like the pine trees, it was covered with ice too. I chose not to climb. 
It was 3.1 miles down from the summit to Stratton Pond Shelter. That was my planned lunch stop.  
On the way down I was texting with Papa Big Swig. My socks were wet and my feet were cold. I told him tomorrow I’m bringing an extra pair of socks to change into at lunch time. 
So I arrived at the shelter at 1pm.  I was starving and cold. Dropped pack and began to pull out my food. I was thinking how nice this shelter is when I looked up on a bunk platform to see a completely dry pair of long men’s socks! Oh yes!  The trail provides!  
I left there with a full belly and happy feet!  
It was mostly a downhill hike from there. A couple of hours later I crossed paths with Billy. He’s the Long Trail hiker I met the last time I did a NOBO flip.  He’s doing well. I suggested he stay at the Stratton Pond Shelter tonight. I hope he did. 
Soon the sun began to set behind the mountains. I snapped a photo before the colors disappeared.  
I switched my headlamp to on and night hiked the last hour.  As always, Papa Big Swig was there with a hug and a soda!

",VT route 11/30,"Nov 14, Wed",19.60
Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605323,"I watched the sun come up from the SUV this morning. It was a beautiful bouquet of bright pinks and oranges.  I couldn’t wait to get going! 
It was 10 degrees when I jumped on trail. I was early enough to catch the morning birds in full swing!  It made me happy to hear them sing even when it’s this cold outside!
There was some bouldering going down pretty early on. I find it so much easier on boulders with this iced over snow. Especially going down. I just motor right on down like they’re not even there. It reminds me of a winter in Illinois.  I think it was 1977. Anyway the drifts were as high as fence posts.  They were iced over enough that I could walk right across the top of our fences.  
There were lots of deer tracks this morning.  It got me to thinking that I haven’t heard gun shots today. That’s two days in a row now.  
The trail was over all going up, but with steady easy UP’s & DOWN’s along the way. Then I started the big UP to Glastenbury Mountain at 3750ft elevation.  
I hiked past a partially frozen pond and watched a busy grey squirrel scamper across the forest floor.  Other than my morning birds he would be the only wildlife I see today.
Hiking DOWN in the snow seems to be easier, but hiking UP in the snow can be exhausting. My legs felt so heavy. That’s about the time my spikes got caught on a stick and BOOM...down goes McGinney!  It was the strangest fall. I was thrusted forward like I had been pushed from behind. I landed in the soft snow on my hands and knees. No harm.  
Soon I reached the top of Glastenbury.  Another cool fire tower was up there.  This one wasn’t nearly as iced over as the last fire tower. I really wanted to climb it, but my legs were sooo tired. I did not.  
A short distance down past the summit was Goddard Shelter.  It was already 1pm so I stopped for lunch.  I have no idea what the temp was, but at that elevation it felt bitter cold. Even behind a wall of the shelter my body temp dropped quickly. I was shaking as I took my last bite.   
I knew I had to get my body temp back up, so I literally ran the whole 1.1 miles down that mountain.  My fingers and toes were still a little numb so I trotted another mile for good measure. 
Feeling nice and toasty, I texted Papa Big Swig that I was now ahead of schedule. This was great as today is another long hiking day.  
Then everything went backwards!  I had come to a spot where it wasn’t clearly defined where the trail went. After going off trail a bit and catching a little view between the trees I had to turn back around. There it was...the trail! 
The trail formed a “V” right there and I was at the narrow point. I hopped back on still feeling good. About 1.7 miles later I realized that I hiked myself right back to where I had already been!  Unbelievable!  This is the biggest ROOKIE mistake ever!  
I did this one time before way back in...GEORGIA! You know, when I really was a rookie. Texas and Daddy Shakira saved me that day.  
Needless to say the extra 3.4 miles I just added on put me way behind for what I thought would be an early day. I was so mad at myself. I rarely get mad, but when I do, it’s ugly!  
I had been looking forward to getting to a “lookout” all day long. It was a ridge with a view on both sides. By the time I finally got there the sun was setting. I was still able to see the mountains on both sides, but I hurried through. It temp was dropping fast with sunset, and the wind was whipping across the ridge.  
Here I am night hiking again. The truth is, I usually love night hiking. I especially love it during the winter.  For a good long while I really did enjoy myself out there. Then I got a stick caught up in between my feet. I was on a boardwalk. Yep, down goes McGinney...AGAIN!  That’s it!  I was ready to be done for the day.  
A snow storm was predicted for tonight. I had about 2 miles to go when my GPS began acting up. I knew the snow clouds must be overhead. That’s the only problem I ever have with Guthook’s.  I just had to figure it out on my own during questionable moments of direction. With about 30 minutes left to go the snow started falling.
I love snow but the combination of my headlamp and snow is a problem. Soon I was blinded by the snow. Even still, I could now see Papa Big Swig’s headlights is the parking lot below.  Thank GOD!  
 Making my way down that last half mile proved itself a challenge. There was some bouldering.  The snow had melted making it slightly dangerous to say the least. I wished I could see! 
I had been hearing a water crossing getting closer and closer.  I prayed the whole way down that it was not a big one. Soon enough I was there. This thing was way too large to cross. 
After one more fall, flat on my fanny, I made it to an “island” located in the middle of that water. By the grace of God I managed to make my way down this land mass to a bridge. Then out to a highway. I saw signs to the parking lot where Papa Big Swig was waiting.
I was a hurting miserable mess by the time I reached the SUV. Papa Big Swig asked me why I didn’t come from some other direction...I fell to tears.  This day got the best of me.

I woke up this morning still in pain. My left hip and low back hate me.  Both of my big toes are rubbed raw from wet socks, and my knee is swollen again. Ugh! 
Papa Big Swig firmly put his foot down.  He refuses to let me hike this morning. I only have 14 miles left of Vermont. I guess today won’t be the day. It’s a big bummer for me, but I really didn’t put up much resistance. 
We found an awesome Chiropractor in Williamstown Mass. However, she’s moving her office to North Adams this weekend. Anyway, her name is Dr Quevillon(Dr Q).  She’s amazing!  I’m just throwing it out there for folks who live in the area.  Two thumbs up for her, and her holistic approach!

When I return to the trail, I’m taking one day to slack pack the rest of Vermont, then I’m full packing again!  Papa Big Swig has some business in Florida, and I’ll be on my own for 6 days. 
I’m really looking forward to it!  This will all be new to me. I’ve never camped overnight in these weather conditions before. Though I am considering “shamping”.(Shelter camping) Adding to my challenge is the fact that NOBODY else is out there right now.  I’ll be completely alone.  
We’ll see just how good my survival skills really are! 
I feel like I have a good plan. I’m limiting my miles each day. This means I’m basically hiking from shelter to shelter.  On day 3 I’ll be in a town. If there is lodging I may stay one night there. I can re-supply and do laundry before I head back out. I still need to research hotels/hostels.

My waterproof boots have arrived here at my daughter’s house. Hopefully I’ll be able to keep my feet dry now. Even still, anything can happen. I could slip off a log at a water crossing, step in a bog, or snow drifts can be over the top of my boots. For those reasons Papa Big Swig thinks I should try wearing waterproof socks too. 
Tomorrow I’ll go through my pack and make sure I’ve only got what I need.  I have a tendency to carry things I can do without. I’ll also make sure I’m really 100% winter ready. I’ll line my pack with a contractors bag to help keep wetness out. I’ll also make sure I’ve got my layers as right as I can get them. 
I’m finding layering more difficult than I expected in this colder weather. I’ve worn long johns a few times. They’re great in the early mornings when it’s bitter cold, but by noon I’m usually sweating. It’s not easy or convenient to take off your bottom layer. I’ve actually never stopped and taken them off, I always just deal with the sweat. Not sure I’ll want to get that sweaty when I’m out there for several overnights. Sweat now means freezing later. 
Other than that, we’re getting ready for Thanksgiving. We bought three turkeys today!  I’m looking forward to a great big meal with my precious family!  I am so blessed!  Thankful and blessed. Tiday’s Photo is of my granddaughter Charley Faye.

I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving!  I’ve been enjoying my kids and grands, and thinking about my final leg on the A.T. 
Many thanks to my readers who suggested David Ackerson. He and I have a plan. 
Even better, Big Kahuna is coming for a couple of the days! He’ll hike in with me a little each day, then go back to the car so he can pick me up at the end of my day.  He is THE BEST trail brother ever! EVER! 
Transitioning back into the real world has been in the forefront of my mind. This is not going to be easy. 
I did some Black Friday shopping with my girls. Ugh!  I just couldn’t believe that I used to feel the need to be a part of that madness. It was horrible! Everybody is being inundated with mind altering garble. I won’t ever go again!
We’re doing family photos today, and a big dinner tomorrow.  Papa Big Swig and I will be on the road right after dinner. Speaking of photos  Today is a Picture of our old girl Gypsy Rose.  She didn’t seem to mind the spectacles
I plan to finish up Vermont on the 28th!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605541,"I was up early this morning for my planned 18 mile hike.  This will get me out of Vermont and into Massachusetts!  
When we arrived at my start location the snow was really deep. Our SUV got stuck in the parking lot. Thankfully Papa Big Swig was able to get it out using 4 wheel drive. With more snow falling I quickly realized that I was not going to be able to hike this area today.  
Back to the hotel for a plan B. 
I decided to go south into Massachusetts where the snow wasn’t quite so heavy. This will create a change of plans with my shuttle driver later in the week. Changes changes changes.  
One giant leapfrog later I was at Mass Rt 23 and planning a 12.9 miles hike southbound. The snow was definitely not as deep, and since I’m only hiking 12.9 miles now Seylor gets to come with me!  
It was 10:30 this morning before we stepped foot or paw on the trail. I was so happy to see a winter wonderland!  I enjoyed the beauty all around me while catching snowflakes on my tongue.  
The terrain in the beginning was not bad. The snow was about ankle deep, but I could visualize the trail.  Within the first mile there were two road crossings.  Oddly I watched a snow plow pass by before crossing each one.  
After crossing the second road the trail went UP, and the snow got deeper.  Not only was the snow deeper, but it was sticking to the trees as well. Most white blazes could not be seen. 
 I’m so glad I had Seylor with me.  She has the innate ability to find the trail.  I trust her completely, but there were moments when even she was confused. I spent a lot of time using GPS burning cell battery.  
In two hours I had gone exactly 2 miles.  This is not good.  At this rate it will take until 11pm to go 12.9 miles.  I had to make a plan C.  
Once plan C was in play I felt a ton of bricks come off my shoulders.  No more worrying that I would be feeling my way through this snow after dark. 
Time to have fun!  The temp was in the 30’s. There was no wind blowing so I was comfortable.  Snow was still falling, but lightly. It really was a beautiful day!  
In many places the trail wasn’t visible because ALL of the small trees were bent over from being weighted down by snow. Many of them laying across the trail. I used my trekking poles to knock snow off, and magically they would stand up tall again. Trees rising as I walked by made me feel like I was a princess out there!  
I cannot let all of this snowy white beauty allow me to forget the true danger out here.  I never know what’s under my feet or where my next step might land.  I say this because as I was lost in this Winter Wonderland I took a step on a slab going down, yep down. Just like that...down goes McGinney. OUCH! I had no idea I was about to step foot on a slab. 
Right after the slab incident, I came to an area with lots of trees down.  The trail was so obscure I couldn’t see it. Seylor couldn’t sniff it. I pulled out my Guthook’s app again but it wasn’t acting right.  This happens when there are clouds overhead.  Specifically rain clouds or snow clouds. 
That’s another danger out here in the winter. If I can’t see a trail, and I can’t see blazes, then I must be able to use my GPS. it’s just not a safe.  
With Seylor’s help I made it to a view about a mile from the extraction point. From the view there were footprints going down.  The only sign of life I saw today.  
I was not able to wear micro-spikes today because the snow balled up underneath so badly that I couldn’t walk. I nearly rolled my ankle once. That being said, there was icy slabs going down from the view and down goes McGinney AGAIN!  This time I nearly did the splits.  
Papa Big Swig was waiting patiently for us at the bottom.  It was 4:30pm and just starting to get dark. I had only gone 5.9 miles in 6 hours.    
For the first time today I was forced to consider calling it.  Papa Big Swig had already cancelled his trip to Florida out of fear for my safety. 
The weather has made things dangerous out there.  Big Kahuna is a New Englander and he strongly suggests I don’t go up there by myself anymore. 
I have a lot of thinking to do.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605547,"It was not snowing this morning when Seylor and I hit the trail. I planned to finish the 7+ miles leftover from yesterday.  
What a difference a day makes! The snow has melted off all the trees so every blaze was visible. Some snow had melted on the ground too. Sometimes I was hiking on wet brown leaves again. 
There were several road crossings today.  Seylor had to be leashed up for each one. 
I hiked my way down into Sheffield Mass.  I heard  gunshots on the way down. It’s been a while for that.  I heard them again at dusk. 
The A.T. took us to a cornfield before popping out on a road. I had to put Seylor on her leash again for road walking. We hiked on a bridge over a good sized river. It was flowing rapidly so I stopped for a minute to enjoy it. As I was watching the river flow, I could see mountains in the distance.  What a view! 
The trail turned off after crossing the river. I was hiking the edge of another cornfield that ran parallel to the river. I watched two geese playing on the water. 
Seylor and I hiked by a tree near the river. There was a flock of Quail in it. We must have taken them by surprise because the whole gang took off flying as we passed. 
About a minute after the Quails I watched a really fat grey squirrel climb a tree.  It struck me at that moment that there’s been a lot of small wildlife out today.  That’s what a little sunshine does.  
We came out of the cornfield at some railroad tracks. Just past them was a huge bog. The ATC had kindly built a very nice boardwalk over all of it.  Even Seylor chose the boardwalk. 
I came out of the bog into another field.  Fields are easy hiking, and Seylor loves to run through them! 
We went from that field right into another one. It was almost noon so we stopped on a little hill where the sun was shining and ate lunch. I had egg salad. Seylor had kibble then she licked my dish clean of all egg salad remnants!  
The rest of our hike was from field to field. We went by a pasture of sheep and a field of cows. Seylor was so good. She didn’t bark at them at all. She stayed right on path with me. 
We came to a bridge that was about 5 ft high with only a ladder to get up. Seylor is a good dog, but she hasn’t mastered ladder climbing yet. I lifted her up. She patiently waited for me at the other end to get her down.  
We passed a couple of those man made rock walls. I’ve learned they were used to mark off property such as a field. The amount of labor that must have gone into these walls is definitely noteworthy!  
Soon we popped out on Jug End Road where we waited for Papa Big Swig to arrive. It was a short wait. 
It was only 1:30pm.  This was a great day. I felt I had more in me. So Papa Big Swig took the dogs and moved hotels while I hiked on. 
It was a little over 4 miles hike to the next road. If the terrain was anything like It had been, I would be done in 2 hours. 
I started going UP for what would be my biggest climb of the day.  As I climbed, the snow got deeper.  
I saw deer tracks in the snow and it reminded me of yesterday. On the way back to our hotel last night we saw what we thought was 3 baby deer. As we got closer they didn’t look exactly like deer.  They were much wider than a deer with dark ears.  I decided later they were baby moose. Papa Big Swig saw another one today. He doesn’t think they are moose either.  If anybody out there knows what they are, please leave a message in my guestbook.  
So I continued up Mount Bushnell. This is a relatively small mountain at 1834ft elevation.  But the snow kept getting deeper.  Before I reached the summit I had fallen at least 3 times and trudged through snow that was up to my thighs at times.  Bouldering in snow that deep is difficult. I was moving about as fast as a slug.  
All of that work was worth it. I had several great views! As a matter of fact I would say the second half of my hike was all about the views. 
The sun was setting as I descended Mount Bushnell. I had 2.1 miles left to go in the dark. I had a small DOWN then a big UP to Mount Everett, but I would be getting off the mountain before I reach the summit.  
In the meantime Papa Big Swig realized he cannot drive to my pick up location.  It was gated off and covered with a foot of snow.  So he walked a mile in to meet me.  I’m so glad he did as I would have gone the wrong direction to find him otherwise.  It was 6:30pm  
We walked out together.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605560,"I was awakened a few times last night with leg cramps. They began shortly after I finished my hike yesterday.  That snow is making me use muscles I forgot I had!  
Needless to say I woke up this morning very sore!  Getting out of bed and walking to the bathroom was quite the adventure!  I took 2 Aleve, and eventually I was able to do some stretches and get moving.  
My hike started out going UP.  It was a fun challenge finding the switchbacks in the snow.  I had Seylor Jo with me and she seems to sniff out the trail pretty good.  
There was only about 5 inches of snow, but it still makes the climbs difficult.  My back foot always does a little slip before I can bring it forward.  It’s like doing a forward lunge with every step.  
Going UP in elevation the snow got much deeper. Lots of little trees and pine limbs were weighted down across the trail again today. I giggled a little as I used my trekking poles to knock the snow off and watched them rise up tall again. I thought to myself, this gives a whole new meaning to the word bushwhack!  
I came to a semi frozen bog. There was a single snow covered 2X4 boardwalk going over it. I said my prayers as I did my best to get across without falling into the bog. Prayer worked! 
All of these things were a part of my journey up a big 2000ft hill. It was definitely a mountain of a hill!  I did get off trail a few times up there. It’s so much easier to do with snow covering the trail. I didn’t panic, I just took my time to figure out exactly where I was. That’s a lesson from my dad. 
I’ll always remember my last hunting excursion with him. I was a grown adult in my 30’s. Dad was at least 60 years old. He had bought a hunting dog after several years without one.  I decided one night to go hunting with him. Making our way through the woods we came to a stream with very steep banks. We climbed down the bank to the water. Dad jumped across and climbed up the other side. I jumped across and landed waist deep in the middle of the creek. I was panicking in the dark grabbing for tree roots on the bank. At that moment dad very calmly said “don’t panic sis”. I stopped right then and just stood in the water assessing my situation. He laid on his belly shining his headlight on me and reached his arm down. He grabbed my hand and pulled me out of the water then up the bank. Lesson learned...keep calm during chaos. I miss my dad so much.(forgive me if I’ve already told that story) 
There were several water crossings today. Eventually I crossed a stream on a bridge and ended up hiking beside it  for a good distance. Rushing water was my music for the day. 
At 1:30pm light snow flurries started. I really enjoy the silence of snowfall. I’m always impressed that so much activity can be so quiet. It lasted about an hour. 
I hiked around a partially frozen pond fearing Seylor might try to chase a bird out there.  She didn’t. She stuck to the trail like a good girl.  
With about 3 miles to go I stopped at a creek for water. I haven’t had to use my sawyer for a while. The water was so fresh and ice cold.  I loved it!  
My last 3 miles were eventful. I hiked on some ledges that gave me an amazing view. It’s these moments when I feel closest to God. I thanked him right then. 
I hiked over another bog. This time the boardwalk was pretty dilapidated. You know it...I got a boot full of bog!  The good news is(thanks to a reader) I’ve been wearing roasting bags over my socks, so my socks and feet were spared the muddy mess! 
I hiked down past a cow pasture. Some of these cows had horns! You know I don’t do cows with horns. There was only one little thin wire of electric fence and about 10 feet between us.  Thank goodness the cow closest to me only had little nubs for horns or I would have been an extra 30 minutes bushwhacking my way around! 
Shortly after the cows I could hear traffic buzzing not far away. I put Seylor on her leash and we popped out into a parking area. We had beat Papa Big Swig to the extraction location again!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605568,"I had plans to hike a little over 8 miles today starting in Vermont ending in Massachusetts.  The weather is warmer now. I thought it would be a good time to go back north and finish up Vermont.  
As Papa Big Swig was driving me to my start location,which was at about 2000ft elevation, the snow on the roads kept getting worse and worse. 
They were driveable until we passed a cute little country cottage. (Pictured) About an eighth of a mile past that cottage the roads became impassable.  
We were forced to abandon plan A. I quickly came up with a plan B. It would only be a 5.5 miles hike but the roads were main roads so they should be ok. However, this hike would put me at 3000ft elevation. Snow remained a concern, but Papa Big Swig has bought me some snow shoes.  I’m anxious to try them out! 
Part of our route to my drop off location requires that we drive through Greylock Park.  It was closed. Gated off and everything.  Sigh! 
By now it was nearly noon.  This day has become an unplanned zero.  
It’s becoming clear to me that I’m just too far north to be hiking this late in the year.  I’m so sad. So so sad.  
At this point in time I’ve decided to continue south from where I am. This will leave a 72.7 miles gap.  It feels like a knife in my heart, but hiking these areas right now is a dangerous endeavor. Dad would not want me to take the risk.  I know he wouldn’t. 
The ATC recognizes me at 2000 miles.  I get the same certificate as a thruhiker.  Even though they may categorize me as a thruhiker, we all know at 2000 miles I  am not.  
So here is my plan: 
I will continue hiking south from where I am until I pass the 2000 mile mark.  Then I will go home.  I am returning around March 5th to New York where I will start back northbound until I reach where I stopped for my 2000 miles. Papa Big Swig will then shuttle me back up north to fill in this 72.7 miles gap I’ve created. If I can get it all done on or before March 28, then I will be a TRUE thruhiker and still be in the class of 2018.  
This is not an easy decision. I have fears.  Fears that I won’t be able to get off from work again to come back and finish. I’ll need about 3 weeks to get it done. I know Papa Big Swig will do all he can to help this plan become a reality. 
Even knowing I have his support, I’m still so sad. Sooo heartbroken and sad.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605591,"The one thing that stays the same is that everything changes. Oh how those words fit my life right now!  
One of my readers, Dan, suggested I start at Salisbury and go south from there. I’m taking his advice. That means I’ve now created another gap of 12.1 miles.  At least that’s something I can knock out in one day when I come back.  
It was raining when I started hiking today, and the temperature was much warmer than it has been.  The snow was melting rapidly. 
About 10 minutes into my hike I came around a bend in the trail to see the biggest White Tail Buck I’ve ever seen! He darted off into the woods on my left. Then I looked right, and there was a doe!  A great start to a great day! 
I hiked in, around,  and through a lot of residential areas today. As a matter of fact, I was sort of in someone’s back yard when I saw the deers. Wayyy wayyyy back yard, but I could see houses. 
I followed the backyard path to a little cemetery. I stepped over a pile of “deer raisinettes” on the way.  This was not a military cemetery, but there were lots of American flags out there.  
I walked along the blacktop road to a crossroad. I hiked up that crossroad a bit until I crossed over into the woods and started going UP.  
I was now in the woods for a good while. There was quite a bite of rock today, but I did no bouldering. The one time I would have needed to climb, there was a nice log ladder in place.  
Originally I was planning to hike only 6 miles,  but once I was out there, I decided to do more. What a pleasant hike this was!  
I ate peanut butter crackers for lunch as I hiked up Prospect Mountain. This will be my only climb today at 1461 ft elevation. I have no idea why this is classified as a mountain, but my 2000ft climb the other day was classified as a hill?  It’s befuddling.  
Just as I reached the summit gunfire began to echo. There were 2 shots, then a pause, then a succession of 4 shots. I heard no more gunfire the rest of the day. 
The squirrels were out in abundance today. They are definitely getting their winter fat! Even their tails are big, fat, and bushy. 
I came to a fallen log on the trail.  It was one of those logs that are just the right height for sitting.  The rain had stopped, so I decided to sit. I just sat there and soaked it all in. It’s so peaceful and calming.  
I reluctantly left my log. The forest was busy today. I saw a group of Jays flying around.  I don’t think I’ve seen any Jays since Mount Jackson.
I popped out of the woods to cross a road and past a dam. Just beyond the dam was Great Falls. The water was really rushing from the dam. It was the Housatonic River.  I hiked near or beside that river most of the rest of my hike.  It was nice. 
I came back out of the woods near a residential area called Amesville. Amesville is a “hamlet” of Salisbury.  I thought Hamlet was a Shakespeare play!  Haha
I started across an iron bridge into the hamlet.  When I reached the center of the bridge a little pick-up truck came towards me from around the curve.  I’m sure it was a stick shift as the kid driving put it in neutral revved up the engine and popped it into gear. He pretended he was going to hit me.  Oddly I wasn’t even afraid. He and his buddy started laughing as they each raised their beer can to me and nodded their heads while driving by. He did the same thing on the next curve. I could hear them laughing again.  
I remember saying to myself dear God, please let me get back into the woods before they drive by again.  And then I was there.  
I hiked beside the Housatonic again. I watched a crane take flight from the bank. I love  watching cranes fly up. Their legs seem to take forever to get off the ground and in the flight position. 
Eventually I came out onto a road for the last time.  I hiked past the local high school towards a parking lot. Papa Big Swig picked me up before I reached the lot.  
This day was great!  I have now hiked in all 14 states of the A.T.   Of course I have unfinished business in four of them!  I’ll get’er done!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605607,"I should just stop making plans.  “Go with the flow” is my new motto!  
The weather today was great so I decided to go back north and fill in that little 12 miles gap in Mass. It required a one mile walk to get to the trail. That makes a 13 mile day for me. I’m fine with that. 
It was snowy as I completed my hike up Mount Everett. I probably could have used my snow shoes but didn’t bring them.  MT. Everett is 2602 Ft elevation.  I hiked most of that two days ago, so I only climbed about 500ft of it today. 
When I reached the summit there were four concrete bases left from a fire tower.  There was a sign stating the fire tower was built in 1915 and taken down on 2002.  
The snow was pretty much melted on the summit. That created a lot of water run-off. There were plenty of wet slabs to deal with going down. I chose to sit and slide down one of them, otherwise I stayed on my feet.  
When I reached the bottom I heard a couple of birds chirping as I immediately started my climb up Mount Race at 2365ft. 
There was a ton of water on the way up. Flowing water, and large pools of water.  It’s unbelievable the amount of run-off there is from the snow!   
Summiting Mt Race was awesome!  First I turned around and took a photo of Mt Everett. I love to look back at where I had been.  Soon I came to some ledges that gave beautiful views 360 degrees!  I thought of Hugs.  She LOVED a view! 
I was lost in thought on the way down. I was thinking about how I choose a stopping point before I go home for the winter. I think I really want to finish up Vermont first.  A million thoughts were racing through my mind when the sounds of hammers and saws from below snapped me back to reality.  
I crossed a stream using large flat boulders. I actually said out loud God bless the volunteers who put those huge heavy things there.  
Right past the stream was a fallen tree. The sun was shining right on it. I was hungry so I stopped there for lunch. Tuna salad and Cheetos. 
I was fueled up for my next climb.  A climb it was!  I became a rock climber today as I made my way to the summit of Bear Mountain at 2316ft. It would be a challenging climb anytime, but the continuous stream of water added to the difficulty.  
At the summit was a rock monument with an engraved plaque marking that monument as the highest ground in Connecticut.  It made me think of a doctor I used to work with.  She’s on a mission of visiting the highest point in every state. I wonder if she’s been here yet? 
I was blessed by more beautiful views from Bear Mountain. Who would ever think in December I could be enjoying all of this? 
One last little mountain for me today. Lions Head at 1738ft elevation.  It was quick and easy. 
On the way down I met a couple groups of young people with full packs on. I’m guessing they were 12-14 years old. I was impressed that they’re planning an overnight tonight! 
Soon a saw my little floppy eared girl running towards me.  Gypsy Rose was full of energy today. Papa Big Swig and Seylor Jo were right behind her. We hiked out together.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605624,"Yep, I did it!  I decided to go back and finish up Vermont!  With help from Dave Ackerson I was able to split this last 14 miles into two days.  
Papa Big Swig put it into 4 wheel drive as we went past that same cute little cottage we saw a few days ago. We made it  a bit further this time, and were gifted to see a BIG owl on our way up there. 
I had no choice. If I’m going to do this I will have to walk 1.4 miles up this snowy road to the trail. So armed with my new snowshoes I put one foot in front of the other.  
Papa Big Swig and I had spent the morning packing things up for a move back to the last hotel we were at. So I didn’t get out of the SUV until 10:30 this morning. I stepped my first snowshoe on trail at 11:18am.  
In the beginning the snow was about 18 inches deep. Come on snowshoes do your job! 
There was definitely a learning curve to “hiking” in snowshoes. For example, crossing a bog on a single 2X4 is tricky...and snowshoes are extra heavy when covered with bog!  
Once I figured out the 2X4’s, I spent my first couple of hours truly enjoying the snow!  
I helped several bent over little trees break free from the frozen ground. I do enjoy watching them stand back up tall. In typical Blue Raccoon fashion I wished each one well as I walked away and said “you’re welcome”. 
It really didn’t take long for me to grow a healthy appreciation for my snowshoes!  I can’t believe how much fun they are! The temperature was below freezing so there was a little crust on top of the snow. I just had a blast! Many thanks to Hat Lady for recommending them! 
I saw a lot of deer tracks again today. For at least 2 miles a deer was on the A.T. I followed the same tracks around every twist and turn. I’ve seen this plenty of times. It makes sense that the trail would be easiest to travel on when the snow is so deep, but how do they know it’s there? Nature is amazing. 
I came across several unusual rock formations today.  Basically they were very large square-ish boulders about the size of a pick-up truck resting on several small bowling ball sized boulders. I’m not sure how many I saw, but they were unique. 
When I found a butt sized boulder I stopped for lunch. I started thinking of Papa Big Swig. I am so blessed.  Here I am on the sit-upon he rush ordered for me when I lost my last one. I’m eating the protein snack pack he picked up for me, and wearing the snowshoes he made sure I had.  The list is endless. 
I had 0.3 miles UP from my lunch rock to the Vermont/Massachusetts border. I laughed because I still have an 11 miles gap to fill in of Vermont! 
Just as I was about to reach the border I received a text from Papa Big Swig.  He congratulated me for reaching 2000 miles!  Wow I’ve hiked 2000 miles! Suddenly I felt emotional.  I’m not sure why I cried, but I did. 
It was all downhill from the border. As I went lower the snow thinned out to just a light dusting.  With 1.4 miles left I took off my snowshoes. I hiked beside a flowing creek about a mile of that. 
At 4:38pm I had to turn my headlamp on. It seems to get dark earlier and earlier. My headlamp took me the rest of way out.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605644,"We went back to County Road this morning.  Papa Big Swig dropped it into low gear and drove me the whole way up to the trail. It was exciting and fun doing some real 4 Wheel Driving!  
During our 4WD adventure we saw a woodpecker. It was one of those grey and black ones. He would peck a tree until we got up to it, then fly to the next tree. He did that several times until we finally passed him. 
When I got out of the SUV there were visible little shimmering ice particles floating in the sunlight. Papa Big Swig took a video of it.   It reminded me of dust dancing in a ray of sunlight coming through the kitchen window.  
I went northbound today.  My hike started out going UP.  It was my biggest climb of the day at 3050ft elevation. I was equipped with much needed snowshoes again.  
The hike UP took forever, but I had a great time looking at the bajillion animal tracks!  Wow that hill must come to life when the sun goes down. I saw the most moose tracks I’ve ever seen in one day.  I bet there were 10 or 12 different sets of moose tracks. Hundreds of rabbit tracks! Bird tracks, deer tracks, and coyote tracks!  I really had a fun morning! 
Just as I summited that climb my mind went to Lorax.  I haven’t heard from him in a while. I hope he’s doing ok. 
On the way down there was a clearing for power lines. While I never enjoy seeing things like power lines on the mountains I was grateful for the clearing. It gave me my first beautiful view of the day. 
While I was enjoying my view I heard gunshots. The first and only time today. 
My original tramily(Daddy Shakira, Flower Boy, Feathers, & Texas) and I have been texting a lot lately. They are great people! I’m the oldest and the slowest one of the bunch, but they cheer me on every day. 
Texas has a love for winter hiking. His words made me realize just how much I love it too. Winter is a particularly peaceful time in the forest. I think it’s my favorite season to hike. 
I hiked around a pond today. It was Beaver Pond. There was also a run-off area called Beaver Pond Outlet. Each of them had several single lane boardwalks around them. I mastered those things like a snowshoe pro!  No bog for me today! 
About 7 miles into my hike was Congdon Shelter.  I’ve noticed Vermont rarely has shelters right on trail. So my lunch reservations were made. I was ready for a break by the time I got there. As a matter of fact I had started looking for it 2 miles in advance.  I love hiking in the snow, but it’s physically exhausting. I couldn’t sit down fast enough.  
Lunch was a chicken salad sandwich, chips, and a Twinkie. I was re-energized and ready to go after my nice 20 minutes rest. 
I’m only moving about a mile in 45 minutes on this terrain.  Speed has never been my thing anyway, but I’m usually much faster than that. I found myself bushwhacking a good bit today.  So many trees are bent over and frozen to the ground. I was forced to make my own trail a lot. That cost me time. Needless to say, it was going to be after dark again today. 
My last mile of the day was a steep down to Rt 9.  I had a rough down when I came there on a southbound hike before Thanksgiving. If this side is anything like that side it would not be fun in the dark and now in the snow too.  
It was horrible! The grade is so steep, I couldn’t stay on my feet. I had about 6 falls.  Most of them were a soft landing in snow, but a couple of them hurt.  I landed on a rock with my tailbone once. Somehow I hurt my wrist, and my ankle. I’m bruised on both legs.  
The last one mile took way more than an hour, but I made it, and Vermont is behind me now. There was Papa Big Swig.  I was so happy to see his face.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605649,"Today is the day that we load up to go home for Christmas and for the winter. Papa Big Swig doesn’t want me out by myself in the winter anymore. I honestly feel fine and safe, but he deserves peace of mind too. 
As it stands, I’ve done what I need to do to get my certificate from the ATC. I’ve hiked over 2000 miles, I checked in at Amicalola Falls before I started at Springer. I registered at Harpers Ferry, and in Baxter.  In addition, the weather made me leapfrog, so I’ve actually hiked in all 14 states. Wow that’s a lot!  
Many of my hiker friends have said that I’m a thruhiker. I do feel very good about what I’ve accomplished, but I’ve got a 170 miles or so that I haven’t seen yet. I won’t be satisfied until that happens.  So I’m coming back. 
Mark your calendars for the first week of March. I’ll be back and I’ll be journaling. I’ll probably journal a little in between as well.  For those of you who have been trying to email, my email is fixed!  
Even knowing that I’m coming back, this day is still an emotional one for me. Life as I have known it for so long is changing. I’ll be going back to work and re-joining the rat race.  
I’ll miss my daily dose of tranquility. I remember in the beginning I was looking for “homeostasis”.  I’ve definitely gained a strong sense of self and well being.  
I’ve learned that I’m stronger than I ever imagined I was or could be. My idea of what’s important in life has changed. I’m realizing that I’m more like my father than I thought. That’s a good thing. 
I’m going to give some examples of the kind of man my father was:  He worked from sunup to sundown 6 days a week. He never complained, he was grateful to be able to do it. He ALWAYS took Sunday off. 
He was life smart!  Innately he understood the value of life and humankind. He was one with the earth...and if anybody could “talk” to animals it was him. He understood the nature of all animals and he respected them.  
He respected people and treated everybody like family. He knew no strangers. He was also nobodies fool. He had healthy boundaries in all the right ways. 
He appreciated every day of his life. Lived it to the fullest! He was athletic and competitive, but a good sport win or lose. Though he mostly won. 
He was a natural leader and a teacher in life. 
He always had a smile and he liked a good belly laugh. 
He was brave. Fear never stopped him from doing anything he wanted to do. He was definitely a “when there’s a will there’s a way” kind of person.  
He never took more than an aspirin until the last 6 weeks of his life. Not a single prescription medication ever. He would say “there’s nothing wrong with you until you go to the doctor”.  Being a nurse, I would laugh...but there’s some truth in that!  
He started feeling unwell about a month before his 70th birthday. I knew it was serious when he asked to see the doctor. The first time he ever decided to see a doctor in my whole 42 years of life at that time.  
Shortly after his birthday they did an exploratory surgery and found cancer had attached to every organ in his body.  It was extensive. The surgeon came out and said he had about two weeks to live. Mom and I never told him that. 
When dad woke up his doctor came in with the news. He listened and absorbed it. I could tell he was sad, not mad or upset, just sad.  When the doctor left he looked at mom and he said “I’ll do all I can to fight this, but if it don’t work out, it’s been a good life”.  
That’s my dad. Just grateful to have been given life. He lived about 5 more weeks. He never complained. He left nothing unsaid. When his time came he just closed his eyes and peacefully slipped away. 
When times were hard for me he would say “where’s your faith sis?”  His faith took him all the way home. 
I’d like to end this entry with a few quotes that remind me of dad. 
I always get to where I’m going by walking away from where I’ve been-Winnie The Pooh

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605858,"Since being off trail many things have happened.  Last November we sold our home in Galesburg Illinois. We are officially moving to Paducah Ky where most of the kids and all of the grands are currently located. Though they will soon be scattering again. This process alone has been a challenge.  
To date we have been to one choir concert, one orchestra concert, and one basketball game. These are the joys of being a grandparent! I wouldn’t trade any of that! 
I would however trade a lot of other things that come with being in society. 

More than ever I am now keenly aware of the way media is used to alter individual thoughts. For example making folks believe they need something they really don’t. I still have no TV and probably never will. 
Speaking of “don’t need”. There are very few things in life that I really need.  The nice thing is that I don’t want much more than that either. That’s a change since being on trail. I’m calling it a good change! 
I have been unsuccessful in finding a pair of gym shoes that feel good on my feet. My feet remain a half size larger!  I still wear my boots. 
It’s difficult to find peace. I long to be out there. Where everything just is what it is. 

All of that being said, I do enjoy a long soak in the tub.  I love my mattress, and being in a comfortably controlled climate.  I feel myself getting soft already! 
Wishing everyone a very blessed and merry Christmas!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606342,"Today I visited with our property manager/friend Jay.  He read my journal regularly when I was on the trail. I’m pretty sure he plans to continue reading it when I start back hiking in March. 
He had some gifts for me!  I love them!  The first is a Blue Raccoon doggie toy.  Seylor Jo is a happy girl! 
The second is a Christmas ornament of hiking boots!  This is my favorite!  I will display it all year round. 
He also did some research for me about mom’s phrase “down went McGinty”. I’ve learned it’s actually McGinty not McGinney.  It’s from a very old song. I’m going to post it below.  
Thank you so much Jay!  These things mean a lot to me! 

DOWN WENT McGINTY
Copyright, 1889, by Spaulding & Kornder.
As sung by Sheridan and Flynn.
Last Sunday morning at nine, Dan McGinty, dressed so fine.
Was looking at a very high stone wall;
When along came Pat McCann. says he: I'll bet you five dollars, Dan,
I can carry you to the top without a fall.
On his back he got poor Dan, to climb up the ladder be began,
Until he very nearly reached the top;
But before he'd lose his five, as sure as you're alive,
Let go his hold, not thinking of the drop.
Chorus.
Down went McGinty to the bottom of the wall.
Although he won his five, he was more dead than alive;
With kicks and bruises on his face from such a terrible fall.
Dressed in his best Sunday clothes.
To the hospital they took him. for dead the doctors booked him,
But McGinty gave the doctors a surprise;
Then he began to shout: Say, you blackguards let me out
Although his head was twice its natural size.
To see his wife and child, with joy he near went wild,
He walked along as proud as John, the great;
On the sidewalk was a hole, to receive a ton of coal,
McGinty never saw until too late.
Chorus.
Down went McGinty to the bottom of the hole.
The driver of the cart gave the ton of coal a start;
We were an hour and a half digging McGinty from under the coal,
Dressed in his best Sunday clothes.
When they dug McGinty out, for vengeance he did shout,
The driver of the cart then he spied;
He nicked up half a brick and hit him such a lick
That it raised a carbuncle on his eye.
He then raised such a fuss that the cops got in the muss,
They arrested McGinty for being very drunk;
Next morning the judge did say, no fine you'll have to pay,
Six months you'll sleep upon a prison bunk.
Chorus.
Down went McGinty to the bottom of the jail,
He stayed exactly six, his board it cost him nix;
Six long months, for nobody went his bail,
Dressed in his best Sunday clothes.
When the half year was up they let McGinty out,
He dressed himself as he did in days of yore;
But judging his surprise, he could scarcely believe his eyes,
When he heard his wife had skipped the day before.
To lose his wife and child, with grief he near went wild.
To drown himself he went down on the shore;
And foolishly jumped in, knowing--- well he could not swim,
For water Dan had never took before.
Chorus.
Down went McGinty to the bottom of the sea.
They haven't found him yet, for the water it was wet:
They say that McGinty's ghost haunts the docks at the break of day.
Dressed in his best Sunday clothes.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607628,"My plane from Chicago to White Plains was delayed yesterday. I landed about 10:40pm last night. Papa Big Swig and our granddaughter Charley Faye were there to pick me up. It was after midnight by the time we finally made it to the hotel.  
Charley Faye is our 12 year old granddaughter. She’s hiking this last 168 miles with me! I’m so excited! She’s only ever done day hikes, and not a lot of them. Definitely never in the snow. This will be a challenge for her, but I know she will dig deep and do it. 
Between getting in late and needing to organize a base at the hotel for Papa Big Swig, we didn’t set out with our slack packs to hike until 11:40 this morning. This would be our day #1 NERO. 
We started at a bus garage.  Getting to the trail was 0.8 miles of blue blaze going UP. Being there really brought back memories.  Hugs and I had hiked to that very same bus garage on our last NOBO day before we flipped up to Katahdin. 
We didn’t hit the trail right away though.  One of my readers works at that bus garage and I decided to see if I could find him.  He was working today, but unfortunately had left for lunch.  Sorry I missed you Rich. 
Baby Girl and I eventually found ourselves hiking UP the blue blaze towards the trail.  With her tail wagging Seylor Jo joined us too.  There was 5 or 6 inches of soft powdery snow, and Seylor loves that! 
I didn’t watch the clock, but getting up that “hill” took forever! Baby Girl (now her trail name) had a rough go.  It didn’t seem difficult to me at all, but she even shed some tears.  She sat down quite often, and I began to worry if she would really be my partner in this adventure or not.  
That first UP took us about an hour. I stayed patient, and she kept on pushing. The payoff was great! 
It’s been too long since I’ve seen such a nice view.  We took time for a photo op and she seemed to cheer up. No more tears. 
From there we were pretty much ridge hiking. Nice winter views to the right and beautiful barren mountain to our left. It was calming and rejuvenating at the same time. I loved it! Ridge hiking is my favorite!  
There were two logs coming up. One on each side of the trail. I decided to clear the snow and take a break right there. Just as Baby Girl was walking up she said “look at the sun Nama, it’s so pretty”.  Oh yeah! Got her!  She’s a hiker, hook line and sinker!  
We enjoyed a snack while sitting there on the logs. Good times! 
With only about a half mile left of this NERO, we took our time enjoying the views. Baby Girl saw her first ski slope. She took pictures of the terrain and enjoyed herself. 
Before we expected it, there was the parking space, and Papa Big Swig patiently waiting. 
We can only claim 2.1 miles of trail, but Baby Girl says that 0.8 blue blaze counts!  Ha-ha!  
We have a bigger day planned for tomorrow. I’m trying to ease her into it.  Hopefully by the end of the week she’ll be ready for an overnight.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607671,"We took time this morning to stop back by the bus garage.  He was there!  It’s always fun to meet my readers!  Thanks Rich for following me. 
About 9:30am Baby Girl and I started out NOBO. It was around 16 degrees with 6 or 7 inches of snow on the ground. 
Someone else had recently hiked this area. We were able to step in their footprints, and avoid getting snow in our boots. 
About a mile in we saw some magic. Someone had placed a bowl and package of Ramen neatly along side the trail for any takers.  We left it there for the next hiker. 
The terrain was pretty nice with the exception of a few rocky areas. At one point Baby Girl crawled across on her hands and knees. She has a big fear of sliding down a mountainside. In her defense it was pretty snowy. 
We had a couple small water crossings. On our way to Cat Rocks. We both made it across with no problem. Baby Girl is ever soooo cautious! It sucks up our time, but I try not to complain. I’m just so proud of her for doing this!  
Approaching Cat Rocks, I could see they were snow covered. Rich had mentioned that possibility and suggested we take the blue blaze around them. After Baby Girl’s fear on the previous rocks, I decided his suggestion was good as gold!  Blue blaze we did.  
Looking for a place to lunch, we decided to take the 0.1 mile blue blaze to Wildcat Shelter.  The blue blazes are more like bushwhacking this time of year, but we made it. 
A trail angel had left blankets at the shelter. I sat on one as I ate my lunch. It was genuinely a magical day!  
Blankets or not, it wasn’t very long before both of us were shivering.  We threw our cracker crumbs to a couple of Gray-Jays, and headed back to the trail.  
Less than a mile later we saw another Jay. This was the fattest bird I’ve ever seen!  Like a midget sized turkey!  He got some crumbs too.  
Baby Girl had taken the lead. She was following a set of tracks, and I absent mindedly followed her tracks. 0.6 miles off trail later, my mind returned. YIKES!! 
Since the forest is barren I decided to use my GPS and bushwhack. It was a better option than retracing my steps all the way back. 
Before long our bushwhacking adventure was over and we were back on trail.  
All day we were looking forward to Fitzgerald Falls.  At first we thought it was frozen. I wondered how that could be since there was flowing water in the creek.  Disappointed, we walked on. Just a few yards up there it was. The real Fitzgerald Falls!  It did not disappoint! 
From there we hiked beside flowing water for a long time. That sound is music to my ears. 
I really enjoyed it while working my way up to Mombasha View. 
Mombasha High Point was our biggest climb of the day at 1280ft elevation. We had two great views from that mountain. 
Baby Girl made me laugh on the way up. She said “Nama, I’m so hungry”.  She had to eat right then!  I got a giggle knowing this was her first experience with hiker hunger. It’s a real thing folks!  
We took a 5 minute break for gummy worms...
With fully fueled bellies we made our last push to reach the summit. 
The snow was thick on the way up. We never knew exactly what we were stepping on.  Then I stepped on a slab. I was suppose to be going up, but instead Down Went McGinty! I’m changing the spelling to McGinty because I’m pretty sure that’s really what mom was saying. The T is just silent in her version.  
Thanking God for no injuries! 
We enjoyed the view from the top for a brief moment then began the 1 mile trek downhill to Papa Big Swig. We followed a set of deer tracks the whole way down.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607720,"We were up and at’em early this morning. I was ready for a 12 mile day, but Baby Girl was not. She’s currently taking antibiotics for a sinus infection, and it seems they have upset her tummy. She vomited before we even left the hotel. 
This will be a Blue Raccoon day. 
The first quarter mile or so was fairly flat. Flat but snowy. I’m guessing there was 8 or 9 inches of soft powdery snow.  Immediately I wished I had grabbed my snow shoes. 
After that quarter mile I came to my first big climb of the day. Wowzers! I was bouldering up high over snow covered boulders.  It was challenging to say the least. I had to throw my poles up ahead then feel through the snow for handholds and footing to pull myself up. 
I was hoping that would be my biggest challenge for the day. Hahaha! Wishful thinking on my part!  Basically the next 4 miles were UP.  Lots of that UP was bouldering, and most of it was covered in deep snow. 
I remember thinking it might be a good thing that Baby Girl stayed with Papa Big Swig today. This was a lot! That’s also when it struck me that I would reach the Lemon Squeezer today. 
NO!  I cannot do the Lemon Squeezer without Baby Girl!  
Just like that, I decided to hike only 5 miles today. 
During my UPs and DOWNs(mostly UPs) I had 3 or 4 little water crossings. Then I came to a large water crossing. This was part of Little Dam Lake. From a distance it looked like I was going to have to cross barefoot, but when I got all the way down to the water, I found a way across.  Boots on!  
For lots of reasons I really enjoyed hiking near the lake today. 
First, the sun was so bright right there. It seemed like the only job the sun had to do today was to warm that lake. Every now and then I would hear a pop when pieces of ice would melt enough to break away from the rest. 
Secondly, the greenery around the lake was nice to see. Not just evergreen trees, but bushes and lichen. Proof that Spring is coming!  
Lastly, the snow had melted enough that brown leaves from last fall were poking through in spots. I liked listening to them crunch below my boots.  
Yes the lake was a great place, but soon I started my trek up Arden Mountain at 1015ft elevation. 
OH MY GOODNESS! I went UP forever!  Talk about feelin’ the burn!  My glutes are still on fire.  
My calf muscles are a mess too!  Hiking up hill in the snow really stretches those calves. With every step up and forward my back foot gives a little slip backwards. It pulls the heck out of my calves. 
Somewhere up there I saw my first rock cairn since coming back. I love seeing them. They make think of a strong guardian standing there protecting me.  And in there own little way, that’s what they do. 
I said goodbye to my guardian friend and began my journey down.  It was equally as difficult as going up!  Bouldering down in the snow at that decline grade was tedious. A few times I chose to sit on my butt and just slide down large slabs.  It took an eternity to do, but I made it to the road unscathed. 
Before me was a sign for Harriman State Park.  Papa Big Swig and Baby Girl we’re waiting in a parking place just up the road. 
Today was a challenge, but I finished up just in time to go out for lunch with two of my favorite people.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607774,"We hopped out of the SUV about 8:25 this morning. Myself, Baby Girl, and Seylor Jo started out going UP.  I think it was about 600 ft of up. That doesn’t sound like a lot until you start hiking it in the snow. 
We had fun with it though. There were a few switchbacks, and the snow was so pretty. Even the little bit of bouldering was fun. 
About 2 miles in we came to the Lemon Squeezer. This is a monumental marker on the A.T.  It’s a crevasse of sorts creating a very tight squeeze for hikers to get through. It is also on an incline and a collector of ice!  
If we had been full packing we definitely would have needed to drop pack to get through. Our slack packs were no problem. 
I went first. One step up... slide all the way back down on the ice. Two steps up...slide all the way back down again!  Hmmm
Eventually I was able to put pressure on both sides of the crevasse.  With my hips and shoulders, and a lot of muscle I made my way up.  
Once I was up there, I was able to wedge myself against a boulder and extend my trekking pole down to Baby Girl. Zip zoom we got her up. 
It didn’t get any easier. Right in front of us was a tough boulder climb.  I could get up and pull Seylor up by her harness, but it was a no go for Baby Girl. We had to blue blaze around. 
It was UP from the Lemon Squeezer. Not a difficult UP, just a nice steady incline.  The snow was kind of hard up there making it easier hiking. Rhododendron bushes were up and were covered with green leaves. Spring is really springing! 
At the top was a big ole raven making a raucous. He was making a scene cawing loudly. He would also be the only wildlife we see today. 
Just a few yards past the raven was our blue blaze taking us to Fingerboard Shelter...and lunch! 
Fingerboard Shelter was a really nice Shelter made of stone with two fireplaces built right in.  Someone had obviously camped there last night. We could still smell the fire. 
Leaving the shelter we were  hiking UP again.  Hiking with a twelve year old is a blast!  She had been trying to make up a hiking song for us. “Our song”. We’ve got one now. It’s called UNSTOPPABLE. It’s the cutest little song and we had so much fun making it up.  
About the time we finished our song we began going DOWN. We could see a couple of round buildings at the bottom. One was a water tower and we’re not sure what the other one is. It looked like a round yurt with a brick base. 
Just past the water tower was a logging road. We couldn’t see the loggers, but we heard them and smelled the scent of burning wood as it was being cut. 
Maneuvering ourselves around log piles we made our way across the road, then back into the snow on a downhill trajectory.  
For a short distance we could see brown flecks of bark in the white snow.  Baby Girl, who has been dealing with hiker hunger, just cracked me up! She said Nama those brown flecks in the snow looks like a Vanilla Bean Frappuccino from Starbucks!  
Never a dull moment!  
With only a couple hundred yards to go we made our way to the road where Papa Big Swig would pick us up. 
We were 40 minutes early

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607855,"Baby Girl and I got an early start.  The plan was for a 10 mile day. Papa Big Swig dropped us off then drove around to our evening pick up location only to find the road was gated off. This happens from time to time on the A.T.  We were forced to change plans to only 7miles again today. I really need to increase my mileage soon.  
We spent the morning checking out trees and rocks. Baby Girl was on a mission today to take a photo of unique rock formations. We drew a smiley face in the snow on a big boulder for one photo.  She also found a missing president from Mount Rushmore. She decided it was Donald Trump because of the bad comb-over. We laughed a while over that. 
She had a rough day today. Three or four falls, and a lost hat.  She went back a quarter mile to retrieve her hat. I waited. 
We reached the top of a big hill to find another raven squawking about something.  They are the noisiest birds.  
The trail was busy today. Weekend warriors were taking advantage of this great weather. 
We talked with a couple of weekend/section hikers. One guy is trail named Stacks. I can’t remember the other one.  They were the first of many hikers we would run into today. 
We hurried on down to William Brien Memorial shelter. Baby Girl was hoping for a privy, but we got a boy scout troop instead. 
They had sheltered there last night and none of them were raring to go. We had good conversation with the leaders who were impressed with the miles I had put out last year. Even though I will be taking my through hike to the very last possible minute. 
Leaving the shelter we hiked past several groups of Japanese hikers.  All ages were enjoying the park and the trail. I was so impressed with the amount of senior citizens out there... I mean very senior, senior citizens.  
Then I had my own senior moment. Baby Girl and I had been looking up in the trees to get a picture of a squirrel nest. We kept following the footprints in the snow and looking up. 
Finally we found one, a really big one, 3/4 of a mile OFF TRAIL! Unbelievable!  I did it again!  
The upside of being off trail is that we hiked beside Silver Mine Lake. It was a frozen splendor to view, and worth the extra mileage. 
Going off trail was all downhill so getting back on trail was all uphill. Then we immediately began our climb up Black Mountain at 1187ft elevation. 
There were a couple of tricky places but over all not a bad climb. We shared the summit. This was the first of at least 8 amazing views today!  
There was a fair amount of bouldering down. Baby Girl still gets nervous on steep downs. Snow and slush covered boulders are hard. But she’s a trooper, and slowly but surely she made her way.  I’m so proud of her!  
We crossed a 4 lane road and headed back up into the mountains.  It was there when I started to notice the insect world. First there was a bug right on trail. Alive,  making it’s way across trail on the snow.  I’m not sure, but I think it was a Box Elder bug.  Then we saw a different little insect on a rock, and eventually there were a couple of little flying things in the air.  More proof that Spring is on its way! 
We continued on enjoying the many many views. Today was View-mazing!  
We saw a couple of hawks as we made our way down the last mountain. 
Papa Big Swig was patiently waiting for us in the parking lot below.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607857,"The weather today is less than desirable. A ZERO day it is! I like to take Zero day journals to explain unanswered questions.  
Today I’m going to focus on money. 
If I’m being completely open, I should tell you that I have spent more than triple my budget on this hike.  Mostly that’s because Papa Big Swig and I decided to do the last half of my journey as a team of sorts. He is my better half, and it’s been fun! 
During the fall months he pulled our camper and stayed in campgrounds close to where  I was hiking. Most of the time I could come down to a pick up location and sleep in a warm camper at night. This was a fairly inexpensive plan. 
Then the snow came and campgrounds closed. We were forced to use hotels as a base.  Hotels can be costly. In addition, we have dogs.  
Dogs create another lodging issue. Many hotels do not accept pets, but some do. The hotels that do, charge a pet fee. That’s where we are now. 
The campgrounds have not reopened yet, so it’s hotels or nothing for us. Even the cheapest of hotels with a pet fee is $100+ a night.  
That being said, you can certainly imagine the joy I felt when Big Kahuna called to gift us a week long stay at his timeshare in Pittsfield Mass!  
That will be my next base of operation.
 He’s such an awesome trail brother!  This gift will save us about $700. I don’t even know what to say, I just love that guy!  Tramily for life! 
The next money question is income? How do we earn money while on this adventure? 
Papa Big Swig does I.T. work from home. As long as he can get high speed internet access he can work from anywhere. His company is based out of NYC. This week, he could literally drive to the office every day If he wanted. I think the sign said 34 miles to NYC. 
As for me... I’m a trauma nurse. I’ve been doing contract ER work for 4 or 5 years now. However, I think I might be done with hospitals and ER’s. 
We winter in Florida every year. I usually take a 13 weeks contract in an ER down there each winter. But this year I didn’t have 13 weeks to give.  I knew I was coming back to the trail in early March. So instead I took high-tech pediatric home health cases. I still contracted myself out, but it was basically shift to shift. I had plenty of work, and It was great!  Not to mention that I fell in love with all of those little cuties!  
It might be time for a permanent professional change. 
Lastly,  I just want to say how much it means to me to have Baby Girl along for the fun.  She’s not really an outdoors person...she says.  But everyday she finds herself in awe of God’s creations. She asks really good questions, and even starts planning for the next day. She makes my heart happy!  
143.5 miles left to go on this grand adventure!  I’m loving every minute of it! 
Until Next Time

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607921,"First and foremost, Happy 14th birthday to our grandson Josh!  We love you and are so proud of you!! 
Right away I realized I should have worn my micro-spikes today.  The sun came out nicely and it really warmed up to nearly 50 degrees, but it turns out that only makes the melting snow and ice worse when you’re up high.  
Baby Girl took the lead right out of the gate.  Our first climb would be Bear Mountain at 1305ft.  The trail in that area had been re-routed some and I followed her right around the base of that mountain instead of up and over. 
It was odd. There were old faded out blazes here and there. I said something isn’t right here, but then we saw fresh blazes going up Bear Mountain.  
So UP we went. Up up up the snow covered icy steps. Reaching the top I still felt off. One look at Guthook’s and I’m realizing we completely hiked up the backside of Bear Mountain and are now hiking southbound.   WHAT?!?  In a million years that has probably happened only once...and it was to me!  
We had gotten off to an early start this morning so Baby Girl and I caught a beautiful sunrise while up there.  There’s nothing like sharing a glorious sunrise with your granddaughter! I didn’t even care that we had steps to retrace.(again) 
So we finally got back on track.  Working our way down Bear Mountain proved itself to be a challenge. I was using the edges of the rock stairs to step down. They had a bit of snow melted off and I could find footing with the toe of my boot. That’s when it happened. Black ice...down went McGinty. 
I landed on my left butt cheek, hard, clear to the bone. Pain radiated to my left hip, down my left leg, and clear to the knee.  I just laid there on those rocks.  
Once I got up, Baby Girl being only 12, had a little chuckle over my “butt” pain.  That’s when it happened to her.  She went down on the rocks too.  I don’t think she’ll laugh again.  
We collected ourselves and continued our journey much more cautiously. 
We came upon a small waterfall.  Baby Girl was in awe! I loved it!  She’s starting to hear the music.  She enjoys the sounds of flowing water, and chirping birds! I’m sooo HAPPY!  
Once we made it all the way down, we found ourselves at Bear Mountain Inn.  It was only 10:30 am but we were ready for lunch. 
It was nice inside. Everything inside and out was made of stone and wood. Baby Girl and I both had a Nathan’s hotdog with chips and a pop.  It hit the spot! 
Today’s hike took us right through a zoo!  On the way to the zoo we saw many fat squirrels, but one in particular caught our attention.   He was running around with food on a stick!   It looked like chicken on a stick!  
We were still having a good laugh about that when we entered the zoo.  This zoo helps injured animals. There was a 3 legged fox (trail named Hoppy), a one legged goose, a coyote with stitches, and several other animals. Not all were injured. There was a couple of bears, a bobcat, and lots of fishes, snakes and turtles.  We really enjoyed ourselves there and left a little donation in s box at the exit. 
Immediately leaving the zoo we started walking on bridge across the Hudson River. It was a really big suspension bridge!  The river was beautiful!  
We crossed a road and eventually ducked back into the woods. This began our icy ascent up Anthony’s Nose. The ice made it a real “booger” to climb!  Haha!  We had plenty of nose jokes!  
From there it was just a few miles with little UPs and DOWN’s.  
Finally we reached our last big down and made our way to the Appalacian Market.  Papa Big Swig was patiently waiting for us there.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607962,"I had a rough night trying to sleep last night. Yesterday’s fall has me aching.  Nonetheless I was up early and hit the trail about 7.40am.  
The snow was crunchy underneath my boots. After melting some yesterday it had frozen over the top again through the night. I was armed with micro-spikes today! 
It was myself, Baby Girl, and Seylor Jo enjoying today’s adventure.  Right away Baby Girl saw a deer.  It was running away. From that moment on there was almost never a time when we couldn’t spot deer tracks. 
 
Our hike took us past another rock wall. I was thinking to myself, those walls have got to be over 100 years old.  And I truly cannot imagine the man hours put into it.  
We had several water crossings today. Most of them were good sources if we had needed water.  The melting snow is doing its job. 
We climbed up Canopus Hill 808ft. The trail took us across a country road up there to a place where lots of rock walls were at.  We chose one and sat down for lunch. Seylor carries her food, so she dined too. 
The trail today was a consistent mix of UP and DOWN. Nothing big either direction. It should have been an easy day, but my hip was killing me!  I decided to take some Tylenol. 
I opened my fanny pack to find that my pill pouch had fallen out. It must have happened at lunch. I had contemplated taking some then, and pulled it out, but I thought I had put it back. Ugh!  Baby Girl had Advil, but I took an anti-inflammatory this morning and can’t have anymore. 
I hiked on... what else is there to do?  
For a bit we hiked beside a flowing creek. It’s still music to my ears. Occasionally I could hear the chirp of busy birds.  At one point I looked up to see a beautiful Hawk circling above. It was nice. 
Papa Big Swig brought some Tylenol to a parking lot I had to cross. I had planned to send Seylor home with him while me and Baby Girl did 4 more miles. 
As I was hiking the 2 miles towards him, I decided I was ready to call it a day myself. Only 8.7 miles.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608037,"We got off to an early start this morning.  As Baby Girl and I made our first climb we caught the last few minutes of another beautiful sunrise.  
The terrain today was much like yesterday.  A constant mix of little UPs with little DOWNs. It’s down to 2 or 3 inches of snow at max. Theres a lot of barren ground showing through now too.  Another 3 or 4 days and the snow will be all but gone. 
One of our early morning DOWNs brought us to an old mountain road. From this road we could hear the rushing water  from a nearby waterfall and at the same time morning birds were chirping joyfully.  The sun shone down right there, and that moment was filled with splendor. Baby Girl was in awe once again. I cannot tell you how much I love the moments when she’s just blown away by God’s natural wonders!  She didn’t want to leave that space...I didn’t either. 
All too soon we had to get moving again. We started back up with a Little bouldering. The snow IS melting more and more every day. That melted snow freezes over into ice every night.  That’s what was on these boulders. A lot of black ice!  
We put positivity into action and threw it out into the universe that we were NOT going to fall today!  That was our mantra as we hiked our fall free day!  My hip isn’t ready for another one yet. 
On the top we both caught the faint scent of pine. That scent came and went all day. It makes for a pleasant hike. 
We had a good bit of ridge hiking, but at one point we found ourselves hiking on top of a man made rock wall. This one was more modern. I’m pretty sure it was a retention wall of some sort. 
Eventually we crossed over a major roadway and into Fahnestock State Park. The trail right there took us around Canopus Lake. It was frozen and beautiful.  
We came upon a couple of sawed off tree stumps. The sun was shining right on them. So inviting...LUNCH!  It was the perfect spot.  
This afternoon we enjoyed a little wildlife. The temp was up to 43 degrees and the critters are getting busy. We saw a chipmunk scurrying around the forest floor.  Baby Girl loved it!  There were also lots of birds and a few squirrels. Every afternoon this week I’ve seen a hawk. I just love seeing wildlife. 
As we were preparing to start our climb up Shenandoah Mountain we heard gun shots. Hmmm I don’t believe anything is in season for hunting right now. 
I do know the deer are out in droves. We followed one of many sets of deer tracks right on up that mountain.  It was a long slow steady climb to the summit at 1282ft 
There were a couple of good views on the way up. I remember looking down at the frozen lake thinking my dad would love this day. It’s technically winter, but it’s warm. Spring is in the air. I had a clear picture in my mind of my dad. He was mushrooming and smiling with every morel he put in his bag. 
When we reached the summit we found that someone had painted an American flag right on top. It was partially snow covered,but the bright red, white, and blue could still be seen where the snow was thin and melting. 
There was a little bit of bouldering going down, but mostly it was just a pleasant hike. 
Before we knew it, there was the parking lot where Papa Big Swig would pick us up.  We only waited about 3 minutes before he arrived. He’s like Old Faithful, I am blessed.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608146,"I woke up super excited for this day. Baby Girl and I will be full packing and overnighting on the trail tonight.   
We got on trail by 7:15am. Baby Girl hit the ground running.  She was the leader pretty much all morning. 
She hiked us right up to Ralph’s Peak Hikers Cabin. I’ve been there before. In 2016 myself, Papa Big Swig, and our grandson CJ were trail angels at that shelter.  
I met my very first through hiker there. His name was Zorko.  He took some blueberries and fresh water. I remember feeling like I was talking to a movie star!  
The privy there is nice.  Stocked with TP and everything! 
I came out of the privy to find Baby Girl in tears. She had called her mom and told her she was scared to overnight. It’s too late now, she’s out here. I really wasn’t very sympathetic.  
We hiked on and she cheered up as a big skein of geese came honking by.  
This part of the forest was a little depressing. Many many trees were down. It was like a tree graveyard. The graveyard went on for a couple of miles. I wondered if there had been a blight, or maybe even tornado type winds. Several of them were just uprooted lying on the. ground.  Whatever it was, it made me sad.  
Eventually we hiked out of the graveyard and started up Hosner Mountain.  On the way up we had a great view of some beautiful New York farmland.  
Then we carefully came down, and waited for Papa to bring us a couple things we had forgotten.  
It was a nice little visit. We sat in the vehicle and ate our lunch.  He had brought us pop to drink.  I love that guy!!  
From lunch we started going UP.  There were switchbacks, but our full bellies, and full packs left us huffing and puffing during the climb.  
The next couple of miles gave us a few unique things to look at.  Baby Girl had never seen a tree growing right up out of rock before. She was intrigued. 
We also saw a field fully lined with rock walls. There have been more rock walls than ever in this part of my hike. 
A lot of the snow is melted now.  However, it seems every one of our UPs are snow covered.  
We were just finishing an up on some boulders when we ran right into a lone hiker. He said he was just out for the afternoon, and said were only 6 or 7 minutes from our shelter. 
After full-packing all day we were so happy to drop pack at Morgan Stewart Shelter.  We quickly found the water source, filled our bags, and set up camp. 
As the sun went down, the wind picked up. I’m not sure how low the temp dropped, but it was cold with all of that wind. To help block the wind, we decided to “shamp”.  That’s Shelter Camp.  We pitched our tent right inside the shelter. 
On a Thursday, in the winter time during a wind storm,  I never in a million years imagined we would have visitors at the shelter with us...but we did! 
In the midst of this wind here came two hikers. They had parked their car about a mile north and were planning a little A.T. adventure.  
We had pitched our tent off to one side so thankfully there was plenty of room.  One of our visitors was trail named Bacon. He was a through hiker last year.  
Bacon and I had trail talk while his buddy built a roaring fire in this wind.  I was a little concerned, but they both tended to it properly.  
Baby Girl and I said goodnight early.  We climbed in our tent and were asleep shortly past hikers midnight, 8pm.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608188,"I woke up at 2am to potty. I stepped out of my tent to see the two hikers who joined us last  night had left!  They must have walked the 1 mile back to their car. It was super windy, and I didn’t feel like they had the right clothing for overnighting. 
Packing up and getting breakfast took forever. This was Baby Girls first overnight, and she had no system.  
It was 9:05am before we stepped a foot on trail. 
We carefully hiked down to that same parking place where our two visitors had parked their vehicle the night before. There was Papa Big Swig!  He took our big packs, gave us our slack packs, and my dog.  After a quick run for pop we were on our way.  
Baby Girl took the lead. She’s become quite the hiker!  After all of those tears about overnighting, she had a blast! She’s already planning for our next one.  
The terrain wasn’t horrible today regarding UPs and DOWN’s, but the ice and melting snow made everything slippery. I went down a boiler just right, and BOOM!!! Down went McGinty. Baby Girl laughed as my poles went flying right off my wrists.  I hurt my ribs.  
It was lunchtime when we came to a wooden bridge. There was a handrail on one side and just open bridge on the other. 
The sound of rushing water was so inviting!  We let our feet dangle off the side of the bridge and enjoyed our PB&J right there. Seylor had a pouch of chicken with some dry food. 
We saw another hawk after lunch. I’ve been trying to get a hawk picture in flight. I’ve decided it’s impossible.  I have several of him sitting in a tree. 
Our very next DOWN after the hawk was a rough one. Snow is melting, but there’s still just enough ice to make it dangerous. Baby Girl went down and it brought her to tears. She’s tough like Nama though. She stood up and shook it off. We hiked on. 
There were many water crossings today. Seylor loved them all!  She especially loved Nuclear Lake. It was semi frozen, and she went for a little swim.  It had to be soooo cold, but she cane out tail wagging!  
Hiking around Nuclear Lake was nice. There was a cool breeze coming off the lake. I enjoyed that very much as it had turned into a hot hiking day. 
There’s always wildlife activity around water too. We watched a big group of sparrows take to flight, two ducks chase each other, and another skein if geese fly overhead.  
From the lake we turned away and started going UP. We heard gunshots again. They actually got closer and louder. Lots of gunshots.  I finally decide they were close enough that I should yell. I did yell.  I yelled “WE ARE HIKERS OVER HERE!” I yelled several times.  Baby Girl was scared. We met a local SOBO day hiker and she was a little rattled too. It felt unsafe so I called the police.  
I’m not one to just call the police,  but we weren’t sure if we should hunker down and hide, or get out of there.  
Turns out we were right beside a gun club. I was a little embarrassed, but they were kind to me on the phone.  We all went about our merry ways in a much happier mood! 
Just before we made it to our pickup location we had to walk through a swamp of sorts. It was a very large area of about ankle deep water with large chunks of ice floating in it. 
To be honest, that cold wetness felt good on these sore feet.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608219,"We intentionally got off to a late start today. Papa Big Swig will be relocating is to a time share in Massachusetts while we hike. Long story short we had to do some creative thinking to work out the timing. 
So at 11:30am Baby Girl and I were boots down. Right away we heard gunshots, but neither of us were concerned this time. 
We hiked through some pastures and into the woods. Several day hikers were out today. The weekend always  brings company to the trail.  
We crossed paths first with an Asian man. He had a full pack on, and was also carrying a duffel bag by hand. That’s so unusual!  I just had to ask! He said he’s camping and these are his camping things.  
We also crossed paths with a bird watcher, a father and son along with their dog Harper.  Harper looks a lot like Seylor Jo.  A group of kids, and two or three single hikers.  Everyone was pleasant on the trail.  I have found that to be true in every state along the way. 
We crossed Swamp River on a very long elaborate boardwalk.  It was very nice. There were beautiful cattails and tall grasses that look like wheat. We moseyed along enjoying the beauty. 
Eventually the boardwalk ended and we came out to a road. Across the road started another series of fields.  The first field was empty except for a good amount of deer poop. 
The second field was a grazing pasture for cows. Lots of cows!  AND they were all herded up right by the blaze! 
Ok Blue Raccoon there are no horns in site, and you can’t act like a chicken in front of Baby Girl!  One slow deep breath, and I was over the fence.  Praying silently the whole way, I kept Baby Girl farthest away from the cows, and I bravely hiked right through that field!  
I was quite relieved when we crossed over the fence on the other side. The next field was empty, and the sun came out from behind the clouds for a while. It felt nice and warm right there, so we got out our sit-upons and had lunch.  
From our lunch site on, the trail became a steady flow of small UPs and small DOWNs. Most of the snow is gone so there was either mud or brown leaves from last fall below my boots.  Both are better than ice! 
The unmistakable aroma from a skunk accompanied us for about a half mile to the Wiley Shelter. Hikers had built a fire at the shelter, and that definitely helped disguise the skunk scent.  
It was downhill from the shelter to a stream. We hiked beside that stream a good distance. It became quite wide and the sound was so relaxing.  I’m sure the melting snow has increased  water levels in the creeks. It makes for nice music to hike to.  
A group of crows were squawking just as we came out onto another road. We crossed over and about 20 yards down was the sign. Welcome to Connecticut! Yay!! Baby Girl and I took one giant step together across the line as we said adios to New York.  
Less than a mile away Papa Big Swig picked us up.  He says our new place is awesome!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608281,"We hopped on trail about 8 o’clock this morning. It was 26 degrees outside.  At the time it seemed as though ALL of the snow was melted. 
Right away we started going UP.  Our first climb was Ten Mile Hill at 1000 ft elevation.  We listened to morning birds as we made our way up.   
The trail took us by Ten Mile River. We chose to take a blue blaze to Ten Mile Shelter. The shelter space was exceptionally nice. There was a picnic table, a nice bench, and a good privy.  There was also a nice bit of cleared land. Baby Girl laughed when I said “this is a swanky place”!  
We took a little break before hiking on.  The strangest thing happened. We crossed the river on a big bridge. Suddenly Baby Girl noticed the river was flowing a different direction.  That’s impossible, I know, but it sure was!  I had no explanation and was completely perplexed. 
We hiked on and met a trail maintenance volunteer. His name is Ray, but his trail name is “Trails”.  Very nice guy.  
After some trail talk I finally told him about this strange occurrence. He explained that the first creek we saw actually dumps into this river and when we crossed the bridge we were actually looking at a different body of water. Thank you Jesus! I felt much better.  
We spent far more time talking to Trails than we could afford. So off we went anticipating our first big climb of the day. 
We hiked beside that river for a good while. It had nice roaring rapids. I loved the cool mist and fresh scent. And of course I loved the calming sound of rushing water. Ahhhh bliss.
We made a turn to the left and soon we were climbing Indian Rocks. This climb was 1316ft elevation. 
It was a long exhausting climb, but the payoff was priceless!  We had two amazing views going up, and more going down.  
The rest of the day was like this, big climb...amazing views...big climb...amazing views. 
The climbs were tiring, but Baby Girl and I played alphabet games making time and distance go by quickly. You all know the games, A my name is Anna, I live in Albuquerque, and so on.  We got to laughing so hard out there. Baby Girl got the letter E and decided her name was Eeyore! She insisted it IS a name!  Hiking with a 12 year old has been a blast.  
Two times we briefly got off trail. Both times we were suppose to turn, but there was not a double blaze. Not only that, but there were old blazes that were faded, but still could be seen going the wrong direction. I wish I had written down the mileage number.  I could have contacted Trails somehow.  
We finally reached our last summit of the day to find our entire descent was completely covered with ice. Ice AND snow to be exact.  I couldn’t believe it. Going down was painstakingly slow.  
On the way down we found a snake skin. It was in very good condition so I can only assume it’s a recent molting. Seems awful cold and early to have snake activity, but there it was. 
Baby Girl had taken one hard fall, but we both made it safely to the bottom. There was almost no snow or ice down there. 
We had one fairly large water crossing down there, then quickly made our way out to the road.  As always my knight in shining armor was patiently waiting for us.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608335,"I had full intentions of hiking today, but with almost zero sleep last night, this day became a zero too. My sciatica is driving me crazy!  
I have a chiropractor friend near here and I saw her today. It is definitely improved.   Praying for sleep tonight. 
I’ve recently been asked where do I live.  That’s a good question! 
We sold our house in Illinois November 2017. I am from Illinois. However, we also own a condo in Florida where we spend our winters. We started doing that about 4 years ago when the youngest went off to college. 
So long story short, we sold our house in Illinois November 2017. We went to Florida for the winter, then I started my hike March 2018. I literally hiked until December 2018.  You guessed it, it’s time for Florida again!  
Most of the kids live in or near Paducah Kentucky so that’s probably where we will end up, but rather than buying something quickly we rented an apartment when I got off trail in December. At least we got our things out of storage.  
So now we have a one year lease and can take our time looking for a home.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608415,"We had a planned late start this morning. We began by going up over a fence and through a small field to a water crossing. It was a fairly large creek with a nice footbridge.  
I have no idea why, but Seylor has become leery of bridges.  Instead of coming up and over she went right into the water. It got so deep that she had to swim with her pack on. She made it across, but the bank was too steep to get up. I made her come back. More swimming for her in ice cold water. I stood on the bridge and very firmly said “come”.  She’s such a good listener!  I could tell she was nervous, but she came.  When she got to the other side she did some celebratory tail wagging and hopping around. 
Baby Girl and I stood on the bridge a bit longer singing our newest song we made up.  It’s another cute one. We have so much fun out here! 
The real hike began right after the footbridge...going UP! 
We played one of our alphabet games again. Time and distance goes by so much faster when you’re having fun! 
Baby Girl was ready for lunch a little on the early side. We were just coming to a steep ascent so some fuel at that time would be a good thing. We pulled up a log in the sunshine and enjoyed a turkey sandwich. 
Seylor was just returning from chasing a squirrel all the way up a mountainside.  She literally flopped down on her belly from exhaustion. AND no squirrel to show for all of her efforts. She was happy to get fresh water and food too. 
Caleb’s Peak was staring us straight in the eye. We began to climb the 1118ft to the summit. It was long and has us winded, but a nice climb.  
We spent some time up there soaking up a bit of God’s handiwork!  Baby Girl sat on a rock in the sunshine and just gazed out with such a peaceful look on her face.  This makes me so happy. 
We had to force ourselves to move on.  And so the very rocky descent began.  At first it was simple but very quickly turned into steep bouldering.  
About halfway down was St.John’s Ledges. Another great view!  Today’s photo is of Baby Girl & Seylor enjoying that view. We saw another Hawk up there. Once again we didn’t want to leave. 
From the ledges it took a while. Baby Girl maneuvered slowly and cautiously. Seylor Jo had to be lifted and eased down several times. It was not an easy descent, but we all three made it safely to the base of Caleb’s Peak. 
I would never have chosen that area for Baby Girl if I had a choice, but she sure has turned into a hiker! 
There was a significant change in terrain down there. We hiked on relatively flat land for about 5 miles. It was right beside the Housatonic River. 
I love the sound of rushing water. The river was swift today. There were lots of white caps.  We watched two geese get twisted sideways from the rush. It was rough, and they both took to flight. 
Finally the trail turned away from the river and took us past a couple of fields. There big round hay bales sitting out. They had been covered in white plastic. I’ve never seen this before, but it makes sense to protect it from the elements. 
We had one more UP and there we were at our pickup location. We waited about 10 minutes. Papa Big Swig arrived with two bananas and two bottles of pop!  Yummy!

We came down the other side to find a water crossing waiting for us.  Guinea Brook is most likely a fairly simple crossing any other time of year.  
It’s a wide brook and definitely requires rocks or a barefoot crossing. The problem is that this time of year melting mountain snow has caused Guinea Brook to swell.  Not only swell, but move swiftly.  
I tried the Rocks first with boots on. The water was strong and the rocks were slippery.  I slipped off landing on my feet, but I felt ice cold water spill over the top and into my boots.  
I went back to the bank. We made our way up the bank looking for an easier crossing. The entire bank is a mixture of ice, snow, boulders, and downed trees. Making our way was tricky to say the least. 
At one point the ice gave way to my weight and I found myself falling in.  I reached for a downed tree.  One of my trekking poles went flying, then floating down the brook. Baby girl stopped it with her pole. 
It took me a minute to recover from the fall. I jammed my right ring finger on the tree. It remains sore and swollen to this minute. 
While I was getting myself together, the ice below Baby Girl’s feet caved in.  Down she went.  Ugh!! 
We both ended up sitting on the downed tree. After some contemplation we pulled off our socks and boots.  With our boots slung over a shoulder and our pants rolled up we put our plan in motion.  I went first.  
It was ice cold!  I made it about a 1/4 of the way across before it got too deep. The force of the water was going to be too much for Baby Girl to navigate through. It was too much for me really. 
What to do? 
We put our socks and boots back on and decided to abort the plan. 
We had already made our way pretty far up the bank. It felt unsafe to hike back over cracking ice with water below. So we decided to bushwhack back up the side of the mountain. 
We found ourselves on a major road. Looking at Guthook’s I could see this road crossed over the creek.  I couldn’t tell how far away but we started walking. Along came a truck and it was thumbs up for me and Baby Girl. He pulled over and said we were less than a half mile from our destination so we chose to continue walking.  
A few minutes later we walked right over that brook. We made our way back down to the bank on the other side, and proceeded to bushwhack back down the bank towards the trail.  
Well that didn’t get us very far.  The wet boulders, broken trees, ice, and water became too much.  Soon we were bushwhacking our way up the side of that mountain...and it was steep!  
Much to our liking we found another road up there. It ran parallel to the brook so we followed it. Even more to our liking, we eventually found white blazes!  Yes we made it back!  
By this time we were already exhausted and hungry. Not to mention we were both still cold from the frigid waters. 
Right on the trail was a good sized boulder with warm sun rays shining right on it. That would be our lunch Boulder.  
We took a much needed break. 
After lunch I took a quick look at Guthook’s to check our mileage. We were exactly 4 hours into the hike and had gone exactly 1.7 trail miles. You’ve got to be kidding me!  
Our plan had been to hike the last 13 miles of Connecticut today. There’s no way we would get it done before dark. As soon as I had cell service I notified Papa Big Swig and made a plan B. 
We hiked a lot of UP over the next few miles. The payoff was great! 
Our final descent was a little snowy but not bad. The temperature was perfect with a sunshiny sky.  
After only 6.4 miles we climbed back into the SUV. I can’t help but feel this was somewhat of a wasted day. Now I have to finish up Connecticut tomorrow.  I didn’t even take any pictures today

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608583,"Before 7 o’clock this morning there was a knock at the door. Papa Big Swig had breakfast ready, and the table set for four. A much anticipated guest came through the door...BIG KAHUNA!!!   
I’ve kept it a secret, but he’s hiking the next three days with me!  I couldn’t be happier!  
Myself, Baby Girl, and Big Kahuna hit the trail about 9:30 this morning to finish up Connecticut.  It was not real cold, but it was spitting ice and snow.  
The morning started out going UP. There was a little bit of bouldering which somehow got us off trail briefly. Baby Girl had mentioned she though we should go the other direction, and she was right. 
Around 11:30 we saw a group of rocks about butt high. We took out our sit-upons and sat.  It was a nice little break. We grabbed a snack, and we were good for the rest of the day.  
The rains/ice/snow came and went all day long, but it was still a good day.  The terrain wasn’t bad, and conversation was great!  
Big Kahuna found an abandoned hornets nest today. It was nice to see it up close and let Baby Girl see it.  He also pointed out an old tree stand. Me and Baby Girl would have missed them both. 
Our hike flew by quickly.  It was a fun day! Were predicted to get several inches of snow tonight, but my boots will be back on tomorrow. 
Until Next Time

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608629,"Our boots hit the trail about 8:30 this morning. Just as we began our trek snowflakes started falling. They fell the rest of the day. 
There were a couple of small water crossings, then the trail carved it’s way through a couple of fields. 
We began our first UP. It was a little over 1800 feet elevation. This will be Baby Girls highest climb. 
The climate changed a bit up there. It was colder, more windy, and more snowy. All of that sounds bad, but I loved it!  Winter hiking remains my favorite. 
Big Kahuna and I knew what to expect, but this was a brand new experience for Baby Girl.  She fell once. There were tears but she got herself back up and carried on.  I am so proud of her!  This is not easy! 
We were hiking past a pond known as Knee Deep Pond. It was mostly frozen over, but not completely. 
Big Kahuna noticed a Beaver’s Lodge out there. He ALWAYS sees the cool stuff!  He called me and Baby Girl over to the waters edge to look at it. 
What an experience! The lodge was perfectly constructed, and Beavers were poking their heads up through little holes in the ice. It reminded me of the game Whack-A-Mole!  
We went UP from there and found ourselves in a pine forest.  The snow on the pines was absolutely beautiful!  I enjoyed every step through there.  
Before I knew it we could hear cars whizzing by on the road below.  We came out of the woods and walked down the road to Big Kahuna’s car. 
A GREAT hike occurred today!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608747,"The snow continued through the night. Big Kahuna and I made the executive decision that today would not be a good day for Baby Girl to hike.  We were right.  
 We started our hike going UP Beckett Mountain 2180ft elevation. 
The actual climb on a snow free day would have been easy peasy.  This was NOT our day!  
Slowly but surely the snow got deeper and deeper until we took a step and sunk down to our knees...over and over again...for miles! 
It was fun, but physically exhausting!  My calves were having spasms, my left hip too.  Nonetheless we laughed and enjoyed our snowy adventure. 
There were moments when the sun would poke its head out between clouds. It felt good and made our endless search for blazes a little less chilly.  
Since most blazes were covered by snow and ice we had to use our sixth sense and Guthook’s to navigate the trail. I looked one direction and said this looks “trail-ish”, then Big Kahuna would lead and say that looks “trail-ish”.   And the truth is, not one time did our mountain instincts steer us wrong!  
We weren’t too far past a frozen pond when we heard someone coming up from behind us.  It turned out to be two someone’s and a dog!  They are Trail Runners.  Trail running is a big thing in these mountain areas.  
They run the A.T. On a regular basis and know every twist and turn by heart. This was the jackpot for me and Big Kahuna! We had footprints in the snow to follow!   
Those boys ran about 4 or 5 more miles past us then turned around just before a shelter. They chatted a bit as they passed us again on the return visit. Then  Big Kahuna and I had double footprints to follow!  It was still deep, but nice. 
We followed their tracks, and some bunny prints all the way to October Mountain Shelter. We were both pretty spent.  He took the bottom bunk on one side and I took the other side.  We ate a snack and took a much needed rest.   
Big Kahuna found a blue blaze back to the trail. About a mile later we met a couple of teenage boys with full gear heading to that shelter for an overnight.  They had gotten off trail. It’s so easy to do in the snow. Big Kahuna saved them some grief.  He directed them to our tracks which would take them straight to the shelter. 
It’s nice to be able to give back. 
It felt like no time at all had gone by, when we found ourselves on the road a few yards from where Big Kahuna’s car was waiting.  
I was a little sad. This will be my last A.T. hike with my trail brother.  
We had Big Kahuna’s famous spaghetti for supper, and one last game of Phase 10 before calling it a night.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608792,"The four of us went out for breakfast early this morning. I rode to my start with Big Kahuna. We followed Papa Big Swig and Baby Girl there. 
Everybody patiently waited while I got my hiker gear on. Then it was time to hug Big Kahuna goodbye one last time.  Tears filled my eyes.  Our A.T. days are over.  
The snow was still too deep for Baby Girl, so I started off alone.  I could hear Big Kahuna singing the knapsack song as I hiked away.  
Yes the snow remained a challenge, but at least there was no wind today.  Yesterday we watched little snow devils blow up and spin around off and on all day long.  
I hiked in the deep snow about 3 miles.  I enjoyed the solitude and just got lost in my thoughts.  
I got tearful again thinking about Tammy & Maryann my sisters in law.   I had only been hiking about two weeks in Georgia.  It was during a time when I was questioning my own ability to do this. This particular weekend they showed up at my hostel!  I was soooo happy to see them! We made a Walmart run, and met up with my tramily at a microbrewery.  It was a great day!  
Then I wandered off to my original tramily.  We are still very close. Texas is in the middle of a move near the A.T., Feathers begins her PCT hike in a few days, Daddy Shakira is getting married next month, and Flower Boy will be completing the A.T. with me!!!  
The secret is out!  
He’s driving to Mass from Maine when he gets off work tomorrow.  He will hike Greylock with me and help me finish what we started together. I’m so excited to hike with him again!  
About three miles in I came to a road. The snow was much less deep, and I recognized the area.  Big Kahuna had shown me pictures just this morning at breakfast.  He had recently hiked that section and said Baby Girl would love it.  
I had cell service so I called Papa Big Swig.  Within 30 minutes Baby Girl was there with her boots on!  Seylor Jo came too.  
We started going UP.  This is a popular local site and there were several people with dogs.  We all had to leash up more than usual.  
Up we climbed to the summit of Warner Hill 2050ft elevation. What a view!   Mountains for miles!  
The local folks enjoyed the view and went back down.  Baby Girl and I continued hiking northbound.  The snow did get deeper on the less traveled area, but we managed fine.  
It was a little snowy during our blue blaze to Kay Wood Shelter.  Named after Kay Wood a lifelong volunteer, trail angel, and hiker.  
We enjoyed a snack and some rest before taking the snowy journey back to the trail.   
The DOWNs going into Dalton were icy and steep.  Baby Girl took one on her butt all the way down.  Finally we popped out of the woods, over railroad tracks, and into town.

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608870,"Baby Girl started the day with me. We decided to go SOBO and end this day right back in Dalton. 
Our hike began in a pasture.  In only a few yards we were blessed with our first view of the day. The sun was shining and the breeze was soft. 
We are in for a great day!
The trail took us through some cornfields and down into Cheshire Mass. Cheshire is a small quaint mountain town. We walked through Cheshire to the edge of town and started back UP into the mountains. 
This was our first experience with icy inclines today. Many more would follow.  
We did stop for lunch during this first climb, but it took 2 hours and 30 minutes to reach our summit. What a view! 
The icy descent proved to be too much for Baby Girl.  Down went McGinty for the first time today.  She would have 9 falls before this hike was over.  
Our journey took us past a semi-frozen Lake with a little beavers dam.  Then past a tree with three huge holes that I’m assuming are from woodpeckers. Wood dust and chips were on the ground below. 
We crossed a creek and started up. Just as we came to some power lines there were large deep tire prints in the snow. They went up the Appalacian Trail for about a quarter mile.  Now I’m not complaining because it made for much easier hiking in the snow, but isn’t the trail for foot traffic only? 
The rest of the day was an even mix of UP and DOWN, ice and snow. 
We popped out of the woods to a parking area where Papa Big Swig was waiting.  This will end my A.T. adventure with Baby Girl. I’m so glad she spent some time in the woods me. Wouldn’t trade it for anything!

Blue Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609015,"Last night’s knock on the door was Flower Boy!  I was so happy to see him!  We met each other my first day of hiking the trail. March 28, 2018, and he’s here to hike my last day with me.  Our friendship has come full circle.  
We started our hike going UP. Mount Greylock is 3489ft above sea level.  She will be my last big climb on the A.T.   
The journey up was snowy and long.  We stopped at Mark Noepel Shelter for a snack. Then continued our ascent. 
In places the snow was three feet deep. In others it was only 6 or 7 inches.  It was a heavy wet snow and really made my legs ache during this climb.  I think Flower Boy felt the same.  
Flower Boy is already a thruhiker. He completed his hike in September. He already has photos of this portion of the trail from a different time of year. 
At one point we saw a wooden structure across an open snow covered space.  He said this space is actually water.  Like a pond or a lake.  He has a photo from when he hiked through here before. 
As I began walking towards the structure he snapped a photo of me and said “she walks on water”. It was true, I did walk on water...frozen water! Haha 
After five hours of hiking UP, there it was, the monument on top of Greylock. 
The view was nothing short of breathtaking. I took photos, and did a live Facebook video. I took my time and enjoyed the view.  
Flower Boy and I sat on the concrete around the monument and ate our lunch.  It was windy, but the sun was shining. He gave me a fist bump... it’s the hiker way.  
I left Greylock feeling accomplished.  I thought I might be weepy but I really wasn’t. We went DOWN, then back UP to Mount Williams. There was another view but nothing that compared to Greylock.  
As we made our way to Mount Prospect ledge we were reminiscing. 
Flower Boy has ALWAYS wanted to trail name me “hammer” because I’m the only hiker who ever started out with a hammer in their pack!  In my defense it was a small hammer! 
But as we were hiking he said Hammer was still appropriate because I am tough as nails. He was impressed that I had hiked through this much snow!  Not just now, but in November and December too. He’s from Maine and said if it hadn’t been for me, he would NEVER be out in this!  
The ledge was nice, but still nothing compared to Greylock. Greylock was MY personal grand finale!  
We had nice Mountain View’s the whole way down. Towards the end I could hear music calling us out to the road.  It was Baby Girl and Papa Big Swig blaring The Climb by Miley Cyrus...it’s my song!  They had flowers, hugs & kisses, and my daughters on FaceTime with grandkids in the background. I may have lost it a little at that moment. 
Soon my phone rang and it was my trail sister Hugs.  I got texts from Big Kahuna, Texas, Daddy Shakira, and Feathers. 
It was a good day! 
I thought I would come out of the wilderness with all of this new and profound wisdom to share with the world.  Nope.  
I do have a much better sense of  self than I’ve ever had before.  AND, I think this new sense of self is in all the right ways. You know, the securely grounded but reaching for the stars way.  
The very best part of my journey was the people. I was blessed with the right people at the right times on trail.  From Tramily to other hikers I met in passing, to trail angels, volunteers, and of course my own family and friends. 
People showed up when I needed them. They showed up with a good heart and kind words.  
All of my tramily members will be tramily for life. I genuinely love them all! 
Most importantly I would be lost without my biggest fan, the love of my life, Papa Big Swig!  
I am so grateful to have had this opportunity.  I am blessed undeservedly blessed. 
Now I’ve got a book to write.
