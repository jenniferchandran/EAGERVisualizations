Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585234,"After having to take off all of 2017 for medical reason, I am eager to get started once again in 2018.  
 

For those of you who followed me in prior years, you may recall that I had to get off the AT in Maryland in late October 2016.  After obtaining immediate Emergency Room care in a Hagerstown hospital for a serious bladder infection, I returned home to Aiken, SC.    A few weeks later I was scheduled for Prostate surgery (TURP) as a cure for the problem.  That went fine and I was recovering at home about a week later when I started having back pains.  That turned out to be a pulmonary embolism, most likely the result of the surgery.  That put me on a precautionary strong blood thinner for a 6-month protocol.  That precluded a 2017 spring hike due to the danger of any bleeding while in the woods.  Unfortunately while being treated for the PE, they discovered via X-rays that I also had an Ascending Aortic Aneurism (a bulge in the aorta just above the heart).  At first it was a watch and see situation to determine if it was stable (could have been there my whole life).  About April of 2017 I came off the precautionary blood thinner regimen and tests showed the aneurism had not changed.  So, I was cleared by the doctors to engage in any physical activities that I wanted, including long distance hiking.

 

So, plans were made for a fall 2017 AT hike and serious physical training ensued. All plans were made, travel arrangements to Harpers Ferry done and backpack packed and ready to go.  Then I noticed some slight pains in my back and doctors thought it would be prudent before hiking to check it out.  A CAT scan revealed that the aneurism had grown and surgery was planned.  I was so downhearted after training so heavily and being so close to going.  On 10/18/17 I had open-heart surgery to replace a section of the aortic artery and also a replacement aortic valve installation.   Surgery went fine; actually surprisingly pain free throughout the entire recovery process.  For 3 months my only allowed exercise was walking, and I did a ton of that around neighborhood streets and a local mall when raining/freezing.  In June I was told I could start exercising more and that a spring hike was certainly possible. Been training and planning ever since.  I am now ready to go; although it was a tough job getting strength back after serious surgery.

 

The picture is what I looked like on Halloween of last year – come a long way since then.  At that time I was considering going trick or treating in my hard won costume.",,View Entry,"Mar 29, Thu",0
Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585535,"So, the days are getting closer to my April 14th start out of Harpers Ferry.  Actually will be leaving home in less than a week from now.   Driving up to Charlotte, NC next Saturday for an early morning Sunday flight to Denver.  Will pick up my daughters car at the Denver airport and drive it to her new home in Charlottesville VA.  On 4/10 we will converge on Charlottesville via 3 separate paths.  Daughter and family will have departed CO on 4/6 after their old home closing, Wendy will arrive driving from Aiken, SC (with my hiking gear) and I will be completing my 1600-mile drive from Denver.  Wow, 1600 miles in 3 days, shortly to be followed by a planned 572 miles in about 2 months.  Will spend a couple of days in VA with the family and see their new home, then depart from there on AMTRAK early on the 13th to arrive in Harpers Ferry later that afternoon.

 

Just recently it seemed I had plenty of time to complete my pre-hike to-do list.  Now, suddenly, it is tight.  Will have a busy week this week.  Am planning on 3 additional 8 to 10 mile outings with my full pack in nearby woods.  Physically, I feel that I am ready; but a little more training will not hurt.  And will also do two more Body Combat classes at the gym.

 

This section hike on paper does not seem as demanding as previous sections.  Just as a quick and dirty way of looking at it, I looked up the maximum AT elevation within each state.  States I have completed are: GA, NC, TN, VA ad WV.  Their maximum elevations are: 4457, 5435, 6667, 5447 & 1117 feet. This planned section hike covering MD, PA, NJ, NY, CT and Mass are: 1795, 2070, 1701, 1433, 2316 & 3491.  This is a noticeable difference.  Obviously there will still be climbs; but not as many and not as severe over-all.  What is concerning is the reputation of PA as being very rocky as well as portions of NY.  I do not like hiking on rocks; but so be it.",,View Entry,"Apr 02, Mon",0
Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585584,"After this entry my 2018 journals will start appearing for everyone to see.  Probably my last entry until 4/13 when I arrive in Harpers Ferry.  At that point I will meet up with my old hiking pal, Trudger.  We have hiked together a couple of times after meeting on the AT in GA back in March, 2014.  After spending the night in a hostel, we’ll start out the next day.  Trudger is planning to go to Duncannon, PA with me, about 2 weeks of hiking. Then he’ll depart to prepare for his trip back to Peru.

 

Did a 9 mile hike with full pack this morning in nearby Hitchcock Woods.  Plan on 2 more such training efforts before departing.  Hope I do not lose too much off my training by having over a week elapse before I hit the trail.  Five of those days will be sitting in a plane, a 3 day drive and a day on AMTRAK.

 

Been reading lots of other hikers Trail Journals.  They have had horrible weather this so far this year.  Hope Mother Nature has decided that enough is enough. I do not want hot or even warm.  Looking for cold/cool nights and cool days for awhile.

A good first day.  Trudger and I left the hostel in Harpers Ferry at 7:30am.  We hiked together all day.We had planned on stopping for the day at the first shelter at 7.1 miles.  Even after a 900 foot climb we made it there at noon.  We decided to go on after lunch and ended up just short of the 2nd shelter.  We are stealth camping with no one else around.  Just about .5 miles back was a War Correspondents Memorial (picture) where we had dinner at picnic tables in a pavilion.
It was hot today, in the lower 80's.  Making me a hot, sweaty, stinking hiker.  In fact lying in my tent writing this in just my boxers(tmi?).  Suppose to be much cooler tomorrow; however, rain is coming.  Potential heavy rains Sunday and Monday make us uncertain of plans for tomorrow. 
It was a big first day and we're both quite tired.  Saw many other hikers today.  Probably nearing a hundred or more. Were high school groups, college groups, Boy Scout groups, section hikers and thru hikers.  In the hostel were 2 thru hikers that are already this far after starting in GA in February.","Harpers Ferry

A note to my friends(former co-workers) at BAE who enjoy such talk....by stealth camping last night there was no privy.  So I had to pull off a PITW to avoid a PIMP this morning.
Trudger and I met up with a nice retired guy trail named Rock Dawg from Savanah, GA early today and we all hiked together.  It was a short day for us, only 5.1 miles.  We arrived at a very nice, newer shelter and made a decision to stay there.  Very heavy rains were forecast for the evening.  Our thinking was even if we went to the next shelter it was only rated to hold 5 people.  So what if we got there and had to tent in heavy rain?
At the shelter where we stayed there were 9 of us.  A girl and 2 young guys, an older couple and 4 old farts.  And there was room to spare.
It did in fact rain.  As best as I could tell with intermittent sleeping it rained hard from about 9pm until 6am with temps in the low 40's.
Another bummer was that when I got up in the morning I found my phone battery was dead.  Thus the delay in posting journals and lack of pictures.
It was a long, boring day sitting and laying around in a cold shelter from about 10am to the next morning.","Stealth camp

Trudger, Rock Dawg and I got a late start today due to the rain and cold.  There was a forecast of another band of showers coming so we had on our rain gear and pack covers.
During the day I passed the point I got off the trail in October, 2016 due to medical problems.  So, on to virgin territory for me.
The trail was very wet, flooded sections from the overnight rains.  We never did get much rain during the day; but, a few light snow/ice pellets.  Even though it didn't rain we were plenty wet from sweating under rain gear and shoes/socks soaked from unavoidable puddles.
After 7.5 miles we arrived at the shelter and secured our spots in the older, small shelter.  A south bounder told us he was there during the torrential previous nights rains and the roof leaked.  Sure enough there were some wet spots on the floor.
So another short day due to weather and surprisingly plethora of darn rocks.  Thought PA was suppose to be the rocky state, not Maryland.","Rocky Run Shelter

Again hiking with Trudger and Rock Dawg.  It was a long, cold and windy day.  In the 40's and VERY rocky.  We planned on a bigger mileage day to set up a morning arrival into Waynesboro, PA the next day.
In the afternoon we met some south bounders who told us of two upcoming streams that were heavily swollen from the recent heavy rains...and too dangerous to ford.  They were normally just crossable via stone stepping.  We got some tips from them about detours.  Sure enough they were too dangerous to cross.  The first involved bushwhacking about .2 miles to where a road bridge crossed the stream and back tracking on the road to the AT again.  The second detour was more involved.  Had to bushwhack along the steam about .3 miles to small walking bridge (actually where the AT once crossed the stream before a trail re-route years ago).  Then up a steep bank to a road and down the road to rejoin the current AT trail again
Then near the end of the day we had a large rocky ascent that plum wore me out.  And on top of that, had a .8 mile round trip on a steep trail to resupply water for the night and next morning.
So, a very tiring day.  Officially 13.1 trail miles.  But with the detours and long trip to the spring it was about 15 miles in total.
Slept in the shelter again with about 7 others.  Another newer, 2 tiered shelter.  Again in the low 30's overnight.","Pine Knob Shelter

Another short day as planned to go into Waynesboro. PA.  It is about 3 miles from the AT.  But it worked out well because Trudger and I benefitted from Rock Dawg having his truck parked at Pen Mar Park.  It is a Maryland state park right at the state line and the AT goes right through it.  So we all rode into town to a Days Inn.
Trudger decided a few days earlier that he was not enjoying this hike and arranged for his son to drive down from NY and pick him up that afternoon.
Rock Dawg and I shared a room, went to a laundromat and to Pappy's Pub for dinner.  
Sometime along the day, I also decided that this hike was not what I wanted to continue as well.  More on that on my next post.","Raven Rock Shelter

Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587382,"FINAL, yes FINAL(Due to a dead phone battery, am posting several days at once, please go back to see them).
It's really over this time.  
I am currently on AMTRAK in North Carolina somewhere - on the way to  Columbia, SC.  Should arrive there about 1:40am Friday.  Wendy will pick me up about 5:30am.  Earlier today got a ride from an AT shuttler from Waynesboro back to Harpers Ferry.  Picture is the beginning of the rail trip over the river bridge and through the tunnel and towards home.
I finally concur with Trudger's comment ""thinking about hiking the AT is much better than actually doing it"".  
I've known for some time that the likelihood I'd ever complete the whole 2,190 mile AT was a real long shot.  The last week really drove that home.  The realization of the more frequent occurrences of real rocky areas as I would go forward is very disheartening to me.  Especially the larger rocks that you just don't step over; but, have to step up onto(or worse) are killers for me.  Could not see going on, not enjoying the hiking, when I had given up the dream of ever finishing.
I am proud of completing almost half of the AT.  Have met so many really nice people, enjoyed friendships with several and will have lifelong memories.
Do not feel last years heart surgery had anything to do with this decision.  I felt good out there physically and am happy with my recovery from it.
Want to thank all the family, friends and total strangers that supported me from 2014 until now.  Of course, especially Wendy who so often supported me and endured being home alone so many times.
Time to move on to something else.  More travel with Wendy, taking up golf again, or whatever.  I may go on short hikes with family and/or friends.  But no more long distance backpacking trips.  Could even do short sections of the AT I enjoyed or would like to do.

My plan is to hike northward on the AT thru the entire length of the park (103 miles) to near Front Royal, VA plus another 15 miles north.  Then will turnaround and hike south back to Waynesboro.  Thinking this will take about 21 days allowing me to be back home before Halloween.",,View Entry,"Oct 02, Tue",0
Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603958,"Hike start is only 3 days away.  Am I ready?  The frequent pre-hike question.  Pretty sure I am.....it’s not my first rodeo.
I’ve trained quite hard for a couple of months(except for some trips with Wendy).  For example since early June I’ve logged 280 walking miles in nearby Hitchcock Woods’s. Unfortunately only the most recent 40 of those miles were while wearing a backpack.  If you’re familiar with SC heat & humidity (overnight lows in the 70’s with early mornings at or near 100% humidity) you understand why.  Still in the last 2.5 months I’ve lost 25 pounds via exercise and improved eating habits.  Now I am ready to “pig/out” while hiking without any concerns.  Over the course of all my hikes since 2014 I average nearly half a pound of weight loss per day!!!  Does that fact encourage anyone to come along with me?
Earlier today made final decisions about what goes in my backpack(see-pic).  As usual it is a few pounds heavier(37 pounds) than what I had hoped.  I’m basically a “better safe than sorry” kind of guy that finds it hard to not take along many items.  Also since I’ll be in potentially cold weather, have to take appropriate gear, clothes, gloves, etc.  Also bringing along my stove/fuel canister for hot meals on those cool nights after a hard day of hiking.

Pic today is grandkids seeing me off at the trailhead - Jack and Kate.
A fairly short day; but, sure was tiring.  But made it to tonight’s shelter at about 3:20 (9am start). Saw about 20 other hikers today - about 6 of which were southern bound thru/hikers.  Temps were higher than I would like(in a the 70’s and humid).
Tomorrow’s planned mileage is 15 miles to the next shelter. Do not know if that is feasible?  Will be starting out earlier than today; but almost twice as many miles?  We’ll see how it goes!
About a dozen people here tonight.  Most like me are either in tents or hammocks.  All except one is on just 2 or 3 day hikes.  The other longer distance hiker is Amy from Kentucky.  We’ll probably be seeing each other most nights for awhile.
It is a 2 Aleeve night to ease those hard worked muscles and hopefully assure a restful sleep.

Pic today is an early morning view.
A very difficult day on the AT.  Most significant factor was the weather.  This afternoon was in the mid 80’s and humid.  October climate data indicates that October highs in this area s/b 67 for a high and 41 for lows. Quite a bit above expectations.  A pertinent quote from Mark Twain “Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get”.
The day start out well.  I was first of the north bounders out of camp at 7am. Amy was about 15 minutes later.  We met up with a husband/wife a little while later trail named Peanut Butter & Jelly. They all passed me in the morning and I did not see them again.  As a heavy sweater I was more impacted by the heat & humidity.   By afternoon I was really struggling.  With 4 miles to go to the planned shelter I knew I did not have enough water to make it.  As I approached a trail head parking area, I tried “yogiing” water from day hikers.  First asked 2 guys just getting back from a day hike and they gave me all they had, about half a bottle.  Little while later a couple came over with a gallon jug and filled both my bottles completely Excellent trail magic.  That gave me renewed hope of hiking another 3.7 miles to the shelter.  However shortly later I started getting leg cramps and decided to stop and stealth camp for the night.
So now I’m behind schedule.  See if I can pick it up tomorrow.  High temp tomorrow should be about 10 degrees cooler.

Not as bad as yesterday; but, still a trying day.  During last evening I had a fair amount of leg and hand cramping as I tried to do things and/or change positions.  As of morning that had largely disappeared.  
Started hiking in the dark at 6:45.  Made it to the shelter I had planned on for Sunday about 10:30 this morning.  Again I was aided by trail angels in a trail head parking lot who filled both of my water bottles. At the shelter Iater, drank plenty of water and took a nap.  Before that I was really struggling with a long uphill, feeling drained often taking about 50 steps and resting repeatedly. Afterwards on a similar long uphill I did better; but, not up to usual standards.  Guess it’s taking a little time to recover from Saturday’s heat, humidity and dehydration.
Stopped at 3:30 this afternoon.  Maybe could have gone further but decided to not push too hard until feeling 100% again.  Tenting in a primative campsite offered by the SNP.  It offers picnic tables, water and restrooms.  Am the only one here.  Did see lots of people today.  Probably tapering off tomorrow as the holiday weekend has ended.

Was quite wet this morning.  Not from rain - high humidity/foggy conditions.  Had a little trouble finding my hanging bear bag of food even tho it has reflective markings.  It was just turning light as I started out.
Most of today’s hiking was level or slightly downhill with a smooth path.  However, the few, relatively short uphills were killing me.  Like previous day quite often were short number of steps and then leaning on my hiking poles to rest.  Very slow and frustrating.
Finally reached Loft Mountain Wayside at about 2:30.  Had a burger, fries and chocolate shake.  Tasted good; but, surprised that I had trouble finishing it and did not want more. Those of you who know me would expect I’d wolf down much more.
Had called my daughter earlier in the day and asked for a bailout ride back to her house, about an hour away.  By dinner time was back at her home near Charlottesville, VA.
So, this hike is over.  Will have one more post to wrap up thoughts.","

Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604337,"Looking back on this hike, I feel like I may have narrowly avoided potential disaster.  I think that last Sunday I may have been very close to heat exhaustion, or worse.  Probably took chances I should not have.  Even now several days later I am still working on getting back to feeling normal.  
I drove home yesterday in time to help Wendy stowaway outdoor furniture,etc before the remnants of hurricane Michael went right over us last night and this morning.  Got some rain and wind; but, only minor limbs down from trees.
For my ardent supporters, you know at the conclusion of previous hikes I’ve made comments that my long distance hiking days were over.  I’ve received some good kidding about that...and deservingly so.  But here I go again.  My long distance hikes are over.  If anyone hears me talk about changing my mind, get a lead pipe and break my leg....please.
I am very glad that I got started hiking the AT back in 2014.  Over the years I’ve logged 1,112 AT miles.  Even did about 70 of those miles after 2017 open heart surgery.  But now is the time to depart the AT and find other age appropriate hobbies.
My wife, Wendy, has been so accommodating and supportive in so many ways.  And this year daughter, Tracey and husband, Jason have been helpful after moving to VA.  And oh so many friends I’ve met on the trail - hikers and trail angels.  Most notable hiking friends Jeff(aka Paul Bunion) and Trudger.  And of course so many friends and relatives who’ve followed on Trail Journals.  THANK YOU ALL.

P.S.  After lunch Wendy & I went out to pick up fallen limbs, pine cones and such in our yard.  After about 90 minutes of relatively light yard work, I feel wiped out.  Guess my recovery lingers on.","
