String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580887,"Hi friends and family!
Thanks for taking the time to read up on what Josh and I are doing to get our mind, body, and gear ready for our AT attempt this summer. We are incredibly excited (obviously) and it's full steam ahead right now.
This past Monday was Josh's 1st day back on the job at a local ski area after his year and half away from Durango. I am in London visiting family but will be returning promptly to secure my winter employment. Josh is required to work until the end of May so we will starting as soon as he finishes up on the mountain. In addition to working our hineys off this winter, we will be living at my mom's house rent-free (THANK YOU Mama Mac!), getting our gear dialed in, and spending many hours in the gym and in the mountains so that we are in tip top shape come April. More on that in future posts. 
What we are focused on right now is reuniting after 3+ months apart to start making some decisions about how we want to move forward in our AT prep.",,View Entry,"Nov 30, Thu",0
String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581274,"Josh and I are pretty fortunate to have had extensive opportunities to backpack throughout our lives. One thing that this means for us is that we have a lot of gear/ clothing already that we have used and loved. The saying we would to describe this is that, ”our systems are pretty dialed”. The amount of gear planning for us will be minimal compared to some people who have to start from scratch. Yet this does not mean we have none to do! So far out from our tentative start date in early April, there is little more we can do than gear plan. 
 

Our biggest question we have asked ourselves has been to 2-person quilt or not to 2-person quilt. We love the idea of quilts (even though neither of us have used them much) AND we love snuggling. The price tags are super steep but I am totally down to make one. Will the thruhiker stench be too much though? Will I want my own stink bubble? Are we risking losing flexibility within our systems if one of us needs to get off the trail unexpectedly? The people I reached out to gave me mixed reactions at best about 2-person quilts. Someone recommended Enlightened Equipment’s Convert but at $330 a bag it’s a no-no for us.

 

I took advantage of a deal on a Marmot Angel Fire sleeping bag this summer. Josh and I ran upstairs to see if it would zip well with his Big Agnes bag. SUCCESS! With our respective, inflatable sleeping pads (NeoAir & Big Agnes), sleeping bags (Big Agnes & Marmot), and tent (Nemo Hornet 2P) already in our possession, we are very well on our way. I’m hoping to get our gear list posted on here in the future closer to our start date 
 

We lay on the floor for about 10 minutes in our zipped up sleeping bags discussing gear challenge numero dos: our backpacks. While we own waayyyy too many backpacks, this may be the one ultralight item we really invest in.  Lots of great options out there to choose from J

 

Will let you know when we have more!",,View Entry,"Dec 13, Wed",0
String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581272,"There is a full, separate story on how my trail name came to be. It is relevant to this topic because, in a way, it is describes me physically: I am white and I am stringy. According to Google, synonyms to stringy are:

 

(of a person) tall, wiry, and thin.

   synonyms:
 lanky, gangling, gangly, rangy, wiry, bony, skinny, scrawny, thin, spare, gaunt
 
 

I’ve always been like this; I’m built like my dad. 
 

When I hiked the PCT and other times of high activity, my small frame was a problem. While the number of pounds I lost was not astonishingly high, the percentage was noteworthy. At 5’7”, I finished the trail around 105 lbs –  underweight! I didn’t menstruate during my thruhike since I quickly depleted my fats and, near Tahoe, I became so small that my hipbelt didn’t sit on me anymore. I had to hike in my sports bra so that I could use my hiking shirt and baselayer to pad my hip belt enough to stay up.

 

Needless to say, I don’t want that to happen again!!!

 

Eating better on the trail is going to be extremely crucial to prevent this from reoccurring. But what can I do now? Start with a more stout foundation! Gain weight! That’s the plan at least J I will use this journal as a bit of an accountability practice. Through healthy diet and exercise, I hope to gain 10 pounds or more in the next 3 ½ months.",,View Entry,"Dec 18, Mon",0
String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581276,"As I am getting settled into Durango at my mom's place with Josh, it is time to take my fitness seriously again. Josh loves the gym. He is knowledgable about all the equipment, can come up with routines on the fly, and is also incredibly strong and buff for his smaller frame; all things that I am not! He has gotten us a punch pass at the local recreation center, we have acquired their pool and exercise class schedules and we are ready to make the most of this winter. The scale in the ladies changing room read 112.5 lbs on my first gym visit. So far, we've been to the gym twice this week. We have done only arms and chest exercises followed up with abs. Josh is a terrific gym partner and has been especially helpful in choosing and determining the correct weight I should be attempt as I try these new strength-based exercises. Once we finalize our work schedules, we will set our workout slots for the rest of our time here. Any and all encouragement are much appreciated at this point as I suffer through the beginning of many sore days!",,View Entry,"Dec 19, Tue",0
String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582329,"Life has been good. We have both had mini successes and are slowly taking steps to be ready for our upcoming thruhike. 
Work: While the snow is non-existent here in southwest Colorado, Josh is a salaried employee and has been making the most of the unfortunate situation. As we wait for Ullr to drop some snow on us, his employer has been giving him diverse, short-term tasks to keep him plenty busy. 
I have been putting 60 hours a week in at my two jobs. My primary job is working as a barista at an artisanal chocolate shop - I love it there. My secondary is working as a budtender at a local dispensary. When snow comes, I'll add ski instructor to my resume at a local hill. I am almost singularly focused on making enough money for this thruhike and I feel these are going to be good seasonal positions for me to reach that goal by April!
Fitness: We have purchased a 3-month pass at the local recreation center and have been utilizing it thoroughly. Since it's just in the last week that I received my regular schedule regarding shifts, we have yet to establish our workout routines but it's coming soon. Even so, I'm growing already in mass and knowledge. Josh has taught me well and I feel comfortable working in the weight room without him now. Last time I checked the scale, I also hit 116lbs! Unlimited access to chocolate is definitely helping :)
Gear: On this front, there is less to report on. Josh was told he will be receiving his requested down puffy as a holiday present. My family pooled together to get me a Wekey 2 foldable, ultralight keyboard. Pretty sure we will both go for Osprey Exos packs since they are local and economic. I have also been following Backcountry Banter- it's a site written by my friend and Triple Crowner, Apache. I expect we will get some of his gear recommendations too for things like trekking poles, etc. our AWOL guide should be shipping out this month too.
All smiles on our end!",,View Entry,"Jan 10, Wed",0

I want to first give Vicki a major shoutout for her support- it felt so incredibly good to read it. Secondly, I want to invite any and all of you to follow suit and let us know you will be with us along our journey too. While I have many reasons to motivate my continued writing, there is definitely some sort of additional incentive when I know there are people even slightly invested in this thruhike too.

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583054,"For my birthday weekend, Josh took me over to nearby Ouray to watch some amazing climbers at the Ouray Ice Climbing Festival AND THEN get our soak on at my absolute favorite private hot springs, Orris!! (He knows me so well!)
One of my favorite things about the Fest is checking out all of the gear tents! Not only do I get to stock up on some sweet swag and stickers, we get to see the latest innovations coming up and we were blown away but some of the ultralight gear that is starting to hit the market. Obviously, few things are transferable between ice climbing and thru-hiking but we found the backpack that we both want to use this summer at the Osprey tent. Osprey is going to be introducing an ultralight backpack (under 2lbs.) this Spring; the models are the Levity (M) and the Lumina (W) for $250! Upon returning to town, we went to the local pro-gear shop and have special ordered ours. The packs will be coming out mid/late-March so we will hopefully snatch it up just in time.
Lots of stoke right now!",,View Entry,"Jan 22, Mon",0
String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583052,"3 years ago I head about thru-hiking and it instantly sparked my interest. Ever since I was young I loved the outdoors and running, and thru-hiking seemed like an amazing blend of physicality and appreciation of nature. It was only a matter of time until I embarked on a thru-hike attempt and the opportunity arose for the summer of 2018, so I jumped on it like a cat to a ball of yarn. I am so excited to spend months in nature, push my body through trials and tribulations, meet the thru-hiking community I have heard so much about, and most of all experience and learn from the unexpectedness the trail throws at you. This summer will be hard, beautiful, exhausting, educational, and one of the best of my life. I can’t wait to hike the AT and write a different paragraph of why I hiked the AT, wherever I finish.",,View Entry,"Feb 05, Mon",0
String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583055,"After the Ouray Ice Fest, I came down with a pretty gnarly cold -> sinus infection that took me out. Got my first days off from work in awhile but that is not how I would've liked to spend it. As I was finally starting to crawl out from my boogery darkness, Josh came down with the flu (not from me, from his other girlfriends :P haha). The sickness and the caring-for-each-other really took our momentum at the gym. 
Josh has bounced back well. He's now training for a 30k race he and a friend are doing together in Moab towards the end of March. My 60-70 work weeks are starting to catch to me. Plus, working at a chocolate shop heading into Valentine's Day meant many more hours and honestly, some stress. 
All hope is not lost though! The unreliable scale my mom has here says I'm at 113lbs. Also, we finally got a dumping of snow we so desperately. I was fortunate enough to start work at 4pm so I got to finally get my skis on and shred the deepest pow we have had yet. While I rarely made it an entire run without having to give my quads a break in ungroomed powder, I thought I was actually in pretty good skiing shape for my first day out.",,View Entry,"Feb 17, Sat",0

I will get a couple of days with my best friend who I haven't seen since he visited me in Alaska. (He is about to finish his Masters at Ole Miss- GO FRANCIS!) We will take a road trip to Atlanta where we will pick up Josh who will be flying in from Phoenix after a couple of days with his family. The next day, Francis will leave us at Amicalola State Park for us to start our long walk :) :) :)I'm glad I was transparent with my bosses about the thru hike when I was job hunting. I have no negative feelings about leaving in a month even though my bosses at both jobs joke about me staying on for the summer. With the recent snow, Josh has stepped out of the office and finally gets to run the local ski hill like he was hired to do. We are down to our last 46 days of the normal life.",,View Entry,"Feb 18, Sun",0
String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583738,"My dad says I'm not lucky; I work hard and deserve the good fortune that comes my way. In this case though, I feel lucky. Lucky to have parents that love Josh and I unconditionally and willing to travel to all corners of the planet to be with us and share in our experiences. For the last five years, our parents have been forced to walk big mile days, climb to over 14,000ft, face freezing temperatures and hot jungle climates, and travel remote backcountry roads and trail to find us. This year they requested Club Med. This year, Club Med ain't happening yet they are still so excited! 
We have done some very rough/flexible planning in regards to our parents coming to slack pack and hike with us. That took some time for sure yet we are all so glad to have that arranged now. Josh parents and my dad (Big Mac) will be coming for a week around Trail Days in Damascus, VA in May. As long as we are in the vicinity, they can grab us with a rental car. While they are flexible and it is impossible to set anything in stone, the hope is to have them join us for the Grayson Highlands State Park and maybe see some wild mini ponies! My mom will be coming to slack pack us a little farther north.
Their visits will be a good motivational source for us when we are tired and our feet hurt. Looking forward to it and feeling grateful.",,View Entry,"Mar 03, Sat",0
String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583737,"A month from today, Josh and I will be camping in Amicalola State Park about to start the next big adventure. Just writing that feels shocking!
I have seen a transformation take place with us during this last week particularly. The excitement level has steadily grown. Josh is starting to obsess over gear (particularly our backpack choice) and we have both decided to read ""A Walk in the Woods"". We spent some time laying out our equipment and clothes on the floor to evaluate what we have and to see what we still need to get. This afternoon, we will bring our respective piles to the local pro gear shop to try out some new ultralight packs they just got in. Most importantly, we have hit our financial goals needed to make this summer happen! Anything more we make will help us get from Katahdin to our next landing spot (maybe grad school abroad?!). 
Some fears have also started to creep in. Josh has been struggling with some mysterious knee pain. He was planning to run a 30K right before he flew to Atlanta but has called that off so as not to stress the joint out before our long walk. I seem to have plateaued with my weight gain regardless of how much atresanal chocolate, baked goods, and protein powder I consume. All I can do is vow to indulge more in trail towns and really hope I do not get down to 100lbs like I did on the PCT.   
These last few weeks will be bittersweet. The sweet part is that we are ready to bail employment-wise. Josh's ski hill has closed already due to lack of snow; today is his first day back in the office doing accounting. The chocolate shop has become stressful to say the least while the weed shop is still super chill (surprising, no?). Stepping away from those positions in a couple weeks won't be hard. The bitter part will be leaving our friends and comfortable life. Considering that we have been on the road for almost the last two years, there is a novelty with this 'normal' life. Knowing where we will sleep each night, socializing with people other than ourselves, and having access to clean drinking water, hot showers, a refrigerator, multiple changes of clothes and more, it has been fun and nice and easy. My guess is that we are both feeling recharged but it will be really hard to say goodbye to the community of people we have around us here. 
I also want to say thank you for reading this. It means a lot to us to know there are people like you following along on this journey with us.",,View Entry,"Mar 07, Wed",0
String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585133,"The backpacks we had planned on getting did not pan out. :( 
We were stoked for the Levity/Lumina packs to hit stores this March. After getting notified by the local pro gear shop that they were in, we were prepared to walk home that day with our new (matching) backpacks. Unfortunately, they did not fit!!! The shop employee was super helpful grabbing Small and Medium packs in a variety of brands. The Medium Lumina fit the best but I had the hip belt virtually maxed out; I could only squeeze out another 1/2"" on each side. Josh had some more play in the hip belt but not much.
On the PCT, I hiked for two weeks through the High Sierra shirtless because I needed to use it to pad my Gregory J53 Medium hip belt to keep it on. I was lucky to have my Dad visit me there because we were able to drive around Tahoe looking for someone with an industrial sewing machine to alter the hip belt. I DO NOT want that to happen again. 
Back to the drawing board. Josh, the Excel wizard, made a great spreadsheet with ~10 frequently used packs breaking them down by their features. What was most important for us that the Levity/Lumina lacked was: (1) that we could get a Small hip belt with a Medium framed pack and (2) there were hip belt pockets. Days of reading and watching youtube videos review of our top packs ensued. Ultimately, I think we are really happy with what we each have chosen.
Josh went for the Gossamer Gear Mariposa 60L! He is a fan of the different side pockets on the Mariposa as well as the removable back foam pad to use as a sit pad. I went for an orange ULA Circuit 60L. I have trustworthy friends who love their Circuits plus I really appreciate the elastic H20 bottle holders on the shoulder straps and the double webbing hip belt to dial in the perfect fit.
While we definitely could have gone down a size (volume), we like that we can fit a bear canister in these for future trips as well as room for extra food when we have people hike with us.",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Sun",0
String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585215,"With the big decisions made, it is just the final details we have left to suss out. Some of those include:
Josh has decided to go with a long handled spork. I found an MP3 player that Big Mac loaded up with audio books for my PCT hike. A new batch of audiobooks have been rented from the library and are on being loaded onto Josh's laptop to put on our electronics. Which nail clippers do we take? Bandana or Buff? Setting aside gear for Josh's mom to use when she comes backpacking with us. I'll take the rain pants for beginning and our family can bring the rain skirt when they join us mid-May. 
Starting the crucial conversations: how to deal with our potential hangry fights over sharing food; how to politely propose that we sleep in our separate sleeping bags due to stinkiness; what situations are appropriate to hike separately during the day; more shelters or more stealth camping; what is the total duration are we aiming for; what if someone wants or needs to stop this journey... Some of these are big topics and the answers to them will probably shift as we start this big undertaking. It is still beneficial to address these possible scenarios now while we are well-fed, well-rested, and not trail-weary.
Needless to say, the AT is always on our minds now. We stay up late talking in the darkness about the most random things. We joke about what Josh's trail name will be. We cannot hang out with friends without bringing it up at least once. Even with the little details still to do, CAN WE JUST START ALREADY?!",,View Entry,"Mar 20, Tue",0

It feels that so much needs to be done and so many people need to given their final goodbyes (as we do not plan on returning to Durango). Today I work a double from 6AM to 11PM which includes my last shift at the pot shop. Tomorrow is my last shift at the artisanal chocolate shop. Then there are friends from out of town visiting, getting my last ski turns in, hosting a going-away BBQ, traveling to Santa Fe for an early Tuesday flight and all while being on my moon. Where did all the time go because it feels like I have none left? 
I think this pre-trail anxiety is normal. The excitement is too much to handle. I scour the AT Class of 2018 Facebook page often and am incredibly eager and even envious at times of the hikers already going after it. It still calms my nerves.

The biggest surprise today has been the arrival of Big Mac in Atlanta to help send us off in style tomorrow at Amicalola. So grateful! We are in an amazing room at the Barefoot Hill Lodge. Our last meal was sesame crusted salmon with green beans and quinoa with beer. We laid out all the gear and food. Would be surprised if our packs I have a base weight of over 15 pounds.

After our final showers and a great continental breakfast at Barefoot Hills, Big Mac drove us to Amicalola State Park where we got an awesome rundown (tips and tricks) by Ridgerunner Master Splinter. There were about 12 thruhikers listening in with us and most people had packs that looked medium to large in size.
We signed in and got our hiker numbers: I am 1949; Josh got 1950! They said they have 4000 hikers registered online so far, crazy!! They have a scale out front and our base weights are 14 and 15lbs respectively.  :) hooray!! I was hoping it would be a little lighter but I am still satisfied since I do have a paperback in there that will hopefully be finished shortly. With food and water, we were going to hit the trail with just over 20lbs. 
Big Mac was great and helped us slackpack the 8.8 mikes to Springer. He met us at the top f the falls and again at the summit where we took our food for the next three days from him. 
After a tearful goodbye at the top, Josh and I busted out the last couple miles to Stover Creek Shelter. There were about 10 tents set up in the vicinity and only 1 person in the shelter so we joined her.
Our first experience in shelter culture was good. There was a lot of socializing and laughs amongst all the new hikers. They were from all over the country and two foreigners too. Kids, retirees, vets, single people, couples, and friends.
So far so good. We are feeling really confident right now. I do notice a difference between us and the other new thruhikers. I think a lot of people have room to minimize their pack weights mainly. While it is tempting to guess who might drop out, it's impossible. This first section or two is going to be a steeeep, learning curve for many.

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586387,"Woke up feeling fresh! Since we are going for low mileage days in the beginning, we took our time getting up and out. We were the last thruhikers to leave the shelter.
Encountered our first people deciding to drop out. They were going to hike the three miles back towards Springer to hitch out. It broke my heart. They needed a shakedown. Even with the most beautiful cubren fiber tarp tent and backpack, their packs were about 40lbs. I encouraged them to ask the Amicalola rangers to go through their packs with them before completely throwing in the towel but who knows. We wish them all the best.
The hiking day was jovial. It was a little overcast which helped keep the temperature comfortable. Slowly we started catching people from our shelter, them some really late starters from Hawk Mountain. By the time we got within 2 miles of Gooch, people were everywhere! In all we passed about 30.
There were lots of people already at the shelter by the time we got there. With more coming in behind us, we grabbed some of the last spots in the shelter. I quickly latched onto some young girls on their first backpacking trip with their dad. I could notice that there was lots of posturing by the older male thruhikers and I stayed out of those conversations.
We saw some behavior that went directly against what the rangers told us to do back at the arch that was disheartening (ex: washing dirty bowl out at water source). They didn't respond well to polite suggestions about alternative methods.
Weather is coming in. Undecided as whether to push it to Niels Gap (15mi) or stop short at Jarrard Gap (<10mi) right before the required bear canister section starts. We will see how we feel when we get there!","Stover Creek Shelter

People had been talking about the 100% chance of rain all day so we headed out in full rain gear even though it was just a drizzle. Soon we regretted it.
The fog was thick but we were glad to get out of Gooch. We arrived to Lance Creek very quickly- this was where we had decided to stop our day early so as to avoid the 5 mile bear canister section. After a long discussion and promises to offset these extra miles in the future, we pushed on.... in the rain gear!
The sun came out and we started to sweat but it meant great views on the summit. Met cheery locals too. I had to unzip almost the entirety of my pant legs. The people at Gooch had not only scared me about the nonexistent rain but also about the descent of Blood Mtn. It was one reason we were really hesitant to keep going that day but it was a piece of cake for us. With strong legs and light packs, we should not have worried as much as we did.
Made it to Mountain Outfitters at Niels Gap in time to get a frozen pizza and resupply. Hiked 10 minutes out and set up our tent right as the freezing rain started. It took some extra motivation to get our first bear hang up but we did.

But things can change quickly. Trail magic at Tesnatee Gap!!! A couple named Mitsy and Bobby had BBQ sandwiches, green beans, brownies, hot chocolate, fruits and more!! What kindness!

We had a relaxing morning and made some oatmeal before hitting the trail. It was really foggy all day while hiking. We kept leap frogging along the trail with the fun people we met the night before while chatting nonstop with Lumber. There was some trail magic in the form of chocolate eggs at Unicoi Gap. Instead of stopping at a camp spot we had discussed, we pressed through to Tray Mtn Shelter. 
We are trying to stay conservative with our miles but we pushed it today so we can set ourselves up for a full zero in Hiawasee starting tomorrow. 
Tray Mtn is in a beautiful spot out in this ridge. In the afternoon, some sun was popping out through the clouds and gave us a nice sunset.

Josh and I used the morning to get a few extra hours of R&R and icing the knee. Took the 11am shuttle out with the three guys we have been hiking near: Asshole, Sloppy Baggins, and Will. They had feasted on Hardee's and we had just tried to finish all the fruit and goodies we had bought at Ingles. Even so, we could not say no to the great trail magic at the trailhead. A group of 4 people from Georgia had BBQ sandwiches, chips, and cookies. They also had baguettes for us to hike out so we both strapped one to the outside of our packs. It was much appreciated and we started hiking with full stomachs!
My left knee was still sore which was a bummer for both Josh and I. There was a certain degree of ego that we had to battle with. The expectation was that we would be flying after that luxurious zero but that obviously was not the case.
Then all of the sudden, Ping!, my right IT band strains and pain shoots down to my foot. My foot is tingling! This really took the wind out of our sails. We had been planning on going 12ish miles to Muskrat Creek Shelter but I can already tell that ain't happening! 
It was a long, sweaty, smoky uphill to the North Carolina border. We broke bread their and passed the baguettes around with other hikers at the sign. While it was not as momentous in the moment due to our diminished moods, it was still pretty cool. This is the farthest Josh has ever hiked at once and the first time walking across a state boundary. 
Only 0.1 mile later is Bly Gap so we called it there. It was crowded but we knew some other hikers and got our laughs in still. We had a little chat about our mindset, recalibrated, and enjoyed the incredible sunset.
After a week on the trail, Josh has been kicking butt and I am extremely confident that this summer will go well for him. He has a lot to be proud of and has been really helpful these last two hiking days with my knees. I'm excited for what is to come for us!","Dicks Creek Gap

Today was the warmest night so far for us! Every time I rolled over in the night, I felt moist in my liner. We still got some good 'Z's in though and started hiking at about 9. Of course, it starts with a short but steep climbing. Every step hurt- I think Josh could hear some of my grimacing. Soon we pulled out the muffins (and ibuprofen) and it helped me forget about the pain for a little bit. 
Since we called it early the day before, we were a little unsure where we would end up today. The weather was clear and bright giving us lots of flexibility so we just started walking. The climbs and descents in the elevation profile looked more gradual than previous sections and thank goodness it was true. Josh had stopped to use the privy at Muskrat and didn't catch up for awhile so we got a long section of hiking separately. We saw some of our first green patches along the trail. The water options were great as were the views from Standing Indian Mtn.
Due to the mild terrain, my knees seemed to warm up and the pain was more intermittent! This was thrilling! Great conversation with Sloppy Baggins helped the miles fly too and next thing you know, we were at Carter Gap Shelter 15.3 miles away! I feel extremely fortunate- we passed some hikers (at least 4) that were stepping off the trail at Deep Gap because of injuries. So relieved that I am on the ups.
A great day on the trail continued into a great night. The thruhikers around us are an absolute hoot and there were some really cool section hikers too.","Bly Gap

We could tell it was foggy. The tin roof of the Carter Gap Shelter rang loud from water drops falling from the tree cover. People reading the weather report the night before made us think the rain would be coming so we set out in the sweaty rain jackets... notice a theme? 
The temperature stayed mild and we enjoyed the coziness of the trees with the low visibility. The hiking in these parts have an easier grade which my IT band was thankful for. We were eating up the miles while singing show tunes. Soon, we started sucking a little wind for the short, fun climb up to the fire tower on Albert Mtn. No view but a really fun section to spice up the day. 
From there, it was a rolling descent to Rock Gap Shelter. We passed the 100 mile marker. We enjoyed the little spouts of water someone built with rhododendron leaves at most of the springs. Our lunch of tuna and cheese tortilla wraps was enjoyed at the prettiest shelter we've seen so far, Long Branch Shelter. 
Comparatively, Rock Gap Shelter would be on the JV team of shelters but we were not complaining. Blue had reclaimed the sky and we enjoyed the afternoon reading, stretching, and chatting the hours away with the great hikers around us until after dark. Weather was the main talk around the campfire as it seems a couple of inches of rain may fall with it turning to light snow Sunday night. We still got Asshole, Sloppy Baggins, and Will. Then there is Millie whose Trail name is vigorously being contested. Big Kahuna is here along with Walk It Off, and Queen Bee & Grumble Bee. We also have been hanging out with 4 cool section hikers from GA and FL: Fix, Hustler, Dr. Blueberry, and Joe. Apart from Lumber, we also met Blazer who has thruhiked the AT and PCT too so we did some reminiscing together.
This may sound weird but I will always remember the privy from this shelter for two reasons:

It faced the trail from the royal throne so I waved and greeted about 10 hikers while in there
I had only the second 5-star poop in my life there. What that means is that you spot wildlife (in this case, a little songbird) and you both poop at the same time while making eye contact. It was amazing!

Tomorrow, the alarm is set early to maximize town time while trying to avoid the incoming weather. Looking forwards to some brews and a shower. Then onto the NOC where I will definitely be kayaking!","Carter Gap Shelter

We opened the door of the hotel room. It looked overcast and a very light snow was in the air. It was chilly but not freezing. We decided to grab the 9am shuttle back to the trail and we were not the only ones. There were a lot of hikers waiting in the parking lot; we didn't recognize most of them. This storm has clumped people together and reshuffled everyone up.
The ride to the trail was beautiful. As we climbed, the forest turned white. It was much colder up there and we had decided to hike in our shorts/skirt. We didn't want to get our longjohns wet nor did we want to become sweaty messes in our rain gear. What tested us most was the wind. Regardless of how fast we hiked, the wind would cut us in half. When we reached the top of our climb at the Wayah Bald summit. There was a thruhiker there waiting for a ride; he told us the next shelter ahead was full.
Our hearts dropped a little. We had not expected lots of people to be zero-ing in shelters that close to a town. Even though we had already put 10 miles in, there was still gas in our tanks and plenty of daylight left to make it to the next shelter, Cold Spring. We stopped in anyway and, without communicating to each other, were both glad we were not staying there. It smelled and everyone in there already seemed pretty miserable. Plus, we knew it would be a zoo once everyone from our shuttle caught up.
The temperature was dropping and the winds were gusting. Hikers heading the opposite direction were very bundled up! We held our breathe that there would be room in the Cold Spring Shelter but we were wrong. There were already 6 people in there and the group went silent when we inquired if there could be room for two more. It was not the reaction we expected but we couldn't force it. 
Hurriedly, we set our tent up and crawled into the shelter to cook our dinner. The hikers were friendly but were obviously, uncomfortably cold. After food and a pot of tea, we retreated into our tent and got into our sleeping bags. We cinched everything as tight as possible: our sleeping bag liners, the neck collars, and the face holes. We chatted and giggled until sleepiness drifted over us.","Franklin

The urge to pee reared its ugly head and I reluctantly had to get out of my sleeping bag. As I found later, it was 19 degrees outside. Luckily, my shoes were not ice blocks since they had not gotten very wet the day before. It was go time! We were both up and out in less than half and hour. We didn't do an eloquent packing job or anything but we wanted to get moving. It was going to be awhile for the sun to hit our location. 
The trail was icy!! After the trails had gotten 2-3inches of rain on Saturday and then froze, certain sections of the trail were long, thin ice rinks. It didn't take long for me to be elated. The ice and rime covered trees glistened once the sun hit them- it was my most beautiful day on the trail by far! Josh was just trying to get warm and shot off down the trail while I oooed and aaaed and took photos.
Cold Springs Shelter was at 4,926ft; our destination, the Nantahala Outdoor Center, was at 1,732ft. So as you can imagine, it was a lot of downhill. Even though my knees weren't happy, it lent itself to a marvelous landscape transformation. The ice started disappearing from the trees. Next the white snow was disappearing and being replaced by green plants. The air warmed up and it was time to peel off our puffies and put out warm hats away. Wesser Bald had a terrific observation tower giving us our first clear panoramic views of the trip. We got a clear look at the Smokies with a dusting of white. Also we ran into our buddy, Data, who we have been leap frogging with since our first night together in Stover Creek Shelter.
As the three of us went to our lowest elevation so far, the trees began to have leaves. We saw flowers of purple, then pink, yellow, and finally white. It wasn't muddy and there also weren't many water sources until we were within spitting distance of the NOC. 
For me personally, it felt as if the final miles were dragging on while Josh and Data chatted up a storm.
Once we made it to the NOC, we feasted at their restaurant which put us all into food comas. Josh and I stood in the freezing water for  10 whole minutes before we retired to the little cabin we reserved with Data and another hiker named Heather.","Cold Spring Shelter

This is why we are hiking. 
A buddy asked what I am trying to get out of this: ""You've already done a thruhike. How will this one be any different?""
On the PCT, I had to go fast; my goals were almost all miles based. Now on the AT with my partner, we want more. We want to experience the areas we walk through, deepen our relationship, take time to smell the roses, say yes to opportunities that come our way, and make the miles.
So today, we went BOATING!!! I've known about the NOC for years. Even as a kid hosting thruhikers, the NOC sounded like the one of the coolest places on Earth. My dad whitewater kayaks a lot and has since spent much time down there. Getting some water time was a big priority to me and Josh supported it. 
We enjoyed a lazy morning before renting 2 single-person inflatable kayaks. Also, we got two other hikers to join us, Produce and Zach. They shuttle you eight miles upriver and it was a fun Class 2 ride back to the campus with a single Class 3 rapid at the bottom. We were smiles all around and the valley we floated through was picturesque. It was Zach's first time whitewater kayaking. Produce said after today, the idea of aquablazing sounds very appealing. Josh was nervous to go. Most of his previous experience is our friends bringing him on rivers that are above his ability level so he swims a lot. This ride gave him so much confidence, especially after he ran the final rapid perfectly.
A bowl of chili for the road and we headed out to still get our miles in for the day. It was a long hot uphill to Cheoah Bald which presented some of my favorite views so far. I think the multi hour float in the sun drained me a little so I was more tired than expected for this climb. Honestly, it was the first time on this trip that I have felt fatigued; my legs were just tired. That was offset by good views of where we've been hiking the last couple of days and nice ridge walks. We got into Locust Gap around 7 and quickly set up camp and fell asleep.","Nantahala Outdoor Center

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588266,"After a starry night, it was clear and cold when we awoke from our slumber. Most people had not left camp before us except for Produce, a young Québécois woman whom we have been leap frogging with since the beginning like Data. Talking about some crazy dreams the night before made the couple of miles to Stecoah Gap fly by. 
We got picked up almost immediately and dropped off at an Ingles grocery store in the small town of Robbinsville, NC. We took some time to decide what we would need to get us to Gatlinberg, TN. The decision to resupply here means we would have to carry the food an extra 14 miles to the national park but it would be easier and more affordable to do our shopping in this town.
Before hitting the trail, I wanted a McGriddle; Josh decided to go for Wendy's. He says he had the best fast food experience OF HIS LIFE!! Shoutout to John from the Robbinsville Wendy's! 
We walked back to grocery store to hitch back and got a ride even before we stuck our thumbs out. The trail was steep leaving Stecoah Gap with our heaviest packs yet but easier than the day before. We caught Produce pretty quickly and the three of us stuck together the rest of the day. Cumulatively, it was mainly downhill with neither I or Produce are enjoying too much right now. Josh is still kicking butt like always and making it look easy! As always, conversation helped the miles past. 
We chose to skip the last shelter before Fontana Dam and hoped we would find a small unmarked campsite somewhere between there and Fontana. We traveled another 3 or 4 miles before we found one of my favorite spots so far. I will say it was during those 3 or 4 miles though where my feet and knee started to talk to me and I was thrilled when we found a site near water.
We had a deep real life talk around a fire, shared pain relief cream, helped each other hang our bear bags and had just a terrific night. The moon has been beautiful recently- it's a waxing crescent right now- and tonight was no different. There's something.... almost reassuring about getting back in tune with nature's rhythms and cycles in a way I am not in the day-to-day.","Locust Cove Gap

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588267,"Day 16- Another great day for Team Cheesy Josh! A lazy morning to ourselves at a stunning campsite was a great start. It was four miles along the edge of Fontana Lake to the Fontana ""Hilton"" Shelter. The shelter was large with bathrooms, a charging station, and a patio with a view yet it wasn't extremely appealing personally as a place to stay. My guess is that it is swarming with people and kind of loud. 
We continued onto the Fontana Dam Visitors Center where we got another AT Passport stamp from a sweet couple who volunteers there. They maintain a box of trail magic so we grabbed some cheese crackers and Josh got a little tour of their museum before heading out across the Fontana Dam and onto enter the Smokies National Park. 
Josh relayed the dam's history to me as we walked across the top of it. The sun was shining and we were a little giddy to be at this place that we had heard so much about. 
We deposited our backcountry permits at the park entrance and started the climb. It was hot but I wasn't finding it as difficult as the climb out of the NOC. Around the Dam, there was foliage creating nice shade. As we went higher, the trees were bare and I got super sweaty. The ascent was steady and brought us to the Shuckstack Fire Tower for some terrific views while we munched on a late lunch of tuna and cheese on tortillas.
Still more climbing ahead. This is when we started meeting other hikers heading to the same shelter. Once we were up on the ridge line within a couple of miles of the shelter, the trail began winding through these meadows filled with little white flowers! It was absolutely stunning and a great way to end the hiking day.
There were many people at the Mollie's Ridge Shelter already but we were still able to grab the final spots in the shelter. We met our first Ridgerunner of the Smokies named Carl who was an absolute rockstar. It's meeting people like him that makes me want to work with public lands in some form or another. We only knew two of hikers there and it gave us an opportunity to meet a lot of new thruhikers. 
It's exciting to finally be in the national park!! Tomorrow is forecasted to have clear, sunny skies and we cannot wait to see what the trail has to offer. If it is anything like today was, I'd be thrilled!","Streamside Campsite

The mood was light and a lot of people were ready to enjoy the sunny day. While we were some of the last people out of our sleeping bags, we still had a good head start on most people since we don't cook breakfast.
The day was mostly an ascent with lots of little dips and rises along the way. The weather couldn't have been any better so we decided to go for our biggest day so far. Rumors are that rain is coming tomorrow and we would love to get into Gatlinburg earlier rather than later. 
The landscape changed a lot and became a lot more like what I expected balds to be which is many grassy. There were still these tiny little white flowers with us through all the miles. We've figured out the flowers open and close with the temperature- very cool! Also, for most of today, my knees felt great.
There were four other people pushing with us: Unbound, Reflex, Ox, and Produce. We saw them periodically throughout the day. Birdsong was common and we spotted whitetail deer and large turkeys too. Still, we were very excited to have reached the shelter at the end of the day. I was tired and the shelter was almost empty compared to Mollies' the night before.

The AWOL guide showed a steady climb to Clingman's Dome but it didn't take long to tell it would be totally socked in. We still flew, partly in an effort to stay warm, and  suddenly we started to be surrounded by fir trees. The summit came up sooner than anticipated. We still walked up the observation ramp to read the informational signs. Due to the weather, it was underwhelming honestly. 
Soon, we were back in the tree cover. The footing was slick so I went really slow for lots of it because my knees were mad at me for yesterday. 
We would have made it Newfound Gap sooner but Josh and I got into our first tiff... over the BBQ potato chips! It was minimal but feelings were hurt and we ended up taking some time to hike apart to the road. We don't really fight but I have a habit of getting really mopey afterwards and I always just need a little bit of space or sleep.
It started raining when we reunited at the road but Josh was quick to sweet talk a couple into a ride. They were chatty and sweet ended up dropping us at big outdoor gear outfitters in town also called the NOC (they are connected). We had some time to kill and really smelled so we took them up on their offer of free showers in the staff area. I had to use my dirty hiking shirt to dry off but I didn't care- we were warm.
Gatlinburg is a foreign land as we were soon to discover. A short walk to a Dunkin Donuts revealed a tourist mecca with arcades, mini golf, souvenir shops, moonshine tasting, and more! It was a little Las Vegas without the casinos and instead surrounded by the national park. This is where we were picked up by our friend, Oceana. We had met her backpacking in Peru the year before and would not pass up the opportunity to reconnect.
Boy, did she give us the royal treatment!!! First off, she hooked us up with great lodging at the Westgate Resort where she works. This is the kind of place that has cookies when you check in. The room had a washer that also dried your clothes! Then, she and her roommate Kate, gave us the locals tour of Gatlinburg and neighboring Pigeon Forge. We sampled some moonshine at Ole Smokies and then had a terrific meal at a restaurant called the Local Goat. I felt a little underdressed in our long underwear but they made us feel so welcome and comfortable. 
After having a rough morning, all of those feelings were washed away and replaced with pure happiness and joy to be with Oceana and Kate. It felt like a whirlwind of a day but we were still home by 10 and immediately passed out!","

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588270,"Day 19- We were in an amazing apartment thanks to Oceana and we chose to lounge around instead of hitting up the indoor water park. As much as we wanted to, it would mean getting our undergarments wet right before hiking out into the rain for a couple of days. Plus, Waterworld was on TV :)
With our late checkout, we packed up at noon and used Oceana's car to get to a grocery store to resupply. It was across the street from an IHOP and we indulged before returning the car to Westgate. The 50 cent trolley took us back downtown to start hitchhiking back to Newfound Gap. The people watching was good and I know that we made for good people watching too in this touristy town.
Considering that our longest hitch so far took three cars to get a ride, this felt a bit longer. I don't hike with a watch but it was 30-45min of standing there with our thumbs out before a young couple picked us up. I don't think they had any idea what the AT was or that we were hikers but just wanted to do a good deed for the day- at least that's the vibe we got.
Will and Asshole were there when we pulled up. Wet and cranky, they encouraged us to hike fast to get room in the shelter. They also let us know Sloppy Baggins was on his 4th zero due to a knee injury. It was only three miles and it took us less than an hour to pull into an almost full Icewater Spring Shelter. There was one wide spot left. With some food bribery, the guys slid a little closer and Josh and I both filled the final nook against the wall. It seemed many other hikers had come from Newfound Gap and they were a bit of a friendly yet rowdy bunch. Most everyone was new to us but very engaging; it was fun overhearing new trail names and stories about other people's hike. Most hikers seem very eager to get out of the Smokies. We are looking forward to having more freedom for camping and therefore less clustering. A sunny day soon would be cool too!","Newfound Gap

The terrain for today looks steady with no major climbs or descents so we are going for it! The Smokies force mileage since we are required to stay at the shelters. We could've done 12 or 20 miles but the farther shelter was  1000ft lower in elevation and therefore warmer. 
We got our butts out at about 8am before most people. Many hikers were wet from the days before and there was a lot of dread about putting on their cold, wet socks.
The forecast is calling for more rain today though and we soon found our feet soaked through from the small rivers running down the trail. Instead of thunderstorms, we actually got some brightness through the fog. It actually created some really beautiful scenes with cool haziness through the trees. Everything was slick and there were some close calls to ending up in the mud. All the rain has helped make the forest smell. Josh had some really powerful moments of dejavú to running in the backcountry. We missed the plane wreckage noted in the guidebook but we were happy hikers all day.
We definitely felt some pressure to move fast today; the last 8 miles was a shelter dash. The ground is saturated and we really wanted space in the shelter to stay as dry for as long as possible. Slowly, we were passing people who had stayed one shelter closer and we knew it would be close.
Euphoria! There was space in the shelter! We immediately through our pads down and got settled in. I was feeling energetic and made the water run, made tea and dinner fetched some items for Josh who was relaxing after feeling some back pain. He's taken great care of me when I'm not on my A-game and it felt nice to return the favor to my best hiking buddy. We are so glad to be here tonight!","

With short mileage ahead (and mostly downhill at that), there was no need to rush out into the drizzly morning. Josh downloaded a Netflix series onto his phone at the IHOP that he has gotten wrapped into and I am finishing my second book.
We were almost the last ones out of the shelter. We gave each other thorough rundowns on the respective plots we are following as we started the long descent out of the Smokies. The forest quickly lost the mossy, evergreen feel in exchange for the leafy rhododendrons we have been used to so far. The day started a little overcast; it grew warmer and sunnier as we hiked on. The trail was extremely muddy from all this rain but it was still improvement! The trail was no longer a river and we didn't get the sopping wet effect in the shoes.
Today we got our lowest elevation so far to get under Interstate 40: 1372 ft. Even without trees, there were blazes guiding the way. They were painted along the bridge, the sidewalk, the Interstate signs and more. From there it was only a mile to the Standing Bear Hostel.
It was so coool there that it must be spelled with 3 ""o""s! It is a true oasis for hikers in such a perfect location. I could write so much about how great this place is but I will refrain. Josh and I resupplied there after enjoying some reheated pizza, corn dogs, and quesadillas. We indulged in some soda around the fire with other hikers before continuing on the trail.

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588272,"Day 22- Today we had bigger plans but called it early due to the cold rain. We stayed up late last night and slept in this morning. It had rained over night making the tent wet but it was gone by the time we woke up. We indulged in bagels and cream cheese from the Standing Bear Hostel the afternoon before and hit the trail. Many hikers who stayed at the hostel had started their hiking day earlier than ours and we were already in the thick of them. 
Our first climb was to Snowbird Mountain where we got our best views of the day. This was the first mountain that seemed like a true bald-every other peak has had at least some tree cover. Up there, we met up with Midlife, Bilbo, Help Desk, and Mad Lib and hiked with the later two for most of the afternoon.
The terrain was not too steep and conversations with new people made the miles past. As the day wore on, the grade of the inclines increased. The trail was muddy and you could feel your feet slide back in the steeper sections. 
Then the rain started again. From a drizzle to fat drops, we all adorned our rain jackets and kept moving. As we began the last stretch onto Max's Patch, the wind picked up. On the summit is where we lost Mad Lib. Even in the rain, he wanted to camp there to have an opportunity to see the sunset and sunrise. 
In exchange for Mad Lib, we picked up Midlife and the four of us moved together as the mud became more treacherous and slowed our pace. I was laughing out loud as Midlife and I slid down the side of Max's Patch. It got cold pretty quick and my knees tightened before we even reached the tree line again. The next 1.9 miles were quiet into the Roaring Fork Shelter as we tried to concentrate on not wiping out.
The book says it fits 10 but we are really tight at 9 people. We had intended to push to the next shelter in 5 miles but we chose to get out of the rain and grab a slice of floor space instead. It was only 2:30 but we feel it's the right decision. We will still hit Hot Springs, NC tomorrow but it will now be an 18 mile day instead of a 13.

The rain had stopped overnight but it was still a drippy, foggy mess. We dressed and zoomed out of the shelter with hopes of flying into town. But the mud had other plans!
Ahh the mud! I think we have yet to be as frustrated as we were today. Not only does it slow you down, but the fast micro adjustments you make as you slip and slide everywhere kind of hurt. For me, it was my knees. For Josh, it was his back that he had tweaked a couple days before. Last night, I had been thinking to myself, ""Maybe we don't need a zero"". After today, we need a zero!
Making it to Hot Springs, NC was great! We stayed at the Hostel at Laughing Heart Lodge. I knew I would like this place because they had spare town clothes for us to wear while doing laundry etc. There is something about being able to put on a normal cotton T-shirt that just feels good!
Immediately after checking in, we departed to feast at the local diner (yum!). Then we wandered back to hostel for showers, laundry, and a beer with our new buddy Midlife and section hiker Corporate.
My energy was slowly fading but Josh rallied. He put on a teddy bear sweater from the town clothes and jaunted down to the Spring Creek Tavern where he had an impressively spicy buffalo chicken sandwich.","Roaring Fork Shelter

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588874,"Day 25- It was so so nice to get out of town today! We woke up naturally and started packing our bags. Some buddies had already hit the trail and others were spending the day in Hot Springs. The breakfast biscuit sandwiches at the Hillbilly Market required a Round 2 so we stopped in on our way out of town. We passed some other hikers who invited us to soak with them at the hot springs but I knew I would not want to climb out of town after a relaxing session. It's easy to see how people get stuck in cool towns like this.
Begrudgingly, we hiked up and out of town. Early on, there were gear issues today: a falling sock and a snapped trekking pole. With it being Sunday morning and us already atop the main ascent out of town, I decided to push on with a single pole- we could get creative at camp tonight.
I felt lethargic today. My pack was its heaviest of the trip and, for whatever other reasons, I did not fly uphill today. Straight sunshine and the best partner helped the miles fly. The climb culminated with a cool side trail to see the Rich Mountain Lookout Tower. Every other stair had been removed and the floor boards weren't completely intact but it was cool nonetheless. 
Only a few miles later was the Spring Mountain Shelter where we caught up to two hikers named Big Bear and Corporate. They were to become our hiking buddies for the rest of the day. We would mainly hike with Big Bear and then stop every so often to wait for Corporate to catch up as she is injured but hobbling well. Towards the end of hiking day, Big Bear put on Siberian throat singing and that was unexpectedly perfect to get those last miles into Log Cabin Road.
Our campsite was on the ridge nearby and we were able to watch the full moon rise from there. The weather felt perfect and we didn't put the rain fly on the tent. We chatted for hours and had too much fun. It's nice hiking with other people sometime!","Hot Springs,NC

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588876,"Day 26- We woke up later than usual; the sun had already begun to hit us. We still started walking at around 8:45. It was a long uphill that I had been kind of dreading since the night before so Josh and I decided to hike separately and at our own paces. I put a podcast on and he played his tunes (for only the third time this whole trip) and the climb was over before we knew it.
We reconvened at the next water source and also started our full day leap frog with Big Bear and Corporate. There was not a cloud in the sky and we were all smiles. After this main climb, the rest of the day was pretty much a long ridge walk that eventually turned into a gradual descent. 
The first highlight of the day came at White Rock and Blackstack Cliffs that gave full views of either side of the ridge. We explored these with the hilarious pair, Bo and Willet, whom we have also been leapfrogging with for a couple of days. From there, we read about a ""strenuous and rocky"" section of trail that brought us to Big Firescald Knob. It took a little bit of time to make it into the meat and potatoes of it but it was actually kind of fun even though it was slow going. Little scrambles here and there with natural seeming steps.
The section only lasted a mile but was a good send off for the 200-miles as our next way point was passing 300 miles!!! Whoohoo!
Lunch was at Jerry Cabin Shelter around 2pm where we met some guys who had night hiked over that last ridge under the full moon- that sounded really cool. Also Josh got trailnamed Broken Seal- more on that in a separate post. After some really cool fields along the trail and summiting the underwhelming named Big Butt Mountain, the descent started and we flew. We covered 9 miles in a little over 3 hours before setting up camp for evening at the end of an old road bed. We were unsure if Corporate and Big Bear were going to push this late into the day but we were glad they did. We all struggled with our bear hangs but at least we were together.","Log Cabin Road campsite

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588877,"Day 27- Today was the best day so far!
Woke up with the sun. Lots of climbing in the trail forecast for today but was feeling frisky fresh!
Pretty quickly we passed a thruhiker giving trail magic in the form of cold beers he'd left in the river overnight. It was not even 9am.
Up and up we go. Josh says that today was the first day it felt like Spring! The ground was super lush with tons of flowers and the sky was blue! Our first peak today was Lick Rock with a clear view of the day ahead. Sometimes it is exciting and enticing to see where you are going to be hiking next. In this case, it was daunting. Big Bald lay ahead (and above us) which is where we were planning on ending the day.
I was still feeling good when we approached Hogback Ridge Shelter for water and privy time. The cell service was great there and I discovered that one of our original and favorite thruhiker buds, Data, had left the trail. That took the wind out of my sails. He left for love, to spend time with his wife, which is completely understandable but we will miss him and we're bummed we didn't get to say goodbye.
We caught up to Corporate and Big Bear for lunch. It was a hot one today and everyone was fatigued or hurting in one way or another. Corporate was getting low on food and discussed how lucky we would be if there was trail magic at Sam's Pass in 0.8miles where we crossed under I-26. But it's Tuesday and I was pessimistic.
I was also wrong, thankfully! We passed some older gentlemen near the pavement letting us know that they had lunch for us!!! Burgers, hotdogs, multiple salads and slaws, cookies, fruit, cold soda, chairs, a hand washing station and more. Every year this group of guys sets up this shindig on May 1st; this is at least their 12th year doing it.
It was a true gift that made me cry a little and put all the wind back in my sails. The only downside was a very full belly after two lunches. So after an hour of gorging and chatting, we moaned and groaned our way back up. It was hot and I was not feeling good! Josh was a sweetheart and put my buff under some cold water and let me wear it. That made a huge difference. 
It took us awhile to make it the next 5-6 miles to the summit of Big Bald with our food babies. It was stunning and offered the best views of the whole trip! 360 degrees panorama and we indulged up there until sunset. We had all bundled up and relaxed and nibbled while we waited for the glorious sun to fall. It turned a fiery red before diving behind the mountains which was our cue to turn the headlamps on and go about 1 mile to Big Bald Shelter. We creeped in silently to not wake anyone but there was no one to be woken!! I saw a food bag hanging by the bear cables but almost immediately a woman named Gouda Girl yelled ""Welcome"" from her tent behind the shelter. I think she was glad to have company. Josh and I lay in the empty shelter after this terrific day by 9:30.","Roadbed (north end) Mi 310.2

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589186,"It was hard to rouse ourselves today. Between hiking late last night and knowing me that end in town today, our sleeping bags set ups just felt so comfortable. Although we didn’t get out late we were deafly the last ones to leave. Hiking was really pleasant. We are still really Highup but the ridge and humps we were going over retreated treating so the view the grand views were a bit diminished compared to the stunning show we had the night before. Cumulatively it was going to be allotted of downhill today so we expected to go a bit faster. As of the morning we had decided whether or not we would do a quick race find Erwin and hit the trail or end up staying in town. Didn’t take long before I realized today was going to be a hot one. As we approach noon it was hard to stay string cheese my body wanted to become fondue. As we traversed the spine‘s and valleys coming off the big ridge where we had camped, We got a little worn down. It felt like we were moving so fast and yet every time we came around the corner the shelter we had planned to have lunch was not there. As the temperature rose I started to feel more and more lethargic but was driven by hunger and our objective to reach no business Shantan. Of course there was a little uphill we had not realized to make it to the shelter but but we are relieved once we saw the picnic table. From there the day really turned into a hard grind. The trail became more Rowley and that, along with the heat, made the hiking really difficult for me personally. Josh of course was being his usual helpful self and that really made the difference in getting down into Irwin efficiently. He played fun music and it times we shared a quick dance as well. We could see her in a couple miles before we actually reached at. We heard a train choo-choo and got great views of the Nola Chuckie as we came into town. Immediately once we stepped off the dirt and onto the pavement we saw uncle Johnny’s hostile right there in the corner. After getting my butt kicked today on the trail it was not too hard of a decision to decide to stay here for the night. While we had preferred maybe a more typical Mom at hotel setting for the night, hostas like these are hard to resist when they have all the services that a hiker would need at one location. We had made it into the hospital at four which is enough time to set up our tent in the backyard and get sorted before the 5 PM shuttle into town. As we are trying to get ready we got some bad news from home that a friend had been injured in a backcountry ski avalanche back accident accident. We tried to car but the shed I was leaving and had to delay our messages of love an information gathering for later. The van is absolute packed; and dropped us off in the Walmart parking lot. Before heading in to resupply we decided to leave chow down in a Mexican restaurant in a lot. I’m not going to dwell on it too much but let’s just say it was the worst Mexican food I’ve had in my life and I barely made a dent in the place. It was a bit disappointing and honestly, I spent a lot of time thinking about that experience for many days to come. We rounded out today by resupplying at Walmart And cramming back into the van to the uncle Johnny’s hast. One of the work for stairs hope the scooter laundry started and I had a nice hot shower. I’ve been worried about camping into the yard due to the number of people that as darkness found it was actually pretty quiet and peaceful.","Bald Mountain Shelter

Up, up and away! Leaving a town is always a little hard and today was no different. We woke up to a dew covered tent and used that as an excuse to make oatmeal from the hiker box and eat a freeze-dried ice cream sandwich a buddy, Handstand, gave us. Then someone came and dropped off trail magic fruit for hikers! Needless to say, we got spoiled.
We said goodbye to Corporate who ended her section hike here in Erwin and finally started hiking at 10. Today was going to be all uphill and I chose a pace to reflect that. We started at 1,662 feet of elevation and would top out at 5,180 feet. To add to the uphill, it was hot. I had to try really hard to not become fondue!!
Right before Indian Grave Gap, my tummy needed to evacuate!! I ran into the woods and had, by far, my worst poo of the trail!! While I was moping down the trail to catch up to Broken Seal, I saw trail magic at the road. Brother Tom was there with cold lemonade, water, and brownies. We lunched there and listened to other hikers chat. 
The hiking past that point was brutal due to no shade and barely any breeze. A steady pace and teamwork helped the miles go by. Just before Beauty Spot Gap, there are terrific views and there were many hikers lounging at the top. It was there that we met Wings and we proceeded to hike with him for the rest of the day. He's a sweet guy about our age from New Brunswick, Canada. He and Broken Seal have a lot in common and chatted all down the trail. Once in a while, I would hang back and hike alone thinking about life and admiring the surroundings. 
With our slower pace, we decided to dinner at Cherry Gap Shelter and then hike on a little more. While everyone was really kind, it took no time at all to tell it was an interesting crew of people hanging out there and we were glad to keep moving.
As the sun got lower in the sky, the forest changed completely. Different sounds, different colors. We called it at the first campsite after Iron Mountain Gap. We struggled to get our bear hang up, which has been happening recently, and snuggled up after saying goodnight to Wings","Erwin, TN

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589189,"Day 30- Iron Mountain Gap (364mi) to Overmountain Shelter (387.2mi) (total 23.3)
I would peek my head over the fabric part of our tent to periodically check the sunrise through the mesh. The night had been completely silent and the moon moved in an arc that I had incorrectly guessed. The morning was lackadaisical but not too bad with an 8:30am start. Wings was packed up before us and waited- he was gonna spend the whole day with us.
He's a great conversationalist and we chatted steadily the whole day making the rolling elevation to the base of Roan Mountain pass quickly. At one point, we crossed paths with Handstand and Psych slackpacking south for the day and they said there may be trail magic after the summit for us! All bets were off for where we had planned to lunch; we were going to hike straight to Carver's Gap and test our luck.
The miscommunication happened not too much later than that. It was getting hot and I was getting sweaty as we started the long climb back up to 6,000 feet. To prevent problems, I realized I needed a quick stop to put a bra on. The last thing Josh said to me was ""We'll go slow"".
They only kind of did and after 15 minutes of speed hiking I knew they were just having a dandy ole time chatting it up. I didn't mind except that Josh had the map too and I was not extremely confident about the waypoints we would be hitting today. We had briefly talked about lunching at Carvers Gap so that was my backup plan if I didn't see them before hand.
The Roan Mountain summit is not pronounced and I walked right by the technical top. I was so engrossed in the beautiful smell of the spruce-fir forest. You know how smells can trigger deep memories? I was being sent back in time to transformative backpacking trips in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. It was great having the time to myself to have some of these deeper, inner conversations. 
I came across a group of hikers sitting on the side of the trail and asked if they had seen men fitting Josh's and Wing's descriptions. They pointed up a side trail to a shelter with water. I assumed they were just refilling and told the group I was going to push on to Carvers Gap (for the potential trail magic) but I was getting hungry.
The moment of terror struck when I got lost. I'd missed a sharp turn while having these deep thoughts. Suddenly my brain is racing- where am I, how far back did I get off the trail, what if the guys run by trying to catch up to me, I don't have a map or cell service, and finally, grrrr, now I have to walk back uphill retracing my steps to find the AT again. Luckily, it only took five minutes before I saw that group of hikers whom I'd spoken with earlier. They had relayed the message of me pressing on and the boys had not run ahead yet!
I made it to the trail magic first. They trail angels were absolute sweethearts and helped me trick the boys by telling them we were all out of food and drinks when the arrived. It got a good laugh. I sipped on Cheerwine (like a cherry cola) with Cheetos and a banana in my lap while lounging in a reclining lawn chair. It was fun.
After enjoying our lunch and trail magic and reuniting as a trio, we tackled the final miles of the Roan Highlands. It was the longest Bald ridge we have had the privilege of walking so far. I can see why people saw it's a highlight of this area with its great views. It seems like a true gem.
Also a gem was the Overmountain Shelter where we decided to spend the night. It's well-known and we were glad our day naturally coincided with staying there. It's a big converted barn with a great view from the top of a forested valley (and a privy with a bedazzled seat lid, ha!). There were at least fifteen tents set up when we rolled in around five and realized it was almost all weekenders. The thruhikers were in the barn so that is where we rolled out our sleeping pads. After some stretching and back massages on the grass lawn, we cooked dinner and mingled with all of the cool hikers new to us. Someone finally showed us what ramps, a local wild onion, looks like and got confirmation that the Roan Mountain Hiker Fest was in fact happening tomorrow. All in all, today was a great and fun day!","Iron Mountain Gap

People were going up and down the ladder, flashing their headlamps towards us, and even smoking in the barn throughout the night. I slept really hot last night with my sleeping bag and got my long johns wet with sweat. This rendered any sleep combo without my sleeping bag too cold. The conclusion: our worst sleep on the trail!
The forecast predicted rain for today; thunderstorms potentially starting at 9am. We had set an alarm but all the commotion in the morning meant we were up before it and hiking by a record 7am. In some ways, it was a gift. We didn't know we had more bald highlands to hike across and we got terrific light. 
For the first time, we think our guide book is wrong.The AWOL guide said it was only 7 miles to US-19 with an absolutely insane downhill after crossing over from NC to TN for good. We never found the scary descent yet it took us much longer time-wise to cover those 7 miles.
A quick hitch into Roan Mountain, TN (the town) showed us that our perceptions of the Roan Mountain Hiker Fest were way off!! It was a trail maintenance day (everyone had already set off) with live music in the evening. This meant no farmers market; the thing I had been food dreaming about for days. Local cheeses, artisanal breads.... yummmm.
Josh thought I would be upset but we got a ride to Smoky's Bakery and had the absolute best pizza of the trail. Also, Saturday's special is buy four pizzas, get a fifth free! We gorged over some soda with Wings and another Canadian we met just before the road named Double D.
Before hitching back to the trail, the guys wanted some more cold drinks which brought us to Bob's Dairyland and we all got milkshakes. Someone discovered they had wifi so I updated the journal and Josh watched sports while Wings video chatted with his girlfriend who is preparing to join him for a couple of weeks.
The hitch back to the road was easy but we were left with a warning. It's best to hike the next 9 miles to the shelter. If you have to stop before, don't camp even remotely close to houses, dirt roads, or the cemetery. A local family had their land ""taken"" to accommodate the trail and the brothers will run you out if they've been drinking.
Luckily, we had been planning on going to the shelter and we made jokes about it as we hiked. As you can imagine, this meant we were stunned when we found Cinco de Mayo trail magic at a random backcountry road crossing. Two thruhikers from 2015, Lookout and Rico Suave, had Coronas and chips and salsa to eat while they made juicy burgers and delicious pork tacos. They had made a lot by hand and it was really amazing. They even had veggie burgers for Wings. We were their last hiker trash of the day so they gave us the final beers to pack out and individually-wrapped Reeses cups and little Snickers. On top of the greatness, the hiking to the shelter was cool! We passed the 400 mile marker, took a quick side trail Jones Falls, and walked along the Elk River.
It was nice getting to Mountaineer Falls Shelter and seeing some of the cool people we had met at the converted barn the night before. Our dinner was beer and the rest of our pizza.

During my first steps out of the hostel towards breakfast I started to feel my calf cramping up. I instantly thought, I must be dehydrated from the adult beverages and salty town food so I grabbed a couple bananas and a big thing of water. I put all this down quicker than goose poop sliding down a hot tin roof, and began to hike. I was feeling ok but was concerned of getting more cramps so I continued to pound fluids like I was at a frat party. Because of all this I was having to use the restroom...ALOT, and String Cheese, Bear, and Corporate found it very comical. The day finally ended and I was able to fight off the cramps successfully, whew.
The next day we started hiking and Bear and Corporate were laughing about my absurd amount of pee breaks and said it was like I didn’t have any sort of seal. Then like a bolt of lightning from Zeus himself my trail name was born. Broken Seal. I chuckled and thought, I’ll take it.

I thought I was in a sports arena. I could feel the wooden platform vibrating from people stomping their feet with excitement. There was roaring! Then I woke up... a fierce storm had rolled in. Instead of feet, it was a downpour of rain with 'dings' of hail as it pummeled the roof of the shelter. It was so incredibly loud. The thunder was barely discernible; the flashes of light were our only clue to try and listen for it. Broken Seal and I giggled and gasped. It was over almost as fast as it started. We cuddled up and went back to sleep.
The next time we awoke, the sunlight was slanting through the forest canopy. It was beautiful; everything around was alive and refreshed. We packed up and ventured north with Wings. The elevation profile for this page was the most gradual I think we have had yet. It was never entirely flat but every climb and descent was short. 
We were averaging 3 mph the whole morning as we chatted about everything from sports and music to jokingly laying out the rules for our thruhiker cult. The temperature was mild with glimpse of sunlight at times and misty drizzles at others.
At lunch we called the hostel where we had planned to end our day and discovered we were out of private rooms. Normally we would stay in bunks but once in awhile we have to carve out ""us"" time. This ended up being a great twist of fate! We were going to pass a road earlier in the day with a hostel called Big Bear Resort and they had some cabins left. It was going to be hard to feel like our day had been cut short but the amazing Stephanie had the solution: slackpacking!
The rain finally started as we crushed the final miles into her resort around 2, ate lunch, and were riding in a shuttle to where we had intended to end our day. It would be 9 miles back to our warm, dry cabin. Wings had claimed the Frozen-themed pink daypack and Broken Seal sweetly carried ours with water and some snacks. It felt like he was carrying feathers.
We entered the Pond Flats Wilderness area and thoroughly enjoyed it. The hiking was easier and we got to see some friends who were just ahead of us by hiking southbound for the afternoon. Plus, the sun came out!
My favorite part was walking along the Laurel Fork river. On addition to its beautiful waterfall, the afternoon light down into the small canyon was so scenic. The rhododendrons were starting to bloom too! The hiking was rocky and we were glad we had trekking poles and no packs. In some ways, it was one of my top sections recently when not compared to the balds; they are just too different.
We showered and reheated from sandwiches from the little store. Some other hikers zeroing had prepared bacon alfredo pasta and invited us to share it with them.

Egg, cheese, and sausage on a croissant. Microwave for 90 seconds. That was the start of this pleasant day.
The three of us slept very well in our little creekside cabin. After the school drop off, we got into their little store to microwave breakfast and get our laundry started. I spent the morning in my puffy and a towel doing our resupply and picking through a hiker box. We took a shuttle at 10:15 after the dryer finished up back to where we had started our southbound slackpack the day before. 
There was no service at the resort so we videocalled Broken Seal's family from the trail. We got to give his young nephews a glimpse of what we are doing. They seem enamored by Uncle Broken Seal; you could see their gears turning trying to figure it all out. 
The morning on the trail was spent walking along the edge of Watauga Lake and across the dam. We saw a black snake and butterflies and lots of hikers. After the dam, we got up on this beautifully scenic ridge that allowed us to look down and across the lake for most of the day.
Water crossings were spaced out today. I hiked separately from Wings and Broken Seal whose bromance is blooming rapidly and would catch up at the water sources. 
We had our best lunch spot today sitting on some cliffs overlooking the lake. I said goodbye to the guys and had a terrific afternoon cruising along the ridge sola. It was pleasant and I spent a lot of time contemplating my privilege in being able to take on this adventure.
Even with the blue skies, we could hear thunder in the distance and took the final spots in the Iron Mountain Shelter. As usual, we were snuggled in with people all new to us along with a brave mice who made an appearance before it got dark. A lot of people we had passed through the day filed into the shelter and talked around a fire while the whole shelter turned in for the night. It made for good people-listening and gave us a glimpse into tramilies- these large groups of hikers moving together.

The sunrise was cool from the shelter this morning with the pinks and oranges cutting through the forest outlining an array of tents.
Most people in the shelter were gone by 6:30. We slept in, like always. It's a perk of knowing we could get the miles in regardless of when we get up.
The elevation profile today looked flat and it was! In a twist, there were moments today when I missed the climbs and descents. They break up and create the day into separate but distinct parts. We were saved by the fact that it wasn't a full blown green tunnel. We were pretty much walking a straight,tree-covered ridge line all day. There was one cool farm meadow we walked through with views of valley we were above and tons of little birds.
The three of us hiked together all day and had two lunches at each of the two shelters we passed. We discovered Broken Seal and Wings both know how to knit and we started brainstorming trail names for Wings' girlfriend who is prepping to come section hike with him.
Water sources were not plentiful today and while the hiking was incredibly easy, I could sense we were getting fatigued due to dehydration. We had one way marker still pulling us ahead: the TN/VA state border! The water source we were hoping to camp near was just a mile on the VA side.
After snapping some pics, we found new people already set up near the spring. They were all friendly and we joked around the fire with them while eating our Knorr Rice Sides dinners. Someone made a comment about people cooking over a fire and next thing you know, Broken Seal is making us a second course of cheese quesadillas! I also prepared some hot chocolate, our first of the trip.
We are excited to make it into Damascus tomorrow. We are arriving a little over a week before Trail Days but we definitely intend to go! If you have been following us from the beginning, you may remember that both of our parents are coming to visit this week! With them in mind, we are going to skip ahead (to where we don't know yet) so that we can save the Grayson Highlands to hike it with them!

Woke up to my most brilliant sunrise on the trip from where we were camped on the side of Whitetop Mountain. I actually took a small walk to watch the sun crest over the neighboring peak before anyone else got up.
After snuggling Big Mac awake from his slumber in his car set up, Midlife parted ways with us to hike on. We had shared the parking lot with two accomplished hikers named Nomad and Jojo who gave us some great advice on trails all over!
We chowed on bagels and hit the road to drop Wings off. After an almost tearful goodbye, we found ourselves in Marion, VA for lunch and planning time. We stumbled into the office of a really nice chiropractor who gave Broken Seal a good session and some advice on how to mitigate some of his back pain from a slip in the Smokies. We had some of our best food on the trail at the Wooden Pickle; they were kind enough to let us explode our maps across the table and we made reservations for the next couple of nights. Did our food resupply at an Ingles and then set camp up at the Mt Rogers Nat. Recreational Area HQ. They had a hellbender in an aquarium and dropped a bunch of minnows in when we arrived. It definitely looks like a dinosaur!
We ate salad and fried chicken with cookies to wash it down behind the Partnership Shelter where we set our tents up for the night. We had a small fire and talked with Produce, Wings, and other new hikers.

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591183,"Day 41 - Rocket was the first one to get up that morning but we weren’t too far behind. Broken Seal had a terrific night of sleep; one of the best he’s had in awhile. I could hear Dad groaning as he was stretching and waking up. He was feeling great as well even after we had kind of kicked his butt the day before. The news that Rocket had given us the night before about a potential cafe just 3 miles down the trail motivated us to get moving down the trail. Dad started his breakfast with a Sprite and coffee;  then we had some amazing biscuits and gravy along with sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwiches. The trail leaving the cafe took us over I-77 and then back into the woods. It was our longest stretch of road walking but still wasn’t much. Dad was getting a great snapshot of different aspects of the trail and some of the infrastructure around it. 
We didn’t know we would also be facing some of the longer dry sections on the trail so far. It was nothing major but it made us take a 0.6 mile side trail to a water source so we could refill before a 9 mile drive section; Dad kept hiking on. At the source, we saw two deers hopping around enjoying life. It took a long time for us to catch Dad on the flats; he’s a pretty speedy guy but I learned my lesson the day before and didn’t scare myself with how long it took us to catch him. 
The terrain was really enjoyable; there wasn’t anything too remarkable about it. We found a nice, flat spot to have lunch and Big Mac told me embarrassing stories which always helps the time fly by. We wrapped up eating just as a huge clap of thunder rolled through. Luckily we saw the flash of lightning nearby so it didn’t scare us out of our skin is completely. On went the rain jackets just as it started pouring on the trail. There’s something about thunder- it can be really fun when you know you’re in a somewhat safe location. We knew this was just the first wave of the storm that was coming our way and we made it to the road where Ellen and Benny, Broken Seal's parents, were supposed to pick us up. 
Finding these random road crossings in the backwoods of a place you’ve never been before can be very tricky but they found it on their first try and were there waiting for us right before the heavy downpour commenced. We were all absolutely elated to see them on so many levels. They were exhausted understandably having spent the whole day and most of the night traveling but were such troopers. We guided them down wet, windy country roads as the really heavy rain started. 
First we needed to return to Burkes Garden to retrieve dad‘s car from the hostel and then get to a nice hotel in Bluefield to set Broken Seal up for success the next day in regards to his graduate school online interview. The skies were scary shades of dark gray and black and I think we were all excited to be in a car rather than on the trail or hiding out in some shelter. By the time we made it to the hotel, everyone was exhausted so we ordered a huge meal from the local pizza place. We set up a faux dining table in the lobby and we ate our hearts out. We were all dry, we were all well fed, and, most importantly, we were all together!","Campsite with Views

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591184,"Day 42 - Today was the day that Broken Seal had been waiting for for weeks! After enjoying the continental breakfast thruhiker style, he returned to his room and get all dressed up for his online interview with a prospective graduate school. Seeing him and his nice button up shirt and tie highlighted some of the ways in which his body has changed so far on the trail. I got to hang out with Big Mac, Ellen, and Benny downstairs people watching and sending Broken Seal all of the good luck fuzzies we could from downstairs. We watched the clock and waited with anticipation. After his time-slot was over, Broken Seal came into the lobby with a huge smile across his face; my heart feel all warm. We chatted for a while about the very great interview he had; he was asked some interesting questions and was able to get some of his own questions answered too. We shifted gears and prepared for a short slackpack in the afternoon. Unfortunately, the rain had not stopped yet so Ellen’s first hike on the Appalachian Trail was going to be a wet one. Nonetheless, everyone was in high spirits and, after snapping some photos of the team at the trailhead, we started venturing into the forest. The tree cover helped with the heavy rain and Ellen was really enjoying herself. It’s definitely much greener out here than in northern Arizona (ha ha). It was a smooth 5 miles but it included different elements of the trail we’ve crossed so far: things like rocky, steep sections, muddy stretches, and the rain. We wrapped up the hike in a fabulous way. As we descended towards the road, we entered a very scenic field filled with cows. After sharing some laughs about the cows' antics and a moment of mindfulness, we crossed a beautiful suspended bridge over a big river with Benny waiting for us on the other side.The only stinky thing that happened was that my phone got pretty wet even in a rain jacket pocket (I hadn’t really thought that one through). We returned to the hotel for a warm shower and relaxation time before meeting up at an amazing Mexican restaurant called El Patio Grill. After having some of the worst Mexican food in my life in Erwin, this was a huge upgrade and we were all extremely impressed with the food and we walked out with full bellies.  It was hard not to fall asleep immediately after hitting the bed.","Lickskillet Hollow

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591191,"Day 43- Our 6 AM alarm today was set to ""I Touch Myself"" by Divinyls. It’s probably the earliest we've woken up in a while.  We were planning on doing a full marathon day from where we left off to reach Pearisburg by the evening. The third straight day of rain and rain is in every day's forecast for the next week. Today is supposed to rain the hardest and the parents opted to not hike today as there were not many road crossings to make this a shorter mileage option. 
As we wolfed down more continental breakfast, we were noticed by a large Amish family staying at the hotel for a wedding. This is the first time Josh has ever seen Amish people in his life. I’m sure we were looking pretty funny in our very dirty rain gear and voracious breakfast appetite. Luckily, the rain wasn’t too hard as we drove back to the trail head. There were some people camping at the parking lot; they looked a little miserable but were packing up nonetheless. 
The first 8 miles of today absolutely flew by. I think it might be the fastest we hiked yet. All the rain has made the trail a muddy mess with tons of puddles and rivers running down them so it didn’t take very long to become saturated. All the moisture did make it look very beautiful though. It’s a different way of seeing the forest. When we finally stopped for water and a snack bar, we acknowledged that we have awesome parents and we would rather spend the afternoon spending time with them. We had reservations at a hostel midway through the hiking day 15 miles from where we started. We called our parental units from a high ridge and they liked the plan. They said they were completely and totally interested in doing the 11 miles from the hostel tomorrow morning into Pearisburg and then we would all drive to Trail Days together. Knowing that our day was suddenly only 15 miles total instead of 26 made our hiking pace change from really fast to really slow. The rain had started to let up and we started to goof around more as we moved down the trail. 
Something I haven’t mentioned yet is that we had a lot of aggressive wildlife interactions today. It started with a small but mighty crawfish near one of the river crossings. By the time I saw it in the center of the trail, it was up on its rear legs, claws up in the air snapping. Josh bravely and valiantly got it off the trail. Then, two snake encounters. They weren't aggressive, just  scared us a little. The most aggressive of them all was a snapping turtle! It was in the center of the trail and it’s our habit to try and get all bugs and animals off the trail so they don’t get stepped on by someone else - this case was no different. It didn’t take much poking and prodding for it to become defensive understandably. But this little bugger is feisty and it took a lot of time to safely get him to the edge of the trail corridor.
The hiking ended with our arrival to Sugar Run Gap and the Woods Hole Hostel run by the one and only Neville. Choosing to stay here was a home-run decision! The property had the coolest, quaint cabins surrounding well-down raised beds bursting with plant life. There was a creek running through it with a duck pen and a long field running down the valley for goats, pigs, and cows. Also, there was a friendly dog roaming around and a handful of cats that were not averse to setting up shop on your lap or in your arms. Dad and I had good talks on the porches around the property. Yoga was at 4:30 on the front lawn and then it went right into dinner prep. Neville runs this shop so smoothly with random people helping her make meals every day; I think her secret is patience. I bonded with her work-for-stay employee as I prepared Chicken of the Forest mushrooms that someone had foraged.
The communal dinner was astounding delicious. The ambiance, the spirit of this place- wow! This a really special stop along the trail and I am very grateful to have shared it with the people I love.","VA 606 Parking Lot

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591195,"Day 43 – Today’s wake up was a bit more blissful. The Wood's Hole Hostel provides bathrobes and I spent the morning journaling and then helping to prepare breakfast all in the gloriously, fluffy, brown bathrobe. To say the least, I really like this place and it was nice waking up here. Looking down the field, we were completely socked in and the decision was unanimous to go straight to Trail Days instead of slackpacking the 11 miles to Pearisburg. Making that decision meant we were very relaxed and got to enjoy the great communal breakfast that was prepared for us. We had veggie egg scramble, homemade bread, sausage, peach crisp and home roasted coffee! We all pitched in to help out in cleaning our rooms so that the staff could get to Damascus as well. Broken Seal drove off with his parents.  Bid Mac and I headed down separately in his car chatting about how much we enjoyed the place and the people. Got one of my favorite AT Passport stamps too!  
Trail Days was in full swing with gear tents and music. Almost immediately, we started recognizing people from along our whole hike from the first day to more recent encounters! It was so much cooler than I had anticipated. There was so much going on, so many raffles, so much to look at. I’m really glad that we came! In addition to the general swag and stickers we tend to collect at these types of events, we got some T-shirts and we bought the summer quilts that we are going to be using for the next big leg of our hike. It was great being able to look at, touch, and test out the equipment from a lot of these cottage company you can normally only look at online. We ate dinner together at the Damascus Brewery and Restaurant. At that point, I said goodbye as Broken Seal and the rest of the family drove to Boone, NC where they have a timeshare right now. I wanted to stay for an amazing lecture by Jennifer Pharr Davis about the new book she just published and was so glad I did. It went until 8:30 so, after a walk around the different music venues, I crawled in the back of Big Mac’s car and settled in for the night.","Sugar Run Gap

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592118,"I had the morning to myself before the family returned to Damascus. I started with the AYCE pancake breakfast with Amazonia and Chumbawumba. Then I went to the foot washing and massage station at one of the churches. I should’ve known what was going to happen but the massages sounded too good to pass up. There were two Baptist women working on my feet. They were really nice but asked a lot of personal questions and made me feel a little uncomfortable. When someone is touching your feet like, it can be kind of an intimate space. I was appreciative of what they were doing for us though and listened to their beliefs. I just think I could have prepared myself better mentally going into that space. 
I got Dad’s tent in for repairs and cruised around Trail Days until the family came. It was great having them there for the Hiker Parade. I couldn’t believe we were in The Hiker Parade; THE Hiker Parade that I have heard about since I was a little girl. I had a moment amidst all the festivities and water guns! We walked down the center of Damascus alongside many of our friends. Lots of dancing started when we returned to the town park. We threw down some of our moves warming up for the upcoming talent show in which we planned to compete. Broken Seal went off to find our family who was holding all of our belongings so they didn’t get wet in the parade.
The next thing you know, I am trying to find some medical help for Broken Seal. He suddenly began to experience extreme lower leg pain and could not walk. His parents had found him and he was in the back seat of their car. Ellen got him fluids and we all stood by waiting for some help to come. They (the EMT and the woman letting us park in her yard) guessed he was having muscle spasms and gave us ice packs to help him. He spent the rest of the afternoon in that backseat while we wrapped up at Trail Days. They started back to Boone before us; we wanted to try our luck at the big raffle of the weekend but we came out empty handed. 
Broken Seal was still in a lot of pain hours later and was understandably getting nervous as to what was going on and what the implications might be for our hike. Ellen tried to comfort him with chicken noodle soup for dinner. He could shuffle around the cabin at that point but it was minimal. We made no decisions about the coming days since we. Wanted to see how he’d be doing in the morning. The benefit to sleeping in the pullout couch was that Broken Seal got to watch an NBA playoff game while I fell asleep","

It was a miraculous turn around from the night before without any lingering soreness. We still decided it would be best to rest for the day. We had plenty of little tasks to keep ourselves busy from patching holes in clothes to prepping our parents for their overnight the next day. We went out to lunch at Southwest/Caribbean restaurant with yummy results. Broken Seal and Ellen bought the team’s food while Big Mac helped me get a new phone. 
We went straight to the resort’s golf course afterwards. Other than sneaking around golf courses and hiding in the sand pits when in elementary school, I’ve never done anything like this before. It was a 9-hole 3 par course and the five of us had so much fun. Broken Seal kept hitting his ball past the green even though he was only using a pitching wedge. Benny was the group instructor who lost a couple balls into some ponds. Big Mac had a couple of good holes and probably took home first place. Ellen and I brought up the rear but definitely had the most fun. It was a full day!","

It was hard leaving the comfort of the cabin, but everyone was really good about getting themselves organized and in the car to leave. Broken Seal and Ellen whipped up some delicious eggs with avocado and toast- very hipster! Benny was pretty adorable as we were leaving. He didn’t realize he only had to pick us up tomorrow, not drop us off too. So he was all dressed and ready to go; instead he got to enjoy the solitude at the cabin. 
On our way to the trailhead, we went to the PO and I picked up an awesome letter from my cousin Laura. It was filled with glitter (like always) and was a true gift to receive! We returned to the point where we skipped ahead at Whitetop Mountain Rd. 
We could see the thunderhead clouds growing as we started and soon it was raining. By raining, I mean capital R-aining!!! Other than the five miles we hiked with Ellen and Big Mac on Wednesday last week, this rain put every other rain storm to shame! Most people would have had soggy moods but our parents really stepped up to the plate and were absolute rockstars! Big Mac has backpacked a lot before and knew how to cope. Still, he pointed out most people would call us crazy with the ankle deep water and thunder clapping around us. Ellen on the other hand has only a little backpacking experience and didn’t let any of the weather or slippery rocks and roots damper her spirits. Honestly, it was impressive!
It was a great feeling to reach the Thomas Knob shelter! There was a crowd there but we had a feeling most people were just lingering and would keep hiking on as it was only 2pm when we arrived. We were the first to set up and claim our floor space on the lower level. We’d been able to keep our gear dry and changed into some of those layers before sitting on the floor to eat the regular tuna burritos. Ellen had yucked the tuna idea when shopping but she wanted the hiker experience and enjoyed the burritos too! Everything tastes better in the woods!
The three of them put dry clothes on while I stubbornly was hanging out in my dry puffy for the upper half and kept all my wet clothes on my lower half. With everyone leaving Trail Days in Damascus, it made good people watching as a variety  of groups passed through the shelter. As the clouds parted later in the day, we hung a bunch of our clothes in the trees branches to give them the opportunity to slightly dry. From behind the shelter, there was a terrific view of Mt. Rogers on our right, a long ridge extending out to the left, and then layers of mountains straight out across the bushy meadow. We spent a lot of time at that view feeling extremely grateful.
Our parents continued to impress us when they finished their whole Knorr Rice Sides with instant mash potatoes. It was washed down with some hot cocoa. After settling down for the night, we were the last people to fit our food and smellies into the temporary bear box. Thank goodness!! It was a close race to la la land between Big Mac and Ellen with Broken Seal and I trailing behind. We are sad tonight is our last night with them but it is inevitable and this not bad way to wrap it up!","Whitetop Mountain Road

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592122,"Day 48 - Thomas Knob Shelter (498.4mi) to Fox Creek (512mi)
We were bright eyed and bushy tailed when the shelter got moving at 6:30. Big Mac was the first one up and reported good views from the behind the shelter. The sun had just began to cut sideways through the trees illuminating the fogged-in valleys way below us. Some green peaks jut out from the cloud carpet and took Ellen’s breathe away. 
As we were packing up, a section hiker came to the picnic table with his Ursac ripped open and completely brown with mud and bear saliva. He found it still completely tied to the tree but the bear had been able to rip the seam of the bag open and then devour all of the food. He was not the only person whose food was taken by the bear either. We found a thruhiker who I will not name moping in his pile of food wrappers alongside the trail. I gave him some bars to eat and helped clean up the mess before the four of us entered the Grayson Highlands State Park aka Mini Pony Land!
Within feet of the boundary fence, there was a baby pony that could only have been a couple of days old. Looking ahead, we could see many more ponies roaming the ridges. What a sight!! The walking was rocky, muddy, and slow going but we were stopping anyway to ooh and ahh at the munching herds, each having a few small calves among them. In addition to the ponies, we also crossed our first trail maintenance crew of the trip. A huge thank you goes out to them for all their hard work!
At a break, we called Benny to give him our ETA down at Fox Creek. Broken Seal went into his email and had received another graduate school acceptance letter from his final school!! We were all so happy for him. Even though he was good at enjoying the accomplishment for a little, Broken Seal went straight into business and planning mode in regards to how he would make his decision. When we met up  to have lunch at the Scales corral after hiking with our respective parents for awhile, Broken Seal had decided he wanted to go back to Boone, NC to use the family laptop for research purposes and that he wanted to make a final decision tonight! It certainly changed the mood of the group for a bit.
From lunch, it was a long but gradual downhill to Fox Creek. Even though the rain had held off so far today, the trail was so wet and muddy. It was a real pain in the butt and our parents got a good peak at how so much more than just distance can determine can determine daily mileage. We knew it was a successful trip when Ellen said that even though she was excited to shower and be in a bed tonight, she knew she would be missing sleeping outside.
The icing on their experiential trip was finding a great trail magic setup by Graybeard at the trailhead where Benny was waiting for us. We indulged in some cold sodas before Benny whisked us back to Big Mac’s car at Whitetop.
We had a slightly teary goodbye like always. Big Mac has always been such a great sport in following me on all of the crazy and challenging adventures I seem to find myself in. He is always pushing his limits so that he share in these experiences with me and it is profoundly appreciated. After two weeks of following our smelly butts around VA, he started the long drive back to NH and we started driving back to NC. I’m pretty sure that there rental car has a lingering stink to it from our wet shoes and socks alone. Benny and I did the resupply shopping together while Broken Seal started in on his grad school research. He definitely had a preferred school but is going to try it on for size mentally before making the official decision.","Thomas Knob Shelter

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592130,"Day 49- It took a lot to roll out of the pull-out couch this morning. Broken Seal had some more computer things he needed to do. Muffins, yoghurt, a Naked juice drink. From where we left off last Friday, our next  chosen resupply is going to be in 100 miles. I knew we would need a lot of food but it feels like I may have over-shopped (oops)! Luckily, we have lightened our base weights by sending some of our extra warm clothes, rain pants, and our warm sleeping bags home.
After blasting out some final emails Broken Seal and I hit the road one final time with his parents. It was a long, fun ride. Feels funny when you can cover over 100 miles in a car in the blink of an eye and yet it takes us almost week. To soften the blow of saying goodbye to his amazing parents, we were fortunate enough to come across the one and only Miss Janet at the trailhead. After taking some photos with her and getting a passport stamp, she jumped back up into her trail angel van and we say goodbye to Broken Seal’s parents. 
Today we felt like we were hiking like we normally do but our total for today barely broke a 2 miles an hour average. Even though it’s hard to leave his parents, we were immediately reminded of why we love being out here once we started hiking. There were good views, the first shelter had an awesome porch, follow that up with the start of the rhododendrons blooming. I’m really excited to see the rhododendron tunnel and it’s full force. 
We lunched at an overlook at a powerline and then kept pushing towards Pearisburg. From the Angels Rest viewpoint, it’s a steep downhill into Pearisburg but we were talking about life’s existential questions and suddenly we were at the first road crossing. We had come across our first dried up water source; it meant we would have to do another 6 miles without water. Knowing us, we can definitely do it, it was nothing to worry about. We walked over the New River across a long bridge. Today we also came across our first non-potible water source along Landfill Road, no surprises there. As we kept hiking past it, there was a lingering smell. 
After we crested a particular ridge, the smell was replaced by the lovely odor of mountain laurel. Even though we’re starting the green tunnel, it’s moments like these that make the trails beauty become apparent in nontraditional ways. Staring contests with cows, Broken Seal spotting our first strawberry today, those kind of things. The AT seems to have traffic far more than just humans from the deer and bear prints we see once in a while to all the snails and millipedes trying to cross the trail as we walk by jumping to avoid smashing them. Or even seeing a large spider with many babies on board. 
After the landfill water, we crossed a stream with a sign telling us it was on private property. There were multiple law-enforcement vehicles that drove by but it wasn’t until we kept hiking that I realized what they were there for but I’ll save that for another post. 
Anyway, the next water sources were not too far off and we ended up pushing until 7:30 to make it to the Ricefield Shelter. As we crested to the top of the ridge, the shelter was set back in the trees with a large, grassy field in front of it. After chatting with the hikers there, we set up our tents on the edge of this grassy field overlooking the valley is below. After attempting to put a dent in our large food pile, we snuggled up in bed reflecting on how it seemed the trail was providing for us. We interpreted the hints of beauty as encouragement in a way to help heal the pain of saying goodbye to the most amazing parents we could’ve ever asked for.","Sugar Run Gap

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593006,"Day 50- Best sunrise of the trail. Hands down! Overnight, the valleys below us had filled with a white carpet of clouds. The sun rose just behind a nearby knob but projected the softest light onto the delicate looking clouds. We were covered in dew but that’s what you get when you sleep without the rainfly on your tent. The hiking was wet too just by brushing up against the tall grasses alongside the trail.
On other hand, there were no water sources for most of the morning. Once we were loaded up with our water and belongings, it was a long, view-less ridge walk. At times, the footing was really rocky but it was gradual and smooth for most of the morning. 
We had to descend midday and we discovered our first wind had dissipated. It was hot and humid lower down and we got frustrated with the nonsensical PUDS once in awhile when we could have just walked alongside the river. Even after lunch, we were still feeling gassed. It was going to be a noteworthy climb back up the next ridge. We were crawling.
Luckily for us, there was a shelter part way up the ascent. We spontaneously decided to stop in and refreshed our spirits with good conversation with the hikers there. A section hiker, Leg, threw us a Snickers bar on the way out and, at that moment, I knew our day was revived. 
The last 6 miles of the day didn’t feel as hard as the last even though the terrain was more difficult. We were aiming for the Wind Rock campsite and it was the best one so far! Two great campsites in a row! This one was grassy with an equally stunning view; layers of ridges lay before without a single building in sight. Broken Seal got to play around in the trees and the bear hang was easy. We watched the colorful sunset together at this campsite we had all to ourselves and then crawled into the tent. It didn’t take much to convince me to watch Mamma Mia with Broken Seal. It was too much fun and we didn’t fall asleep until way past hiker midnight but it was so well worth it! If you had asked me at lunch, I would have never guessed that our day could turn around so drastically for the better.","Rice Field Shelter

The dew fell heavily on us again but e were a bit more dry than the previous morning. Shortly after hiking, Broken Seal pulled over to talk to a man about a horse. I didn’t think much about it until we were separated and I was the one without the toilet tools!! So what did I do? Put ABBA’s Greatest Hits on and speed walk to the next shelter. 
We were feeling good today. Broken Seal had been doing all sorts of mileage math in his head and was optimistic we would be reunited with Wings in the evening if we did well. First we had to get up and over one of the steeper climbs we’ve come across recently. Then we walked through an incredibly stunning series of pastures midday. As we ‘ooh’ed and ‘aah’ed, we also ‘eww’ed because we felt like we were walking through tick heaven! 
I started to get a little melty exposed in the fields so we held off lunching until a very cool waymark in the trees. After crossing a cow herd, we came to Keffer Oak, the largest oak tree in the South at 18’ around. At 300 years old, it’s older than the USA and was a great, contemplative spot to rest and eat. Another steep climb to our final ridge walk of the day. There were rock piles along the first half of the grassy ridge; it then turned narrow and slabby. We started catching hikers and they passed their nervousness about going over Dragon Tooth’s in the rain tomorrow. It was not something we had put much thought to so we spent some trail time making some decisions about the next day as we pushed to finish up at Niday Shelter. There was still some room in the shelter luckily and everyone who was there already was really friendly Broken Seal had a small sip of only his second hard liquor of the thruhike before joining me stretching in the shelter and then in Z-z-z land.","Wind Rock Campsite

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592132,"The subconscious is powerful. It knew we were supposed to wake up early and therefore we kept awaking up all night. We  were still feeling very energetic when we hit the trail at 5am!! I took the spider web duty first so Broken Seal could eat his honey buns in peace. The hiking was enjoyable and it was fun watching the dawn set in as we climbed! The terrain was flowy and we moved consistently as the morning hours went by. 
Since we knew the rain was coming, it helped motivate us up and over all of the false ridges to the overlook on Cove Mountain. It took longer than expected but was so rewarding. The Dragon Tooth’s side trail was not too far from the summit. Being the Saturday on Memorial Day weekend, there were a lot of day hikers hanging out. It was possible to scramble to the top of the “tooth” so we waited our turn to stand at the tippy top; some guy’s watch told him it would rain in 19 minutes. The panoramic view from the top as incredible! I didn’t plan accordingly and had to warn the small crowd below to avert their eyes as I climbed down in my skirt. We were able to get through the tricky part of the descent before the skies opened up; we timed it perfectly! I used the opportunity to take a natural shower as we walked to the Four Pines Hostel. 
I looked like a cat that went for a swim by the time we walked in. We stood dripping in the garage before we decided to stay! It was just like the Dinsmore’s on the PCT. There was one bunk left with our name on it and an all you can eat buffet down the road. We were reunited with Wings and saw U-Turn too which were both such a delight. The buffet at The Homeplace was indeed delicious with good home-cooked southern food. We got a ride with Odie from the Hiker Yearbook in his school-bus back to hostel where I laid low and enjoyed the fireflies until sleep took over.","Niday Shelter

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593013,"Day 53- When I woke up, the seven bunk beds were mostly full along with around five people draped across the couches too. I tiptoed outside of the garage/hostel to get some fresh air and start packing up. A few people had already risen and were doing the same. Wings came up to me from his tent and offered to help us slackpack. His girlfriend was going to catch a ride to Daleville and it would be easy for her to bring an extra backpack along. Broken Seal was still asleep but I had a feeling he would go for it, especially because it would mean being with Wings. 
We jumped on the trail feeling light and fresh with our almost empty backpacks. It didn’t take long for someone to propose jogging and then we were off! They were kind enough to wait for me at the parking lot for McAfee Knob and we waded through the crowds on that short section of trail together. 
If I am being super honest, McAfee Knob was a disappointment for me personally. I can also acknowledge that it is completely my own fault. This is the first time that it has bit me in the butt knowing and seeing pictures of these places since I was a little kid. Wings says it is called Paris Syndrome. If it weren’t for that particular photo angle, it would look like many other section of ledges. We still messed around taking a bunch of fun photos before pushing onto Tinker Cliffs.
Hindsight is 20-20 and we probably could have headed out of Four Pines earlier today. The fact is that we didn’t and we got caught in a lightning storm. We had been hauling booty hoping to get up and across the cliffs before the storm got close. I had gotten ahead of the boys when they stopped to fill up on water and I was definitely getting nervous as the booms got louder and closer. I even tried to call Broken Seal to check in on where their heads were at. 
As I put the phone, the largest black snake I have seen so far was stretched in a perfect line straight across the trail in front of me. I stopped dead in my tracks ; I wasn’t going to try and step over the thing. It took more than the normal amount of nudges to get this snake to start moving. It hit me, looking down at this big black snake impeding me from going forward, that this was a sign that I was supposed to stop. Immediately, I turned southward and hiked down back down the trail to wait for my two friends.
They found me not too much later getting shelter under a thick tree. Together we hiked until we found this great rock overhang where we lunched until the storm had passed. Other people had hiked through it but I doubt they got the great views we did. I was super glad we had played it safe and waited it out; we were rewarded with having the whole place to ourselves!
Wings raced ahead to be with his waiting girlfriend, we assessed each others’ heat rashes that recently appeared, and then hiked the rest of the way to Daleville with our friends Metric and Rooster aka U-Turn. They went to the Howard Johnson’s and I followed looking unsuccessfully for a couple we are trying to catch, Dandelion and Springbok. 
Wings was all showered up by the time we made it to the room. We followed suit and soon walked under the interstate to the really cute Angelles Diner. After a great meal and ice cream sundaes at Mickey D’s. We all fell asleep in the room before the NBA game was over (except for Broken Seal who is really into it).","Four Pines Hostel

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593015,"Day 54- I made myself comfortable at the breakfast buffet downstairs while everyone else slept in. The first wave was normal guests; the second wave was all thruhikers including Pappy, the oldest triple crowner and now attempting to be the oldest AT thruhiker at 87!! The thing he wish he knew when he was in his 20’s: how to train for marathons better. 
Our morning was spent delaying the inevitable with tasks requiring wifi like paying bills and updating the journal.
We didn’t get hiking until after 11. Today was overcast keeping the temperatures somewhat tolerable but the humidity still kills me and our skin. After a couple of road crossings we started traveling through scenic mountain laurel tunnels.
There has been so much rain recently that everything and more is flowing. We took our shoes and socks off twice to cross streams. There were also a couple of fresh trees down across the trail making for some fun navigating. 
We passed a shelter where we assumed most people we leap frogged with today are stopping at. The trail was empty after that except for a guy in a tent (we assume video chatting someone) who said in a very enthusiastic voice, “Wow! That was a big bite!” right as we walked by. It was moments like this that cheered us up a bit. Today was the first day that felt like work and it seemed like the forest knew it by how quiet and still everything was (except fo the streams). It would have been fun to spend the day with Wings and his girlfriend in Roanoke but it was an unspoken agreement that we would be hiking today instead. 
Once the clock hit 6:30pm, we ended our day at the first established camp spot we found. We lovingly bickered as we let our skin try and dry out. Then chowed on some Knorr fried rice before konking out.","Daleville

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593018,"Day 55- As great as hotel rooms can be, I always sleep better outside. Today we slept in and it was marvelous! We didn’t start hiking until 8:30. Instead of doing our normal thing , we both started listening to an audiobook together. Broken Seal pulled over at the first shelter to use the privy and we didn’t see each other again until lunch. It’s the longest time we have hiked separately before. 
I was absorbed mentally by the book and the hiking part just came naturally. When it was getting to be about chow time, I came across a great swim hole with a little beach under the bridge the trail crosses. I booted it down to the shore, took my clothes off, and waded in before diving into the center of the moving river. It was majestic and I had the whole place to myself. Standing in the deep cold water, I just soaked my surroundings in.
I was shaken out of my bliss by the sound of car doors closing. I was joined by a sweet, local couple and soon Broken Seal showed up too.
After Broken Seal took more of a bathe then a swim, we chatted over lunch about how the hiking had not come as easy to him. He just couldn’t find his right gear and that was a sentiment he would carry for the rest of the day unfortunately. From the swim hole, it was going to be a lot of climbing to our final destination. We hiked together the rest of the way. The forest had changed from a bushy and rocky undergrowth to a beautiful green, leafy carpet with the trees well-spaced apart shooting up from the floor.
It felt good to arrive at the shelter especially because there was a couple there, Springbok and Dandelion, we had been hoping to catch. After good chats, we crawled into the tent. I fell asleep while watching an architecture show Broken Seal had downloaded for me- what a sweetie.","Near BRP (Mi. 745)

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593019,"Day 56- We were weenies today. It had rained all night and was raining when I woke up. Instead of encouraging Broken Seal awake, I kept telling him to go back to sleep and he did. Today was the kind of day when I wish we could just lounge around inside a small cabin with a wood fire and cup of tea wearing sweaters. Instead we got up and hiked, just not until 9 am. Most people had gotten a head start on us and we only saw two people on trail the whole day.
The end of the climb up Apple Orchard Mountain was steep and engulfed in clouds. Broken Seal’s feet were hurting from the day before and the long descent to the road from the summit really tested him. The main thing that would cheer him up was spotting little orange salamanders in the trail. I knew each time he found one because he would start talking in a high pitch voice and remove it from the trail. 
My favorite part of the day was walking through the craziest rhododendron tunnels! After not seeing any rhododendrons for a couple days, we were walking through beautiful pink and purple flowers. The mountain laurels were stunning as well.
We were not paying too much attention to the weather until it started to swing wildly from sunny to torrential downpour every ten minutes. After the fifth dousing, I didn’t care what the weather was as long as it made up its mind!! The back and forth was driving me mad; I would’ve even chosen the rain over this. It became a little too much for Broken Seal but we were saved as the sun cleared enough for us to cross the longest footbridge on the trail and hitch a ride into Glasgow, VA with above local man returning from his son’s baseball game.
Glasgow is this tiny town that does a lot to have hikers come. Right downtown, they’ve built a large shelter with electricity (even a microwave), trash, picnic tables, drying lines, port-a-johns, and even a hot shower with soaps. It was above and beyond I feel and could easily see getting stuck there. 
I should’ve known based on the social scene we found there when we arrived that it was not going to be a quiet night. We ignored that little voice, took the last two bunks, and set our things out to dry before going to get pizza at the only restaurant in town, Scotto’s. We each got our own large pizza and then did our resupply at the super quirky local grocery. Once back in the town’s shelter, we had to lay in our bunks with a boisterous party going on until someone finally said something to the group after 10pm.","Cornelius Creek Shelter

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593023,"Day 57- I went to bed cranky and I woke up cranky. The shelter was a total mess and the things on the drying lines ended up more wet than they started. Everyone was still asleep so I went alone to the gas station to get a hot breakfast of microwave Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches. Employees were sitting at the only table in the place so I sat on the curb outside. It took us much longer to get out of this place than I would’ve liked but we finally got a ride in the back of a van by a ranting conservative who also gave us all of the Sasquatch spotting tips. 
Today was a big up to the top of Bluff Mountain followed by an equally big down the other side followed by a long flat. We decided to climb separately and we both got into the same audiobook. When we met up to lunch on leftover pizza, we compared our hypothesis as to what would happen next. It helped us stay steady with our pace and do the climb without having to stop and catch our breath.
We took an audiobook break on the descent to enjoy the full blown flower fest the trail was having with blossoming rhododendrons and mountain laurel all mixed together. With all the recent rain, a colorful carpet of flowers had begun to form under the plants too. It was the highlight of the day! Everything got tougher from there.
I got my first real blister; it was from the pilling on a new pair of Smartwool socks. Then we heard the thunder start rumbling and soon we had the hardest rain of the trip. We had to yell to communicate because of how loud it was! We were soaked. It was only a couple of miles to the shelter when the rain subsided.  In that time, my heat rash exploded to new levels of pain. 
Today was a trying day for me but I was fortunate to have Broken Seal to help me out. He lathered me in baby powder and took charge in getting us set up in the shelter. There were nice people there including an old friend, Grasshopper. After some food, hot chocolate, and a firefly show, we closed the pages on today’s saga. Tomorrow will be better!","Glasgow, VA

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593105,"Day 59- We had aspirations to get up and watch the sunrise from Spy Rock but I think the alarm scared both of us from deep dreaming when it went off. The quick and unanimous decision was to just wake up naturally today and we got moving about 7:45.  The day started by reaching the top of The Priest (mountain) and then descending almost 3000 feet down before having to climb 3000 feet back up Three Ridges Peak. The whole morning we were surrounded in clouds with a light breeze. It was helping keep the temperature down and preventing us from sweating too much. We debated evolution and astrophysics before I started to get breathy and our conversation soon dissipated as we got farther into the climb. 
We were faced with our first dilemma today in regards to some of our thruhiking principles. We knew weather was coming but it wasn’t there yet when we were presented with a side trail that would be 3 to 4 miles shorter and would also go around the peak instead of climbing to the summit. We decided to stick to the AT; we could always come back if needed in regards to risk management. 
At the next shelter, we met up with a trail family that we really enjoyed spending time with back at Woods Hole. After the normal banter, we brought up the side trail and one of them let us know that there is actually an amazingly gorgeous and very tall waterfall, one of the biggest on the East Coast, on the side trail. We had started asking ourselves what would we be missing if we had gotten off the AT and here is a prime example where maybe choosing the AT was not always the best choice. We were definitely conflicted but had committed to the climb. 
The rain started as we got close to halfway with distant thunder not soon after. As much as I wanted to spend time with this new group of people, my preference was to get up and down the other side of this thing before I felt uncomfortable like I had at Tinker Cliffs. The lightning never showed up close to us and the rain stayed heavy for the final miles to Reed’s gap where we planned to end the day. Since Georgia, we’ve been hearing about this great brewery and were fortunate to have the end of our day naturally line up with the road crossing. 
It was a tough hitch down to the Devil’s Backbone Brewery Basecamp. What a treat it was!
For being such an upscale, almost bougie, brewery, they treated us like we were VIP members. The quality of their staff and their facility is exceptional and the fact that we were treated with such kindness and generosity was astounding. In addition to free camping and a free ride back to trail in the morning, on this special day we got free entry to a music festival they were hosting. With our hiker tags in hand, we got our wristbands and got to indulge in beer tasting from six local breweries, dance to local music, and finish the night off in the complementary Smore makings station. And in the mist of all this, another thruhiker had family visiting. Mama Gump, Auntie Gump, and Uncle Gump treated us to an incredible dinner at the restaurant. Between the Gump family and the Devil’s Backbone family, we felt so supported, so welcome, and we were so happy especially after a couple of hard days.
For friends and family reading this, most of you know that Broken Seal and I met dancing. With all the traveling we’ve been doing, it’s been a long time since we’ve gone dancing but I must say, he still got it!","Spy Rock

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593106,"Day 60- Can you say, “I awoke...” if you were up all night? From some loud party people in the campground to the heaviest nighttime rain, it was a restless night. Even before leaving the tent, we could see our shelter was covered in spiders! It would have been a lot harder to get up if we didn’t have a hiker breakfast awaiting us and the  knowledge that we would be in a room that night. It was still hard. In addition to the tent, there were bugs (and mud!) all over our packs, and self! We enjoyed the generous (and secret) hiker breakfast offered by Devil’s Backbone Basecamp, and grabbed some shwag before getting shuttled back to the trail. 
The trail was in a cloud all day so we moved swiftly, ignoring all potential views, just trying to get to town. We were so excited for town clothes and food! We ended up linking with another young couple, NinjaSnail and Sandals, for the whole hike to Rockfish Gap. 
With all of this rain, the trail was an absolute river at some points. There were a couple of water crossings that I bet only exist a few days of every year. At one point, we all needed to look around for a blaze because we thought we might have just walked up a river bed instead of the trail. We heard a big tree fall in the forest nearby and got a better poison ivy briefing from them. We also learned from a day hiker that Broken Seal‘s favorite little lizards are actually Eastern Red-Spotted Newts.
We got picked up by Stanimal and brought back to his hostel in a zippy shuttle ride. The first thing we did was shower and jump into the loaner close before gathering a crew to go to Mings garden, a trail famous Chinese buffet! When we walked in the door I knew we were in the right place because of the decorative bridge they have over a cold he pond. The islands of food or mouthwatering and I got about five plates sampling all of the different options before I had to round out the meal with two dessert plates. The cherry on the buffet cake though was that wings caught up to us and met us at the buffet. He had done 125 miles in the last four days to be reunited with Broken Seal. In addition to many hikers, there were lots of locals enjoying the place too which is always a good sign. 
We were exhausted from the food and from the relief of being in Waynesboro. The only thing I had to do before going to bed was to enjoy a session in the massage chair.","Reed’s Gap

After sleeping in, we indulged in the local, farm eggs someone had delivered to the hostel for thruhikers. Then we jumped right on the list for today. Food planning and buying, catching up on the journal, a post office run, buying new socks at the outfitters, cleaning our tent, finally getting permethrin on our shoes and gators. There are all little task but they end up taking up most of the day. While I got to spend some afternoon hours at the hostel with my feet up working on the journal, Broken Seal and Wings had their own epic journey to a local Walmart to do the food shopping and buy some personal items. We lunched at a fast food place called the cookout and the guys made egg fried rice for dinner. Then it was off to bed for us!","Rockfish Gap (Waynesboro)

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595105,"Day 65- It was only 4 miles to get to breakfast at a restaurant so we were up and moving pretty efficiently. Broken Seal had to go dig a cathole and Wings pulled off at the first shelter so I had the first hour to hike in solitude. The trail was not too rocky though so they caught up pretty quickly and then ran ahead to the restaurant. 
It feels funny walking up to these nice, clean buildings feeling dirty and smelly but those feelings of self-consciousness are forgotten once the breakfast buffet was in front of us!! Coffee and juice, omelettes made to order, pancakes, fruit salad, baked goods, it was extraordinary
The rest of the day we stuck together joking around, singing songs. We saw two bears and hung out a little bit to admire the second one as it rummaged on the forest floor. In the park, the bears do not seem phased by humans at all. Almost more interesting was the people-watching and the commentary we overheard day and section hikers make to each other. My favorite was the husband who was absolutely adamant that they were going to correct way back to the car. They weren’t. But the husband didn’t want to hear it and had already hiked off and out of sight. I wouldn’t want to be them. 
Once we made it to Thorton Gap,  we easily hitched into Luray, Virginia in the back of a pick up. Luray is very cute, little town and Wings and I had packages to pick up (hooray!). We chose to resupply at Shoppers Value with an aisle where everything is only $.88! We definitely got way too much, it was fun anyway. 
We had to walk to Open Arms Hostel to get a shuttle back up to the trail. It was there we met Allison, really great individual who is obviously doing a lot to provide for hikers; she encouraged us to make the most of her hiker box and trail magic that someone had left. Suddenly our big food bag got even bigger.
We were kind of moaning and groaning as we hiked less than 2 miles to the Pass Mountain Hut. We could’ve made it farther  but the idea of having a bear to store all this food sounded smart based on how many bears we’d seen. It was a nice crew there and we indulged in some beers we had carried up. We went to bed happy!","Franklin Cliffs

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595106,"Day 66- Other than a mice eating something, I woke up to birdsong. Within five minutes of hiking, a bear and I surprised each other. It scurried a little farther away and then stood watching me as I slowly kept walking by. My adrenaline was up but I just wasn’t feeling like pushing it today. I think I would’ve put my headphones in today if we weren’t in the national park.
We had an early early lunch at the Elkwallow Wayside just trying to quench my increasing hunger. Soon it was pretty clear I would be feeling lazy all day. Not tired or bored, but just not wanting to huff and puff up every hill or flit down every descent. I’d get there when I would get there.
Broken Seal stayed by my side for most of the afternoon and had some more life talks about our upcoming fall. Leaving the park was uneventful. We made it to the Tom Floyd Shelter in time to set our tent up before a brief but heavy rainfall. The shelter was full with section hikers about to enter the park. They were all excited but it translated into being kind of loud. After finishing the heavy gnocchi, we went to bed. There’s a lot of exciting stuff ahead like passing the 1,000 miles mark, reaching Harper’s Ferry, attempting the Four State Challenege, but mostly my mama will be coming to help us out on Tuesday!

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595104,"Day 67- I woke up dancing. The alarm this morning was another ABBA song, something about “the winner takes it all”. The tent had dried overnight and it didn’t take too long to start the day. There were 3 shelters today all spaced only 4-6 miles from each other with a final fourth one 8+ miles from the third. I would push out first from each, then Wings would catch me, followed by Broken Seal.
The first cool thing we passed was the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute property; the chain link fences were overgrown with sweet smelling honeysuckle. I think the time frame that some of these flowers are blooming for feels extended because we are hiking north following the blooming of spring.
Then we hit the Jim & Molly Denton Shelter which was our first shelter with a horseshoe setup OR with a solar shower!! Plus it was clean with nice deck chairs for the nice porch. It was hard walking away from that place. 
Five-ish miles later we lunched at Manassas Gap Shelter. They caught up to me right as I turned down the side trail to it and they let me know they had looked at the forecast. The rain today was supposed to start at 3pm with lightning and overnight it was falling for 1-2 inches of additional rain. Suddenly only going as far as the next (third) Shelter sounded nice instead of pushing. A southbounder confirmed our fears about a lot of hikers between the third and fourth shelter so we decided to cut the day short. It was a bit tricky because I felt like I was hiking really well today but a miserable night with little sleep didn’t sound too nice either.
The third shelter, Dick’s Dome was a small hexagonal shelter right by a creek. It was actually kind of sweet and we would’ve set up camp right away except we saw a paper note written about a cool shelter nearby. It took only a little exploring to find a brand new shelter only 200 feet away. It was a large, two-story shelter with a good size covered porch. We immediately backtracked to bring our packs to this new shelter instead. It was so new that there was absolutely no graffiti yet- how cool!
Our hiking day was over by 3:30 at the latest but it gave us an afternoon to relax and eat food. Two days ago, I thought we packed too much. Our hunger has been next level though and we are demolishing everything edible. Our hunger is so strong that we allowed ourselves to eat extra food knowing that tomorrow we can go to Bear’s Den, an ATC run hostel, to pick up more food. It seems that I have upped the ante and blown through very thruhiker hunger threshold with time. 
By the end of the night, there were less than 10 of us in this new shelter and everyone was in bed by eight. That is except for the fireflies. They were having a fiesta as we fell asleep!","Tom Floyd Shelter

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595996,"Day 68-  We slept so well. The sound of the rain all night. No evidence of mice scurrying around us. It’s hard getting up and out when it’s raining. It’s really hard putting wet socks and shoes on. The forecast was  not looking good for today so we told Wings to just go ahead to the Bears Den Hostel; it probably wouldn’t be too fun for him to have to wait up for us in the rain. So that meant it was just Broken Seal and I.
We knew we had the infamous roller coaster coming up which is 13 miles of tightly packed ascents and descents so we decided today would be an audiobook day. We chose our next novel which is on North Korea to entertain us through the miles. Luckily, it wasn’t actually raining too hard, it was more of a mist, but of course the plants still got us soaking wet. 
I liked the sign that welcomed us to the roller coaster telling us to “enjoy the ride”! And what a ride it was! It was pretty rocky which helped keep us from going too fast on uphills and also kept us from flying on the townhouse. 
The roller coaster was full of surprises. The first of which was lovely trail magic by parents visiting their kids who were thruhiking. Hot dogs, Gatorade, cookies, fruit; it was much needed and went down easily even after we had just had our own lunch. 
The second moment was crossing the thousand mile marker!! Woo hoo! One thousand miles. While this isn’t the first time I’ve walked 1000 miles, it’s definitely the first time Broken Seal has. I think at first he was at a loss for words still processing his amazing accomplishment. I couldn’t get much out of him other than “this is pretty awesome” and “it’s super cool”. 
As the accomplishment really set in, we had a great conversation about what it meant to walk 1000 miles to us, what it meant for the rest of our hike, and the implications that could be on the future. Once you have walked 1000 miles, other great notions can seem much more feasible. One of the things I really liked that Broken Seal said more specific to our thruhike is that crossing 1000 miles, and especially once we’ve hit the unofficial (Harpers Ferry) and official halfway point, will be like a seesaw. So far, we have focused all of our energy on making it here and now the seesaw has tipped towards the other direction and we’re going to be working towards the end. Psychologically, it will be really interesting to see how we frame our hike going forward. 
Understandably, we are absolutely relieved that we are soon going to be done with Virginia, which alone is 25% of the whole thruhike. Now that the mileage in the northern states are significantly shorter, I think that will help in feeling like we are constantly chipping away at and getting closer to Katahdin. We called our parents because we were excited and I think they were happy to share that moment with us.
We still had some miles to go and as we approach the Bear’s Den Hostel, my legs started feeling the effects of the roller coaster. We didn’t get there until around 4:00. Wings had been there since 1:30 just to give you a frame of reference on how fast he is. Seemed like a really cool place but we decided pretty quickly it was not where we wanted to stay for the night. We decided we wanted to push 7 more miles to the Blackburn AT Center. After the nice break at Bears Den, I felt like I had it in me to finish the ride and then coast to Blackburn. 
I told Wings and Broken Seal to go ahead. Before we split it off, we had one final encounter with a hiker who thought that Broken Seal and I were siblings. It’s becoming a common occurrence and we think it’s pretty weird.
This was the first time on the trail I’ve hiked late making it to Blackburn just before 8 PM. I secured a sleeping spot on a nice bench within their screened porch. The Blackburn AT Center is somewhere we’ve been told to go to since before the trail because Broken Seal’s Mom is close to Ruth Blackburn‘s granddaughter. We took photos and the caretaker gave us a tour around the property. I was exhausted though and I think Broken Seal was too even though he kept good face by staying up to learn more about the place for his mom’s friend. We demolished the final dinner foods in our bag and all curled up in our appropriate spots scattered across the porch.","Dick’s Dome/ Whiskey Hollow Shelter

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597092,"Day 69- It had been chilly morning and I saw it was completely fogged in when I pulled the buff from over my eyes. I went and crawled onto Broken Seal just waking up on a couch nearby to mobilized for a quick 12 miles into Harpers Ferry! Other than the honey buns for this morning and a couple snack bars to get us there, the only thing left in our food bag was one extra Knorrs Rice Side. While we are proud to have calculated our food ration very accurately, it did not go without some stress. We have been hungry this whole section; I really feel like a bottomless pit.
 I headed out first, making a little more headway on our North Korean novel and crossing many section hikers just like we’ve been doing for last couple days it seems. One guy said I looked fresh and I chuckled to myself because my last shower was in Waynesboro before the Shenandoah. My guess is that he just saw my energy and excitement about reaching this point today.
We walked above the Shenandoah River together, climbed up into the town of Harper’s Ferry, crossed the old Storer College campus, and walked hand in hand into the Appalachian Trail Conservancy HQ! Got our halfway mark hiker numbers which were 723 and 724… Just a reminder our Amicalola hiker numbers were 1949 and 1950. We flipped through the log of the hikers who have come before us this year and definitely recognized some faces. Most of them we didn’t recognize, even people who had checked in on the same day. 
Elation doesn’t even begin to cover how I felt being there, hanging out in the hiker lounge. We went to an Italian place, Mena’s, for lunch and then headed to the jotel where the much anticipated arrival of Mama Mac would be happening later that afternoon.
As we were walking through town, a guy at the farmers market warned us that we would soon be in Yankee turf and to hide any ‘heat’ we were maybe packing. It was bizarre to me and wondered if the Mason-Dixon Line was more legit than I realized.
Our first priority was laundry and itdidn’t take me long to lock us out of the hotel room wearing nothing but our puffies and a towel; really it was just an excuse to steal more cookies from the front desk platter. 
Before Mom came, a thruhiking buddy of ours named Midlife came to the hotel with his dad to say goodbye. His original plan was to go to Maine but he missed his kids a lot and he was happy to reach Harpers Ferry. He took his dad ‘s visit as a sign and opportunity to get home easier. It was bittersweet and I can see a lot more people choosing to end here.
The real star of the evening for me was Mama Mac coming. I was glad she was content to eat at the restaurant in the hotel. It’s so nice seeing someone is just as happy to see you as you are to see them. Also, we knew it was going to be crucial and helpful to have her assisting us on the Four State Challenge tomorrow. So after dinner with the three of us and a little time reorganizing, she drove us back to the Virginia/West Virginia border crossing where we would set up camp and then head out really early for our attempt.","Blackburn AT Center

I woke up right as the hot breakfast served by the hotel was opened and I found my seat for the next couple of hours eating and chatting with Mama Mac and Broken Seal. His entire legs were still covered in heat rash but he had recovered his energy. My feet ached and going up a flight of stairs was a challenge but I was doing fine otherwise. 
After laying in bed for a couple more hours, Mama Mac and I returned to the ATC to look up past thruhiker friends of ours. Being back in Harper’s Ferry gave us an opportunity to explore the historic downtown a little more and cross the Potomac in the daylight. Upon returning to the hotel, I flopped onto the bed face down and horizontally. Mama Mac rubbed my feet with lotion and wheeled a chair over to support my feet. I took a nap in that exact position, purse still on and all.

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597307,"Day 72- I feel even more tired than I did yesterday! Thank goodness we get to slackpack today! Eating my body weight at the hotel’s breakfast didn’t help with the tiredness. Mama Mac is being terrifically patient with our sleepy butts. 
We didn’t start our slackpack until 11:30.
Unfortunately, it only took a couple of minutes for Broken Seal’s calves to cramp up. Based on the shape he was in when we crossed the border originally and how his body is reacting now, Pennsylvania may not be our best state.
After a long break and some very slow walking, we finally made some progress. We were fortunate that there were no major obstacles planned for today, just mellow walking. There were little creeks we passed and old shelters. We didn’t cross paths with any thruhikers today so we played podcasts over the speaker and listened while we moved. 
Today was a workday. We did not want to be hiking. Its days like today that I think set apart thruhikers from giant section hikers. It takes a lot of determination and mental strength to keep going even when you’re not feeling it.
We thought we had chosen a great pick up point for Mama Mac, but construction closed some roads and her Garmin sent her bizarre ways to try and find us. There is only so much we could do from the trail other than to call off her efforts. Instead, she would meet us in Fayetteville and we would hitch ourselves there.
It was by far our most awkward hitchhiking experience. This road had traffic moving but at 10 minute intervals around the construction work. That meant there was a long line of cars parked waiting for their turn to pass. We were there uncomfortably walking down the line of stopped cars with our thumbs out. A nice family ended our social suffering and let us hop in with them to town where they dropped us off at the most delicious Italian restaurant.
Between Broken Seal’s physical struggles, and Mama Mac’s transportation challenges, we were a little frazzled when we sat in the booth. A couple with four young kids politely chatted us up explaining to their children what the Appalachian Trail was. I think they heard overheard us venting about the day because after they left, the manager told us they had covered our entire bill. Of course, my eyes immediately teared up. It was so unexpected and so generous,; I was just overwhelmed!
The food was mouthwatering and came large portions. We took to go containers to be able to eat this amazing food for dinner tomorrow night and we left a note for that local family expressing our gratitude.
Mama Mac found a great hotel closer to Carlisle that also had cookies at the front desk. I grabbed a handful on the way to our room where we quickly flopped into bed. I’m really grateful having Mom here because I can see this section being even more challenging without her support right now.","Mason-Dixon Line

There is no construction going on this morning so it was a lot easier to get to the starting point for our day then it had been to collect us the night before. This is, of course, after we feasted at my favorite hotel breakfast yet! It would be shorter for me to list the things that I did not eat then the things that I did eat.
It was a beautiful Saturday and it didn’t take long before we could tell a lot of people were out on the trails. Thruhikers, section hikers, day hikers – we saw them all within the first half hour. 
Our biggest climb today was out the gate and once that was over it was relatively flat and easy the entire day. It feels really weird to me that I actually miss some of the more drastic elevation changes just because of how it tends to break up the day. There were multiple times today that it was hard to have a real sense of where I was.
For the first time in a while, there was little cell service and that is just one factor out of a few that made it really challenging for Mama Mac to connect with us at the halfway mark. After some perseverance, she did make it and celebrated reaching that point with a fabulous lunch spread. She is definitely spoiling us silly. I think her epic saga trying to reach that point wiped her out and she return to the hotel to take a nap while we crushed out some more miles. We had bigger plans but we hit the ice cream store at the Pine Grove Furnace State Park at around five and decided to call it.
We cruised the historic downtown of Carlisle and ate the heavenly leftovers from the Italian restaurant the night before. We were all wiped and the beds were really, really soft. An additional shout out goes to Mama Mac for stitching up some of the holes in my clothing – thanks! Extra thanks!","US-30

I think we were the weirdos at the breakfast buffet at this hotel. Wearing our dirty girl gaiters, toe socks, and flip-flops is far from the most stylish thing. People had already started swimming at the state park when we arrived at 8:30 to commence hiking.
Walking in the park was nice because the trail was wide and we could walk next to each other. Once we left the park and we’re on the singletrack AT, we just put her heads down and got the miles done. We didn’t stop moving until Mom met us in her air-conditioned car with lunch. Nothing better than some cold Gatorade with a deli sandwich and chips. 
Today, it was more of a green tunnel with a lot of tall mountain laurel plants hugging the trail. After lunch though we did get some rocky / bouldery sections that were referred to as “rock mazes” in AWOLs guide. Then it went back to the same terrain. It was hot enough that we appreciated the tree cover and we moved fast enough due to slack packing to create a little bit of our own breeze.
Right before we hit boiling Springs, the elevation for profile flatlined. The second we left the trees, it was purifier land. Exposed but beautiful. When we walked through the town of Boiling Springs and passed the ATC Mid-Atlantic headquarters, we just happen to be lucky enough to walk through while they were hosting a music festival! It was right on the lake in town with good bluegrass music and some hard cider and hotdogs stands.
We figured out that if we can average 18 miles a day from now on we will reach kids had in the middle of August. While we had hoped to do more miles today, we had at least hit that average making it easier to say yes to the unexpected event we found ourselves that. We had planned on doing four, flat miles still but we decided to seize the opportunity and Mama Mac drove to boiling Springs to enjoy the music with us.
We people-watched, we danced, we laughed, and we enjoyed ourselves. For the first time ever, we saw a real washboard player. Things were winding down at about seven so we grabbed some food on the way back to the hotel where we jumped straight into the Jacuzzi. What a fun day for all!","Pine Grove Furnace State Park

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595107,"Day 75- So far this week, the plan has changed everyday! Broken Seal had a horrible headache in the night so we let him sleep in instead of getting an early start. We used this opportunity to get me new shoes!! The local store didn’t have my size in the Brooks Cascadias so it was super super helpful having Mama Mac there and able to drive me to there other store a half hour away. The newer versions (the 13s) are sweet but it was hard saying goodbye to the original pair I started with. Most people would have replaced their shoes after 500 miles but mine never had any problems until a little over a week ago. A tiny hole on the inside of front of the shoe was suddenly large enough to put a quarter through. But for about 1,300 miles of life- that is really good!
We picked Broken Seal up and did a resupply shop then got our things out of the hotel. Mama Mac had us back on the trail at 1:30. It was so flat though that we flew. We were averaging over 3 mph. The majority of the day was walking through farmland. There was a heat advisory for today but we managed. We had over 16 miles done by 6:45. We got Asian takeout to go hang out at the new hotel and enjoy our last night together. We got our final showers in and packed our backpacks. While we are eager to get back to our routine, it will be hard seeing Mama Mac go.","Boiling Springs

It is most obvious we have been spoiled when we start hiking with our packs again. After a great week, we said goodbye to the best trail mama ever and got back to the grind. We felt like zombies walking: slow, steady, but mindless. I think PA is going to continue being a challenge because the terrain is very monotonous. It’s pretty and all but there is not a ton of variety to keep me stimulated. We were quick to put our audiobook on (also because it is starting to get good.
At around lunchtime, we hit the road for Duncannon where we indulged in some ice cream! Since we didn’t need anything here, we didn’t realize we would be walking through the entire town. It was the longest road walk in the prime heat of the day! We got to check out the local neighborhood, cross a bridge with turtles down below, and then walk alongside another highway ridge over the Susquehanna.
The trail had us climb back up onto a long ridge. Long story short, our zombie-like pace resulted in us hiking later than usual. We finally pulled into Peter Mountain Shelter at 7:30 where there were some tramilies cooking dinner. Even with all of the people, it quieted down early. I think I’m still struggling with keeping up with my electrolyte intake based on the extreme amount I’ve been sweating so it took awhile for me to fall asleep due to a tough headache.

We both slept in and didn’t start hiking until 8:30. Luckily, today was not going to be as steamy so we weren’t bummed about missing some prime hiking weather. Honestly, today was not a stellar day; I’m just happy I had Broken Seal to keep my spirits up.
The swimming hole we had heard about was not appealing. We tried to finish our audiobook today. After 17 hours, the last twenty minutes or so was scratched so we missed the end. I started to get a headache before lunch time. Plus the water sources were either slim or slightly brown. It was all adding up to be pretty frustrating. Broken Seal tried to keep me cheerful. For only the second time of the hike, we put music on to jam it while hiking. It was amazing how much it helped. 
Right as we approached 20 miles for the day, we hit the most flooded part of trail we’ve seen yet! Broken Seal’s feet slipped and he ended up in the stagnant water. I fought it and after 15 minutes or so still ended up with damp feet. It was really buggy though so we climbed up and over Second Mountain until we found a tent spot. We had Wing’s favorite dinner of couscous and then crawled into the tent. Some days are just work. This was one of them.","Peter Mountain Shelter

The trend finally appeared! Our two tough days back on the trail where followed by a day so fabulous that we could not have even guessed it!
First, it was the Summer Solstice aka Naked Hiker Day! It was cool and drizzly when we woke up, not ideal nudey weather. Instead of being brave, badass hikers, we stayed in the tent catching up on writing and the World Cup. We had a series of road crossings in the morning so we started clothed. It all came off late morning when the sun came out and we were all alone. 
Before that could happen we got to indulge in some great trail magic by two 2017 thruhikers: Rocket Man and Mr. T. They had hard boiled eggs, fruit, beverages and chairs set out in front of their RV. Other than socializing with them, my favorite thing they had was PB&J sandwiches! Who knew they would taste so good?!
Then after some summer solstice hiking in solitude, we contemplated having lunch. I was still kind of full so we decided to push on to the shelter to eat. Well guess what we found there?? More trail magic! The crazy thing about this in was that it was literally on trail! We put our clothes on and joined the two brothers, one who just completed a section, who had dragged a shopping cart full of food and drinks up there from the nearest road crossing. After this weenie roast, we had barely gotten any miles in and we had heard good things about the 501 Shelter.
When we got there, it was immediately decided we would stay. There were bunks and a geodesic skylight in the four-sided shelter aka building PLUS you could get pizza delivered (which we did). We didn’t even get 15 miles in on this full hiking day by we had been having so much fun. It was fun socializing and choosing an all smiles day after the last two had been challenging our spirits.","Second Mountain

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595117,"Day 79- It was cool and breezy today. It definitely gave off the vibe that weather was coming in. Surprisingly, we were one of the first to leave at 7:50! Most other hikers seemed to be getting very comfortable by a fire. 
The hiking was insanely flat with a super short but steep descent down into Port Clinton. For whatever reason, time flew just as fast as the miles did. We can see the rockiness increase though. I was fighting the urge to stop and rub my little doggies in the last 6 miles of the day.
I had never heard of Port Clinton but it is the friendliest town we have been to by far!! We step out on the roadside and someone pulls a U-turn just to offer us a ride. We stop at the corner of town to pull out our maps and we are told we are welcome at the firehouse social club where we get bought multiple beers! It was such a cool dive bar that we could see many of our friends loving. The locals were really sweet and fun to catch to. There were supplies and some trail magic at the town pavilion where we are allowed to camp for free! It truly is incredible and we haven’t even been to the friendly barber yet!
BrokenSeal had so much fun at the firehouse that he returned with more hikers. I stayed at the pavilion to write but some had a trail angel, Tricks, stopping and got some free food from a section hiker who is ending his trip here. Today was simple but fabulous!","501 Shelter

Thank goodness for a roof! It’s the simple pleasures that can bring a smile to our faces. I did some yoga stretching out my back while it poured outside and most people slept around me. Our first stop of the day was for a large breakfast at the 3C’s diner. While walking back, someone offered us a shuttle to Pottsville so we could go to the oldest brewery in America, the Yuengling Brewery! Before going we wanted to organize our things back at the pavilion where some local veterans brought us gourmet donuts (still warm) and ice cold beer. Could Port Clinton be any more generous!?
The Yuengling Brewery tour was cool and we were able to get a nice group of guys to join us. Since it is an East Coast beer, it was a novelty for us to check it out. Over lunch, we changed the channel over our table from televised, competitive corn hole (what?) to the Sweden vs. Germany World Cup game. After a quick hitch back to Port Clinton we relaxed.

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595994,"We didn’t sleep as well last night due to a drive-by yeller and some fireworks but we were still up and out around 8:30. There were some ultrarunner-looking people standing around a van in the tiny downtown but we didn’t think much of it. I had been worried about a tough climb out of Port Clinton based on how steep it was entering town but it wasn’t bad. Four guys speed walking uphill passed us not too long into the hike.
The ridge was rocky in a boulder hopping kind of way and definitely made our fair uneven but it wasn’t terrible. We noticed that a lot of the rocky bits are broken up by long stretches of smooth and flat trail. The sun was out and there was a light breeze plus we were feeling fresh from Port Clinton. We even got some views today, my preferred being at The Pinnacle where we saw our first copperhead snake.
Then it was smooth, like walking down a service road, to a paved road where we found this same group of ultra runners from earlier standing around a bunch of cars. My curious/talkative/always-love-cold-drink self approached one of them. Turns out that one of the runners that had passed us earlier was a guy, named Harvey Lewis, attempting to break the supported-speed record. He had taken a fall up near The Pinnacle and was taking a quick nap in one the vans. It was exciting to be in the presence of greatness as he stepped out of the van, stuffed some food in his mouth, and (with a forced smile) hobbled across the road. Wow- it really puts all of our aches and pains into perspective. It was his 25th day and he had 20 days to go. 
We stopped in the Eckville Shelter for a late lunch where the caretaker threw us beers. Then we churned out 7.4 miles to get one shelter farther where Broken Seal had his worst water trip. We had just missed some rain and a creeping migraine from earlier in the day had dissipated by the time we got there. It was nice to lie down after a nice day.","Port Clinton

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597088,"Day 82- Honestly, it was a loud bunch last night. Whatever. It’s just one of the realities of sleeping in shelters sometimes. Surprisingly, we were the first ones out and the hiking was really easy so we flew. We had a fellow PCTer walk with us for a bit which helped make the miles pass. 
We took a side channel to get some water and pretty soon after returning to the AT, we found two couples setting up trail magic! It was only 11:15 AM so it was too soon to gorge but a beverage sitting in a chair sounded too appealing to pass up. Next thing you know it was almost 3 hours later before we were leaving. The trail angels were two brothers, Chopper and Mountain Goat, who had a hiked in 2016 and were out with their wives with a huge spread for thruhikers. They had the typical things, hamburgers and hotdogs, chips and cold drinks. They also had some unique items like photos of them from the trail, shoelaces, some first aid supplies like ibuprofen, and even yard games and music. They were lovely bunch and it was really nice talking to them. 
By the time we left, our whole day‘s plan was being questioned. Our planned mileage became even more questionable when we found our first blueberry bushes on the trail. As you can imagine, I wanted to sit there for awhile and eat. 
There were a series of road crossings and then we heard it was a notoriously rocky 7 miles without any camping. It was about 5 o’clock and we decided to hitch into a town from the roads and keep today as a super positive, smiles day rather than push late into the night. That’s how we found ourselves in a informal hostel behind Bert’s restaurant. It had a great shower, the best laundry machines we’ve had on trail, and movies. And it was only us and another section hiker in the hostel so we all watched Fargo together. It wasn’t until later in the evening that two older couples arrived. Once everyone had their chores done in the hostel, it was lights out and we fell asleep really quick.","Allentown Hiking Club Shelter

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597084,"Day 83- Without any windows in the room, I slept in more than usual and was the last one to slide it into a booth at Bert’s restaurant on the front side of the building for a hearty breakfast. After eating, everyone was all packed and ready to go except for me so I just threw my belongings in the back of the truck and knew I would get packed up and finalize getting dressed for the day once on the trail. The sun was high at 8:30 AM when we set off and I think we all knew today would be a scorcher. 
As I finalized everything, I heard a familiar voice behind me calling our names: Rocket! She is by far the only other hiker in our vicinity for any sort of extended period of time. We’ve been near each other, but I haven’t seen her since Trail Days and went for a big hug instead of the typical hiker fist bump. We got to climb the rocky, 14er-esque slope out of Palmerton and the grassy, open ridge line together catching up on our hike so far.
Today became a day of hiking with other people very quickly. When Rocket stopped to take a food break, we ended up hiking with Running Griz for a while, then Murph, then Blink. The terrain was flat but still super rocky; the kind of rocks that make your feet hurt. Hiking with these different people really made the time fly by and soon we would quickly be at our intended break spots. 
We left some people at the last shelter before Wind Gap hoping to get a private room to ourselves before we became a trio with Broken Seal’s good friend from Arizona coming to hike with us potentially all the way to Katahdin. A lot of hotels we’re not picking up the phone or returning our voicemails. The one near the trailhead though was not to my liking especially for the price. When we asked about a shuttle into town, the owner’s reaction was to offer us a cold rotisserie chicken someone had left behind that day. We could’ve made it work but I didn’t have a great feeling about staying there.
Broken Seal was really sweet about being flexible to give up our plan of having a hotel room for the night. Instead we found ourselves at a sports bar with Rocket and Blink eating tacos and joking around more. They started only a few days ahead of us from Amicalola and I hope that we will be hiking together for a long time to come. 
It was dark when we left; we pitched our tents behind some car trailers left in a field at the side of the main street. It’s the exact kind of stealth camping Broken Seal does not like doing but those feelings didn’t kick in until it was too late. So after some attempts at calming his nerves we both drifted off to sleep, luckily.","Palmerton

I was impressed by Rocket and Blink- when I peeked out of the tent at 6:20 AM and found them already gone. Our alarm had not even gone off yet. We followed their lead though and immediately put our things together to start hiking out of town.
We started with a climb but it was nice getting it done so early in the day before the rain started coming. The forecast called for scattered showers yet we stayed dry all the way to the Delaware Water Gap. I think partly due to what time we started hiking and also partly due to our eagerness to reach town, we had our 15.5 miles done at around 1 o’clock. Along the way we called Broken Seal’s family to inquire on the status of his very pregnant sister. He’s going to get another nephew very soon and we are incredibly excited. 
We got a really nice first impression of Delaware Water Gap. The first few people we met were super kind. The Deer Head Inn with it’s jazz concerts seem cool. We also popped in free church hostel and was impressed by their arrangement. 
We headed to a hotel for a shower before Big Mac and Willie arrived. Along the way, we had to grab the hotdog and slice of pie $3 special at the drool-worthy delicious bakery. We got into the hotel room just in time before they arrived with big smiles on their faces. It’s been 600 miles since I’ve seen Big Mac and Broken Seal sure was excited to get one of his best friends with him on trail. Broken Seal gave him a shakedown; Willie definitely seems ready.
Big Mac took us to Walmart to do our first resupply with Willy. Broken Seal’s mom had already told Willie the things we’ve been eating and he had been integrating them into his diet already. But doing a food buy was kind of a systematic process that we clued him in on. He was very receptive watching the method to our madness. Before driving back into town and then back to New York City, we went to an authentic Dominican restaurant for an awesome meal. The weather is looking absolutely terrible tomorrow which is kind of a shame for his first hiking day but he’s excited for the rain. Bring it on!","Wind Gap

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595995,"Day 85- Holy Shmolies! What a day!
There was some loud thunder claps and neighbors in the night; the coast was clear by morning. We pounded scrumptious breakfast sandwiches at the bakery and hit the trail with Willy! In addition to crossing into NJ, we crossed our 1300 mile marker! There was some nice trail along the shore of small ponds today. We also had some exposed grassy patches at the top of the ridges to watch the scattered storms move around us. 
Willy was moving well but we still don’t want to throw him into 20 mile days immediately. So we decided to hike the 0.3 off trail to have lunch at the Mohican Outdoor Center. As we approached, there were big black furry things on the ground with some people standing around them. Big black furry things? Oh my goodness! They were black bears!!
A NJ Fish & Wildlife official had sedated these two black bears and was tagging and measuring them. The first was a female yearling, 130 lbs, who had been a nuisance at their dumpster and got into their bear trap that morning. The second was a 3yo male, 300 lbs, who had been circling the female caught in the trap. While we weren’t allowed to take photos, we were allowed to pet the sleeping black bears, touch their pads and claws. I even helped carry the female bear back into the trap so that the official could do a staggered release. In the process of moving her, some liquid, which was probably bear pee, fell onto my foot (honored!).
When it was time to give the bears the reversal injection, we all backed up onto the steps of the lodge. The official had a rubber pellet gun she would use to try and “condition” the bears when it woke up to not like this place. We did the male first; a couple emotions came up when we watched it struggle to take its first steps and then eventually run off. For the female, she roused her entirely within the trap, then she opened the door and scared her off too. Overall, it was a once in a lifetime experience.
We got the final six miles done in and off sprinkles making the rocks slick. We had a nice view from the top of a lockout tower before choosing a place to camp in the trees ridge. My friend Rocket camped with us too and we both had close calls with frozen baby bunnies. Willie kicked butt today- I think he’s going to be really successful out here if he takes a liking to it. It’s also nice to see Broken Seal so happy again since the sad goodbye with Wings.","Delaware Water Gap

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597090,"Day 86- The day started out normal enough. After eating our scrumptious honey buns and flicking slugs off of our tent, Willie led us in some stretching and then we started hiking. While I don’t put much weight towards political state boundaries, entering New Jersey has been a nice change of pace. It’s still kind of rocky but not to the same degree that Pennsylvania was. We also suddenly have been having multiple views per day. Some of our more recent views were populated and developed valleys below us. But since entering the Delaware Water Gap, the views have been much more forested. We’ve also had some great, picturesque lakes. 
The most recent thing is that it’s gotten really hot. Supposedly the high today is only supposed to be in the 80s; starting tomorrow and through the Fourth of July sounds like it’ll be in the 90s. I know I feel like I’m cooking. 
I can only imagine how hot Willie is with this heat and humidity coming from Arizona/Colorado. He still kicking butt on his second day. We thought we lost him when we peeled off to go use the privy at the shelter and refill our water but it didn’t take long to be reunited and it felt so good :-). He’s a fast hiker; it makes me wonder if he may end up reaching Katahdin before us which is definitely sounding like a possibility.
We hiked together for the rest of the day and nothing too noteworthy happened. The toughest part was water. We missed one or two sources somehow and had to push farther than we have would’ve liked to without much liquids for our sweaty systems. We pushed and helped each other get to the Mashipacong shelter where a ridge runner had told us there was potable water stashed this afternoon. The first thing we did was drink before Willie set up his hammock and we got comfy in the shelter. We got to cook a fancy freeze dried meal that someone had put in a hiker box. It was delicious and helped return smiles to our faces.

Today had another heat advisory warning and there was a 10 AM World Cup soccer game. We chose the 10 AM soccer game over going out in the heat. Eric and Nachesca lent us a vehicle for a grocery store and post office run in the morning. We also made sure to get some extra goodies to celebrate Fourth of July with.
The game between Brazil and Mexico was fun to watch even with their star player, Neymar, acting like a baby when fouled. Unfortunately, Mexico lost but it was fun to hang out with my cousin and in the air-conditioning for a while. We met them at the library later on once we were ready to venture outside so they could drop us off at the trail where they had picked us up yesterday.
Thank goodness we were slackpacking today. The heat was overwhelming when we started walking again and I was sending cool fuzzies out to all the other hikers that I knew were out doing their best to stay safe. After passing some cool ponds, we did a little leapfrogging of each other before getting up onto this really beautiful ridge. I think we were able to enjoy it a little more, especially with the scorching heat, because we didn’t have our packs. 
First we crossed the official New Jersey/New York border and then scurried from rock to rock along the extended ridge. It was these nice slab mounds that required a bit of climbing and scrambling to get up and over but it was kind of fun to run down them without a pack on. It also tested our navigation little bit without an abundant amount of trees to put blazes on up there. We would walk along these rock beds and be caught off guard to realize the trail had turned earlier; there’s no leaf litter to see where the trail turned on or off the rocks.
Eric met us at the Baleville Creamery where we ended our day hike with rich ice cream and a nice view. It was 6 PM and I was still melty but ice cream helped along with knowing we would be in an air-conditioned, lovely home that night. We got some Tex-Mex food to go and returned to his home to spend some time with Nachesca and Grace before she went up for bedtime. We stayed late watching a movie and I got to look at some old family photos before retiring to my aunt and uncle‘s home.","Barrett Rd

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597083,"Day 90- As you can imagine, it was hard leaving Warwick. It also didn’t help that I had left the headlights on in the car they let us use. We found it dead when we attempted to leave. Was this a sign that we should stay here? If it was, we didn’t listen and my cousin Eric came to bring us back to the trail one final time. Unfortunately, we didn’t get to see my uncle and aunt as they were still in London with the rest of our family.
Initially, the terrain was similar to what we’ve been going through. Even though there was an odd amount of trash strewn about the trail, it was pretty otherwise with rolling hills. The first road crossing is where our struggles began. We discovered that not only was Broken Seal’s filter broken, now mine was too. A nice thruhiker couple gave us a few iodine pills to help last us until we received new water filters that we ordered online right there on the foot bridge. Still, we called ahead to Rocket and she left us a spare bladder bag of hers so we could carry extra potable water if given the opportunity. Little did we know that was a great decision and helpful kind act from Rocket because throughout the day trail angels Susan and Hiker Man had put water caches at most of the road crossings. It absolutely saved us on what turned out to be a grueling and miserable hiking day in a heat wave.
I might have said this in an earlier journal. If I did, today I trumped it. I have never sweat so much in my entire life!! I felt like I was a mountain spring, water pouring down every square inch of my body. Did I have the super human ability to pull water from the air or was it just me sweating like someone in a sauna?
The heat and humidity was just a layer on top of what was one of our hardest hiking days in a long time. I can’t remember the last time I hiked this slow while putting in so much effort! It seemed like the trail was never flat; it was constant steep but short up and downs. We would be faced with the rock wall with tall steps winding up the face of it only to get to the top and find another staircase-like trail to descend. It was so constant that I was genuinely amazed and impressed by how burly the state of New York was.
It was really challenging mentally too though. Broken Seal and I had discussions questioning our hiking abilities and our strength. Where did our ability to fly uphill go? Then it became, “Are we really going to make it to Maine on time if the rest of the mid-Atlantic is like this?”. We texted Willie who was somewhere far ahead and let him know that we may not reach our intended camp spot that night. That’s not something we had it expected to send after walking over 1300 miles to someone who hadn’t even gotten their first 100 under their belt yet.
The terrain didn’t change much until we crossed into the Harriman State Park in the afternoon. That helped lift our spirits a little because of how beautiful it was even though the elevation changes were similar. Instead of bushy, dense forest, the trail climbed these lovely, grassed fields while still maintaining a shady tree canopy. It was still humid but it was slightly cooler than mid day and we kept pushing on. We pushed through the lemon squeezer and, even after all of this exertion, chose to go the hard way on one of these rock ledges rather than take a bypass. It was late but we finally did make it to Fingerboard Shelter where Willie was waiting for us. There was only a local couple here and they were cheerful. The shelter was beautiful even without a view, just looking at the grassy terrain below us. Nothing too noteworthy happened once at the shelter; it was a regular evening routine of eating and brushing our teeth but the unspoken sense of accomplishment to reach there even after being pushed so hard today was palpable. 
For a legitimate attempt at a full hiking day for us, we only did 15.4 miles in over 10 hours just to give you a glimpse at how much our butts were truly kicked.","NY 17A/ Bellvale Creamery

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596600,"We were in a cloud when we woke up and started hiking. Even though we had packed up our maximum water capacity, we were each left with only a quarter of a liter to get up and over the next peak, Bear Mountain, to our next water source. We were saved by the clouds, which kept it cool and misty, and by munching on a few blueberries along way. There was no one on the summit of Bear Mountain even with a road to the top except thruhikers and a credit card compatible vending machine. It didn’t take much to guzzle down an ice tea before it was time to take the nicely groomed, stairway like trail down to Hessean Lake and the infamous Trailside Zoo.
Since it was the day after Fourth of July, the place was absolutely trashed! At times, the smell was obscene and the lawns had garbage strewn across them. It’s sad that this is how we celebrate this beautiful country. I can only imagine what we would have felt coming through here yesterday when it was packed to the brim.
The zoo itself was nicer than I had anticipated. I’ve been told it was pretty sad and I assumed it was because it was a poorly funded or something. Really, it’s more of a sanctuary for injured wildlife that would not make it in the wild but the facilities were cool. The bear den was the lowest point on the entire AT so that means it’s going to be all uphill from here.
Then came time to cross the mighty Hudson with a nice long bridge walk. Very scenic. I was happy to see a telephone receiver up there for the National Suicide Prevention Hotline. It was starting to get really hot again when we stepped back into the trees so we pushed on separately to make it to a deli/convenient store for lunch and a quick resupply. 
There were a couple picnic tables with umbrellas outside filled with hot, sweaty hikers trying to wait out the heat of the day before hiking on. It was there that we found out one of our buddies had contracted Lyme‘s disease and also where someone decided to end their thruhike because they felt they had not recovered fully from succumbing to heat exhaustion two days before. We drink one final cold beverage before tackling the final 8 or 9 miles of the day to where we had hoped to camp. 
In the later afternoon, it was still hot but the air was more tolerable. We all put our headphones in and busted out the miles only to stop to guzzle ice cold Powerades someone had left in a cooler on the side of the trail (thank you so much!). We called our day at a nicely mowed lawn with a water spigot. We were all mellow and winding down but I think secretly really happy with how the day went.","West Mountain Shelter

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596601,"Day 93- 
Hooray! It was not hot and sticky when we woke up! In the early morning hours, there was a light drizzle and now everything was a lot cooler while still being humid.
I started out solo again using the morning time for some reflection. I feel like the trail has gone back to our idea of normal. In the morning, there were some steep climbs but most of the terrain was still smooth sailing and allowed us to keep our momentum. The guys caught me quickly; Broken Seal walked with me for a little bit before hiking ahead too. By the time I caught our hiker friend, Blink, he told me that Rattler had passed him miles back. I didn’t know we had such a talented speed demon on our hands! 
With Rattler’s arrival, I have not been as great about journaling and so I tried to use the solo opportunity to dictate some journal entries rather than write them. It proved to challenging; the rain droplets falling from the tree canopy made pushing buttons on my cell phone frustrating and impossible. From sweat and rain, all of my clothes were too damp to dry the screen off.
This section of trail was well-maintained even with a lot of blow downs. The local trail maintenance club also had a roadside shelter with bunks, a covered porch, a nice privy, and well. Broken Seal and another guy we’ve been seeing on and off, Prick, were there. I read a little bit in the register and some of the other paper materials they had before throwing the backpack back on. There was a pizza place in 5 miles where we were hoping to watch the Brazil – Belgium quarterfinals game. 
Again, I took my own time getting there so they had just gotten a huge pizza cooked and brought to their table. It wasn’t as unwelcoming as we had heard so we spent a couple hours there watching soccer and making our game plan before hiking our final miles for the day. Systematic racism was our topic of conversation but we didn’t finish it before reaching the shelter (who could? It should be a lifelong convo). The three of us with Prick, Blink, and Rocket all camped together in the cool evening air and we played a couple of rounds of Mafia before calling it a day.","Dennytown Rd

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597081,"Day 94- I know that we’ve been in a heat wave recently but it wasn’t until today that I fully realized how much of an effect it had on our hiking abilities. We were up at 7 AM and had our 22 miles done by 4:30 PM rather easily. Just a couple days ago, it felt like it was a real fight to hit 15 miles.
The day was pleasant! We walked around the scenic Nuclear Lake and then crossed into my old stomping grounds, the New York/Connecticut area. First, we took a break at where my family used to maintain a trail magic spot. Then lingered at Wiley Shelter and noticed some of the additions since I used to come up here in camp. After taking photos with the “Welcome to New England” sign, we hit my favorite favorite local spot called Bulls Bridge! It is the only two or 3 miles of trail that Broken Seal had ever been on before attempting our thruhike. Not only is it it well-maintained section of trail along the river, it’s also a place where my dad, Big Mac, has kayaked and I think that’s pretty cool.
The best part about today was that we had family friends, the Ehrenreich‘s, awaiting us at Bulls Bridge to whisk us to their home where we got absolutely pampered. After not-so-quick run to the local grocery store (where I recognized more people than I had expected considering it’s been about 10 years since I’ve lived here), we came home to wash the heat wave sweat and salt off of our tired bodies. They nourished our souls with good conversation and our bodies with amazing food. Indian curry chicken, corn on the cob, salad, brownies. I hit my sleepy wall during dinner and had to call it a night before sinking into the deepest sleep possible in their luxuriously soft bed.","Morgan Stewart Shelter

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597460,"Day 95- It was hard leaving the comfortable home of the Ehrenreich‘s. The day started out right with a nice breakfast and plenty of treats to take with us including leftovers from the night before. With a couple friends recently getting Lymes disease, we tossed around the idea of taking Broken Seal to a doctor since he’s been feeling pretty fatigued recently. But after some back-and-forth, we decided to hike ahead today as they are the medical services in the near future.
There is a good climb out of Bulls Bridge but the air felt comfortable once we were up on the ridge. Today was the height of my moon so I lagged behind a little bit; Rattler and Broken Seal always waited up for me. I was a little sad to not head into Kent, Connecticut, a town I know well,  but we had just taken care of everything in Sherman and there  was no need to go into Kent too.
By pushing ahead, we got to go through St. John’s ledges, a place I had forgotten about from my childhood. At the bottom there were two guys with a neat trail magic set up at the road. I got a hotdog and a hamburger plus lemonade, fruit, and chocolate before the flat hiking to where we set our shelters up.
We had been stopped at the magic with some other hikers so in addition to the three of us, we were joined by Prickly Butt
and Ghost. Right before we set up camp, we saw to beavers floating in the river and that put a smile on my face before jumping in the tent as quick as possible to avoid as many mosquito bites as possible even (at least a couple are inevitable at this point.","Bulls Bridge

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597743,"Day 98- Today was a bit of a whirlwind. Terrific, but ever-changing. The sun was pretty and shiny when we arose from the blueberry bushes. Rattler, Broken Seal, and I hiked together down towards the first road to hitch into Great Barrington, MA. The New England regional office was closed when we passed so we kept moving along. That’s when I brought up a previous idea of ours which was to hike an additional 8.5 miles to a second road crossing; that way we got to go up and over a small ridge with lighter packs.
We all agreed to push on yet we hiked separately until the Tom Floyd shelter where we lunched. Before reaching there, Rattler got turned around in an S – curve and ended up walking southbound for a little bit until running into Broken Seal and realizing his mistake.I took up the rear (as always) to pick some of the sweetest blueberries and also make some important phone calls.
We got picked up pretty quickly from a cool woman named Bonsai; she gave us candies before dropping us off at a shopping complex. My phone battery was very low so I hadn’t noticed that our previous hiking buddy, Midlife, was on his way to Great Barrington with with his family to meet us! When we reunited, they took us to a late lunch at the nearby brewery where we got to connect with his wonderful family who we had heard so much about while keeping our eyes on the England-Croatia scoreboard in the background. It was fun and funny at the same time seeing Midlife with no facial hair and in real life clothes but it was the same man and it was a good time. 
They ferried us around town to pick up last minute items. We have decided that the three of us will hike separately for the next couple of days, Broken Seal and Rattler racing ahead to catch the final game while I take my time to enjoy some sweet spots between here and Dalton. It meant I needed my own toilet paper, bug spray, bear line and a few other things.
Midlife and his family dropped us off at the trailhead when I realized I left my trekking pole in front of the Dollar Tree. The two guys went ahead and after a final favor from Midlife to retrieve the pole, I started hiking too. 
Once I met up with them at the Mount Wilcox South Shelter, we began the prep to hike separately for a couple days. The first task I started was to take photos of the maps for them; I noticed a glaring mistake immediately. We thought that Dalton, Massachusetts was 70 miles away hence the desire for the guys to hike some 30 mile days. Really, Dalton was only 40 miles. Secondly, the final match was going to be held on Sunday, not Saturday like we believed. Suddenly all bets are off! We would be hiking together tomorrow! We stopped our busywork after realizing our mistakes and instead focused on getting to bed.","Jug End

I was glad that we hiked together the entire day. The hiking was pleasant with a gentle sun overhead and we were moving pretty well I think partly due to the excitement of reaching the Upper Goose Pond Cabin. We had recently heard amazing things about this place including how they provide a free pancake breakfast to thruhikers.
We picked up Blink along the way at a little trail-side shed that used on the honor system to have treats out for us. There were cold sodas and cookies but also local, hard-boiled eggs and alpaca fur for sale. Fast hiking with good conversation continued with a nice lunch stop on a small, wooden bridge with a little crawdads and fish below.
As we neared the pond, we could see a bearded man in a canoe and we knew we were almost there. The cabin is a spectacular little thing painted red with bunks upstairs and a small living room and kitchen below. The first thing we did was go hang out on a short dock lakeside where we swam and splashed around. It was a little slice of heaven. Now hikers were coming in at all hours and it was fun sitting on the porch. I stayed up late with the caretakers, Rob and Bonnie, and a thruhiker named Sublime chatting about trail culture and highlights ahead. It was a late night for me but I was one happy girl.

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597304,"Day 100- Today was a special day for so many reasons! It started with coffee and pancakes drenched in syrup from the cabin caretakers, Bonnie and Rob. Most of the hikers were close to being ready to go. Instead of Dalton, many hikers are pushing to Williamstown to watch the final World Cup game on Sunday morning and my two comrades decided to join. Of the full house last night, everyone headed out except for one hiker, Red Panda, plus Broken Seal and I. Rattler was going ahead with the mass; Broken Seal would catch up this afternoon. Luckily, we were already prepared to hike separately for a couple days and I chose to nero out of Upper Goose Lake Cabin today rather than nero into Williamstown for the game. While it would’ve been cool, this feels like a special place and I was appreciative of Broken Seal for spending the morning with me.
Instead of putting our backpacks over our shoulders, we put life jackets on and took one of the canoes out on the lake. We paddled to the far end to the marsh and, our way back, stopped in the middle of the lake to have deep life talk. Today marks 100 days on trail for us and there was a lot to reflect on. Not only did we reflect on the trail and the journey, but also our relationship and what’s going to happen moving forward. 
Nothing is guaranteed for us yet we have profound faith and trust in each other and try to maximize the present regardless of what twists and turns may come our way. We wrapped it up with a solid handshake.
It can be scary sometimes but mornings like today’s really helps. After a little more paddling, we return to the dock. We shared a big hug and kiss before Broken Seal went back to the trail. I, on the other hand, returned to the lake for another swim. I floated in an inflatable ring and let little fish nibble at the dead skin on my feet; it was blissful. 
A couple friends we haven’t seen in a while had strolled in by the time I came up to have lunch at the cabin. We chatted about spirituality (since I was in that kind of mood). It was hard to step away; at 3 PM I was making northward progress.
It’s been a while since I’ve hiked alone but it’s pretty excited. This afternoon, I saw two adult male black bears which is pretty cool and I was lucky enough to fill up at the last good water source before reaching the October Mountain shelter. Another first on this hike was having a shelter completely to myself. I was a little jittery yet relaxed pretty quickly once I felt like I had Rattler’s shelter system was set up correctly. 
It was a clear night and I could watch the clouds turn pink through the tree canopy before closing my eyes and trying to fall sleep. The buzzing of the mosquitoes were louder than I had imagined. It was my first time camping in a hammock the mosquitoes were literally an inch from my ear. That high-pitched sound was not relaxing like white noise. I don’t know when but eventually I drifted off since it was suddenly a lot darker when I had pulled the buff over my eyes.
My mind raced not with fear but with excitement and anticipation for what lies ahead in the rest of our thruhike but, maybe more importantly, what the future holds for Broken Seal and I.","Upper Goose Lake Shelter

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598225,"Day 101- I had wanted to be hiking earlier today but the quality of sleep was poor last night. I still have to get used to the hammock and figure out the best way to arrange my systems to ensure a good night’s sleep. I didn’t get moving till 8 AM but the terrain was relatively flat and flowery and I made it to Dalton before noon. I had aspirations to reach the post office before it closed at noon but I got distracted by Tom‘s house along the sidewalk in town. I decided to have a snack there and get an AT passport stamp since I knew the crew has slept here last night. While I was sitting on his porch, he came out with an ice cream sundae for me with whip cream, peaches, and cherries. It caught me totally by surprise but I was so appreciative. I thanked him for his generosity and kept hiking on to Cheshire in the afternoon.
I only saw 2 other hikers at that point in the day and was with them when the woman took a gnarly fall and hit her head on a rock. I have some medical training and the husband was an EMT so, between the two of us, we got her cleaned up and she was on her feet in no time. 
Luckily, it was only 2 miles into Cheshire where we then tried to get them a ride to the nearest urgent care to get cleaned up. To do so, we went to a trail – friendly church called St. Mary’s Assumption and there we met a sixth grader named Northstar. He has become “the giver of trail magic” in the church parking lot. He called his parents up telling them to deliver “the goods“ and asked if his dad could take the injured hiker to the urgent care.
 I had planned to be farther by now but I wanted to stick with them until they were on their way. I whipped up dinner there in the church parking lot and chatted with the few hikers there; I did resist the temptation to stay but only got a handful of miles in before calling it a night.
I was a little better at setting up the hammock this time and got the tarp up as well. There were almost no bugs here; just a nice, cool breeze. It didn’t take long before it was lights out for me!","October Mountain Shelter

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597463,"Day 102- I was moving by 6:20 AM in the misty boreal forest and the subalpine environment on the side of Mount Greylock. I took my time and listened to some podcasts while moving through the green tunnel. It felt very much like my memories of hiking just below the tree line in the Whites. The summit of Mount Greylock was underwhelming as it was completely socked in and the lodge on top didn’t have an AT Passport stamp. I kept moving, motivated by the idea of getting to watch some of the final game with Broken Seal and friends.
It cleared up as I worked my way down the mountain. I didn’t get any views, it just got hotter. I was relieved to have reached the bottom of the mountain yet didn’t realize how much shade the trees had provided up to this point. There was a half mile road walk to the street where I could hitch into Williamstown and it was scorching. I hadn’t worn my visor and glasses today as it was supposed to be cloudy. That left me hitchhiking for 25 minutes looking into the sun, getting cooked before I am enthusiastic local couple picked me up. before dropping me off at the Purple Pub where the three hikers were watching the soccer game, the couple gave me a tour around town and showed me a local park where I could camping. It was appreciated but, in that moment, all I wanted was water and to be with my friends.
While I didn’t see kick off, I got to watch most of the game. It’s definitely more fun watching it in that atmosphere versus from a phone on trail. The crowd was rooting for France but deep down I had hoped Croatia would come out on top.
After some discussion, we decided to get a room at the Willow Motel. We turned up the air conditioning, flopped into the big beds, and watched the Harry Potter marathon that was on all night. Other than stepping outside to get dinner and drinks, the afternoon was 100% relaxing.","Side of Mt. Greylock

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598233,"Day 103-  A very inexpensive resupply at Dollar General was the first thing on our to-do list today followed by a stop to my favorite breakfast eatery, Dunkin’ Donuts! There’s just something so New England about it for me. After we indulged, the friendly staff at the motel gave us a ride back to the trail-head, we already knew it was going to be a hot one today. Luckily the trail provides. Someone had some ice pops in a cooler near the road and then at the last house before we stepped into the forest, someone had a little sign saying we could take water from their hose. Speaking with transparency, broken seal was not a happy camper this morning to be hiking. For him the idea of laying in bed in an air-conditioned room with junk television playing sounded kind of appealing. Instead, here we were. Being a sweaty mess as we crossed from Massachusetts into Vermont and onto the LONG TRAIL!
I’ve noticed another shift amongst hikers recently which is that a lot of people are becoming focused on the end. We’re meeting people who are speeding up to meet deadlines and everyone is doing some planning or at least discussion as to what comes next. It’s hard though because we still have almost 600 miles to go; you’re definitely not close to finishing but I can tell people are getting eager to reach Katahdin and be done. The height of Broken Seals frustrations today was when we passed multiple dry water sources that were supposed to be reliable according to the guidebook. He had to hike back a bit to a puddle he saw to get a splash of water before we moved on. Again though the trail provides, no more than five minutes later we see a car parked on a forest service road with hikers sitting around it.

Hooray! Trail Angel Ken was there with all kinds of goodies including apple cider donuts and long trail beer! How fitting for the first 10 miles of the Vermont. Most importantly though, he had water! I never imagined water would be an issue here in New England but it feels so precious right now.After good conversation we filled all of our bottles, and hiked on into the afternoon. Broken Seals spirit was totally rejuvenated and we had great engaging conversation all the way to the shelter. It’s amazing that after 102 days we can still find great things to talk about.
Rattler, Red Panda, Running Grizz, and 47 were all at the shelter when we arrived a little before 5 PM. We snacked and laughed before all six of us kept going as there was supposed to be a reliable source 3 miles before the steep decent to the road into Bennington, but it was dry as well so we started the descent. It wasn’t the end of the world, and when we got to the bottom there was even more true magic in the form of hot cocoa packets and a reliable water source. We could hear thunder and it was already later than we had planned on hiking so all six of us set up our shelters and bundled in before the heavy rains came. In general, we timed it perfectly even though Broken Seal probably could’ve used an extra minute or two to set up the bear hang as he got a bit wet. Finally after a long day we got to eat in the tent together and take a look at the last section of maps that Rattler had just mailed in. What lies ahead looks menacing but definitely within our ability level.","Williamstown

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598226,"Day 104- The thunder was already threatening when we woke up. I made the decision to hike in only my underwear and rain gear in hopes that I could keep as much of my clothing as dry as possible. We were able to get a couple of miles under our belts before the clouds turned dark within only a couple of minutes. It was like something out of a movie. The bullet hard rain and nearby lightning soon followed.
I was hiking alone at this point up the side of Glastenbury Mountain. After a close call with lightning on the PCT, I don’t mess with the stuff and I sat on my foam pad smiling through the worst of it. I have not seen this kind of heavy rain in awhile. As we were hiking, we could see little leaf levees break and then cascade down the trail. That part was kind of cool.
 I asked around later and everyone else had hiked straight through it. The group of men I’m around right now were having lunch at a shelter just before the true summit of Glastenbury. This storm had died down immensely but I could still hear rumbling in the distance and I wanted the peace of mind of being up and over this thing just in case there was more weather headed our way. That meant a late lunch for me at a shelter 4 miles down the way. We chatted with Red panda and running Griz about their plans for the coming days and which towns they would be going into for food. We like to keep it loosey-goosey ourselves but it’s fun knowing what other people are doing.
We had gotten between 1.5 and 2 inches over the morning so we were wading our way through a lot of the trail. It was amazing how just the day before we had to hike extra mileage due to the dry conditions and now we were soaked; the ground was completely saturated. Even though it was wet and he was in some pain, the trail really was beautiful with the dense pines and eye catching trees bending in all sorts of directions. 
Everyone else hiked about 23 miles including Rattler. Broken Seal and I hiked only 4 miles out from my very late lunch before chafing set it on his part and I was happy to call it at the Story Spring Shelter. The shelter was full when we pulled up but we needed some privacy anyway had a great tent spot on the trees. It was only dripping so we set up a line to dry some items. Broken Seal took care of himself and I took care of my feet which had been waterlogged all day. Luckily, I hadn’t had any pain or discomfort. Peeling my socks off though revealed a gross picture of mud that had worked its way under my peeling skin. I’m not one to wash up in water sources but, in this case, I needed the help of running water. I just made sure to do it far from where people would be collecting their drinking water.
We haven’t ended a day this early in awhile but I honestly enjoyed it. It was fun to just lie in the tent for bit after hiking. For some reason, it’s not the same as lying down to go to bed.

What a glorious view! From the top of the tower on this historic summit, we could see miles and miles of pines with undulating ridge lines in the horizon. Vermont is a beautiful, beautiful state.The hiking was flat and easy from there and we moved and leapfrogged each other as the afternoon went by. We had a terrific lunch on the side of Griffin Lake where we pulled our tent and other items out of our backpacks to dry in the sun. We talked about food, specifically town food and how good it would taste. A road leading into Manchester Center was within reach so we hiked our (literally) little butts off to the highway and almost immediately were able to hitch into town.Since we were at a grocery store, we resupplied to get an extra town or two farther along with purchasing a fresh rotisserie chicken, a loaf of bread, and a container of potato salad that the three of us voraciously consumed in the shopping mall plaza. Its moments like this that really make us look like hiker trash and would normally be socially unacceptable. We had a really quick turnaround time in town but still didnt get back to the trailhead until about 7:30 PM. We knew our buddies, Rocket and Blink, were camped at the top of Bromley mountain only 3 miles away so we pushed into the sunset to enjoy the evening with them and to get some help on the bag of wine the Broken Seal carried up. The sunset from the top was so orange; a brilliant orange splashed across the sky. Rattler set up his hammock underneath the ski lift ramp; Broken Seal and I lay out our things on the floor of the ski patrol warming hut before we crawled into Blinks tent and talked for hours. When I unzipped the rain fly of his tent and crawled out to go to my sleeping bag, I was amazed by how clear the starry night was. So we moved our mini fiesta outside and sat on the chairlift giggling and bonding (quietly, respectful of other hikers) for hours into the night. Today was a marvelous day and these are the memorable nights.","Story Spring Shelter

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598245,"Day 106- I was groggy when I finally woke up on the floor of the warming hut. The rubber flooring they have for ski boots was surprisingly comfortable to lay on. The sun was high and the air was warm even with a steady breeze at the top. Since we had hiked in late, I had not noticed the extent of our 360° view from the summit. We were feeling pretty good this morning; shots of Vermont maple syrup helped Broken Seal especially.
We were the last people to leave the ski warming hut and hike down one of the ski slopes to continue along the Long Trail/Appalachian Trail yet today was full of friends. I had only brief moments of walking alone since there was always a hiker at every break. The trail has been in great condition and I’m getting more used to the roots across the trail. We got to have lunch at another scenic lake today. This time, our food bags were filled with yummy snacks that we would’ve missed out on had we not gone into Manchester Center the night before (I’m citing the chocolate chip cookies specifically but it was all good).
I kept changing up who I was hiking until I reached Big Branch creek. The cool water running down the riverbed filled with boulders and small swimming holes was too inviting to ignore. Rattler was already dunking his head in the water and I soon tiptoed in myself while everyone else was chatting and filling up their water bladders on the shore. I think more people would’ve come in but a southbounder let us know there was trail magic that included beer just a mile or two further north. 
Suddenly I was alone at the creek; it’s amazing how fast it for hiker can move when motivated by magic. When I came around the bend, I was surprised at how many thruhikers were sitting alongside the road at the trail magic spot; there was a group of five or six people I’d never met before. By the time I left an hour and a half later they are even more new faces. The folks putting on the trail magic were extremely kind and generous; they had cold beer, hotdogs, chips, and more. It was a good, inviting  atmosphere and they were well stocked to stay for a couple days 
I headed out with Running Griz since I wanted to be done hiking before dark. The guys can be turbo speed hikers when they want to so it wasn't shocking to see them come running into the little campsite I had set up on the side of the trail while later, feeling a little more than tipsy yet with big smiles on their faces. 
Today had been awesome except for one thing. Right before we reached our campsite, we passed a group of young hikers with one individual sawing off thick branches from a dead tree in revegetation zone for a campfire. I fought this urge to be the one to reprimand him and talked with Griz about returning to a nearby, official shelter with a caretaker and letting him approach the group. As we were discussing what to do, the man with the saw acknowledged us in a way that makes me think he was genuinely aware of how non-LNT his actions were. Griz clued him in and he quickly walked back to his group and campsite. Broken Seal told me later that the caretaker was pretty low from his interactions with that group. Not only were they camping in a prohibited area but campfires also were not allowed. These stories irk me since the trail is a special place that we have to respect and protect for all who come behind us. As trail ambassadors, us thruhikers have to do our best about being considerate to others!!","Bromley Summit

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603671,"Is it terrible to say today was not noteworthy. The trail was smooth and the weather was nice. It was cruising terrain that ended with a strong downhill to the highway where Broken Seal, Rattler and I could hitch into Rutland. Along with Running Griz and Red Panda, the two of them took off and I had the trail to myself. It was not something we had talked about beforehand and I was a little sad about it. They made it into town and decided we would stay at the Yellow Deli before I even reached the road.
A quick and nice hitch into Rutland helped lift my spirits a little. I also found the Yellow Deli Hostel to be very nice and I got some nice loaner clothes. We had our first chats with southbounders and walked with them across Rutland to the Twelve Tribes property where they were having their celebration. It involved singing, dancing, preaching, and then an incredible meal! I could not have guessed where today would have ended but I was definitely not complaining getting into the clean dorms with my very full belly.","Campsite Past Little Rock Pond

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603675,"Honestly, today was a bit of a disaster. After taking the local bus up US-4, we began hiking southbound up Killington and then down to the road where we had hitched into Rutland the day before. We had grabbed two little daypacks that Broken Seal and Rattler were carrying. Within 15 minutes, I was alone on the trail with only a 0.7L water bottle in my hand. While this particular incident was not incredibly noteworthy, all of my emotions and frustrations about getting left behind boiled over. At the top of the AT, there is a steep 0.2 mi side trail to the proper summit of Killington. When I approached and saw Rattler sitting on the ground, I let him know I was continuing to summit. I was not in the best place to address the issue there. The summit was pretty but I was out of water after my four mile climb so I went to the Killington Lodge.
Over a half hour later, the guys had not showed up. Turns out they didn’t know about the summit lodge and kept hiking southbound on the assumption that I had kept hiking too. Broken Seal knew I was upset when he finally called me to find out where I was.

They waited for me on the side of the trail and were very receptive when I talked through why I was upset and they apologized. They asked to hike the rest of the way with me but I didn’t want to; I wanted a little space to reflect on how the crucial conversation went. It felt good to release the things that had been pent up but it was exhausting.

They did wait at the road to hitch in with me though. I didn’t have much energy and we eventually called a shuttle because it was taking a while. This turned out to be in my favor because it turns out the shuttle driver and I had a mutual friend. This friend, Travis, is a past AT thruhiker I have known for almost eight years. I knew he was in the area but was surprised to find out that he was at the Inn at Long Trail that night and the shuttle driver was supped to be joining him shortly. I called the driver up and he picked me up within five minutes to go hang out with Travis. It did make for a late night that was exacerbated by some turmoil between other hostel guests upon my return. While I was with Travis, Seal was with Rattler and other hikers across the seat doing karaoke. I hope that having these separate evenings after a tough hiking day helped.","VT 103 / Rutland

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598241,"Day 109 - Because I’d stayed up late the night before, I didn’t make it down to help prepare breakfast this time. The hiker hostel had been more full and there were other hikers already helping out now. Breakfast was great again with scrambled eggs with veggies and meat, rice, and tomatoes plus lots of mate.We did a resupply at Price Chopper which is becoming our preferred grocery store except for their muffins. The highlight of the morning for the team was when Broken Seal and Rattler went to Gamestop where they picked up a used gameboy and a couple games to play at night. I’ve already heard a lot of conversation about Pokémon and I have a feeling it’s about to increase tenfold.
 We did our part in helping clean the hostel before leaving. We wanted some sandwiches from the Yellow Deli to fill our stomachs with some real food instead of moer tuna wraps. We found ourselves crammed at a table with Rocket, Blink, Flip, and Meatloaf; feels like we're starting to get a tramily. We took the bus again out Route 4; it was cloudy and misty but it wasn’t raining like it had in town that morning.
Today was an improvement for me as the two guys hung with me the whole way to the shelter. The trail here felt full with pines and firs; you can almost smell the difference with the rain. It was only a few miles before we peeled eastward off of the Long Trail and towards Katahdin. I plan to return to this place though and finish off the rest of the Long Trail in September. 
Flip and Meatloaf were already at the shelter along with the first two southbounders that we get to camp with and ask a lot of questions. One of them was Mantra Dynasty who had been at the Inn at Long Trail with Travis‘s group the night before. It’s hard to articulate the difference and mentality between the northbounders and the southbounders but it was certainly cool getting to speak with them. Regardless of which direction we were hiking, everyone was in bed by 8:15 PM.","US 4/Rutland

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598230,"Day 110 –This was, by far, the worst night on trail. As it got dark, heavy rains came and I was located right under a drip in the roof. Broken Seal was dead asleep and his halfhearted attempt to slide over did very little to help. I spent a lot of the night trying to scoot my pad closer to Broken Seal. Every time a new wave of heavy rain would come, I’d be wide-awake trying to make sure my sleeping bag was not getting wet from the splash in the little puddle right next to me.
We had talked about getting an early start but there was no part of me that wanted to get up when the time came. I wanted to sleep! Rattler and he lingered until I finally sent them off. This is the first day on this thruhike that I truly did not want to hike one bit.
My efforts to fall back asleep did not help and at 9:30 AM, I finally stepped out from under the roof of the shelter into heavy, heavy rain. No hopes of staying dry on a day like today so I kept my rain jacket in my backpack and embraced the wetness. I have very little to say about the trail today as I kept my head down and headphones in to try and zone out of my unpleasant mood and unpleasant situation. 
At a moment when the rain was light, a small raspberry patch appeared to lift my spirits a little. I was also able to duck into a cool cabin called the Lookout.The one thing that really motivated me to hike at all today was reaching Dan’s home where I had a feeling a warm shower and bed was waiting for me.
I got there after 3 PM and had a warm welcome from Dan. We decided to stay and after the warm shower, my goal was to stay dry. Other hikers came as well and made themselves comfortable in his large barn across the street. Travis was not able to get off from work but it was a full house anyway.
Broken Seal and I were finally able to have an overdue conversation about some little frustrations between the two of us that have been building up. We both gave each other feedback and we are going to work on some specific communication issues we’ve been having. After we got that over with, we hung out with Dan a little bit before Rattler joined us in the home to cook our Knorr Sides the correct way they are supposed to be prepared. I must say they were actually really delicious. Broken Seal sent me to sleepy land soon after our meal with a foot rub at the end of the night.","Stony Brook Shelter

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598239,"Day 112- Today was an unexpectedly awesome day. I had a terrific, much-needed sleep and the sun was shining when we got a move out of Dan’s house little after 8 AM. The elevation profile was solid; they were now significant climbs but everything was steep making the elevation profile line like some gnarly teeth. As always, great conversation helps.
Our first stop of the day was at Firefly and Loon’s house where they have baked goods and cold beverages on their back porch for sale. We dove into a big brownie and some hard-boiled eggs; Rattler got a warm chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich. It’s little setups like this that inspire some ideas as to future home arrangements for me.
After a steep climb from their house, we caught Running Griz and spent the rest of the day with him. At the one waymark for today with a view, I found the largest raspberry bush yet! The bushes were heavy with raspberries almost falling from their stems. In addition to abundant raspberries, There were abundant southbounders. We saw over 15 by the end of the day. I got confirmation that I somehow missed my friends, Karma and Veggie who are southbounding.
In the afternoon, we hit West Hartford, VT where the Hart family runs a little hostel. We weren’t planning on staying but one of the members called to us to come and get a cold soda and watermelon before we kept walking to the shelter where we would spend the night. Throughout the day I thought we had been surrounded by beauty. Not only were there kind people, the forest felt ever-changing today and we passed through a lot of big timber groves. The sunshine also stuck with us all day making it a little humid and sticky but I enjoyed this much more than the downpour we received yesterday.
When we reached the Happy Hill Shelter at 6:15 PM, there were more southbounders and immediately they all recommended we push on into Norwich/Hanover. We called some phone numbers on the list of trail angels and was connected with Jenny! We knew it was getting late in the day so we got a move on down the 3+ miles of trail remaining before it was pavement time.
More surprises and trail love was in store for us! After connecting with her, we went to Dan & Whit’s where we got a 4-person pot roast dinner and 3 dozen bagels for free! When we got back, Jenny, who is the priest for the episcopal church next door, gave us a tour of her great house. There were loaner clothes to use while we did laundry, showered, and ate. It was late when I finally made it up into the hiker dorm she had but I was so grateful for all of the love that had been extended to us today.","VT 12/Dan's House

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599338,"Day 118- The air was crispy when we started our early morning hike up Mt Guyot! The cloudy haze cast pink hues across the layered, mountainous horizon as we broke the tree line briefly. Now, every viewpoint showcases the clear profile of Mt. Washington and the Presidential Range. We are definitely here in the Whites, this place we have been hiking towards for almost four months! Ohh, the emotion!
This morning had the swiftest miles since we entered NH. Other than a viewpoint, we did not stop until over 6 miles in at the Mizpah Hut for a stamp and an unsuccessful attempt at getting leftovers. That was a bit of a bummer because I was incredibly hungry! Full on hunger. There were only two rolls of Smarties in my food bag, everything else had to be rehydrated.
The hunger helped us push out the final (relatively flat) 7+ miles to Crawford Notch where the wonderful Big Mac was waiting with beverages and guacamole! He put my tummy at easy.
We spent a couple of hours in Bethlehem nearby to resupply and have lunch at DQ where we ran into an acquaintance of Dad’s and had more strangers ask if we were siblings. Rattler thought it was hilariously bizarre.
The boys cutely fell asleep in the backseat on the way to town and on the way home, oops, I mean back to the trail. The weather was perfect for hiking so we knocked a couple miles out of the climb up Mt Webster where we found a nice ledge to camp on. 
We were only nine miles from the summit of Mt. Washington and deserved a memorable night. We got to watch the sunset over a tall ridge with beams of light shooting diagonally across the valley below us. We cooked, stretched, danced, and ate the night away until dusk fell and we assumed to our horizontal positions.","South Twin Mountain

We only accomplished a few tasks after sleeping in and a delicious breakfast Anne made for us! The thing is though that we needed it! Our bodies are tired to the core. I am not counting down the days for this to end but certain aspects of ‘normal life’ sound appealing. 
We all wanted one last bathe before finally getting our butts back in the rental car at 2 PM. Taco Bell and Dollar General were our only two stops before dropping the car off behind the company building in Gotham where we were approached by a cop. 
I wasn’t too worried when he pulled up (white privilege!) and he ended up offering us a ride to the other end of town where hitchhiking would be much easier! This was my first time sitting in the back of a cop car and I had a good time considering the circumstances. After him, the first car we put our thumbs out for pulled over and drove us the rest of the way. There was a great campsite at the first water source of the afternoon and life was good.

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600945,"Day 125- Fun first day in Maine. We got up early to tackle Mahoosic Notch which was a total blast for us. I had expected a large open boulder field like the Ramparts at Carter Notch but instead it was a narrow canyon with large boulders. I had wondered how we would navigate across the Notch but the only decision-making we had was whether to go left, right, over, or under the individual boulders choking the Notch. The air down there had settled overnight and was cold; we had the whole Notch to ourselves.
From there, we split up to hike at our own paces. I had the kind of day I love with nice views, comfortable weather, a good audiobook, and a sustainable pace. Slabby climbs and descents are one of my weaknesses and there was a lot of it today but I didn’t mind too much.
Big Mac was at Grafton Notch waiting for us with lunch as well as some extra beverages to share with our friends who came to the parking lot later. He drove us down the road a bit to some waterfalls where the boys soaked and napped while Big Mac and I had more life talks. 
In all, we used 3+ good hours of hiking time to hang but it was well worth it. Today had some of our hardest terrain so there was no need to push for a 20 mile day. Instead, we only needed another 5 miles to get to a lean-to. Less than 10 minutes in, the rain started. 
It wasn’t bad until we hit the alpine zones on the Baldpate mountains. The West peak got us soaked with sideways rain. The East peak made me a little nervous with a long, final, slabby climb to the top; I could easily imagine sliding back to the bottom like a penguin if I slipped. We hadn’t heard lightning for a while but I didn’t like it. As we neared the top, the wind died down and the clouds parted for an astounding view!! It felt rewarding for pushing through the discomfort. 
The climb up had good storytelling and it continued all the way down to our destination of the day. My knees aches but we were all in good spirits as we chowed down on junk food to finish out the great day.","Full Goose Shelter

There was some enjoyable alpine environments with the absolute best blueberries on trail. Big Mac met us at a terrific overlook of the Rangeley lake chain with a top notch lunch spread. The final 13-mile slackpack to the highway into Rangeley was the first relatively flat walking although it was extremely muddy and rooty. 
Unfortunately, we couldn’t enjoy it. We were tired and it didn’t take long to start taking our frustration and stress out on each other. This led into multi-hour long talks about our relationship but we are exhausted so they didn’t turn out that well. 
We both recognize that we might have prioritized getting to Katahdin over the self-care of our relationship. Have we done some irreparable damage to our relationship? Can we adventure like this again together without easily triggering the Achilles heels that we have developed m? We don’t know but we will at least make it to Katahdin.
Spirits were low and we walked in silence for the last six miles arriving at the parking lot at 8:30pm, well after dark. Rattler and Big Mac were in the parking lot with sandwiches and fresh mozzarella taking good care of us.

No big revelations or anything but the edge to our pain has worn down and smoothed out a little. Once we picked up Rattler at his own campsite, we stuck together up and over Sugarloaf and then the Crockers. We crossed a cool plaque marking the section of trail that completed the entire AT; that point also marked that we had exactly 200 miles remaining.
 The up and down today was a little steep requiring me to put a hand down once in awhile so we weren’t flying. It didn’t matter though since we knew where we were headed when we hit the road crossing. 
For the final descent, we went at our own pace and I could feel my knees screaming at the end of the 3,000 ft. Broken Seal did wait for me once at the 2000 mile marker!!  That was a huge accomplishment for both us obviously but we didn’t dwell on it too much as we had a party to get to.
Our buddy, Running Griz, was in the parking lot ready to whisk us to his family’s ski condo. It was a full house with him, his girlfriend, her parents, her siblings and nephews, three different couples, us three hikers, and two dogs. They were so incredibly welcoming and fed us extremely well! We all bathed (I got the jacuzzi tub) and got loaner clothes while we washed all of our items.

That meant lounging in pajamas Griz’s wife brought for me, good conversation with his in-laws, amazing food and tea, and some internet time. We mobilized to go check out a local swimming hole with a sweet cliff jump but other than that, I was sedentary. 
Today was so fun that it did make me a little excited to finish this thruhike. I love what we are doing but a couple of days in pajamas and access to a full kitchen sounds fun for a change. I don’t want that full time by any means but I think my body could use it just as much as my mind.","

The beautiful Bigelows lay ahead but I felt significantly weighed down by my pack. It hadn’t been this heavy since VT, before Big Mac started being our trail angel support. I had become a weeny and the guys had to wait awhile at Horn Pond for me but we had nice weather on our side.
The views at the top were stunning and illustrated nicely where we recently came from and where we were going. We had a scenic lunch atop West Bigelow before summiting Avery Mountain and walking the five miles to Little Bigelow. It felt like it took forever especially since my stomach was not completely at ease. 
On our way off of Avery, some clouds had started to roll in and they helped contribute to a great final view from the Bigelows. As the last notable range on trail, the end actually feels near. No major steep climbs nor descents lay between us and Katahdin. 
My pace slowed the final few miles to the lean-to so that I could pick blueberries along the way. It was only Griz and the two of us in the lean-to with only one other hiker camping. While the chatting and stretching felt nice, it felt even better closing my eyes at 8:30pm.","ME 27 / Stratton

We spent some time this morning in Onesimus’s RV having coffee and ice cream bars. He’s a trail angel following hikers northbound and this is the third time we met hit since Big Branch, VT.
It was go time after our stimulants and we had the easiest terrain since MA!! At times it was rocky like PA and other times it was dense woods like southern VA. It feels like it has been forever since twenty miles was not difficult. Running Griz rolled his ankles some and did not find it as effortless as us.
The highlight for me was crossing paths with Pappy- the 87 yo thruhiking followed up by lunch on a small, sandy beach. There were light showers in the afternoon but not enough to deter us from checking out the lean-tos and small stream waterfalls we passed. 
The guidebook says we cannot camp along the Kennebec River and the official ferry service ends at 2pm so we made sure to find a sweet spot to camp for the night.

Other than Moxie Bald, named after my childhood dog, the terrain was totally flat to Monson. Moxie was in a cloud but gifted us with the tastiest blueberries yet. We had places to go and people to see so we limited our indulgence and kept a steady pace all day.
There were a couple streams/rivers to ford  so we just went in with our shoes on rather than take them on and off at each crossing. We paced some lakes and walked along the west branch of the Piscataquis River for a long while. The sound of the running water really soothing. 
There has not been really flat terrain in a long time and we kind of surprised ourselves by finishing the 22 miles at 3:30.  When we made it to Shaw’s Hostel in Monson, the final trail town, we got to business. We went to the AT Office to get Baxter Park Info, showered and did laundry before having a celebratory meal with Rattler and Running Griz at the delicious BBQ joint in town. I slept poorly the night before so my socializing was minimal while Broken Seal had some beers with our friends. We do not know the majority of people here but that is typical.

They came around asking how people wanted their eggs cooked and then the plates of food started flowing: bacon, potatoes, three eggs and all-you-can-eat blueberry pancakes. We left the table feeling extremely satiated and wobbled off to the AT Office after helping Rattler locate his missing wallet in the trash.
Wendy at the office helped me make reservations for Big Mac to hike Katahdin with us and let us use her WiFi to continue in our search for housing in Austria. It’s been tough on the trail with our irregular access to internet or computers. Broken Seal has received three offers but none have worked out in the end.
Shaw’s Hostel also has a gear store and a resupply in the barn out back. It’s definitely pricier here but there are not really any other options. They had a good selection though. We are forgoing a food drop in the 100-Mile Wilderness and are packing out 6+ days of food. Excluding water, our pack weights came to 24lbs and 27lbs.
Today, we also said goodbye to Rattler and Running Griz. We are finishing our thruhike while they still have many miles to go down south as flip floppers so I think we have a different mentality than they do. We definitely could average 18 miles a day and finish with them but we have worked so hard on this hike that we deserve the opportunity to enjoy this beautiful place if we so choose. With 1 extra day of food, the daily average becomes 15 miles and we get that buffer to hang out at cool spots and swim in any lake we want. We will at least see them when they hike down from the summit.
It was a tough decision but it immediately felt like the right one when we started hiking. We agreed on having no alarms this week, no daily mileage planned- we are purely taking things as they come. We are happy how it went and have learned a lot from hiking as a trio for over 800 miles with Rattler. We talked about what we would have done differently and what Rattler might have done differently too. 
Our afternoon of hiking ended 1 ford and 10 miles later at a lean-to. Rain is coming tonight so we opted for a roof. There were some other people out on their first night of their backpacking trips but no thruhikers. We cuddled up to our favorite guilty please, Queer Eye, and then fell asleep.
In general, there are a lot of feelings going on inside us. This feels like our victory lap in a way and I am looking forward to discovering this place!","ME 15 / Monson

String Cheese & Broken Seal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600918,"Day 136- We made the right decision to stay under a roof- it poured last night. The sound on the roof woke us up but overall, we slept really well. Part of this “enjoy ourselves” mentality translated to me writing a bit in bed before a late 9am start. 
We were still the first ones to be ready but a guy on his first day out asked if he could hike with us for a couple of minutes. Instead, he was with us for miles. He was a nice guy and obviously very excited but we had just said goodbye to our friends so that we could do a lot of reflecting, etc. I think he was unaware of how we were in a completely different mindset than him and it was uncomfortable for us. He was hiking so hard to hang with our moderate pace but eventually he dropped off on the first big climb up Barren Mountain. 
There was a light drizzle and a breeze at the top; enough to make my fingers kind of numb after sitting to eat lunch. While we definitely packed enough food, we probably could have eaten more snacks but our food bags are already overflowing from this long section.
Today supposedly had the hardest terrain of the 100 Mile Wilderness with its steady climbs and descents over Fourth, Three and a Half, Third, and then Chairback Mountain. We took our time and talked a lot about what is ahead. 
We ended up at a tent site near the Lean-to later than anticipated. We had hoped to camp atop one of the later peaks with a view but we didn’t find a great site. We had a nice, quiet evening though and went to bed content with how the day turned out.","Wilson Valley Lean-to
