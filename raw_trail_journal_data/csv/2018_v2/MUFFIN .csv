MUFFIN ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549306,"Been on the trail a few times as a section hiker. First time was back in 2012 when I decided out of the blue to go on an adventure. A.T. was on my mind set at the time. Started from Springer on a cool day March 3rd. Met a few hikers along the way as I hiked through an astonishing scenery. Made a few stops, set up tent in a few shelters and even stayed at a few motels along the way. 2012 I made it pretty far by my standard. Got back on the trail in 2013 only for a few weeks as I section hiked through Virginia and New York. 2014 was the last time I had the opportunity to get back out on the trail but lasted only a month because I tore my quad climbing up Trey Mtn. Looking forward to getting back on the trail hopefully this time around as I'm more fit and lighter with gear I can finish what started back in 2012",,2018 here I come,"Sep 23, Fri",0
MUFFIN ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550384,"I've been thinking lately, we'll these past few weeks on whether I should just take my time this time around on the trail or try to finish it in less than 5 months? It's not like I have anything to look forward to when I finish other than coming back to Florida. Idk, I think once I complete my goal I think I may just hop on a plane and travel to the west coast take a few months off get a job that pays cash and journey onto the PCT",,Just bored,"Oct 12, Wed",0
MUFFIN ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551004,"So far I have ordered some of the most coolest gear that I had the liberty to try out in certain stores. Ordered my baselayers, she'll jacket, tent and accessories from one specific place and I should be getting it sent to my place in the next week or so. I already have my old Jetboil along with my old stix for the hike. Also investing in some Solamon trail shoes as well. I know what to expect once on the trail. I'VE hiked it a few times here and there. I'm so looking forward to meeting everyone out on the trail. I can't wait","Can't wait

MUFFIN ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553965,A year and a month from now I'll be heading to Springer Mtn to embark on a journey again and rekindle my relationship with the trail. Just recently went through a really bad relationship with my partner after buying a house but now I'm just ready to take a few months on the trail to reflect on my life. Hopefully by the time I reach katahdin I'll he able to get back into the groove and enjoy my house a little more.,"
