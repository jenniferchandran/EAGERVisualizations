Quote: ""My obsession with the AT has run its course...""
I guess I misspoke. I'm pretty sure I'm not the first who said, ""No more,"" but changed their mind as the months passed by. I want to return.
So Sunday I will be driving to Gatlinburg and  Monday I will be back on the trail. This will be a section hike to finish the Smokies. Two grandsons, ages 14 and 15, are going to hike with me and we are picking up Journey along the way. Journey is the hiker I met on the trail last year and we hiked together a couple of weeks. We both had knee issues so this will be a trial run to see how it goes.
I debated about reviving my journal for this short hike, but it is a good way to document my hiking for myself. You are welcome to follow along. There are sure to be some adventures!",,View Entry,"Jun 07, Thu",0
Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593491,"Final preparations are being made. 
     Clean the house.     One more Walmart trip.     Grill up some meat for the hubby.     Show him how to water the plants.     One last check of the backpack.     Pack a motel bag.
I'll be picking up the boys at 8 AM tomorrow, heading for Gatlinburg.

We're ready! Hoping for some good sleep tonight.",,View Entry,"Jun 10, Sun",0
Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593739,"In the big bear's backpack! No, we are safe in the shelter and goofing around. They were a big help today and I think they are glad to be here. 
What a day! It's hard to guess our mileage because we took a bypass around Clingman's Dome. I'll have to work on that. 
We weren't on the trail even 20 minutes when Thad started videoing the pretty scenery. All of a sudden he says, ""Oh, it's a bear!"" And yes, a medium sized bear was coming out of the woods. Thad caught it all on video. There were two little cubs and a big mama bear too but I didn't see them. I was busy scaring them all away. 
We are the only ones in the shelter so far. But we expect some mice to show up soon. The Smokies have a lot of rules including no tenting if there is space in the shelter. So we're being obedient. 
My tally:
Bears - 1Falls - 2 (As in I might have to go down these rocks on my bottom... And that's inadvertantly exactly what I did!)","Clingman's Dome

Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594375,"Sleeping was marginal in the shelter the first night. I was cold and could not relax. Lots of shivering. I didn't notice any mice activity, thankfully. 
The boys were great. The second day, the trail was difficult for us women, but the kids just flew over the trail. They would go ahead and then come back to check on us. Go ahead. Come back. Go ahead. Come back. 
At camp, they fetched and filtered water. They set up the tent the second night as the shelter was full and they were happy for their warm, private quarters. It poured down rain for about 30 minutes, but they were tucked in dry..and away from the gnats. 
The gnats! Swarms of them. In your face, around your head. We arrived there about 4:30 PM and I was unable to even look at food, and was in my sleeping bag by 5. It was another cold night in the shelter for me. Journey said she was hot so my shivering may have been related to the way I felt. I was right back in Smoky misery, just like I felt last year in the Smokies. I could not eat. I could not drink and keep it down. It was the beginning of 3 days of hiking without any calories or hydration. Seriously, I was in trouble! The boys saw Grandma in a very vulnerable situation. Being sick on the trail is nasty and humiliating, but they were absolutely wonderful to me. 
They did not know what was ahead for us on Day 3!

Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594453,"Decision. Do I give full disclosure here, or whitewash it a bit? I'll spare you some of the gory details (I was still sick, you know) but nothing went right that day. 
I had gotten into my sleeping bag at 5 PM the night before and didn't get up til morning. The gnats had been horrible at the shelter and in the morning people were covered in big welty bites. I had some, but not as many as others since I had been in my bag most of the time. 
We left the shelter around 8:15 with just 6.1 miles to go for the day. The boys had decided to stick close by me so we could talk while we hiked. Visiting together was a good distraction. It was fun to hear about their friends and teachers, their hopes and dreams. That was the best part of the day. Journey went on ahead of us and hiked alone for the day, giving us time to be together. 
I had been determined to carry my own pack and not abuse the boys' willingness to help me out. But the trail was hard. And I hadn't eaten or kept water down for a couple of days. I was very dehydrated and didn't have much strength. I was also now having diarrhea issues. (Full disclosure, remember.) 
So we hiked, and we hiked, and we hiked. Yes, I stopped a lot. Yes, I had to take off my pack and sit or lay down pretty often, but for the most part we kept moving, on and on. Up and down. Lots of ups. 
Pretty soon it was noon. Then 3:00. We were still going. Then 5:00. I was barely moving by then and the boys were taking turns carrying my pack. They were tired too and ready to be done. 6.1 miles. We had to be getting close soon! 
More people started passing us with concern. They could see I was struggling. They would stop and check on me and then move on. We still had hope we were going to make it to the shelter. It had to be close, right? Only 6.1 miles! 
From about 6:00 on we pushed as hard as we could. Three girls passed us at one point while I was lying down, so sick and exhausted. We told them we were OK and would get to the shelter eventually. The boys and I were pumping each other up, saying at least we would be there by 9...dark time in the woods. 
Hikers started coming past us from the other direction, and apparently I was the talk of the trail. ""Are you the lady having trouble? Are you OK? You better eat and keep drinking!"" 
Yeah, right. I know. 
Well. We hit 9:00 at night and we still weren't there. What was wrong? How could we be so slow? It was just unbelievable. We were nervous and making a plan for finding a place to put up our tent for the night. The problem with that was it was illegal in the Smokies to camp away from the shelters. That wouldn't have stopped me. But the tent barely fits 2 people. The 3 of us would have been almost impossible. And I wasn't splitting up our group. I was responsible for these teenage boys and we were staying together. So we just kept going. 
We knew we were within the last 1/2 mile when I struggled to get up a high step and I fell. My legs just gave out. It was my second fall for the day. We knew the sign to the shelter was very close so the boys went ahead a ways to look for it and I laid there for a moment to recover. I think I even dozed off for a few seconds. All of a sudden I thought, ""Get up! You're laying here on the trail in the dark in bear country!"" I got up and saw the boys coming back. The sign was just ahead! 
I had my headlight and the boys each had the lights on their phones and we huddled together and hiked the last steps into the shelter. It was 10:30 at night. We'd been hiking for 14 hours! How could that be?? 
There were several hikers asleep, but there was space for us and Journey and another man helped us get our beds made and get settled down. 
Again in full disclosure, I confess I am crying now reliving this. I haven't broken down yet the entire trip, but remembering how this all felt is overwhelming. I'm not the big brave hiker people might think. I have big ideas and I am a determined person, but that day was one of the hardest days of my life.","Derrick Knob Shelter

Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594590,"We still had to get off the mountain. Once again, nothing went right. We had a plan: hike down Bote Mountain and meet up with Cousin Chuck so he could drive us back into Gatlinburg. We were to meet him at 1:00.I remembered doing the same thing last year and I insisted it was an easy 4 miles. No hurry. So we left the shelter about 10:15 and started out. Journey shared with me that the 3 girls who had passed me the night before were livid about me. Not concerned. Not caring. Livid! They said I should not be on the trail, that I should not have 2 little kids out there to take care of grandma, etc, etc. They weren't happy with any of the other hikers in the shelter either and were not afraid to speak out.Apparently during the night I had been snoring and one of the girls climbed down from the loft and stood in front of me and shone her bright light at my face. (Sorry, Sweetheart, I didn't wake up.) Seriously, she easily could have jostled me and I would not have been mad. It can be annoying when snoring in a shelter interrupts your sleep. I would have understood.But I digress. We hiked down Bote Mt. Trail and it was not hard, but it was rocky. We hiked until we came to a sign that pointed to Cade's Cove. Did we take it? Nope. I was sure we were to stay on the Bote MT. Trail. By the time I admitted I must have been wrong, we were so far down that it was not practical to retrace our steps. By this time, Journey and I were again beat and so ready to be done. And I was sick about it that Chuck was hiking up the trail to meet us and we were not going to be found. There was zero cell service so there was no way to alert him. It was just another complete screw up.At one point, the boys had gone ahead and Journey and I were sitting down for a quick snack when two ladies passed us. Soon we heard, ""BEAR! BEAR! GO AWAY!"" We looked at each other and said, ""That doesn't sound good! We better get up!"" We walked just a ways down the trail and sure enough a big mama bear and her 2 cubs were walking on the trail toward us. We stood still and quickly got a picture and then yelled at them and clacked our poles and they quickly took off through the woods. We were glad we had heard the others yell and glad we got up or they would have been upon us a lot closer before we saw them. As it was, we were excited to get a glimpse of them with no confrontation.We eventually met up with the boys at the trailhead road {they did not run into the bears). There were cars parked there and we saw a man and woman and their son headed to their little vehicle. I waylaid them and asked if they knew how far it was to Cade's Cove. He checked and said  it was 1.5 miles. So I asked if he could give us a ride. (Now I've got grandchildren hitchhiking!)They were very gracious and after some rearranging and setting up seats and cramming in 4 stinky hikers with their 4 stinky bags, we headed down the road to try to find Chuck. I knew the stink was bad because the poor kid sat next to me with his head practically hanging out the window the whole time. He was not happy! We drove around the parking lot looking for a silver truck with GA license. YES! it was Chuck's truck and just a few seconds later he showed up. He had hiked many miles with very little water and no information on what had happened to us. I felt terrible about it, but he was kind and pleasant as always and if he was mad he covered it up well. My daughter had come to take the boys home. Journey got a flight home for Sunday afternoon, so Friday and Saturday we checked out Gatlinburg. It was very hot, I was about 50% on health and Journey's knees were in pain, but we trudged through it. Sunday I took Journey to the Knoxville airport and I drove the 7.5 hours home. It was over. And it IS over. My hiking desires are fulfilled. I hiked 400+ miles on the trail, most of them beautiful and enjoyable. I will not forget my experiences on the AT. It is a magical place. But I know when to quit. (I know I said that last year but I am now convinced that my hiking days are over. It was a good ride.) Best wishes to all my hiking partners! I will be following you all from the comfort of my couch! Much Love,","Spence Field Shelter
