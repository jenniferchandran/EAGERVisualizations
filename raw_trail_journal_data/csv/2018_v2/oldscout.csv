oldscout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582453,"This should be my first "" real entry. "" I live less than a hour's drive from Springer mountain so I have a great place to train. Not all of my training is on the mountain, I am lucky to have local trails to also use. My training routine consists of hiking, with a loaded backpack, between 30 and 35 miles a week. I started with a 15 lb. pack and am now at 25 lbs. My final weight will be somewhere in the 15 to 18 pound range, depending on the number of days food I carry. Throw in step ups, push ups, pull ups and core work and I hope to be in hiking shape when I start on April 10.Happy Trails",,Home,"Jan 27, Sat",0

oldscout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584000,"25 years ago today 5 Boy Scouts and I set out on the Appalachian Trail for a weekend backpacking trip. Little did we know that the “Storm of the Century“ would turn our 2 day trip into a 7 day epic adventure.
The storm blew in before dark with fierce winds and white out conditions that made it almost impossible to locate the shelter at Springer Mountain. By the time it stopped Saturday nearly 3 feet of snow had fallen across parts of North Georgia and winds whipping to 50 mph blew the snow into nearly waist deep drifts.
When we got to the shelter 2 men and 1 woman were already there. The woman, Karen Berger, was there to interview thru hikers as they started their journey and her husband was in Tennessee to interview the hikers as they got further north.
We set up in the loft area of the shelter, put on all the clothes we had and burrowed into our sleeping bags. The next day the 2 men left to hike north. We later heard they had to be evacuated from the mountains because of hypothermia.
By Monday the storm had stopped, the skies had cleared but it was impossible to go anywhere because of the snow and downed trees. We heard helicopters most of the morning and one helicopter landed in a clearing near us. They said they were helping the State Patrol rescue people and asked us if we wanted a ride out. The boys politely told them they better go find someone who needed help, we were fine.
It was still impossible to get out on Tuesday, and Wednesday, but Wednesday night two Army Rangers from Camp Merrill showed up and said they had orders to remove us from the mountain. The following morning was clear and the Rangers called in a helicopter. We flew to Camp Merrill where the Rangers opened the chow hall and fed us.
The last entry the boys made in the shelter journal read, “ Rangers showed up last night with orders to remove us from the mountain. We all decided since we are outgunned and we don’t want to leave any widows or orphans we will leave peacefully.”
The storm’s snowfall isolated thousands of people, especially in the Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia mountains. The storm paralyzed metro Atlanta and north Georgia for days, the heavy snowfall closing interstates from Atlanta northward. Overall, more than 300 people in 13 different states died because of the storm.We were,                      “Riders of the Storm.""
I hope this adventure I am about to start will be as memorable and I will be able to share it with my great grandkids, 25 years from now.","

People were nice and friendly. Furnished breakfast and everyone helped with meal prep, serving and clean up. No charge for anything, donations accepted but they were not pushy about money.Lots of hikers there, Biscuit, TNT, Jack. Dr. Who, Bean as nd a bunch of others.Neat place. go out the back door to the bus stop. Bus takes you back to the trailhead.","

Four days ago my arm started swelling at the injured point.Three days ago the wound started draining. Yesterday it was still draining so I decided it would be best to have a Doctor look at it. 
The people at the hostel drove me over thirty miles to see the Dr. He said it was infected and prescribed an antibiotic to take, 4 times daily for 10 days.
I'll be back on the trail tomorrow.","

I read the books by the first two men to hike the trail and I read about a dozen more by people who have hiked the trail in the last ten years. I have backpacked extensively most of my adult life. I knew to expect bad weather, bugs, days when nothing seems to go right, physical ailments, equipment problems nothing prepared me for the mountains of New Hampshire. They are scary, a person could get killed on these mountains. When you hear the word trail you think of a path through the forest floor. Not in New Hampshire! In reality you have to climb almost straight up and then back down over boulders. I have to look at every foot placement to minimize the chance of falling. The pace is a slow, slow grind. It is not enjoyable. Sure at the end of the day I am proud of my accomplishment but it is not fun.I have hiked over 845 miles so far and only have about 55 miles left in New Hampshire so there is no chance I will quit but had I known what was waiting in New Hampshire I don't know if I would have started this adventure.","

The climbs were brutal but was rewarded by the views, they are unbelievable. 
Scored 3 work for stay at the huts. Most hikers are lucky to score 1. Guess old age and grey beard played a part in getting WFS.The smoke seen in the background is from the cog railroad taking people to Mt Washington.","

Neither has been a trip stopper. I am surprised at the difficulty of the trails in New Hampshire and Maine. Even with all of the research I did,  I wasn't expecting the trail to be this hard. It has taken a lot of internal dialogue to get me over the challenges of this section of trail. There have been many times I have questioned the safety of the trail. I have met people who have had injuries that have ended their journey. I have less than 230 miles to reach Mt. Katadin and hope I don't have an injury stopping accident.","

It was a 2 hour drive for them.At the hospital xrays showed no broken bones only a sprain. They gave him a brace for his foot and told him to stay off the foot for a few days.We went back to Shaw's to wait a few days to wait and see if his foot gets better. I have hiked with Curb since N H and would like to summit Katahdin with him. If he isn't better after 4 days I will go on without him.","
