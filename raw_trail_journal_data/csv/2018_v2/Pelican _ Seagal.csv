Pelican & Seagal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584909,"We did our last weekend of training before we head to the AT. Got in some stair climbing and hiking with our packs. Now, we have one week left to work. This week is all about cleaning out the fridge and eating our favorite meals “one last time!”  We are getting excited, but still have to finish our last week of work-so we are keeping our excitement contained. Countdown to do list is being checked off as we work thru our final preparations.  T-7 days til we start our trip to GA!",,View Entry,"Mar 25, Sun",0

The only snag was that I discovered my headlamp was corroded inside when I tried to change the batteries on Saturday afternoon. After a quick stop at REI in north Atlanta (is there a such thing as a quick stop at REI) we got to Blue Ridge, Ga. We had a nice dinner and then slept soundly after a couple of crazy busy days getting ready to leave.","

Pelican & Seagal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585572,Today we went to Amicalola State park and officially “registered” with the Appalachian trail conservancy for our hike. We are numbers 1807 & 1808 to start the trail since January. There were stories that over 70 people started yesterday. After registering we drove up the forest road to the parking area on Springer Mountain which is where mile 1  of the trail crosses and where we will be dropped off in the morning. We decided to “backtrack” the one mile to the start of the trail today. So we headed up the trail to the top of Springer Mountain and touched the starting plaque. We sat up there for a little while taking in the views and chatting with people. After a starting pic we officially “started” the trail at high noon! Tomorrow we are hoping to get some miles in before the wind and front comes in-forecasting big wind gusts for the evening! We’ll check in when we get to our first stop at Franklin NC-mile 109.,"

Pelican & Seagal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586087,"We arrived to mile 100 yesterday-Saturday and got a ride into Franklin, NC.   We had busted out 100 miles in 5 days and crossed our first state line from Georgia to North Carolina! The weather had been pretty decent-we got a crazy windy day and a below freezing night on Wednesday, but Friday was the wet day-all day rain that became a downpour all night Friday night-we awoke to fog and continued rain-the forecast was for temps to drop into the teens last night with snow.  Our original plan was to take six days to go to mile to 109 and shuttle off, but the trail was a muddy mess and we decided an early night in town would be super!  Have I mentioned how much we love our Gore-Tex boots!! They have made hiking a dream- no more dirty feet at the end of the day and going thru the “stream” that was supposed to be a trail yesterday was amazing!  The trail is still very much in winter-no greenery yet and very few birds have flown back. The views from the rock outcroppings have been really pretty on the clear days.  We’ve gotten some Trail magic along the way-a  couple of bottles of gator aid that were left in coolers for thru hikers at road crossings and a family that did a “picnic” with hotdogs, sodas, chips, and chairs to sit on. You don’t realize how the little things like having a chair to sit on after so many days  of being on the ground really makes a difference. But that’s what the Trail life is about-taking you back to the basic simple existence and then when you come back to society you appreciate the little things that you’ve  taken for granted in your daily life. Our next stop will be Fontana Village.","Springer Mountain

Pelican & Seagal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586797,"Mile 274We’ve made it to Hot Springs, North Carolina after shuttling around the 70 mile section of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. We preplanned to skip this section due to the ridiculous camping rules whereby the park service mandates that all the hikers must camp only at the shelters. Since all the hikers begin their hikes at this time of year (this is known as the hiker bubble) it causes massive overcrowding at these mouse ridden shelters in the park. We plan to come back at the end of our hike and do this section as two 35 mile day hikes with my dad supporting us. This way we won’t have to stay at the shelters and the park will be green and pretty!  With that plan in place we covered the miles from 100-Franklin, NC to 170-Fontana Dam (the south end of the park) where we stopped for the night. The next morning we were shuttled to Davenport Gap (the north end of the park at mile 240) where we continued to Hot Springs. We had a couple of cold mornings with temps below freezing during this section that gave way to beautiful sunny days.  This section included the incredibly difficult 7.5 mile descent and 7.5 mile continuous ascent at the NOC and “Jacobs Ladder” another aptly named ascent up the spine of a mountain. We went by a beautiful old stone fire tower and then got the most amazing 360 degree views from the top of “Max Patch.”  This is at 4,620 ft and is a huge grass field on the top of the mountain. There is a parking area nearby and so there were people sunning up there with dogs, coolers, families etc-it was surreal!We also got fantastic Trail magic at Fontana Dam-from a sweet older lady-sodas, candy bars, fruit and the best part- luscious homemade brownies!  We are currently enjoying a much needed zero day after covering 104 miles in 5 days while we wait out the winter storm-snow and 40 mph wind gusts forecasted for tonight in the mountains. Our next stop will be Erwin, TN.","

Pelican & Seagal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587489,"Mile 344-Erwin, Tennessee This section we learned that the weather forecast for a town near the trail can be completely different than up in the mountains. We left Hot Springs, NC the morning after the winter storm-which dropped about an inch of rain before turning to snow. It was a really pretty morning with the snow glistening on everything from the bright sunshine. The area around the river only got about a 1/2 inch of snow, but as we climbed up over the mountain to the ridge line there was more snow. Unfortunately, as the snow melted it added more moisture to the wet ground and produced lots of boot sucking, slippery mud. Oh how we love our Gore-Tex, vibram sole boots!  The following day was warm and we enjoyed more bright sun and light winds.  The forecast for Erwin showed continued sun and light winds so we pitched our tent up on a ridge to enjoy the evening breeze. About 9pm the winds picked up and by 11pm we were listening to the trees groaning and branches cracking-hoping that all the trees around us were sound (we always check for dead trees before pitching our tent). By 2am there was some rain and the winds were solidly gusting over 40mph!  By morning there was dense fog to add to the gusting winds. We were 29 miles from Erwin and had planned for a 20 mile day and then 9 into Erwin the following day. As we hiked, the temperature continued to drop and the wind chill was now in the teens-there were times when the wind was so strong it would blow us sideways. We could see down in the valley where the sun was shining. We decided that we would rather push the extra miles and have a warm bed than to spend the night in the cold. We made it to Erwin, cold and exhausted, but happy we dug deep and did the miles. We are resupplying-one of the highlights here is the resident kitty at the post office named “Priority” which is perfect since we send our resupply packages via priority mail. We’ll be heading to our next stop Damascus, VA. The forecast for this next section is calling for lots of rain-glad we’ve got the boots!","

Pelican & Seagal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589060,"After spending a total of nine nights in the infamous town of Erwin, TN known for hanging an elephant in 1916 after it killed its handler, the week long heavy rains and 60 mph winds moved on and we are back trekking north. We did slackpack from Iron Mountain back to Erwin one of the nine days, so we did get in a 20 mile day and had only eight zeros. Zero: a day not hiking on the trailNero: hiking only a few milesSlackpack: basically day hiking, where you don’t carry your tent, etc for overnighting in the woods. Instead (as in this case) we left our overnight camping stuff in the hotel room, a shuttle driver took us north to a spot where the road crosses the trail and we hiked back to town with our hotel room awaiting our return.We finally left Erwin for good with full packs and Damascus VA only about 109 miles away instead of the 126 had we not slackpacked. On our first day out we received trail magic of food and drink at a couple of locations- both were set up by some good folks who had thru hiked last year. We are very appreciative of these kind hearted people who help support and encourage the thru hikers-the sight of them sitting at a Trail head usually brings jubilant tears to our eyes. Day one-the weather was nice all day, but that evening, as forecasted, the temps dropped to a hard freeze and the winds kicked up to around 40 mph. Most of the AT trail is in the woods, occasionally we cross what are known as balds. Balds are nice as you get unobstructed views of the surrounding hills, valleys, etc. However, going over balds in freezing temps and high winds isn’t very pleasant as we experienced this the next morning traversing a couple of miles of balds- just to give you an idea how cold it was-our water bottles formed slushy ice in them. The clear skies provided nice views, but with the wind and cold we hurried along. Temps increased the followings days which is much more to our liking. Spring is finally starting to take hold at some of the lower elevations as we are starting to see more flowers, green leaves, birds, butterflies, chipmunks, etc.  Unfortunately, the weather is supposed to turn on us again-there is a saying on the AT—“no rain, no pain, no Maine”. The southern Appalachians is a temperate rain forest where it will rain at least 1 out of every 3 days. The next section takes us thru the Virginia Highlands which are home to the wild ponies. Our next stop will be Marion, Va.","

Pelican & Seagal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589788,"Mile 570-During this section we went through Grayson Highlands and got to see the ponies!  They are about chest high with beautiful manes and tails and  really friendly. We also saw some long horn cows in the area grazing on the scrub brush. A 50k Trail race was being run and so we got to yell “good job” to all the runners as we hiked along. It thundered throughout the day and night, but the rains held off until 4am the next morning when the heavens opened up.  After a couple of hours it stopped and we packed up and hit the muddy trail. The rains returned that afternoon and made for some slow going as we slipped away on the mud. Luckily, the Mt Rogers visitors center wasn’t too far and we got a ride into Marion to dry out. We spent a couple of days in Marion doing some slack packing. We went through a really pretty area that was full of fragrant blooming bushes and lots of bumblebees-it’s nice to be on the lower elevation mountains of 3000 feet versus the brown 5000 foot mountains. We also have come to the fence stiles-these are wooden ladder type apparatuses that you have use to climb up and over the barbed wire fences. These are real fun with a pack on your back! We got to have some Trail magic at a historic school built in 1894-very cool. We will be heading next to Pearisburg, Va.","

Pelican & Seagal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590577,"We walked by the 600 mile marker along the trail and made it to Pearisburg Va, mile 635.   Fortunately we had reserved a room in town in advance as both of the hotels were sold out.   We chose to stay at the Plaza hotel, which is a very clean place, but certainly not to be confused with the Crown Plaza hotel chain.   The manager Linda is super nice and gave us a ride to and from Walmart when the only local shuttle driver wasn’t available and we didn’t want to walk another 5 miles RT carrying all our resupply items-after slack packing 24 miles earlier in the day.  Our town days are zero Trail miles, but we are still on foot for all our errands—grocery resupply, post office, laundry and meals. They are definitely not relaxing days where we get to recover from our multiple 20+ miles/day of hiking. 
Lots of the flowers are blooming and the temps are rising to the upper 80s/low 90s.    Water sources are still running, but many of the springs are getting small.   Bugs are out in full force and we spotted our first tick of the hike.    Picked up some bug juice we’ll be using going forward.
Heading out tomorrow with forecasted thunderstorms for several days.   Next planned stop is Daleville Va.","

Pelican & Seagal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591790,"Mile 729. We made it to Daleville, Va after all the torrential rains passed. There had been so much rain, that the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC)-the group that oversees the trail-made a statement about the trail conditions and urged hikers to beware of flooded areas and downed trees. When we got back on the trail we saw signs of flash flooding along the trail, but luckily the ground had been dry before the rains.  Even though the trail was muddy and we had to ford some of the creek crossings, overall it wasn’t as bad as it could have been. In this section we went by the area where the Mountain Valley Pipeline is going in. There were some protesters there including a couple of people who had been living up on platforms in the trees for 70 days. Speaking of trees, we went past the “Keffer Oak” which is a very large oak tree that is over 300 years old-it is an amazing site to see!  We also did the “triple crown” of Virginia-the Dragons tooth, McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs. The dragon’s tooth is an interesting area that has a fair amount of rock scrambling-complete with rebar ladders to climb down the face of the rock. This is a favorite area for day hikers, but it is completely different going down the rock walls as a thru hiker with a full back pack!  McAfee knob and Tinker cliffs have very nice views of the ridges and valleys in the area and we enjoyed breaks at both places. This section, the rocks on the trail increased too-we jokingly say that “Virginia is for rock lovers”.  We got new hiking shoes-no more Goretex boots-the temperature and high humidity has made them unbearable to wear-besides the fact that after 600+ miles they were more than worn out. The new shoes have made the rocks much easier to hike over which is definitely something to be thankful for. The warm weather and sunshine has also brought out the snakes. We saw our first copperhead of the hike too on this section.  The “green tunnel” is in full effect now as the trees are full of leaves and the undergrowth has filled in-the shade is nice, but without the breeze it can get stifling. We are starting to get up even earlier to to try to get our mileage in to avoid some of the late afternoon heat. We are keeping an eye on tropical storm Alberto, hoping that it doesn’t bring more flooding rains to the area. Our next stop will be Buena Vista, Va.","

Pelican & Seagal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592291,"Mile 807This last section was like walking through a rainforest. We left Daleville knowing that the tropical moisture was working its way up to us in Virginia.  Unfortunately, the tropical moisture brought 100% humidity with it-no sun and not even the slightest breeze so the moisture from the previous days rain never evaporated.  The morning we left Daleville the temp was in the low 70’s and it was cloudy with 100% humidity-we were drenched with sweat in less than 5 minutes.  By the afternoon the rains came back and it was a 2 hour downpour that we walked in-the trail became a stream bed. We got to our spot to camp and had to stand in the rain and wait until it calmed a bit to put the tent up. Our clothes were drenched in sweat and rain and we hopefully hung them up on a rope line to dry after the rain ended that evening. Needless to say they weren’t any drier the next morning. We put on soaking wet clothes and shoes and continued on- it wouldn’t have mattered if they were dry because it was so wet everywhere and with the humidity we would have been soaked in no time. The forest had literally become a true rainforest-the trees and bushes were saturated and dripped water all day-no sun or breeze. The footing was slick with the wet rocks and mud. Thunder surrounded us the entire afternoon as we trudged on- we made it to our next planned site and set the tent up before the rains started-it rained all night. At 3:30am it stopped and we checked the radar seeing that we had a window of a few hours before another big rain cloud came. 28 miles and a few mountains was all that separated us from the next town-so we packed up and decided we were going for it!  The rains came back but we didn’t care because we were going to be dry-our prune feet just might have the chance to be normal again!Over the past 78 miles we went over the James River bridge (a 600 foot long pedestrian only  bridge), went by remnants of a freed slave village, saw lots of mushrooms and had cold drinks that had been left in coolers on the trail -very welcome trail magic! As a side note-it turns out that this is the wettest May in history for Central and Northern Virginia.","

Pelican & Seagal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592840,"Mile 889We made it into Shenandoah National Park despite the continued rains that have dropped between 1-5 inches of rain every day for the last couple of weeks. To say that the Trail is a muddy mess would be an understatement and the easy stream crossings are challenging fordings as the ground is completely saturated and each successive days rain has had no where to go. The views have been nonexistent as we have been surrounded in thick fog too-it’s been almost surreal. The good news is that we are supposed to be getting a break in the next few days so hopefully things will return to normal soon!  We have seen our first bears of the trip-4 total: 3 of them yesterday. It was like the three little bears-one was full grown, one was a medium size and the other was a small youngster. We’ve also seen more deer and LOTS of frogs, salamanders and snails. Also, the mountain laurels have thrived in this wet weather and the woods are full of their beautiful white flowers. We haven’t been able to take many pictures due to the rainy days- the camera has been safely tucked away from the rain in the backpack. Shenandoah National Park is a special section of the Appalachian Trail. It has more animals, a nice maintained trail, it crosses the Skyline drive around 40 times so you get views and it has the waysides where you can get the blackberry milkshakes!  Now all we need is a little sunshine and all will be perfect!","

Pelican & Seagal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593963,"Mile 1025Sunshine, glorious sunshine!  The skies cleared and the temperature and humidity dropped. We had a couple of cool days with temps only in the low 60’s and into the 50’s at night-it felt like we had gone straight to fall!  But, we finally got to see the views from the overlooks in Shenandoah National Park. The Trail goes right through the park, past the campgrounds and waysides (restaurants). We camped one night in one of the campgrounds where we saw a few more bears, had a deer bed down in our tenting area and had a middle of the night visit from some wild boars. We also spent a night at the Skyland Hotel-a beautiful room with a gorgeous view down to the Shenandoah valley-we felt like real tourists. We visited the waysides along the way eating the famous blackberry ice cream-yes we even had some with breakfast one morning!  Besides the bears and deer we had a really awesome experience with a family of barred owls. We came upon an adult pair calling to each other on our last afternoon we got some great pictures and then realized that there were 3 youngsters in trees around us. We got more beautiful pictures and then continued on down the Trail.  We bid the park goodbye as we headed into Front Royal, Va. where we did a resupply. The Trail from Front Royal to Harpers Ferry was at best “sloppy” to coin a horse racing term. This section has LOTS of chronic drainage problems that were made even worse by all the rains-footing at best was slick and there were lots of ‘mud wallowing” areas.  It’s pretty sad to see the continuous soil erosion from poorly planned trail building. The highlight of this section was another owl encounter we had with two small screech owls-they were sitting in trees right by us and gave us the opportunity for some more great pictures.  We crossed the Virginia/West Virginia border after 550 long miles in Virginia and arrived in Harpers Ferry as a cool front brought in more rain and low temps. We checked in with the ATC and registered in as hikers #727 & #728 to arrive in Harpers Ferry. We head on to Maryland and Pennsylvania next.","

Pelican & Seagal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594804,"Mile 1156 This section we crossed quite a few milestones.  We crossed the halfway point so we have now gone further than we have left to hike!  We crossed the Mason-Dixon Line and we have gone thru West Virginia and Maryland. Unfortunately that means we are in Pennsylvania-or should I say Rocksylvania as it’s known on the Appalachian Trail!  This is the state that at only 229 miles “eats” a new pair of shoes-shredding them so they need replacement. We have been going over rocks since Damascus, Virginia and couldn’t imagine how it could get worse. Here the rocks are more pointed, don’t have anyway not to walk on them and they go on for long, long stretches-bruising the bottoms of feet. Also, for fun, they throw in real big boulder piles that you must climb and rock hop over for long stretches. The kind of piles where you stand there in disbelief that they actually are routing the Trail thru this stuff!  The good news is that we are moving forward and hope to be out of Rocksylvania by the end of June!  The section we just completed is full of civil war history and we’ve walked past some of the battlefield areas and historic markers. It was pretty amazing to imagine all of them fighting up on the rocky ridge lined forests. Pennsylvania is a rural farmland section that has narrow tree covered rocky ridges that we stay up on for long stretches of time-so we don’t have the constant uphills and downhills of the previous states, but the trade off is the rocks. The weather has gotten warm-we are finally into summer and the bugs have come out in full force. The other evening at our tent site there was a strange constant hum that we eventually realized was the bugs!  We are looking forward to seeing what’s in the next section.","

Pelican & Seagal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595425,"Mile 1271This section the Pennsylvania Trail routers ramped up the rocks even more!  They say that Pennsylvania will crush your dreams and we can see how the nonstop onset of rocks in a never ending, monotonous green tunnel without any views could easily do that. Our daily mileage of 23-26 miles hasn’t changed, but we have had to work hardest and walk longer hours due to the fact that the “brutal” rocks have you picking and scrambling your way at a much slower pace. There is no way to explain how difficult it is both physically and mentally to navigate the miles upon miles of boulder fields. We honestly can’t understand the people that routed the Trail. How can you with good conscience, route a trail thru this stuff? You know people are carrying heavy packs making them unbalanced. Why are you risking injuries or worse?  What makes it even more maddening is as we pick our way along we can see that a little further down the ridge is a less dangerous area that could easily accommodate the trail - it baffles the mind. We have 24 miles left in Rocksylvania and then we will gradually see the rocks abate for awhile. We did have a porcupine sighting- the poor guy was trying to navigate down off of some boulders and we watched as he hesitantly would stick his arm out and then pull it back- fearful of falling. We wanted to help him so badly!  Eventually, he made his move and fell- rolling down the boulders. He stood up a little stunned and waddled off. That is how I feel on the rocks-one bad move and....!  Speaking of- Ken and I each have broken one of our trekking poles-my pole snapped in half as it caught me during a fall on the rocks. The sections we just climbed thru were “pulpit rocks”, “pinnacle”, “knife’s edge”, “bake oven knob” and “the superfund site”. As we have gotten further and further into the rocks the amount of hikers on the trail have dwindled down considerably. We went an entire day without seeing any other thru hikers and a man doing Trail magic before the superfund site said we were the only thru hikers he had seen all day. We aren’t sure if people are slowing way down, have quit or are skipping these sections; but it is eerie to not see anyone. We are heading to New Jersey next.","

Pelican & Seagal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596954,"Since the last post we have gone thru the rest of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. The rocks never went away- the flat ridge lines of Pennsylvania changed to what I call “rock piles with dirt ” —they aren’t even mountains-just 500-1000 ft knobs. Instead of the trail meandering around these or up a route that would make sense to anyone-they chose to paint the white blazes right up them, circle the small rocky top and then down the other side and repeat with the next one. This was the area we were hoping to be able to do more daily miles- instead it got slower. The incessant rocky terrain, the climbing up and down and general lack of any true “walking” has made it impossible to get any momentum going.  We had visits from friends: TJ and Caitlin came and took us to dinner and helped us slack one day—Justin gave up an entire weekend to help us slack thru New York.  These were such wonderful, caring moments by true friends and it was great to see them!
We had a huge aha moment just recently-during a town resupply.  We were eating at a restaurant and the waitress asked us what our favorite part of the trail had been so far.  We paused, thinking-she innocently prompted us saying “I’m sure there are so many- just name a few if you can’t decide on only one.”  Unfortunately, the opposite was true- we couldn’t think of any part of the trail that was actually worthwhile-Ken finally replied “Every town we go to.”  And that simple exchange got us thinking-we had chosen to do this to spend the time together-enjoying the outdoors and the challenge of hiking. We knew the trail wouldn’t be easy, but we didn’t appreciate that most of the trail is just following blazes that someone painted- not an actual “trail” - that the blazes defy common sense and almost appear as if they were painted as a joke. The daily struggle mentally and physically to not get seriously hurt has been tough. Unfortunately, a couple of days ago while climbing up a rock pile I tweaked my knee-walking is slowed, but the ability to climb up and down the erratic rocks is greatly limited. This has led to long discussions about what’s important. Is completing a goal that isn’t enjoyable worthwhile just to say you did it and didn’t quit? Is pride worth it? Does it matter what other people think?What is important in life? How do you want to spend the precious time you have on earth and with whom? These are all valid questions that everyone has in their daily lives, but few actually face them head on and answer them. When you are removed from the influx of the world and only have your thoughts these questions and many others echo in your head. I realized that the most important thing in my life is my family. That doing “epic” things are only worthwhile if they are enjoyable and that there is a finite amount of time to do things and it’s not worth wasting time on things that don’t make you happy. So, with those thoughts, making a decision about my knee was easy and we have decided that we are going to take the rest of our time this summer and spend it with our families. We are only sad that we didn’t come to this realization earlier-we would have done so many things differently. We are proud of the 1500 miles we walked, climbed and crawled through difficult terrain and the lessons we learned along the way. Now it’s time to take the things we learned and plan our next adventure!","
