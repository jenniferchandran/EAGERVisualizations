Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/477938,"With 2014 coming to a rapid close, I figured now is as good a time as any to start up our journal for 2015. Unfortunately, we are not able to make any extended hikes, but the plan is to hike the Great Smoky Mountains portion of the AT. Curly has sufficiently recovered from our thru hike of the Foothills Trail, and I promised a zero day in Gatlinburg halfway thru this coming adventure. With the promise of banjo music and a feather bed to sleep on at least one night...Curly is ""all in!""So now begins the preparation, and we officially kicked that off by hiking to Raven Cliff Falls, located at Cesar's Head state Park in upstate SC. It was a beautiful crisp fall day, in the lower 50's and sunny. Hiking was moderately strenuous, nothing compared to our September hike. Of course, the difference between humping 25 lbs and 5 lbs is huge! The only challenge was not busting our keister on the trail where leaves had covered up roots and rocks. In some places it was like pushing through drifts!We ended taking 4 different trails to get to our destination...and with an entire day to get it done, we lounged through a total of 8.5 miles. Curly picked Italian for a carb loaded dinner afterwards, and we both called it a successful day.",,Raven Cliff Falls,"Nov 07, Fri",0
Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518545,"2015 was a year in which good intentions degraded into poor execution. After completing the Foothills Trail in September 2014 and chronicling that hike in Trail Journals, It was my intention to continue journaling in 2015 as Curly and I made plans for hiking the AT section of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Yeah, right, and you can see how that worked out! I did not continue journaling at all, and the Smokies never got hiked by this dynamic duo.And although the Smokies hike did not materialize, we did have an incredible year on various trails. During 2015, we did hike 4 different sections of the Foothills Trail; two trails in Pisgah National Forest (we highly recommend Cat Gap Loop); 1 beautiful hike in the mountains of Jamaica; 3 different sections of the AT, which I will journal about later on; and lots of short hikes in the Columbia, SC area. We squeezed in hikes as often as our schedules would allow.All that to say that now by establishing this 2018 journal, we are publicly committing ourselves to this thru hike and the scrutiny of you the reader. I know how that goes, as I am an avid reader of Trail Journals and as readers of TJ know, there are as many discarded journals as their are well intentioned hikers who had grand plans for epic hikes...only to fall into the abyss of ""coulda-woulda-shoulda"". I'm believing that posting now, 27 months in advance of our hike, this will provide a layer of accountability which will solidify our commitment and entertain you. Only time will tell!","

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518548,"Curly and I are excited about 2016 and all the possibilities a new year might bring. We celebrate 35 years of marital bliss in May, and what better way to celebrate than a hike through Shenandoah National Park? We are scheduling that for early May, and in mid-August we are traveling to Michigan to celebrate my Dad's 80th birthday, and while there, will hike 42 miles of the Lakeshore Trail along Lake Superior. I can't wait to see the Pictured Rocks...lots of childhood memories.Around those two big hikes will be lots of shorter weekend hikes, one of which I hope to be the Art Loeb Trail in Pisgah National Forest. This trail passes through two wilderness areas which do not allow trail markings or blazes...meaning I need to do some serious brushing up on my map and compass skills.Curly is jonesing for a weekend winter hike...I haven't agreed to that one yet, as Curly is not nearly as much a fan of winter weather as she fashions herself to be! I know I'm not, but I suppose if we are going to begin our thru hike on April1st, the we better get ourselves ready for some winter hiking. Bottom line is that 2016 is shaping up to be a great year of prepping as we look to 2018.","

Faith and family at the top of that list, followed by good health and wonderful friendships.

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518828,"In just a little more than 4 months, Curly and I will be hiking Shenandoah National Park, from Front Royal (northern entrance) all the way down to Rockfish Gap (southern entrance). Being the planning kind of guy I am, I decided to take Curly on a road trip, and we spent today on a recon mission of sorts. Driving up to Waynesboro the previous day, we spent this morning figuring out where we would leave the car for a week as we get shuttled up north for the drop in Front Royal.Besides meeting incredible people in both locations, we also got to actually check out the trailheads in both south and north entrances. How crazy is it that in less than 2 hours we can visit two locations that are over a hundred miles apart? Even crazier is that it will take us about a week to do this by foot in the spring.I know the hike will be more fun than I could ever expect, but actually checking out the trail in advance stokes me up big time.   There is something absolutely magical about the AT...and just being in its presence stirs up feelings of excitement and anticipation. It is these brief moments that will carry me over the next two plus years as I await my turn to hike the green tunnel.","

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519161,"Reminiscing on the past year, Curly and I were discussing easiest and hardest hikes of the year. For me, without any doubt, our 3 days hiking the White Mountains on the AT in late June takes the cake.We were heading to Maine for a family reunion over the July 4th weekend, and figured while we were in the area, why not get in a few days in the Whites? So I began the planning in earnest, and we decided that the highlight of our trip would be hiking Franconia Ridge, from Liberty Spring Campsite to Garfield Ridge Campsite, a little more than 7.5 miles on our second day. The first and third days would be taking other trails in and out. I called Lafayette Campground in advance of the trip and was advised to plan on reducing our daily hiking distance by a third of normal for us.I had no clue how good that advice would be. If you are unfamiliar with the Whites, all I can say to you is ""Holy Shnikees""! Ups that never end, no switchbacks, hand over hand climbing (hiking sticks are worthless, at least in this section) and the weather made it that much more dangerous. I foolishly thought we could out hike the weather forecast, which called for thunderstorms in the afternoon. I figured an early start and we could get above and beyond tree line with no problem. Yeah, right.It was raining immediately upon setting off. We hiked through the rain and as the temps dropped, I began to worry. My fear was hypothermia, especially for Curly, so I wouldn't let her stop to rest...concerned she wouldn't get back up. When we got above tree line, we realized we were in deep doo doo. The weather got progressively worse and the fog settled in. I have only feared for my life twice in my 55 years...this was one of those times. We had a difficult time seeing the blazes, and one wrong turn would send us off the edge. Over Little Haystack, on to Mt. Lincoln, and up to Mt. Lafayette we hiked, one foot in front of the other, and praying every step of the way. By the time we reached the other side of Mt. Garfield, it had taken 8 hours to hike less than 8 miles!We stumbled in to Garfield Ridge Campsite soaked, frozen and in need of sustenance. That shelter never looked so good. And although it was packed with hikers riding out the weather, we squeezed in, got into dry camp clothes and heated up some hot drinks. Made some new trail friends that evening and learned two important lessons. First, never try to outfox Mother Nature...she is way more clever and far more unforgiving. Second, and I know you all have read this or experienced it...but the only way to get in shape to hike the trail is to hike the trail! The gym, road walks, Zumba...doesn't matter, they don't make up for 8-10 hours of non stop hiking with 25 pounds on your back.Next post, something a little lighter and not quite so harrowing!","

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519508,"So in the interest of providing equal time, it's only fair to recap what was probably the most enjoyable time on the trail last year. For me, and I think Curly as well, it was the section of AT between Sam's Gap and Uncle Johnny's in Erwin, TN.It was our anniversary weekend (34 years) and we hiked three days. Amazing weather with zero rain, cool mornings, and expansive views. The picture you see is the top of Big Bald, an incredible location with 360 degree sight lines. It was there that we met thru hiker Carver and later Balto. We also met Hiccup who was hiking to Harper's Ferry. Throughout our three days, the time spent during the day on the trail, enjoying the rejuvenating moments within God's creation completely sold us both on committing ourselves to thru hiking sooner rather than later. The desire to hike all 2185 miles of the AT while we had our health really drives us to hike sometime in the next couple of years. This long weekend sealed the deal for us.Besides meeting incredible people on the trail, the total social experience of the AT is something you can only fully understand by being being there. Community is instantly created, and from our observations, everyone is an equal, everyone has a story, and everyone seems to enjoy one another immensely. Obviously this isn't completely true at all times, but there is something different going on out on the trail. Curly and I certainly look forward to getting out there and immersing ourselves in it.We wrapped up our anniversary weekend by staying the night at Uncle Johnny's...what a cool guy! For an old geezer like me, the fact that he had a dog named Jerry Garcia won me over. We look forward to staying there again. We can't wait to begin our journey...","

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520183,"So, every hiker has their own opinions about trail food. To cook or not to cook? Dehydrate your own or buy pre packaged? Rice or noodles...or instant mashed potatoes? Spam or Tuna? Spend enough time on the trail, and you'll discover as many opinions as their are mosquitoes!For me, I'm a creature of habit, and that means once I land on a particular meal, I hate to try different things...kind of like the old saying, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" As a result, I have three meals that I will recommend, and no, I have not received any benefits or compensation from the makers of these fine gastronomic delights. Here they are, in order of preference: 1. Mountain House Chili Mac with Beef. When Curly and I hiked the Foothill Trail in September 2014, honest to goodness this meal saved our trip, and possibly our marriage. After a long day of close to 17 miles, a good chunk of it in the rain, and a few other unfortunate experiences, Curly was ready to call it quits...with tears in her eyes, for the third time that day, she wanted to go home. I convinced her that if we ate a hot meal and got a good nights sleep, she would feel differently in the morning. And she did. She would say it was the sleep...I say it was the incredibly delicious dinner.2. Close second is Mountain House Beef Stew...my goodness, this stuff is hot, beefy awesomeness! I love the rich beef flavor, and it always taste great hot or cold (just sayin'). The only down side is that Mountain House meals are not inexpensive, but they are filling.3. Trader Joe White Cheddar Mac n Cheese with Spam Single. No matter what you might think about Spam, just dress it up with some Mac n cheese, especially white cheddar. As my dad would say...""ambrosia""!So there you have it, Force Flex's culinary favorites...definitely will be taking them on the trail this year!","

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521424,"I love the quote on today's picture. I cannot take credit for either picture or saying, but wholeheartedly agree with the sentiment. And while there are many things in this life more important than hiking (at least for me), being in the outdoors with everything owned carried on my back is a hugely fulfilling and wonderful feeling. Most definitely better than ""just"" paying bills.It is inspiring to read the journals of those hikers already on the trail. I admire their tenacity and independent spirit. Hiking in the winter is not for the faint of heart, and I wish for them all safe hiking and warm endings to their challenging days. Thank you for bringing today's quote into sharp focus","

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523436,"The older I get, the greater concern I have about my body being able to withstand the rigors of a thru hike. I turn 56 this year and am currently planning on a 2018 hike...leaving at 57 and finishing at 58. No big deal, right? Well, I wonder...does one year, or two, for that matter make that much of a difference? I consider myself to be in pretty decent shape. I work out regularly, eat pretty healthy, watch the processed foods and sugars, etcetera etcetera. But the body, it's getting older, and just falling out of my comfy bed each day is becoming more of a chore. So what to do?I'm thinking maybe it's possible to get somewhat ahead of the body decaying process if I take this hike in 2017, essentially move up the hike by a year. Lots of details to work out, but seriously, my fear is that if I don't pull the trigger now, I won't be physically able to later. Anybody out there face a similar dilemma and move their hike up a year? I'd love to hear from you.","

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528858,"When I think of important characteristics that a hiker really benefits by possessing, right at the top is ""flexibility"". You know, that capacity for not getting too bent out of shape when things rapidly fly out of your control? The willingness to take in stride sudden, unexpected changes in your plans? That inner sense of being ok with taking whatever the trail sends your way? For me, I believe that flexibility is a continued journey or process in my life because I am a person who craves total control. And in the hiking world, I am the LAST person with control. Weather, trail conditions, unforseen circumstances, family issues, yada yada...all take precedence. Last year, the plan was to hike the Smoky's...we ended up section hiking in the Erwin area and a bit of the White's in NH. This year, we were all set to hike Shenandoah NP, and some family news has completely altered those plans. Such is life. The good news is that we still get out to enjoy God's creation and the solitude of the woods. It will just have to be ""somewhere other"" than what was originally planned.As we used to say in the military...""Semper Gumby"" (Always Flexible!)","

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529191,"The Trail Is Calling…day 1 With great excitement and our respective packs full, Curly Turtle and I finally got out of town and into the woods. For the past 2 years I have been wanting to hike the Caesar’s Head spur trail to Sassafras Mountain. This trail is an alternative beginning to the Foothills Trail of South Carolina, essentially an optional first leg if you are traveling from east to west/north to south. It is a 14.2 mile hike one way, and the Foothills Guide describes it as “strenuous”. That certainly didn’t matter to me – I just wanted to get outside and on the trail. We decided to do an out and back over two and a half days. Being that we had not hiked with packs since late summer 2015 (about 6 months), I wasn’t sure how trail ready our legs would be. Parking and registering our vehicle at the State Park main office, we got out on the trail around 1130am and headed towards Raven Cliffs Falls. With our packs ranging between 18-25 pounds, both Curly Turtle and I weren’t sure about the weather and didn’t want to take any chances. We had cold and warm weather gear. Good thing we had both, because the daytimes were sunny, warm and beautiful. The evenings got chilly, although I don’t believe they were as cold as Curly Turtle thinks it was. The first three hours were amazing, with very little elevation change and a well worn trail. We averaged almost 2.5 miles per hour and even Curly Turtle was making great time! After those first 7 plus miles and a nice long lunch, the rest of the day slowed down considerably. Being that it was our first backpacking trip in many months, we both began to feel the miles at around 10. The terrain and elevation had significant shifts upward, and with very few switchbacks, we couldn’t catch a break…it was simply straight up. We decided we would hike until 430pm, cook dinner and evaluate our next move. By then we had covered ten miles. We stopped at a beautiful campsite with a great water source, ate some hot beef stew and took off our shoes.  Much to my surprise, Curly Turtle suggested we go a couple more miles, which would make our quest for Sassafras that much closer the next day. So we packed up and hiked an additional hour, about 2 more miles. At the 12 mile point for the day, we were definitely dragging our tails, so a cozy little spot off the trail was identified, we pitched the new REI Quarterdome 3 (more about in another post) and called it a night. All in all, we were sore but content. It sure is wonderful to be back on the trail again!","

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529193,"The fact that spring is here on the calendar does not mean that it has actually arrived. The trees have not yet fully bloomed, which is actually great for hiking, because there is just enough green to soothe the eyes, but the views are not quite yet obstructed. We had plenty of awesome views the day before, and I was thinking we would get more of the same today…I was not disappointed. It is also great sleeping weather if you like a little nip in the air, which I do. Curly Turtle on the other hand, like her name implies is not quite as warm blooded. She has the blood temp of an amphibian like her name sake. And because she did not pack long underwear, it made for a long night. We got ourselves up around 630am and were on the trail by 7, opting to hike to Sassafras and eat our breakfast there. I would love to start each day that way, simply packing up and taking off, then eating a bit later, but the lesson learned in this is that Curly Turtle (CT) is slow enough without depriving her of her morning sustenance. It took us an hour and a half to travel 2.2 miles, and I determined then that from now on, we would have our hot coffee and breakfast before getting on the trail. We enjoyed the views at Sassafras, got our caffeine and turned ourselves around for the trip back. Part of me was glad to be halfway done, part of me was not looking forward to some of the brutal hiking terrain that we had encountered later in the previous day. This trail is interesting because as I mentioned before, the first 5-6 miles were deceptively easy, which allowed us to get a bit cocky. It proceeded to toughen up over the remaining miles, but going back, was difficult not because we were going up, but because we were going down I’m convinced that the pull of gravity going down takes a greater toll on my body than fighting gravity when going up. Either way, we knew we had the entire day, plus the next morning, so we pushed on, but savored the beauty of the day as well. We decided that we would do another 12 miles or so, which would leave us about 5.5 miles from the car on Saturday. We also had noted some great camp sites along water the day before, and set our sights on those locations. The day warm, not a cloud in the sky, and I was grateful for simple things like a hat and cold, filtered mountain water. We hiked through the rest of the day and hit our campsite around 5pm. Set up our camp, ate some amazing Trader Joe’s White Cheddar Mac n Cheese with a Spam slice (you gotta eat it to believe it…ambrosia!), then settled in for the night. I gave CT my long johns to wear, which I wasn’t wearing anyways, and her second night was much more comfortable than the previous one.

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529194,"Final Day and a Couple of Thoughts Saturday morning was just as beautiful and brisk as the previous day. With the sun coming up over on the other side of the mountain, getting CT out of her sleeping bag was no easy task. With a fresh, hot cup of coffee and a breakfast bar, she was soon rising and shining. We packed up our gear and set out around 8am. With only four and a half miles to hike, and knowing that the terrain was pretty easy, we didn’t feel the pinch of having to hurry. The day just kept on getting nicer and nicer. The closer we got back to civilization, the more day hikers began to appear. Up to then, we hadn’t seen a soul on the trail. Now, with just a couple of miles to go, folks were out in force, and it was wonderful to see. Sure beats watching the boob tube. We made it back to the parking lot where our vehicle was around 1045am. Hopped in the car and headed home. Overall, a successful trip having hiked 28.4 miles, plus the mile or so in addition when I got off trail the day before. Yeah, I didn’t write about that, but I will say it’s the first time that has ever happened, and boy does it get the adrenaline pumping! Couple of pieces of gear I want to talk about. First, we upgraded from an REI Dash 2 to an REI Quarterdome 3. The weight differential is 12 ounces (3lbs to 3lb 12oz), and while that may seem substantial, for the first time ever, I split the tent up and had CT carry the fly and footprint (piece of Tyvek). So in actuality, I carried a bit less and she carried a bit more. But the size factor is what made this tent so special. It is a legitimate 3 person tent, and there is room to bring everything in from the outdoors. It circulates air well, and we both were quite comfortable. I have to seam seal it yet, and it hasn’t been tested in the rain, but if it is anything like the Dash 2, it will be a winner. Second item is our new sleeping pads. We’ve been using Big Agnes Q Core pads for 2 years now, and there is a lot to like. But…weight and time it takes to inflate are huge drawbacks. So after research, I took a shot at the Klymet Static V and can say that I love, love, love it! Weighs 8 ounces less than the Big Agnes, and only takes 11 breaths to fill up! For those who know what its like to hike all day and have to exert 25-30 breaths on a sleeping pad know what I’m talking about. The other thing is that the Static V is not as noisy as the crinkling sound of the Big Agness when you are flopping around on it at night. I highly recommend after one weekend on the trail. All that being said, we are gearing up for our next trip, which is in early May when we do a section of the AT around Hot Springs. Haven’t decided the route or mileage yet, but we have 6 nights, so looking at an “out and back”. Stay tuned!","Campsite

Yes indeed, the silence has indeed been deafening, and hiking opportunities have been far and few between. I have journaled before about the flexibility that is required in life. That we really do not have as much control over our circumstances as we would like to believe, and these past 60 days have continued to reinforce this truth.

Our backup is to hit the AT in the Hot Springs area in early July, and looking forward to three days of silence and solitude (of the other kind).
No matter how often or how little hiking we get to enjoy, the fact remains that hiking simply gets in your blood! At least for us, we think about it, read about, talk about it and even once a while, get out and do it. And it is a joy to read the journals of so many who are out there right now.

Neither of us have ever been to Hot Springs, so our excitement grew as each mile drew us closer to town.Arriving late in the afternoon, we went directly to Elmers and a sticky note welcoming us in and informing us of our room met us at the door. No security codes or card keys necessary in this charming inn! We unpacked, and with Elmer out running errands, we decided to get a bite to eat. For a small town, wow the options were amazing and plentiful. Eenie meenie miney moe, the Iron Horse it was...boy was it delicious! Awesome ambience and super friendly folks, we were really beginning to enjoy our stay.Returning to Elmer's, he greeted us at the door and invited us to move about the house. Such a charming place, with so much to look at, a feast for the eyes! But, what caught my attention was a poem Earl Shaffer wrote many many years ago, and sent a copy of the poem to Sunnybank Inn. Earl stayed at the Inn during his 1948 thru hike, and again in 1998. While we did not get to sleep in the same room as Mr. Shaffer, we did rest our tired heads down with great satisfaction knowing that we were in the midst of hiker history, and eagerly looked forward to our next 3 days.","

With a fairly easy grade and extremely well kept trail, we flew down the trail, stopping at Roaring Fork Shelter for lunch and cruising into our destination by 330pm.We got our tent set up and finished camp chores, in the process meeting hikers Brandon, Nakisha and June. Ate dinner and got ready for a quiet night, celebrating our nations independence in the solitude of the forest. At least, we thought so.About 930pm, having been in the sack a couple hours, I heard what I thought was thunder, and then a cracking noise like a tree falling in the woods...very close. I got out of the tent and flashed my headlamp in the general direction of the noise. What I saw was...new campers setting off fireworks in the middle of the forest! I couldn't believe what I was seeing and was angry that they would risk starting a forest fire by playing with fireworks. I flashed my headlamp at them but not knowing how many were in the group or knowing whether they were in any condition to be talked to, opted to not confront them. While no fires resulted from their foolishness, in retrospect I should have said something, and regret that. Turns out that it was a dad, mom and two boys. Could have been a teaching moment for the kids if I had seized the opportunity. Curly and I are always careful to practice LNT, and what I learned was that not everybody does.

Pop tarts and instant coffee have a way of doing that to me!On the trail by 8am, we cruised along pretty much the same as the previous day. I was so proud of Curly as she led the way through most of these miles. We stopped once to eat a snack, and once to put on rain gear when the skies opened up on us. Other than that, we averaged 2 miles per hour, which for us is really good time considering we haven't hiked in two months.

The original plan was to stay there for the night, but I thought we wouldn't be arriving until much later in the day...this early hour got me to rethinking our strategy. We were wet from the rain and the crazy humidity, dirty and smelly after two days on the trail. I asked Curly if she would like to sleep in an air conditioned room tonight or the tent...like a true hiker she jumped at the hotel room! So we hung out for a couple hours visiting with our friends who had arrived shortly after us, then got our tails in gear and headed to town.With 3.2 miles to go and all downhill, we hustled into Hot Springs, arriving at 5pm. Checked out our lodging options and ended up at the Iron Horse Inn, which was right above the restaurant. Great place, reasonable prices, and hot showers. We cleaned up and decided on eating at Spring Creek Tavern. We were not disappointed at all. Delicious burgers and hiker portions of fries. That and a cold one...we were glad this decision was made. Plus it gave us a full day to play in Hot Springs tomorrow.","Walnut Mountain Shelter

Since our hike was complete for this trip, we had a few extra hours to play in this wonderful town. So, we got up and walked down to our third eating establishment, Smoky Mountain Diner. We arrived to the smiling faces of our new trail friends Brandon and Nikisha (sorry girl if I mangled the spelling of your name). We proceeded to have a full breakfast and great conversation reliving the moments on the trail. For those who are reading this and have not yet experienced the bonds of friendship that come so quickly on the trail, I can only hope you get that opportunity. It really is something special and the trail just has a way of creating connections. Not in the BFF way of lifelong buds, but ""in the moment"" ways. Very special.After breakfast and saying our good byes, we swung by Hot Spring Spas to see about a soak in the mineral springs before hitting the road. They had an immediate availability and we jumped into the soothing waters that this area is so well known for. Nothing like a soak for sore muscles. We enjoyed the view of the French Broad River from our tub, lazily watching the kayakers paddle down the river, and reluctantly got out of the tub when our time was up.As we drove towards home, with Hot Springs in our rear view mirror, both Curly Turtle and I agreed that this was one of the best section hikes yet, and we can't wait for 2018 when we will be passing through his quaint, extremely hiker friendly town again!

Being the incorrigible pragmatist, I reminded her that I work Sundays, and I didn't think we had enough time to plan a trip (I'm a pastor so Sundays aren't a day off). She said again, ""let's go"", and that was that.We had been told that Carvers Gap was a great place to hike, and since it was only 3 plus hours from the house, we decided to give it a go after I got off, around 1pm on Sunday. My plan was to hike north from Carvers Gap to Stan Murray Shelter that afternoon, hike south to Clyde Smith Shelter on Monday, then back to Carvers Gap on Tuesday. Perfect. Foolproof.   Plan. Curly's spontaneity and my ambition...we were on a roll.We had to return home for Curlys shoes, google maps doesn't work so hot when you don't have. Cell reception (no, I didn't download the directions), and by golly I never counted on the entire state of Rhode Island to be using the trails on Labor Day weekend! Unforseen Circumstances. We finally stepped off at 5pm and I figured 2 hours to the shelter...between the absolutely amazing views from every degree, and Curly working on her ever improving photography skills, the timing wasn't too far off. The views were truly the most spectacular I've seen on the trail. We hit Stan Murray shelter just after 7, but it was jammed full of 9 college grads working on Grassy Ridge, removing some weeds that were encroaching on the natural habitat. With no room at the inn, we headed toward Overmountain Shelter, just shy of 2 miles away. We thought certainly we would find a usable campsite and water on the way....uhhuh. Not happening.An hour later with darkness quickly descending and hunger setting in, Curly and I came to the entrance of Yellow Mountain Gap. I should have put a light on the sign. That tells you that you are at the entrance to Overmountain Shelter (did I say anything in that equation about attention to detail?). We found a place to settle in just off the trail and pitched our tent. Rather than cooking a hot meal we ate a snack and crashed.

Woody, I get why this shelter is one of your faves...it rose right to the top of ours. Curly and I definitely will be stopping by on our 2018 thru hike.So back we went in the direction of Carver's Gap, where we started the day before. With my original mileage plan blown out of the water, we just moved along, enjoying the day and not stressing over the miles. I'm not used to that kind of freedom, so this was a bit unusual, at least for me. We got back to the gap in early afternoon, and Curly wanted to stay the night on one of the balds for the sunset and sunrise. I figured we should hike to Roan High Knob Shelter, after all it is the highest shelter on the AT...gotta be great views there...right?Just shy of 2 miles later we reached the shelter, but the only views were ones not of panoramic skylines, but of black flies. Thousands of large, noisy, gross black flies. Not being sure of what attracted them to the shelter, and really not wanting to know, we turned around and headed back down Roan Mtn. Then back up to Round Bald for the third time in 2 days.There we pitched our tent, ate a hot meal, and snuggled into our sleeping bags as we awaited what would be a glorious sunset.

Many of these hikers brought along their furry companions on the trail, and let me say, the dogs were for the most part very well mannered. I'm a dog lover, but I don't go out of my way to touch or pet other people's animals. So on this trail over this weekend, there were a fair number of dogs. But my rant is not about the dogs...the dogs are cool. The dogs are awesome.What isn't cool, and what I don't understand, is how in the world can owners NOT CLEAN UP after their dogs? Specifically, when a pooch pinches one directly on the trail, how is it possible that the owner can just keep on going without picking that thing up...or at least flicking it off the trail? Honest to goodness, if I saw one turd I saw a dozen one one tiny piece of trail, and most of them had shoe tracks in them.C'mon people, use some common sense and leave no trace...even your pets trace, please?

We have just returned from a week long missions trip to Harmons, Jamaica. No, Harmons is not on the coast...you can't get to it by cruise ship or by airplane. It is located 3 plus hours into the interior of the country from Montego Bay. Harmons is a small town without running water, paved roads, zero traffic lights and most homes don't even have bathrooms in the main living area. Unemployment is around 90%, and there is a three year waiting list for one of the homes that our group built while we were there.The blessings in the week were found in the wonderful friendships made. Sharing the love of Christ with beautiful people welcoming us into their homes and hearts. Our group was able to not only build 2 houses, but we also had book fairs, soccer camps, block parties, and much more. Hard work, great friendships, and at the end of the week, Curly got her hike in up the mountain!

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551055,"It has been a challenge to find extended times to get out of town and into the woods. Curly Turtle and I have opted to take whatever moments we have, and as a result, we have done more over nighters than multiple day/night trips in 2016. Upside to that is you can be more spontaneous...down side is that your pack needs to be ready to go any time, any where. It's more of a challenge for me, because I thrive in a planned, structured setting. That's not how Curly rolls...so, you get the idea!We both had Thursday/Friday off, so we decided to head to Table Rock State Park. Just as an aside, there are great trails in South Carolina, particularly in the north west section of the state. Table Rock is one example. It is the eastern terminus of the Foothills Trail, and has multiple other trails within the parks boundaries. Great for day hikes, or like us, we simply hike out of the park boundary and on to the Foothills Trail, where camping is allowed.Our plan this time was to hike the Pinnacle Mtn Trail which follows the Foothills Trail, and hike up to the top, something we hadn't done yet. Then back down, hike off state park property and set up camp for the night. As usual, we got off to our usual late start and did our hiker sign in at the park visitor center around noon. Skies were overcast and temps in the low 70s, not bad weather, a bit warm, but not oppressive. Water sources were pretty much dried up which we anticipated, so we took 5 liters of water between us for this 1 night trip.We lollygagged for most of the afternoon, taking breaks and chatting with the handful of day hikers that were out. Views were minimal because of the cloud cover and lack of sun, but the elevation change was quick and for legs that hadn't been out in almost 2 months, it was a great workout! We finally reached the intersection of the Foothills and last leg of Pinnacle Mtn, and up we went. I don't think too many people visit the summit of Pinnacle Mtn...the trail is not used, lots of overgrowth, and few markings. It's a steep ascent and we were told by a couple we had met that the view was underwhelming. We finally reached the top and the view was indeed underwhelming, but hikers also understand that a goal achieved is still a satisfying moment...so satisfied, we were.Curly Turtle and I came down the mountain and back on to the trail. Hiking west we quickly came upon a camp site that was off state park property, and being that it was late in the day, we set up camp for the night. The night was a mild mid 50's, perfect sleeping weather with a light breeze passing thru. A screech owl nearby serenaded us after dark, along with the other night time sounds of the forest.

We scored a place outside of Luray with amazing views, a cozy fireplace, and only a three quarter mile road walk to the trail, about at the halfway point in Shenandoah National Park.It only stands to reason then that on the day before Thanksgiving, we would take a little hike northbound on the trail with our awesome kids and a gorgeous fall day. With a crisp 45 degrees and a slight wind to motivate us, we struck out on our little adventure. As always, we began going ""up"", but elevation was slight, and with only a day pack, it was a walk that warmed us up in body and spirit. With the trees bare and the leaves crunching beneath our feet, we followed a service road to the magical intersection where the trail crossed. It never ceases to amaze me as to how special it satisfies my heart to see those white blazes after an extended period of time. We headed north with the sun on our left shoulders and the trail calling us to move on.We did not have a map or guide with, just followed the blazes and after an hour or so, came to Blackrock summit just outside of Big Meadows. The views were stunning, as farms and homes dotted the countryside below, and the sun rays pierced the now bare trees with its warmth and light. We moved on and quickly came upon Big Meadows Lodge, now closed for the winter. I've read in other journals how docile the deer are in this area, and it is certainly true. As we cut through the area to check out Big Meadows, we were greeted by a doe who, rather than bolt upon seeing us, hung with us and allowed Curly to take a few pictures. We ascended to the Lodge area and were greeted by Russell, a maintenance employee and historian of this section of the park. In the short time we spent with Russell, he shared wonderful stories of his life growing up in this area and the incredible lifestyle of the people of the Shenandoah Park!With a view to get home, we said our goodbyes, and headed back the way we came, grateful for the opportunity once again to hike a small portion of this amazing trail, and whetting our appetite for our 2018 adventure.

In another post sometime down the road, I may share my hiking reading list, it has certainly become pretty extensive. But you are wondering, ""what does reading pleasure have to do with why you hike?"" Fair question, I have read ""Appalachian Trials"" by Zachary Davis multiple times. He encourages hikers to make different types of lists, one of which is why they want to hike the AT. Many journals on TJ share their varied reasons. I like that...it gives us readers some insights into people's souls, make the connection a little more familiar. Rather than me writing out 10 reasons why I want to hike the AT, I'll just share one reason why I hike period. It might get a bit long and a bit preachy, so if you hang in there, you have been forewarned!I was raised in the outdoors of Michigan. Family vacations were camping in the state parks, first in a tent, then a pull behind, and eventually my parents bought a cabin in the woods of northern MI. I hunted, fished and played in the woods year round. Then 20 years on active duty, with pretty much all of that being outdoors. My wife Curly Turtle and I would day hike occasionally and as our family grew up, we camped a little also, but our kids didn't enjoy the experience as much as we did, so we did other things. Once they grew up and moved on, we re-engaged with our love for the outdoors and the joy of being outside in the midst of Gods great creation has flourished, particularly over the last 4 years or so. Which brings me to why I hike, and especially why I love long distance backpacking.Hiking draws me close to God. It is more than simply a ""spiritual experience"", it is an intimate one. The beauty of the woods causes me to marvel at Gods creative majesty. Hiking in the Whites with horrible weather raging humbles me as I sense His power. Laying in our tent and being woken up in the middle of the night by owls talking to one another gives me pause and reminds me that even in the solitude, I'm not alone. Hiking is just not spiritual for me, it is highly relational and energizing. It is awe inspiring. The first sentence in the Bible says, ""In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth"" Genesis 1:1...for me, a walk in the woods leads me to conclude this declaration is very much true.There are other reasons why I hike, but drawing close in a personal relationship with the Creator of the Universe eclipses all the others. And I simply cannot wait to experience that on what hopefully will be a deeper level when we take our own walk in the woods in 2018!","Home

Let me tell you, this trail follows the Green River, first you are hiking alongside the river, only to face an upward climb and suddenly the river is way below. The views were spectacular on this 3.5 mile one way, 7 miles total hike. It was such a beautiful day and we had all of it to enjoy...so much so that for once, I felt no need to race down the trail.Plenty of folks had the same idea, so the trail was busy, but not in a bad way. The sun found its way through the bare trees, and with many of the trees being faked out by what they think is an early spring, buds are beginning to appear. The forest floor was blanketed in young ferns popping their heads out from the leafy blanket above them, and with new pine trees just appearing, it was obvious that winter was on the decline and spring on the ascendancy!We hit the end of the trail at a beautiful outcropping of rocks, and ate our lunch. We were entertained by the many whitewater kayakers passing down stream...these guys were amazing! Paddling over waterfalls and maneuvering around huge boulders, it was like having a front row seat to the X games...it was an outrageous day.After lunch, the four of us turned around and made our way back to the vehicle, looking forward to our visit into the little mountain town of Saluda. I am sorry that we hadn't visited sooner, such a quaint, laid back place.

Then topped it off with ice cream. No, we aren't thru hikers yet, but we certainly are like it!

Wonderfully, as we climbed up and out of the gap, the skies parted their clouds, the sun came out, and the temps started to rise. Hmm, I thought, maybe we dodge a bullet this time out. For the next three plus hours we dawdled as the views were so beautiful, and between overlooks, chatting with other hikers and the occasional snack, we reached our campsite at 4pm. With the weatherman predicting rain at 5, we got set up and heated some water for hot tea...and almost right on cue, at 430pm, the drops began to fall. Eventually we got into our tent and for the first time ever, we ate a cold dinner. Played a little dice and around 7 called it a nite. The rain was coming down hard by then and continued with varying levels of intensity all night and into the next morning. All night long, the thunder, the lightning, and the wind were all reminders that man really isn't in charge when he is out in nature (or anywhere else for that matter). Definitely keeps one humble!   We have had really good success with our REI tents, and this one, the Quarterdome 3, passed the rain test with flying colors! Heavy as all get out when wet, but sharing it with Curly helped a lot. All in all, a pretty good night!","

Between a light rain and mist, we slogged our way back south towards town. The views were obscured by fog and rain, but there is such a fresh newness in the trail at the tail end of a good cleansing rain. Fortunately, the temps were in the 40's, so it was almost perfect hiking weather. We only had 5 miles to hike anyways, and with a 3pm appointment at the Spa for the ""deluxe"" hot tub...we were digging the moment.Going into town is a magical experience...it seems that you always make better time even in cruddy weather. The prospect of town food, even for section hikers is just so compelling. Two hours after stepping off we were in town, packs locked in the truck, and headed towards Smokey Mountain Diner. I love that place! Fresh, home made, gooey, hot Cinnamon Buns....do I need to continue? I'm drooling as I write this.

Hiking was challenging, but the sights made step worth it. When we hit the 9 mile point we stopped for a longer than normal break. Fueling up and resting up for what lie before us, the infamous Heart Break Ridge! A total of .7 of a mile that includes step...lots of steps. To ease the pain, we counted those steps going up and down. Bottom line is that 291 + 271 equals great pain. That was the total steps we counted in both directions.

The good news is that the picnic tables were the pot of gold at the end of the day!Up and over the Ridge we went, huffing and puffing all the way; and wow what a great gift that met us...beautiful campsites on the Toxaway River.

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561587,"No matter how many miles you hike, no matter how many days you are on the trail...the one constant is that there are lessons to be learned. From this past weekend, here are a few tips I picked up from the trail...1. Pace yourself - big miles and small breaks are a recipe for disaster. The body and mind needs to enjoy the journey, after all it ain't a marathon, right?2. Keep cutting...weight that is - it only increases your hiking pleasure when the weight on your back is bearable. Obviously that is in proportion to comfort, but for me, less is more (with qualifications).3. Great partners make for a great hikes - I love hiking with my wife Curly Turtle, and adding Barb made for an awesome weekend. They both hike at similar paces, and it allows me to enjoy my time without as much worry. Plus, it's always great having another person in camp...great conversations and great times.4. Breaking camp - will either make or break the day! Getting out of camp at a decent morning hour makes a huge difference in the rest of the day. Late starts make for longer, more painful days. I prefer early starts and more time on the trail to take my time.5. Food is still the wild card - with Curly Turtle being gluten free, and the fact that we share cook utensils and food, we still need to work that out. To be honest, most gluten free food is horrible (IMHO), so we need to learn some more lessons along the way for that one!All in all, a wonderful hike, and we can't wait for the next adventure, which is hiking all of Shenandoah National Park at the end of May...stay tuned!","Home

We have been tweaking our gear, and I finally pulled the trigger and bought an EE Revelation 20 degree quilt. So excited, this drops almost 2 pounds from my base weight!

Originally our plan was to do 13 and stop at Pass Mtn Hut but we decided to do 17+ and stop at Birds Nest #3, so off we went.  The day was cloudy and overcast but rain held off.  Temps were probably low 60's so it was great hiking weather and the miles flew by.  That is until we hit our last mountain of the day Mt Mary.  She kicked our butts!  2.5 miles of ascending elevation, and the trail reminded me of the Whites, only the rocks were considerably smaller.  The three of us went into ""plod"" mode and simply put one foot in front of the other.  It was brutal and the weather got wetter and wetter.

Last nite we had just hunkered down in our tents for the nite. I was definitely jittery because of my fear of being too close to the trail for stealth camping, but we were out of options, so into the tent we went...I'll let Curly Turtle tell you: 
So, last night we saw our first bear.  Real close.  Too close really.  I am kicking myself for not snapping a picture but at the time we were focused on getting it to move on.  We heard a branch snap and un-zipped our fly to see this medium size bear sauntering by about 10 feet away!  Thankfully all our smelly's and food was hung long before and we ate at the picnic area so there was nothing attractive about us.  Forceflex kept yelling something like, ""get away bear"" and I threw a stick at him.

By lunch time we were at Blackrock Hut and with Curlys knees squawking at her, it was time for a little break.  This was also the last water available southbound for over 11 miles. Following a break and some vitamin I, we were back at it, not sure how long and far we'd hike given the forecast for bad weather.

Hard to believe this trip was just about in the books...only 7 miles to the vehicle we had left just a week ago.  In spite of the difficult miles we hiked yesterday, those made  us that much closer to being done.
We broke camp and took off at a very leisurely pace around 8am.  Rain wasn't projected to start until noon or so and I figured we'd be long back by then.  Little did I  know that the girls would be in ""picture taking"" mode, which isn't leisurely...it's touristly!
The views were so much different than the entire previous week, we found ourselves walking through meadows and open areas.  It really wasn't till we were in the last two miles that the Shennies reminded us that they were indeed mountains.  The last one, Bear Den Mtn had probably the severest ""up"" of the week...it was straight up and no switchbacks!  I was huffing and puffing to get up that beast, and then just like that it was crested.
Then just like we started, we had to finish...with rain!  The buckets came down our last mile, and this time I didn't bother putting on the rain gear. To heck with it...I started wet and I'd finish wet!  Just like that, we came off the mountain and there was the vehicle we had left just a week earlier...it was surreal because it happened so fast.
We dried ourselves off as best we could, donned our hiker town clothes and made a beeline for the hiker world famous Mings Garden AYCE buffet in Waynesboro.  They gladly seated us all by ourselves in the hikers section of the establishment and we ate ourselves into a good coma.  A fitting end to a fitting journey.

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566728,"Now that a couple of days have passed since we completed this section hike, I've had some time to reflect on the experience and think through some of the lessons learned.  More importantly, As a result of this hike, I'm completely rethinking whether Curly and I will attempt a 2018 thru hike of the AT.  I will share some thoughts on that in a future post, because I'm still working through my thoughts...for now, here are a few post-hike lessons learned:
1.  ""The Trail"" Runs The Show!  I am a control freak and love to plan; when things don't go my way or I feel out of control, I tend to stress out.  The trail is in charge, not me.  Hikers are bound by the circumstances they find themselves in, whether that is weather related, circumstantial, or physical. I gotta accept and roll with whatever the trail gives...good, bad or otherwise.  Flexibility is so important...bend but don't break!
2.  Don't Overdue It (pace yourself).  I've written this before but it bears repeating, because my body is my only means of transportation and if I wreck it, that has a negative impact on the experience.  We planned for hiking 8 days and on day 2 decided to make it in 7.  That meant upping our mileage significantly for the remainder of the week.  We did two 20 mile plus days and at the end, Curlys knees were in great pain. I was hurting at night, having a difficult time sleeping.  Fortunately nothing serious, but I must be patient and listen to my body.
3.  Don't be Proud (take advantage of resources available).  Use the hostels and waysides and stores available to supplement food and comfort.  Why bring more food in the pack when I can travel lighter, eat better, and sleep more comfortably utilizing the available resources?  It's going to cost more to do this and that's the trade off.  For us, one evening in the middle of our hike, after 3 days of rain, to sleep dry in a lodge made all the difference in our fun factor.
4.  Staying Warm is More Important than not Being Wet.  I give credit to this one from Slip N Slide, a 2016 SOBO we met and hiked with early in our trip.  You are going to be wet every single day you are hiking.  Period.  So hike warm rather than worrying about dry and your comfort level goes exponentially up.  It might mean carrying more warm clothes but that is going to be extra weight well carried.

We decided to finish this hike by noon on Monday, so we upped our miles yesterday and today to get within 7 or so miles on Monday.  We woke up to a gorgeous day and decided to make the most of it.  With Curly leading the way, we put on some good miles early on, and the views did not disappoint!  We have hiked this trip through forests, meadows, cow pastures, and got the first time, road walking! 
We also got our first ever trail magic!  We crossed a stream at route 12, and on the other side was a container full of sodas.  Curly and I split a root beer and it tasted pretty darn good.  Many thanks to the kind trail angel.
Another highlight of this trip has been meeting all the thru hikers.  NOBOs and SOBOs are flying through this area, all focused in the end game.  For those headed to Katahdin, you can see and hear that this trip has been an epic adventure for them...for those traveling south, they've been through the really tough stuff and are dialing in just ramping up the miles.  It's a blessing to meet and talk with these folks; they inspire Curly and I to do the same some day.
We have about 7.5 miles to Hanover tomorrow and we go back to being tourists.  This section really has been one of a kind!","Dana Hill

Today we wrapped up our hike and are hogging a bench in the green at Dartmouth, waiting on a bus to take us back to Killington.  We began the day up at 5 am and hiking by 6am. We wanted to get to Happy Hill Shelter last night but us old folks ran out of steam.  We stealth camped at a beautiful site along a noisy stream that serenaded us to sleep.  Of course we woke up to the prospect of one final climb of the trip.  Morning is definitely our best time to hike...we fade hard in the afternoons.
Amazingly, we hiked those miles in 4 hours, unheard of but I guess the knowledge of being finished plus town food is like a tractor beam that pulls you in.  On our way into town we met a SOBO named Scout.  He is hiking the AT to finish up the Triple Crown! Such a delightful guy and very gracious.  He and his wife Frodo live in San Diego and host literally hundreds of PCT hikers as they begin their journey north.  What a blessing to meet someone like that!  And speaking of trail angels, I think we passed at least 3 coolers of drinks and goodies for hikers.  We split a water and a snickers. It feels weird as a section hiker to enjoy trail magic that thru hikers have ""earned"", someday we hope to these these totally gracious and unconditional acts of kindness on our own thru hike.

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571997,"Curly and I have been thinking through what we learned about this hike.  For what it's worth, here you go:

1.  What's your plan B?  I forgot to bring a lighter with me, and as I use a Sno Peak stove with piezo lighter, should be no big deal right?  Wrong!  My piezo lighter came off the stove on day 2 and I couldn't reattach.  Without a lighter, I had to jury rig the piezo, which fortunately worked, but if it hadn't...we would have been discovering the joys of stoveless meals.  A little more attention to detail on my part would have been smart.  Some things probably need a backup.

2.  The name of the game is Perseverance, not Pace.  There were a ton of thru hikers on the trail, heading in both directions.  The young ones heading north like us would fly by each day...and inevitably at the end of the day, we would find that we had caught up to them!  We are early risers and day long hikers, which makes up for lack of speed.  We learned that all we need to do is be steady and persistent...the miles will work themselves out.

3.  Stop and smell the Wildflowers.  I mentioned in an earlier post that the beauty of this trip was remarkable...and it bears repeating again.  Why?  Because we took time to enjoy it; to make memories in it, and that takes time as well.  But some thing are worth taking your time over.  Hiking should not be a foot race, and this trip for us was one of a kind!",,View Entry,"Jul 14, Fri",0
Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572545,"Curly and I have decided that we will not be hiking the AT in 2018. Our two hikes this summer, Shenandoah National Park and Killington to Hanover, have led us to two conclusions that have led to this decision. 
First, we need to be able to hike our own hike, and for us, that will mean that we hike on our terms, at our pace, and on our timeline. A 7 month sabbatical is incredibly generous, and I'm exceptionally grateful to my leadership for generously giving me the time. But I will always have the end date hanging over my head, and it will be best for us both if I am retired when we go on this adventure. Lord willing, we will both be healthy enough when the time is right. We are still young...fingers are crossed.
Second, and related to the first reason, we have Curlys mom living with us, and has for the past 3 years. Her health has declined significantly in the past year, so much so that leaving her alone is out of the question. We had hoped that part time caregiving would be a viable option when we first made the decision to go in 2018. It just isn't feasible right now.
We are disappointed for sure, but also hopeful that the opportunity will still be there in a couple of years. The good news is that the AT isn't going anywhere, and there are plenty of trails to be hiking. If we can swing it, we hope to hike the Long Trail in 2018. It's a small compromise, but it's still hiking.
We are going to move our journal over to the Long Trail 2018 section. Check us out if you care to, and many thanks to all the folks we have had the privilege of meeting and a sharing the common love for the AT.",,View Entry,"Jul 19, Wed",0

Curly and I are going to try and make a thru hike in 2019. We planned on 2018, I had approval from work for a sabbatical, and after we hiked SNP this past May, we realized that we needed more flexibility than a hike in 2018 would allow. So...we are pushing the hike out one year and think we can get all of our ducks in a row. 
Stay tuned as we share our misadventures for all to see! We are cautiously optimistic and look forward to seeing things unfold.","

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580785,"With family members in the house over Thanksgiving, we missed the ""opt outside"" mania yesterday, so decided to make up for it today. We headed to the Palmetto Trail Lynch's Woods passage in Newberry, about 20 mins from home. It was actually our first visit there which was a suprise given how close it was to the house.
This was a last minute decision, and we went without paper maps, which I hate to do. Fortunately, we had cell service and used what was online. And a good thing we did. The trail is only three miles long, but it does not loop back to the parking area, so we had to jump on a couple of equestrian trails (watch your step!), as well as some road walking. Turned out that we ended doing a leisurely 5 miles, and with cool weather, it made for a great morning. One thing for sure, there was very little signage, absolutely no blazes, and with the leaves off trees, the trail was a challenge to follow. Which actually was great as it forced Curly and I to pay heed to what we were doing. Very much different from the easy hiking of the AT!!
All in all, a great day hiking new territory. I think I'll give the Palmetto Trail Conservatory folks a call and see about doing some trail maintenance in that section.","

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581052,"I am embarassed to share that once again, Curly and I are back ""on"" for a 2018 thru hike! For those who have kept up with us, we shared back in March that I was given a sabbatical at work for a 2018 thru hike. Then we tackled Shenandoah National Park in late May, and after that, I was very concerned that our timing was not right, for a number of reasons. Hiking a large chunk of the AT in Vermont in July confirmed, at least in my mind, that we should postpone. So that's what we did. Fast forward several months later and both of us get the feeling that maybe we are making a big mistake. After all, we ain't getting any younger, and the truth is that there will never be a perfect time to do this. There will always be a reason not to. Then I receive a great email from El Vago, who thru hiked this year, and a wonderful guy we met in SNP. He read we weren't going forward and his note challenged us to reconsider our decision. That impacted me greatly, and so I went back to my boss and told him if it was ok, I would like to resume planning for 2018, just pushing my departure back to mid April. He was extremely gracious and said yes...so here we are, with 4 months to go!
As we restart all of our plans that were either abandoned or put on hold, I must say that I'm kind of glad that we are this close to the starting line with just a little time to prepare. It will certainly keep us both busy, and I don't doubt April will arrive in no time. We look forward to experiencing this once in a lifetime adventure, and sharing it with you.","

Last week we saw the Trans Siberian Orchestra (check that off my bucket list), and this week we headed up to Hendersonville for a weekend getaway. Amongst all the great food and very cool AirBnB we stayed at, we also spent all of Friday morning hiking the Carl Sandburg estate in Flat Rock. If you are ever in the area and have your trail runners on, I highly recommend it.
The homestead is actually part of the national park system, and there are several miles of hiking trails on the 245 acre estate. Remarkable views, at least in winter, and two mountains to hike...little Glassy mountain and Glassy Mountain. Just being out was incredible, but the area had been blanketed with snow a week earlier, so the place was a wonderland. We decided not to take day packs or sticks, Just head out. Crisp and cool, we put one foot in front of the other and enjoyed the day. Reaching the top of Glassy Mountain, we turned around and taking a different trail, eventually wound down the mountain and found ourselves at the Sandburg homestead. Ended up hiking 4.5 miles...not too bad for a morning out. We meandered our way back to the truck and ate our lunch inside the cab with the heat blasting. For those of us who live in the South, a 32 degree day is a bit nippy :-)

As word has gotten out, the conversations have been quite interesting. Pretty much everyone has shown a lot of support and excitement...and the fact that we will be sharing this trip on multiple social media platforms provides a way for those who are interested to be included in this journey with us. The more the merrier! Curly and I don't take for granted the fact that this trip really is a gift, because I'm not retiring, this is a leave of absence. The church I serve in and its leadership are incredibly supportive, as are all of the incredible staff members who will be sharing my duties while gone.
What has been really interesting to me has been simply checking off the extensive ""to do"" list. For every three items checked, we add another item! If we weren't hiking as a couple, the list would be greatly diminished, but with no one to tend to the home fires, well, we have to contract that as well. It's been fun, and certainly an exercise in logistics planning, but we are getting there. Medical and Dental checkups...house sitter...dog sitter...mother in law sitter...lawn care...trash pickup...bills on auto pay...list of support system personnel and contractors in place on speed dial...goodness what a monster! And as each task is checked off, a little bit more excitement for what lays ahead.
All that being said, my last day at work is April 8th, and our hope is that grandson Ayden is born by then...off to Springer to step off some time between 9-13 April. We are hoping for a few forecasted days of decent weather to begin this hike, that might impact our decision as well.","

This weekend was a reminder that we have our work seriously cut out for us but there are amazing people along the way to support and encourage.
We attended 4 different presentations, all of which were excellent. We learned a lot and added to our hiking tool kit. Spending the night in tent city was a great confirmation that our decision to leave in April was a good one. It's still just a tad bit cold for us, and I would rather be chasing spring than hiking with winter.
Best of all though, was meeting amazing people face to face that I have been reading about for years. The author of one of my favorite AT books, Gary Sizer and his wife Katie were there...such a delightful team. As a side note, I highly recommend ""Where's The Next Shelter?"" for a fun and very enjoyable read. 
But best of all, by far, was meeting and spending a little time with Jimmy and Sherry (""I Believe""). These two are an amazing couple that spend a lot of time up and down the trail serving and ministering to hikers. They are kind, gracious and extremely encouraging.

You can draw your own conclusions.
We camped at the base of Sassafras mountain and in spite of its reputation, pop tarts and coffee conquered it. Again like the day before, the trail was very generous to us and we made good time. Had lunch at Gooch Mt shelter at 1130am, and headed out for our planned destination, Woody Gap, which would be a ten mile day.  Arrived there about 230 and got some water from the good folks at Zion Baptist Church and took a shoes off break.  Decided to shoot for Lance Creek campsite, just shy of four more miles.
On our way, we climbed up to Preacher Rock and the wide open vistas were incredible. A local who was up there pointed out South Carolina to us.  We were told to expect big crowds at the camping area so when we came upon a large stealth site about 4 tenths of a mile away, we decided to call it a day.

Our morning began with Wildcat Mountain, which I dubbed “she devil”, because it was much more than a wild cat, this mountain was from a darker place. I’m not sure why it was so difficult,  particularly since it was our first climb of the day which is typically our best climb (everything gets harder from there). It had switchbacks which are always appreciated. I think it caught us by surprise because it just never seemed to end!  Thankfully the weather cooperated and we pressed onward and came up over the other side. 
Oddly, the trail gave way to fairly easy grades for most of the day afterwards, and we played leapfrog with some folks who started their thru hike the same time as us.  Good things always come to an end, and in our quest to wrap up the day with going up and over Blue Mountain, we found ourselves not on a trail but what seemed like a rock quarry!  For at least the last half mile, we navigated up over and around rocks, once again showing us that this trail has much more to teach us than we can imagine.
We drug ourselves into camp and set up our tent, then cooked dinner at the shelter, socializing with the hikers congregated.  (Shout out to Drew Noller - the red beans and rice meal was OUTSTANDING! Many thanks.)

We decided since the temps would be in the mid 50’s, we would wear shorts and save our long pants for the next day which was projected to be in the low 40’s and snow. Even with rain gear on there was no staying dry today, truly some of the wettest weather we’ve experienced.

Now we are not fans of staying in shelters, they are not private and they have mice and other critters, but our tent was soaked, we couldn’t sleep in it, and snow was projected overnight with below freezing temps...so the dry Shelter it was.  Understand that shelters are 3 sided buildings with a platform for sleeping on, some pegs to hang your packs, usually bear cables to hang your food out of Yogi’s reach, maybe a picnic table...oh, and did I mention mice? Shelters are completely open on one side and exposed to the elements. And they are made for a certain number of people. The one we occupied held 7, and we squeezed in 11! Just like sardines!

Within the hour (or more) we were off on an 11.3 mile stroll to Dicks Creek Gap and what we thought would be a bunk at Top of Georgia Hostel.
OK, now for the worst.  Poor Curly from the very first step just bonked.  She had no energy, stamina, even the motivation of town couldn’t get her to move. Feet were heavy like bricks and with the prospect of close to a thousand foot climb looming at Addis Mountain, we were struggling. The weather was nasty with temps at freezing and a vicious bitter wind blowing sideways.  Our goal (my goal) was to get to our destination by 1pm to allow us time for town chores.  We actually made good time at first, hiking 5.5 miles in the first three hours...then it all came crashing down and our hike slowed down to a literal crawl. We had a mountain to climb and it was a toughie! Simply one foot in front of the other was all we could do. Curly was feeling bad because she was feeling bad. I was feeling the stress of not making it to town and having to spend another night in a nasty, wet tent with a freeze warning in place.  We just plodded, which is what us old folks do...both our phones were dead so no way to call the hostel, and then we found out with a couple miles to go that the hostel was booked solid!  Oh gosh, huge disappointment which slowed us down even more...
And now, the rest of the story.  We made it to Top of Georgia at 2pm, finishing our hike in 7 hours. We won’t win any races at that pace, but we are not in a race.  Knowing they had no room and we had no phone, a young couple who are cousins, Squeek and Squatch, couldn’t get a room cause they were too young and didn’t have a credit card.  Well, we are old and do, so they called Holiday Inn Express and we got the room! 4 nasty hikers in one room and, the cost ended up being the same as if we stayed at the hostel...and we didn’t sleep in bunk beds!
Showers were taken, wet gear laid out for drying, resupply accomplished, AYCE (all you can eat) at Daniels and laundry done! Best. Ending. Ever to the worst day yet.
Tomorrow back to the trail for a three and a half day hike into NC and a push towards Franklin bringing us a bit closer to the Smokies.","Tray Mountain Shelter

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587101,"It’s amazing how good life is when you are clean, your clothes are clean, and you slept in a comfy (clean) bed...all three of which we experienced last night. Waking up to fresh coffee and heat coming from an air duct was exquisite!  We got ourselves around and took a 10 am shuttle back to where we were picked up yesterday. Our immediate and pressing goal was to get to North Carolina at Bly Gap about 9 miles or so. We had to hustle cause we didn’t start hiking till almost 11am.  The day was beautiful with bright sunshine, few clouds, about 50 degrees which is all great hiking weather. 
Unfortunately, Curly’s lunch about 130pm didn’t sit well, and she got nauseous.  Which slowed her down and with some huge mountains in front of us, she struggled big time.  I felt terrible for her but could do nothing...except to hike on.  And we did.  With a lot of grit Curly pressed on and we entered N.C. at 430pm today...one exact week since we began the journey. I was quite surprised then when Curly said she wanted to hike to the next shelter...but if she is game, I certainly am.  We continued on and to be honest, I began to doubt the wisdom of this move, but hey, we were all in. Over the next 2.5 hours we hiked about 1,400 feet of elevation and 2.9 more miles. We limped into Muskrat Creek Shelter after 7, set up tent next to this amazing bubbling brook and ate a quick dinner.  It’s 9pm and waaay I past my bedtime.  Tomorrow a 12.5 mile is planned, hoping that Curly is up to snuff.  I will share in a future post some lessons we have been learning over the past week...definitely humbling!","Dicks Creek Gap

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587237,"We woke up this morning feeling good and fully rested.  Curly slept very well and was ready for the day.  I can say that this day turned out to be one of our best, both in terms of weather and mileage.  The trail was incredibly gentle with gradual ascents and easy descents.  Even Standing Indian Mountain, which had over 1,000 feet in elevation change did so over three miles! We really enjoyed the day and ate a nice lunch at the top
Of the mountain.  The rest of the day was moving ourselves in position to tackle Albert Mountain early tomorrow and be ready for a short day into Franklin on Friday.
I wanted to share some lessons we learned in this first week.  No matter how long you do something you can always learn and get better.  This trail humbles you if you think you know it all, so in the spirit of NOT knowing it all, here are some things we learned this past week:
FAILS
Sharing phone charger - airplane mode won’t cut it and neither will one charger for two people.
Tooth powder - lighter but yuckier...we ended up paying $2 for a travel size toothpaste as a result.
Waterproof socks - no such thing, $46 wasted, enuf said.
Timely reservations at hostels - when every hiker in north Georgia is trying to escape bad weather, don’t wait till day before to make a reservation, you won’t get one.
SUCCESSES
Good mileage choices - we set goal of 10-12 miles per day and that has been right for us. No blisters, shin splints or any other aches beyond normal hiking all day aches.
Dry camping - we have avoided shelters most nights and that’s a great choice. Carrying in water to camp in solitude is worth the effort.
Tray Mtn Shelter 8 mile day - this one time we did use a Shelter was literally a life saver. To sleep in a soaking wet tent in sub 30 temps with snow would have been life threatening. There are exceptions for most everything.
Clothing choices - both of us are very happy with the clothes we brought. All pieces have been used, and we are warm when it’s cold and cool when it’s hot.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587240,"We did some big miles yesterday so that we could face Albert Mountain first thing this morning, and set us up for a 3.5 mile hike to Franklin on Friday.  Because today would be a short one, we took our time getting around and were on the trail by 820am.
It seems like with each day we face a new challenge, and today that would be our highest climb yet...Albert Mountain. It wasn’t just thousand foot ascent to the top, it was an amazing scramble up. No gentle grades for this day. It felt like we were hiking in the Whites again, and it took us a solid hour to navigate the rock scrambles. But...it was a beautiful and clear day, and when we summited, the views were breathtaking. We lingered up on top for at least an hour, it was hard to break away. Sadly the pictures we take on our phones or cameras truly do no justice to the glory of what our eyes see.  I wept most of the way up, not because of the pain but because of God’s glorious creation on display. I could only wonder if earth, as broken as it is can display such beauty, how much more will the new heaven and new earth display?  I hope I never forget the visual imagery I saw today.
Sadly, it was time to move on and that we did. With another 5 miles to get under our belts before the day ends, we pressed on to our destination Rock Gap Shelter.  Arriving at 130pm, we set up camp, ate a hot lunch and took a nap.  All in all a fantastic day on the trail and before the books!","Betty Creek Gap

No Spam, no Peanut Butter, just glorious well cooked burgers and whatever else we were desiring. Our pickup from the Gap was around 10-1030am so we broke camp and were on the trail by 730am. It’s remarkable how fast you can hike when deliciousness awaits you at the end of the trail.
We hit the Gap with time to spare, and after a couple of fits and starts we made it to Gooder Grove Hostel, this very cool, neat place. Zen, the owner is an awesome guy who works hard to accommodate hikers, and he does a great job of it. We enjoyed our stay there and recommend it highly to all passing thru.
After showers, we walked into town and I had a double cheeseburger with grilled onions and mushrooms while Curly had a watermelon salad with chicken.  We haven’t talked much about food up to now just because there are more important things to write about...but with town stories, how can I resist?  After lunch we resupplied for the next 4 days and stopped for a chai tea (CT) and coffee (FF) and scone. Back to the hostel to clean up the tent and gold laundry. Then out to WalMart for another resupply then back into town for Dinner. We had Korean pulled pork and some kind of Nachos for dinner.

We had a great 24 hours in Franklin, but it was time to hit the trail before we got too soft.  So catching a 930am shuttle to the trail, we were hiking just after 10am.  My “hope” was to do about 16 miles to Cold Stream Shelter...alas, my hopes were dashed on the rocks of Reality.
It was a beautiful day with lots of sun and no clouds...I thought we hit the jackpot.  We made it to Siler Bald by 1245pm and stopped for a lunch at the top. We had made almost 5 miles in that first stretch so I was feeling pretty good about our miles.  The afternoon phase was to hike to Wayah Fire Tower about 5-6 miles away.  It was like everything changed after lunch.  The terrain became more difficult; we were climbing higher elevations; and I don’t know if I can blame the lunch, but our feet were dragging all afternoon. It took us less than 3 hours to hike the first five miles, and almost 4 to hike same distance in the afternoon.  There was no way we had any juice left to hike 5 more miles.  By the time we reached the shelter, Curly and I were toast.
We set up camp, cooked a dinner of chicken and rice, hung our food and will probably be asleep before any of you read this post!  Tomorrow we will press on towards the Smokies. Rain is due in for the next 4 days (ugh), but you know what they say...”no RAIN, no pain, no Maine!!","Winding Stair Gap

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588021,"We woke up to...wait for it...wait for it...rain! Third day in a row, beginning to look like a trend. Nonetheless, we were not deterred and planned on a big miles day because Fontana Village was awaiting us the next day, and the more miles we hiked today would be less miles tomorrow.  We did spend our second night in a shelter, this one being a double decker, pretty high society.  
Early in the day it rained pretty much the whole morning, and just something we dislike but the truth about this is that on the AT, if you hike only when the sun is shining, you might not get more than a few miles up the trail.  We made pretty decent time in the morning in spite of the weather, playing leapfrog with “Two Hats”, a nice gentlemen from Boston.  About 1230pm, we dropped down into Stecoah Gap and one of the most beautiful sights to a hiker appeared...a trash can!  Seriously, you don’t know how much thru hikers appreciate a place to offload their trash. We don’t bury it, or burn it, and the good ones don’t pitch it-we pack it out.  So even after a couple days in the woods, you can imagine how much trash accumulates.  And Curly and I pick up others trash as well, so our bag gets pretty big pretty quick.  Anyways we headed north out of Stecoah Gap and immediately were introduced to “Jacobs Ladder”, this insidiously mean spirited attempt by the trail gods to break our hearts and make us cry for mommy!  This upward climb was absolutely straight up and it was like looking at a skyscraper.  There were feeble attempts to create steps in order to give the appearance of a normal climb, but noooo, nothing normal about this.  You would gasp up one portion only to turn a corner and see another ascent.  The grade was so severe that you were leaning forward almost parallel to the ground like those ski jumpers in the olympics parallel to their skis. I silently, then out loud cursed that hill and renamed it “spawn of Satan”.  Toughest climb yet.
We finally reached the top and moved on, but not without one more dirty look on my part.  Fortunately the rest of the afternoon was rather uneventful and the rain had actually ceased for the time being.  With the day fast ending we reached 6pm and one mile remaining to our destination when, of course, it started raining cats and dogs. One mile to ending the day dry! Oh so close, but not today.  We slogged into the shelter and fortunately got two spots in a dry space. Curly had Spam and Mashed Potatoes and I had Ramen and Spam for dinner. Seriously, I understand why Hawaii has named Spam the State national treasure!  So good.
We ended the day hiking 15.2 miles which leaves us 6.6 from Fontana Village and a big juicy burger.  Life is great on the trail!","Sassafras Gap Shelter

I love waking up and hiking.  I love the whole experience that it entails, even the weather (to a much lesser degree).  This is a remarkable adventure, almost a pioneer like thing, and I hope I never take it for granted.  Having said all that...there ain’t nothing like the “pull” of going into town!  The incentive of getting clean, getting your clothes clean, sleeping in a comfy bed...and the food.  Oh the food.  I think the hiker hunger has definitely hit Curly big time, all she talked about this morning was getting a big burger.  She didn’t want to do anything else til we ate.  First and foremost.
And so we packed up at camp and said “see ya up the trail” to our shelter mates and hit it hard.  With 6.5 miles to go and according to a former thru hiker we met the previous nite , only “one” big up along the way, we were figuring on an easy and quick morning. Yeah, right.
The big up began going out of camp and seemed to continue for a good chunk of the day.  I know intellectually that’s not the case, but emotionally, when you want to get somewhere real bad, the destination never arrives quick enough. Kind of like Christmas morning as a kid.  Of course this was also day 4 of rain, and with the torrential, all night downpour, the trail was slicker than snot on a door knob.  We couldn’t get a grip on the trail up or down.  Thank goodness for hiking poles. My new favorite accessory.  Those puppies saved us a lot of pain and misery.
About half way into the morning, Fontana Dam appeared thru the trees, and as we dropped into lower elevations, the green of the forest really is starting to pop.  We finally came out of the woods around noon at the Fontana Hilton, a shelter with a solar charging station, real bathroom and the last shelter before entering the Smokies.  Got a shuttle into Fontana Village and went straight to the grill.
All I can tell you is not to get your hands between Curly and her food.  She devoured a huge burger and fries and I had to talk her out of the wings, but promised them for dinner!  Yep hiker hunger is upon us.  We headed to the Fontana Lodge, which is a neat, old throwback to mountain retreats back in the 50s.  Lots of pics on the walls of hoe downs with women in puffy dresses and big hair. Men all slicked up in cowboy shirts and brill cream ( anyone ever hear of that?).  Got cleaned up, dried out everything in the pack, laundry completed, even squeezed in a short nap, and got our permits for the Smokies.  Oh yeah, ate a huge dinner and gonna say good night as we head off into the mountains in the morning.  Weather forecast?  You got it...rain!","Cable Gap Shelter

This amazing Mary Poppinish invention was attached to our shoulder straps and we were mostly dry for the rest of the day.  And that my friends is about the only highlight of our day.  Curly and I both struggled with the muddy trail, slipping and sliding and trying to keep our shoes on.  The trail seemed to go perpetually up and rarely down, and it was fairly cold. The result is that we didn’t take a single “pack off” break all day and basically hiked for 7 plus hours. Curly was not happy with me at all and I felt bad.  So I cooked her a gourmet meal...Mexican chicken and rice! It was devoured so fast it would make your head swim!

And it’s incredible how sunshine puts absolutely everybody in a good mood.  Hikers in both directions were smiling and couldn’t stop talking about the last several days.  Curly and I had a pretty easy morning, making some good time and just loving the springtime growth taking place in the forest.  Entire ridge lines are bathed in green with tiny white flowers covering space almost like snow.  The sunshine easily works it’s way thru the trees as they have not yet engulfed the forest in their foliage.
After a nice hot lunch on a grassy hillside, we made our way to climb the infamous Rocky Top (let’s hear it Vols)...and the fun suddenly ended. The ascents for the remainder of the day were steep and much of the trail still very muddy. The views however made up for the pain.  Incredible views that were 360 degrees and visibility for miles!  Definitely most beautiful day of the hike.
It took us a while to get into camp, longer than we would have preferred, but the shelter had room for us and we are now seeing the same people over an extended period of time. Some of the folks we are bunking with are Sparky, Bushwhacker,Fungi and Becca.  Fungi and Becca have a dog Black Jack who is also hiking the trail but dogs are not allowed in the Smokies so he is being boarded until the get through.
Tomorrow we reach the 200 mile mark and hike up Clingmans Dome, the highest point on the entire AT.  It’s s big day ahead with big climbs to look forward to.  We are tucked in our beds and one of the hikers has started a fire in the shelter fireplace...great ambience!!","Mollies Ridge Shelter

And so we did, getting on the trail early and making the most of another beautiful day. We arrived at Newfound Gap about 11am and plopped down on the grass to have a snack and call the kiddos. The tourists were out in droves and one in particular saw us and offered us some jive and bananas- much appreciated!
We enjoyed Newfound Gap for 2 reasons.  First, trail angels gave us fresh fruit.  Fruit and veggies don’t get eaten on the trail so this is a special thing. Second, they had bathrooms! Real bathrooms with toilets that “swoosh” rather than privies that “kerplunk”.   Bathrooms with running water are like  Christmas morning for thru hikers.
After a lengthy break, we got back on our feet and hiked on. The views again, were spectacular - the perfect sunny day allowed for visibility unlike anything I’ve ever seen before.  As awesome as the views were, the reality is that you have to earn those views. This trail gives nothing away, and getting to viewpoints such as these means hiking along ridge lines and mountaintops that are both unnerving and spectacular. I honestly don’t know how hikers do not die in some of these places. One step to the left or the right can mean a fall of hundreds of feet, with nothing to catch you except trees!  Not Curly’s favorite type of hike!

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588631,"What I’d like to address today has to do with our eating habits.  The previous night at dinner, 
We each ate a two serving dehydrated meal.  I asked Curly if she could eat a meal by herself and she said yes. We both ate good that night, but it served to remind me that “Hiker Hunger” has hit us both.  For the uninitiated, let me explain.
We burn about 6000 calories a day.  We eat maybe 3000 if we are lucky.  The deficit not only means weight loss (not necessarily a bad thing), but also means hunger (a bad thing).  Ravenous hunger. Hunger you think about constantly and find yourself eating everything in sight.  I would consider Curly and I to have great table manners.  Not anymore.  Ever drop something on the ground and call the “3 second rule?”  Doesn’t apply...if food hits the ground, it’s gonna get eaten no matter what it is or how long it’s been there. We’ve regressed to acting like infants, who put everything in their mouths.  Curly dropped some gummy bears on the ground and as I was picking them up carefully in order to eat them, to my horror she scooped them up dirt and all to throw away. Mortified I grabbed them and did my best to remove the dirt...crunchy gummy bears.  
It’s really crazy what we eat and how picky we aren’t. Any type of food will go with any other type of food.  Nothing is sacred and all food has suddenly become delicious.

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588660,"We woke up to a glorious sunrise this morning.  The shelter, our last one of the Smokies, faced due east, so we actually watched the sun light up the mountain range.  As glorious as it was, we were more than ready to get out of them...only 6 plus miles to unrestricted freedom.  You are required to stay at shelters in the Smokies and that severely impacts your hiking mileage each day.  Now we are free to hike and camp pretty much anywhere there is a durable surface.  It feels great!
We bailed out of camp at 730am and the first mile plus was a huge “up”, the Smokies farewell to us. We made great time heading north and our final stop was early lunch at Davenport Gap Shelter.  We finally found the southern entrance to the Smokies and as soon as we exited, the WHOA ladies (hiker mommas) had a huge tent and spread laid out for thru hikers!  We were in shock.  And soon to be in sugar/carb shock. These amazing ladies had all kinds of food, most of which I’ve been craving (DONUTS) for the past couple weeks.  We loaded up our plates and gorged on fresh fruit, donuts, fried chicken and ice cold coke. Washed it down with fun size snickers and threw chocolate mini donuts in my pack for breakfast tomorrow.  It was amazing and we both are grateful for the generosity.
We skipped down the trail and an hour later found ourselves at Standing Bear Farm Hostel, one of the most iconic places on the AT.  Totally hiker trash cool and for twenty bucks each you get a bunk, shower, and can hand wash your laundry with a scrub board!

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589031,"From the very start of the day I think we were both wondering how it would go.  It was great staying at the hostel, how can you go wrong with a shower and a mattress? Well, you could be on a top bunk where the guy in the bottom snores like a lumber mill running full bore for one. I’ve never heard so much snoring in one place at one time and led by primarily one guy.  Anyways, we got thru that and had a nice breakfast and checked out at 8am. We’re back on the trail by 845.
I’ve mentioned before that I’m not a fan of days where you go into town or get into a hostel early because as much as the rest is valued, I’m convinced that the body becomes soft and rebels against hard work the next day like trying to hike 15 miles, which was our plan.  We always struggle after these visits, and today was no exception.
It was a very difficult day for both of us.   Out of the gate we had a four mile “up” to Snowbird Mountain and Curly’s legs were like jello, she couldn’t get them going. Add to that the warmest day out here and trying to stay hydrated and we both were just doing our best to keep moving.  I was mad because we just got out of the Smokies yesterday and I couldn’t believe any Mountain was as difficult as those...and these were.  It’s incredibly humbling when mountains make mincemeat of men (and women), but they did today.  I don’t think we’ve taken as many breaks as we did today, and we decided at the 10 mile mark to forget about hiking 15, and let’s just get to Max Patch which would be 13.6 miles.
It was the wise choice to make because we can make up the other miles and the amazing weather will result in an incredible sunset on my side of the tent, and an incredible sunrise on Curly’s side of the tent. The vestibules face west and east, and the flaps will be up until it’s too cold.
Today was a huge test of our desire to be out here and the willingness to face whatever adversity that may present itself.  We both agree that there is nowhere else we would rather be, and no one else we would rather be doing this with.","StandingBear Hostel

So...we, along with five others caught a shuttle into town and we have just finished pigging out on pizza and kick in’ chicken.  And chips and salsa...and a slice of cheesecake.  We have pitched our tent alongside the French Broad River, and will be lulled to sleep by the sounds of the river.  Doesn’t get any better than that!

We got into town late Thursday afternoon and immediately got some food.   There was a bluegrass festival this weekend so lodging was slim, we ended pitching our tent just outside town on the French Broad River and let the waters lull us to sleep.  Friday was wait for the kids day, so we ate some more food, lounged around town and then in the afternoon enjoyed the mineral baths the town is famous for, decontaminating ourselves and getting just a tad bit presentable for the kids.  It was fun throughout the day running into and reconnecting with folks on the trail we haven’t seen in days.  Kids came and we were whisked away to an awesome AirBnB house just outside of town.  Sat on a hundred acres of woods with streams and it’s own serious waterfall!  Danny and Ginny are incredible hosts and we will definitely be back.  Saturday we explored the property with the grandkids, continued to eat well and did our town chores at REI and Ingles in Asheville and being visited by special guest Evan “that guy” Tice, 2017 AT thru hiker.  
Cooked up some steaks for dinner, repacked our gear and our now getting mentally prepped for the next leg of our journey to Erwin, about 70 miles.  Our plan then is to push for Roan Mtn, then to Damascus, where we might take a zero if we get there by Trail Days...we will just have to see how our legs are and whether this double zero weekend was good medicine for us or bad.","

We are making our push to Erwin and hope to be there by Thursday. Lots of work to be done and miles to be made.","Hot Springs

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589572,"We had one of the quietest nights on the trail last night; it’s amazing how peaceful the woods can be when you aren’t at a shelter.  We prefer to “dry camp”, which means we stop at a place that can be rented on, but doesn’t have a water source. It’s up to you to pack in water...it’s s great way to keep things quiet, because most people don’t like to camp where there isn’t water. We prefer it, so no problem.
We got on the trail with a forecast of rain and much to our surprise, there was sunshine!  And it stayed with us all day long.  Our goal was to get at least as far as Jerry’s Cabin Shelter, about 14 plus miles up the road, and hopefully a little further.  It was a weird hiking day, because the hiking was hard, but it wasn’t extreme. Rather, it wore us down because we were constantly going up with little relief.  At least for the morning portion. By the time we stopped for lunch, we had about seven miles under our belt and were feeling pretty good.
In the afternoon we had a completely different turn of events and found ourselves above tree line scrambling over rocks.  It was our first significant exposure to large rocks, and it requires a lot of focused thought and attention to detail.  It was a lot of fun, even though it was exhausting.  Curly loved it which made me glad as she typically gets scared at stuff like that.
The weather began to turn as we wrapped up this portion of today’s hike and we pushed harder to come off the ridge line and attempt to outrun the thunder and lightning.  It never came, at least not as I write this, but it gave us an excuse to call it a day earlier than planned.  But not before we passed the 300 mile point of this trip.  We set up camp and had a delicious Mountain House Meal and are now tucked into our tent for the night.  Tomorrow if terrain and weather permit, we will attempt our biggest mile of this thru hike yet!!","Little Paint Creek Trail

It was as if we were floating along this easy, comfortable trail.  The sun was out just enough to warm us up, the green was exploding in its spring time hues, and streams were everywhere, singing their morning song of welcome. We really moved down the trail in short order, having completed over 9 miles before lunch.  
But of course if something is too good to be true, it probably is, and at mile marker 310, the party was over.  The remainder of the afternoon was “make up” emphasis on the “up” for the easy part of the day. So we went up, and up, and up some more.  I will say though that both of us are getting stronger and while these ups are difficult, it’s simply a matter of one foot in front of the other.  Take your time, take breaks, and eventually you get to your destination... which we did.  Hiking for us didn’t end till 630pm, but we ended up hiking over 17 miles and are poised for a big day tomorrow which sets us up for an easy Thursday into Erwin.  And, tomorrow is Big Bald, one of our favorite places on the AT...I’m thinking early lunch at the top!","Jerry’s Cabin Shelter

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589779,"We woke up excited to be hiking over Big Bald today. This was our third visit over the past 5 years, and I would say was the place that really planted in us a seed for a future thru hike.  To be back here again was  very sentimental!
Funny thing though about memories...they are usually quite selective, and for some reason, all the pain and agony is somehow repressed for the memories of joy and satisfaction!  Honest to goodness, virtually none of our hike this morning bore any resemblance to the previous hikes.  It was just plain hard!  From our first step until we collapsed at the top of the Bald 4 hours after beginning, I swore up and down they rerouted the trail since we last hiked that section!  We ascended to over 5600 feet in elevation and it was all brand new to us!  But when we arrived, oh how glorious it was.  The views were spectacular, the sky clear as a bell, and we lingered over a long lunch, hating to give up what we had worked so hard for.
We hiked north after lunch, hoping to hike another 8 or 9 miles which would put us in striking distance of Erwin on Thursday.  The day went on and the miles piled up, but there were no tent spots to call it a day.  So we continued on until close to 7pm, when we drug ourselves into the shelter tenting area.  The place is slammed with hikers who have the same intentions we have for tomorrow.
We slammed down a dehydrated meal and some pretzels and raisenets and are now in the tent for the night.  Overall it was a very good day, and our biggest mileage day of this trip.  Tomorrow is an easy 6 miles to town and a shower, resupply, and town food!  Oh yeah gonna crush some Mexican food tomorrow...watch out chorri  burritos!","Stealth site .5 from Sams Gap

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590029,"It was an interesting day on a couple of different levels, the first of which was the trail angels we met. Coming into Indian Grave Gap we met Brother Tom and his canine companion Moses. During the hiker season they are at the same location every day Monday-Thursday and he gives out cold drinks, homemade bread or brownies, fruit, and chairs to relax in.  He is a Catholic “brother” who has been on the mission field for 37 years.  Great guy and I’m thankful he is out there loving on the hikers with the love of Jesus; it was a pleasure to spend some time with him.
After that we began our climb up to Beauty Rest, which is another bald that took our breath away...first because of the climb and second because it truly was beautiful!  Curly wanted to pitch a tent and stay overnite but it was only 2pm...just a bit too early!  Crazy thing tho, when we got to the top, the place was as remote and isolated as any place we have been to yet...and still there was an RV parked at the top and a sign “Free Ice Cream”. Never one to pass up free ice cream we moseyed on over and had the pleasure of meeting “Onesimus”, a Jesus loving, Hiker loving guy out following the hiker bubble with free ice cream and drinks. He is a thirty year retired Army vet, who lives in his RV and will drive from Georgia to Maine this year serving the hikers. We had a great talk with him and blessed him as we left.
For me tho, the highlight of the day was reaching the top of Unaka Mountain. It was spectacular...the top covered in a dense forest of Spruce trees. We hadn’t seen anything like this since the Smokies, and this stand of evergreens were magnificent. They must have been 40-50 feet tall and their needles blanketed the floor.  The smell was overpowering with a fresh pine scent and the coverage of the branches was so thick that the temperature must have been 15 degrees cooler in that stand than anywhere else.  Our biggest mistake was that we didn’t pitch our tent and make that our home for the night. We decided to walk a little further and see if we could find a site that had water...no luck. We ended up hiking 4 more miles to the shelter area we are now at, but totally regret not stopping then.
It was a great day and we got in some good miles, met some neat people and look forward to getting on the trail in the morning!","Erwin-Uncle Johnny’s

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590189,"So we got our usual early start at 730am, and by noon had covered almost half of the distance.  We were feeling pretty good, and even with the sun heating up we were covering good ground.  After lunch the terrain started getting more difficult, we could see Roan Mtn looming just ahead of us and were anticipating a very difficult climb. Around 230pm, we hit Hughes Gap, which is at the base of Roan...and much to our joy and surprise, Trail Magic!  Slug and Luigi, two thru hikers in 2016 had returned to do some trail magic, and it was crazy good!  Hot dogs, cold drinks, fruit, candy even toothpaste and batteries!  It was exactly what we needed to power up over 2,000 feet in elevation over the next five miles.  With satisfied tummies, we started climbing at 3pm, and for the next 3 hours that was all we did...climb! Fortunately, the trail was laid out nicely, with lots of switchbacks and places to regain your breath after difficult climbs.  It was hard make no mistake about that, but it was a fun ascent for once, and we really enjoyed the trail.
With daylight burning and our desire to be at the Bald by sunset, we hiked hard and going down was much quicker and shorter than going up. We hit Carvers Gap at 645pm and had our tent set up exactly where we wanted it by 730pm. With dinner complete and us in our bags, my flap is open and we have a clear, starry night to sleep by.  Tomorrow it’s 13 miles to Mountain Harbour BnB, then Monday it’s 5 hiking days to Damascus and trail days!","Cherry Gap Shelter

It was a magnificent evening for a brisk and cool sleep.  We awoke at six just as day was breaking over the eastern mountains, and we ate our breakfast as the sun rose up to greet us.  I recognize that every morning will not be just as this one was, so I’ll savor this one as a special memory.
The end of our day found us at Mountain Harbour hostel, a very cool place alongside a beautiful creek where we have pitched our tent tonight. They have a food truck on site as well as laundry services with brand new machines! I thought it was Christmas morning! You want to make a thru hiker cry with delight? Simply have all your washers and dryers in working order at the same time!  In addition to all that, we are clean and smell almost human, at least for tonight.  
Now...for everything in between the start and finish to this day, all I can say is “my hump”!  We climbed two significant mountains today, Little Hump and Big Hump.  These were not bumps or lumps or even humps.  These were huge, straight up, to the top mountains. The cool part was that they were bald, so no trees or forests; you could see the trail as it wound up and zig zagged across and up the mountain from start to finish.  Sadly, the cool factor ended the moment you took your eyes off the trail to see how far you had to go and instantly became dejected because you hadn’t even put a dent in the trail!  Curly and I simply plodded up Little Hump and took a pack off break when we summited.  Same with Big Hump, except that this mountain at least three additional levels where you thought you were making progress only to find there was still a lot more mountain to hike!  We did eventually reach the top, took our pack off break, and lingered for a while.  We knew we had to keep moving but it was hard not to enjoy the spectacular views.  And we were just pooped out!  I think that today was the first day that I was just “over” hiking about noon. I wanted the day to be finished and I wanted to just plop. I got that wish...but not until 4pm when we staggered into Mountain Harbour.  Once again, like every day, a difficult one.  At the same time, like every day, a glorious one.  Such is the life of a thru hiker (at least for us).

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590534,"Yesterday, pretty much all the hikers were telling us that staying for breakfast was a must do event.  But it also meant a later start than normal.  Stomach won out and we delayed our hike out time from the normal 730ish time to 915am!  But, it was so worth the time and money!  Fresh coffee, home made pastries, eggs, meats, breakfast tacos, There was French toast casserole that was so delicious. Potatoes, there must have been ten or twelve items to choose from and it was ALL YOU CAN EAT! Hello...anybody home?  So we and probably another 20 hikers who came out of the woodwork ate and ate.  A hiker came out of the woods, running down the road just to get breakfast.
So we waddled out of there with intentions of hiking 16-18 miles today.  I just gotta give up making plans.  Two hours into the hike we came to Jones falls so took a side trip and snack break for that...totally worth it.  Then coming into a Gap we came to a river whose name I don’t know, but we stopped to cool down and wade in it.  Totally worth it.  Then later in the day we came to Mountaineer Falls and of course had to stop for that. Totally worth it.  By 430 we were at Upper Laurel Fork River and had only gotten 12.7 miles up the trail on a very easy day of gentle grade.  But there were these incredible camp sites that were calling our name.  Totally worth it.
In life, with every decision we make, there are trade offs and sacrifices. For today, the miles we need to make to get to Damascus for trail days was the sacrifice.  We did cross the 400 mile mark today, and yesterday we wrapped up hiking in North Carolina.  2 states down and 12 to go.  All I can say about this day is that as I lay in my tent listening to the gurgling of the stream not ten feet from me, Curly is also next to me very happy.

Hands and feet prune up, you walk in rivers that used to be trail, your feet slosh, but the reality is that the miles don’t get done unless you walk.  So you hike on.  Which we did, all day long.
Finally at 3pm we caught a rain reprieve break. We stopped and cooked dinner early, and with fuel in our system, hiked out the last 4 miles of our day, giving us 15.9 for the day.  We are now 28.5 miles from Damascus so  the plan is to try and get 18-20 tomorrow (weather permitting with all day rain forecasted) which sets us up for a short day Friday into Damascus.  We shall see.

I was giddy with excitement because the forecast calls for rain every day through Saturday.  So we got around and hit the trail and the second amazing thing happened...no mountains to hike over! Say what? Yeah, no mountains for us today. Now that doesn’t mean we didn’t go up and down all day, it just means elevation and grade was like a dream today.  
Then the third cool thing happened...the sun came out just as we hit a meadow and so we pulled everything out of our packs that was wet (which was everything) and laid it out for the sun to dry while we snacked on chip crumbs, cause that’s all we got left to eat!
And it keeps getting better.  We get to hiking and come into a Gap and guess what? Trail magic!  I had a huge turkey and cheese sandwich and a banana. Then, as if it couldn’t get any better, it does. At the next Gap, more trail magic! This time pulled pork sandwich covered in slaw and ice cold pink lemonade...I mean, who needs to carry food?
At this point ya gotta figure SOMETHING is gonna give, and indeed it did. The rain came back, but we were full and didn’t care.

Current and former thru hikers and many others gather for a reunion weekend with lots of food and fun.  The big gun vendors are all there pitching their wares and selling hikers all the latest and greatest gear.  They get the attention of folks, and it’s a great atmosphere.
But the true rock stars of Trail Days are the churches that come from all over the south to partner with local churches and offer tangible and practice ministries that the hikers truly need like showers, laundry, and haircuts...all for free!  After 4 days of rain I can’t express how amazing and wonderful these folks were. They bring in disaster trailers that have showers in them or washers and dryers and they set them up for us to use. Drop off laundry and several hours later it’s finished!  And they do this because they love God and love people.  Many, many thanks to “One Way” ministries, the real rock stars of Damascus!

Today was also our fifth straight day of rain (yay) and it’s starting to get a bit annoying.  We did buy pack covers yesterday and they make a huge difference in keeping things dry for which we are really grateful for.  It rained off and on all day, and in spite of packing up a soaking wet tent this morning, we had a brief interlude of sunshine and so I pulled out all of our wet gear and dried it out.  Made a huge difference when we pitched a dry tent this evening.
The miles accumulated and we are now about 16 miles from Grayson Highlands State Park, which is where the wild ponies are.  I hear they like to lick the sweat off dirty hikers, of which I have plenty of both!  This will be a highlight of the trip for sure,especially if the weather improves.

Most folks really don’t think about stuff like that, but thru hikers do for sure.  Rain dictates whether people hike or stay put. It can determine where you pitch a tent or whether they stay in a shelter.  We met a guy who only hiked on non-rain days; I doubt he will get to Maine.

Having done a twenty yesterday, I was asking a lot of Curly, but she was up to it. I have to say, the Virginia terrain and the surprise of no rain worked in our favor...that and motivation for a small break!
The day itself was uneventful with little in the way of significant moments, but two things stood out worthy of note.  First the landscape change into Virginia.  This state is wildly diverse in its flora and fauna.  We hiked through entire mountainsides of ferns, green and luscious. It was incredible.  Likewise, one moment you were in a stand of pines and the next you were walking through wildflowers.  The rhododendrons have come into full bloom and vibrant colors of orange and purple are everywhere.  Truly a beautiful part of the trail.
The second moment for us occurred towards the end of the day when we came to a one room schoolhouse built in mid 1800’s and preserved for the benefit of hikers. It was exactly as it would have been then, with desks, chalkboard and everything.  And really cool was that inside there were crates with snacks and cold drinks courtesy of West End United Methodist Church!  They supply the goodies as a treat for they hikers which was greatly appreciated.
By this time of the day, we were out of close by options for tenting and I wanted to stop at The Barn, a restaurant off I-81 next to the trail.

As always, the trail presented some final challenges for us just prior to getting off trail, but in a good way.  For instance, we began our hike this morning by passing through a pasture of grazing cows. They decided we were not to pass through and as group (herd), all barreled out in front of us blocking our way.  Even leaving some reminders on trail to clarify who is boss.  Not to be intimidated by milk cows, I snapped my sticks together, gave them the stink eye (literally), and they returned to being easily spooked cows as we all know them to be.  The world began spinning on its axis once again.
The Virginia countryside is a marvel with the trail passing through mountain forests and countryside meadows.  We finally arrived at VA 610 just after noon and turned left down a country road.  There around the corner, was our place of rest, and the most gracious host you could hope for, Tina.  She is a thru hiker herself with a heart for smelly hikers and an incredible home touch. The property is vintage white brick colonial farm with sprawling meadows in front and forests in the back. No cell service or WiFi or TV which is all fine by me, even if these posts go up a bit delayed (sorry).  It is a place of rest and that is exactly what Curly and I need.
We have decided to remain here one extra day and rest our bodies.  Since we have begun this adventure, I’ve lost about 25 pounds and whatever upper body muscle I had is now absent. It’s all moved to the legs but I look emaciated, to the point that even I’m concerned. We both have worked our bodies hard and especially the feet. Miraculously, we have not had a single injury or blister, but the the feet need a day off. We did receive new shoes in the mail I ordered the other day, as our old ones are shot!    Thru hiking is great for quick weight loss but I’m just not sure it’s the healthiest way to do it!  
We also received 2 resupply from our trail bosses, the Remarkable, Amazing, Wonderful Lisa and Ed Gohn whom we love and adore and are so indebted to for a million reasons.  We are eating that food plus packing it up for our next leg of the journey.  The remainder of today and all day tomorrow is rest, I’ll post an update Thursday, and hopefully a pic or two of this amazing retreat.","I81 Relax Inn

The day held true to sunshine and beautiful blue skies for most of the day, and with our new shoes our feet felt great as we hiked through meadows and forests.  We stopped for lunch at this lazy river and next thing we knew there was a pool party taking place.  Bloodhound jumped into the river and was soon followed by Giggles,Happy Feet, Sticks, Dragonsticks, Frolic, Sunday and last but not least, Curly Turtle. With frisbee in hand the place got crazy fast and the water was oh so refreshing!  All of these hikers are new acquaintances we have only met in the past few days; young and having the time of their lives.  They make for great conversation around shelter picnic tables.  And they kindly include us old folks.
We marched along after lunch and with two big mountains to climb did our best to stay focused. I personally think the day off was exactly what our bodies needed, as we slowly but surely conquered both.  In the middle of the first “up”, I was passed by a guy who had an Australian accent. I did a double take and couldn’t believe my eyes, it was Spillover, who we hadn’t seen since our third day on the trail!  He and another guy, Drew, camped with us on our second night on the trail and once we got over Blood Mountain, never saw either again. And here’s Spillover with Drew not far behind. It’s so crazy how people just disappear on the trail and you think they are miles and miles ahead, then one sickness or injury or one too many zero days in town and you’re all back in the same bubble.  Definitely makes for some interesting stuff!
We ended up hiking just shy of 17 today which I’m pleased with, but we need to get a couple big days behind us as we get closer to Pearisburg.  Tonight we are camped up at high elevation so enjoying a nice breeze.  Tomorrow the rain returns and is supposed to be with us through all of next week-ugh!","Quarterway Inn

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591916,"We actually got in close to three hours of hiking before the skies opened up.  Umbrellas and hiking skirts make all the difference, but rain always impacts mileage, to the negative.  We stopped at a shelter for a hot lunch and to wring out a bit.  The rain finally slowed down to a trickle about 2pm and we used that time to step on the gas.  We had heard of a hiker “deli” just off the trail at the 19 mile point, and we had hot food on the brain.  Didn’t know what the hours were, but figured they would close around six pm, which meant we needed to hike close to 8 miles in a whole lot faster time than we normally do.  We actually arrived at 515pm!  And of course it’s Saturday which means they close at 2pm! Talk about disappointment? We were bummed, but because we hustled, we got to our campsite about 30 minutes later and ate instant mashed potatoes as a consolation prize!
We get a second chance tomorrow with Trent’s Groceries, another hiker deli about 18 miles from here. They don’t close til 8pm on Sundays, so I think we should be ok.  Then on to Pearisburg for a shower and resupply. Of course the rain is scheduled to keep on falling for the next several days (so what else is new?)","mm 572 Tent Site

 We hit the 600 mile mark!
The rain did not come at noon or at all today!
We made it to Trent’s Grocery at 4pm and ate the most delicious, greasy, yummy food ever...totally made up for yesterday!
We snagged an incredible tent site at Dismal Falls and as I journal now, I can hear the Falls cascading down and can’t wait to let them put me to sleep!
We have an incredible 2 person rock to sit on at our camp site; I know it’s weird but it’s the little things that make a difference!
Last, we got to clean up and get some stink off at the Falls. They have some incredible swimming holes here, that’s twice in three days the rivers have been good to us!

So you can see, today was full of awesomeness and we are looking at what could very well be a no rain day tomorrow.  That’s what we are praying for as it gets us within striking distance of Pearisburg and all the great things towns offer...including “all you can eat” Chinese restaurant (so I’m told).  If it’s true, then Katie bar the door cause I’m ready to crush me some Sesame Chicken!","mm 592

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592279,"We made good time in the morning with overcast skies and rain holding off.  The terrain over the first six miles was flat and easy. We pushed on and over our first “up” and stopped for lunch at 1pm. 
As soon as we finished lunch the rain began and we started contemplating our options.  Our tent was wet from the previous night and I wasn’t thrilled about pitching it wet for tonite.  There was a shelter just 4.5 miles from our lunch spot but it increases our distance to town from 6 to 8.5 miles.   In the end we decided to stop early and it was probably a good call. As much as we dislike shelters, we are dry tonite, and are hanging out with a full shelter of wet and smelly hikers (including us).
Tomorrow we will arrive in Pearisburg before lunch. Can’t wait to take a shower, get our laundry clean and eat!","Dismal Falls

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592292,"It was wonderful being in a shelter last night. No mice, no snoring, and no wet!  It rained all night long but we and five others were dry and warm. Of course we needed to get going and hike in it, but that isn’t anything I’ve written about previously, right? 
We warned the gang that we were early risers and by 545am were moving our gear and getting ready for the mad dash to town. Just after 7am we took off and with 8.5 miles to hike plus another mile from the trailhead, we had town food and hot showers to keep us focused.
Speaking of focused, it is so important to pay attention to what you’re doing on this trail, especially when it’s so wet and mucky.  Most of our hike was downhill which was awesome, but several days of rain have turned the trail into a sloppy mess. Yesterday, Curly fell twice and today I rolled an ankle.  It was probably the most dangerous descent we have had on the trail to date, but nothing was going to keep us from town.  We hiked the 8.5 miles in just over 3 hours and hit the main road at 1030am.  It was then that the real fun, as in finding a room for the night, began.  What we didn’t know was that there are gas lines being laid in town and all the contract pipe fitters have all hotel rooms booked up through the work week. The rain has driven hikers inside as well, so the only two hostels were booked. I started with them and was put on a bunk list. Called a hotel number one, no luck. Called hotel number two, and someone had just checked out a day early...score!  I reserved the room and we made the long walk into town. Miss Linda the manager there set us up and told me to turn over all our dirty clothes so she could wash them. Whaaaat? Trail magic as well? I’m liking this town more by the minute. We then crossed the street to get all you can eat Chinese buffet and the sign out front said, “Tuesday special, lunch $5.39”!  Oh my gracious, I am now loving this place. We ate and ate and ate some more then crawled next door to the Food Lion to resupply. Bought more food than we probably need for 4 days then went to the room and showered and took a nap, yes you read that correct.  Woke up and ate Mexican for dinner, a huge DQ Blizzard for dessert and now my belly hates me very very much.  DQ opens at 6am and I’ll be there for coffee and something else then we hit the trail again with rain forecasted the rest of the week.  Tell you what...I won’t report weather anymore unless it’s NOT raining, that way you can just presume it’s raining!!!
All in all a great town day and we are both very thankful to have it.  Next up is a dash to Catawba and 4Pines Hostel this Saturday when we get to meet up with great friends Ben and Staci Cosby from home. They will be hiking with us Sunday and Monday and we can’t wait to spend this time with them.  Should be another great adventure!!","Doc Knob Shelter

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592887,"We needed to hike over 15 miles on this day and it was a bit of a challenge.  Naturally the weather was a factor, but terrain played a large part in the second half of the day.  I mentioned earlier two different AT’s.  The second AT introduced itself to us as we approached Dragon’s Tooth later that afternoon.  The challenges of rock scrambling in the rain are many, And the person who laid out this section of the trail must have been in a really bad mood at the time. I’ve never felt I was in as much danger as yesterday as Curly and I attempted to navigate our way down the rock faces of this mountain. There were few easy ways to step down, and most times as you descended you simply prayed your feet and hands found their mark.  If I could meet the designer of this portion I wouldn’t shake his hand and thank him. No, I would have to restrain myself from inflicting pain on that individual.  We were supposed to be finished hiking by 330pm and instead crawled off the mountain at 5pm. Our pace slowed to a mile per hour the last 3 miles.
And for the first time since beginning this adventure I actually wanted to quit. I was surprised at my frustration and anger and knew I needed to follow my own advice and before quitting have a hot meal and a good nights rest...which we did!  In the midst of a tough day however, some amazing things happened:  we crossed the 700 mile mark which is so amazing to me.  We got to 4 Pines Hostel and got a hot shower.  We ate dinner at the Home Place which was amazing.  Best of all though, Ben and Staci Cosby met us and we are together for the next two days. It is awesome to meet up with friends who will hike with us for a couple days; they brought us lots of goodies and just being with them is a huge morale booster.  We are so glad they are here and can’t wait to share this trail thanks them!
Tomorrow we head north to McAfee’s Knob and then on to Daleville the next day.  Should be an incredible adventure!","mm 688.4

We had a fairly easy 10 plus mile day planned, and the Cosby’s brought great with them!  For the first time in recent memory, we woke up to blue skies, rising sun, and excitement for the day. We wanted to Ben and Staci as full a thru hike experience as possible and the day did not disappoint. We took our time making miles through the day, and came to Johns Spring Shelter where we had lunch.  They got to meet some hikers we knew (DNA and Slack Rack) and then we headed back out for McAfee’s Knob, one of the most well known and most photographed places on the AT. It was absolutely incredible!  The weather made for remarkable views, so amazing that I have  rated this location most spectacular view on the AT to date. We hung out there for a good while, snacking and talking with other hikers before moving on.  
Curly will tell you what came next was the best part of her day...getting to camp early!  We arrived at our camp site just before 4pm, set up, then chilled out the rest of the night. It ended up looking like tent city because so many thru hikers wanted to stay there and catch either a sunset or a sunrise.  We got to meet or talk to Sunny Swissy, Rebel Yell, Silver Bullet, Stealth, Scissors, Sparky, Papa Smurf, MAGA, and there were another dozen I don’t know. All in all a great day to be with the Cosby’s, and I hope a great day for them.  Tomorrow we do 15.5 miles and head into town, but not before we see some incredible views from Tinker Cliffs!","4 Pines Hostel

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593095,"We decided not to catch the sunrise at McAfee Knob this morning, but instead get a fairly early start for Daleville instead.  Our little campsite was a beehive of activity beginning at 530am with so many folks hustling to go back up to McAfee’s Knob for the sunrise. We opted to break camp instead and we were out just after 7am.
It was a great day for hiking with cool breezes blowing throughout the morning. Four miles into our day we arrived at Tinker Cliffs, which in many respects rivaled yesterday’s views.  Lingering there with snacks, we pushed on and hiked mountain tops pretty much all day.  Ben and Staci hiked strong all day, and the terrain and grade were in our favor pretty much the whole way.  About three miles from Daleville, we caught sight of the town and surrounding area and made our final push. Right around 5pm we emerged from the woods onto the main drag of town and our hotel was practically in front of us...such excitement!
We got cleaned up and jumped into their van for a quick ride to Olive Garden. Two items to note. First, it’s incredible how you can drive in 15 minutes a longer distance than you can hike in one day, especially on the interstate.  Second, Olive Garden is good food and I had almost forgotten how delicious salad can be.  With bellies full (almost), we got dropped off at the Supermarket for resupply and we were in so long Ben sent Staci inside to make sure we hadn’t been abducted by aliens!  It’s hard to buy 4 days worth of food that is lightweight, calorie dense, and in an unfamiliar store.  With that finally completed, we stopped at Sonic for ice cream (naturally), then back to the hotel.
Curly and I went to bed with full tummies, and very grateful hearts for such a wonderful day with Ben and Staci.  They have been so good to us in so many ways and our little adventure with them is a definite highlight of our trip thus far.","Pig Farm Campsite mm 713.7

With no deadlines or requirements to attend to, it was a beautiful and easy kind of day.  We did lunch around 130pm and wrapped up our day at 5pm in front of Wilson Creek Shelter.  Tonight we are tenting and so is everyone else. Nobody uses the shelter when the weather is nice, so we have probably a dozen or more tents including a Girl Scout group as well.
Remarkably, we have been on this trail for 8 weeks!  It seems like only yesterday when we were at home planning and dreaming about this trip.  Now we are over a third of the way finished!  Our next town will be either Glasgow or Buena Vista depending on our miles hiked the next 3 days. Either way is good as it sets us up to meet our kids over Fathers Day Weekend.  Tonite we are warm and snuggled in to our tent.","Daleville

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593307,"Today was one of those days that totally redeem all other bad days combined.  We got an early start on the day and spent a large part of the day walking alongside or across the Blue Ridge Parkway.  We came out of the woods about 9am and came upon trail magic!  Luke, an older gentleman was giving out fruit and water, and there was a trash can there as well!
We hiked on for a couple hours and at noon we stopped at Virginia 43 state road and just plopped down and started eating lunch.  Within minutes, Sparky, Squirrel, and Bryan stumbled out of the woods.  While we were talking, a car drove up and the lady on the passenger side rolled down her window and asked us if anyone wanted a cold pop? Yes please and thank you very much.  Turns out she and her husband have been meeting their son (who is hiking the AT) at crossroads and were on their way to Tennessee to their cabin when they saw us. Trail magic #2!
Sparky then told us of a swimming hole only 7 miles away on the trail, and it was a hot, sunny day, so we booked it for Jennings Creek and arrived just before 4pm.  We immediately jumped in to the freezing yet refreshing water.  It was bone chilling cold, but it felt so good to get off the sweat and grime.  We played around for about an hour, and in that time, Sparky, Squirrel, Bryan, Boston Pops, Pussycat, and two other hikers showed up, we had a great time!
With a little more time and energy still left, Curly Turtle and I dried off and headed out for the last shelter of the day, about 4 miles from where we were.  It was a big “up” that wrapped up our day and we were too late to snag a tent site. So this evening we are in a double decker shelter sprawled out and almost passed out with exhaustion.  We are now snuggled into our sleeping bags ready to call it a day.","Wilson Creek Shelter

You never know which one will show up!  Same thing with the AT in  Virginia.
We began our day by climbing a mountain and ended our day the same way.  In between was enough elevation change to make us think we were back in the Smokies.  It was a challenging day from a hiking stand point, but it was also a good day, not a bad one.
Weather was absolutely perfect again, and got that we are always thankful.  Curly and I got to see a huge Barred Owl in broad daylight...all I can say is WOW!  They are truly magnificent birds. I didn’t realize how large they get.  Curly also flushed a momma grouse off her nest just off trail and about startled her to death!  
It took a little longer than we would have liked to get into camp, but when we did, it is a lovely, grassy spot and about a dozen hikers have pitched their tents for tonite.  The sunrise here should be wonderful.  Tomorrow we are hoping to hike about 18 miles or so and hitch into Glasgow instead of Buena Vista on Saturday.

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593543,"Fortunately, this day was a challenge, and yet went very well, particularly given the fact that we were going over Apple Orchard Mountain and Bluff Mountain, two of the highest elevation mountains in Virginia.  On the plus side for us, we did the first one in the morning and the second one late in the day, so they were spaced apart.  The second blessing is that the saying “ignorance is bliss “ is truly a correct saying given that we learned after the fact that as we were hiking over Bluff Mountain, there was a den of venomous copperhead snakes at stone steps leading to the top and they never showed themselves while we were hiking...or if they did, we were too exhausted to notice!  We spoke with thru hiker Kudzu who went over the mountain the same day as us and she saw several in the same locations that we hiked!  I’m no interested in seeing them at any point in our hike, but this is another reminder of the Lord watching out for us.
We finally arrived at the shelter right around 6pm and hustled to get our camp set up, as thunder was making its presence known. Then the rain came down during dinner and again later in the evening.  The most interesting part of the evening was when we went to bed.  Some type of insect or animal began making its night time noise and I’ve never heard anything like it before. It sounded like somebody on an oxygen tank trying to squeeze out their last breath!  Amazing sound and it was repeated in multiple locations all night long.  I’m determined to find out what that was.
We ended up hiking over 18 miles and are hoping to catch a ride in the morning into town.

We finally reached Oma, who picked us up at the Blue Ridge Parkway only a half mile from where we spent the night! I really wanted to get to 800 miles today, but a shower, laundry, and hot food over-red my quest to get over the 800 mark!
By 10am we were settled into our hotel rooms and walking to Buena Vistas premier breakfast joint, “TNT’s” place and we weren’t disappointed.  My gosh we hit the jackpot! This place has a breakfast buffet only on Saturdays (which was today), and it was incredible. We stuffed ourselves silly then went back to the hotel to clean up and get resupply for next 4 days. Sadly,nobody in the town sold propane for our stove, so we are going stoveless for the next 5 days! I’m none too thrilled about it but stay tuned.
The rest of the day was filled with naps, more food and hanging out with hikers Sparky, Squirrel, Bryan, Kudzu, and Gigi.  Curly Turtle split s quart of  Amish ice cream for dessert and I’m laying here stuffed to the gills.  We stopped at Subway to make a sandwich that will be our lunch and dinner tomorrow.  All in all a great ending to a great day.  Tomorrow we get picked at 9am and this continues this great adventure!","Punchbowl Shelter

Second look and it was a snake, our first encounter with a poisonous one, a Copperhead!  I tried to nudge him along into the woods further from the trail but he wasn’t having any of that.  He actually recoiled and faced us down, ready to strike if we bothered him any further.  I figured this was his real estate not mine, so we opted to leave the area...snake wins!
With a four mile up in front of us and storm clouds rolling in, along with thunder, we got moving on the mountain.  Once again, we couldn’t beat the weather and got ourselves soaked in the afternoon not once, not twice, but three times!  By the time we rolled into the shelter both Curly and I were done for the day.  And if that’s not enough of a smack in the teeth, we have to go stoveless this week (no cooking) because not one single merchant in Buena Vista sold gas in cans for hiker stoves. Not a single one! So everything we eat this week is cold, and...because I lost my bear bag rope to hang food, tonite our bags are locked in the shelter privy hopefully untouched by bears or mice.  And now you know why this is the Crazy Train!

As each mountain was summited we got more and more excited. It seemed like hikers from all over were trying to get to the same place.  With every bit of our remaining energy we arrived at Reeds Gap at 230pm, with a shuttle arranged by the Brewery for 330pm. But we didn’t want to wait an hour if we didn’t have to.  So we deployed Curly Turtle to stick out her thumb and see if we could hitch a ride.  I know, the very thing that your mom told you NEVER to do, she was doing!  And it was fun to watch. Over the next 45 minutes, she got vehicles to stop and little by little our hiking crew found their way to the Brewery!
When we arrived, they had tent sites available for us to use, for free!  Bathrooms, a place to wash up, even an electric pole with outlets for  charging phones was available.  The food was crazy good, a little too crazy good for me.  I didn’t mention in yesterday’s entry that I popped a crown off while eating a piece of candy. I texted my amazing daughter in law Danielle and asked her to see about getting me an appointment on Thursday with a dentist in Waynesboro to glue it back on. She did but there is now a slight problem.  I put the crown back in its place in my mouth and only chewed on the opposite side of my mouth.  You know where this is going.  While eating this incredible dinner at the Brewery, I swallowed my crown!  Don’t know how that happened but it did! Like I said, you can’t make this up.  The good news is that I haven’t lost it, I know exactly where it is.  The bad news is also that I know exactly where it is!
Not being able to do anything about it, we resolved to enjoy the rest of the evening with our little trail family because this is the last night we will all be together.

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594160,"Two sad moments to report today. First, we said goodbye to our little trail family of Sparky, Squirrel an Bryan. It was a sweet but short lived two weeks of fun with them, but the fact was that we are going off trail for two days to enjoy grands and Father’s Day weekend.  They will be way ahead of us by the time we head out on Sunday morning. We have loved being with them; each one a special character in their own right. Lots of laughs all the way around.
The second sad moment is that I have called off the search party for my crown.  Hiker trash thinking set aside, I’ve decided I really wouldn’t keep that crown even if I did find it. You can probably visualize why. Hopefully there is some sense of my dignity in retaining in all of this!
So we hiked just a tad over 14 today with a 5 mile shot into town in the morning.  It was an easy day and the weather was spectacular. Of course our dispositions always improve with sunshine and the prospect of being with family.  I’ll let you know how the dental visit goes tomorrow!","Reeds Gap

We let the kids know where we were at and then hung out, waiting for them to arrive. About 1045am Caleb, Danielle and Eli showed up and we were on our way...to 5 Guys for lunch! Nothing like two double burgers and fries to take the hunger edge off.
I still had a date with the dentist so we hustled to the house and I showered up and brushed my teeth...not wanting to offend the good citizens of Waynesboro. I was a bit apprehensive about what the dentist would recommend, given that my crown was still lodged somewhere between my large intestine and my colon!
The folks at the dental office asked me straight away if I had the crown “in hand” and smiled...everyone is having a great laugh about this one.  What we ended up deciding was to have a “sedative filling” which is a topping over the nub of tooth that the crown rested on. It sits lower than the rest of my teeth so it’s not functional, but it prevents infection and allows my dentist to figure out a next course of action once we return. A solution that cost $186.00!  I wasn’t complaining, just happy to be trail ready again.
Got back to the house with Curly’s home made spaghetti on the stove and Hannah, Sam and the kids on the way. By 6pm our stomachs were filled with food, and our hearts were filled with joy to have all the grands in one place.  Tomorrow the fun continues and we can’t wait!","Paul Wolfe Shelter

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594696,"We said goodbye to the kids and grands after a nice weekend off trail. Ate tons of delicious food and slept in a nice cushy bed.
The first day back was difficult, as it typically is.  Especially for Curly. Her body ached all over and her hips gave her a difficult time.  Fortunately the ascents were mild and while we hiked a bit over 16 miles, which is a great first day back, it didn’t feel that bad.  The weather held out for us also, which was really nice!
We ended up at a stealth spot about a mile further than planned, and that is because we are now smack dab in the middle of a hiker bubble.  As we were falling asleep, I was startled by a noise where our food was hung.  Turns out it was deer coming into our camp area to graze on their favorite greens. I yelled at them to go away and surprisingly they did.

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594698,"Summer has definitely arrived in Virginia, and today was proof. I don’t know how hot it got, but once the morning coolness wore off, we were feeling it!  Fortunately for us, the terrain was very mild today, so the miles piled up in spite of the heat. Also, we stopped at Loft Mountain Camp store and ate a burger and a coke there.  Any food you don’t have to grab from your bag tastes delicious.
As much as I love summer, there are two negatives about it that I don’t like...the first is the gnats!  My goodness it is gnat season and they look for orifices to visit. Eyes, nose, ears, mouth, they don’t care they just want in! Our tent is our refuge from these nasty insects.the second negative about summer is “monkey butt”.  For those of you unfamiliar with that term, I’m talking about chafing in the rear end area.  I’ll spare you the gory details, but let’s just say that you can’t hike very well when each step feels like your rubbing sandpaper between your cheeks (not facial-the other ones).  Add in non stop sweat and you have a recipe for pain, lots of pain.  Nothing like a full blown case of road rash on and in your gluteus maximus to make you walk like a preening peacock (does the imagery help?).
In spite of the obstacles, we had a great day.  Store food, early day into camp, and fairly easy miles made for a good day.  We are in our tent tonite with flaps open and looking forward to all that is in store for us tomorrow.","Tent Site mm 879.2

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594715,"Not quite sure how to describe this day...a little bit hard and a little bit easy.  A lot of heat and a fair amount of rain.  Old faces and friends long gone, but new faces and new friends taking their place. I guess we are experiencing some change out here. And that’s ok,  because it spices things up.  For Curly and I both, change out here is a good thing.
The weather today got to pretty much everyone. The morning was spectacular with a strong breeze and blue skies. We were out of camp before 7am and worked hard to get in as many miles as possible before the heat kicked in.  Our ultimate goal was Lewis Mountain Campground which meant cold drinks and a short 9 mile hike the next day.  We stayed focused till 11am, and then the heat prevailed.  Everybody slowed down, and we started carrying more water. I wouldn’t say we were wishing for rain (that comes later), but a little break from the heat would not disappoint anyone.  
That break didn’t come until 4pm, when the skies opened up and flooded the trail in a matter of minutes. We were already pressing to get to the Campground before the store closed at 6pm, and this deluge definitely slowed us down further.  I saw my ice cold Gatorade slipping from my fingers!
So we pressed on and by 530pm just made it to the camp store with minutes to spare. We loaded up on food, then found a camp site and parked ourselves for the evening. Rain stopped right after and we got to pitch a dry tent-yay.  We invited Bamboo and Uncle Yah to pitch their tents as well, so we are all in our tents and looking forward to a great day tomorrow!","Pinefield Hut

We only had 8.8 today before we hit our destination, Big Meadows Lodge.  Took our time breaking camp and actually relaxing a little bit, something I’m still working on!  Hit the trail at 8am and enjoyed every mile of it.  Couple of “ups” and before noon we were at Big Meadows Wayside, where we ate lunch and resupplied to get us to Saturday.  Hiked into the Lodge and our room was waiting for us!!  Showered, napped and before we knew it, it was dinner time. 
I also want to comment on how grateful we are for the room and opportunity to clean up, especially since the rain has been coming down in buckets.  We are livin’ large and thankful, oh so thankful for the generosity of others.
We wrapped up the evening with turkey dinners at the restaurant and a huge sundae which we shared. It’s off to bed and sweet dreams, knowing that tomorrow brings more rain...but that’s for tomorrow!","Lewis Mountain Campground

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595084,"Our first “goal” of the day was 8 miles in and Skyland Resort.  That meant cold drinks and hot sandwiches for lunch.  Curly drank coffee this morning and the caffeine was just what the doctor ordered!  We hiked those miles in record time and enjoyed a nice break along with the nice smelling tourists.
With 11 miles to hike and rain looming on the horizon, we stepped out for our afternoon hiking.  The weather was overcast all day which really was a blessing, and the terrain was definitely in our favor.  We made good time and as we were almost at the top of Mary Mountain, we encountered our first bear of this hike.  It was s cub, cute as can be and didn’t weigh more than 75 pounds, a little pipsqueak.  There was just two problems with this.  First, he was not scared or intimidated by us whatsoever, which can create problems getting them to move along.  After all, he was on the trail and we needed to pass by. Second problem, is that where there’s a cub, there is usually a momma, and we didn’t see her, so we didn’t know if we were between them, which is deathly serious. So...I told Curly to take a picture which she never got a good one, only the body but no head, and then I tried shooing him, which he finally did do, leaving the trail for the woods.  Then I told Curly that we were going to make a dash and move on from that area before momma showed up, which we did.  I was actually hoping that we would get through Shenandoah without seeing a bear, I really have no interest, and then we get to see Boo Boo.  Later in the afternoon as I was ahead of Curly and coming down a mountain, I had a young adult bear come crashing across the trail in front of me moving like greased lightning!  Two bears in one day.
We ended up reaching the Hut (huts and shelters are the same thing) right after 6pm, pretty standard for us, only tonite we are staying in the Hut because rain is expected to come hard, in amounts between 1-2 inches of rainfall tonite. Don’t want to be out in that in our tent, and right now it is coming down hard.  We are in the Hut with 8 other thru hikers, 7 of which we never met til today.  It is expected to rain all night and all day tomorrow so we are planning on getting good and wet.  But for now, we are dry, warm and have full tummies!  Oh the life of a hiker.","Big Meadows Lodge

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595085,"In spite of the rain, today was a great hiking day.  We made good miles and the rain kept the temps down and the bugs at bay. Our rain gear (skirt, umbrella and jacket) worked well and we got to our campsite a little after five, then hurriedly set up camp and ate dinner. The food is all hung up high and we are in dry and warm sleep clothes.
Another reason why today was a good day was because we got to eat at another Park restaurant. I’ve mentioned pretty much every day that we have had hot food and cold drinks almost daily in SNP. And today was no exception.  We have literally eaten our way through the Park, and it’s been great.  Expensive, but great.  We have carried less food in our packs, reducing weight, and I think that has contributed to some big mile days. Hot food also lifts your spirits, especially on a day like today when I got eggs, sausage, coffee and a huge gooey cinnamon bun on a crummy and wet day.  It hasn’t been cheap eating this way, but we planned for this from the very beginning so it’s all good.  I wouldn’t change a thing!
Tomorrow at noon we get picked up by our amazing friends the Gray’s, and we meet up with other lifelong friends from this area for a meal and great time of fellowship.  Sunday we hit the trail and expect to go over 1000 miles on Monday and into Harpers Ferry early Wednesday for our picture at the AT Conservancy.  We just keep trucking along and loving almost every moment!","Pass Mountain Hut

That, however did not dampen our mood because we were going to spend the afternoon with great friends that we have known for almost 30 years. Our kids grew up together, we vacationed together and spent a lot of our adult lives together. This was a special day that did not disappoint!
We woke up wet, we packed out wet, but the rain finally quit long enough for us to hike the three miles to the hostel.  We showered, got laundry done and then were whisked off to meet our friends.  An awesome lunch with great conversation ensued and there were many laughs around the table. Thank you so much Danny and Nancy; Ernie and Dawn; and Keith and Laura for being so kind and gracious to us.  Your friendship means the world to Curly and I.
After lunch, Danny and Nancy took us around town to resupply, pick up some new gear, and one final run to KFC for takeout dinner.  We got back to the hostel and our food bags are now bursting at the seams in large part to the amazing care package sent to us via Kathy and Ron Lane (thanks guys!).  No more eating out until the bags are empty!

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595224,"After a great day with friends and a night in the hostel, we were both ready to hit the trail this morning. We headed out at 715am and by 730am we’re back in the trail. It was weird hiking without any required goals or places we absolutely needed to be heading toward...it felt real good, with the exception of extra heavy food bag!
We covered the first 9 miles by noon and stopped at Jim and Molly Denton Shelter, without question the nicest shelter on the AT to date.  This place had a deck with Adirondack chairs, an outdoor shower, horse shoe pit, pavilion with picnic tables under it, flowers planted around the deck and shelter, and a privy that was nicer than virtually every hostel bathroom since we started hiking!  I so wish we had hit this place at 5pm instead of noon...but we didn’t, and so a long break was as good as it would get!
And don’t ya know, as doin as we left the skies darkened and the thunder rolled in.  Even when it’s 30 percent chance of rain might as well bank on it if you’re hiking!  Sure enough, the skies opened up and for the next hour or more we hiked in that condition we have become so accustomed to; wet.  Fortunately we hit a road crossing and trail magic awaited us...and that will always make things right.  “Summer Camp” thru hiked last year and was out blessing the 2018 hikers with food, fruit and cold gatorades and cokes; it was wonderful!  We hung out in the pouring rain eating food and chatting up other hikers for a half hour or so then pressed on.
Our original plan was to do 19 miles but when we hit Manassas Gap Shelter at 430pm, just 4.5 miles. short, we decided to just call it a day.  Sun came out, we dried most of our wet gear and we are only 2 of 3 people at the shelter tonite.  Papa Smurf is with us and do are good times.  We decided to sleep in the shelter tonite because of the forecast...we will be dry and comfortable tonite.  We will make up the miles tomorrow and still cross the thousand mile barrier.  Hard to conceive that we have actually hiked this far. We are planning out our next 200 miles and looking so forward to the sites and activities in front of us.","Front Royal Terrapin Station Hostel

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595383,"We got a little bit of a late start as I let Curly sleep in a bit later than usual. Our feet were on the trail at 745am (I know, crazy that’s late!) and we made some good morning miles in the beautiful, cool but sunny morning.  We hiked through Sky Meadows State Park and it was stunning! I would definitely go back there to see and experience more of it.  We sat down on a bench at a four trail intersection around 11am and a young man, his preteen son and elderly mother in law walked up.  We got up to give them the bench as we were done with our lunch, and the lady asked us, “how far are you going?”  I told her, “to Maine.”  Her eyes lit up and she remarked she never met a thru hiker in her life and always wanted to hike part of the AT.  She had asked her son in law to bring her here and he did. A great conversation ensued and by golly I think Curly and I got a bigger kick out that lady than she did us.
Well, with our 15 minutes of fame having expired, we said goodbye and continued north...we had more miles to hike and a big milestone to crack.  The afternoon rolled along as we closed in on that 1,000 mile mark and about 3pm, something happened we totally didn’t expect...we entered the “Roller Coaster”,  a 13.5 mile long series of ups and downs that I had heard about, but never gave it much thought.  I sure wish I had paid more attention, because I can tell you that we were not going to get to a thousand miles without a kick in the teeth from Virginia.  Those hills came at the end of a long mile day and we both started dragging.  Up one hill then down another, with mud and rocks to slow us down and trip us up.
The day was getting much longer than I had expected, and finally at 6pm we hit the big 1,000!  Took pics and kept moving.  Finally reached camp at 7pm and now it’s 9pm and I’m just getting to journal.  The good news is that no rain expected tonight so vestibule flaps are up.  So yeah, it was an interesting day in a very good way.  Tomorrow we shoot for 19 more miles and then 4 miles into Harpers Ferry.

Thru hiker Invisible Man explains it like this: type 1 fun is fun while you are doing it, and fun when you remember it.  Type 2 fun is not fun when you are doing it, but will be remembered as fun.  Type 3 sucked when you did it and still sucked when you remembered it.  For now, this roller coaster is type 3 fun...and I’m glad it’s over. As I mentioned yesterday, we split it in half, hoping that a new morning and fresh legs would speed up the completion.  The legs were fresher but it still took us 5 hours today (with 2 breaks) to finish, and with 19 plus miles planned it put us at a disadvantage, but we hiked through all that and made the most of what was a glorious day, in Virginia and in West Virginia, which we crossed over today.  That’s 4 states completed!
One of the best parts of the day was getting to Sweet Spring Store just off the trail at the 17 mile point.  It took us literally all day to get there, but it was so worth it. Besides stocking up on all the snacks we were plumb out of, they had a deli that blew me away!  I had a club sub that was 8 inches long and so full of meat I could only eat half...and this from a guy who has lost 27 pounds since this hike began. Now I also had 5 big chicken tenders, a Gatorade and a coke and one of Curly ‘s deviled eggs...and a chocolate shake, but I can’t wait for breakfast tomorrow! One huge honking sub to start my day.
So we filled up literally and high tailed it to the trail with about an hour of daylight left and two miles to our site.  One mile in, I noticed an old abandoned camp site so we just pulled in there and set ourselves up.  It leaves us with an easy 5 miles into Harpers Ferry in the morning. We will check in at the Conservancy, get our new numbers and hike out. The plan is to make up some miles for the ones we slowed down for this past week.  By Thursday we will hitch in to Boonsboro for laundry and another resupply.  Definitely a most excellent day!","Sam Moore Shelter

We woke up at our stealth site looking forward to getting into Harpers Ferry.  Making a quick stop at the AT Conservancy and grabbing a cup of coffee then out to the trail. Yeah, no.  We hit town about 945am and dropped our packs, got our pictures taken and new numbers assigned (1135/1136), and that’s where the plan took a turn. MY plan was to grab a coffee and sandwich at the closest coffee shop and go get some miles. No need to waste time in the city.  Curly’s plan was to walk the town, see some sites, grab lunch THEN hit the trail.  Apparently we didn’t communicate our plans to each other...so we first executed my plan, except for leaving town, then we executed her plan.  Three hours later we were moving on.  Everyone was happy.
When we crossed the Potomac River leaving town, we also left West Virginia and entered Maryland. Five states down and nine to go. WV was good to us...short and sweet.  We climbed up and out of the city and back into the woods with rain threatening.  It spit on us a time or two, but we lucked out. What concerned us more was the deluge predicted for tonight, up to 3/4 inch of rain! So, another Curly win, we stopped at the first shelter out of town and was set up by 430pm! We are in the shelter tonite and it is full. Surprisingly, only one other thru hiker besides us is here, the rest are section hikers, including 7 young adults “supervising” a Mom and Dad on their annual anniversary section hike.  It’s a lot of fun getting to know an entire new group of hikers, and because section hikers haven’t formed family type relationships, they are quick to engage in conversation.

We woke up this morning to a damp but not soaked trail. The rain came as predicted, so staying in the shelter was a good call, but it wasn’t the gully washer predicted.  We got hiking by 7am and what we experienced all day long was a walking American History tour along the trail. The AT follows the path of numerous civil war battles that took place. Markers and monuments and placards shared the story of America’s civil war.  We came to George A Townsend’s (Gath as he was called) home which is now Gathland State Park. Gath was a journalist that reported on the assassination of President Lincoln, and wrote a book on his killer. He made and lost a fortune and the last sentence of the sign I took a picture of tells the whole story.
We walked through Washington Monument State Park, which features the very first monument to honor our first President and father of our country.  Walking up to the monument was a timeline of his life.  He faced many setbacks in life but always persevered.
We ate lunch in a campground just for backpackers!  Tent sites and picnic tables and showers!  Curly took one and came out all smiles.
With 7 miles left in our day, we headed out and enjoyed the most favorable terrain of this hike. It was as flat for most of the day as anything we have walked in for 79 days. I know we shouldn’t get used to it, but Maryland has spoiled us.  So we come to the end of this day and we are sitting on the edge of Annapolis Rocks, surveying the western views of  Maryland’s farm lands...it is gorgeous and with sunset approaching, we are truly blessed to have this glorious, serene moment.
Tomorrow is our final day in Maryland and at the end of the day (16.5 miles), we will be in Pennsylvania and whisked off to Burgundy Lane Bed and Breakfast to enjoy  a night in a jacuzzi and resupply in town...now that’s a great way to get the stink off!","Ed Garvey Shelter

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595776,"We awoke this morning to a gorgeous day and the excitement of getting into town. With16 miles and an early start, we made the most of the morning cool. Summer is definitely here, and afternoons are warming up. We will be facing some extra hot days going forward, so taking advantage of the early mornings will be important to our well being.  By 11am, we had hiked 8 miles, so a short break and eating the remainder of our food set us up for what we hoped would be an early afternoon arrival to our destination.
What we didn’t expect was the newest obstacle - rocks!  Not gravel or river rocks, but miles of large pointy rocks that cover the trail and not only do you have to hike on and around them, but following the trail becomes more difficult.  This is where the white blazes painted on trees and rocks become so important.  We began the day with rocks at the top of the mountains and finished the final 3 miles of descent with rocks. And thus begins what will be the norm for the next couple hundred miles.
Pennsylvania is referred to as “Rocksylvania”, and we have been anticipating this for a while.  The terrain is mostly flat except got hiking out of gaps, but the rocks make up for that. Like I’ve said before, there is nothing “easy” about this trail!  We finally arrived at Pen-Mar Park, which is at the state line and Miss Margaret who owns the Burgundy Lane B&B picked us up and took us to her lovely home.  Margaret has run this B&B since 2004 and is exceptionally busy. Averaging more than 80 hikers per year plus the regular clientele, she really knows what hikers need and is very accommodating.  We arrived, showered then walked down the Main Street of town (which is where the B&B is conveniently located) to Waynesburgers, a 5 Guys type burger joint with 51 different shake flavors.  Curly had raspberry and I had a strawberry along with burgers, fries and rice pudding.  Margaret shuttled is to a local store for resupply and we came back to soak in a huge jacuzzi. Yeah I know, doesn’t appear like we are suffering too much, but I suspect that will be changing soon.
With all our chores done, we are enjoying a cool, comfortable room and looking forward to a full on breakfast in the morning. Then back to the woods where we will make a beeline for Pine Grove Furnace State Park and the half gallon challenge. We will go over the 1100 mile mark on Sunday as well, so the miles and states continue to rack up.  It’s hard to believe that we will be in a position where the miles we have left to hike are less than the miles we have hiked already.  Even with 80 days under our belts, it’s hard to believe that that this adventure will be over sooner rather than later.","Annapolis Rocks

As usual, Curly got the royal treatment and home made, gluten free pancakes.  I would highly, highly recommend Burgundy Lane B&B whether you’re hiking the trail or just visiting the historical places in the area.  Margaret is exceptionally accommodating and bends over backwards for the folks staying there.  Food is great, rooms are wonderful and it is right in the heart of Waynesboro. It is probably our favorite stop on the trail so far.
With full belly’s and packs, we hit the trail at 930am, with a goal of getting in 15 miles. Summer has definitely arrived here in Pennsylvania, but fortunately the rocks have not, at least not to the degree that we are expecting. Entering the Keystone State was a pleasure and outside of our last climb of the day, relatively easy. We took one long lunch break at Old Forge Park and enjoyed a picnic table under the shade of large trees. It was a quiet day insomuch as we saw only a few hikers, but the congestion of suburbia is never far away, with the sounds of lawnmowers, revving engines, and weed whackers ever present and ever running.
With the heat, we slowed down a bit in the afternoon but reached Rocky Mountain Shelter at 530pm, about as good a time to stop for the day as any.   Pitched our tent under some pine trees and ate dinner with Wizard, a thru hiker from last year who is a ridge runner with the PATC and spends five days a week from April to September staying at different shelters along a 40 mile stretch of trail.  Nice guy and was very knowledgeable about the trail and all that is happening behind the scenes to keep the AT as pristine as possible.

Today however, all symbolism and ice cream aside, Curly and I literally reached the half way point to Katahdin!  The total distance this year is 2,190.9 miles. I had Curly take a pic of my phone that showed our distance hiked to date at 1095.5, just a smidge over half!  So what does this mean for us?
Not much really.  We still have 1095 more miles to go.  The good news is that all miles from here on mean less miles to hike than when we started. All miles left to hike are less than those already hiked.  What I suppose it really means is that we have a lot of work ahead of us, so keeping our eyes on Katahdin, but continuing to do so one leg of the journey at a time is more important than ever.  To that end, we are hiking to the State Park tomorrow, then on to Boiling Springs, where we will probably take care of town chores.  Tomorrow first thing on the trail we will cross the 1,100 miles hiked, that was something we were going to do today but decided against it.  Saving it for the morning!","Rocky Mountain Shelter

And...to just seal the deal, Curly was magnificent in eating an ENTIRE half gallon of ice cream this morning, which is a tradition of “not so wise” thru hikers at the half way point.  Naturally, it all caught up to her about 2 hours after consumption, and we could not hike if we wanted to.
So we will stay the night here at the hostel with 4 miles hiked today. Ugh!  This is what hiker family member Sparky calls a “diversionary tactic”.  Anytime something takes place which keeps you from hiking...good, bad, or otherwise.  Eating that much dairy certainly qualifies as a DT...as does Hostel’s refusing to answer phones or be available to hand over trail shoes.  Upside to all this is that we swam in the lake, took a hot shower and now are under a shady tree while I journal and Curly naps fitfully. Oh yeah, we are also VERY close to a bathroom!!
So today we hike short miles, then hit the trail hard and try to put some distance under our feet as we hike thru Pennsylvania.  
Postscript to this day.  Turns out the shoes were NOT delivered to the hostel, but to our home in SC!  Something got lost in translation, but fortunately the huge corporate entity that made the mistake is making it right by delivering shoes in Duncannon which is a Thursday arrival for us. 3 more days in worn out shoes and a Trail day “lost”...I mean diverted!  Curly says I’m being forced to live up to my trail name!","Toms Run Shelter

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596140,"So we got out the door and were hiking by 645am.  We are going to shoot for earlier departures as long as this heat keeps up.  Today we got 8 miles in by 1030am and stopped at the Green Mountain General Store for an early lunch.  Curly got a chef salad and I got a club sandwich and milk shake.  It ain’t cheap eating like this but it sure is fun.  Our ultimate destination was the Backpacker Campsite just outside of Boiling Springs and a 19 mile day. Problem was no water there so you have to hump it in yourself at the last water stop 4 miles away!  With the heat bearing down, I decided we would stop at the water source and camp there, then skip into town early tomorrow.  Great decision.  We arrived at our campsite at 330pm which made Curly ecstatic. We did get 15.2 miles in which didn’t make me ecstatic, but we can get them back tomorrow.  It was nice to jump in the river and cool off.  Even in the shade of this green tunnel, the heat index was over a hundred, which is pretty crazy for this neck of the woods.  It’s 7pm and just now beginning to cool down a little.  I have a wet hankie from the stream on my forehead and just shorts on.  Hears to hoping for a cool evening.
We did get a taste for the Pennsylvania rocks today on a couple of climbs.  Once we get past Duncannon on Thursday, they really come out in full force.  I was waylaid this afternoon by a 4 foot rat snake...scared the living daylights out of me!  I was walking the trail heading over some rocks and I nearly stepped on him.  I yelled out “Ka Ka” (the English version) and jumped backwards.  He coiled up and faced me like he was going to strike so I backed up further and waited on Curly to show up.  This dog gone snake started slithering up the trail, with no intention of leaving it.  We tried to run by but he coiled up again so even though he was not poisonous, I figured we needed to give him wide berth...we bushwhacked around him.  Needless to say, it got the adrenaline going.
Tomorrow morning we walk through Boiling Springs and into Cumberland Valley Farm Land. Unless the town has some type of celebration going on that’s worth sticking around for, we will make tracks for Duncannon, where our shoes will be...and that’s a good thing cause our dogs are barking!  Either way, may you all have a spectacular Fourth of July!","Pine Grove Furnace State Park

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596249,"Curly and I went to sleep last nite fully aware that today would be a big day.  We decided to get up even earlier than normal and attempt to get on the trail before 630am.  These morning miles are really important when the sun bears down in the afternoon.  So that’s what we did.  Up at 530am and on trail by 625am, we tried to beat the heat into Boiling Springs, PA.  We arrived in town right at 830am and the town was in full swing preparing for its Fourth of July Celebrations. Streets were being closed off and food vendors were setting up for a grand day.  We headed over to Cafe 101 for breakfast and both ordered the skillet special. It was delicious, along with several cups of coffee.  We debated hanging around for the festivities, but with 14 more miles to hike, much of it in open farm land, we knew we really couldn’t linger, so off we went.  
I have to say, I’ve enjoyed Pennsylvania very much up to this point. Along with Maryland, they really do an amazing job of creating an interesting and informative trail. Plus so much of the trail has gone thru state parks that are wonderfully maintained, it’s really a treat.  This afternoon however, we hiked thru farm land.  Miles and miles  of homesteads growing corn and wheat and soy.  It was incredible, but with no cloud cover, it was incredibly hot!  Fortunately, two things made it bearable.  The first was trail magic. Right about noon, we came to a road crossing with a cooler full of cokes, fresca’s, and ice tea. Golly that was so good, and came exactly at the right time.  The second thing was that we put our umbrellas to use to today, and not for the rain, but for the sun! The other hikers were jealous cause we were beating the heat, and we avoided sunburn and heat exhaustion.
The day itself was essentially one road walk, except we were walking through fields rather than black top.  About 3pm, with just a couple miles left in the day, the rain clouds moved in and thunder began sounding off.  Curly and I sprinted to the shelter and beat the rain, which actually held off til about 7pm.  We opted to stay in the shelter tonite with one other person, “View Finder”.  A mom and her three teenage daughters are section hiking north as well and are in their tents tonite.  They are a sweet family we met at Pine Grove Furnace a couple days ago.  Tomorrow we head into Duncannon to hopefully pick up shoes, eat a burger and milkshake, and resupply for the next several days. I’m hoping we can stay out in the woods for at least 5 days before coming in for our next resupply.  Right now it’s raining, but we are comfortable and dry!  Happy Independence Day, hope you all had a great one!","Tent Site mm 1118.7

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596362,"When we arrived in town, we were parched and ready for a short break, so we stopped at a quickie mart gas station for a drink and some A/C.  When we came out to get our packs, Lisa asked us if we needed to do any shopping at the grocery store? She was willing to take us there and bring us back. Oh yes please, and thank you very much! We jumped into her vehicle and she ran us to the store where we got enough food to take us to our next stop, thank you so much Lisa!
Afterwards we walked to the one and only Doyle Hotel. I was so excited, this is one place I really wanted to stop at and at least get some food. Sadly, no food was available but our shoes did arrive, yay!! So we ate at a pizza place that served gluten free crust and packed out half of it for dinner tonite.  We went back to the Doyle and had a beer and cider then on our way out stopped at an ice cream joint just to top off our stomachs.
Finally, after 3 plus hours of avoiding the trail and the heat, we strapped on our packs and slogged thru town headed for the hills.  Our last 4.7 miles were absolutely brutal.  The heat just saps you of your strength, and we got a taste of the rocks to come. I suspect that our mileage may go down just a tad over the next couple of weeks...at least thru Pennsylvania and the first part of New Jersey.
We made it to the shelter just after 6pm and expecting rain, are in the shelter again this evening. Our teeth are brushed, food is put away, and we are hoping that tomorrow the heat relents just a bit.","Darlington Shelter

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596455,"We woke up to overcast skies and continued threat of rain for the morning. That was ok though because the trade off, at least in the morning was cooler temps. We were on the trail at 7am loving the weather!  We knocked out the first 7.5 miles by 1030 and stopped at a shelter for a snack and break. The rain was off and on all throughout the morning, but it was more of a pleasant, cooling drip than an annoying and never ending type of rain. It actually felt quite nice, but by noon it was over and the heat returned, although not like it had been the past few days.
Our pace slowed with the heat but fortunately, we had awesome terrain with very little elevation gain, and the horrible rocks we have heard so much about have not made their appearance yet. The result is that we decided that rather than doing 20 miles today, we would grind it out tomorrow, and enjoy a very special campsite that we are now pitched in.
We had to camel in all of our water for tonite and tomorrow morning, about 4 liters, but it is more than worth it.  We are on top of a mountain underneath a stand of pine trees. Our ten is pitched under the trees and we have pine needles for our bedding.  The cool wind is blowing from the east and all bugs have been blown away with it.  Somebody took the time to make chairs out of the large stones, and we ate our dinner sitting on them.  As I type this out, we are in our tent and the flaps are open, which means that not only are we getting the awesome breeze but the sun is setting on Curly’s side of the tent...she is out like a light!
I think today was one of our best days on the trail, just because of the little gifts that the Lord blessed us with...cool breezes and pine needles!  We are going to make up the miles from today by hiking longer tomorrow. We want to get to the “Rock and Sole Hostel” on Sunday, and get there early enough to get our chores done and have a little down time. It means hiking 20-22 miles tomorrow.  If the terrain is as nice as today, it will be a long day but it is doable. We shall see!","Clark’s Ferry Shelter

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596565,"Last night was one of the best sleeping nights on trail.  Temps were down so far I had to get into my sleeping quilt rather than lay in top of it.  Amazing breeze passing through the vestibules all night long. It was an amazing night...until around 3am when I was awakened by a noise unlike anything I’ve ever heard before. It was a cross between a cry and a howl, and it was in a low pitch that was very eerie. It was right outside our tent and continued sporadically for about 30 minutes.  I knew it was an animal of some type, and had read that there was a porcupine that frequented this camp.  Later in this day I “googled” what a porcupine sounds like and sure enough, it matched what I heard with the exception of intensity.  I just hope what I heard was pleasure and not pain because it sure sounded like pain!
Speaking of pain, we needed to hike over 21 miles today in order to enjoy the pleasure of Sunday’s Hostel visit.  Curly isn’t a fan of twenty plus mile days, but if we don’t, then Sunday becomes a long day and keeps us from relaxing more.  No pain, no gain.  Fortunately, we only had a couple of big ascents the entire day, and the rocks are getting worse, but they are still tolerable, so getting big miles wasn’t that difficult.  And the weather was absolutely perfect, with the humidity finally backing down.  Even the locals were talking about this weeks heat and how unbearable it has been.
We came out of the woods at 130pm and much to our delight-trail magic!  Two young married thru hikers from last year, “Checklist” and “Trail Name” had their parents out with them and they were feeding hikers awesome food.  Burgers, dogs, fruit, cold soda and Gatorade...it was a great way to get up that mountain at the tail end of this day.  We filled up, said thanks, and got on our way.  The rest of the afternoon was spent hiking to our destination-William Penn Shelter, which sets us up for a short hike tomorrow to our pick up point.  Tomorrow we will also cross the 1200 mile marker!  Hard to believe we are under the 1000 miles to hike mark!","Tentsite mm 1169.3

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596659,"We woke up to another gorgeous day and looking forward to two big events: the first was cracking the 1200 mile mark, which happened late in the morning.  It’s really hard to conceive that we have less than a thousand miles to hike before this adventure is over. That’s not something I want to think about, but as the miles tick downward, it’s hard not to. Up to this point in the hike, both Curly and I have spent much of our time just figuring this thing called thru hiking out.  I won’t say we have mastered it, but the conversations of returning home are beginning to take place.  Crazy!
The second event was that we hiked a short day in order to stay at the “Rock n Sole” hostel, and we are so glad that we did.  We were due for showers and laundry, but more important, ready for some rest. We put in plenty of miles this week and our feet needed the break.  The rocks of Pennsylvania are beginning to take their toll, and with 90 more miles before New Jersey, they will only get worse.  For that reason alone this stop is worth it.
But this hostel is the real deal.  Craig and Jody, the proprietors of this hostel, are incredible people that run an awesome hiker home. It’s probably the cleanest place we have been in, excepting Quarterway Inn, and the food is right up their at the top.  Their price includes dinner and breakfast, and we ate like kings tonite!  In addition, they have a retro camper named “Trashy” that Curly and I are sleeping in tonite.  It’s a 1958 tin can type camper as cute as bug.  All this to say that we are having a great time and will be ready for the next leg of this journey, which will get us to the PA/NJ border by Saturday morning.
Tomorrow morning we will enjoy a home cooked breakfast, then sling our heavy packs and back on the trail.  Our next town stop will be Saturday in Delaware Water Gap.  As much as I enjoy Pennsylvania, I’m looking even more forward to putting these rocks behind me as we continue our trek north.","William Penn Shelter

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596726,"I’m glad we didn’t stick around, even though it was tempting.  Today’s weather was absolutely glorious with sunshine and 80 degrees.  Our terrain is getting progressively rockier, but the grade is pretty flat, with only one steep ascent today.  Plus we only had 14.5 miles planned, so with breaks we still ended up arriving in Port Clinton right around 5pm.  There is a church in town that has a large pavilion and green space and they allow hikers to tent there for free.  It’s on the river ( water can’t be consumed), and a highway is on the other side, so earplugs will be mandatory but it’s cozy and there are a half dozen other thru hikers here, so all is well.
Tomorrow the plan is to hike 15 miles to a shelter. I would like to do bigger miles, but the rocks make it difficult to plan larger days.  The other consideration is water, or lack thereof. There just aren’t many water sources over the next 80 miles, leading right into New Jersey, and the rocks limit camping sites. We will need to focus on shelters through the rest of PA, which means our miles will be a little inconsistent.  Tomorrow we climb out of Port Clinton first thing in the morning and then on to more rocks!!","PA State Route 183

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596821,"We started our day with a home cooked breakfast from the 3 C’s Restaurant.   They are only open for breakfast and lunch, and don’t like dirty, smelly hikers.  Since we just had showers the day before, we took a chance and we passed the “sniff test” from their resident Flo.  We poured on the southern charm and she told me to quit calling her ma’am. The coffee was hot, the eggs and pancakes delicious, and Curly got to eat out for her favorite meal.
Afterwards, she then did something she has never done before...she “slackpacked” today for the first time. Slackpacking is when you hike all day without your backpack; you just take water and snacks. Someone delivers your pack to the location you will be stopping at for the night.  We met Tom Kennedy last nite, he is co-founder of “Hike for Mental Health”, a non profit dedicated to helping people recover from mental health issues thru hiking. It’s a great organization and one worth getting to know better. Anyways, he was in Port Clinton and offered to slackpack thru hikers to Eckville Shelter for one dollar...just to cover his gas!  Curly took him up on it and she had an amazing day. She said she felt light and fluffy without that 20 plus pound pack.  The net result for us is that we made great time to the shelter, leading to the third reason this was Curly’s day.
We got to camp early!  By 415pm we were in camp at the shelter. This is always a desire for Curly just because it is down time. This shelter had a shower (cold) which Curly took. She got in a cat nap. And she got some great conversation time with other hikers.  All very good things for Curly!
In the end, we hiked 15.4 miles and enjoyed a beautiful day, taking in amazing views of the Pennsylvania Dutch countryside.  Tomorrow the fun will be severely dialed back as we finally face down the rocks everyone talks about.  The mileage goes up to over 17 as well, so we need to get an early start on the day. Weather is supposed to be cooler and clear which is a good thing.  And if you were wondering...no, I did not slackpack, I’m not ready to do it quite yet!","Port Clinton, PA

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596903,"Well, the day we have all waited for with fear and intrepidation finally arrived.  We knew it would be soon, and when it arrived, there was nothing we could do about it except push through.  That moment? Our official introduction to the Rocks of Pennsylvania.  Now mind you, it’s not like we haven’t experienced hiking over rocks during this trip. It’s just the fact that Pennsylvania is known for their rocks.  And the rocks we hiked over and around today were no joke.
With 17.5 miles to hike today, we got an early start and were on trail by 645am.  The first 7 miles were fairly tame, although there were indications that we may be coming into some new terrain soon.  After a short lunch, we got back on trail after crossing PA Route 309, it all changed.  The rocks got big...way bigger than anything we had seen up to know. Big boulders stacked on top of each other. The white blazes led us over, around and under rocks of all shapes and sizes, most of which were way bigger than us.
It requires great focus to navigate these boulder fields. So much focus that you are drained mentally once you get out. And the blazes require you to do a fair amount of scrambling. Both Curly and I found ourselves ditching our sticks at times so we could use our hands to grab hold of crevices.  Or we ended up sliding down huge stone slabs on our rears to get down to a new level.  What topped everything however was our next to last mile of the day.  We had climbed up and over these boulders only to find ourselves on a knife edge. I’ve talked about this before, and it is essentially a razor edge walking area where falling to your left or your right leaves you tumbling over a mountain ridge.  The knife edge we had to traverse was not only crazy dangerous like just described, but it was all rocks...rocks that required getting down from.  Curly hates dangerous settings, and she hates heights.  This was both in spades and there was no backing down.  So we took it one step at a time. A slooooow step at a time.  It was a long journey off that edge, and it shook her up pretty good.  But Curly is a trooper and she got through that challenge with flying colors.  What was really cool was that when we got to the next road crossing, all of our thru hiker buddies were sitting around drinking ice cold Cokes, compliments of Sparky!  We haven’t seen him since before Fathers Day a month ago.  Running into him was sweet, and being that he is from this parts, he got a friend to bring up some cold drinks for all his buds!  Thanks Sparky, you’re the best.
We finished our drinks and with a burst of caffeine energy, wrapped up our day by hiking the last mile to Bake Oven Knob Shelter, where we actually are just a tad past on the trail.  Bumblebee found a great tent spot, and temps tonite are for a high of 60 degrees.  Gonna be a great sleeping night, which we need cause tomorrow is another big day for us.","Eckville Shelter

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596981,"We got a super early start because we wanted to beat the heat and sun since that part of the trail is exposed. Also, as I mentioned previously, Curly is not a fan of heights and she had been spending way too much time dreading this day...the sooner we got it over, the better. Plus, there was motivation for Curly to conquer this mountain.  We discovered the previous night that there was a ski resort just off trail about 13 miles into our hike, just past Lehigh Gap.  They served hot food and ice cold drinks and that always appeals to Curly!  That would be our reward after!
So we got an early start and hit the Gap right at 11am.  From the start we knew it would be difficult. Straight up the mountain without switch backs and lots of large rocks, but not too treacherous the first half hour.  Then it got ugly. The trail led out into exposed areas with only rocks to grab on to. Hiking Sticks were not much help at this point. You had to hug the rocks and lean in towards the mountain because our back packs wanted to pull us backwards. The higher we went, the scarier it got, and the more it affected Curly.  We came to a place where we had to grab a rock with one hand and lean forward with one leg pushing up. It felt like if you didn’t actually get up to the next level, you would fall backwards down the mountain. I don’t think anyone has ever died up there, but it was a meltdown moment for Curly, and I hated to see her go through it. She struggled with her breathing for a moment then gained her composure and proceeded to kick that mountain’s butt!  I was super proud of her and we were able to get over the mountain in short order.  We hiked another mile or so through boulders and then the trail, I’m sure as if to apologize for putting us through such torture, attempted to make up by giving us a couple miles of soft, green grass to hike through.
Once we hiked through the next several miles, we got off trail and took a dirt road to the local ski resort, which is open year round and loves hikers. I told Curly she could have anything on the menu as a reward and she (we) had a delicious steak with plantains and asparagus!  Sure beats dehydrated potatoes with crushed Doritos!  We ate with several hiker buds that had likewise been traumatized by the mountain and ended up spending 3 hours at the restaurant!  
It was hard to break away but we still had miles to do, so off we went back on trail for a couple more hours and 4 more miles.  We ended up stopping at a tent site that sets us up for another 17-18 miles tomorrow and a short day Saturday into Delaware Water Gap.  Only a couple more days and we will be in New Jersey!!","Bake Oven Knob Shelter

We spent the rest of our day hiking 9.5 miles with the intention of staying at the shelter.  With a half mile left for the day, we came to a road crossing and Mrs. Santiago, the wife of Santiago was there with trail magic!  We have been hiking with Santiago off and on for the past two weeks and it turns out that she drove out to spend the weekend with him and they planned on cold drinks, chairs and chips for his hiking buddies.  Once again we experienced the generosity and power of relationships on this trail. It was really kind of them to treat us all so well and it was a blast hanging out with other hikers and enjoying cold drinks after a long day of hiking.  Puff Puff, a British hiker, told me about a grassy area just past the shelter with amazing views and the perfect place for a sunrise.  We hiked there and sure enough, it really is amazing! I placed the tent so that the sun will rise directly in front of Curlys vestibule, and there must be a dozen hikers pitched here.

What he was doing was ingesting something. He was eating!  Good for me because I might have have been struck had he not had a mouthful already.  I leaned in to see what he had eaten since a portion was outside his mouth.  They were the rattles of another Rattle Snake!

Curly would probably it was “eclectic”.  However this day is described, one thing is really clear to both of us: New Jersey is absolutely NOT the unfair stereotype it usually gets.  It is really a cool, diverse state, especially with respect to the outdoors.  Today was our last full day hiking in this state.  Tomorrow we enter New York and say goodbye to Jersey. During today’s hike, here are some of the places we walked...
We hiked through hay fields We hiked through bogsWe hiked through a National Wildlife PreserveWe hiked a road walk through neighborhoodsWe hiked through a cow pastureAnd yes, we hiked through forests as well!
It was really cool to spend our last full day in this state experiencing so much diversity in their natural resources.  Also, the rocks have lightened considerably and the feet truly appreciate it.  Towards the end of the day, our goal was to get to Heaven Hill Farms for ice cream.  The AWOL guide said it closed at 7pm, so we hustled to get there before they closed.  We arrived at 620pm only to discover they close at 6pm! Ugh...no ice cream.  But Tree Hugger asked the owner if we could at least buy a drink and he let all of us in, which was very kind.  We then found out that we were allowed to camp on the property for free, which was awesome since our original plan didn’t work out and we had no plan B.

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597682,"We said goodbye to New Jersey this morning and hello to New York.  Jersey gave us lots of great views and an extremely diverse trail.  After one day in New York, all we seemed to have gotten was rock scrambles!  Yes there are some big views but also big rocks.  It was a good day but tiring one.  Perhaps most significant today was the milestone of today being our 100th day on the trail.  Just writing that down blows me away. So much has taken place that it’s hard to wrap our minds around it.  We have walked from Georgia to New York...a distance of 1,375 miles!  My feet feel like it too!  We have said hello and goodbye to many new friends, people we would not have gotten to meet any other way than on this trail. We have both faced down fears and have discovered that this business of hiking the AT is really hard.
Most important though is that we have seen the Lord take great care of us every step of the way, and His people have encouraged, ministered and prayed for us. It has been a glorious adventure.    Only 815 miles to go!
We celebrated this day by what else?  Eating!  We both had our own banana splits and I’m surprised we didn’t swallow the spoon as well...nothing left but the memories.  Tonite we are at Wildcat Shelter fighting off the skeeters.  Tomorrow a long day to another shelter and Saturday a well deserved town day in Fort Montgomery (and crossing the 1400 mile mark).  We are cruising along and appreciate all of you who follow us and comment as well.

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597825,"Without a doubt, today was most likely our most difficult day in the trail.  All dramatics aside, both of us were ready to go home. Quit. Fini. No mas.  Crazy thing is that it was a beautiful, sunny, not too hot day.  We also were the beneficiaries of trail magic.  So you are wondering, what’s the deal Flex? Why so grumpy?  It’s all about the ROCKS!
Everyone talks about Pennsylvania and New kJersey being so rough on the feet, and they are.  But the rock scrambles...the hand over hand, put away your hiking sticks climbing...the unrelenting “ups” on boulders that never seem to end...it truly got the best of both of us today.  Very, very hard day. Very, very foul mood (Flex).  Both of us were thinking without saying to each other...if this is the rest of the trail, we are in big trouble!
Our goal was 19 miles that would put us a short 10 from town tomorrow. We settled for a hard earned 17 plus and a 12 into town tomorrow.  I really did not expect to even get 17 today; the rock scrambles slowed us down to a crawl.  But we started hiking at 7am, and didn’t pitch our tent til 8pm!  Now some of that time was spent on breaks and some great trail magic at the end of the day...which really was the key to talking us off our ledge.
A group of folks that thru hiked in 1998 (20 year anniversary) are spending this entire weekend feeding hikers as they pass thru. We were some of the last of the day, but a burger, hot dog, and some Dr. Pepper got us back on track.  Thank you class of 1998...you rescued Curly and I today.
So now we are tucked into our tent on a hot evening, waiting for the night to cool things down.  Tomorrow we have 12 miles to town, and are hoping for easier but expecting harder.  That’s just life on the trail!","Wildcat Shelter

Nothing like a hot meal (burgers and brats) and a good night’s sleep (except for the 3am wake up call when a 30 foot tree “widow maker” crashes less than 10 feet from your tent!) to change your perspective on the previous day!  We woke up ready to tackle 12 miles right over Bear Mountain and into a motel room run by none other than the world famous “grandpa”. Actually he is only famous in the hiker world because he takes such great care of us hikers. So we got off by 645am and within the hour had run into Tree Hugger and Bumblebee.  The mountains were just as steep as the previous two days, but one thing was different...steps!  That’s right, there were rock steps on this portion of the trail, so no hand over hand scrambling...it was awesome.  Still difficult, but awesome and beautiful.  Matter of fact, trail crews were working on the trail this weekend, which gave us the chance to thank them for their hard work. We did register 1400 miles hiked on the AT today...the miles keep racking up.
The other thing about today was the tourists and Day hikers. Lots and lots of them. So many that they clogged up the trail as we came over the mountain. But boy did they ever smell good! Unlike us, who stank something furious.  When we reached the top of Bear Mountain, we grabbed a couple of Cokes and watched the tourists from a bench. We haven’t seen this much civilization since before the hike began, and it was crazy. This place is only 40 miles from New York City and lots of folks come out here to the “country”.  It was a show for sure.
We finally got off our duffs and hiked down to the town.  The trail goes right through a Trail Museum, which is a pretty sad exhibition of animals you would find in the woods. A Bear, some vultures, other critters locked up in cages for city folk to look at.  I couldn’t get out of there quick enough.  Finally out, we had grandpa pick us up and take us to his motel a couple miles away.
Did our usual chores, got clean, ate at a BBQ jointed and got ice cream at grandpa’s son’s shop.  Curly had ANOTHER banana split! We are much better in our heads today than yesterday.  Thankful to be in this hotel room as rains are coming tonite with forecast of up to 2 inches! Supposed to rain all week so we are preparing for the worst.  We are only 60 miles from Connecticut and 103 miles from Massachusetts.  We should be there within the week depending on weather and terrain.  We look forward to some terrain void of rocks...our understanding is that it won’t be long!!","Tentsite mm 1392.5

She likes chocolate M&M’s with mint or peanut butter or caramel.  She eats gummy bears also. If she finds gluten free cookies she will carry those as well.  Glutino products are her favorite.
Flex carries everything else.  We eat gluten free dinners which consists of instant mashed potatoes, rice, quinoa, or soup. We will mix in tuna or chicken or spam, although Curly is over all that processed meat (I’m not).  We also mix instant soup in our potatoes, and add chips, Fritos or Doritos for crunch.  In addition, we have found gluten free instant gravy (brown and turkey) which we love!  Great flavor that transforms boring instant food. 
We are both tired of tortillas and I’m over peanut butter sandwiches. Instead, I carry a brick of cheese and crackers which I’ll eat in the late morning or early afternoon. Cheese will actually last about 3 days before it turns to oil, so we just eat it quickly.  I eat Kind bars, Nature Valley bars, Clif bars, pretty much any kind of protein bars and in addition, will rotate Pop Tarts, Little Debbie snacks and Hostess Donuts (chocolate covered) depending on what’s available. I don’t eat anything for more than a week if I can help it, just so  that I won’t get sick of it.  I eat 2 bars for breakfast and a couple more throughout the day.  I will spread Nutella or peanut butter on bars to add some calories.  At night after dinner, I always eat a little chocolate to end the day.  In the morning I ALWAYS have one cup of instant coffee.  At night I might flavor my water with lemonade powder.  The one thing I try hard to do is not eat something to the point where I won’t even look at it.  That’s where rotating foods helps so much.
As you can see, there’s a lot of junk in our menu.  I’m not proud of it, but it keeps us alive (at least for now). We both look forward to resuming a healthy nutritional lifestyle once we return.","Ft Montgomery

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598185,"Today we did the unthinkable...we quit hiking “just because”.  We had 3 goals for the day.  First, to hike to RPH Shelter and break.  Second, to hike 5 more miles to Mountain Top Deli for our dinner.  Third, hike 4 more miles to the shelter.  We didn’t get past goal number 1!
Our morning was a tough morning because of the rain. We packed up a wet tent, and hiked in rain that was on and off all morning.  Both of us have really struggled with our mental and physical energy lately, and this day was the toughest of them all.  When we reached RPH Shelter about 1pm, there was an older gentleman sitting outside in the pavilion area, and as we took off our packs, the skies opened up and he said matter of fact, “you should stay here for the night.”  I smiled and reminded him it was only 1pm, then he said, “you do know you can order Chinese or pizza from here and it will be delivered, right?”  I could feel my will breaking.  Then Curly spoke up, “oooh Chinese!”  So...you can figure it what happens next - we quit (for the day).  
We did take naps; we did eat Chinese takeout; and we didn’t even feel too guilty about it.  But best of all, the gentleman at the shelter was none other than Ralph Ferussi, the namesake for the shelter we were staying at!  RPH Shelter stands for Ralph’s Peak Hikers, and he is an AT legend in these parts. He has hiked 4000 miles of the AT and has maintained this section of NY since the early 80’s.  I was in lofty company, so I had to stay.  Over the next hour, Ralph shared story after story of the trail and the small part he has played to make it so special.
Eventually, he had to leave and we said our goodbyes, and as he left, other wet hikers trickled in. We ended up with a shelter completely full as well as 8 or 10 tents. Everyone was ordering food and we all had a great day. I’m not one for doing such radical stuff like this, but this time I am glad I did!","Tentsite mm 1419.4

Pretty flat and nice trail, plus the rain held off for the afternoon. About 330pm we arrived at Nuclear Lake, this stunning lake with nothing but forest surrounding it.  And this perfect location for sitting in front of the lake, or dare I say it...jump in?  Squeaks was already there and in the water. I wanted to keep moving, only 3 miles to camp, and Curly was not so willing.  The sun was hot...we were sweating like crazy...my will once again was breaking.  Or could it be something else? Could I have been bitten by the Spontaneity Bug?  That evil critter that ruins all type A planners and organizers?  I don’t know, all I know is that I succumbed.  Packs hit the ground, so did clothes (mostly), and then the splash! It felt soooooo good. Refreshing, guilty pleasures like this will be distant memories soon enough.  We enjoyed the wet and the sun that dried us afterwards.
Once again, we pulled ourselves from the lake and completed our hike right around 530pm, quitting time.  Leftovers from the deli was for dinner and we made the Shelter our home along with Squeaks and Penguin and Robin Hood.  Falling asleep, I can’t help but wonder what tomorrow will bring?  I just hope I can stay on task!","RPH Shelter

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598277,"We woke up this morning ready for an 18 mile day to a campsite in Connecticut.  That plan was to hike to NY Rt. 22, stop at a store for fuel for cooking and a Coke, then onward.  The rain began the very moment we started hiking.  Lightly at first, then progressing to harder and more intense. Umbrellas came out, shoes got soaked, and we were looking at a very wet day.  Nothing we haven’t experienced before mind you, but wet nonetheless.  The terrain was easy if a bit slick, and we got to our first destination, a Garden Center that sells goodies to hikers, by 9am. Unfortunately, they didn’t open till 10am, so we sat in the gazebo plotting our next move. That’s when Squeaks calls the fabulous Karen, who just began a hostel this year, and within the half hour, our day of rain and pain was over!  She picked us up, took us to her amazing place and we got cleaned up.  Then we went to town, did our chores and have spent the rest of the day dry and relaxed.
Folks, I just don’t know what to make of this, it is so unlike me.  This spontaneity is truly unbecoming, but oh so fun.  Curly thinks it’s hilarious, and the young hikers are like, “yeah, this is how we roll.”  I’m just trying my best to get to Katahdin before it gets cold.  We will see.

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598358,"One item I failed to mention over the last several days is that I popped another crown! The tooth right next to the crown I lost in Virginia came off about a week ago, only this time I placed the crown in a small baggie rather than back in my mouth.  The plan was to see a dentist when we hit Massachusetts, thinking a family dentist that our relatives knew was a better option than me just googling one locally. Yeah, well, I was brushing my teeth this morning and was really disturbed at the discoloration of the “nub” the crown was attached to.  So, rather than wait another week, I googled and called a local dentist who will see me tomorrow morning.  Please disregard yesterday’s journal entry where I stated unequivocally, “ we are hitting the trail and back on track.”  Not so fast.
Tonite we are staying at the awesome hostel we were at last night, and to make me feel a little better, we did get dropped off this morning at yesterday’s pick up point and we hiked back to our hostel, which is just off the AT.  So we did get 10.8 miles in for our trouble, AND we crossed state lines from NY to CT! 9 states down, 5 to go. Rain continues intermittently, so I don’t feel too bad about staying dry another night.  We also were greeted by the great state of CT with trail magic. At the first road crossing, Magic Jack, Rambo, and Julia were serving breakfast sandwiches and fruit and cold drinks. A great “how do you do?” For us new to this state. Curly T and I are most grateful for all the generosity displayed towards us and other thru hikers.

I was a little bit apprehensive going in to the dentist, concerned that there might be more of a problem than simply gluing a crown back on.  Fortunately, the fix was simple, and Dr Mike took amazing care of me.  He was really a great guy, and if I lived in Kent, he would definitely be my dentist.  Thanks again Dr Mike for taking such great care of this thru hiker!
With the crown back on, so was the hike.  We got dropped at the trailhead just before noon and made our way down the trail.  Rain was looming and with a pretty serious rock scramble coming up, the decision was made to just make it to the first shelter, a little over 7 miles from where we started, and save the scramble for tomorrow morning. The first couple miles seemed to be all up, and these short days most definitely make you “soft”.  And then the bottom fell out and the skies opened up! Thunder, lightning and torrential rain came down as we continued to climb higher and higher.  I really hate feeling like we are chasing after thunder and lightning, and that is what it feels like when  you are climbing in this kind of weather. But you have no other options, there is nowhere to go but wherever the trail takes you...which by now is a river.  Finally, after about an hour, the rain let up and we were able to make time to the shelter.
Per our usual routine, we are in the shelter because more rain is coming.  Tonite it’s 85% precipitation with more thunder and lightning. It’s now a battle between us and the skeeters!
Tomorrow morning first up is St John’s Ledge, a rock scramble that is not very fun in bad weather. We are praying all that (bad weather) is behind us after tonite...the last thing we need first thing tomorrow is more stress caused by the treacherousness of the AT!","Bulls Bridge Rd

It was a classic summer time scenario. It became more and more humid as the day wore on, which definitely took its toll on the two of us. We had a horrible time moving in the afternoon, so much that we ended our day 2.5 miles short of our intended stop. Then of course the rain came as it has so faithfully done over the past week.  Seems like we can’t go a day without rain.  We just endure it, fortunately today’s rain was a short one and not too demoralizing.  It was simply a much longer day than we both expected...so dragging ourselves into camp at 645pm was about the way this day should have ended.
Tomorrow we will hike 8.1 miles to Falls Village and then be picked up by some new friends for a day of rest, laundry and chores.

I think the combination of physical fatigue, mental fatigue, and the constant wet, humid weather had me in a low spot. I actually felt like we couldn’t get this done.  And then the morning came, and I had no idea what was to be in store for us!
We woke up to clear skies and cool breezes. It felt like the New England summer morning I’d been looking so forward to, but haven’t experienced many of. We only had a little over 8 miles to hike before we would meet the Bartram‘s and have a rest day, so spirits were a little higher than the day before.  Out on trail by 7am, the miles ticked off as the trail treated us so well. Awesome views of the Housatonic River, the Connecticut portion of the AT was a pleasure on this morning. Just after 11am, we reached our pickup point and within minutes we were in the care of John and Ann Bartram, we really didn’t just how blessed we were at that moment.  They gave us the driving tour of the incredibly beautiful countryside, including the towns of Lakeville, Falls Village, and Salisbury.  An absolutely incredible stretch of Americana.  We chatted with them about the area and their lifelong part in these towns, as well as their close friendship with the Weaver’s, who had connected us to them. (As an aside, it’s impossible for me to describe how much Wade and Betsy Weaver mean to us. We’ve been friends with them since moving to Chapin 8 plus years ago, they were in our couples small group, and they are beloved by all who know them).  Anyways, we finally reached their remarkable home and when we pulled into the driveway, who was waiting outside for us? Yep, Wade and Betsy!  Turns out the Weavers and Bartrams had been scheming to meet up with us and we had no clue.  I actually burst into tears, a flood of emotions taking over.  This was exactly what my soul needed at this moment, and isn’t it incredible how our Heavenly Father not just meets our needs, but exceeds them at just the right time?  Once I stopped blubbering like a baby, the party began!
Showers and laundry and lots of delicious food followed, along with laughter and catching up on goings ons. We talked a lot about the trail and had one of the best rest days in almost 4 months.  John and Ann have amazing 1800’s farmhouse with outbuildings, all original to the property. We relaxed outside in the shade of huge trees and the breezes washed over us.  Once again all is right with the world.
These amazing hosts also read through this journal to get an idea of what we eat on trail, and bought us a full resupply for our next leg...for both Curly and I! We are once again full up on our bags for the southern Massachusetts portion of this hike.  After a belly stuffing dinner of steak and lots of veggies, carrot cake and ice cream, we waddled out to the fire pit and watched some hiker tv before calling it a night. 
Falling asleep so humbled and grateful for the love shown to us, I’m once again reminded that as awesome as journeys like this are, relationships are what really and truly count.

It really was a magnificent time!
We arrived noon, ate and by 115pm we’re saying our final goodbyes.  Back on trail, we had two mountains to climb today, first up was Mt Prospect which we got up and over with no problem, and then late in the afternoon was Bear Mountain.  Again, the hoopla concerning the descent was over sensationalized, and although it was super steep, the rocks were dry and we just took our time.  Like the entire day, it was just good to be out there. Curly and I are convinced that all the healthy nutritious food our friends fed us with truly gave us an energy boost.  We will remember that for future town visits.
For me, the highlight of the day though was after descending Bear Mountain and entering Sage’s Ravine. This “ravine” had a gorgeous stream flowing through it and the water cascaded over multiple little water falls and into these pools of still water that would have been great swimming holes if the day was right for that.  The rocks were pitch black and the water was clear, giving off this eerily beautiful, yet spooky look.  I was mesmerized by the water and if we had made enough miles up to that point, we would have made camp there.  But we pressed on.  Finally, about 630pm, we reached Laurel Ridge Campsite where we are now...oh yeah, and we are now in Massachusetts AND have crossed the 1500 mile mark!  All in all, a pretty  good day.  Now we are snuggled into our tent hoping for another dry, yet cool evening.","Salisbury, CT

I’d love to know where this hiking season rates among the wet ones, ‘cause we just keep getting soaked!  Today kicked off what is supposed to be four more consecutive days of rain. Ugh, I know the land needs it, but it really dampens people’s spirits.  I’ve spoken with more hikers on this trail who are discouraged by the constant rain.  I get it, it’s nuts.  We woke up wet because of dew this morning, packed up a wet tent. Hiked pretty much all day in the rain, with really heavy downpours in the afternoon.  Thankfully it all subsided about 4pm which allowed us time to pitch our tent, and wipe it out before the next band comes through. It’ll either make you laugh or make you cry, and either way it definitely tests your resolve to be out here.
The great news in this day is that we had an excellent hiking day in spite of the rain and we didn’t get any views to speak of, but our day was mostly spent in huge pine forests, which smell so good and feel great under your feet (even wet)!  We didn’t have any crazy, dangerous trail to hike thru, which is always nice, and we passed two ponds which continue to amaze me. These beautiful bodies of water in the middle of nowhere, and the only way you can get to them is by hiking to them. It’s like an AT hikers private body of water. Serene, shorelines of trees and boulders...these views really enhance what was otherwise a very dreary day.
One other note about today. We were shuttled to and from the trailhead by “papa joe”, a trail angel in this town who helps hikers get to wherever they need to go and doesn’t charge a dime.  He accepts donations but doesn’t ask for them. He is an amazing gentleman who I want to be like when I grow up!  Joe keeps cold soda and Gatorade in his vehicle for when he picks you up at the trailhead, and knows all about the history of Great Barrington.  It was a joy and privilege to meet Joe, and I hoe he is able to serve hikers for many years to come.

It’s the first time we got a can of soda in the north for only a dollar!  Nothing like an ice cold Pepsi on a warm day.
At that point, we were half way to our destination, Upper Goose Pond Cabin, and were stepping on the gas to get there.

Today, stopping at the “Cookie Lady’s” house was another.  I don’t even know her real name.  All I know is that for many, many years, she has been giving cookies to thru hikers that stop by her house, which is just off the trail.  Hikers have written about her for years, so we were not going to miss out on this chance if at all possible.  Curly T and I got there mid afternoon and as we were walking into her driveway, she was pulling out. I asked her if she was the Cookie Lady and she said yes, but didn’t have any cookies for us as she was heading out.  I was ok with that, but I did ask for a picture, which she graciously allowed (see pic).  I told her she is a legend and thanked her for her service to hikers.

Sadly, we were not quick enough because with an hour of hiking left in the day, all the bad weather you have been hearing about opened up on us.  The sky literally went black, and the forest was so dark all I could see was the white blazes in the trees to direct us. Thunder and lightning accompanied the rain, and we found ourselves hiking not in a trail but in a river.   It was crazy how spooky it was, but all we wanted was to be under roof and to get dry.
Finally the shelter appeared and we were soon under cover and out of our wet clothes.  A hot meal of mashed potatoes, salami, chicken soup and pretzels warmed our stomachs.  Tomorrow we only have 3 miles to the town of Dalton, where we have a motel room reserved,and hopefully a breakfast joint close by. We are excited to be dry, clean and full of town food!!","Upper Goose Pond Cabin

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599353,"Our decision to stay in the shelter last night rather than pitch a tent turned out to be a wise one. We stayed in the loft of the Kay Wood Shelter and we heard rain fall all night long.  We woke up to rain, and we hiked all the way into town while it rained.  You get how it all went down...it was raining!  And then, just as remarkably, the very moment we stepped out of the woods and into the town of Dalton, yep, you guessed it.  It stopped raining! But we just didn’t care about any of that because it was TOWN DAY!  And we were gonna get clean, our clothes were too, and we were going to feed our faces...and best of all, we would be spending the next two days with cousin Alyssa.  Yep, we were enjoying this day before it even got started.
As we entered Dalton, which the AT passed right through, both Curly T and I  fell in love with this quaint New England town. Charming little cape cod homes, rich green grass, white picket fences (yes, seriously), and all of them neatly lined up.  Then we passed Tom Levardi’s home, the one noted by hiker poles rather than a picket fence to mark the boundaries of his property. Tom has allowed hikers to tent in his back yard for at least as long as the cookie lady has been doling out her treats.  We can only hope that others will pick up their torches or take on some other act of hiker kindness before too long.
We reached the Shamrock Inn and checked ourselves in, ate an amazing breakfast at the Dalton Diner then came back and got cleaned up. Before long, Alyssa showed up and we have had the best day together. Shopping, food, resupply, more food, ice cream, and plans made for hiking tomorrow.  We are going to hike ten miles together north and when we hit Cheshire, get an Uber back to town, grab a bite to eat, then Alyssa will drop us back in Cheshire while she heads home. We will still have another 3.5 miles to hike, but Curly T will be slack packing in the morning so it’s all good.  We are excited to get this special time with Alyssa, and perhaps we will get some more with her as we head north.
Today has been a wonderful day with family, and as we continue north, are looking forward to more of the same as this grand adventure begins to wind down.  Next stop - Vermont and 1600 miles!","Kay Wood Shelter

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599439,"I really and truly thought I had seen just about everything on this trail over the past 116 days.  What I couldn’t fathom in any way was what I would see on day 117.
The day started wonderfully.  Waking up in a comfy motel bed...packing up and getting coffee and a lemon poppyseed muffin at the local coffee shop...the sun and blue skies in abundance...an easy road walk to start the day.  It was the perfect beginning to a perfect day, AND we had our cousin Alyssa with us which was so great. Alyssa loves the outdoors and is a strong hiker in her own right; she was so generous to us this weekend and the joy we had being with her was simply wonderful.
We get on our way, the three of us, and are having a great hike.  The plan is to hike 9.5 to Cheshire, then catch a shuttle back to the hotel where Alyssa’s car is, and bring Curly and I back (Curly was slack packing) to the trailhead where we would hike 3.5 more miles to the shelter.  We enjoyed a mid morning snack at a lovely pond along the way. The trail is muddy but navigable, and for once, sunny.  The miles tick off and then, with about2 miles to go in this portion of the day, we encounter a hiker.  A guy hiker.  A guy hiker traveling southbound. I am ahead of the girls and encounter him first.  And I can’t help but notice he is, shall we say, “scantily clad?”  Matter of fact, this rather large, sweaty man is hiking in boots and this leather thong of sorts, but not much else.  I’m talking his feet were covered but that’s about it.  Fortunately, his private parts were covered by something, but I was too shocked and trying not to stare. Making eye contact was difficult and he stopped to talk. I’m sure this was all for shock factor on his part and it worked! He did inform me that he wanted to thru hike the AT someday but wanted to do it “natural style” as he put it. I really wanted to make a joke about the skeeters having lots of opportunities but just mumbled “good luck”.  Curly and Alyssa did a much better job ignoring him than I did.  I think I was in shock.  Later in the day, I talked to a hiker who was behind me and said that when he saw him, he was completely naked. You really can’t make this stuff up!
Regaining my composure, we hiked the last two miles to our first destination and who is there providing trail magic!  Mrs One Foot! We were so excited to finally meet the one and only Cheryl.  It was so cool, and the fact that “one Foot” was in the area made it the best.  His family was at the trailhead to greet him upon his arrival and all the hikers that showed up got to be part of the party. It was so fun to meet his wife and Mom and brother and grandma.  Crazy stuff and proof again that the best aspects of this trail (just like life) are the relationships.  In addition, I got to see Sparky who we haven’t seen in several weeks; and Sunrise, a hiker from Japan that we met at the beginning of this hike and haven’t seen since mid May! What a day, what a reunion.
Then, One Foot invites Curly and I to spend the night at his family’s place which is just up the road, and tomorrow we will slack pack Curly 14 miles to Williamstown.  Another amazing gift in this extraordinary day.
Tonite instead of being in our tent in the woods, we are snuggled up in a comfy bed provided by wonderful and generous people.  I’m telling you it just keeps getting better out here!","Dalton MA

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599668,"So, we got up and out the door for a 14 mile hike from Cheshire to Williamstown with a lunch stop in top of Mt Greylock.  Curly slack packed one last day (for now), and I left all my food behind except snacks. We had a sunny and hot day in front of us, but no complaints...it beats rain!  The climb up Greylock took all morning as it was an 8 mile ascent!  Fortunately, it was a slow and gradual climb, which made it pretty easy. Of course Curly flew up those climbs!
We arrived at the top of Greylock at noon and a nice lunch was waiting for us. We ate in Bascom Lodge, which also has a bunkhouse for those wanting to stay overnight.  It was a cool place and made even cooler by the home made ice cream for sale.  A bit pricy but I got home made peppermint ice cream, which I haven’t had since I was a kid. Definitely took me back!
Six more miles awaited us, as well as a hot shower and pizza, so we got moving and the rest of the day was basically downhill.  Pretty easy grade and we were back at the house by 430pm.  We cleaned up, ate and got our packs ready for tomorrow.  We are definitely looking forward to tomorrow, even though it means saying goodbye to “One Foot’s” family.  It also means hiking into Vermont and crossing the 1600 mile mark!  Gonna be a great day!","Cheshire, MA

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599670,"Both Curly and I woke up this morning not wanting to move, let alone hike!  We both agreed that the nice, soft bed we just spent 2 nights in left us wanting to be home in our own bed. And there lies the problem with spending more than one night away from the tent.  It makes us soft!  And we’ve come too far to wuss out at this point...so, we sucked it up, said our farewells and hit the trail by 720am.
We knew two things right from the  git go...it was going to be a sweltering day and we were going to hike into Vermont, which means mud!  Both were absolutely spot on!  We crossed the MA/VT border about 930am, and celebrated completing our 11th state and entering our 12th.  I try not to think about the distance we have come from, but it’s hard not to when you consider that 119 days ago we were beginning this adventure in Georgia.  And all we have done is follow a white 2x6 blaze marked on trees pointing north.  It really is crazy and that became apparent to me this morning.
We had lunch after crossing the 1600 mile marker, and put ourselves on cruise control the rest of the day. Naturally, thunder started making noise about 2pm, and just before 4pm the skies opened up .  We holed up in a shelter until it blew over and we were back in trail by 5pm.  Our destination was still 4 miles away and there was no way we would get there without killing ourselves, so we found a great little campsite 2 miles short, giving us just a tad over 16 for the day. Set up camp, cleaned up, ate and now we are in bed with very heavy eyelids.  Tomorrow more rain is forecasted (big surprise) and we hope to do about 15 more miles...we shall see!","Williamstown, MA

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599916,"We stealth camped last night because we could not make it to our planned stop point.  It’s getting tougher now to get up and around at our usual times because it’s not light at 515am anymore.  I got out at 530am and we did our typical morning routine and did hit the trail by 7am.  The first two miles were a steep descent down huge rocks. I was so glad we didn’t attempt that at the end of the day yesterday!  Then as usual, it was a steep “up” and it seemed like that’s what we did all day.  It really beat us up good, especially Curly.  She had a rough day and I thought she did great all things considered, she kept pushing through and in the end, we got to where we needed to get. This hike is only going to get more challenging as we get closer to the end.  Finding ways to minimize that difficulty is something I need to figure out, especially for Curly’s sake.
After lunch and with 8 more miles to hike, we set out for Glastonbury Mountain.  It was the highest peak of the day, and I thought there were enough flat spots along the way to help us get our breath back.  But the final ascent up was a doozy! Straight up and about a half mile long!  Extremely taxing on the legs and lungs, but 2 cool things at the top.  Clear, ice cold mountain water from a stream by the shelter, and the fire tower at the top of the summit.
We then made a dash for the shelter about 4 miles away and of course the rain came in late afternoon. By the time we arrived at the shelter all the good tent spots were taken, so we put the packs back on and kept walking. 30 minutes later we came upon a “one tent” stealth site about 50 feet from a nice, gurgling spring. Fortunately the rain stopped just long enough for us to pitch our tent, eat dinner and jump in the sack. I think Curly crapped out the moment her head hit the pillow!  I’m not far behind...tomorrow it’s Stratton Mountain and one day closer to town!","Tent site mm 1609.5

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599917,"So that’s what today was all about.  Fortunately, we only had one big climb today, Stratton Mountain, and the terrain and grade was a bit more forgiving (except the mud).  We climbed up through magnificent stands of huge pine trees, every time a breeze came through the scent from those pines was like walking through a Christmas tree lot.  In the parts of the trail that were dry, your feet would crunch the pine needles and feel so soft on the pads of your feet.  It was a challenging climb, but not one as difficult as yesterday. We arrived at the top and it was 50 degrees with wind chill! For the first time probably since the Smokies in late April, we actually were chilled.
After a snack and a trip up to the top of the old fire tower (me, not Curly), we headed north for our final 3.5 miles to Stratton Pond Shelter. We arrived at 430pm and called it a day...our earliest finish in like forever!  Cleaned up, ate dinner and socialized with the folks here tonite. Really a lot of fun to hang out and chit chat when you’re not so exhausted like we normally are.  All in all a great day, and tomorrow only 10 miles to the road we hope to hitch a ride from into Manchester Center.","Tent site mm 1626.5

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600043,"That’s right...Town Day! Today we woke up with a meager ten plus miles between us and perishable food.  I’m telling you, if I didn’t get out of the way, Curly would’ve run me over.  She claims her pace was due to flat terrain; I say it’s because of the “town day” effect.  We were on trail by 645am and hit our road crossing at 1130am, honestly a record.  Just as we crossed the road and stuck out our thumbs, a trail angel pulled into the parking area and dropped off Tumbles and Will-in-Motion.  Apparently they told the driver we were not serial killers or panhandlers because he immediately opened his trunk and motioned for us to get in.  Five minutes later we were dropped off in the center of cute, tony, sophisticated and might I add, expensive Manchester Center, Vermont.  Very cool place, one where rich people and smelly hikers coexist in almost perfect harmony.
First up, big honking burritos with chips, salsa and limeade.  Then a big bowl of ice cream (coffee, maple walnut, and vanilla if you were wondering).  Then, Starbucks vanilla bean Frappuccino.  By the way, I weighed myself today after avoiding the scales for the past month and a half. I’ve actually gained back seven pounds (wonder how)!  Then, resupply at the local grocer. We bought 3 days of food plus dinner to cook for ourselves tonite.  Finally, pickup by Jeff who runs Green Mountain House Hostel.  What an amazing place.  Jeff has this hostel down pat.  Super nice, cleanest hostel on trail, tied with Quarterway Inn, and a well oiled machine. I am so glad to have had the opportunity to stay here, it’s a treat. And I failed to mention that with your stay, you get to buy one pint of Ben & Jerrys ice cream for a buck!  A buck people!  Anywhere else in America you know what a buck gets you? Nothing. Nada. Zip.  But here at this incredible hostel, a pint of ice cream. But I digress.
So we got to the hostel, cleaned up, did laundry, and Curly took a nap. I strategized for the rest of our time in Vermont, which I hope to be in New Hampshire in one week.  We shall see. Dinner was thick cut pork chops, sautéed spinach with mushrooms, cucumber/tomato salad, and gluten free toast.  Ice cream for dessert.  It was a great day and I’m thankful for days like this.  A chance to rest the body, socialize with hikers you might not see on the trail, and get calories in the body. Check, check and check.
Tomorrow morning it’s back to hiking and naturally the forecast is for rain (shocker).  But tonite, we are dry, clean, with full bellies and happy hearts.","Stratton Pond Shelter

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600305,"We rested well and woke up refreshed and ready for the day ahead, a day in which we acknowledged 4 months on the trail. It’s hard to conceive that we have been away from home this long, and as much as we miss and love the folks back home, we really are savoring these final weeks on the AT.
Dropped off at the trailhead, we headed north to climb the first of three mountains in this day.  We had a pretty easy hike up Bromley Mountain, which is also a ski resort. When we got to the summit, we discovered that the ski lift was running and they allowed thru hikers to ride it all the way down and back up for free!  Diversionary tactic number one for the day.  So we hopped on and enjoyed magnificent views of the surrounding countryside.  After an hour of goofing off, we got back on trail to hike over our second mountain, Styles Peak. It was a little tougher of a climb than previously, but we were rewarded once again with great views and a lunch break.  Diversionary tactic number two.
After lunch we still had 7.5 miles to go before the day was finished so we set out for our third climb, Baker Peak.  It was the most challenging climb because it was a fair amount of scaling rock faces.  Curly went right on up like a champ, and we got best views of the day! It was actually cold up on top, as the sun was hidden behind the clouds all day. We got moving not only to warm up, but to make our final push to Lost Pond Shelter. We got in about 530pm and have our tent pitched in front of the shelter. The water source is a large stream below us whose sound is very soothing tonite.  We are bundled up as the temps are headed into the low 50’s and rain is threatening.  It is not even 8pm and Curly is out like a light.

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600306,"Speaking of little things, we were on the trail for about an hour when a family of backpackers came towards us from the opposite direction.  Leading from the front were two little twin boys, couldn’t have been more than four years old. They were dressed in hiker gear to the nines.  Bandanas on both heads, hiking boots, backpacks, water bottles, it was incredible.  I said “good morning boys, you guys look ready to hike”, and the one out front said in a loud, enthusiastic voice, “This is so AWESOME!”  I was grinning from ear to ear, as was Curly!  The Dad had the family dog on a leash and he was clearly enjoying himself, as was Mom, who brought up the rear.  We both got a huge kick out of those boys.
Later in the afternoon, up top of White Rocks, we came across two Rock Gardens.  According to our guide, these gardens were built by magical woodland gnomes!  Not sure who actually built the garden, but they both were really cool.  Random rock cairns all over the place, and in such a remote location.  Again this is the kind of stuff nobody will ever see unless they thru hike.
Today’s hike all throughout the day was beautiful.  The scenery and terrain that is.  We hiked at mountaintop level through huge stands of pines.  We haven’t seen anything like it since Roan Mountain in Tennessee.  The Vermont mountains are lush and green, and we are finally back to seeing clear, cool delicious mountain water.  It’s about time.
We actually finished hiking just shy of 15 miles at 4pm, which never happens. We pitched our tent ate dinner and socialized with thru hikers Sunrise and Tuck.  Tomorrow we are going to hike over Killington Mountain,the second highest mountain in Vermont. Better than that, there is a ski lodge at the top that has a restaurant we are hoping will be open when we get there.  Curly is counting on real food for dinner tomorrow night, so we will need to hoof it.  We shall see!","Lost zooms Shelter

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600349,"Today was definitely a great day of hiking, but also a serious gut check for the remaining 490.9 miles that will come.  Yes, we finished our day smack dab on mike marker 1700! That was very cool.  We also passed the “500 miles to Katahdin “ sign earlier today, which was also cool.  We hiked 18.5 miles today, which was very cool, especially because we did it here I Vermont (although the motivation was food, as usual).  But in the midst of all the cool, we see that some change is definitely going to take place.
First, the terrain is getting more rugged and challenging.  We spent what seemed like the entire day going “up”.  I know that’s not totally correct, but it felt that way. We did hike up and out of Clarendon Gorge, and hiked over Killington Mountain all in one day. I’m very proud of Curly for her effort today, she really showed up big time.  The climbs are only getting bigger and more difficult.
Second, the weather is definitely changing. It feels like in the past two days that we went from summer to fall almost instantaneously.  I love this weather (except the rain); the temps are perfect for hiking and the skies are overcast which is awesome as well. But it’s definitely getting colder. Ugh.
Third, we are needing to get into town more often to look after our bodies. They are feeling the effects of 4 months of continuous hiking.  Three days max in on the trail and then a town day. We were doing 5-6 days at a time, but nutrition and rest are more important than ever as we close the gap on this hike.
Tomorrow we have a 4 mile nearo into Rutland, where we are staying at the Inn At Long Trail. It’s a favorite of ours with a great Irish pub that serves the best Irish stew! In addition, we get to meet with friends who live up here, once again enjoying the relationships that make this adventure so special.

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600620,"I mentioned in yesterday’s post that food motivates both Curly and I to go to great lengths so that we might enjoy good food.  Well, that certainly was the case yesterday when we hiked an extra 4.5 miles in order to be that much closer to breakfast today.  We had our earliest start ever on the trail by hiking at 615am this morning.  The goal was to hike 4 miles from Churchill Scott Shelter to Inn At Long Trail before 930am, which is when breakfast ends.  We made it there by 850am and proceeded to enjoy one of the best breakfasts we have had on the trail. Curly got an omelette with asparagus and Cabot cheese; I got blueberry pancakes with Vermont maple syrup.  It was incredible and as I recall, I might have licked the plate!
We then started laundry and aired out all of our gear that was soaked from the night of rain we had .  We couldn’t get into our room early, but kept busy until noon, when we met up with Marty and Julie Bascom.  Marty was Curly’s moms pastor here when she lived in Vermont, and really a surrogate son. He did a great job of looking after her while she was up here, and the entire family loved her like their own grandma.  Which we will always be grateful for.  They showed up and whisked us off to Rutland for lunch and resupply.  The afternoon was great!  We caught up on families, and church stuff, and just had a wonderful time reconnecting.  We took them to the Yellow Deli for lunch, again, one of those iconic AT places you just have to visit.  The food was excellent as was the company.  After saying our goodbyes, we finally got into our room, showered and napped, thus completing all of our town chores for the day.
Because we were staying at the Inn At Long Trail we had to eat in the pub.  Classic Irish cuisine that is top notch.  I had Irish Stew and Curly had Corned Beef n Cabbage.

A year ago, we section hiked this part of Vermont that we are in right now. Funny thing even though this is the second time we’ve hiked this section, we don’t remember all the “ups”!  Selective memory failed us today because we had an onslaught of ascents. All day long we were going up and it took its toll.  Fortunately the weather was nice all day and rain didn’t threaten until the very end.
The downside to a day like today is that we hiked way longer than we would have liked to.  We didn’t wrap up the day until 7pm, which is very unusual for us.  We did, however, outhiked bad weather to get to the Outpost with ten or so other hikers.  The Outpost is a private cottage whose owners allow us hikers to use it when they don’t need it.  It has a huge deck on the roof that scores great views for 360 degrees.

The weatherman was spot on and we enjoyed one of the nicest days on trail in recent memory.  Coupled with some incredible views and a bunch of fun walks through Meadows and open summits, this day was spectacular.  The ascents are still a bit rough in spots, but the view you earn for putting in the work is well worth it.
In addition to the day being so beautiful, we were able to stop at two neat places just off trail that turned out to be nice treats.  We stopped at “On The Edge” Farm and ate some donuts, watermelon and slugged down a quart of chocolate milk!  Then a few hours later we stopped at “the Back Porch”, which was actually a back porch of a couple who thru hiked the AT in 2016, got married and bought a farmhouse on the trail so that they could provide a little hangout place for hikers to take a break.  Although we didn’t get to meet them (Firefly and Loon), we did eat our lunch on the back porch and Curly chilled out in the hammock. It made for a great lunch...thanks much Firefly and Loon!
We needed to make some miles in order to have a fairly short hike into Hanover tomorrow, so we got going.  Over the course of this day, we climbed up and over 5 mountains/hills.  Lots of upward motion going on and as we got closer to the end of the day, I was dragging.  We loaded up on water at a shelter and at 430pm, needed to find a place to sleep that was closer to Hanover than the shelter.  Finally, at 630pm we crossed an old logging road and set up right there.  Tent pitched, dinner cooked and eaten, and bear bag hung.  This day is over and we are only 12 miles from a double zero!  All in all a pretty good day.","Outpost

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600696,"One of the things I really enjoyed about today was the road walking.  We had two extended road walks this morning and it’s always fun to hike something out of the ordinary.  The first road walk took us through the village of West Hartford, Vermont.  There isn’t much to the village, and walking through it didn’t take long, but what you see are classic New England homes and boarded up businesses that just couldn’t make a go of it. I thought that if only those businesses leaned towards thru hikers, would success, or at least survival, be a possibility? These establishments are actually on the trail, and most hikers won’t hesitate to spend money if the goods are stuff they really need and desire.
The second road walk was a longer one that spanned the trail from Norwich, Vermont to Hanover.  As soon as we came out of the woods and headed toward town, one of the first homes had two Adirondack chairs and a cooler out front. The cooler was filled with ice cold Cokes!  And the chairs were for sitting a spell.  It just so happens that as Curly and I were taking a load off, the owner of the house came outside and we got to meet him.  What an outstanding trail angel!  He has been doing this for eight years. He has never hiked the AT, but watched hikers go past his home for many years, and one day he decided to bless them. So every day during hiker season this is what he does, and I can assure you he definitely makes an impact! We thanked him and told him how much we appreciate his generosity and kindness. And what a difference this act of generosity makes.  It truly does. There is something special about cold Coke and the boost it gives. Maybe it’s the caffeine; maybe it’s the fizz, I don’t know. All I do know is that it is delicious and appreciated!
We finally got into New Hampshire by crossing the Connecticut River around 1230pm, took the required pics at the state line, then hustled over to Raimuntos for our free slice of pizza that all thru hikers get. Poor Curly is gluten free, so I relieved her of her slice and afterwards we were picked up by Curly’s sister Donna and her husband Dave.  They are taking us in for the weekend and we are excited to get a couple of days with them.  Not only will it be restful, but it will be fun to hang out with them.

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601003,"We hiked exactly zero miles over the weekend.  I’m not a fan of zeroes, but our bodies needed a couple of days of real rest before we make our final push to Katahdin.  So that is what we did. The only walking we did was to the fridge, the bedroom or the bathroom.  It was a good break, one we needed.
We were picked up in Hanover on Friday afternoon by Dave and Donna Lee. Donna is Curlys sister and Dave and I were best buds and served on the same ship in the navy.  They took amazing care of us! We are exceptionally well, they made sure we got our chores done, and they made us feel comfortable in their home.  I can’t begin to express how much we love and appreciate them both.
In addition to enjoying a very resting, relaxing weekend with family, our young Nephew Malachi (Donna’s grandson)was baptized and the church had a picnic on Saturday.  We had a lot of fun visiting with family, and celebrating this important moment in Malachi’s life.  Two of our favorite ladies, Auntie Carol and adopted Auntie Jean drove out for the day to see Malachi and us.  They came all the way from  Boston and we were grateful.  They are fun loving, wonderful women and once again I was strongly reminded about the importance of relationships. Even on the trail,we need each other, we were created to be in meaningful relationships, so these moments accentuate that truth!
The next day was Sunday, and we went to church that morning.  We both discovered how much we miss that part of our life!  Can’t wait to get home and resume our “normal” lives, which includes weekly worship.  Our packs are now packed, stuffed with 3 days food as we head out in morning for Glencliffe, NH and the beginning of the Whites. Only about 1 month left in this adventure, and I think we both can’t wait for this to end, but don’t want this to end.  I’m sure all that will work it’s way out very soon.","Hanover

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601093,"And that work began today when we were dropped off in Hanover around 9am.  The plan was to hike at least 14 miles given the late start, and we finished up the day at 13.8.  The day itself was beautiful, with clear skies and just enough sun to keep you perspiring.  It’s always hard to hike big miles after a couple days off, but we need to take advantage of good terrain while we have it.  Matter of fact, it was a fairly easy day of ups, and we got some great views from the peak of South Moose Mountain.  I am certain that the views today are nothing compared to the next few weeks, but it was nice to actually have dim views, something we haven’t really had in a while.
With Curly and I feeling the effects of two days off, we started looking for a stealth site around 530pm and shortly after, we were done for the day. Just a tad shy of our goal, but close enough.  Camp was set up, dinner was eaten, and now we are snug in our tent, with Curly already drifted off to sleep.  Tomorrow we are anticipating another nice day and we will gladly accept it!","Hanover

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601094,"We began the day hiking up and over Holts Ledge.  Not too bad, but we were glad it was early in the morning.  The big climb came afterwards when we hiked up and over Smarts Mountain.  The climb up was close to five miles long, and portions were so steep and rocky that I thought we were already in the Whites.  It is amazing to me that in spite of the fact that we have almost 1800 miles of this trail under our belt, we still eel like we are out of shape!  These mountains are difficult, no doubt about it.  We took our time, and eventually got up and over the mountain.nice part was that the four mile descent was very easy.  No boulders on that side of the mountain, just lots of mud. Matter of fact, I ended up having my entire right leg up past the knee in a mud hole. So much for brand new shoes!
With three miles left in the day, we made our way up the base of Mt Cube.  The shelter we are planning on staying at “Hexecuba Shelter “ was about halfway up. The good news is that we don’t have to hike that tomorrow. The bad news is that we still have a mile and a half of some serious boulder scrambling to the top in the morning.  In the rain.  Ugh.
We got to the shelter at 530pm and set up home in the shelter. Rain is forecasted for tonight and all day tomorrow. We need to make 14.5 over 3 mountains and into the Welcome Hikers Hostel at Glencliffe and that is in bad weather. Should make for an interesting post tomorrow!","Tent site mm 1762.5

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601257,"So into the rain we went and our first mountain of the day was Mt Cube.  It was a wet, rocky start to the day, and took us almost two hours to go 1.65 miles!  The rock slabs we were hiking over had no grip and being wet made it even more of a challenge. Fortunately our summit was a short distance and we were met in the other side with a much easier descent.  The rain continued and we were walking literally through a river not a trail, but we were thankful to not be on boulders.
Because it rained literally the entire day, we did not stop for breaks, but instead ate as we hiked.  Our second climb of the day was Ore Hill, but Curly was emphatic that it was a mountain and not a hill. Whatever it was, we started to claim back some time given the easier ascent, and by the time we had finished with that climb we were only 5 miles from our destination.  In front of us, Mt Mist.
Once again, and probably the last time in NH, we caught a break and going up was completely wooded! I was shocked and surprised, but the forgiving terrain enabled us to get up to the summit in under an hour. Wouldn’t you know, when we reached the top, the rain stopped, the sun came out, and there was actually mist rising up, just like the mountains namesake.  All that lasted about ten minutes, because as soon as I removed my rain jacket, the heavens opened up again, and for the next 2 hours we were drenched one more time.
We came out of the woods about 430pm and finally the skies cleared up...always happens when we are not hiking!  We went to the Welcome Hikers Hostel and got ourselves settled in for the night.  Town good, hot shower and tomorrow we are going to both slackpack southbound over Mt Moosilauke, the beginning of the White Mountains.  It is a safer hike to go south, and it is only 9.5 miles, so I’m hoping for a short day. I haven’t slackpacked yet and am looking forward to it.  Our cousin Alyssa is joining us which is exciting and should make for a fun day!  We know our mileage is going to be reduced going through the Whites, but we want to do this safely and enjoy it.  Tomorrow should be a great day!","Hexacuba Shelter 
",Welcome Hiker Hostel Glencliff NH,"Aug 22, Wed",14.60
Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601256,"On this day, we had only one goal in mind: to hike over Mt Moosilauke and begin our quest to take on the White Mountains.  We had spoken with a lot of folks about the best way to accomplish this feat, and one response kept appearing over and over...hike Moosilauke southbound rather than northbound.  The reason for this is that the northern trail coming down to Kinsman Notch is not only steep, but very dangerous, especially in poor weather.  It is easier (a relative term) and safer to go up rather than down the north side.  And if possible go with as little weight as possible.  So that’s what we did.
We made plans with the Hostel to drop us off 9.5 miles north and we would hike back to the Hostel and stay a second night.  We would also leave all of our gear there, except food, water and emergency gear.  It was the best decision we’ve made all trip.  The day itself was beautiful, so weather was not a negative factor.  Going south allayed the fears and anxiety that Curly was feeling, so that was a win. We had cousin Alyssa with us, who is a strong hiker and great hiking companion to have around.  And we had all day to hike 9.5 miles...a huge win for us.
As expected, the hike up was definitely more than we bargained for.  Extremely steep and rugged, the one thing I continued to press upon Curly was NOT to look down. These steep ups are easy when going up...they become extremely frightening when looking down. it took us almost 4 hours to hike 4 miles, a testament to the challenge of this mountain, but when we summitted  the views were our reward!  Million dollar views from all directions. We could see where we have come from as well as where we are headed.  The winds were bringing down temps so cold puffy jackets were put on!
We continued on and made much better time coming down the mountain, naturally the lure of dinner out inspired us all.  With the anticipation of a hot meal, we booked it and made the last 5.5 miles in just over 3 hours, getting us back to the Hostel by 430pm.  Showers and a night out on the town made for a perfect day.  Tomorrow we take on the Kinsman range and nice weather is expected through the weekend! Looking forward to the challenges ahead.","Welcome Hiker Hostel, Glencliff

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601451,"The plan is to hike from Kinsman Notch to Franconia Notch today and tomorrow, get resupplied in Lincoln then hit Franconia Ridge beginning Sunday.  Our cousin Alyssa is in the area this weekend which makes a huge difference in how much resupply we need.  
The miles are definitely coming slowly, it’s quite painful for me to see our pace cut from almost 2 mph down to just a hair over 1...very painful.  But there is no other way for us to do this portion of the trail differently. It’s hard to describe, but when I say we are hiking up, I literally mean up...like straight up!  And you negotiate around and over huge stones and boulders.  There rock slabs that are sheer and almost vertical, which you have to walk on.  And in the places where there are no rocks, there are mud pools in its place. I’m talking up to your knees mud pools.   I’m just glad we got new shoes before entering the Whites.
It took us almost 4 hours to hike 4 miles and 2,000 feet of elevation gain going up Mt Wolf this morning.  Thankfully both Curly and I are doing well and making progress, although it is in very small increments.  I met a hiker yesterday who was thru hiking last year and right where we are now he took a fall and split his head open so badly they called in wilderness rescue to evacuate him! Spent a lot of time recuperating and it was only just now, a year later that he is able to be hiking again. It really doesn’t take much out here and I’m superseded that more hikers aren’t injured to that extent.
We had a nice lunch at the top of Mt Wolf and then hiked down to Eliza Brook Shelter. I considered stopping for the day but we wanted to shave off a little more mileage so that tomorrow won’t be as bad.  Began the climb up to South Kinsman and stopped 1.5 miles short. Found a great tent site tucked back off of the trail next to Eliza Brook.  Pitched the tent and are now tucked in. I’m wearing long johns to bed...that tells you it’s getting cold up here at nite.  Thank you Ed and Lisa for sending our winter gear. Hard to believe that it’s late August and we are wearing it again. Tomorrow it’s 8 miles to our pick up point and resupply. I have no idea whatsoever where we are sleeping but that will take care of itself.","Kinsman Notch

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601452,"We had an amazing stealth site next to Eliza Brook about one mile up the mountain. Nothing like a singing stream to put us to sleep!  We got up, had breakfast and was on trail by 7am.  The first summit, South Kinsman Peak, was a mile and a half away from us.  And it was a steep booger as well. Much of our climb was hand over hand as well as hanging on to trees and roots. If you are afraid of heights, the one thing you should never do is look down when you are climbing up, or look up when you are climbing down.  The views always appear scarier and treacherous at those times. Frankly, I have said this before; I don’t know how more people aren’t injured on this trail...perhaps they are and we don’t hear about it.  Anyways, we finally reached the first summit about 830am, and had a beautiful morning plus the top of South Kinsman all to ourself!  For a Saturday when the day hikers come out in droves, this was a treat.  
We began hiking toward North Kinsman which was a mile away, and it was like the day hiker faucet was turned on.  We found ourselves greeting southbound hikers in droves after that, and it was fun to greet folks excited to be outdoors and enjoying nature.  I will say as an aside, hiking these mountains are seriously popular with folks driving from all over New England to take advantage of the Whites.  Once we summited North Kinsman, the rest of our hike was spent coming down to Franconia Notch.
We hiked by our first hut, Lonesome Lake Hut, and stopped in to greet the crew and ask them about general work for stay rules. They were very helpful and it’s good to know that the huts are a place of refuge for hikers who might get stranded in bad weather. Hopefully that won’t apply to us!  The last 3 miles were an easy down with tourist specific grade and elevation change. The result was that we reached our pick up point an hour and a half early. Fortunately, cousin Alyssa was waiting for us.  First stop was lunch.  Then resupply.  Then on to the cabin for shower and pack explosion. Then back out for dinner. Whew, what a great day!  
We are now in bed, updating journals and planning this next stretch of trail.  50+ miles and 4+ days until our next town stop of Gorham. Hoping and praying that great weather continues!","Tent site mm 1810.7
",Franconia Notch,"Aug 25, Sat",7.20
Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601550,"Three years ago, Curly and I section hiked Franconia Ridge.  It was the only time in my hiking experience where I thought we could die.  The weather was horrible, no visibility on an extremely cold day, and no way to bail out.  So here we are three years later, and everything is completely different.  Today was bright and beautiful, at least until early afternoon; visibility was as far as the eye could see.
We took off with cousin Alyssa at 745am, heading for Liberty Springs Campsite.  At this juncture, Alyssa turned right and we turned left, heading in different directions.  Of course we were only hiking towards more of the same terrain as the last four of days.  The difference was that we had 4 mountains to hike over!
Our first climb was over Little Haystack (elev 4780) and it didn’t have much in the way of views, but it put us on Franconia Ridge, and that’s where the hiking gets interesting.  Coming to the summit, you hike into an Alpine Zone, which means trees don’t grow large, vegetation is super fragile, and hikers are required to stay on the trail.  On a day like today there are views as far as the rule can see, really spectacular.  The terrain is described as something out of the Lord of the stings Mordor.  Very eery yet beautiful.  And of course lots of day hikers...droves of them.
Once we hit the ridge, we hiked up and over Mt Lincoln (elev 5089), then Mt Lafayette (elev 5260), and came back down below Alpine Zone. By now both Curly and I are getting pretty wiped out, and the legs are getting wobbly, but one more mountain to climb.  The rest of our afternoon was spent going up and over Mt Garfield (elev 4500), which was probably the most difficult of them all, likely because it was the last one, and it was the most steepest. I think it had the highest degree of difficulty, as we spent way too much time scrambling hand over hand on this part of the trail.  We were shot when we summited this mountain.  Fortunately, we were only two tenths of a mile from the shelter by this time.  We drug our sad selves into the shelter just after 5pm, got our camp set up, ate dinner and now are ready for sleep.  Good night to you all!","Liberty Springs Trailhead

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601772,"We woke up this morning with the intention of hiking ten miles to Zealand Hut and saving extra miles for the next day.  We lucked out and caught some easy miles that will probably not happen again.  The day started with us looking straight up at South Twin Mountain.  South Twin was described to us as one of the most difficult mountains on the trail. With sheer ups that never seem to end, we figured get it over with and then be finished with climbing for the day.  Ha ha, it just doesn’t work that way, but we were happy because South Twin was not the worst we have hiked.  It was difficult for sure, but it gave us enough reprieves of level spaces so that we could catch our breath.
We descended from Twin and immediately began the climb up to Zealand Mountain, via Zeecliff ridge.  The hike was not super difficult and I couldn’t believe it but before we knew it, we had hiked 10 miles and were still feeling pretty good and it was only 4pm.  And then the best news came...
We stopped at Zealand Hut for a quick break and a bowl of soup.  The huts keep hot soup and fresh sliced bread available to their guests all day, and they hikers can buy the goods as they pass through.  It’s an awe start up and the soup was gluten free chicken and rice! Absolutely deelish! But that’s not all.  We were told by three South bounders that the next 4.5 miles would be the flattest from here to Maine! What? 4.5 miles of truly flat hiking?  Do we decided to head out and try to gain those miles today.  And for once, everyone was telling the truth. Probably a first!  It was flat and we cruised until just before 7pm when we hit Ethan Pond Shelter.
This shelter itself wasn’t that spectacular, but the pond it was on was remarkable. Exactly what you would think of when envisioning a mountain lake. Surrounded by stands of pine; huge trout jumping for surface bugs in the twilight...the only thing missing was a moose eating dinner.  Curly got some great pics you can see on her Instagram account.  We ate a vey late dinner, and slept in a shelter for the second night in a row.  Heavy rains are forecasted for tonight, and we want to stay dry.  Tomorrow is the beginning of our hike over the Presidential range.  Mt Washington is on for Wednesday!","Garfield Ridge Shelter 
",Ethan Pond Shelter ,"Aug 27, Mon",14.80
Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601773,"I knew that today was going to be difficult, but what’s new?  We have faced extremely rugged hiking for the last week that eclipses pretty much everything we have done up to this point.  Honest to goodness, there is no way to adequately describe how tough this part of the trail is. And with 300 more difficult miles to go, we are really hanging on.  Not discouraged by any means, but mentally spent because of the constant focus you keep as you hike.  However, before all that began today, we were treated to an additional 2.5 more miles of “easy” hiking down to Crawford Notch.  Then all heck broke loose.
The butt kicking commenced with a 3.7 mile mountain climbing, hand over hand, terrifying hike up to Mt Webster. Only 3,910 feet of elevation, but took us almost 5 hours!  Some parts were so vertical and you had to use both hands and legs to pull yourself up that it didn’t seem believable that 2 middle aged people would be so foolish to do something like this.  Hour after hour passed and the elevation slowly ticked upwards.  As we rose in elevations, incredible views of the mountain range appeared.  I wasn’t sure if the views were worth the hair raising effort but we pressed on.  At one point, Curly slipped and thought she was falling but caught herself. Once she got over the ledge, the tears came, and that bothered me greatly. Not that she was crying, I get that. I was mad that the trail made her cry. I expect this trail to be difficult, it is supposed to be. But the danger is crazy out of control.  And people quit as a result. Just this week, a married couple we know quit and a guy that we have known since the 100 mile marker...both have quit.  350 miles from the finish line, and I totally get it and respect them for their choice. It’s crazy out here.   I digress.
Finally, we got over Mt Webster and things lightened up a touch as we headed to hike over the ridgeline and up Mt Jackson, which is the beginning of the Presidential range. I won’t say that we moved much faster, but I let Curly nap in top of Jackson and that helped a lot!  From there, it was a mostly downward descent towards our final destination for the night, Mizpah Hut.
About 430pm, we drug our tired butts into Mizpah Hut and asked them if they could use 2 tired out old people for “Work For Stay”.  WFS is when a huts crew will allow thru hikers to stay overnight at the Hut, sleep on the dining room floor, eat leftovers from dinner, in return for doing whatever chores they would like to have done.  Curly and I swept and organized the Hut library, and wiped down the shelving where dishes are kept. Probably took 30 minutes of effort between us, and we ate like kings!  Beef stew, rice, broccoli, enchiladas and brownies...all we could eat!  I was absolutely stuffed.  It made up for a seriously crappy day risking our life to hike this trail.
Tomorrow we have to hike completely over the Presidential Range and over Mt Washington, the highest summit in the Whites, and second highest mountain on the AT.  We have no other option but to hike 12 miles to Madison Springs Hut, as that is the only place we can go because we will be above tree line for the entire hike.  It is going to be a very difficult day but I’m praying a beautiful, rewarding one.","Ethan Pond Shelter

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601808,"So we got up at 530am, and were actually out and hiking by 640am.  The fog burned off quickly and it started out as a beautiful day. We were pleasantly surprised as this was not in the forecast.  The sun shine brightly as we made our way up Mt Washington...the views were spectacular and the clouds would hover in and out of the top, giving us brief glimpses of the weather observatory at the summit.
By noon we made our way to the top, and mingled with the tourists who either drove their cars or took the train up!  We ate expensive chili to warm ourselves, as the weather cooled off significantly. The sun disappeared and the clouds covered up absolutely everything once again.  Having to hike 5 plus miles still, we hiked off into the fog, following rock cairns as our guide across the remaining Presidential range.  The going was extremely slow as we picked ur way down, over and around boulder fields. The afternoon fled from us, the weather cooled down, and right st 6pm we hobbled into Madison Springs Hut. It took us almost twelve hours to hike almost twelve miles, consistent with our pace since entering the Whites.  
Fortunately for us, there were no other thru hikers their asking for Work For stay, so we lucked out got a second night in a row.  Within the hour after arriving, the skies blackened, thunder arrived and do did a torrential rain...but we are dry.  Tonite our leftovers consist of turkey, chickpea soup, salad, bow tie pasta and a vegan dark chocolate cake!  All I had to do was the dishes and Curly swept the dining room floor.  Tomorrow we face Mt Madison and a brutal descent into Pinkham Notch, then a resupply at Gorham.","Mizpah Hut

Force Flex and Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601910,"For those of you who are direct and to the point, here is today’s post in the short version:  Curly and I have gotten off trail and our hike is over. It was a great, glorious experience and we thank you for joining us.
For those of you who are interested in a little bit more detail: We woke up this morning to a cold, hard rain just a half mile from the summit of Mt Madison.  Fog engulfed the Hut and visibility was about 50 feet.  With gusts of wind that shook the windows of Madison Springs Hut and bent the tall pines outside, our initial decision to be out by 630am and hiking was delayed until we received the weather report at 715am, which goes out to all the huts via radio from the Mt Washington observatory.  When it came in, the news was not very good.  Continued rain and fog, with gusts of up to 80 mph at the summits.  The Hut master does not stop people from going out, but recommended to us that it would not be wise.  A flood of anxiety came over me as memories of 2015 on top of Franconia Ridge came rushing back.  On that crazy July day three years ago, We faced the only time ever hiking when I was fearful for our lives because of the weather.  The waves of physical and emotional fatigue surrounded and engulfed us both.  What to do?
At that point the choices were to go over the summit or take the Lake View Trail straight down to the trailhead at Rt 2. That trail would descend through tree line and was half the distance to civilization.  It was also NOT the Appalachian Trail and if we took it, it would be the end of our hike.  With great sadness and tremendous relief, we took the Valley View Trail, and with both of us crying pretty much all the way down, our tears littered the trail and this hike was over for us. After 142 days and having hiked 1,863.7 miles...with only 327.2 miles remaining, this grand adventure was complete.
The reasons we ended the hike at this time were pretty simple.  Both of us were physically and mentally “spent”, and we were just wiped out.  I can’t even begin to describe the toll this hike takes on a body and mind, but it’s a tremendous amount.  The stress of planning and executing our days in the rugged wilderness of the Whites left me sleepless at night as I tossed and turned anxious about getting us both safely over these mountains and done before nightfall.  With the Wildcat mountains and Maine in front of us, the difficult hiking before us was not something that either of us were interested in tackling, not in our present frame of mind.
From my immediate perspective, making peace with the reality of being a “quitter” was difficult.  Not finishing was never an option until the last several hundred miles in my mind. Beginning in Connecticut, I began wrestling with this idea of leaving the trail. In a low moment, we were so blessed to have the Weavers and Bartrams “rescue” us, and we trekked on, but as the miles racked up, so did the weariness.  We cut down our time between towns to 3 days in order to carry less weight and eat more high calorie town food.  As the terrain got more difficult, our bodies slowed down. My desire to be summiting Katahdin on my birthday September 4th slipped to the 10th, then slipped further to the 15th, then to the 20th, and finally I just quit estimating...I didn’t want to be out here in late September, even though we were not on a deadline.
For me, being a competitive guy, hiking the AT was about winning, which meant getting to Katahdin, as soon and safely as possible, plain and simple.  I am still processing what has taken place here, but I believe the Lord had bigger lessons in store for me.  This hike was not about the end result, but about the journey between Springer Mountain and Mt Washington.  For Curly, this hike was always about the journey, and she embraced this adventure with her whole heart. In the midst of the past four and a half months, she faced fears and challenges unlike anyone I know, and I am so humbled to call her not only my hiking buddy, but my wife.  But looking ahead to another several weeks of hiking that was more descriptive of mountaineering than a walk in the woods was just not something she wanted to face.  And I didn’t want her to face it.  The burden of being responsible not only for my well being but also for another is huge.  It weighed heavily.  
The bottom line was that we decided we could come down off the mountain totally grateful for the amazing gift of this hike.  The journey couldn’t have been possible without the unconditional support of family, friends new and old, and random strangers we lovingly call “trail angels”.  The friendships made on trail were special and will never be forgotten. Again, it’s about the journey.  This will be my final post for this trip on Trail Journals, so thank you to all those wonderful readers who followed this journey...I hope you enjoyed the trail as much as we did.  May God bless you all richly!","Madison Springs Hut
