Back Track,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581281,"Well after some thought I have decided that I have no clue
what to do. I am currently in the US Navy and about to separate in a few
months. I have plans to attend college soon but since I am currently on deployment
and have horrible planning skills I was unable to complete the necessary application
for me to start school when I get out.
This left me wondering just what to do with the time between
separating and going to school. I could have got a job to last but I know that
it would be hard for me to get a job when I knew I would be quitting in a few
months. So I was left a giant block of months with no purpose.
I’ve always loved to go camping. There was nothing better
than being out in the middle of nowhere and knowing that to survive you had to
rely on yourself. This developed into an appreciation for hiking while I was
stationed on Oahu. I hiked several of the hikes there, The 3 Peaks being my
favorite, and it grew on me. There was nothing more peaceful than climbing up
to the peaks.
With this affection there was nothing else to do but
accomplish the great hike. My sister has talked about trying the Appalachian
Trail so it was naturally my first choice. My date has been set. The 12th
of June I will start my SOBO journey.",,View Entry,"Dec 19, Tue",0
Back Track,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582092,"Well it looks like my plans are starting to come together. I will be doing a SOBO hike starting on the 12th of June. I have started buying what gear I don't have already. Most of what I have gotten is already at home and I am just waiting for my deployment to be over. 
I have already told my parents. My mother wasn't to excited about the ideal of her son going a 2000 mile hike but she is supportive. They will definitely be my biggest support system while I'm on The Trail. They are even buying me a pack and the tent I will carrying as my birthday/Christmas present.
More info on the gear that I am taking coming soon!!",,View Entry,"Jan 13, Sat",0
Back Track,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582140,"So since the third post is the one that makes my journal go public I figured that I should make it a special one. It is recommended that you make a list of reasons why you are doing the hike, what you will do/have after you complete it, and what will happen if you fail.
I like the ideal of this list for the main reasons everyone one else who does it does. It will give me something to look back onto and remind myself of my goals during “the suck”. I did something similar while I was in boot camp and it did prove to be a very useful tool to get me through it.
Without further ado, here is my list.
Reasons why I am hiking the Appalachian Trail:
The challenge and adventure. Where else would you go to find your own stories and adventures than on a 2200 mile journey? I hope to have several stories to relay to my friends and family when I return. 
To institutionalize myself. What I mean about this when you do go to boot camp the first thing they do is break you down. They do this so that they can rebuild you into what they need you to be. I need this journey to reconnect with my inner self.
Meet the people. I love meeting new people. I think I might even do a post about all the people I will meet on the trail.
To have the feeling of accomplishment. No explanation needed here.

When I am done:
Most likely start planning the next adventure. I must admit that I have already been looking into this. The triple crown may be in my future.
Be ready to go back to a civilian lifestyle.
Have a new outlook on life and myself. All those pretty views, how can that not change a person. the only nature some people see is the concrete jungles that people are flock to. I think that being out in nature for extended times will give me new views both figuratively and literally.
Cross that line off the bucket list. Never too young to start the bucket list.

If I succumb to failure:
Feel a little lost. I am very excited and so focused on this hike I think a failure would be pretty rough on me.
Reflect on my adventures. Just because you don’t finish doesn’t mean you won’t have the memories.
Cherish the accomplishments I did have.
Try again. If you fall down, you just have to get back up and keep going. Plain and simple.

 
Well there is my list. I have them wrote down in the journal I plan on taking. Not in so much detail of course but enough to remind me if I need that kick in the butt.
Thanks for reading!",,View Entry,"Jan 16, Tue",0
Back Track,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593017,"Well 3 days until I leave. It has been a while since i posted on here. I almost forgot I was going to be keeping on of these until I was reminded a couple days ago. I was starting to get nervous about hiking the trail but then I realized it wasn't really nerves, it was more excitement and restlessness. I am so ready to head out and start. I even moved my day up. I am now go to summit Katahdin a day early, it was a little cheaper to get there a day earlier as well. 
The Past few weeks getting ready have been really hectic. I didn't even have my pack until a couple weeks ago. I wasn't able to purchase as much as i wanted while i was on deployment but I feel I am almost finishing. I have my clothes hanging up outside drying from the Permathin i sprayed this morning. after that it is just packing everything up. I guess This would be a good time to go over some of the gear choices i have made.
I am carrying an Osprey ATMOS 50 AG. I will be sleeping in a MSR Flylite 2 person tent. It is a trekking pole tent meaning that it is lighter than some tents. I got it on sale at REI which I am grateful for, it can be a little expensive at full price.  for my sleepingbag i went with the Eureka Spero 30 bag. I still havent gotten a sleeping pad yet and im not sure if i will. I am a pretty hard sleeper and have slept on some spot that were harder than rocks. I still might get one while im on the trail if it does end up being an issue but i dont see it being a deal breaker. 
For my last bit on here for today I want to say ""Thank You"" to all my friends and family who have shown support and encouragement in my trip. I would also like to give a shout out to Happy Trails, my local outfitter. Very nice group of people and excellent customer service! I will be updating his once a week or so but i can be forgetful of these things so don't send the search party if i don't. after i get out there i will talk more about my gear and my travels.",,View Entry,"Jun 04, Mon",0
Back Track,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593389,Well my first day on my journey is not going so great. It is now 0449 in the mmorning of the 8th and my bus is officially over an hour late. My first layover in Dallas is only for 45 minutes so I am most likely going to miss my connecting bus. If this bus doesn't show up soon or if they can't help to get me to Bangor on time I may end up trying to get a refund and spending the money to fly. They say that taking a bus is an adventure in itself but right now my decision to take the bus is stopping my adventure from even happening.,,View Entry,"Jun 08, Fri",0
Back Track,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595128,"So I have officialy made it out of the 100 mile wilderness. It was a lot tougher than I thought it would be that is for sure. Between the slow pace due to injury and just wanting to take the scenery in it took longer than I expected.So to start my journey was the climb up Katahdin.  Katahdin is the name given by the Penobscot Indian which means ""greatest mountain"" and they were not wrong. It was a beast and the hardest thing I have ever climbed. It is over 5000 ft elevation gain in a little over 5 miles. It had a nice trail leading up to the top of the tree line, after you got above the tree line it was nothing but nearly vertical bould climbs. I made it up in about 4 to 5 hours and made it back down in a couple. That being said I descended alot faster than I should.Coming down Katahdin to fast I believe I impacted my knee. It made the 100 mile wilderness alot harder. I wasn't able to knock out as many miles as I wanted. Some days I only traveled aroun 8 miles a day and my longest day was 14 miles. It was for the better though though it gave me more time enjoy the beauty of my surroundings. I am currently taking a couple days in Monson to let my knee heal up a little before pressing on.The Hundred Mile Wilderness was harder than expected. It was a tangle of tree roots and rocks but altogether it was worth it. One of the guys I was hiking with told me the lesson of the Wilderness was resilliency. I have deffinitly increased my resilliency. If I could make through the Wilderness then I could do anything. The ability to bounce back from whatever pain or obsitacle and push forward is a skill I will have forever now.With that said I am glad I am past all the bugs, mosquitoes and black flys, for the time being and just going to relax and enjoy my time resting. Until  my next update so long. If there is anything you want me to talk about just tell me!","Katahdin
