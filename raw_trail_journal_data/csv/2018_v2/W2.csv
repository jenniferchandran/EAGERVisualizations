W2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583309,"Starting on March 1, 2018
Hoping to add another section to my AT journey.  Going south this time from Bland, Virginia toward Damascus.  Brother Dan is joining me on this trip also.  He hiked with me on the CDT in September last year.  We did the south San Juans and Northern New Mexico to Ghost Ranch, before my Plantar Fascitis derailed my hike.  
This time we will have lower pack weights due to less water carry and be doing lower miles, basically shelter to shelter.  Have planned a couple 4 day food supplys.  With one town stop in Marion.  
Will be nice to be on a well marked trail.  Having been in the Rockies and AT, I find the AT is just as challenging in elevation changes, but it is the altitude that is the difference.  The grades are in fact steeper on the AT,  than many of the Colorado trail grades, because the CT trail was built for horse travel.  Another interesting thing I discovered is that horses on the Colorado Trail can do about 20 miles max, because they eat grass not high calorie, and protein foods.  Takes a lot of time for them to eat and process the grass.   Fortunately no horses or bikes on the AT trail.  
Will do any equipment changes in the next entry.The weather has been nice lately, hoping for a continuation of that trend.",,Damascus,"Feb 25, Sun",0
W2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583349,"Changes from the CDT hike are minimal.    Waterproof ?  boots.  
I've made a rainbow type tent,  but have been unable to seam seal and test because of the poor weather.   I tested out a tarp tent I made last year, and while roomy, I did not like the sag when wet.  So I am going with my hexamid again.  Hoping to stay in shelters when possible. 
Going back to the sawyer filter for gravity filtration.  Using the rest of the platypus system, but I could not get the platypus filter to work correctly.  Seemed to be a air lock in the filter.  
Starting out with commercial freeze dried dinners.  Works well for the two of us to split a meal.  Works out well for section hikes ,  way too expensive for a thru hike however.  
I added a inexpensive small action camera, as my phone takes very poor pictures.
With 6 lbs food and 2 lbs of water I am hitting 24 lbs.  ",,View Entry,"Feb 26, Mon",0
W2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583862,"Had a nice drive down to Damascus and a good night at the woodchuck hostel.  Great to have breakfast right there.  Found a nice all you can eat buffet at the pizza place near the grocery store.  Got the shuttle up to Bland.  Weather is looking a little sketchy but we will give it a try.  
Light rain and warm temps great us at the trailhead.  Going the 11 miles to Jenkins shelter, drenches us both.  Mostly with sweat as I am pouring it out of my sleeves.  7 hours places us at Jenkins shelter.  We picked up water just before the shelter.  Climbs are already testing my legs.  Brother Dan seems strong, leading the way.   No wildlife is seen, and no tracks on the rainwashed trail.  
Jenkins shelter is empty, although the logbook shows that northbounders have already made it this far.  We settle in the back of the shelter.  After much effort we get a fire going.  And think about drying our clothes.  But a heavy rain shower and wind strike first.  Branches are falling and our fire becomes a smouldering heap.  Undaunted we eat our MH chicken terriake.  And we the rain stops we are able to rekindle the fire.  And warm our hands before turning in.  
Overall a nice day despite the rain.  ","US 52 Bland

W2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584091,"The  wind continued to howl all night, forunately the shelter protected us from the worst of it.  Rain and snow showers continued on and off during the night also.  But very little stuck at our elevation.  The morning found no ice in our water bottles,  but it was below freezing as the table had a coating of ice on it.  We ate and packed up and we away at 9 am.  We only had planned 11 miles to Chestnut Knob, so we had plenty of time.  The trail took us on a slow climb to the rim of Burkes garden.  Rocky at times and increasingly covered with snow.  I was able to wear only a light fleece over my shirt as long as I was moving it was fine.  But stop and the wind tore thru me.    We were not prepared for the rocky trail and the fantastic cliffs on the west side of rim.  Too see the collapse of the land or as some say the moutain in on itself was very impressive.  We followed this rim mostly on the eastern side , downwind side, for 8 miles.  Glad we did as the wind was just as bad as the night before, making it hard at times to place your feet on the snow covered trail.  As the gusts would blow you sideways.  The higher we got the snow was more drifted on the trail, walkin thru 4 -6 inches most of the time.  We stopped at the gap north of Chestnut Knob and were able to fill up with water.  Glad we did , but the 7 extra lbs. was a killer on the 900 ft climb at the end of the day.  The wind here was the worse of day as the valley funneled the wind over this end.  We topped out and were glad to get into a shelter with a door.  It was an icebox however with a concrete floor.  I immediately got my pad blown up and bag out, and jumped in.  My feet were freezing.  After 30 minutes I could feel my feet again and exited to survey the knob.  Some snow cover, and a beautiful view of Burkes garden.  Sunset was inspiring but the cold wind drove me inside.  After our meal, I quickly dove back into my bag, to listen to the door bang most of the night.A great day to be alive and on the trail.","Jenkins shelter

W2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584974,"I Stayed warm during the night, Brother Dan was chilled.  Not sure why He has a nice bag with a down comforter also.  Probably the ice box effect being in the shelter, and a concrete floor.  Wind banged the door much of the night, and howled.  I still got a lot of sleep.  The moon lite up the shelter fairly well.  Morning showed 24 degrees and the wind had not abated at all.  The privy sits on the edge of the ridge and it was freezing with the wind blowing up on ones behind.Breakfast was quick and unforunately after sleeping with his Sawyer filter, brother Dan let it on the table for 1/2 hour.  Forunately I put mine in my pants pocket so we were good.  On the trail at 8:45, mostly downhill today which was nice after yesterday.  We walked into sunshine and some nice fields.  Was unable to get a signal all day on the phones.  Mostly in areas with not many people.  Stopped at Knot Maul Shelter for lunch,  Needed to get a few more miles in, so we went on to Crawfish Valley.  Nice campsites and a privy.  Good water source in th creek.  Tried to get  a fire going , but it just was not to be so.  All we did was create a bunch of smoke that drifted into my tent most of the night.  We shared a MH meal and went to bed.  11 miles today in 6 hours.  Not bad for us.  Although it was down hill most of the way.  Feet 1 blister, one toenail bruised.  No animals but lots of tracks, Deer and small cat (bobcat).  We did see a bird that was not a crow, and a hawk.  Weather nice sunny and warm.  Great day to be on the trail.","Chestnut Knob

W2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585121,"Quite cold in Crawfish Valley, as it was another clear night with a nearly full moon.  Our water bottles actually froze more than they did at the chestnut Knob Shelter.  We packed up at were at the picnic shelter for breakfast by 7.  It is only a hundred yards from the campsites.  While we were eating a day hiker dropped off his car.  Took a while to start.  Knowing we had a longer day we got on the trail at 8:30.  .  Today was a series of Meadows or Cow Pastures, and ridges to go up and over.  We had a little trouble in the wide open meadows finding where the trail picked up.  And the climbs were tough at times with few switchbacks.  I am using my hiking poles more to duck walk up, using my body weight, swaying side to side to assist in the climbs.  It really helps and I am able to stay with Brother Dan.The section Hiker we saw dropped off passes us and tells us we are almost the 1/4 mark.  We arrive there shortly, I still have miles to go to be 1/4 done.  We still are going thru meadows and over turnstiles.  We finally get reception on the phones and are able to get the weather reports.Not looking good in two days time.  Weather which has been beautiful will be going cold, snowy and wet.  That coupled with our arrival in the high country, is giving us second thoughts.We decide to get into Marion before we make any decisions.  Today has been beautiful.There is a mexican restaurant at the Gas Station and good food.  We explore our options to getting into Marion.  We are able to contact Local trail Angle Jim Sparks and his wife and he kindly comes to take us to town.We put off getting to the Walmart to resupply in order to check the weather.  But we do check into the Trail Inn and clean up , laundry , hot showers.  Eat Mexican again a short distance away.  All is good as we hit the sack.","Crawfish Valley

W2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585189,"I would like to say that we had a relaxing time in Marion. But that was not the case.  About Midnight, it appeared someone was having a domestic spat near us.  This went on on and off for three hours. You would just get to sleep and it would start again for 5 minutes.  The room was basic and clean, manager nice but I could understand his reluctance to get involved.  After checking the weather again and seeing the snow coming across the country, we decided to get to the truck and do a day trip up Mount Rogers.   Jim Sparks and his wife were called and more than willing to give us a ride.  They filled us in on the area's history.  As Jim only drives the back roads we were treated to a leisurely drive to Damascus.  They would only take gas money, we were so grateful to them.  We picked up sandwiches for the road and it was over an hour to get the the Mt Rogers parking area.  The day was sunny and warm, an obviously a popular area for day hikers.  We went up the trail and soon began running into the famous pony's. They were brought in to control a thorny shrub, and seem to be doing a good job of it. The Herd it kept to 120 to prevent overgrazing and any additional pony's are culled and sold to good homes.Up we went Making it to the Fat Man's squeeze which was a skating rink.  Being so late in the day we settled on the top on Pine Mountain, rather than going to the top of Mt Rogers.  We had great views, beautiful weather.  Rather different than the balds I had been on.  More rock outcropping.  Somewhat reminiscent of areas in the south san juans.  We headed down and did the Wilbur Ridge trail over a rock outcropping.  Making  to the truck as the sun was setting.  All in all a great day.","Marion
