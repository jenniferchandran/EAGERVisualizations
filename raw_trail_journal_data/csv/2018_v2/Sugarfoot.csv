Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579486,"The Appalachian Trail stretches  either from Maine to Georgia or Georgia to Maine, depending on whom you ask.  North-bound thru-hikers will insist on Georgia to Maine, since that’s the way they experience the Trail.  South-bounders will call it Maine to Georgia for the same reason.  I will be a flip-flopper, meaning that I will start around the middle of the trail in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, hike north to Katahdin in Maine, and then return to Harpers Ferry and hike south to Springer Mountain in Georgia.  So for me, the AT runs both directions.  However you parse it, it’s still about a 2,200 mile long footpath crossing 14 states, including ten of the 13 original colonies: 



Maryland PennsylvaniaNew JerseyNew YorkConnecticutMassachusettsNew HampshireVirginiaNorth CarolinaGeorgia
The other four states are:
West Virginia - separated from Virginia in 1861 becoming the 35th state, the only state to separate from a Confederate state.Vermont - claimed by Massachusetts, New Hampshire and New York, but first a part of New France.  Vermont was an independent republic from 1777 until its admission as the 14th state in 1791.Maine - originally a part of Massachusetts even though not contiguous with the rest of Massachusetts until it became the 23rd state in 1820.Tennessee - originally part of the Province of Carolina, Tennessee became the 16th state in 1796.
The Appalachian Trail not only runs along the spine of the Appalachian Mountains in a physical sense but also runs through the cultural and natural history of the eastern United States.  History comes alive while walking through the faded earthworks of Fort Dietrich Snyder in Pennsylvania where a young lieutenant Benjamin Franklin served in the French and Indian War.  The AT crosses the Overmountain National Historic Trail near the North Carolina Tennessee border, following the route used by patriots marching from what is now east Tennessee to join the Battle of Kings Mountain in the Revolutionary War.  Each gap along South Mountain in Maryland, just to the east of Antietam, has historical markers commemorating Civil War battles.  The trail passes through Harpers Ferry, West Virginia and follows the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal Towpath for about five miles in Maryland, a rare level treat!  The last time I hiked from Georgia to Virginia in 2005, i recorded over 125 species of wildflowers.  The Great Smoky Mountains are said to have more species of trees than all of Europe.  I’ve seen black bear in 11 of the 14 trail states.  
The official length of the Appalachian Trail in 2017 is 2,189.8 miles but will undoubtedly be longer when I hike in 2018.  When I started hiking the AT in 1994, it was merely 2,147 miles long.  No it hasn’t stretched.  Land acquisitions have made it possible to take the AT off roads that it first followed.  The trail has also been rerouted to make the footpath more sustainable and to allow fragile and damaged areas to regrow.  
The trail ranges from 124’ above sea level at the Bear Mountain Zoo by the Hudson River in New York to 6,643’ at Clingmans Dome in the Smokies.   The total elevation gain is about 464,500', equivalent to climbing Mt. Everest 16 times.  The footpath is usually narrow, characterized by roots, rocks, and mud, but occasionally follows old woods roads where hikers can walk side-by-side.   It’s sometimes extremely difficult but never rising to technical climbing, and only rarely a walk in the park.  
A forester and regional land planner Benton MacKaye proposed An Appalachian Trail in a 1921 article in the Journal of the American Institute of Architects.  It’s said that Benton dreamed up the idea of the trail while sitting in a tree atop Stratton Mountain in Vermont, where coincidentally in 1909, James P. Taylor first envisioned the Long Trail that runs the length of Vermont from Massachusetts to the Canadian border.  Some serious mojo on that mountain!  There was sufficient interest to organize the Appalachian Trail Conference in 1925, since renamed the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.  Things really didn’t get moving until a Washington admiralty lawyer Myron Avery became ATC’s chair in 1931.  Benton was a dreamer and inspired others.  Myron was doer and coerced others, resulting in the completion of the trail in 1937, just in time for a hurricane to damage severely the trail the following year.  Myron didn’t declare the trail once again open continuously from Maine to Georgia until 1951.  Being a native of Lubec, Maine, he would have phrased it that way.  
The first generally acknowledged thru-hiker was Earl V. Shaffer in 1948, walking off his experiences of World War II.  I met Earl on his 50th anniversary hike in 1998 in Vermont.  He was hiking north and I was hiking south and we sat down and visited on the steep rocks on the south side of the trail crossing of VT 9, near Bennington.  He was wearing his pith helmet and shouldering his WWII rucksack.  He complained about everything, especially the rerouting of the trail off the roads and out of towns and villages.  It started to rain.  I asked if he were going to put something on, and he replied, “Naw, that’s for sissies!”  Not wanting to out myself as a sissy to Earl, I sat there in rain that soon became torrential, like a Florida thunderstorm, until he broke off our conversation.  Earl did express disappointment that no one wanted to hike with him for very long.  Hmmmm.  
The passage of the National Trails System Act in 1968 led to the Appalachian Trail becoming the first national scenic trail and a unit of the National Park System.  More importantly, this act and subsequent legislation in 1978 led to a vigorous land acquisition program by the federal government, sometimes using condemnation authority.  The last major land acquisition needed to protect the trail wasn’t until 2014.  Most of the Appalachian Trail in the south runs through national forests and national parks, but the trail through much of the mid-Atlantic and New England region threads a narrow corridor of land varying from 50’ to 500’ in width.  A focus now is protecting the landscape through which the Appalachian Trail passes.  I doubt that the acquisition phase will ever truly be completed.
The Appalachian Trail Conservancy continues strong in its mission of preserving and managing the Appalachian Trail, in close cooperation with the National Park Service and U.S. Forest Service, and approximately 32 state agencies.  The real work of building the trail in the early years and the continued maintenance of the trail rests with the 31 very independent maintaining clubs, some of which predate the founding of ATC.  Thousands of volunteers contribute about 270,000 hours to the AT each year and they are the real soul of the trail.  If you want to support me in my hike, consider joining ATC or one of the maintaining clubs!  In the interest of full disclosure, I served on the ATC board from 1997 to 2011 and continued to chair a board committee until this year.  Through my board service and through 25 years of hiking it, the Appalachian Trail has become a real part of my life.  This thru-hike is a celebration of that relationship.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579678,"Thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail means hiking the entire 2,190 miles in a 12-month period.  A thru-hiker is someone who does just that.  When does a hiker setting off on a thru-hike become a thru-hiker?  Some will say, “not until he or she completes the thru-hike.”  Others will say, “At the first step,” which seems to me the more practical answer.  Day hikers often ask, “Are you a thru-hiker?” meaning “Are you attempting to thru-hike?”  Answering with a simple “yes” is most expedient, although it often leads to the 20 questions.
Thru-hikers have a certain look and odor about them.  The look is one of dirt, even filth, and by the time a thru-hiker has hiked several hundred miles, sunken eyes, emaciated upper body, and especially for the men, abundant facial hair.  Then there’s the smell, or more accurately, fetor, known as hiker stench.   In spite of this, it is generally easy to hitch a ride from the trail to the nearest town.  Local drivers know that they are a hikers, but non-locals may mistake them for homeless.  
I have often been mistaken for a thru-hiker.  Do you remember Pig-Pen, the character in Charles Schulz’ Peanuts comic strip?  He was pictured with a unkempt hair and standing in a  swirling cloud of dirt.  That’s me.  I grub up instantly upon setting foot in the woods, so I pass muster as a thru-hiker even on the first day of a section hike.  I attempted a thru-hike in 2013, starting in Georgia.  The first time I was asked if I were a thru-hiker was by Canadian tourists at the stone observation tower on Wayah Bald in North Carolina.  They had driven up.  Answering “yes” to their question was a very special moment for me, an affirmation that I really was a thru-hiker.  The next day, on the 3,000’ descent to the Nantahalla River, my knees gave out most painfully, and I was no longer a thru-hiker.  But for that one moment, I was.
I have been mistaken for a homeless person several times.  There used to be a fine, hiker-friendly bakery where the Appalachian Trail crosses U.S. 206 at Culver Gap, New Jersey.  I was waiting when they opened on a Sunday morning and soon was in a sugar bliss, sitting on the sidewalk in front of the shop, leaning back against the store front, with a bag of doughnuts, orange juice and coffee beside me.  Twice people left with flats of doughnuts for their Sunday school classes and each flipped me a quarter, without saying a word.  “God bless you!” I chimed, not wanting to disappoint them.  
The number of thru-hikers has exploded in recent years.  Please double click on the chart in the upper left hand corner of this page.  Hit the back arrow to return to this page.  The number of northbound (NOBO) and southbound (SOBO) hikers was compiled by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.  I’ve estimated the number of flip-floppers at 8% of the total.  When I started hiking the Appalachian Trail in 1996, there were approximately 900 thru-hikers.  This doubled by 2010 and has increased 150% since then, using the preliminary 2017 figures.   Approximately 82% of thru-hikers start in Georgia, 10% in Maine, and 8% somewhere else, like my planned flip-flop hike.  The current number of northbound thru-hikers overwhelm trail facilities, like shelters and privies, in Georgia and the southern states, and the problem appears only to be getting worse.  ATC is actively encouraging alternative hikes and has started a voluntary registration system so that starting thru-hikers can be aware of the most crowded starting dates (March 1, March 15, March 21, and April 1).  The increase in numbers makes good Leave-No-Trace practices even more crucial.  
I have hiked southbound from Harpers Ferry through Shenandoah National Park several times, most recently in early May 2015 and 2017.  The increase in thru-hiker numbers was staggering.  This year, at Blackrock Hut in the southern district of the Park, I was joined by about 25 thru-hikers filling the shelter and ringing it in tents.  Laurie Potteiger, Information Services Manger for ATC, assures me that I only experienced the vanguard of the 2018 bubble.  I had planned for my 2018 thru-hike to start southbound from Harpers Ferry to Georgia and then to wrap around to Maine, hiking southbound to end at Harpers Ferry.  My experience this year was enough to change my plans so that I can stay ahead of all but the fastest NOBO hikers.
How many of these hikers succeed in completing their thru-hikes?  About 20 to 25 percent, depending on the year.  About a quarter of starting NOBO thru-hikers don’t make it through the 78 miles of Georgia, and only about 50 percent succeed in reaching Damascus, Virginia, 469 miles from the start.  The most common reasons for leaving the Trail are injury, running out money, family issues at home, or simply discovering that walking up and down mountains carrying a heavy pack in the rain is not always fun.  Imagine that!  
The Trail remains a white male bastion, but the percentage of women thru-hikers has increased to 25 to 30 percent, and solo women hikers are no longer a rarity.  I spent one night at Maupin Field Shelter in Virginia with six women.  The shelter is rated for six persons, so we were cozy.  It turned out that each of the women was a solo hiker and none had met any of the others.  The Appalachian Trail Conservancy has made diversity a core value and adopted strategies of partnering with other organizations, expanding its educational programs, and offering guided hikes including an annual African American History Hike in Harpers Ferry.  Hikers tend to be in two age cohorts:  20-somethings, often recent college graduates, and retired folks, like myself.  Not very many middle-aged people have the luxury of spending six-months in the woods.  International hikers are common.  Offhand, I can recall meeting hikers from Canada, Mexico, Jamaica, Chile, Ireland, Scotland, England, France, Denmark, Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and even Yap Island in Micronesia.  It is great fun using idiomatic expressions, like raining cats and dogs, around someone struggling with English.  Until you know someone very well, it is unusual to know their occupation and much about their life off the Trail.  The favorite cocktail party question, “What do you do?” is seldom asked.
Trail names are a tradition on the Appalachian Trail, going back at least to the first thru-hiker Earl Shaffer, who was known as The Crazy One, reflecting the general belief in 1948 that hiking the entire AT in one year was an impossibility.  Names can be given by others or self-chosen.  Some are inspired by physical attributes or traits, like Sasquatch, Red Bandana, Wrong Way and Food Vortex.  Names can reflect geographic origins, like Brooklyn and Cheesehead.   Character names from Lord of the Rings (Frodo, but never Bilbo, Strider and Gandalf) and Star Wars (Skywalker, Princess Leia, and even a Jabba) remain popular, but I have yet to meet a Harry Potter or a Voldemort.  The fastest female thru-hiker, Jennifer Pharr Davis, branded herself Odyssa.  She was a classics major in college.  Gods are a popular theme, and I’ve met Zeus, Hera, and Odin.  One of my favorite trail names in recent years was a young man who introduced himself, “Hi, I’m Demented.”  I replied, “I’m merely deranged.”  And perhaps I am for feeling this compulsion to leave a very comfortable life here in Burlington, Vermont for six months of rain, mud, suffocating heat and humidity, bug bites, things that go bump in the night, and monotonous food for only the occasional clear, cool day, panoramic view, and the company of dirty, smelly disreputable fellow travelers.",,View Entry,"Oct 18, Wed",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579931,"When I tell people that thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail typically takes between five and seven months, with the average being just under six months, the response is usually surprise that it takes so long, even though they know that the trail is almost 2,200 miles long.  I’ve concluded that most people have no idea what a mile is.  Yes, they know that it is 5,280 feet and perhaps they know that a mile is about 2,000 steps.   But knowing something in the mind is quite different than knowing something with the feet.  Think back to the olden times, before smart phones, before the Internet, before the telephone (the kind connected with wires), and even before electricity.  How far would you walk to visit a friend not knowing if they were home?  I think that’s about how far a mile is.  At the average walking speed of 3.1 miles per hour on good surface, that’s about twenty minutes.  The AT is seldom a good surface, and hiking rate of 2 to 2.5 miles per hour is more typical, with an allowance for additional time for steep climbs.  
In general, people accustomed to driving everywhere are clueless about distance.  It’s usually a bad idea to ask a person in a town along the Appalachian Trail how far it is to the grocery store or to the restaurant with the all-you-can-eat buffet.  The answer is invariably, “Oh, it’s about a mile.  It’s real close.”  No, it’s actually several miles along a busy highway without sidewalks.  It’s close to drive but not to walk.  
Hikers are not much better at estimating distance.  I’ve learned not to ask hikers coming the other direction how far it is to the spring, the shelter, or to the top of the mountain.  It’s always further than they say, and that might be because all miles are not the same length.  Morning miles are much shorter than late afternoon miles.  Downhill miles are shorter than uphill miles. Switchbacked uphill miles are infinitely long.  If I really want to know how far something is, I can bring out my iPhone, open Guthook’s AT Guide, activate the phone’s GPS and place myself accurately on the map.  Tapping the spring, shelter or other feature returns a very accurate distance along the Trail.  What about when I’m asked how far something is on the Trail by hikers coming the other direction?  My routine answer is a cheerful, “It’s just over the next ridge!”  That’s usually a lie, but makes them so happy, at least until the reach the top of the ridge and see only endless ridges stretching beyond.
Most people are not satisfied learning that it takes about six months to hike the Appalachian Trail.  They will followup with “How far do you walk in a day?”   The math is really simple.  Dividing 2,200 miles by 183 days yields 12 miles a day.  A five-month hike means averaging about 14.5 miles a day.  In reality, there are occasional rest days in town, what hikers call zero days, meaning zero miles hiked.  I prefer short mileage days going into a town and leaving a town, so I can cram in more meals.  So most full hiking days are between 15 and 20 miles, depending upon terrain and condition of the tread way.  That would be very optimistic for New Hampshire and parts of Maine.  My longest days have been 28 miles and required supreme motivation, food in one case and freezing weather in another.  But that’s nothing compared to the current record for the fastest unsupported AT thru-hike, set in 2017 by Joe McConaughy (Stringbean) of 45 days, 12 hours, and 15 minutes.  That’s an average of 48 miles a day!
I won’t be doing that.  One advantage of a flip-flop hike like I’m planning is that there is no time pressure.  Northbound thru-hikers face the need to complete their hike before the northern terminus on Katahdin in Baxter State Park in Maine closes for ice and snow usually in mid-October.  Southbounders can’t start until June or July and face the risk of snowstorms in the southern mountains in November and December.  As I write this, NOAA is forecasting a 20% chance of snow for Newfound Gap in the Smokies tonight.  
I won’t be facing those constraints.  I will start in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy’s annual Flip Flop Festival, starting hiking on April 29 following a send-off pancake breakfast.  My cousin Debbie will be joining me for the first 100  miles to Boiling Springs, Pennsylvania, and we are planning short daily distances, mostly under 10 miles.  I’ve learned that the longer the hike, the shorter my distances the first couple of weeks should be, to allow my body, and especially my knees, to adjust to life on the trail.  My distances will increase, but I’m not planning many 20 mile days.  I won’t be setting any records, although there is one record that is tempting.  Tomorrow, Dale Sanders (Greybeard) will complete his Appalachian Trail thru-hike at age 82!  Maybe in another 17 years, I can break his record.  I have the luxury of taking some time off during my hike as well, without fear of snow.  I should reach the Hudson River around the end of May.  I’ll take Amtrak’s Ethan Allen Express up to Rutland, Vermont and spend a few days back home in Burlington letting my feet rest after the rocks of Pennsylvania.  I’ll also come home for a few days in late June from somewhere in Vermont, to switch out my sleeping bag and jacket for warmer ones before hiking New Hampshire and Maine.  After summiting Katahdin in early August, I’ll be home for several weeks, until the temperatures in Virginia start to moderate.  Around Labor Day, I’ll return to Harpers Ferry and complete my hike on Springer Mountain in Georgia in early November.   
I don’t have to rush to complete my hike in time to start a college semester, like so many of the younger hikers.  I don’t have limited vacation days from work.  Oh, the joys of retirement!  I’ve made a schedule, but mostly because I enjoy planning hikes.  It won’t be controlling me.
If I stick to my schedule, I will actually hike on 166 days, including near-zero (NERO) days into and out of towns, for a daily average of 13.2 miles.  Actual elapsed days, including two weeks home in August will be 191 days.  “If you want to make God laugh, tell him about your plans,” says Woody Allen.  Woody Allen doesn’t hike, but he does have a English country-style Manhattan townhouse, and that ought to count for something.",,View Entry,"Oct 25, Wed",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579978,"In six months, my husband Tom will drop me off at Burlington International Airport in time for a 6AM flight to Washington National Airport, known by some as Reagan Airport.  I would rather take Amtrak, but American Airlines offers incredibly inexpensive nonstop flights to National.  My cousin Debbie will fly in from Albany, New York about the same time, and we’ll spend the day visiting museums in Washington and the new REI close to Union Station to purchase things not allowed on planes.  Things like fuel canisters are not allowed on Amtrak either, but I’ve never had my pack inspected on Amtrak.  In the late afternoon, we will take the Capital Limited from Union Station to Harpers Ferry, spend the next day at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy’s Annual Flip Flop Festival, and on Sunday morning after a send-off pancake breakfast, we’ll start our hike.  The actual hike doesn’t cause me too much worry or excitement.  I’ve hiked all of the Appalachian Trail before, everything south of New Hampshire at least twice and some states, notably West Virginia, Virginia, Vermont and Georgia, multiple times.  There are some sections that I do not relish hiking again, but I’ll be getting Pennsylvania from Duncannon to Delaware Water Gap out of the way relatively early in my hike.  So what has me concerned as I look ahead?
Tom and I have been together 41 years and married for three.  Pretty much our only separations longer than a week have been when I’ve attended professional conferences or gone on my annual hikes.  It’s easy for me.  I’m off either being bored out of mind (tax conferences) or doing something I love (hiking), but I worry about Tom being home alone.  Tom enjoys walking, even in the woods if the trail is maintained to a high standard, meaning little in the way of rocks, roots or mud, thus eliminating most of the Appalachian Trail.  Tenting in the woods, sleeping side-by-side with strangers in a shelter, or in a bunk room of a hostel would not give him pleasure.  He is very supportive, and I’m grateful for that.  There’s nobody I would rather be with, so it will be difficult being away for so long.  Do you mind another story?
In 2001, when I hiked Maine to finish my end-to-end series of section hikes, I encountered a camp group at one of the shelters.  Most long-distance hikers dislike being around camp groups or scouts, but I’ve usually found them enjoyable and entertaining.  Invariably, they cook too much food, and that is a welcome opportunity.  Have you noticed my obsession with food yet?  My technique is simple.  I sit on the outskirts of the group, not too far from the inevitable outcast of the group, the one who doesn’t quite fit in for whatever reason and would have been me at that age.  If I just sit quietly looking grandfatherish, pretty soon the child will start talking.  In this case, the boy was younger than the others, maybe 10 years old.  His parents owned the camp in Maine where he had spent every summer of his life, but this was his first time on an “away trip,” as he put it.   At one point, he whimpered, “I know it’s called being homesick, but I never knew it really hurt!”   Just saying it seemed to help him, and soon enough, I was chowing down on an excellent burrito.  I don’t know if my wet eyes were from empathy or gratitude.  
I don’t think I’ll be whimpering from homesickness, but I am planning on getting home twice during my northbound section and spending a couple of weeks there before starting my southbound section.  Some hikers decry the advent of cell phones and personal electronic devices.  I welcome the opportunity to connect with Tom by phone or text, and on most days, I can get a signal.   It helps a lot, almost as much as a big juicy burrito.  Nonetheless, homesickness is one of my worries six months out.
My other big worry is my knees.  I was first diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the knees in 1997, when they swelled up like grapefruits and I hobbled into Bland, Virginia, truly an aptly named community.  Prednisone, industrial-strength naproxen, and codeine for sleep got me through the hike.  I ignored the diagnosis until 2002, when I had to bail from a southbound hike on the Long Trail, which I completed the following year.  My family doctor referred me to a rheumatologist who after eight hours of examination and testing eliminated all other inflammatory processes.  Those doctors along with an orthopedist staged a mini-intervention late that day to encourage me to stop running, to save my knees for hiking.  That’s when I first heard the dreaded words, “Progressive and degenerative.  You’ll eventually need knee replacements.”  I tried every remedy available from denial, to glucosamine, to proteolytic enzymes, to various straps and braces without success.  The episodes came more frequently and as often as not, my hikes had to be terminated early.  In 2010, I consented to an arthroscopic procedure to release my patellae by lengthening the quadriceps tendons.  Following therapy, I was pain free and even able to run some again.  Hiking was good.  
So in 2013, I attempted a traditional northbound AT thru-hike.  It was probably a doomed hike from the get-go.  My knees hurt from the first step at Amicalola Falls State Park, the start of the approach trail to Springer Mountain, but it was the 3,000 foot descent to the Nantahala River that did them in.  I could smell the heavenly scent of bacon wafting up from the restaurant far below and moved much too quickly and carelessly.  I was crippled and flew home from Asheville the next day.  There was a sign in the airport advertising the services of the University of North Carolina Orthopedic Services, showing a photo of a hiker who looked a lot like me.  The tagline was, “Joints are replaceable; hiking is not.”  
I was also under a diagnosis of prostate cancer at the time, at a stage when treatment was advisable.   I had read a strong study indicating that delaying treatment for up to nine months after diagnosis had no effect on outcomes.  I mentioned that to my urologist, who reminded me that statistically that was true for a population of patients but that I was a population of one.  I accepted the risk, but I’m sure it was preying on my mind during my hike.  So when I got home from the aborted thru-hike, I dealt with that.  You don’t need the details, but I was fortunate in choosing an excellent surgeon and had minimal side effects.  Four-and-a-half years later, I can consider myself cured.  
After dealing with that, I sought out another orthopedic surgeon.  We got as far as selecting the artificial joints and discussing anesthesia, but first he had to attend an international conference.  He came back convinced that within five years, stem cell regenerative therapy would be the standard treatment and that he would be regarded as a barbarian for having done replacement surgery.  He was determined to hold me together until then with cortisone injections and custom off-loading braces.  If you are wondering, viscosupplemention is not of proven benefit for my particular condition.  I didn’t like walking and hiking in the braces, but they worked, awkward as they were.
We fully retired in 2016 and moved to Burlington, Vermont from Sarasota, Florida, a move we both feel was one of our better decisions.  We love it here.  Vermont is the 49th state in population, with only Wyoming having fewer residents, and the population is stable.  This is so radically different from Florida.  When we left there were over a dozen construction cranes marring the skyline of Sarasota.  Burlington has a population of 43,000, making it the least populous city in the United States to be the most populous city in a state.  The downtown is set on a hillside, with Lake Champlain at the bottom (obviously) and the University of Vermont on a plateau at the top.  After renting for several months, we purchased a condominium that abuts UVM near the top of the hill.  Our unit overlooks the city and the lake, with panoramic views of the Adirondacks across the lake.  We can see into the High Peaks and on the clearest days, see the summit of Mt. Marcy through a gap north of Giant Mountain.  The downtown is compact, and as you would expect in a college town, highly walkable.  Virtually every place we go is within a 1.2 mile radius, and unless we leave town, we walk further in a week than we drive.
I did a short hike on the Appalachian Trail in Vermont in 2016, made even shorter by the failure of the braces.  I sought out the orthopedic services at the University of Vermont Medical Center.  By then I was duck-walking, stairs and standing were painful, and walking more than a hundred feet hurt.  After confirming the diagnosis, they required a physical therapy evaluation, something that none of my previous doctors had suggested.  I was quite skeptical and just wanted to proceed with the replacement surgery, but they gave me no choice.  I had four sessions with a physical therapist learning various warm-up stretches and exercises.  
The knees improved remarkably to the point that I wouldn’t even consider replacement surgery at this time.  By the way, a standard protocol for stem cell regenerative therapy remains at least five year out, and there are substantial doubts if the regrown cartilage is equivalent to the factory original.  I did a test hike this summer, heading south from Harpers Ferry, including a 13.5 mile section in Northern Virginia known as the “Roller Coaster.”  Because of a very narrow right-of-way, the trail is forced to follow the razorback ridge line, with ten ascents and descents.  Steep trail inevitably erodes, so the tread way is rocky and uneven, and hell on the knees.  I was tentative at first and held my distances down, but my knees performed well.  
Since returning, I’ve intensified my weight-training and aerobic workouts, adding the physical therapy exercises to my almost daily routine.  I’m able to walk long distances, up and down the hills of Burlington and nearby state parks, without any discomfort.  At this point, only genuflecting is out of the question and there isn’t much call for that on the Appalachian Trail.  So I’m optimistic that I’ll be able to complete a thru-hike.  Even so, I’m planning to limit my daily mileage and to take days off when needed.  Still, it’s a worry six-months out.
Very little of my gear will be new for this hike, and I’m asking Santa for very little this year.  I started carrying a bear canister this summer and found that my ultra-lightweight backpack did not handle it well.  A pack I used previously does, but is worn out.  So I’ll be replacing it before starting my thru-hike.  I’ve had Lyme Disease once, so I will be purchasing clothing made of pyrethrin-treated fibers and sending my hiking socks off for treatment.  I don’t mind dousing myself with DEET on a short hike, but six-months of exposure can’t be a good thing.   About the only other purchase I’ll make is a 2018 edition of the Appalachian Trail Data Book published by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.  It’s a compact light-weight listing of shelters, road crossings, water sources and the like.  Mostly, I’ll be relying on a PDF of ATC’s Thru-Hikers’ Companion for detailed information and an app on my iPhone called Guthook’s AT Guide, but I want to have something in paper in case I either lose or break my iPhone.  
It’s been an unusually warm fall here in Burlington, but winter will be here soon enough.  Come April, I’ll be chomping at the bit to fly south to warmer climes and the start of my thru-hike!",,View Entry,"Oct 27, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579979,"Up to now, most of what I’ve written is fairly factual, and I don’t think too many Appalachian Trail hikers would take exception, although hikers tend to be very opinionated and feel free, even obligated, to share those opinions.  So as a reminder, everything I write is JUST MY OPINION.  Wherever two or three hikers are gathered, there will be at least four or five opinions.  So, please feel free to disagree.  You will anyway.  Just don’t call me nasty names.  
In 1994, when I started to section hike the Appalachian Trail, it was commonly said that it cost $1 per mile to hike the AT, not including gear and transportation to and from the trailheads.  Expressed in 2017 dollars, that’s $3,460 for a thru-hike today.  That’s probably on the low side, but It can be done for that.  Some members of trail forums like www.whiteblaze.net continue to report doing it for half that.  Hiking for $1 per mile today or even $1.50 per mile means going into and out of towns on the same day, eating very few restaurant meals, enjoying very few beers and hiking very fast to get it over with as quickly as possible.  God bless those hearty souls and more power to them.  A more common estimate today, and one that the Appalachian Trail Conservancy provides on its website, is $1,000 a month.  
This strikes me as very reasonable and a good figure for budgeting.  I expect my hike to cost more.  While I enjoy the primitive life on the Trail, I also enjoy a bit of luxury in town.  Not all trail towns offer the option of luxury, but a surprising number of bed & breakfasts along the trail welcome hikers.  My estimate for trial food, town meals, supplies and lodging for my thru-hike is $9,000.  I will be working part-time this coming tax season in a local CPA firm.  I had not planned on that so my earnings are “found money,” and I plan to spend it without guilt.  
Hostels along the trail commonly cost about $35 per night.  One of the better hostels is the Green Mountain House Hiker Hostel in Manchester Center, Vermont, an immaculate two story house east of town center.  The $35 rate includes a comfortable twin or bunk bed with clean linens, blanket and pillow; showers & bathtubs with towel, soap and shampoo provided; washer, dryer and detergent; a comfortable lounge with TV and free long-distance phone calls; breakfast supplies for hikers to cook their own; ice packs for sore knees; a shuttle into town; and most importantly a caring innkeeper, Jeff Taussig.  Bears Den Hostel is located 18 miles south of Harpers Ferry and operated by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club.  Thirty dollars gets you a bunk, sheets, towel, shower, laundry, a frozen pizza, a soft drink, a pint of Ben & Jerry’s, and pancake supplies for breakfast.   Then there are hostels where you would hesitate to board a tomcat that you truly loathe and one that even smells like cats-gone-wild.  
I’ve never stayed in a  bed & breakfast that hasn’t been at least pleasant and often a true delight.  Yes, it costs several times more than a hostel, but after a week in the woods, don’t you deserve a little pampering?  This year, two nights in the Iris Room of the Belle Hearth Bed & Breakfast in Waynesboro, Virginia restored my spirits.  The breakfast at Woodward House in Front Royal, Virginia will leave even a thru-hiker groaning and not wanting food for at least several hours.  
Trail motels and hotels are highly variable in both amenities and price.  One hotel that will remain nameless — but ask any thru-hiker — featured doors that didn’t lock, a single hanging naked low-wattage light bulb, a mattress that required a ground cloth to avoid touching it, and a shared bath so filthy that squatting was advised. It cost less than most hostels and, fortunately, did not include breakfast.   Then there are places like the Hanover Inn in Hanover, New Hampshire, owned by Dartmouth College, and the Stonewall Jackson Hotel in Staunton, Virginia, adjacent to the Blackfriars Theatre of the American Shakespeare Center, both listed as Historic Hotels of America by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. It’s easy to exceed $1,000 per month with places like these convenient to the Trail.
Highly sought out restaurants in trail towns are those with all-you-can-eat buffets, such as Ming Garden in Waynesboro, Virginia and Daniel’s Steak House in Hiawassee, Georgia, and any place featuring pizza.  Staying in town occasionally for two nights (taking a zero day) has the advantage of allowing you to sate your hunger the first night and to seek out fine dining the second night, but first verify that you will be seated in your cleanest trail clothes or rain suit.  There was a short-lived northern Italian restaurant in Pearisburg, Virginia with chef-owner Giovanni Guarini.  He was very proud of his knowledge of Italian wines and cuisine, so I challenged him to prepare a tasting dinner.  Six courses and five wines later, he succeeded in proving that his pride was not misplaced, even if his restaurant was.  It hadn’t a chance in Pearisburg.  It took a taxi ride from Lee, Massachusetts, but dinner at the Red Lion Inn in Stockbridge with my cousin Debbie, who will be joining me a the start of this hike, was certainly memorable.  They wouldn’t seat us in the main dining room because of our trail attire, but did offer us the same menu and wine list in their tavern.  It was a cold day, and we started in the downstairs Lion’s Den with an excellent French onion soup and bottle of Merlot.  Then in the tavern we paired a well-aged Grgich Estate Cabernet Franc with sea scallops, lemon sorrel, and shiitake mushrooms rolled in phyllo tubes, roasted to crispiness, and served with a champagne sauce.  Dinner like that, you remember! My latest surprise find was the Green Leaf Grill in Waynesboro, Virginia.  Go for the house-made cheesecake with expresso sauce if nothing else.
I remember the fine lodging and fine dining I’ve experienced along the Appalachian Trail because it stands in stark contrast to most nights spent snuggled in a sleeping bag, on a thin mattress pad, in a tent not large enough to hold me and my pack, and a dinner consisting of a Knorr’s noodle dinner and a pouch of tuna.  I’ll discuss trail food in a later posting.  Bon appétit!",,View Entry,"Oct 27, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580083,"When I started hiking the Appalachian Trail back in the olden days, before cell phones went digital, staying in touch meant calling home from pay phones in towns.  They looked like the photo in the upper left.  You found them roadside at gas stations and in the entrances of grocery stores — places with lots of ambient noise — and either fed them coins or used a phone calling card.  When I spoke with Tom, I would tell him when I expected to be in the next town, but not to panic if I were a day or two late.  It never happened, but if I had failed to reappear in timely fashion or if Tom had needed to get in touch with me between towns for a true emergency, he knew he could call the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and they would pass on information to the appropriate agency who would then try to locate me. Here’s an example of how that works. 
In the late 1990’s, I met a forest ranger at a road crossing in the George Washington & Jefferson National Forests in Virginia.  He asked if I had seen a thru-hiker named Copper Top, distinguished by his flaming red hair.  I had passed him when he was stopped for lunch a couple of miles back.  His father had suffered a sudden and serious illness, and his family was trying to get Copper Top back home quickly.  The rangers had narrowed down where Copper Top was on the Trail by knowing where he was when he last phoned home and by checking for his entries in the shelter registers.  What are shelter registers?
Maintaining clubs place registers in shelters for hikers to record their observations and comments.  They are most often black and white marble composition notebooks, protected from the weather by a plastic bag.  Before cell phones, they were the primary way how you learned who was hiking ahead of you and hikers behind you found out about you.  The entries were often simple, “In for a break, hiking on.  Smeagol 7/15/95,” or provided useful information like, “Spring in front of shelter is dry, but follow the forest road 2/10’s behind the shelter to an excellent piped spring.  Igor 9/3/97,”  or might be a warning, “Caution:  Yellow jacket nest 1 mile north flagged in red.  Hives 8/2/02.”  There might also be complaints about the weather, the condition of the trail, and even one’s fellow hikers who might have the temerity to snore or make other noises at night.   The language could be colorful, sometimes accompanied by illustrations.  
In 2005, I hiked up from Georgia to the Appalachian Trial Conservancy Biennial Meeting held at East Tennessee University in Johnson City.  In the Cherokee National Forest in Tennessee, I met three young men standing alongside the trail who didn’t seem like they belonged there.  They were wearing blue jeans and cotton shirts, which just isn’t done since cotton weighs a ton when wet and holds moisture against the skin, and seemed as though they were somewhere else, high as kites but not in a mellow marijuana way.  I had noticed an empty blue Mallinckrodt ether drum down in a nearby cove, and had found several ignition tubes (thick walled test tubes) in a shelter fire pit.  I wrote a warning to hikers in the next shelter register.  An enforcement ranger from the Cherokee National Forest found me at my meeting and wanted complete descriptions.  She asked about their teeth, which were rotten.  I didn’t know, but I’ve since read that extensive tooth decay often accompanies methamphetamine use.  I still don’t know how they found me based solely on my trail name in the register.
Today, carrying a cell phone is nearly universal on the Appalachian Trail, and pay phones have gone the way of rotary dial telephones and slide rules.  My older brother was a leading pay phone engineer in the 1990’s.  The advent of cell phones and the disappearance of pay phones led to his unemployment.  Imagine being a buggy whip maker in 1908 when the Ford Model T debuted. It didn’t matter how elegant his designs; no one wanted a pay phone anymore.  At least the Amish still use buggy whips.  They may also use cell phones, with the permission of their local bishop.
Cell phones are usually turned off or placed in airplane mode to conserve battery life, but most hikers will check them daily for messages and to let folks back home know that all is well.  They are also used among hikers to arrange meetings and get togethers.  I used to think that the casual use of cell phones on the trail was a bad thing, an invasion of the sanctity of the woods, but I came to see them as actually enhancing the community of hikers.  I’m still enough of a Luddite to shun most social media.  
Cell phone coverage is not universal. There are many blank areas on the coverage maps, which at any rate tend to exaggerate signal strength.  Verizon seems to offer the best coverage.  There is usually a strong enough signal to be had somewhere most days, often from the higher ridges or viewpoints.  There are areas, notably northern Virginia and Maine, where signals are rare.  At Loft Mountain Campground in Shenandoah National Park, for example, reception can be found only at certain seats in the amphitheater and, as I discovered this year, in tenting area 45-50. 
A small percentage of hikers carry a SPOT or other satellite messaging system that can send out an “all’s well” message to friends, summon help in an emergency, or even provide real-time tracking on a map.  Hikers attempting to set records often carry such a device to document their hikes, although it really only proves that the device hiked the entire trail and not the hiker.  The latest generation SPOT Satellite GPS Messenger weighs only four ounces and costs about $150, but requires a $200 yearly subscription.  
Smart phones have more uses than just communication.  I use mine as a camera, a watch, a GPS-based navigation system, and for recording my entries for copying and pasting into this journal.   I also download e-books.  I carry a 10,000 milliamp hour external battery weighing 6.3 ounces that will recharge my iPhone three times, more than enough to get to the next town.   Other popular uses, just not by me, are for music and audio books, and it is increasingly common to see hikers plugged in while hiking.  I still find that disturbing, to a greater degree than seeing people walking down city streets holding conversations with invisibles.
Even with cell phones, most hikers feel a tension between life on the trail and life off the trail.  I’ve often heard younger hikers speak of their trail lives and their real lives, as though they are separate things.  Hikers who abandon their thru-hikes are referred to in the past tense, like they had died.  “Twisted Elf was a good person and a strong hiker.  I’ll miss her.”  All that’s missing is a somber “may the souls of the faithfully departed rest in peace” and a recitation of the 23rd Psalm.  Sometimes staying in touch with loved ones only makes you feel further away.  
One thing I’ve observed in myself is that the longer I’m out on a hike, the less interest I have in news, other than the weather, which becomes a compulsive interest.  Many times in trailside hotel rooms, I find myself watching the Weather Channel for hours at a time, hoping that the forecast for rain and more rain is magically going to change to clear and cool if I just keep watching.  I am tempted to avoid all news during this thru-hike and then see how long it takes me to re-immerse afterwards.  I missed the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War in 1967 when I was on an island in Casco Bay, Maine participating in an oceanography program after my junior year of high school.  I would like to miss more wars.",,View Entry,"Oct 30, Mon",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580197,"People usually start by asking simple questions, like where does the Appalachian Trail go, are you a thru-hiker, or how long will it take?   If the hiker shows a willingness to continue the conversation, perhaps in the hopes of a ride into town or even an invitation to dinner, the questions quickly become more personal and start to address fears.  Will you be hiking alone?  Aren’t you afraid of bears, hillbillies and other hairy creatures?  Will you be carrying protection?
It doesn’t take too many of these questions from very many people before the hiker starts to realize that the fears being raised are primarily fears of the inquisitors, and the questions translate into statements, and very honest ones at that.  I would be terrified to be in the woods alone, especially at night.  I would be terrified of bears, hillbillies and other things that go bump in the night.  At the very least, I would want an armed bodyguard, porters to carry my gear, to make my camp, and to cook gourmet meals.  How do I respond?
I start by acknowledging the fear as one I’ve had or more probably continue to have.  Sometimes I’ll tell a story to illustrate the fear or even to magnify it, a story that ends with the hero (me) conquering the fear.  I’m short, old and gray, and pretty harmless.  If someone like me can handle it, think how much better you can!
Yes, I will be hiking alone for the most part.  Anticipating my first solo hike in 1994, I was scared, but I kept reminding myself of Grandma Gatewood.  She was the age I am now, an Ohio farm woman and a great grandmother, when she set out in 1957 to hike the Appalachian Trail, after reading an article about it in National Geographic Magazine.  I imagine her saying, “Hell, I can do that, and it certainly can’t be as hard as the life I’ve had,” a life that included a wife-beating husband, 11 children, and threats of commitment.  She carried a  denim gunnysack slung over one shoulder.  Her only shelter and protection from the rain was a plastic shower curtain, and she wore Keds sneakers.  A pair of her sneakers is enshrined in Damascus, Virginia like a relic of the true hiker.  She ended up hiking the AT three times.  Whenever I managed to scare myself about hiking alone, I would say to myself, “If Granny could do it, I can do it,” and that became one of my hiking mantras.    
In June 1994, I flew up to Atlanta and my brother Ron and his five-year old son Brian drove me to Amicalola Falls State Park in Georgia.  The official beginning of the Appalachian Trail is 8.8 trail miles and 2,082 vertical feet to the northeast of the park.  The approach trail starts at a stone archway outside the park visitors’ center.   Back then the trail ascended steeply 850 vertical feet on muddy switchbacks to the park road at the top of Amicalola Falls, the highest waterfall in Georgia.  It’s been replaced by a beautifully constructed wooden staircase with 604 steps, but it remains a rude awakening.  Brian walked with me while Ron wisely drove to the top of the falls.  At the time I weighed 153 pounds and my pack weighed 58 pounds.  Brian deftly skipped up the trail while I tried mightily not to huff and puff and fall flat on my face.  I was ecstatic when we made it to the top of the falls and Ron and Brian drove away leaving me alone in the woods.  I hiked another ten feet so as to be hidden from the road that leads to the park lodge.  Then I collapsed and struggled out of my massive  Gregory Robson pack that weighed nearly eight pounds empty.  I tried eating one of the two dozen pemmican bars I had brought.  According to the Canadian Encyclopedia. the word pemmican derives from the Cree pimikan meaning manufactured grease.  It’s a native American energy bar made from powdered dried meat, an equal amount of melted fat,  and dried berries or fruit.  I would rather starve than eat another one.  From this I learned a valuable lesson: only bring foods that you actually want to eat, not foods that you think you ought to eat.  I should have loaded up on Little Debbie Oatmeal Cakes.  For me, pemmican meant pack ballast and I couldn’t wait to get rid of it at the first trashcan.  
As I started to climb the first mountain, Frosty Mountain, a summer thunderstorm moved in and settled over the summit.  I could see lightning striking the ridge above, so I again sat down on the muddy trail and covered myself and my pack with my rain jacket.  And I cried, not out of fear but out of frustration.  Four hours later, the storm moved on, and I tented on the summit, near where there used to be a fire tower.  I never found the spring mentioned in the guidebook, but it started raining again, easily filling my cook pot.
Two nights later, still alone, I slept in the nearly new Hawk Mountain Shelter, and was awakened by U.S. Army Rangers training for the imminent invasion of Haiti.  Blackhawk helicopters buzzed the shelter at treetop level, dropping things that flashed and made a lot of noise.  I wasn’t scared, just angry.  
Three days later I reached Neels Gap where there is an outfitter conveniently located right on the trail, the only place where the trail actually passes through a building.  After a night at Blood Mountain Cabins with an endless shower, and after shipping home 15 pounds of useless stuff including binoculars and a chair kit, things got much better.  My pack then weighed only 43 pounds, which was about typical for the period.  
I was surprised by another violent thunderstorm as I climbed Tray Mountain, and the temperature plummeted about 15 degrees.  Did I stop and put on a warm layer and a rain jacket?  Of course not; I only had to complete the climb and the shelter would be right there.  As I neared the summit, a ray of sunshine broke through and hit a mica-laden rock.  I stopped and stared, mystified.  In my near hypothermic stupor, I thought I had already submitted and was going down to the shelter.  I had gotten turned around and hiked all the way back down the mountain, discovering my error only when I reached the campsite at the base.  Did I just pitch my tent there or put my rain gear on?  Of course not; I only had to climb the mountain again and the shelter would be right there.  Up and up, switchback by miserable switchback, I climbed, getting colder and colder.  This time I reached the summit, but in the gloaming, a lovely Scottish word meaning twilight, I missed the sharp left turn and started climbing down a rock face, reaching a small cave facing due east.  Perhaps it was a Cherokee spirit cave, and if I had fasted for three days, I would have received my spirit name and been invited into the mountain to dance with the Nunnehi.  Instead, in a rare moment of lucidity, I said to myself, “Granny didn’t do this; Granny didn’t do this,” and somehow climbed back up with that miserable pack, shortly reaching the shelter.  A couple, Skinny Badger and Hikes with Hooves, who were the two teachers at a Seventh Day Adventist School in rural Wisconsin, and one of their students, Volcano, were there and gave me something warm to drink.  I quickly recovered.  
I also had a tornado skip over me at Plumorchard Gap Shelter, entertained by a father trying to gather his sons around him as he prayed to Jesus for deliverance from the storm, while his father-in-law howled with laughter at his panic and his piety. 
It was a lovely first solo hike, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  With everything that happened, I never had time to fear being alone, and it’s never bother me since.  I ended the hike as planned at Wallace Gap in North Carolina, on Old Highway 64 between Franklin and Murphy.  Rainbow Springs Campground (it no longer exists) was a short walk to the west.  Bill Bryson in A Walk in the Woods was less than spellbound by the accommodations and food, but my experience was nothing like his. Jensine and Buddy Crossman were gracious hosts who offered to do my laundry for me without charge, warned me off the bottomless pot of chili, and sold me bacon, eggs and bread as a safer alternative.  They made sure I had a clean towel and even provided toilet paper, expressing confidence that I wouldn’t steal it as so many others had.  After almost two weeks in the woods, most of it spent alone, I was grateful for every hospitality they offered, and perhaps that is the difference.
I’ll be starting this hike with my cousin Debbie but I expect to hike alone most of the time.  With the explosion in the number of hikers, I don’t expect to be alone at night very often.  I often meet people with a similar hiking pace doing similar daily distances, and if compatible, I’ve hiked with people for as long as five weeks.  I’ve had more trouble getting away from people I didn’t like.  You may recall the character of Mary Ellen from A Walk in the Woods.  She talked incessantly about horoscopes, how your gear was all wrong, and made hideous noises clearing her eustachian tubes.  I met the real Mary Ellen (not her real name) in New Hampshire in 2000, and Bill Bryson was actually kind in his description of her.  I had settled into Hexacuba Shelter thinking I would have it to myself, when Mary Ellen arrived.  She first suggested that I move to the other side of the shelter since she preferred to be on the right hand side and then began her nonstop monologue of serial malapropisms punctuated by her signature snorts.  Bill Bryson and Katz put up with her for several days before ditching her.  I hiked prodigious miles the very next day after meeting her to accomplish the same feat, sneaking out before dawn to get a head start. 
Hiking alone and spending nights alone in the woods are the least of my worries on the Appalachian Trail.",,View Entry,"Nov 03, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580355,"My answer to this question is, “Don’t!”  I’ll discuss common sense things I try to do to minimize the risk of injury, but I don’t always follow my advice.  Sometimes things just happen.   
I acknowledge that I assume a certain risk by hiking in the woods, especially alone.  What’s the worst that can happen?  Bluntly, I can die, die alone, die a painful death.  Okay, I accept that.  Naturally, that leads to a story.
I worked in a hospital, in respiratory therapy, right after college.  I was privileged to attend many deaths, both in the emergency room and on the medical floors.  The worst was a very good looking young man with a single gunshot wound to the temple.  We kept him ventilated while the neurosurgeon evaluated his trauma and decided that nothing could be done.  That one was difficult.  The treatment of COPD is much improved today, but back then dying from emphysema was a long drawn out process with repeated hospitalizations.  One patient in particular, whom we all called “Pops,” changed from being the kindest gentlest person to an avaricious soul, covetous of his oxygen supply.  Death was a blessing but not one that he embraced.  Then there was an old retired English Army officer who had served in the British Raj, when Britain occupied the Indian subcontinent.  He looked like Colonel Mustard from the game Clue and was dying from drug-resistant tuberculous.  He was confined to protective care and treating him meant double gowning, double gloving, and double masking, but the advantage was that supervisors rarely went into that ward.  I worked the evening shift and tried to schedule him last, to minimize the risk of carrying resistant germs to other patients.  It also meant that I was never rushed when I attended to him.  After his treatment, he would say Evening Prayer from the Anglican Book of Common Prayer.  I sometimes joined him in the responses and and the psalm.  One night, he asked me to stay after Vespers and asked me to hold his hand.  I did, and he simply turned to the wall and died in utter peace and dignity.  That would be my choice, rather than being mauled by a bear or falling off a cliff.  But however death comes, I am comfortable with the concept and unafraid of the physical part, because I’ve seen it often.  That’s been a tremendous blessing.  In this country, most people are insulated from death and it remains a dreadful mystery to them.  So if the fear of death is behind the question, “What if you get hurt?” get over it.  Perhaps volunteer in a hospice.  Make peace with mortality.  Saint Francis put it this way in his Canticle of the Sun, “Praise be You, my Lord, through our Sister Bodily Death, for whom no living man can escape.” 
The Appalachian Trail Conservancy estimates three to four million visitors to the Appalachian Trail annually, including thru-hikers, section hikers, weekenders, day hikers and simply folks who park at a scenic overlook along the Skyline Drive and walk ten feet along the Appalachian Trail before returning to their cars.  How many of them die?  According to Laurie Potteiger, Information Service Manager for ATC, also known as Trail Mom for her loving care of hikers, prospective hikers, and the merely curious, about three or four persons die on the Appalachian Trail each year.  About half of these die from heart attacks, perhaps one dies from heat stress or hypothermia, and there have been a few deaths from drowning, falling, lightning strike, one from a falling tree, and most tragically, an older woman who died of exposure in Maine in 2013 after becoming seriously lost.  How many deaths have been from bears and snakes?  None. Let’s deal with the common causes of hiker death, rare as they are, and how you might prevent them.
If you suffer a heart attack on the trail, you will probably die, even if you are hiking with a cardiologist or an EMT.  But cheer up.  Your odds of surviving the heart attack are not appreciably diminished for having gone into the woods. The American Heart Association reports that less than eight percent of people who suffer cardiac arrest outside of the hospital survive.  To minimize your risk of this very rare happening, visit with your doctor before starting your hike.  Find a doctor who understands that lugging a heavy backpack up and down mountains is quite strenuous.  Lose any excess weight, both from around your waist and in your pack.  Train in advance, preferably under similar circumstances.  Find a pace that lets you keep a conversation going.  Start going up the mountain at a pace that you can maintain until you summit.  
Heat stress, whether heat exhaustion or stroke, can sneak up on you.  Be aware of conditions, especially high temperatures and high humidity.  Stay hydrated, consider the use of electrolyte  sports drink powders and tablets, and above all, rest out of the sun.  Consider starting your hike early in the morning, taking a long siesta, and then hiking into the evening.  The combination of high heat and high humidity is not something you need bully your way through in order to stay on an artificial schedule.  Be flexible in your planning.
I know more about hypothermia having had two bouts of borderline hypothermia.  When planning what to bring on a hike, I now look at the average and record temperatures for a town near the section of trail I’ll be hiking, and adjust them downward 3.3 degrees for each 1,000 foot gain in elevation to the trail.  I carry layers that will give me comfort at the average low temperature and survivability at the adjusted record low. While hiking Vermont’s Long Trail in July 2002, I tented one night at the base of Worth Mountain, near Middlebury College’s Snow Bowl.  When I woke up, it was in the upper 40’s and gently raining.  I put my rain gear on over my shorts and wicking t-shirt and was quite comfortable going up the mountain.   On the ridge, the wind was howling on the open ski slopes, sucking the heat from my body.  I took a break when I got to Boyce Shelter, sitting on the front edge out of the rain, and had a snack.  I was unable to recall how I had gotten there, typical of the mental confusion in the early stages of hypothermia.  I forced myself to focus and saw on the map that an enclosed cabin, Skylight Lodge, was just under two miles away.  As soon as I got safely indoors, I fixed myself some hot soup and got into my sleeping bag.  My shivering warmed me up eventually.  I’ve since learned that I could have filled a water bottle with warm water and placed it in my arm pits or groin for faster warming.  And I should have worn my long underwear under the rain suit and prevented the entire mishap.
There are streams and rivers in Maine without bridges that need to be forded and techniques that minimize the risk, such as facing upstream, using hiking poles and maintaining three points of contact on the bottom.  If the water is too high for a safe crossing, wait for the level to fall.  Carry extra food so you don’t feel compelled to cross anyway.  Drowning is far worse than going hungry if it comes down to it.  
I described my first hike and sitting on the side of a mountain for four hours while lightening played on the ridge.  Most summer thunderstorms along the Appalachians move toward the northeast.  Be aware of storms in your area, and if you can hear thunder, avoid the ridges and open balds.  I lived in Florida for most of my life and have a healthy respect for lightning. Golfers were struck each year under blue sky by lightning angling out from the leading edge of a storm.  Carrying the equivalent of a lightning rod and lifting it to the sky doesn’t help.  
I thought I could quickly Google up a table comparing the relative risks of hiking to other sports and daily activities such as driving and showering and cut and paste it into this entry.  I couldn’t find one.  There are annual mortality reports ranking the causes of death including sports, but the figures are of little meaning without knowledge of the extent of participation.  Annual reports of causes of emergency room visits similarly lack context.   I did find a Spanish study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology in 2010 that followed about 14,000 sports participants over a six-year period and looked at the relative risks of injury requiring medical treatment.  The risks were adjusted for time spent in the activity, overall energy expenditure in other activities, body mass index (BMI), and age.  Higher risk activities included soccer and other team sports, skiing, and running. Lower risk activities included aerobics, gardening, walking, swimming, and yes, mountain hiking.  Mountain hiking increased the hazard ratio approximately 3% as compared to study participants who did not report hiking.  Participating in soccer increased the hazard ratio by 46%.
So all things considered, hiking is a relatively safe activity.  That being said, there was a survey of long distance hikers in 2013-2014.  Participants were asked, “Did you experience injury for more than a few days of aches and pains?”  Sixty-one percent of Appalachian Trail hikers responded affirmatively.  The most common ailments were blisters, joint and muscle soreness, and diarrhea.   
Blisters can be mostly avoided by well-fitted shoes and socks.  Beware of salespeople who want to teach you special lacing techniques or who insist that the shoe or boot will be perfect once it breaks in.  Especially with today’s lighter weight shoes and boots, they should be comfortable right out of the box.  Test them on a ramp, and when no one is looking, kick the wall to make sure that your toes don’t impact.  I have narrow, low volume (meaning flat) feet and find the best fit in European-brand shoes, like the Scarpa Rapid hiking shoes I’m now using, modified by replacing the factory insoles with green Superfeet.  A very popular brand of socks is Darned Tough, made in Vermont.  I feel like a traitor saying this, but my preference is FITS socks based in Tennessee.  Blisters are caused friction and can be exasperated by moisture.  For this reason, in warmer weather I avoid Gore-Tex and other waterproof breathable membranes that seem to hold moisture in the shoe.  I prefer a well-ventilated shoe that gets wet quickly and dries quickly from the heat of hiking.   It is rare for two hikers to agree about shoes and socks.  Keep looking.  Somewhere out there is the perfect fit and combination for you!  I start each day by applying a foot lubricant, like Glide, before pulling on my socks.  Others will use liner socks.  
Even with perfect shoes and socks, most hikers will occasionally have blisters.  There are remedies offered in every drug store, but few will adhere for long to sweaty feet unless you cover the remedy with either Leukotape (if you are not allergic to Latex like I am) or duct tape.  Googling “care of blisters while hiking” returns 996,000 results.  If the blister is open or I need to drain it to hike on, I apply antibiotic ointment under a bandage and then wrap duct tape around the toe or foot and check daily for any sign of infection.  On a longer hike, you can afford to take a day or two off if necessary to allow bad blisters to heal, but on a shorter hike with a rigid schedule, blisters can mean the end of the hike.  It’s happened to me, so now I focus on prevention.  
Related to foot blisters is chaffing, primarily between the legs and buttocks, and known inelegantly as monkey butt or crotch rot, caused by the combination of moisture and friction.  Wicking underwear and good personal hygiene, hard to achieve in the woods, are key to prevention.  I carry an extra pair of underwear so I can wash one out and let it dry on the back of my pack.  I wore a hiking kilt with nothing underneath for a couple of years, and it was quite cool and effective.  I never learned to sit properly in it, either keeping my knees together or pushing the fabric down between my legs, but it was really hiking the Chatooga River Trail, through the ravine where Deliverance was filmed, that cured me of it.  It is easy to laugh at such a personal problem like chaffing, until you suffer it.  My first bout was in 1999, hiking north from Harpers Ferry, West Virginia.  I walked bowlegged into a small town in Pennsylvania just north of the Mason Dixon Line.  A kindly pharmacist recognized the telltale gait and recommended a 1% Clotrimazole anti-fungal crème.  It worked overnight and I’ve carried it ever since.
There is a saying among hikers that joint and muscle pain that moves is good pain since it means there’s probably not an underlying trauma.  Unfortunately, that’s not always true.  Joint and muscle pain that moves is a symptom of Lyme Disease, which is only one of a number of tick borne diseases.  I’ve contracted Lyme Disease once, in Vermont, and it isn’t fun.  On this hike, I will be wearing clothing made of Permethrin-treated fibers, good for 70 washings, and will send my socks off for treatment as well.   On short hikes, I’ve depended on DEET, but I can’t see exposing myself to that for six-months.  I also carry a tick key, weighing 0.2 ounces, that is much easier to use than tweezers to remove the noxious beasts.  For years now, my daily routine has included a dynamic stretching protocol, Assisted Isolated Stretching developed by Aaron Mattes, as well some physical therapy exercises primarily to stretch my quadriceps.  Stretching is controversial, but it helps me, and I intend to continue the discipline on the trail.  More universal among hikers is taking an anti-inflammatory.  Ibuprofen is so common that it’s known as Vitamin I among hikers.  I personally prefer Naproxen (Aleve). 
Diarrhea has many causes, including simply the combination of intense exercise and relatively low-fiber diet, but the most talked about are Giardia (a protozoan) and Norovirus.  Some people are unaffected by Giardia; others manage to expel it in one explosive bout; others carry it asymptomatically spreading the wealth as it were; and others require medical intervention.  Treating drinking water either chemically, by ultraviolet light, or by filtration is effective, but there is some thinking that the Giardia is spread among hikers primarily by hand-to-hand contact and by sharing food, activities best avoided since hiker hygiene is less than ideal.  For the past few years, Norovirus, a highly contagious stomach virus, has been a problem in crowded shelters and hostels especially among northbound thru-hikers.  I hope to avoid it and them. 
The First Aid App by the American Red Cross is free and is an excellent resource to have for yourself or to assist others.  It is not wilderness-oriented but does cover many basic topics, including allergies, bleeding, burns, choking, shock, and stings.  Many of the treatment recommendations include calling 911, often a fine idea if there is cell phone reception.  Leaving a victim unattended is usually a bad idea, but if you must in order to find a cell phone signal, leave a note pinned to the victim noting what you think is going on, the time, and what direction you are going.  You might even consider taking a wilderness first aid course and becoming certified as a wilderness first responder.
As a solo-hiker, I make it a rule to stay on the main Appalachian Trail and to avoid alternative routes.  If I need more care than I can provide to myself, someone will be along before too long unless I’m hiking out of season.  I also make sure that Tom at home has my schedule, updated as I go along.  Do you remember Aron Ralston, who in 2003 had to amputate his own arm with a dull pocket knife after being trapped by a dislodged boulder?  He was celebrated as a hero, even though he violated the basic rule of informing someone of his hiking plans and staying on his planned route.  If you are going to walk off into the wilderness without letting anyone know, at least make sure you have a sharp knife.",,View Entry,"Nov 08, Wed",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580397,"Truth be told, I am doing very little to prepare for my thru-hike.  
There are many hikers, perhaps most, who insist that the only way to prepare for backpacking is by backpacking.  I am not one of them.  One of my early jobs was in the Department of Zoology at the University of Georgia, and among my responsibilities was procuring cadavers for the course in human anatomy.  Do you remember the character Jeremiah “Jerry” Cruncher in Charles Dickens’ A Tale of Two Cities?  He was a porter by day and a resurrection man by night, robbing bodies from graves for sale to medical schools and students.  I didn’t have to stoop to that, but I did make the rounds of the morgues at the Emory School of Medicine in Atlanta and the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta, if they had a surfeit of corpses donated to science, without greater specificity.  The corpses were embalmed and in body bags.  I never had any paperwork and drove an unmarked state van.  Even in winter, I had to drive with the windows down because of the smell of the formalin.  I often wondered how I would have explained myself if I had been stopped by the police.  I didn’t do the actual dissections, but I did have ample opportunity to observe the muscular and skeletal system and sometimes to assist in labeling the parts.  Never once did I find a muscle tagged, “for hiking only.”  
When I started backpacking, I was running about 30 miles a week and I thought that was sufficient exercise.  That was in Florida, and we lived at the top of a hill, 14 feet above sea level.  Especially with the pack weights in the 1990’s, I was unprepared for mountains and would literally count paces, stop and huff and puff,  and remind myself that mountains are of finite height.  After two hikes like that, I joined the YMCA, eventually finding a genius of a trainer, Won.  
At first, I would meet with Won before and after a long hike, so he could see how my body changed and modify my fitness routine.  Surprise — all of the muscles are involved.  The need for strong legs is obvious.  The core muscles and shoulders directly bear the burden of the pack.  Especially using hiking poles, the arms and particularly the triceps get a good workout.  Over time, we evolved a series of three routines that I continue to do in rotation, changing them up somewhat every three months or so.  Two days are devoted to strength training, emphasizing muscular endurance over the full range of motion.  The third day is an intense circuit, alternating two machines (70% of maximum weight, 20 repetitions) with two minutes of sprinting on an elliptical trainer.  I use 13 machines so that they pair up differently for the second go around.  It elevates my heart rate to 80% of my calculated maximum (220 - age).   I aim for six days a week at the Y and usually manage five.  Before walking down to the Y, I spend about 40 minutes at home with various physical therapy exercises for my knees, a Spri Band warmup for my shoulders, dynamic stretching and foam rolling.  Then many afternoons, we take a long walk.  Burlington, Vermont is a very pedestrian friendly city and most weeks we walk further than we drive.  Occasionally we will visit a nearby state park so I can hike up a real mountain, just to be sure that all of my parts are working.
I do this routine all year long for fitness, and as a bonus, it keeps me well-prepared for hiking so I don’t have to do anything special before a hike.  If anything, I back off a little in the week before a hike.  My objective is that when I return from a hike, all of my muscles, even my legs, are weaker, which is to say, I try to go out with more strength than I need.  The results have been excellent and, especially with my knee issues, I can truly say that I prefer hiking uphill now.  I find that I perspire amazingly less than before and sometimes feel like the mountain is carrying me up itself.  My annual Appalachian Trail hikes have become the carrot to keep me motivated for my fitness routine.
Especially now that I’m retired, I have time for this routine.  Do I think it is necessary for all backpackers?  Of course not.  I’ve seen many starting thru-hikers over the years, mostly northbounders.  Regardless of their initial preparation, the ones that make it to the Smokies are prepared, and by the time they reach Virginia, there is no difference.  Also, regardless of preparation, I believe in taking it easy the first two weeks, stopping when I think I could still hike another five miles.  The longer the planned hike, the shorter my initial distances.  
I keep a spreadsheet of my gear, with everything weighed to the tenth of an ounce, and reevaluate it when I return from a hike.  Very little of what I’ll be carrying for my thru-hike is new:  a replacement for a backpack that is worn out, permethrin-treated shirt and pants, replacement socks that I’ll send off to be treated, and a new external battery for my iPhone.  
Starting this journal and announcing my hike to my friends has been a part of my preparation.  It helps to make the hike seem like it will really happen.  Toward that end, last week I booked my flight to Washington, the train to Harpers Ferry, and my lodging there — all non-refundable — so now I have no choice.  And I ordered the few pieces of gear that I need.  It’s always fun to play with new gear!
In preparation for the thru-hike, I’ve also been losing the weight I gained during my first year of retirement. The last few pounds will be off by Thanksgiving.  I needed to do that anyway, and the coming hike has been great motivation.  
When I retired as a tax partner in a CPA firm that I helped found, I didn’t intend to ever practice again.  The opportunity arose for me to work part-time last tax season and I’ll be doing it again starting in February.  The local CPA firm I engaged to prepare my own return has been unable to locate permanent employees — the local unemployment rate is 2.9% — and I know their tax software thoroughly.  It helps them and it works out well for me to have some unplanned income.  Each day I work is equivalent to a couple of bed & breakfasts, a luxury I would otherwise have foregone.  
I’ve already gotten clearance from my doctor and will see him again in late August, midway through my hike.  We will be curious to see how my lipid panel and blood pressure change.  I’ve also scheduled a dental visit before the hike and mid-hike.   I also plan to see my chiropractor before leaving.  I’ve been fortunate in finding chiropractors both here and in Florida who don’t believe in stringing patients out.  They have both dealt efficiently with the reason for my visit and then taught me techniques to prevent a recurrence.  I’ll miss my foam roller on this hike.
I’ll also make it a point to review the Leave No Trace principles at www.LNT.org and also at http://appalachiantrail.org/home/explore-the-trail/leave-no-trace.   I really like the Don’t Be That Guy videos on ATC’s website!
There’s one more thing I’ll do about two weeks before leaving to start my hike.  Don’t laugh, but I trim my body hair before a hike.  I find it makes it much easier to stay cleaner and to spot those damned ticks.",,View Entry,"Nov 10, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580451,"The Appalachian Trail is marked with white 2” x 6” painted rectangles, known as white blazes, on trees, posts and occasionally rocks, but are not consistent enough to make AT hiking a follow-the-dots adventure.  Some navigation skill is still needed or is at least helpful.  Especially in federally-designated wilderness areas, blazes may be few and far between.  
Trail blazing has a long history.  Native Americans sometimes bent sapling hardwood trees in distinctive ways to mark paths and possibly to convey information.  The Appalachian Trail is not an old Indian path, but the AT occasionally follows indigenous trails, like the Abenaki carry trails between ponds in Maine.  Some Indian marker trees distinguished by horizontal runs of the trunk and distinctive knob are visible along the Appalachian Trail, although lightning, fire damage and falling trees pinning saplings can result in similar distortions.  There are some great examples of marker trees along the AT in Georgia and in the Smokies. 
Hunters and loggers would occasionally mark trails with cuts made by axe, definitely not a recommended Leave-No-Trace practice.  You will occasionally see one of the original Appalachian Trail metal markers, like the one pictured above, sometimes in the process of being “swallowed” by a tree as the bark grows over the marker.  Aside from paint blazes, there are also wooden signs along the AT, either on wooden posts or nailed to trees.  The signs sometimes announce the start of the maintenance section assigned to one of the 31 trail maintaining clubs or indicate side trails to shelters, springs, viewpoints, or intersecting trails.  Mileage figures on wooden signs are notoriously inaccurate, sometimes because of trail relocations, and cannot be relied upon, especially when you are tired at the end of day.  I truly appreciate the shelter signs that include an indication of trail north and trail south.  There are few things worse than starting the day by hiking in the wrong direction.  I try to make it a practice of saying to myself, “Left in,” or “Right in,” when I start down the shelter path to help me remember which way to turn in the morning.  It doesn’t always work and most hikers have stories of wasting hours hiking in the wrong direction with that horrible sense of deja vu.  Some people make it a habit.  I have met a hiker named Wrong Way.
Occasionally you will see two blazes, one over the other, meaning to pay attention.  The top blaze may be offset in the direction of a turn, but maintaining clubs can be eccentric in their blazing policies.  When I served on the board of the Appalachian Trail Conference, before its rebranding as the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, the board dealt with many maintenance-related issues.  I can recall one agonizing two-day discussion of blazing policy without any resolution.  It gave me a new appreciation for our Congressional representatives. 
Above tree line in New England, the trail may be marked by rock cairns, little rock pyramids.  It’s essential to follow the cairns to avoid crushing sensitive alpine plants and, in fog, to avoid walking off the mountain.  One of my favorite mountains is Baldpate in Maine that has two domed peaks joined by a lovely wooded glen.  I had dense fog on the east peak and had to wait at each cairn until the wind would clear some of the fog allowing me to see the next cairn.  
Hiking in dense fog can be challenging.  On a late October hike in Virginia, I spent much of the time was in dense fog, the kind sometimes called Afton Mountain fog, for the crossing of I-64 between Charlottesville and Waynesboro that is infamous for multi-car pileups.  I would pace off the distance to the furthest tree I could see and found visibility reduced to 10 feet at times.  The trail south of Afton Mountain crosses the Blue Ridge Parkway repeatedly.  I couldn’t see where the trail reentered the woods on the other side of the Parkway and got in the habit of walking directly across, making a scuff mark for reference, and exploring to the right and to the left until I found it.  There is an easier way today, using a cellphone GPS app like Guthook’s AT Guide.  I actually love hiking in dense fog.  There is a feeling of great intimacy and the color saturation is intense. 
There is a convention on the Appalachian Trail that if you are heading toward Maine, you are hiking trail north.  If you are walking toward Georgia, you are hiking trail south.  The AT often meanders and it isn’t uncommon to be heading trail north while the compass reads due south.  For a northbound hiker, east means to the right and is not a compass direction.  For a southbound hiker, east means to the left.  For example, The Thru-Hiker’s Companion has the following services listed at Sugar Run Gap south of Pearisburg, Virginia: R, P (E—0.5m H), which translates “Road, Parking and 1/2 mile to the right for northbounders and to the left for southbounders is a Hostel,” in this case Woodshole Hostel & Mountain B&B, one of my favorites.
Aside from white blazes to indicate the Appalachian Trail, blue blazes are used to mark side trails, such as shelter trails, bad weather trails or high water trails.  Hiker slang has created a rainbow of colors, like yellow-blazing for following a road instead of the trail, brown-blazing for hitchhiking the road instead of hiking, aqua-blazing for canoeing parallel to the trail (like paddling the Shenandoah River instead of hiking through Shenandoah National Park), and even pink blazing referring to a young male hiker following an attractive female hiker in high hopes, usually delusional.  There’s a blurred line between pink blazing and stalking.
I recommend carrying a compass even if you don’t carry maps.  It doesn’t have to be a fancy orienteering compass.  Any old thing will do.  One a hot, humid day hiking the Kittatinny Ridge in New Jersey that parallels the Delaware River, I realized that there was no trail in front of me.  I looked behind me and saw only endless low bush blueberry plants.  I had zoned out and wandered off the trail.  The first thing I did was to sit down and remind myself that I had everything I needed on my back.  I had hiked that section before and knew that Kittatinny Ridge is oriented north-south and is fairly narrow, so I was either to the east or the west of the AT.  I could see Rattlesnake Mountain to the north and remembered that the trail approaches it from the west, so I made the assumption that I was to the east of the trail.  With my compass, I walked due west and before long intersected a woods road running north-south.  I followed it to the north and soon intersected the AT on its approach to Rattlesnake Mountain.  If instead, I had reached the edge of the Ridge, I would have known that the trail was to the east.  The only embarrassing thing about my mishap was that an hour earlier I had passed a group of hikers and now I was coming up behind them again and had to fess up.  Today, I would have simply looked at Guthook, but it’s nice not to be totally reliant on electronics.
Aside from carrying a compass and having the Guthook app on my iPhone, I also carry a PDF version of the Thru-Hikers’ Companion, and in paper, I carry the Appalachian Trail Data Book, a lightweight table of distances between shelters, campsites, springs, road crossings and other features.  I want something in case I break or lose my iPhone or the battery is dead.  It’s compiled annually by a really cool guy, Daniel Chazin.  The Companion and Data Book, along with maps, are available at the Ultimate Appalachian Trail Store run by ATC:  http://appalachiantrail.org/home/shop.  Another very popular guide is the A.T. Guide published annually by David “AWOL” Miller.  It condenses an incredible amount of information into very little space but is too compact for my eyes.  Both the Companion and the A.T. Guide, and increasingly Guthook, contain information on town services.  With the large increase in the number of AT hikers, there are more and more businesses oriented toward them.  The Appalachian Trail Conservancy now recognizes Appalachian Trail Communities that meet certain criteria.  The economic benefit of welcoming hikers is broadly recognized.   
When I started hiking the AT, I focused almost solely on my feet.  I never had a sense of how the trail related to the land except by referring to a map.  This isn’t something I’ve tried to do, but I find that increasingly, even on a day hike in new terrain, I assemble a topographic map in my head and take pleasure in understanding how the trail is laid out.  I’ve started instinctively being aware of the sun angle and the moon.  It’s a strange feeling, but lately I’ve felt oriented wherever I hike, as though I’ve tapped into a navigation sense that we all have but have lost through city living and driving.  It won’t stop me from getting lost on this thru-hike and telling you about it.  I promise.",,View Entry,"Nov 12, Sun",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580534,"Once upon a time, not very long ago, if you didn’t have a local outfitter, mail order catalogues were the primary way you found out what gear was available.  You placed your order either using the order form and envelope included in the catalogue or by phoning them on their toll-free line, considered innovative at the time.  The current L.L. Bean catalogue still contains a vestigial order form and envelope, but most catalogues exist primarily to tempt you into e-commerce or into a bricks-and-mortar store.  When I starting buying gear for my first solo AT hike in 1994, there was no outfitter in Sarasota, Florida where I was living, and the one in Tampa was pretty basic.  I didn’t know about Bill Jackson’s in Pinellas Park or Travel Country in Altamonte Springs, both full-service outfitters.  Without the internet, how would I have known about them?  I ordered my “Big Three” items — backpack, tent, and sleeping bag — through the Tampa outfitter, but for the rest, I depended on Campmor in New Jersey.  I phoned them and requested a catalog, and I went through it like a kid at Christmas looking at the Toys “R” Us catalog.  Then I phoned to place my order.
I was a salesperson’s dream, filled with enthusiasm and ignorant as hell.   It’s a good thing I had purchased a true expedition backpack, the Gregory Robson with a capacity of 95 liters, because I needed the space for all of the useless stuff I ordered.  Needless to say, the salesperson chatted me up a good bit.  Especially with the potential of a large sale, creating the illusion of personal service and connection is good selling technique.  At one point, he asked me where I would be hiking.  I said, “The Appalachian Trail, in the South.”  Being a good New Jerseyite whose idea of the South was formed by Deliverance, To Kill a Mockingbird, and possibly Flannery O’Connor,  he exclaimed, “That’s so dangerous!  Will be you carrying protection?”  I had no idea what he meant and answered, “Do you mean condoms?”
At least a condom might be useful in an emergency to hold water.  But whatever would I do with a gun, especially a gun large enough to offer protection against a marauding bear or a drug-crazed mountain man intent on doing me ill? I shot a BB gun once, but that is the limit of my experience with firearms.  Even if I were not averse to guns and other things that make loud noises, I still wouldn’t carry a gun because it would fail by gear test.  What’s that?  When I get home from a hike, I clean my gear.  I weigh my favorite snack, usually a Little Debbie Oatmeal Cake, and then I weigh each piece of gear, asking myself a few questions:


Was this gear essential to my life and safety?
Did I use it at all and was it needed?
How many Little Debbie equivalents does it weigh, and which would I have enjoyed more?


For me, a weapon fails this test.  There have been occasional murders on or near the Appalachian Trail.  The number most often cited is 11 since 1974, not all of them hikers.  Considering the millions of visitors to the Trail each year, the risk of being murdered is less than remote.  The chance of dying from a heart attack on the trail (about two deaths a year) is much greater.  On the other hand, if you believe that a gun is essential to your life and safety, then you are free to carry one, so long as you comply with applicable regulations.  This link to the National Park Service Appalachian Trail website might be helpful to you:  https://www.nps.gov/appa/learn/management/questions-and-answers.htm.  As a personal favor, please don’t let me know that you have one.  Knowing that you have a gun in your pocket does not make me glad to see you.
I have had several encounters with guns on the Appalachian Trail, usually responsible hunters during spring turkey gobbler season, using the AT to access hunting areas, and carrying their shotguns open.  I admit to palpitations when I awoke at Pickle Branch Shelter in Virginia to see a hunter standing over me with a shotgun, until my eyes focused enough to see that it was also open!  My pack cover is blaze orange, and I will use it during hunting seasons, even if it isn’t raining.  I will add a blaze orange hat during deer season in North Carolina and Georgia on the last sections of my hike.
One of the more foolish things I’ve ever done on the Appalachian Trail involved a man with a gun.  In May 1998, I hiked northbound from Harpers Ferry.  Maryland was very pleasant, but starting at the Mason Dixon Line, I endured 18 straight days of rain, cold rain, until I descended Mt. Minsi into Delaware Water Gap and the sun finally came out.  There were occasional severe thunderstorms and sometimes drizzle, but mostly a good soaking rain that just never seemed to end.  In Duncannon on the Susquehanna River, I briefly met the first northbound thru-hiker of the year who bought a few groceries and hiked on.  I waited until after lunch to leave, and on the climb up Peters Mountain, I was caught by another thunderstorm.   On the ridge line, the AT crosses a commuter highway, PA 225, on a pedestrian overpass now, but back then, it crossed at grade at the bend of a hairpin turn offering no visibility of oncoming traffic.  With the thunderstorm, I couldn’t hear traffic and was nearly hit, only adding to my dampened mood.  Peters Mountain Shelter is on a loop trail.  As I approached the rather large shelter, I saw two things.  One was the hiker I had met in Duncannon cowering in the far back corner of the shelter.  The other was a man standing out in the rain ranting and raving and waving a handgun around.  He was dressed in denim jeans and a cotton work shirt, not hiking garb. If I had not been so ill-tempered because of the rain and being nearly hit by a car, I might have done the prudent thing, and retreated down the shelter trail and continued on to the next shelter, abandoning the poor thru-hiker to his fate.  But I was majorly pissed and walked up to the crazy man, and somewhere deep within me found a voice of authority and said, “Put that thing away; you’re scaring my friend.”  I remember being surprised at my voice because it wasn’t my usual soft-spoken manner at all.  At any rate, the crazy man shut up, put his arms down and walked off into the rain.  We never saw him again, and I had a new best friend for the next several days.",,View Entry,"Nov 14, Tue",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580636,"Maybe it’s just part of aging, but I find the biggest variable in whether a day’s hike is a pleasure or drudgery is neither the elevation gain nor the rootiness, muddiness or rockiness of the trail but whether I had a good night’s sleep.  Good views and great weather are nice, but sound sleep is priceless.  I have hiked with people (yes, Bill, I mean you) who can fall asleep instantly anywhere and sleep through Richter-scale snoring, freight-train whistles, and severe thunderstorms.  How I envy them!  
There are over 250 shelters along the Appalachian Trail made for people like Bill.  The average distance between them is eight or nine miles, but they can be spaced as closely as 1.8 miles or as far apart as 18.2 miles (with an intervening campsite and town).  In practice there is seldom a shelter when you want one, meaning that you will either hike further than you would like or stop earlier.  Most of the shelters are crude wooden structures with an overhanging roof, three walls, and a floor raised off the ground.  Some are more elaborate and can be much larger, multi-level mansions, featuring solar showers, swinging porch furniture, and separate cooking pavilions.  One in Maryland even has potted geraniums and solar lights lining shelter-area trails.   A typical shelter will sleep six-to-ten hikers lying side-by-side like canned sardines.  Most shelters offer a convenient water source (treatment required), a fire ring, a privy (outhouse), tent sites, and increasingly, some sort of food storage system designed to deter bears.  None offer room service, maid service, or mini-bar.  It is strictly first-come, first-serve with no special preference given to thru-hikers.  The Appalachian Trail Conservancy is developing a voluntary registration system that will help hikers learn which shelters are apt to be crowded, hopefully encouraging hikers to stay at the lesser-used shelters and campsites. 
Shelters and surrounding tent sites play an important role in the management of the Appalachian Trail by concentrating overnight use, allowing most of the land surrounding the trail to remain relatively untrampled.  As a solo hiker, I seek shelters out for human companionship and for the convenience of a reliable water source and a privy.  But at the shelter, I prefer to tent because I find I sleep a lot better.  Shelters are often crowded, noisy and fetid, but can seem like five-star accommodations in the rain.  There used to be a saying that there was always room for one more in the shelter when it rained, but with the number of hikers today, that is simply not the case.  Every hiker should carry some sort of shelter, whether a tent, a hammock, a tarp, or, like Grandma Gatewood, a plastic shower curtain.  I also recommend earplugs.
Hikers are only visitors to the shelters.  The real residents are white-footed mice.   They will explore your pack at night, searching for food crumbs or the forgotten granola bar, and will occasionally run across your face.  Other animals that frequent shelters include red squirrels and porcupines in New England, and skunks, spiders, and eastern phoebes who like to nest on the beam above the shelter opening. Snakes are occasional visitors and very welcome, since they eat mice. One shelter in Vermont had a resident woodlands jumping mouse, a really cool creature I had never seen before.
A friend joined me in 1996 on a hike going north from Damascus, Virginia.  Glenda wanted a trail name and received it on her first morning.  I had gone behind the shelter to use the privy and was hardly seated when I heard a blood-curdling scream.  I ran back around front pulling up my shorts and saw Glenda jumping up and down, shaking her upside down pack, and screeching glass-shattering notes.  Overnight, a mouse had gotten into Glenda’s pack, shredded her toilet paper and built a nest.  A half dozen little pinkies were now wriggling on the shelter floor.  Momma Mouse bravely rescued each one, carrying them to the safety of an abandoned boot.  Glenda was thus christened Midwife.  An unanswered question is why anyone would abandon one boot.  Can you imagine an absent-minded hiker forgetting to put one boot on and after several miles of hiking thinking, “Dang, I forgot my boot, but it’s too far to go back”?
Unless you are totally insensitive to others, you will quickly master shelter etiquette.  The rules are pretty simple:

Don’t manspread, both literally if you are a man wearing a kilt, and figuratively in spreading your gear all over the shelter.  You’re entitled to a strip about 30” wide and, if you can find one, a peg or nail from which to hang your pack.  Hang your damp hiking clothes from your pack and don’t monopolize any clothes line.  Don’t set up your tent in the shelter.
Don’t wake up others.  If you come into the shelter area after “hiker midnight,” meaning after the sun is nearly set, be as quiet as you can.  Try not to shine your headlamp on others, and use red lights if that is an option for you.  The same rule applies to early risers.
Be polite.  If you want to smoke, ask if it would bother anyone.  If there are kids in the shelter, don’t smoke or swear.  Use earbuds to listen to music, and go outside to make phone calls.  Not everyone will appreciate your having sex in the shelter. 
Minimize food in the shelter.   You may be comfortable using your food bag as a pillow, but it may upset others.  Use any provided bear pole, cable, or bear box, hang your food or use a bear canister.  Try not to cook in the shelter, although this is very hard to avoid in the rain.
Don’t pee near the shelter.  Shelters smell bad enough without the added scent of urine.  Resist the urge to mark your presence with either urine or graffiti.  Carry out your trash, even uneaten food, and keep the fire ring clean.  It’s not for burning trash.

In addition to the campsites adjacent to shelters, there are other designated campsites and frequently less official ones, sometimes called stealth campsites.  Camping is permitted anywhere along the trail, except where it isn’t.  Camping is restricted to designated or signed sites in Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts.  It can be challenging to find a reasonably level place to set a tent, one reason why more and more hikers carry hammocks.
In the good old days, happily long past, hikers carried canvas tents that not only were very heavy but would leak in the rain if you touched the fabric.  Today’s tents are much lighter and more water resistant.  Weight and price follow an inverse relationship.  Consider the following one-person tents:

Eureka Midori Solo Tent $98, 4 lbs, coated polyester taffeta, free-standing
Lightheart Solo, $260, 1.8 lbs, silicone-coated nylon, uses hiking poles for support
Tarptent Notch, $285, 1.7 lbs, silicone-coated nylon, uses hiking poles for support
Zpacks Solplex Tent, $555, 1.1 lbs), Dyneema (Cuben Fiber), uses hiking poles for support

I use the Zpacks Solplex tent.  The weight listed above includes the 7”x13” stuff sack and eight titanium stakes.  I am quite happy with it, a good thing considering its cost.   A major advantage of Cuben Fiber, aside from its light weight, is that it doesn’t stretch and gains relatively little weight when wet.  Silicone-coated nylon (sylnylon) stretches especially when it is wet, and absorbs far more water.  Having to leave your tent in the rain to tighten guylines is never fun.
Hammock sleep systems, sometimes known as bear pinatas, include a hammock, tree-straps, over- and sometimes under-quilts, and a rainfly.  They are marvelously comfortable and require only two trees 8-12 feet apart, regardless of the underlying terrain.  I had a Speers Hammock, no longer made.  I stayed dry even in horrible storms.  While side sleeping is possible in a hammock, I found that I invariably ended up on my back.  When I sleep on my back, I snore and would wake myself up.  Sleeping above the ground is much cooler, literally, and I found two quilts and a sleeping bag necessary to stay warm.  The combined weight of the hammock system was much greater than my tent, and I didn’t sleep as well.  That being said, those who like them, like them a lot and regard us ground dwellers with disdain. 
I carry an full-length inflatable sleeping pad (Therm-A-Rest Neoair Xlite) that weighs 12 ounces.  To save weight, some hikers will carry a 3/4-length pad.  Others will insist on a self-inflating pad, objecting to the time it takes to blow up a sleeping pad.  Other than sitting around sharing old stories and new farts, what are they afraid of missing?  I carry a down sleeping bag in a waterproof roll-top bag.  I’ve always carried down, even on canoe trips, and have never had an issue with it getting wet.  Wet down is not only heavy but is also a poor insulator.   Others will insist upon synthetic insulation.  Synthetic fill holds warmth better than down when wet and will dry quicker.  Either way, a wet sleeping bag is miserable and best avoided.  Synthetic fill is less expensive, but a down sleeping bag, properly cared for, will last decades.  Synthetic sleeping bags are bulkier and heavier for the same temperature rating.  Lately, down quilts have become popular, but since I already have 20-degree and a 35-degree down mummy bags, I see no reason to change.  I must economize somewhere!  I plan to start with the 35-degree bag in late April, knowing that there may be a few cooler nights when I might choose to wear my down puffy jacket in the sleeping bag.  I’ll switch to my warmer bag for New Hampshire and Maine.  I’ll start the southern half of my hike with the 35-degree bag and probably switch to the 20-degree bag in early October.  My clothing roll-top stuff sack is lined with fleece on one side and becomes my pillow at night.  Stuffed with the down jacket, it is quite comfortable.  I usually wear silk-weight long-underwear as pajamas, both for the extra warmth and to keep the sleeping bag a little fresher.  
After all this talk about shelters, tents and sleeping bags, I need to add that my favorite place to sleep on the Appalachian Trail is off the trail, in either a hotel, bed & breakfast, or hostel.  About every five to seven days, I go into a nearby town primarily to buy groceries.  Food on the trail weighs between 1-1/2 and 2 pounds per day, which mounts up quickly.  I’ve seen thru-hikers start in Georgia with massive packs carrying 30 days or more of food, including five-pound jars of peanut butter and 42-ounce oatmeal canisters.  There’s no need to ever carry more than seven or eight days of food on the Appalachian Trail, even in the remotest part of Maine.  The trail goes through towns such as Hot Springs, North Carolina; Damascus, Virginia; and Hanover, New Hampshire; and it is relatively easy to hitch-hike into towns close to the trail.  Sometimes I quickly buy groceries, eat a restaurant or fast-food meal, and hike on, but for the most part since I have to be in town anyway, I’ll spend the night.  Town visits are leisurely affairs.  Other than buying groceries, doing laundry, showering, and charging electronics, the only required chore is eating, and such a chore is pleasure indeed.",,View Entry,"Nov 19, Sun",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580737,"Have you ever pondered our place in the world as Homo sapiens?  The psalmist has us created a little lower than the angels, and some would read Genesis as placing humans a bit higher than the animals.  If you are ever tempted to think of yourself as angelic, try pooping in the woods.  The experience of squatting over a small hole you’ve dug and depositing your waste will leave you humbled, never again to doubt your true nature.  
Twenty-five years ago, the Appalachian Trail shelters in Great Smoky Mountains National Park had not been renovated and did not have the nice moldering privies they do now.  The stone shelters originally built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930’s were dark and dank, with fencing across the front.  At night you would lock yourself and your food inside to protect against bears, who would occasionally come and look in at the safely caged humans.   On a very foggy morning in April 1995, I let myself out of the cage, found a nice hillside, dug a cathole with my trusty orange plastic spade, and squatted.  A herd of white-tailed deer came along, dividing around me, all the while softly bleating, “Look at this one; have you ever seen anything more ridiculous?”  In a posture like that, it is easy to say with St. Paul, “O wretched man that I am.”  My beastly nature was quite on display.
Being a beast, however, is no excuse to act like one.  Human urine in the absence of a urinary track infection is relatively free of bacteria and unlikely to cause infection in other persons, so very little care is needed.  Human feces, on the other hand, is chockfull of pathogens. Bacteria can include Vibrio cholerae (cholera), Clostridium difficile (enterocolitis), Shigella (dysentery), and Salmonella typhii (typhoid fever).  Viruses can include Hepatitis A an E (hepatitis), and Enteroviruses, Norovirus, and Rotavirus ( all causing gastroenteritis).  Protozoans can include Entameba histolytica (amoebiasis), Giardia (giardiasis), Cyrptosporidium (cryptosporidiosis) and Toxopasma gondii (toxoplasmosis).  And then there are the Helminths like tape worms and round worms.  Don’t worry; you won’t be quizzed in the morning, but I hope you will take the issue of backcountry sanitation seriously.  
I’ll start on a lighter note, a light yellow note, by bastardizing Shakespeare:  All the world’s a privy, and all the men and women merely pissers.   On the Appalachian Trail, that’s just the way it is.  For guys in particular, the work-a-day thought, “Oh, I need to pee, but I’ll finish this job first,” seldom occurs.  There is no waiting for the next Interstate rest area.  Whip it out and let ‘er rip.  It’s polite to look around first to check for privacy, but gratification is rarely delayed.  Leave-No-Trace protocol dictates peeing 200 feet from water sources, trails, campsites and shelters.  In practice, that just doesn’t happen.  At least avoid peeing near water sources and shelters.  Spread your urine around and try to avoid plants.  Animals, including deer, are attracted to the salt in urine and may defoliate a plant that has been sprayed. 
In many ways, long-distance hikers regress to the infantile, and that is certainly true with regard to adventure peeing.  You can piss at Chattahoochee Gap in Georgia, near the headwater of the Chattahoochee River and take pride in peeing on the city of Atlanta.  Or on Loft Mountain in Shenandoah National Park near the headwater of Ivy Creek that waters Charlottesville.  The Appalachian Trail straddles the North Carolina-Tennessee boundary through much of the Smokies, so you can stand in one state and pee into the other, the only decision being which state will enjoy your bounty.  If you hike the Long Trail in Vermont, you can have the pleasure of pissing across the international border into Canada.  Perhaps it is only guys who think like this, or perhaps only me.  
There are two primary options for pooping in the woods:  privies (outhouses) and catholes (dig and bury).  Another option not required (yet) on the Appalachian Trail is pack it out, using blue WAG (Waste Alleviation and Gelling) bags, homemade bags, or poop tubes.  The latter is a length of 4” diameter PVC pipe capped at one end and plugged at the other.  One note of caution if you use a poop tube: Burb it periodically to avoid having your bagged poop become a deadly projectile!
I was given a book, How to Die in the Outdoors: 100 Interesting Ways, by Buck Tilton.  I lost the book in a fire, but I’ve never forgotten a most cheerful entry on black widow spiders.  The female apparently has a penchant for spinning her web under the toilet seat in privies.  The most frequent victims are men whose privates dangle into the web.  The good news is that black widow venom will seldom kill a person; they will only wish that it would.  Since I am an early riser and frequently the first visitor to the privy in the morning, i’ve gotten in the habit of taking a short stick in with me, twirling it under the seat and dropping it in. This probably isn’t necessary since the very thought of this way of death is enough to make nearly any man shrivel, thus averting the problem. 
Privies come in two primary flavors: pit privies and composting toilets.  In both types, BYOTP- bring your own toilet paper.  It is only rarely provided.  A pit toilet is essentially a deep hole in the ground with a raised seat above it and usually, but not always, a structure of some kind around it for privacy.  Close the lid on the seat when you are finished using it.  Most privies have a ventilation pipe and closing the lid reduces odor in the privy.  The rule for pit toilets is pee in the woods and poop in the privy.
Composting and moldering toilets are raised off the ground and poop is deposited into a bin, along with a handful of duff (the partly decomposed leaves from the forest floor), sawdust, or bark.  Composting toilets require more maintenance but the decomposition is much more rapid and generally a lot more pleasant for the user.  Some moisture is needed for composting;  follow any signage, but if in doubt, pee in the woods.
Only poop and toilet paper should be deposited in privies.  Trash, tampons, and any uneaten food (a rarity among thru-hikers) should be carried out.  I assisted in digging out an old pit privy once and it was like an archeological dig, the saddest find being a decapitated baby doll.  
If you are regular by nature and frequent the shelters, you may only rarely have to dig a cathole.    Be aware, however, that the Tennessee Eastman Hiking & Canoeing Club, which maintains 133.7 miles in Tennessee between Spivey Gap and the Virginia state line, doesn’t provide privies at its shelters.  I find this to be a scandal and a shame.  Is it merely coincidence that this is the section of trail most frequently hit by Norovirus during thru-hiker season?  By the way, hand sanitizer is not effective against Norovirus and few hikers wash their hands regularly.  You really don’t want to shake hands with a hiker!  Fist or elbow bumps are much safer.
It is natural to seek a little privacy for your catholing activity, by going off trail and hiding over a ridgeline or behind a large tree.  Hikers have been known to have gotten lost after completing their business.  If you are out of sight of the trail, it’s a good idea to set your hiking stick down in the direction of return travel or even to take a compass bearing before leaving the trail.  If you do get lost, at least you will have the solace of having pooped.  Some thoughtless hikers avoid this problem by pooping directly onto the trail.  There is no mistaking the poop for bear scat, since bears generally don’t use toilet paper.  Please don’t let this be you.
A cathole should be six-to-eight inches deep and 200 feet from water, trail, and campsites.  Only poop and white, unscented toilet paper should be deposited.  To speed decomposition, add a little liquid (water or pee), add some duff, and stir with a small stick before burying what is sometimes called “poop soup.”  What a horrible thing to be writing on Thanksgiving Eve!
Digging a proper cathole is not as easy as it sounds.  Many hikers believe that they can kick one out with the heel of their boot or with their hiking pole.  Except in sand and loose soils, it can’t be done.  Similarly, the cheap plastic orange spade I used to carry won’t cut through roots.  Invest in a decent tool, like the titanium Big Dig (http://www.qiwiz.net/trowels.html) or the Deuce of Spades (http://www.thetentlab.com/Deuce/DeuceofSpadespage.html).
It takes some practice to squat over a small hole, hit your target, and avoid splattering your clothing and shoes.  Some find it easier to dig where they can face and grab a tree to take pressure off the quadriceps.  Most of the world squats when pooping.  It’s a skill worth developing.
Now, aren’t you sorry you asked this question?",,View Entry,"Nov 22, Wed",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580797,"The quick answer is that I don’t.  
I have occasionally met hikers who naturally repel dirt.  It doesn’t matter how long they’ve been out or if the trail is a river of mud, they magically stay clean, even under their fingernails and their hair.  I don’t think they are really human, perhaps angels doing penance.  As for me,  I am a dirt magnet, a mud boy. 
I was still in denial of my mud nature when I started hiking the Appalachian Trail.  I carried a large water bladder with a shower attachment that I would fill and hang from a tree (a couple of hundred feet from the water source, of course).  Dr. Bronner’s Peppermint Soap left me feeling astringent if not clean. After drying with a large pack towel (synthetic chamois) I would dress for dinner in my clean camp clothes.  I would wash out my hiking clothes in a gallon zip-lock bag with a bit of Dr. Bronner’s and hope that they would be dry by morning.  They never were.  Dirt was my enemy, and I did my best to defeat it, even at the cost of pulling on wet clothes in the morning.  
That routine lasted for my first Appalachian Trail hike in June 1994.  It was warm most days and I was alone a good bit of the time, so privacy was not an issue.  The second year, going across the Smokies, was cold, with ice and snow even in late April, and the shelters were crowded.  The last thing I wanted to do was to bathe.   I found that I wasn’t dirtier or smellier than anyone else, angels excepted.  After a while, dirt reaches dynamic equilibrium, with new dirt replacing old dirt, but the standing crop remaining roughly constant. 
My habit now is to take a bandana bath at the end of the hiking day.  If there is a stream close to the shelter, I go downstream from where people gather water, sit on a rock and wipe myself down, before changing into light running shorts and a synthetic t-shirt, or for formal occasions, black silk-weight long underwear.   Otherwise, I fill my cook pot with a cup or two of water and at least move the dirt around on my body.  If I stop early and the sun is shining, I may rinse out my undershorts and hiking clothes and air my sleeping bag.  I have a two-ounce bottle of Dr. Bronner’s Lavender Soap in my kit now, but it gets very little use and will probably last the entire thru-hike.  My pack towel measures 6”x8”, and I use it mostly to rub through my hair in the morning, to remove some of the oils.  I remain fastidious in my dental care, brushing thoroughly twice a day and flossing at night.  If you are wondering what to do with toothpaste, the Leave-No-Trace recommendation is to dilute it with some water in your mouth and spray it around, not on foliage, the magic 200 feet from the shelter.  I also carry a nail clipper large enough to deal with the toenails that survive the first month of hiking.  
I don’t use deodorant in the woods; very few hikers do.  It’s said (meaning that I have no idea if it’s true) that deodorants and soaps attract wildlife and mosquitoes.  The permethrin-treated clothing I bought for this thru-hike contains silver nanoparticles claimed to be antimicrobial.  Perhaps it will work.  I’ve found that merino wool never gets terribly smelly, even without high technology.   It’s strange, I really don’t notice my odor or the odor of most my fellow hikers when I’m on a long hike.  That isn’t to say that hikers don’t smell.  If I forget to clean my gear for a couple of days after getting home, opening the pack is an intense refresher course in hiker stench.  But I don’t notice it on the trail, that is, until I approach a trailhead and encounter day hikers.  First, I notice their clothing, the dazzling whites and brilliant colors.  Then I scent their deodorants, colognes, hairspray, and most of all, perfumed soap.  It reeks to me.  Then I see their noses twitching from my odor, and in that instant, I smell myself.  It is a moment of cosmic validation.",,View Entry,"Nov 26, Sun",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580822,"The countdown proceeds, and in spite of myself and my years of experience the excitement is building.  I find myself having thoughts like, “I can’t wait until next Thanksgiving, when I’ll still have my hiker appetite! There won’t be any leftovers.” 
My flight to Washington National and train to Harpers Ferry are booked, and I’ve reserved lodging in Harpers Ferry for the Flip-Flop Festival.   All reservations are non-refundable, which is as close to commitment as a retired CPA can get.  The few pieces of replacement gear I ordered have come.  I am most impressed with the fit of the ExOfficio Bugsaway clothing.  I expected the usual baggy, shapeless trail clothes, but they actually look and fit quite nicely, almost too stylish for a lowly hiker.  I received my FITS socks and sent them off to Insect Shield for permethrin treatment.  They came back silkscreened with the Insect Shield logo and, in very small print, a list of the bugs they should repel.  I just hope the ticks can read.  The 2018 Appalachian Trail DataBook ought to be published soon, and the PDF download of the 2018 Thru-Hiker’s Companion should soon be available as well from the Appalachian Long Distance Hikers Association.  One of the advantages of membership in ALDHA is a free download of The Companion.   
A cold front passed through this morning, dropping about an inch of snow on Burlington.  That’s all it takes to make us feel like we are living in a snowglobe.  Cold weather is still a novelty to us.  I love bundling up before walking down to the YMCA.  It’s only right at freezing, but with the windchill of 21, it’s scarf weather.  I never even owned a scarf before moving here!  A sure sign of winter is that hundreds of crows, a true murder of crows, fly into the city at twilight to roost in the trees below us.  At sunrise, they fly out in mass to the composting plant about a mile from here, making for a very Hitchcockian dayspring.",,View Entry,"Nov 27, Mon",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580885,"Leaving Harpers Ferry, I expect my pack to weigh 26 pounds, including 4 days of food and 1-1/2 liters of water.  This is a considerable improvement over the 58 pounds I started with in 1994! 
It’s easy to obsess over pack weight and hikers can get very childish at times comparing gear and weights.  It is rather like two little boys comparing their wee wees and about as profound.  Hikers often speak in terms of “base weight” and the weight of their “big three.”  To me, base weight means the weight of my backpack and everything in it that I’m not going to consume.  I include my first aid kit in base weight, because I hope not to need it, but I exclude food, water, fuel, toilet paper, chapstick, sunscreen, bug spray, toothpaste and floss, soap and Aleve, along with the clothing I’ll be wearing and the hiking poles that I’ll carry.  Defined in this way, my base weight is 15 pounds.  The big three refers to the empty backpack, tent, and sleeping bag, a total weight of 5.6 pounds for me. 
My base weight of 15 pounds is actually 4 pounds more than I carried in 2006.  True ultralight aficionados, sometimes called gram weenies, will find this shocking and condemn me to the rack or to the pillory or sentence me to hike Pennsylvania repeatedly.  They will scoff that I now carry a bear canister weighing two pounds more than the bear bag and line it replaces.  They will guffaw that I need a heavier backpack to carry the canister, another wasted pound, and be incredulous that I carry a ground cloth (3.3 ounces), a small piece of closed cell foam as a seat (1.1 ounces) and camp shoes (7.4 ounces).  Adding pack weight is hiker blasphemy, and I am an unrepentant apostate.   I won’t attempt to justify myself, lest I lead you astray from the straight and narrow path to ultralight salvation, but I will try to explain the process I use in making my gear selections.  Read on at the peril of your backpacking soul!
Ideally an item of gear would weigh nothing, cost nothing, and perform every desired function perfectly without effort.  You would only need one such item, since it would do everything.  Cartoonist Al Capp envisioned such perfection, calling it a shmoo.  A shmoo looks like a mustached marshmallow, with legs but no arms, with eyes but neither nose nor ears.  What marvelous creatures!  They reproduce asexually, more fecund than bunny rabbits, requiring no sustenance other than air.  Shmoos are delicious to eat and like nothing better than to be eaten.  They will gladly fry themselves, tasting just like chicken; roast themselves, tasting like pork; broil themselves, tasting like steak; or bake themselves, tasting like catfish.  Raw, they taste like oysters on the half-shell.  Shmoos have no bones, so there is no waste.  They will gladly produce neatly packaged eggs, bottled milk, and butter.  Sliced thin, they are a perfect leather, and sliced thick, they are like lumber.  Why, the whiskers even make perfect toothpicks!   A single shmoo would be ideal in every way for backpacking.  You wouldn’t even have to carry one, since a shmoo can walk.  Unfortunately shmoos do not exist outside of the Li’l Abner comic strip, and neither does perfect backpacking gear.  Reconcile yourself to this: Whatever gear you buy costs too much, weighs too much, and there’s something out there or soon will be that works better.  And ultimately, it doesn’t matter, because backpacking isn’t about gear.  It’s about you.  You will quickly realize that the constraints, like weight and cost, often operate contrarily, making every gear decision a compromise.  You are searching for the optimal gear for you, not the shmoo of gear. 
I’ll start with a relatively simple topic that will quickly become complex.  Water treatment.  My first step is defining the problem, indeed, deciding if there is a problem. Is there risk in drinking untreated water along the Appalachian Trail?  When I started hiking in the Smokies in the early 1970’s, I never treated water.  I often didn’t even carry water, because it was so abundant.  I would simply dip my Sierra cup into a spring or stream or hold it against water dripping down rock and drink.  Cold, refreshing.  I never had a problem with diarrhea or other trail-related diseases.  Of course, there were far fewer hikers back then.  If I heard about water-borne pathogens at all, it was Giardia lamblia, a cute little protozoan with several whip-like flagella.  Back then, it was popularly called beaver fever.  There were relatively few beaver 50 years ago, and besides, as it turns out, it hasn’t been demonstrated that the type of Giardia carried by beaver causes giardiasis in humans.  To quote another great cartoonist of the period Walt Kelly, “We have met the enemy and he is us.”  In my entry on backcountry sanitation, “Where do you use the bathroom?” I list pathogens associated with human feces and related diseases.  Suffice it to say that there are many, and that not all hikers practice Leave-No-Trace, not to mention upstream sources of contamination.
Try Googling “frequency of water borne diseases on Appalachian Trail,” to get a feeling for whether this is really an issue at all.  Pay particular attention to articles linked to the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health.  In an unscientific survey of 2016 long-distance hikers on the AT, 4.8% of hikers reported contracting a waterborne illness.   An earlier study based on medical interviews of 334 long-distance AT hikers, found that 31% of the hikers failed to achieve their goals, the most common medical complaints being feet blisters (64%), diarrhea (56%), and acute joint pain (36%).  Obviously some of these hikers enjoyed more than one ailment.  A decreased risk of gastrointestinal illness was associated with better personal hygiene practices, cleaning cookware, and treating surface water.  I’ve concluded that there is an unquantified risk associated with drinking untreated water along the Appalachian Trail, primarily diarrhea associated with several microorganisms, that the risk is non-trivial, and that treating the water reduces the risk.  
How to deal with that risk?  The 2016 AT hiker survey found that 63% reported always treating their water, 2% never treating it, and 35% falling somewhere in-between.  Of those who treat, 80% employ a filter, 14% use liquid chemical treatment, 4% use UV light, and 2% choose tablets.  The frequency of treatment has increased over the years as filter and chemical options have become far more convenient to use.  I am pleased to see that the ceramic cartridge filter I used in 1994 is no longer manufactured.  It required superhuman pressure to generate even a trickle of clean water and clogged easily.  As a result, I seldom used it, but I did carry it as a magical talisman, and it worked well in that capacity.  In 1997, I switched to the Pur Hiker (now the Katadyn Hiker) weighing 11 ounces, yielding 1 liter/minute with minimal effort.  Hint:  Occasionally apply silicone lubricant to the piston o-ring!    When I became weight-obsessed, I switched to chemical treatment using Aquamira, a two-reagent system weighing 3 ounces.  It was simple to use.  Mix seven drops of each reagent in the provided bottle cap and wait five minutes to generate chlorine dioxide; add to a liter of untreated water; shake; wait 15-20 minutes; enjoy!  It has a slightly sharp aftertaste, like municipal water treated with chlorine, but is much less objectionable than iodine.  The required waiting can seem interminable if you are thirsty.
I currently use a Sawyer Squeeze filter, weighing 3.2 ounces including residual water.  I fill a 2-liter bladder (1.3 ounces) with untreated water and squeeze it through the filter.  I also carry a crushable HydraPak Speed Cup weighing 0.2 ounces to scoop up water into the bladder when necessary.  When I’m hiking into a dry camp, I can stop at a spring, filter 2 liters of water and carry the full “dirty” bladder into camp, assuring plenty of water for cooking and to start the next day’s hike.   I tried the lighter Sawyer Mini Filter (1 ounce less) and found it more prone to clogging.  I’m satisfied with the Sawyer Squeeze.  It’s light-weight, inexpensive at $40, effective, and easy to use.  I also carry 10 Katadyn Micropur tablets (0.2 ounces) in my repair kit as backup.
I’ve never tried UV treatment, like the SteriPEN.  The SteriPEN Ultra model weighs 5 ounces and costs $100.  The USB rechargeable batteries are said to treat up to 50 liters of clear water.  Cloudy or sediment-laden water requires prefiltration.  The hikers who carry the SteriPEN like it a lot.  It’s certainly easy to use: submerge the tip, press the button, stir once, and wait 90 seconds until the light goes off.  
This typifies my approach to gear in general:  Identify the problem; consider the range of solutions, including the do-nothing alternative; evaluate effectiveness, cost, weight, and ease of use; decide; repeat as necessary.  I have two large plastic bins of rejected gear to illustrate the last step.  You can see that I’m tempted by the SteriPEN.  If I were more adept at applying my own methodology, perhaps I wouldn’t have purchased 8 tents and 10 backpacks in the last 25 years.  You can see my current favorites in the GEAR side tab.
There’s a tradeoff between comfort in camp and comfort on the trail.  If you are constrained for time and need to stack up big mileage days, sacrificing camp luxuries is an obvious approach.  As for me, I’ve found that so long as my fully loaded backpack weighs under 30 pounds, it doesn’t make much difference.  I tried going without camp shoes.  Getting up at night to pee and having to put on wet hiking shoes was most unpleasant.   A light Cuben Fiber ground cloth is great under my sleeping pad in shelters and spread in a grassy clearing, makes a pleasant place for stretching or for a nap.  As I lose weight on the trail, I find that I really appreciate a small piece of closed-cell foam to use as a seat.  I also use it as a kneeling pad by the door of my tent.  Why should hiking the Appalachian Trail be a death march of pain and deprivation? Two or three pounds of little things is all it takes to make me a happy hiker.",,View Entry,"Nov 30, Thu",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581054,"If you were to eavesdrop on long-distance hikers in an Appalachian Trail shelter in the evening, after people have scarfed down their ramen noodles, pasta, rice, freeze-dried dinner, or instant mashed potatoes, but before the twilight has faded to hiker midnight when all that you would hear would be snores, grunts and the occasional fart, the conversation will invariably turn to food.  Do you recall the lyrics of Food, Glorious Food, from Oliver?  It could be the hiker anthem:

      Is it worth the waiting for?
      If we live for eighty four
      All we ever get is gruel!
      Every day we say our prayer --
      Will they change the bill of fare?
      Still we get the same old gruel!
      There's not a crust, not a crumb can we find,
      Can we beg, can we borrow, or cadge,
      But there's nothing to stop us from getting a thrill
      When we all close our eyes and imagine
      Food, glorious food!

My dreams on the trail are filled with food, not the beer and pizza of the illustration, but a fresh green salad, an off-the-menu sushi roll made especially for me by Bob at Utamaro in Sarasota, a luscious peach, buttermilk fried chicken, a fluffy cathead biscuit dripping with butter and honey, a Willamette Valley Pinot Noir . . .   You get the idea, and by now, probably have culinary visions of your own dancing in your head.  We lust for, we covet that which we do not have, and for a long-distance hiker, that means food, both in quantity and quality. Sometimes as I’m hiking along, I’ll fantasize about coming upon a picnic with all of these things and more, and being invited to join in the feast.  Surely some kindly soul will be at the next trailhead to offer me a hot breakfast sandwich and a cup of real coffee.  Those things rarely happen, and never when I’m expecting them.  
It’s usually not until sometime during the second week, after my hiker appetite kicks in, that the dreams and visions begin.  I call it The Hunger, always capitalized, a real living being, looming and hulking over me.  The Hunger is not easily propitiated and never for long.
Why is this?  The Mayo Clinic has a handy chart of calories burned during various exercises at http://diet.mayoclinic.org/diet/move/fun-ways-to-burn-calories.   Interpolating for my weight, I burn 524 calories per hour of backpacking.  Even limiting my distances for the first couple of weeks, I still burn 3,000 calories hiking, plus my basal metabolic rate of 1,468 calories, for roughly 4,500 calories per day.  Initially, my appetite is suppressed and I can’t eat more than about 3,000 calories.   Accordingly, I start with a daily calorie deficit is about 1,500 calories.  It takes cutting 3,500 calories to lose a pound of fat (Mayo Clinic again), and my own experience is that I actually lose about 1/2 pound a day.  It doesn’t take long for me to fall below my ideal weight, at which point my body starts screaming, “Eat, eat!  Mangia, mangia!” and The Hunger materializes.
After a few weeks, when I’m up to hiking eight to ten hours a day, my calorie need is closer to 6,000 per day, yet my consumption rises only to about 4,000.  What do I actually eat?  I’m ashamed to admit that the following is a typical day’s diet:


Breakfast:  6 slices of pre-cooked bacon on a flour tortilla — 370 calories
Lunch: 4 Tbsp peanut butter and 15 pepperoni slices on a flour tortilla — 730 calories
Dinner: Knorrs noodle side with pouch of tuna in oil — 670 calories
Snacks: 1 C dried apricots, 1 C peanuts, 4 pieces jerky, 2 Little Debbie Oatmeal Cakes, 1 Snickers, 2 sticks Cheddar cheese — 2,523 calories


This totals 4,043 calories, including 205 grams of fat, 156 grams of protein, and 375 grams of carbohydrate.  The calories from fat contribute 46% of the total, which is fairly efficient, considering that a gram of fat generates 9 calories, while a gram of protein and carbohydrate each contributes only 4 calories.  Sounds pretty awful, doesn’t it?  Let’s compare it to a McDonald’s caloric equivalent — Three Big Macs, Three Fries, and Three Chocolate Shakes — a whopping 3,870 calories, 162 grams of fat, 120 grams of protein and 429 grams of carbohydrate.  The calories from fat in this belly-busting McDonalds meal is only 40%. 
There are many variations in my trail diet.  A favorite dinner item is half a bag of cheese & spinach tortellini (three portions), with a shaving of cheese and a sprinkling of olive oil.  Stove Top stuffing with a can of chicken actually tastes good on the trail, but nowhere else.  Teriyaki Rice with Spam is strangely edible.  One of my favorite breakfast items, French Toast Pop Tarts, appears to have been discontinued.  Bagels and pita, in addition to tortillas, keep well on the trail, but loaf breads are easily crushed.  In cooler weather, a tub of cream cheese lasts several days.  In general, the harder the cheese, the longer it will keep without refrigeration.  A pouch of tuna salad make for an exciting lunch.   I don’t care for many nutrition bars, but I make an exception for Lemon Zest Luna Bars.  Occasionally I buy freeze-dried dinners for variety, and there’s no limit to what I will carry out of town for that evening’s meal.  I also supplement my diet with certain edible plants, including dandelion greens, ramps, wood sorrel, and stinging nettle leaves (all as potherbs), and I enjoy snacking on the young shoots at the ends of greenbrier vines.  They taste like baby asparagus, and if you’ve ever been caught in a brier thicket, you’ll appreciate the feeling of taking revenge on a very thorny plant.  Wild strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and blueberries are special treats.  I personally avoid gathering wild mushrooms, even the ones without poisonous lookalikes.   
Food weighs about 1-3/4 to 2 pounds per day, stripped of unnecessary packaging.  Along with water, it’s the heaviest thing in my pack, but quite indispensable.  It’s rare for me to carry more than five days of food, which fits very nicely in my 750 cubic inch bear canister along with my cook set and toiletries.  My cook set weighs just shy of one pound, including a four-ounce gas canister with a screw-on stove and a piezo-electric lighter inside a 900-milliliter titanium pot and lid.  Especially with the increasing hiker and bear populations, carrying a bear canister seems to me to be the epitome of the sixth and seventh Leave-No-Trace principles:  Respect wildlife and be considerate of other visitors.  Except for one five-mile stretch in Georgia, bear canisters are not currently required on the Appalachian Trail, but bear-hiker interactions are becoming more common.  Many shelters now feature bear boxes, cabling systems, or bear poles, but it strikes me that the onus should be on the hiker and not the maintaining clubs.  Bears are very much like us — lazy, opportunistic, and creatures of habit  — and no food tastes better than someone else’s.  Please don’t become a food delivery service for bears!
I have tried going without a stove, but I am not happy without a hot meal at the end of a day.  After Labor Day in 1997, I hiked stoveless from Harpers Ferry south to Waynesboro, Virginia, to complete Virginia.  I took advantage of every wayside (like a drive-in) and resort in Shenandoah National Park, but I was still seriously hungry at the end of my hike.  I celebrated in Waynesboro by going to Scotto’s Italian Restaurant.  I lied and told the server that I had been eating nothing but peanut butter and chipmunks for two weeks and asked her to start bringing me food of her choice and not to stop until I did.  They were not very busy and she consulted with the kitchen.  Garlic bread, stuffed jalapeños, antipasto salad, and eggplant parmigiana with spaghetti quickly vanished down my gullet, helped along by beer and wine.  They finally defeated me with an excellent veal saltimbocca over linguini, but still brought me a little spumoni.  The entire staff came out, applauded me and presented me with the check — for $25!  I was in ecstatic agony walking back to the Quality Inn.  
The average weight loss for a male thru-hiker is 30 pounds.  With my daily calorie deficit, I would reach that in only two months and be nearing my high school graduation weight.  Finding a solution to weight loss is critical for me.  I plan to take advantage of every food opportunity near the trail, whether gas station/deli, restaurant, or hot dog stand, and getting into town at least weekly.  There are over 500 roads crossing the Appalachian Trail, and each leads somewhere.   Towns represent the chance to clean myself and my clothes, and to sleep in a real bed, but the true joy of visiting a town is to eat and eat and eat, like a hobbit:  first breakfast, second breakfast, elevenses, luncheon, afternoon tea, dinner and supper.  
There are more dining choices now in Gorham, New Hampshire, but in 2000, Friendly’s was the preferred option.  I had an early lunch (elevenses) of a Big Fisherman’s Platter, a huge mound of fried fish, shrimp, scallops and clams atop french fries, with a dab of cole slaw.  As I left the restaurant, a friend who had just hiked in hailed me from across the highway, “Have you had lunch yet?”  I answered, “Yes, but I can eat again,” and proceeded to order a second seafood platter.  Each was merely 1,560 calories.  Judicious use of town food serves to limit my weight loss.  
Most towns have either a grocery store, a general store, a gas station with a small grocery section, or some place where a hiker can find food to reprovision.  Sometimes the pickings are slim, especially if a hoard of hikers has recently passed through, but I’ve always found sufficient to get me to the next town.  I left the unincorporated town of Groseclose in Southwest Virginia with little more than a loaf of Wonder Bread, cans of Spam, Slim Jims, potato chips, and the most wonderful individually-wrapped Little Debbie Oatmeal Cakes, with three layers of cake and two of creme, the size of a large moon pie, and over 900 calories each!  To avoid this fate or because of dietary restrictions, hikers can mail themselves parcels, known as mail drops, via general delivery to the post office or to a hiker-friendly business like a motel, bed & breakfast or outfitter.  It’s polite to phone for permission first and then to patronize that business.  I prefer to risk shopping locally, since my tastes change from week to week.  Vegans, in particular, will often dehydrate their own food and mail it to themselves.
In reading over this entry, I find myself thoroughly disgusted with my trail diet.  I will try to do better on this hike, really, but I learned many years ago that carrying food that I think I ought to eat, like the pemmican bars on my first hike, does me no good unless I actually eat it.  Perhaps I will substitute Fritos for the Little Debbie Oatmeal Cakes.  Fritos make dandy fire starters, and the same weight of Fritos is 50 more calories!",,View Entry,"Dec 06, Wed",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581126,"This is the third of the fear questions that started with “Will you be hiking alone?” and continued with “Will you be carrying protection?”.  This question deals with fear of people and the next question with fear of animals.  Perhaps I should rephrase the latter, fear of other animals, because the there is an implicit understanding in the fear of people question that the woods are infested with hillbillies, hunters, and crazies, who are not quite fully human.  You know, not like us.  Not our kind of people.  Inbred.  Banjo-playing.  Dangerous.  Savages.  Lacking opportunity.  Unclean.  Altogether inferior.  Not really our neighbors.  
I would never actually respond this way except in imagined conversation.  And you, Dear Reader, would never think this way.  After all, it was I who put the question in your mouth, so these must really be my thoughts and fears.  And it is I who must confront them.
When I first started working as a CPA and having my own clients, I was very anxious about how I would deal with them.  I am shy, retiring, introverted, and have many symptoms of what today is called autistic spectrum disorder.  As a kid, I was just considered odd.  I was always happiest when I had one good friend, and I’m pretty much that way still.  I never learned to play with others, especially the rough-and-tumble games that most boys play.  I can recall standing at the edge of the playground in elementary school, wondering how the boys knew what to do, and asking myself why no one had ever taught me the rules.  There had to be rules, because that’s part of autism, believing that there are rules for everything.  I still avoid things like cocktail parties and especially Christmas parties with blinking lights and dueling carols.  I am happiest having a quiet drink at home with Tom or walking in the still woods.   So when I started getting clients, I was worried about how I would ever relate to them. 
It turned out to be a baseless fear, like most fears, and now that I’m retired I find I miss the time I spent with clients.  My great revelation was realizing that everyone is queer in their own way.   Building a relationship with clients meant discovering their queerness and allowing them to see mine.  I worked with many very wealthy clients and found a direct correlation between wealth and quirkiness.  Finding common ground defined by differences built a relationship of trust, which is the bedrock of any professional relationship.  As a tax CPA, I was asking my clients to strip naked in front of me, revealing all of their finances and hidden assets and liabilities, necessary if I was going to do my best work.  They had to trust me.  
And that is pretty much the attitude I’ve brought onto the trail with me.   My 1998 hike that saw 18 consecutive days of rain, started with drought from Harpers Ferry to the Maryland-Pennsylvania border.  The streams and springs were mostly dry.  About one-quarter mile south of Pen Mar Park on the Maryland side of the Mason-Dixon Line, I came upon a hiker setting up his tent in a small dry wash.  He asked if I had any extra water, and I offered him all that I had, since the park was so near.  He hadn’t realized that, and I waited while he packed up his gear, and we walked up the slight hill to the park.  The facilities hadn’t opened yet for the season, but a kind grounds worker gave us access to a utility room with water.  There were places to tent just north of the park, but I continued walking down a road.  My new friend asked where I was going, and I answered that I had read that there was a pizzeria nearby.  I actually had chosen the wrong road and after walking steeply downhill for far too long decided to ask for help.  There was a motorcycle repair shop across the street, so I started to go over there, but Even-More-Timid-Than-Me (I can’t recall his name) said that was dangerous.  I replied that I had no intention of walking back up the hill, especially without pizza, and asked the first biker I saw, a large gnarly tattooed gentleman, where the pizzeria was.  It wasn’t close, but when he heard our story, he said he had a van, drove us to the restaurant, waited while they made our pies, and drove us back up to the park.  Other experiences since then have convinced me that bikers and hikers have a natural affinity, in that we are both considered as renegades of a sort, on the fringes of society.  Timid joined me until the end of his section hike in Duncannon.
In the 2003, I hiked the Benton MacKaye Trail from the Ocoee River in Tennessee to Springer Mountain in Georgia.  The BMT has since been extended northeast to the Tennessee River and through Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  The available maps then were the equivalent of crayon lines on construction paper.  There were no marked water sources or designated campsites and only one shelter, constructed by a developer in the middle of a subdivision of second homes.  Much of the time, navigation was challenging since blazing is not permitted in federally-designated wilderness areas, except for the Appalachian Trail.  There were occasional low sign posts, but the signs were invariably missing, since bears like to scratch their backs on them.  On the second or third day, I was crossing Big Frog Mountain and came to a brush heap blocking the trail, meaning that the trail had been relocated.  To the left I saw a rock cairn and sure enough, there was a newly cut narrow trail switchbacking off the mountain.  I followed it and eventually came to a trail intersection with four other paths leading in different directions.  There was a sign post, but naturally, no sign.  I was literally off the map.  I had a feeling that the path to the right was the correct one, since it headed off in the direction of Flat Top Mountain, but hiking alone, that wasn’t a chance I wanted to take.  One of the trails followed a stream heading downstream so I chose that one.  The stream quickly became a larger creek and before too long came out at a U.S. Forest Service campground, closed for the season.  There was an unpaved forest road heading off in both directions.  I mentally tossed a coin and started walking.  Not ten minutes later, an old rusty Ford Fiesta that had once been orange came along and pulled up alongside of me.  The driver, a man about my age, looked not unlike Snuffy Smith, but with fewer teeth.  He asked me where I was trying to go, and I confessed that I didn’t know since I didn’t know where I was.  He said I looked thirsty and took me behind the car and opened the hatchback.  There was a cooler and I had visions of cold beer or even moonshine, but it was filled with cans of cold V-8 Juice.  There were also two gunny sacks of chestnuts that he said were wormy, and that his ungrateful kids wouldn’t eat them.  He carried me into Ducktown, Tennessee, where there was a motel.  (In the south, you carry people but you tote stuff.)  I was able to arrange a shuttle for the next morning to a trail intersection near Flat Top Mountain, where I should have camped the previous night.  As Snuffy had told me, there was an isolated grove of mature chestnut trees on that mountain that had thus far escaped the blight.  
So much for hillbillies and bikers. Folks is folks.  I’ve found myself confused on other hikes in the south and had to depend on the kindness of strangers, as Tennessee Williams would put it.  I’ve made it a point of showing that my hands were empty and simply asked for help.  It didn’t matter if they were drunk or sober.  Not being a threat and respectfully asking for help creates an obligation and establishes relationship.  
So to answer the question, no, I’m not afraid of hillbillies, hunters or crazy people who I might meet on the Appalachian Trail.  They are just friends I haven’t met yet.   That’s mostly worked out, but not everyone wants to be my friend.  There was the crazy gun-waving man in Pennsylvania.  And less dramatically, there was a time in Virginia.  I was setting up my tent and a gentleman who was staying in the shelter came over and made conversation.  At one point, he noticed my wedding band and asked how my wife felt about my being out hiking alone.  I responded that my husband was very supportive but that it wasn’t something he chose to do.  That prompted a tirade ending with, “I’m not going to spend the night with a f—ing faggot,” to which I responded with my best Bette Davis clipped speech, “Suit yourself.”  He packed up and hiked on.  Some people just don’t want to be friends.",,View Entry,"Dec 11, Mon",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581280,"Dorothy: Do – do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
     Tin Man: We might.
     Dorothy: Oh!
     Scarecrow: Animals that – that eat straw?
     Tin Man: Uh, some. But mostly lions and tigers and bears.

     Dorothy: Oh! Lions and tigers and bears. Oh my!
In Colonial America, especially in Puritan New England, there were two great fears:  Indians and the Devil.  The Wilderness was the natural habitat of the devil, and it was also where the Indians lived.  The two were obviously in league, along with their minions, the mountain lions, wolves, and bears.  There were no tigers.  The duty of the good Christian settlers was clear:  The woods must be chopped down and the Indians not vanquished through disease must be civilized, made aware of their sinfulness, and be baptized into the White Christ.  Where wilderness existed, a garden should be made.
Somehow growing up, I missed out on the lesson that the woods were evil and to be feared.  The first place I remember living was a Levittown-type suburb in Baltimore, Maryland.  The woods began a block away, and a path through the woods was the quickest way to school.  The woods were my safe place.  Whenever I was forced to go outside “to play,” the woods were where I went.  I thought the woods went on forever and was somehow related to Winnie the Pooh’s Hundred Acre Wood.   I searched diligently, but I never found Pooh Bear’s house.  I did find where the jack-in-the-pulpits and other wildflowers bloomed each spring, and without meaning to, where the poison ivy and oak grew most lushly.   The creatures of the woods were my friends, and I always felt bad when they ran from me.  We moved away when I was 11 years old to places without woods, but whenever I step foot into the forest that feeling of safety and homecoming returns.   
There are animals in the forest that can eat me or at least steal my food.  I know that, and perhaps I should be more afraid of them, but I’m not.  Mountain lions, to the extent that they exist in the Eastern United States, are rare.  A South Dakota mountain lion wandered more than 1,500 miles eastward only to be killed on a Connecticut highway in June 2011.  A remnant population remains in Florida.  Coming back from an overnight hike in Myakka River State Park near where I lived in Florida, I saw the unmistakable tracks of a panther in the sugar sand of an old rail bed. The rangers confirmed having seen a panther cross there before.  I admit that knowing that there was something in the park that could eat me sent a frisson up my spine.  
Black bears are found in every Appalachian Trail state, and their population is growing.  I have seen at least one in each of the trail states, except for West Virginia and Connecticut.  I always feel honored to see them.  On my first hike through Shenandoah National Park in 1997, I saw six bears.  I was hiking after Labor Day but before leaf season, a beautiful time in the park when there are relatively few visitors yet all of the park facilities are open.  On my first day in the park, I came over a rise and saw a sow and her two cubs frolicking on the trail, engaged in what looked like a game of tag.  I practice quiet walking and the wind was in my face, so I was able to observe them for some time.  When I eventually wanted to pass, I clicked my hiking sticks together, a distinctively human metallic sound.  Momma turned in my direction and scanned for me.  Black bears are nearsighted, but eventually she saw me and huffed, a warning for me to keep my distance.  At her direction, the cubs ran off the trail and hid themselves in the undergrowth.  When she was satisfied, she walked about 20 yards off the trail, turned toward me, and nodded her head, giving me permission to pass.  Many of the springs in the park were dry that season, and I had to go down to the ranger station in Simmons Gap for water.  While I was there, I met the park’s naturalist, on loan from the Fish and Wildlife Service, who wanted to know if I had seen any bears.  When I told him that I had seen six, he wanted details.  I retrieved my journal from my pack, and he seemed to know each of the bears I described.  When I mentioned seeing a large male feeding alongside the trail not far from Simmons Gap, he got very interested and asked me how large the boar was.  I thought about it and estimated 600 pounds.  He said that that was his estimate as well and it was the largest bear in the park.  He was curious how I came up with my estimate, so I explained that I had a rather large partner at work who we joked was twice the man I am.  I pictured him on all fours eating and the bear was twice as large, making him 600 pounds.  This brute didn’t bother huffing at me.  He simply looked at me, shrugged his shoulders, and resumed his feeding.  I didn’t need to be convinced to back down the trail and wait until he had finished and moved on.  The bears of Shenandoah show very little fear of people, but until recently, tended to ignore humans as nonthreatening and only vaguely interesting.  With the increasing population of hikers, bears have become more aggressive in seeking out our food.  Bear boxes, heavy metal boxes that require manual dexterity to open, have been placed at each of the park’s shelters (called huts for some reason).  I was once mock charged by a black bear in Great Smokies Mountain National Park.  When I didn’t drop my pack, he quickly lost interest.  Outside of the national parks, my most frequent bear sightings are of their rumps as they run from me.  
Some naturalists dispute this, but I’ve always felt that I could distinguish between male and female mature bears.  To me at least, the female has a more elongated snout, and the male has a flatter broader face.  The female seems a bit more timid, unless she has cubs.  As you might imagine, large hairy mammals that don’t bathe tend to stink, and I’ve often smelled bear before I’ve seen them.  It’s a musky, yeasty, and especially for the males, acrid odor, sharper than hiker stench.  Bears use the Appalachian Trail to get around in their territories and naturally poop on the trail. It doesn’t take long to become expert at dating their scat and knowing their diet, and also to recognize their distinctive scratch marks on trees, a high as they can reach to make themselves appear larger.  
The cubs are born while the sow is hibernating and stay with momma through the following winter.  When she is ready to breed again in late spring or early summer, the yearlings are on their own.  It’s a very dangerous time for the young bears.  If they have learned their lessons well, they will be fine, but it’s a time of high mortality.  The yearlings are most amusing, both fearful and intensely curious.  I surprised one on Bear Fence Mountain in Shenandoah National Park on another hike.  He remembered what momma had taught him and ran off and hid himself behind a bush, but then stuck his head out to watch this strange biped.  Then he remembered momma and ran behind the next bush, and again stuck his head out, repeating this cycle of fear and curiosity five times.  On another hike through SNP, I had tented above the shelter.  When I left my tent in the morning, I could smell bacon cooking below and stood there peeing, thinking, “Bacon…Bacon.”  I became aware of a small black shadow about 15 yards from me.  A yearling was standing there on two feet having the same delicious thought.  When he became aware of me, he ran off.  
There are gray wolves in Maine, but I’ve never seen one.  What I have seen and heard in many of the trail states are eastern coyotes, which are hybrids of wolves, coyotes and possibly dogs.   They move quite differently than dogs, almost gliding into invisibility.   I have never felt threatened by them, although I was surrounded by a pack when alone in late October a few years ago at Knot Maul Shelter in Southwest Virginia.  There was no moon that night.  I had gotten up to pee and put my headlamp on and went well behind the shelter.  When I came back in front of the shelter, my light caught the reflection of silver eyes about 18 inches off the ground.  I swept my head and found that I was ringed by coyotes, like a scene out of Jack London’s White Fang, only I didn’t have a campfire.  It was cold, so I got back into my sleeping bag.  I did put my hiking poles within reach, although I don’t know what good they would have done.  I suspect that the coyotes had come to the shelter in search of mice, which were quite abundant there, and instead found me.  I quickly fell back asleep.  
I’ve seen most of the mammals common along the Appalachian Trail, including moose, deer (lots of deer), red and gray foxes, bobcat, mink, river otters, pine marten, fisher, beaver, raccoon, opossum, porcupine, striped and spotted skunks,  gray, red and flying squirrels, various bats, cottontails, various mice, shrews, rats, voles, and chipmunks.  None have posed a threat!  Of course, there are birds aplenty, but only a peregrine falcon driving me away from Baker Peak in Vermont scared me.  
I’ve seen timber rattlesnakes and copperheads and many nonvenomous snakes.  Compared to the snakes in Florida that include mean-tempered pygmy rattlesnakes and water moccasins, diamondback rattlesnakes, coral snakes, and invasive Burmese pythons, the snakes of the Appalachian Trail are a well-mannered, nonthreatening group.  I’ve mentioned black widow spiders and their affinity for privies, and there seems to be an AT tradition of calling every brown spider in a shelter a Brown Recluse.  In fact, along the Appalachian Trail, only Georgia and parts of North Carolina and Tennessee are in its range.  I am not fond of spiders, another reason I prefer to tent.  Then there are the insects; particularly loathsome are black flies, deer flies, no-see-ums, and mosquitoes.  And, of course, vespids, notably yellow-jackets.  I often meditate as I walk alone, and it seems as though each time I reach a new understanding, I am stung by a yellow-jacket, a six-legged Zen koan to remind me how little progress I have made.  
So, which animal scares me the most on the Appalachian Trail?  Ticks.  I will be wearing permethrin-treated clothing for my hike.  I’ve had Lyme Disease and unfortunately, having it once does not confer immunity, not to mention the other tick-borne diseases found along the Appalachian Trail.  
There are other creatures along the Appalachian Trail seldom observed except perhaps as a fleeting image in peripheral vision.  I mean, of course, the fairies that dance under the mayapple leaves in Spring and the demons who live under southern streams and seek out hikers who sleep past sunrise.  And the wee folk, like the ones who live under the rocks in Mahoosuc Notch in southern Maine subsisting off of offerings dropped by careless hikers.  I’ve not seen them myself, but that doesn’t mean that they are any less real than Santa’s elves.
Oh, how I pity the poor elves!  Imagine their working conditions.  Santa keeps them enslaved at the North Pole.  Keebler locks them in trees and dunks them headfirst.  Sure, they are always pictured as jolly industrious creatures but is this so different from the nostalgic depiction of slave life — the sounds of gentle laughter and song wafting up to the master’s veranda?   Have they no rights?  Elves need to organize and join the Elf Liberation Front (ELF).   ELF will fight for equal rights for elves.  Not special rights; just the same rights enjoyed by human workers.  Of course, there are politicians who reflect back to the glories of slave times, when families were so strong, but do you think the law back then, or even now, recognizes elf marriages?  Some even deny the existence of elves.  They are God’s forgotten creatures.  So pity the elves.  If elves were six feet tall instead of being wee folk, we wouldn’t be having this discussion.  Stand proud to your full height, dear elves!  We stand with you.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581431,"Of course, there is marijuana use on the Appalachian Trail.  Why wouldn’t there be?  I haven’t found surveys of marijuana use on the AT, but I assume that it mirrors the United States population in this respect.  The Centers for Disease Control published a national survey on drug use and health covering the years 2000-2014, available at https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/ss/ss6511a1.htm.  Focusing on the 18-25 year old group, the 2014 rate of having used marijuana in the past year was 31.9%.  The percentage of daily or almost daily use in the past month for the same age group in 2014 was 8.6%.  There are individuals who hike stoned, something that amazes me, but most of the use that I’ve seen has come at the end of the hiking day.  In general, it creates no more of a problem than the 1950’s custom of coming home from work and enjoying a martini, a manhattan, or an old-fashioned before dinner.  
There is an etiquette surrounding marijuana use on the Appalachian Trail that pretty much respects the seventh Leave-No-Trace principle of being considerate to other visitors.  Like tobacco smokers, most marijuana smokers indulge outside of the shelters.  Before lighting up in a shelter, most will ask if anyone objects and avoid indulging in front of children.  Being generous souls, most marijuana users offer to share, but take no offense if you politely decline, which I personally do.  I won’t pretend that I never used weed, or never inhaled, but it has been decades.  I have mostly pleasant memories so I might be more tolerant than some of the resultant giggling and profound conversations that sound inane to the unstoned.  Tenting rather than staying in the shelters avoids most of the issue.
Marijuana is the preferred intoxicant on the Appalachian Trail.  It is very light weight, easily obtainable, and quite potent.   The Drug Enforcement Administration continues to classify marijuana as a Schedule I drug, along with heroin and LSD, so research into the health effects of marijuana, compared to tobacco and alcohol, is rarely conducted.  Recreational use of marijuana has been approved by two trail states, Maine and Massachusetts, but most of the Appalachian Trail is on federal land.  I’ve yet to see a bust on the Appalachian Trail, but users should be aware of applicable state and federal law.
Some hikers carry a flask of a preferred alcoholic beverage or even rarely a celebratory bottle of Champagne.  I have a very pleasant memory of being offered more than a wee dram of a boutique bourbon at Velvet Rocks Shelter, just 1.5 miles north of Hanover, New Hampshire, by a southbounder who would be reprovisioning the next day.  When I hiked the Long Trail in Vermont, I had a somewhat shaky start on the day I left the Inn at Long Trail after having discovered single-pot Irish whiskies the night before.   Strangely, craft beer is less expensive in Shenandoah National Park than Coca-Cola.  And I can truly recommend the Hendricks Martini at Elements in Front Royal, Virginia.  
I’ll end this topic by toasting Oscar Wilde with two of his own sayings:


I have the simplest of tastes.  I am always satisfied with the best.
Everything in moderation, including moderation.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581556,"My planning is complete and other than writing this journal, I’ve entered a torpid state, waiting for spring.  This is my second winter in Vermont and I am starting to understand why so many New Englanders escape to Florida for at least a brief respite.  There’s nearly a foot of snow on the ground.  It’s 2 degrees at the moment, which is some measure of comfort since tomorrow morning is forecast to be minus 5 degrees with a windchill of minus 24.   This is more than crisp or bracing.  It is wicked cold.
I force myself to get out of bed, bundle up and walk down to the Y, only because I know that if I don’t go first thing in the morning before I’m truly awake, I’ll invent loads of excuses for not going at all. It’s not unlike dealing with day-after-day of cold rain on the Appalachian Trail.  You just do it because that’s what you do, and once you’ve pulled on your cold clammy clothes from the previous day, you have to get moving to avoid hypothermia.  I feel great after I’ve gotten home from the Y and take a long warm shower, and I feel great after a rainy day’s hike when I’ve changed into my trail jammies (long underwear) and am all snug in billowing down.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581643,"The greatest magic of the Appalachian Trail is its very existence.  I've already written a little about how the trail came to be, from its conception by mystic forester Benton MacKaye, its rapid buildout under the cajoling whip of Myron Avery, the ceaseless efforts of now 31 maintaining clubs and more than 6,000 volunteers, and the cooperative management system binding together the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, the National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, agencies in the 14 trail states, the clubs and Appalachian Trail Communities.  It's a rare example of a public-private partnership that actually works.  I never left a board or committee meeting of ATC without amazement that it functions at all.  There are so many strong personalities and inherent conflicts in the missions of its partners.  And yet for over 80 years, this fragile footpath of changing route and length, seldom more than a couple of feet wide, has endured and even thrived.  
In July 2000, I met a retired colonel at one of the Appalachian Mountain Club huts in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.  He had started in snow in Georgia and was relentless in his quest of Katahdin in Maine.  He thrived on anger and had brought his own ready supply.  To anyone who would listen, and no one would for long, he decried the lack of a command structure on the Appalachian Trail.  He viewed the confused and conflicted cooperative management system of the Appalachian Trail as an affront to his sense of order and discipline.  The months and miles had only added to his disdain.  And yet, there he was, and there the trail was.  I have little doubt that he completed his journey and can easily imagine him speaking to veterans groups about how wonderful the Appalachian Trail could be if it were organized according to his precepts.  Magic had no place in his life.
You know that I love words and language, so bear with me a little.  Magic entered Late Middle English from the Old French magique, which in turn derived from Latin magica and Greek magik.  At this time of year, we remember the Three Magi.  The Oxford Dictionary defines magic as a noun meaning ""the power of apparently influencing events by using mysterious or supernatural forces, in the sense of a mysterious trick, an exceptional skill or talent, or a quality of being beautiful and delightful in a way that seems remote from daily life.""  It is this latter meaning that applies to magic on the Appalachian Trail.  
Most long-distance hikers on the Appalachian Trail view their life on the trail as very separate, even remote, from their ordinary existence, sometimes referred to as their real life.  For those of us who have hiked for many years, the distinction blurs, but there's still a sense that being on the trail is different, that it isn't Kansas, Florida or Vermont anymore. I haven't lived in Burlington long enough that looking out over the snow-shrouded city and across Lake Champlain doesn't amaze and delight me, but I'm sure at some point I will take it for granted.  I had gotten that way about Sarasota Bay.  On the other hand, each day when I'm on the Appalachian Trail, I see or experience something that leaves me with a renewed sense of awe, even a feeling of having been blessed.  Magic can be a majestic view, seeing or recognizing a showy orchid for the first time, or finally seeing a moose.  Magic can mean that when I am hurting and ready to give up, a friend hands me the bottle of beer that he's carefully carried out of town wrapped in his sleeping bag.  Magic can be as simple as a car doing a u-turn to pick me up and carry me into town.  Magic can be coming upon a volunteer who allows me help clear a water bar or to paint a blaze.  Magic can be comforting an inner-city youth who has just heard his first barred owl, perched right over his tent.
What do these instances have in common?  Whether the view, the orchid, the moose, the ride, the beer, the opportunity to paint a blaze or to comfort a frightened child, each was unexpected.  Each was an opportunity for grace.  In our regular lives, we become accustomed to saying no.  No to the phone call promising a free dream vacation.  No to the investment opportunity of a lifetime.  No to the panhandling alcoholic.  We control our volunteering to fit into our schedules and preferences.  We give to charities of our choosing.  On the other hand, hiking the Appalachian Trail is an opportunity to say yes, to give and to receive blessings.  That is magic.
Before I continue my descent into maudlinism, time out for some definitions.  There are several common terms associated with trail magic on the Appalachian Trail.  
A trail angel is someone who does trail magic without the expectation of compensation or reward.  
A hiker feed is an organized effort to provide food and/or beverage to hikers, usually thru-hikers.
To yogi is a marvelous verb meaning the art of getting people to give you what you need or want without asking directly for it.  It derives from Yogi the Bear, the Hanna-Barbera cartoon character who debuted in 1958.  It means neither stealing picnic baskets nor asking for them, but enticing people to offer them and whatever else you need. Yogi can also be used as a noun.
Trail magic is spontaneous and unexpected both on the part of the hiker and the trail angel.  To my purist nature, trail magic excludes many acts that are wonderfully well-intentioned and much-appreciated, but lacking in spontaneity.  For example, most of the springs along the trail in Pennsylvania were dry on my second hike through that state.  Local people would bring out gallon jugs of water and leave them at trailheads.  This was obviously a planned activity, and to a thirsty hiker, there could have been no greater gift.  But was it magic?  Did bells ring when these putative trail angels received their wings?   In 1997, I came across a car parked at a Virginia trailhead on a rainy day. The driver was a former thru-hiker who had filled his trunk with doughnuts, muffins, fruit, juice, and soda, and allowed me to sit in his clean car out the rain until I was sated.  He had obviously planned his generosity, but it was totally unexpected by me.  Was it magic or just an act of great kindness and generosity?  Especially in the south at the height of thru-hiker season, there are hikers feeds at many road crossings, complete with large pavilion tents, grills, ice chests, and chairs for hikers.  Sometimes they are sponsored by church groups, on one occasion included an evangelist with a burger in one hand and a Bible in the other.  That's rare.  Usually they are put on by former hikers or groups of local residents wanting nothing more than the good feeling that comes from helping, or in this case, feeding others. Word of a major feed spreads up and down the trail via cellphone and hikers will adjust their schedules accordingly.  Is this magic or a nuisance, contrary to the vaunted pride most hikers take in self-reliance?  I met a super nice lady in Virginia who each Memorial Day provides an ice cream social for hikers at a gap south of Waynesboro at considerable expense and inconvenience to herself.  Her heart is pure, but as a hiker, should I walk through the woods hoping for ice cream or a burger and feeling disappointed not to find them?  What about unattended ice chests left in the woods with sodas and snacks, or cribs of beer left cooling in a stream, both opportunities for serious littering?  Or even the jugs of water in a drought?  
It's a controversial topic for both hikers and trail managers, and there isn't an effective way to control it.  As a hiker, I could be noble and walk by the ice chests and feeds, but I don't.  Just the thought of a juicy burger, a piece of fruit, homemade cookies, or a cold drink on a hot day overcomes my scruples.  I'm joyful in my gluttony and express only gratitude, but somewhere in the back of my mind or deep in my heart, theres a niggling fear that my soul has suffered.  I confess; I repent; and gladly do it again at the next road crossing.  
Harold Allen, an early volunteer with both the Appalachian Trail Conference (now Conservancy) and the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club, was a key figure in creating Shenandoah National Park and in protecting the Blue Ridge.  Sometime in the 1930's he described the Appalachian Trail this way:   
      Remote for detachment,
      narrow for chosen company,
      winding for leisure,
      lonely for contemplation,
      the Trail beckons not merely north and south
      but upward to the body, mind and soul of man.
The proliferation of feeds and the well-intentioned kindnesses of so many, and indeed, the increasing number of hikers itself, risks the loss of that sense of remoteness.  You will recall one of the definitions of magic cited above, a quality of being beautiful and delightful in a way that seems remote from daily life.  When magic becomes ordinary and expected, it ceases to be magic at all.
Let's end this on a more cheerful note, with a discussion of yogiing, the art of enticing people to give you what you want.  In 1995 as I was nearing the north end of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, I saw an older couple sitting on a picnic blanket near the trail, and even from a distance, I could smell excellent coffee.  I don't bring coffee with me on the trail because I haven't found an instant coffee that I can tolerate, and I'm not willing to carry the paraphernalia to make real coffee.  To ask directly for a cup would have been begging and would violate the spirit of yogi.  Instead I engaged them in conversation and soon found out that they were scouting for a wildflower hike they would be leading the next day.  I was able to tell them where certain flowers could be found, and that earned me an invitation to sit down and join them not only in fresh coffee but also for homemade cookies.  We all went away happy.  It was my only successful yogi of a picnic, but not for a lack of trying.  I've walked by picnickers along the trail and also through picnic areas near the trail in Shenandoah National Park and along the Blue Ridge Parkway.  I've carried my pack and done my most pathetic impression of a starving hiker, even closing my eyes and groaning while blissfully inhaling the wonderful aroma of fried chicken.  I've tried commenting, ""Oh, what a lovely day for a picnic.""   Nothing has worked.  
I was more successful, without really trying, at Max Patch in 2005.  Max Patch is about 15 miles trail north of the Smokies and is the site of an old homestead and logging camp.  The mountaintop was cleared for grazing sheep and cattle.  Today Max Patch looks like a small grassy knoll, but is actually 4,629 feet in elevation and is ringed by mountains that include Mt. Mitchell (6.684') to the east and Mt. LeConte (6,594') in the Smokies to the southwest.  A gravel road leads to a parking area with an easy path up to the broad grassy summit.  It's a favorite picnic spot for students from nearby Mars Hill University, a private liberal arts college.  It is for me one of the most beautiful spots on the entire Appalachian Trail, and I've always made it a point to take a long rest there.  This time, I arrived about 12:30 on a warm sunny day with puffy white clouds and a gentle breeze. I spread my Tyvek groundcloth, propped up my pack with a hiking pole to signal that I was a hiker, and started eating a granola bar.  It was just late enough for picnickers to have realized that they had brought far too much food.  Soon, I was surrounded by offerings, including a bottle of wine, iced tea and juice, loaves of bread, cold cuts of every description, potato, pasta and green salads, fruit glorious fruit, pie and cake!  It was the reverse of the miracle of Jesus feeding the 5,000, far more than I could eat or carry, so I had to wait for other hikers to come along and share in the bounty.  I was simultaneously the grateful recipient of trail magic (with perhaps a little yogi thrown in) and a trail angel.",,View Entry,"Dec 28, Thu",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581815,"I saved this question for last, hoping that in writing answers to the other 19 questions, something would come to me.  I thought about George Mallory, who in June 1924 was possibly the first to reach the summit of Mt. Everest.  What is more certain is that he died on the mountain, his body finally recovered 75 years later.  When asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest, Mallory is said to have retorted, “Because it’s there.”  I thought of offering that as my answer to why I want to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail.  After all, in terms of elevation gain, hiking the Appalachian Trail is equivalent to climbing Everest 16 times.  In terms of any other comparison to Everest, however, it is a weenie roast.  Besides, I find it a most unsatisfactory answer.  There are many, many things that are there, and even here and there.  The Appalachian Trail is just one of them, so why have I chosen to do this?  
It is true that this will mark my 25th consecutive year of hiking the Appalachian Trail, so I could say that I am honoring my silver anniversary with a thru-hike.  I could say that I am celebrating my retirement and using the thru-hike to transition to, to what?  My golden years?  My surrender to self-obsolescence and incipient dementia?   I could say that this hike is a pilgrimage of sorts with a goal of finding myself or God or figuring out what I want to be when I grow up, except that I really don’t want to grow up at all.  Remember some of the words of Peter Pan’s manifesto?
     I won’t grow up, 
     I don’t want to go to school.
     Just learn to be a parrot,
     And recite a silly rule.
     If growing up means
     It would be beneath my dignity to climb a tree,
     I’ll never grow up, never grow up, never grow up.
     I won’t grow up,
     I don’t want to wear a tie.
     Or a serious expression
     In the middle of July.
     And if it means I must prepare
     To shoulder burdens with a worried air,
     I’ll never grow up, never grow up, never grow up.
All true, and I haven’t worn a tie since retirement.  But I could stay home and be irresponsible.  I don’t need to hike the Appalachian Trail. 
I could adopt a cause and hike for a fashionable disease or even in support of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, and badger friends and strangers to support my cause by pledging so many cents per mile that I hike.  I instinctively find this distasteful, although I haven’t fully framed my objections.  Perhaps it is the thought of using something sacred for another purpose, like using a eucharistic chalice to hold peppermint candies on an end table.  I have nothing against peppermint candies or curing diseases, fashionable or not, but this world is sufficiently profane that some things ought to be set aside as sacred, the Appalachian Trail being one of them.  
My negative reaction to hiking for a cause might be akin to “art for art’s sake,” that art should be valued in and of itself, and not for some didactic or moralistic purpose.  Yes, that’s getting closer my feelings.   Sure, knowing the provenance of the trail, the stated and perhaps covert intentions of Benton MacKaye, the techniques of trail construction, the social, natural and geological history of the trail, and the ins-and-outs of the cooperative management system, all add layers to the meaning of the trail.  Yet, at its core, the Appalachian Trail is fundamentally “A Footpath for Those who seek Fellowship with the Wilderness,” as it is phrased on the bronze plaque on Springer Mountain in Georgia.  So, via a brief detour into aesthetic philosophy, I’m approaching my reason for hiking the Appalachian Trail.  It isn’t to seek a mystical union with Wilderness, especially since true wilderness doesn’t have footpaths, but simply to be in fellowship with nature.  
Writing this journal has helped me to realize this. The word count of what I’ve written so far is approaching half the length of a short novel, so I’m glad something has come of it.  It is one of the magical (that word again) things about writing.  I’m often surprised at what comes out of my pen or keyboard and sometimes it gives me insight into myself.  I wrote some about my childhood and feeling safer in the woods than anyplace else.  It was my place of retreat and where I could feel as though I belonged, with the rocks, the trees, the wildflowers, the birds and other creatures.  I never felt that way on the playground with other children.  The Eastern deciduous forest is where I still feel most at home, and the Appalachian Trail runs through it.  
I gained some coping skills with age, but I never learned to throw a baseball or any other sort of ball.  I was the spastic boy sentenced to right field, where I would pray that the ball didn’t come in my direction, since I had no idea what to do with it, let alone the ability to catch it.  Even in backyard baseball, I only remember hitting the ball once when at bat, and having it go foul and break a window.  I discovered in high school that if I misbehaved in physical education, I would be sent to run laps, something I actually enjoyed, although I could never show it.  Anything was preferable to the humiliation of the rope climb, shot put, basketball, or any of the other myriad tortures.  I suspect my high school classmates in Norfolk, Virginia would have voted me the least likely to hike the Appalachian Trail or to do anything athletic and the most likely to trip over my own feet.  So hiking the trail is a way for me to thumb my nose at them, particularly satisfying since 2018 will be the 50th reunion of my high school graduation.  I won’t be attending.  So there’s another reason for me to thru-hike, to thumb my nose at classmates who probably don’t even remember me.  I hope all the guys are obese and bald.  Take that!
One of the attractions of New College in Sarasota, Florida (now part of the state university system, but then private and quite independent) was that its athletic program consisted of a few Frisbees, a Sunfish for the bay, a swimming pool and a tennis court.  Freed from the tyranny of mean little boys, I found that I enjoyed exercise.  I started taking long walks at night and during a year of research spent at the University of Georgia, my office mate was Dick Murlless, coauthor of the first Sierra Club Hiker’s Guide to the Smokies.  He was also instrumental to saving Jacks River and Little Cumberland Island in Georgia.  I’m indebted to him for getting me out of the laboratory and rekindling my love of the woods and helping me to realize that my passion was more about natural history and less about science.  Dick died quite young of cancer, and I never had a chance to thank him.  
In my last entry about trail magic, I wrote a little about how in our grown up lives, we learn to say no reflexively, to offers of great wealth and leisure, to panhandlers, and to charitable solicitations.  The Appalachian Trail is an opportunity for me to say yes, to give and to receive blessings, without being concerned about billable hours, about where I ought to be, and about what I ought to be doing.  This hike is way of saying yes to myself, that’s it’s okay that I preferred the woods to the playground.  It’s okay that I can’t hit a baseball or a golf ball, tolerate football on TV, or cope with the random chatter of a cocktail or Christmas party, because I can walk in the woods.  And that’s quite enough.  The Appalachian Trail is where I belong.",,View Entry,"Jan 02, Tue",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581905,"Back in October when I asked myself 20 common questions about the Appalachian Trail, I expected that answering them would take the entire six months until the start of my hike.  Oops.  I completed it in under three months.  So what do I do now?  I don’t feel right just putting the journal in dormancy for three months, especially since someone seems to be reading what I write.  Of course, I can’t really know that.  The page click meter has just passed 10,000, but that could be because thousands of people are stumbling into my journal and fleeing in panic, each leaving a single click in their wake.  (By the way, I am intentionally trying to use inclusive language to see what it feels like.  So far, I like it. Constructions like “his or her” are so awkward.  I haven’t moved to “They is” yet, but if I meet a non-binary hiker this year, I will.)  
Writing this journal is like giving a speech when there’s a bight light shining in your eyes, and you can’t see the audience to gauge their reaction.  Pacing becomes difficult when you can’t see faces but can only hear occasional laughter or snoring.  I offer my thanks to those of you who have signed my guestbook, and especially to those who have written nice things.  The feedback is encouraging.  
So I’ll use the remaining time before my hike to share stories from past hikes or at least stories inspired by past hikes.  They are more or less true, and I’ll try to flag those that are cut from whole cloth.  You see, I don’t listen to music, ebooks, or podcasts as I hike.  I certainly meditate more than I do when I’m not hiking.  I also talk to the trees and listen to the rocks, but sometimes the conversation seems one sided.  Occasionally I’ll meet a hiker going the other direction and for whatever reason be taken with them.  Then I can spend days inventing their backstory.  I also tend to have vivid dreams when I’m out for more than a week, and pondering those can lead to stories.  I haven’t had any out-and-out hallucinations while hiking, but then, how would I know?
My hope for this hike is for each day be a story.  I don’t know if that’s possible, and certainly each story day won’t have a neat beginning, middle, and end (and the hiker lived happily ever after).  Typing on an iPhone will assure lots of errors from my fat fingers and auto-correction.  I apologize in advance.  I should also mention that Gertrude Stein is one of my favorite writers, but I’ll try to avoid circular writing that takes a long time and goes nowhere.  This will not be the Trail Journal of Every Hiker, in the mold of Gertrude’s Everybody’s Autobiography.  I haven’t the hubris, or with respect to Alice, the chutzpah.",,View Entry,"Jan 06, Sat",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581945,"This story takes place in May 1997 in Central Virginia, near Roanoke, and the dialogue is verbatim, to the best that I can recollect.  I had fallen in with a slow thru-hiker I’ll call M.  (It’s my habit to use initials or made-up names unless I have permission.)  M was trying to drag his hike out so that his completion would coincide with the annual Gathering of the Appalachian Long Distance Hikers Association in October.  That suited me just fine, because I was dealing with blisters.  We had started the day at Catawba Mountain Shelter, about 18 miles trail south of Daleville.  After hiking 1.7 miles, we had breakfast on McAfee Knob, sitting back-to-back for support.  McAfee Knob is said to be the most photographed spot on the Appalachian Trail.  It’s a giant rock slab projecting over the Catawba Valley offering a 270-degree panoramic view.  On a clear mostly sunny day like this one was, it is breathtaking.  We took our time on the ridge walk to the other side of the valley and had lunch on Tinker Cliffs, looking back across toward McAfee Knob.  From there, the trail descends gradually to U.S. 220, near the I-81 Interchange, in Daleville, Virginia.   Back then, U.S. 220 was a two-lane highway featuring two motels, a Howard Johnsons on the north side and a Budget Inn on the south side, and a nearby Western Sizzlin’ Steakhouse.  It has built up considerably since 1997.  The highway has been four-laned with a turning lane, and just to the west is a major shopping plaza, including a Kroger’s, a good outfitter, two all-you-can-eat restaurants and Three Li’l Pigs BBQ.  The motel on the south side of U.S. 220 that was a Budget Inn is now an Howard Johnson Express and the old Howard Johnsons is a Super 8.  The Western Sizzlin’ has been transformed into a Pizza Hut, but back in 1997, it was the only place to eat unless you wanted to walk nearly a mile down to the interchange along a busy highway without sidewalks.  
M and I took a room at the Howard Johnsons, and before we even showered, we walked over to the Western Sizzlin’ featuring a giant salad bar.  We probably smelled quite ripe and didn’t complain when we were seated in Siberia, near the kitchen door and bathrooms, away from all the respectable diners.  Soon an equally undesirable couple with an infant and a toddler were seated in the adjacent booth.  The three- or four-year old girl stood up on her side of the booth and looked at us intently and finally spoke.  “Are you-all hikers?”
We answered that yes, we were.  This pleased the tyke immensely and you could have tied her grin to the top of her head in a bow.  
Then she asked, “And you carry everything you need on your backs?”
We again answered that yes, we did.  
Now the smile was gone and her lower lip started to tremble.  She was consternated beyond measure but finally asked, “How do you carry your car?”
Welcome to the U.S.A., where even a toddler knows that a car is one of life’s essentials. 
After supper, M and I showered, did laundry, and decided to take a zero day there, meaning a day off from hiking.  We slept in and the next morning walked down to the Shoney’s Restaurant at the interchange.  It was nearly 10:45 when we got there, and our server told us that they would be taking the breakfast buffet up soon, so we would have get whatever we wanted now.  When she came back with our coffees, we each had three or four heaping oval plates from the buffet.  She scolded us, that just because they would be taking up the buffet, was no reason for us to take more food than we could possibly eat.  We tried to look cowed, but when she came back to refill our coffees, our plates were empty.  She looked at us quizzically, and like the little girl the night before, asked, “Are you-all hikers?’’  She apologized and invited us to stay for the lunch buffet, which we did.  
I’ve stayed at the HoJo Express several times since then and other than the quite passable barbecue at Three Li’l Pigs, my visits have been unremarkable.  I’ve often wondered what became of the little girl who would be about 24 now.  Did she become or marry a Nascar driver, or perhaps take the veil in a cloistered order, never to sit in a  car again?  I’ll never know.",,View Entry,"Jan 07, Sun",0

I hiked most of Virginia in 1997, starting at the visitors’ center at Mount Rogers National Wildlife Recreation Area where I had ended my hike in 1996, hiking north to Waynesboro in May and June, and then after Labor Day, hiking south from Harpers Ferry, West Virginia back to Waynesboro.  On the flight up to Atlanta in May — in the South, flying nearly anywhere means changing planes in either Atlanta or Charlotte — I was seated next to the ex-wife of my faculty advisor from when I had been a student at New College.  She was into holistic medicine and noticed that I was massaging my knees.  She recommended various herbal remedies and I nodded politely.  Perhaps I should have paid more attention.  
From Atlanta, I flew to Tri-Cities Airport in Northeast Tennessee and was met by a shuttle driver I had arranged through Mount Rogers Outfitter in Damascus, Virginia.  The drive to the Visitors’ Center took about an hour and after filling my water bottles, I was actually hiking by noon.  I foolishly tried starting with a fifteen mile hike to Davis Path Shelter, since removed, but darkness overtook me and I tented alongside the trail.   I awoke the next day with my knees swollen to about the size of grapefruits and quite painful.  My hiking speed was reduced to under one mile-per-hour, and it took me all day to walk the 12 miles to Knot Maul Branch Shelter.  There were about six thru-hikers in the shelter.  After introductions, I said that I thought I would quit my hike because the pain was just too much.  There were some overnighters tented behind the shelter, and I could easily have yogied a ride somewhere.  One of the thru-hikers who I later knew as M suggested that I postpone deciding until the morning and mentioned that he had read of a medical clinic in the town of Bland, not too far away.  
I awoke early the next day to light sleet and decided to take M’s advice and try hiking on.  On the climb up Chestnut Ridge, the sleet turned to snow and I was glad for my rain suit.  It was May 15, a bit late for snow, but there it was.  I took a break in the old stone fire warden’s cabin on Chestnut Ridge, quite possibly the coldest shelter I’ve ever experienced.  The sun came out as I descended from the ridge, greatly improving my mood.  My knees were not hurting as much, perhaps because of the cold, and I stopped at Davis Farm Campsite after 16.6 miles.  This campsite is down a steep path to the west of the trail, and is the site of an old farm.  There’s room for two tents, and there’s reputed to a be a stream or a spring about 200 yards further along the path, but I never found it.  What I did find, however, is that this campsite overlooks Burke’s Garden, one of the most fertile valleys in Virginia, farmed mostly by the Amish.  It’s a nearly circular cove that formed when a limestone cavern collapsed and is sometimes called God’s Thumbprint.  The view was worth the dry campsite.  
The next day, I hiked about 15 miles to the trailhead on U.S. 52, and immediately got a ride to the Big Walker Motel in Bland, Virginia.  There was a medical clinic as M had said, and I phoned them.  They suggested that I shower before walking down.  The doctor was an internist from India.  I was sure that after seeing my badly swollen knees, she would suggest that I quit hiking and go home.  The portable X-ray machine had been there the day before and wouldn’t return for a week, but because both of my knees were swollen, she doubted that trauma was involved and diagnosed osteoarthritis, the first of many doctors who would do so.  She discussed treatment options, and I settled on prednisone, industrial strength naproxen, and codeine for the pain at night.  The doctor warned me about prednisone, the risk of avascular necrosis and potentially euphoria.  There was no pharmacy in Bland, the nearest being in Bastian, about seven miles away on the other side of I-77.  I didn’t know how I would get there.   The doctor kindly gave me a ride back up the hill to the motel since I was her last patient of the day.
The Big Walker Motel used to have a restaurant on site, and we had a round table of about eight hikers that night.  I mentioned my problem of needing to get to Bastian the next day.  The waitress overheard and volunteered that her father could take me the next morning, on his way to his job at a nearby prison.  Her father met me after breakfast the next morning, and carried me to the pharmacy in Bastian, refusing to accept anything but my thanks.  The prescriptions were filled immediately and I took my first pills with a little water offered by the pharmacist.  I had no idea where I was in relation to the trail, but as soon as I stepped out of the pharmacy, a blue senior citizens’ bus stopped and offered me a ride.  I wasn’t a senior citizen at the time, but the driver didn’t seem to mind.  I mentioned that I needed to find a grocery store, and he dropped me off at an old-fashioned general store, J. Fred’s.

Fred was behind the counter and volunteered that he could take me back to the trail when his help arrived at 11.  It was about 9 then, but knowing neither where I was nor where the trail was, I thought that was a fine offer.  Then he mentioned the kicker.  Fred was a Pentecostal preacher and I would have to listen to him preach for two hours.  He softened the threat by offering to feed me the whole time.  I responded Amen and Hallelujah, being careful to sound a long A and to pronounce the H.  I was grateful for the food (second breakfast and an early elevenses) and that the text of his sermon was neither Sodom and Gomorrah, Leviticus, Romans nor 1 Corinithians about the sinfulness of homosexuality.  That would have been more than I could have swallowed.  Apparently, aiding and abetting gluttony was not a sin for Fred, for he fed me quite well and I was able to find groceries on his shelves for the next section of my hike.  About 10:30, his fiery sermon had moved on to the topic of death and judgement and was progressing toward Heaven and Hell.  He mentioned that his wife had died during surgery.  I expressed my condolences, and at that moment the radio telephone (we were  really out in the country) rang.  Fred excused himself because it was his wife.  I was thinking Twilight Zone thoughts, but when Fred completed his call, he explained that his wife had died during surgery, floated up to the ceiling and seen the doctors trying to revive her, and then saw Jesus and her loved ones all dressed in white.  She was given a choice of staying in Heaven or returning to preach about life after death.  She chose the latter and was restored to life.  I was spared from learning more when Fred’s help arrived.  Hallelujah, indeed.  
For my lunch, Fred graciously fixed me an enormous sandwich on a bun exceeding seven inches in diameter, the whole thing weighing several pounds.  We loaded my backpack and the sandwich into his ancient Ford Galaxy and he drove me back to the trailhead on U.S. 52.  He insisted on praying over me before I could exit his car.  Fine and dandy.  Then he tried starting his car, but nothing happened.  He asked me join him in laying hands on the hood, but instead I flagged down the first car that passed.  They had jumper cables (the Lord will provide), and Fred was soon on his way and I was on mine.  Thanks to the Prednisone, I made it 11.9 miles to Jenny Knob Shelter.  The sandwich was eaten long before then.
After a good night’s Codeine-induced sleep, I was feeling pretty good the next day.  I stopped at Trent’s Grocery after only 6.5 miles, for an early lunch.  Several hikers, including M, were there and had phoned into Pearisburg and arranged a shuttle to town.  I joined them and spent the night at a hostel in an old barn behind Holy Family Catholic Church.  M and I arranged a shuttle back to Trent’s the next day with the hostel caretaker Bill Gautier, leaving our packs at the hostel, something hikers call slackpacking.  Our pack lids converted to fanny packs and we brought only the essentials that no hiker should be without (map & compass, water, rain gear, lighter, headlamp, whistle, knife, first aid kit, and of course, food).  It was nearly 27 miles and I had clearly given in to the Prednisone euphoria.  With still about 8 miles to go, it started to rain and I found that my rain jacket had popped out of my fanny pack somewhere along the way.  It was on the cold side, probably in the low 50’s, and I debated whether to stay at Doc’s Knob Shelter until it stopped or just to keep moving, trusting the exercise to keep me warm.  I chose the latter and was fine.
The next morning I was faced with the dilemma of either continuing my hike without rain gear or taking a zero day to hitch to the nearest outfitter in Blacksburg, about 24 miles away.  Before I could decide, Bill Gautier walked in holding my rain jacket in his outstretched hand.  Another hiker had found it and carried it into Woods Hole Hostel, about 10 miles from Pearisburg.  Tillie Wood, a true trail legend, had phoned Bill to see if anyone had lost one and he had retrieved it for me.  M and I continued hiking together until Waynesboro and remained friends for years.
Planning ahead is a bedrock principle of Leave-No-Trace, and it helps to have appropriate equipment and supplies, but don’t expect that your hike will proceed in accordance with your plan.  If nothing else, planning ahead provides you with the flexibility to respond to life as it happens.  The Trail will plan your hike for you, like it or not.",,View Entry,"Jan 10, Wed",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582124,"Peg Bracken (1918 - 2007) was an American humorist whose magnum opus was The I Hate to Cook Book published in 1960.  Her recipes read like trail cookery, fully utilizing prepared foods like condensed soups and powdered anything.  She would have loved such trail staples as instant mashed potatoes and Stovetop Stuffing and found ecstasy in Spam.  She peppered her recipes with wisdom, wit and honesty.  Referring to her cookbook, Peg wrote, “This book is for those of us who want to fold our big dishwater hands around a dry Martini instead of a wet flounder at the end of a long day.”  Thirty-five years ago she wrote an aphorism that could encapsulate our present political situation: “Life is so very simple when you have no facts to confuse you.”  Peg also wrote a book in 1973 about the joys and perils of traveling, providing me with the perfect springboard for this entry:  “It is far easier to find a traveling companion than to get rid of one.”  I’ll double-down with the wisdom of Gautama Buddha.  “It is better to be alone than to be with those who will hinder your progress.”
I don’t want to cast myself as a trail curmudgeon or misanthrope, a thru-hiking Linus van Pelt — “I love Mankind…It’s People I can’t stand” —  but I find it far preferable to walk alone than to have the wrong companion.  On the other hand, “A good companion shortens the longest road,” [Kurdish proverb] and “An agreeable companion on a journey is as good as a carriage” {Publilus Syrus 85-43 BC].  
Finding the right trail companion is a problem of long standing.  The trail is a different environment than every day life, and a good companion for life is not necessarily someone I would want to hike with.  The 18th century author of Pamela, Samuel Richardson, put it this way: “The companion of an evening, and the companion for life, require very different qualifications.”  I’m uncertain if Samuel was making reference to a night at the opera or a more amorous setting, but I’ll be quick to dismiss any notion that my perfect trail companion would double as a bedmate by quoting a most expert source, Barnhard Goetz, who achieved a certain notoriety in the 1980’s as the Subway Vigilante in New York City:  “If you like affection, then about one in three squirrels makes an excellent companion.”  
You should be very glad that I won’t have Google as a companion on the trail this year.
There are two basic approaches to finding a trail companion.  You can bring someone with you or you can find someone on the trail.  There are pitfalls to both approaches.  Bringing a friend on a hike is a good way to lose a friend.  I’ve heard that ax murderers can be charming on first meeting.  
Bring a friend
1996 was an excellent year for Barolo wine,  but a dreadful year to hike with friends. 
I had known Ernest (names and places have been changed) in the early 1970’s, and back then he was much more of an outdoors person than I was.  We visited a few times since and exchanged occasional letters, but I was really clueless about his life.  He asked to join me on my hike in 1996, and I foolishly agreed.  Actually, I wanted a companion on this section, going north from Hot Springs, North Carolina.  Jean Cashin, the legendary Trail Mom at Appalachian Trail Conference headquarters, had warned me that hikers were not always welcome in Unicoi and Carter Counties in Tennessee and advised against solo hiking there.   There had even been reports of fishhooks hung at eye level across the trail.  Roan Mountain and Unicoi County, Tennessee are now official Appalachian Trial Communities, and whatever unfriendliness there might have been is long forgotten, but at the time I was scared.  So I welcomed Ernie’s desire to join me on the trail.
I flew up to Chattanooga, near where Ernie lived, and we met at the baggage claim.  Even before my pack appeared, I realized that something wasn’t quite right with Ernie.  He had been tall and slender when I had known him in 1970, but now he was cadaverous, with dark sunken eyes and sallow complexion.  He wore a black sweatshirt with a raised hood in the style of the Grim Reaper.  Ernie had always been quiet, actually one of his better traits, but now he was like a monk under vows.  The silence was ponderous, words spoken only when absolutely necessary.  Ernie moved robotically, as though each motion had to be consciously directed or programmed.  Watching him dice an onion that evening was painful.  Oh my, I thought, this was going to be a very long hike, but I really couldn’t ditch a friend before we even started, could I?  [Note to readers:  You can and you should.]
After two very long days of visiting and one-sided conversation, we drove to Hot Springs, west of Asheville, where I had ended my hike the previous year. We spent the night at a bed & breakfast.  Ernie was afraid to use the shared bath lest anyone walk in on him.    Hiking north out of Hot Springs with full packs and a full belly (mine; Ernie was too nervous to eat much) was a bit of a challenge since the first eight miles are mostly uphill.  Ernie didn’t use hiking sticks, and I worried that he would fall or jump from the narrow ledges near Lovers Leap.  Getting Ernie the eleven miles to Spring Mountain Shelter took constant encouragement on my part, and I really think that it was only the fear of abandonment that got him moving at all.   There were a few wonderful thru-hikers at the shelter, including Patella (Queen of the Knees) and Marathon Man, so I could enjoy actual conversation.  Ernie sat in the corner, hood up, too anxious to eat much dinner.  
The weather was warm and my sleeping bag was unzipped that night, but Ernie had his sleeping bag fully mummied, with only his nose exposed.  He didn’t emerge in the morning until the other hikers had left.  He then confessed that he was under psychiatric care and that his doctor thought some time in the woods, without his meds, would do him good.  Good thinking, Doc!  We resupplied in Erwin, Tennessee and managed to hike a total of 150 miles to Hampton, Tennessee.  I arranged a shuttle back to Hot Springs for us and we drove back to Chattanooga.  Ernie claimed to have had a wonderful time, but Tom says it is the only time I ever returned home from a hike with more tension than when I had left.   My trail name for Ernie, which he never knew, was Pet Rock, after the short-lived fad of 1975. 
I returned to Hampton a few weeks later and had a lovely solo hike to Damascus, Virginia where I met a friend from Sarasota who had always wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail.  You’ve already met Brenda who earned the trail name Midwife for generously allowing a mouse to give birth in her pack the first night.  She was a children’s librarian and storyteller, and when she was in a good mood, I never had a better trail companion.  Unfortunately, her mood was like a game of chance, a wheel of fortune, and I never knew where the wheel would stop from day to day or hour to hour.  Would I be hiking with the Good Brenda or the Bad Brenda?  When she developed toe blisters, her mood stabilized as dismal.  There were signs of infection, and we starting hitching east on VA Route 603, having no idea where it led.  A Caterpillar sales representative picked us up and took us from town to town, until he found a medical clinic in Konnarock.  While we waited, Brenda fretted about how we knew neither where we were nor how would we get back to the trail.  No problem, I said, the trail will provide.  While she was being treated, a woman who had brought her daughter in for her baby’s first wellness exam started chatting with me.  She looked exactly like Aunt Bee from Andy of Mayberry, wearing a similarly dowdy blue-patterned dress.  We were actually very near Mt. Airy, North Carolina and Fancy Gap, close to the fictional town of Mayberry.  Aunt Bee was apologetic about not being able to take us home with her for the night, but with the baby’s things, there just wasn’t room in her car.  She prevailed upon, more like commanded, a young man to wait for Brenda and then to drive us to a restaurant, so we wouldn’t go away hungry.   Brenda didn’t enjoy her dinner, worrying over how we would get back to the trail. I kept trying to reassure her, and sure enough, as we stood in line at the cash register, a gentlemen who was a maintainer with the Mt. Rogers Appalachian Trail Club asked if those were our packs outside and drove us to the U.S. Forest Service Grindstaff Campground near the trail, introducing us to the campground hosts.  We were treated well there for the night, but Brenda’s toes continued to cause her pain and our hike ended in a couple of days.  I called it quits for the year.
Bringing a friend hasn’t always been bad.  Bill, mentioned in the where-will-you-sleep entry as having an uncanny ability to fall asleep instantly anywhere, was a joy to hike with, even if it meant moderating my goals.  For me it was an easy hike, but Bill suffered mightily, changing his trail name from Blitz to Blitzed.  After the hike, we rented bicycles in Washington, D.C., took them on the train to Pittsburgh, and cycled back via the Great Allegheny Passage and the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal Trail.  We didn’t get to our hotel in Pittsburgh until after 1AM, but Bill insisted that we start peddling at daybreak and ride 68 miles the first day.  He found sweet revenge in my saddle sores.   I’ve invited Bill to join me on hikes since and he’s invited me on his cycling adventures, but we haven’t found common ground again. 
Bob Almand, former chair of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, lives outside of Atlanta.  He joined me on part of the Benton MacKaye Trail and on the Chattooga River Trail in Georgia, where Deliverance was filmed.  He is the most uncomplaining and genuinely cheerful trail companion that I could ever hope to have.  He and his wife Lynn, joined by my husband Tom, will meet me at U.S. Forest Service Road 42 for the final 0.9 miles of my thru-hike.  Ending my thru-hike on Springer Mountain won’t have the drama of Katahdin, but the warmth of this reunion will more than compensate.  
My cousin Debbie, who will be joining me at the start of my thru-hike, is not only a favorite relative but also a boon trail companion.  We’ve hiked together twice and I truly welcome her company.  She needs a trail name, doesn’t she?
So by all means, bring a friend with you on a hike.  What could possibly go wrong?
Meet someone along the way
It’s my habit to spend most nights tenting in the vicinity of a shelter, and it’s not unusual to see the same people night after night or occasionally as I pass them or they pass me.  Sometimes we find that we have something in common and similar habits, like early rising or enjoying zero days (non-hiking days) in towns without an excess of booze.  Friendships form, and if our pace is similar, we might actually hike together during the day and share a motel room in town.  There’s no commitment to stay together ’til death does us part or even until the end of the hike, but it’s nice to know that someone is watching out for you and that you can share experiences.  Long-distance hikers in particular often coalesce into informal groups known as trail families, with members coming in and out over time.  I was adopted into Team Mofo in 2013 on my attempted thru-hike, and it really made the time at shelters and in town most pleasant.  I’ve mentioned my friendship with M that started on the trail and lasted for years.  
In two consecutive years, I ended up hiking with a Lesbian.  By coincidence they were from the opposite ends of the same western state.  Friendship, in the complete absence of sexual tension, was delightful.  In town and even on the trail, we were assumed to be a straight couple, and it does make life easier.  I could act as fey as I liked and she could be impossibly butch, but people only saw what they wanted to see.  I don’t think that straight people really understand what it is like to be gay, even in an enlightened city like Burlington, knowing that you are somewhat marginalized.  I can only imagine what a trans hiker of color must experience.  
Not all trail relationships are so amiable, and on far too many occasions, I’ve found myself burdened with hikers who I can’t seem to shed.  I call them Velcro hikers, cockleburs or beggar ticks.  It’s a distinctly one-sided relationship.  
This past year, in Northern Virginia, on my first night, a hiker of about my age from a western state started a conversation by asking if my wife minded my cheating on her.  Not a good beginning.  I corrected his two misapprehensions, noting that I have a husband and that we are committed to one another.  He didn’t apologize, but he did offer to share his marijuana that he smoked morning, noon, and night.  I declined and went into my tent early, praying that he was hiking north.  I started hiking early the next morning, but by noon, he had caught up to me and talked incessantly to the next shelter.  I said very little, and tried varying my pace, taking rests, and even going down a side trail and hiding until I heard him pass.  Nothing worked and he seemed oblivious to my hints.  Day after day, he popped up whenever I thought I was rid of him.  It rained often on that hike, so I took advantage of the lodging available in Shenandoah National Park, staying at Skyland, Big Meadows Lodge, and even in a cabin at Lewis Mountain Campground, knowing that he was too cheap to do likewise and thinking that the short distances between these facilities, 8.1 and 8.7 miles, respectively, would assure that he would be far ahead of me.  I was gleeful hiking the next day, but there he was at Hightop Hut waiting for me.  One of the reasons I ended that hike at Waynesboro was to escape him.  I really ought to be more forceful, but I don’t want to be rude.  I would rather just write nasty things about them later.
A very attractive young woman asked to hike with me in Maine in 2001, hoping that having an older male around would discourage a young man who she thought was stalking her.  I was glad to oblige, amused to play the unaccustomed role of protector.  I’m more usually the Cowardly Lion before he gained his courage:  “I’m afraid there’s no denyin’ I’m just a dandy-lion.” Yet sometimes I wonder.  One of the lessons that the Appalachian Trail has taught me is that courage is there when I need it, like in confronting the man with a gun in Pennsylvania.  Perhaps I really could be King of the Forest.  Roar!
Whether I take a friend with me or make new friends on the trail, I find hiking with a good companion better than hiking alone.  On the other hand, solitude is infinitely preferable to the wrong companion.  I am curious to see how my thru-hike works out.  A flip-flop hike, even starting from the Flip-Flop Festival in Harpers Ferry, avoids the crush of humanity characterizing a traditional northbound thru-hike starting in Georgia.  Yet except in winter, the Appalachian Trail is always a social trail.  I’ve planned to return home twice during my northbound section, once from the Hudson River (Amtrak is so convenient) and again from Killington (just a two hour drive from Burlington).  Not only will it be good to be with Tom again, but these respites will offer a safety valve against cockleburs.  The breaks will be short enough that I could catch up to a good companion again, but long enough that I would have the opportunity to reset trail friendships.  We will see how it works out.",,View Entry,"Jan 15, Mon",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582359,"Disclaimer:  This is a fictional story set in a fictional place.  There is no real Wendell and no real Enoch, Kansas.  I’ve never been to Kansas.  I know only that it is flat.  Congealed salad, also known as Jell-O salad, is all too real and is my greatest culinary phobia.      
Enoch in southeastern Kansas is an unincorporated town on a minor highway, really just a collection of a couple dozen well-maintained homes in the midst of a sea of wheat.  Enoch was settled in the 1860’s by Silesian Lutherans seeking economic opportunity and also greater holiness of life, free from the pernicious influence of Roman Catholics and educated men.  They weren’t against progress, and indeed, unlike their Amish neighbors in nearby Garnett, embraced electrification in the late 1930’s.  Satellite dishes, painted black so as not to be showy, were common in the early-2000’s when this story unfolds.    Most Enoch families have a single car, usually a Chevy Blazer or a Ford Explorer, always purchased used and painted a dark color.  The  white clapboard wooden church with a short steeple missing its cross, is the center of life in Enoch.  Enoch hasn’t been able to afford an ordained pastor since losing 40% of its population during the Dust Bowl, but that’s only been a blessing.  Seminaries teach too many fanciful notions, like Hebrew, Latin, Greek and hermeneutics, that have nothing to do with the Gospel.  No one is bothered that the one remaining Silesian German Bible, kept under glass in a corner of the church, lies neglected and unreadable to them.  The men of the church preach as the spirit gives them utterance, often in fiercely evangelical paeans, although there is no one to convert since all there believe.  The Bibles in the pews are Gideon Bibles, collected from motel nightstands over the years.  The highlight of Sunday worship is the pot-luck supper that follows in the nearby one-room school house that doubles as a community center.  
The Enoch Lutherans are Lutheran in name only, having nothing to do with any national Lutheran conference.  Like their Amish neighbors, the Enoch Lutherans believe that education after the eighth grade is unnecessary and, indeed, detrimental to faith,  After a long court battle Enoch won an exemption from Kansas’ compulsory education laws.  The church hires a teacher and harmful notions such as tectonic plate theory and evolution are not taught.  Parents are urged to monitor what television their children watch, especially on public television.  NOVA is seen as particularly subversive, promulgating such satanic lies as the Earth being four or five billion years old, quite impossible since the universe was created on October 23, 4004 BC.  Everyone in Enoch knows that.  October 23rd is celebrated each year as Creation Day, with the ladies of the church and town, the two being the same, competing for blue ribbons in pies, cakes, pickles, and congealed salads designed to show forth the glories of creation.   Sculpting Jell-O has been raised to an art form.  
In 1982, a church elder preached a vision that he had received in a dream, leading most Enochians to sell off their farmland, the titles of which dated back to the Homestead Act.  That proved providential as it coincided with the peak in Kansas farmland values.  A trusted banker in Garnett recommended Berkshire Hathaway stock to them.  The families of Enoch became quite wealthy, but the wealth remains covert.  The Silesian work ethic prevails, and everyone works, even if the businesses seldom prosper.  Mrs. Toman enjoys running her café, open five days a week for breakfast and lunch, renowned for her Thursday blue plate special of kluski potato dumplings, fried beef rouladen with gravy, and boiled red cabbage.  Mr. Scholz keeps all of the Enoch cars up and running out of his garage.  Dennis Dittrick, the father of our hero Wendell, owns the used car lot.  Mr. Schlesinger’s General Store is open Mondays, Wednesday and Fridays, but most Enochians  prefer to shop weekly at the Walmart Supercenter in Iola.  
Wendell was born at home in 1982, his mother Gloria attended by the ladies of Enoch led by Helen, who fancied herself a midwife.  The delivery was difficult, and Helen had to resort to using salad tongs as forceps, to bring Wendell kicking and screaming into the world.  The resulting dented head was not pretty, but the people of Enoch are not known for their beauty.  It wasn’t noticed when Wendell was breastfeeding, but when he began transitioning to solid foods, Wendell was found to be indiscriminate in his tastes.  He seemed unable to tell food from nonfoods or even to know when something was salty, bitter or sweet.  Neither was he able to distinguish the smell of onions frying from a rose or a septic tank.  Wendell only knew that he was hungry and felt compelled to put stuff into his mouth and swallow it.  Things that were red were his first preference.  Blue things were never eaten, and different colors should not touch.   
Dennis and Gloria took Wendell to the medical clinic in Garnett for his routine well-baby care and nothing out of the ordinary was noticed until they told the nurse about Wendell’s apparent lack of a sense of taste or smell.  The doctors confirmed the anosmia and ageusia, and recommended a specialist in Kansas City, but Dennis and Gloria saw no need for that.  It was obviously God’s will for their infant, and who were they to dispute providence?  Wendell would just need very close watching over what he put into his mouth, until he was old enough to be taught what was food and what was not.  Wendell grew and thrived, although his language acquisition skills came late.  He could hear and understand normally, but finding the right word and speaking it without a stutter was problematic.  The doctors called it aphasia and recommended speech therapy, but what was the point?  There wasn’t much to be said in Enoch.  Everyone knew what Wendell meant to say and would help him by completing his sentences.  
It might have been expected that Wendell would be teased and bullied by the other children, but not in Enoch.  Everyone in Enoch was a close relation, and truth be told, everyone was a little different.  Wendell was just different in his own way.  With only one extra year needed, Wendell graduated from eighth grade and started working for his father.  Dennis had Wendell detail the cars on the lot so they would be clean and shiny for potential buyers.  Dennis promised Wendell that once he had his driver’s license, he could drive cars back from auction, but mostly Wendell just kept washing and waxing the cars, even when they didn’t need it.  And so Wendell kept his hands busy and avoided becoming the devil’s tool, idleness being a cardinal sin in Enoch.  Wendell dreamed of leaving Enoch as his brother had done.  But what could he do and where could he go?  His brother had left and had been shunned, so Wendell couldn’t ask him.  
At age 18, Wendell joined the church and was baptized.  There was a time when infants had been baptized at Enoch Lutheran, but their Amish friends had taught them better.  Wendell was allowed to move into the tack room of the old barn behind the house and made it into his own place, complete with a small television set and artwork taken from the same motels that provided the Gideon Bibles to the church.  He was particularly partial to a landscape of a mountain valley with a gurgling brook and wondered what it would be like to walk up a hill. He splurged on a toffee-colored Barcalounger, specially ordered at the Walmart. 
Wendell knew it was time to be getting married, but he really had no interest in girls and none was interested in him.  Now that he had privacy, Wendell masturbated, but only once, to see that everything worked.  It did, and that satisfied his curiosity.  He promised God that he never would again and kept his promise.  He thought to himself that if he could only smell pheromones, that he called fairmonts, he might be attracted to women.   
When Wendell wasn’t working, he watched television.  Mindful of his upbringing, Wendell avoided such shows as NOVA and Nature, but loved the public television series, Trailside: Make Your Own Adventure, hosted by John Viehman, the editor of Backpacker Magazine.  Wendell was completely taken by the two-episode show, Thru Hiking the Appalachian Trail, that first aired in November 2001 and followed several hikers and couples on their way from Georgia to Maine.  He watched it on every rebroadcast until he practically knew it by heart.  Hiking the Appalachian Trail became Wendell’s passion, even obsession, and in the summer of 2002, he approached his parents about it.  Dennis and Gloria were naturally confused why their son would ever want to leave Enoch, but when he assured them that it would only be for six months, they approved and obtained permission from the elders for Wendell.  Wendell had had a difficult life, and if this would make him happy, they were glad to consent to his adventure.  
Since he was living at home, Wendell had saved most of his salary, and even after purchasing the Barcalounger, he had several thousand dollars to outfit himself and cover the costs of the hike.  It wasn’t as though he was going to be buying beer or fancy foods along the way.  Wendell ordered catalogs from LL Bean, REI and Campmor, and tried and failed to match the equipment he had seen on Trailsides to the tiny catalog photos.  Frustrated, he borrowed a car from the used car lot, and drove to Kansas City, Missouri, less than two hours away.  A young man working at the outfitter there had thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail in 2000.  With his help, Wendell returned home that afternoon with everything he needed, and not much that he didn’t.  He didn’t buy a camp stove, because what did he need it for?  For Wendell, food was energy and nothing else.  He decided to keep his diet simple.  For breakfast, Wendell planned on Hostess Fried Pies, cherry being his favorite since it was red.  Lunch and dinner would be peanut butter, just smooth peanut butter eaten by the tablespoon.  And for snacks, Wendell chose Little Debbie Oatmeal Creme Pies, high calorie textural yumminess to him.  That, plus Flintstones Chewable Vitamins and hamburgers in town would see him through.
In February 2003, the ladies honored Wendell at the potluck supper following church, featuring a mountain carved from Lime Jell-O with candied walnut rocks as the centerpiece.  Wendell wasn’t asked to speak, because they all knew how difficult that was for him, but the elders gathered around him and laid hands on him in blessing, exhorting him to remain true to the faith, read from Holy Scriptures each day, and pray to the Lord for safekeeping.  Dennis and Gloria dropped Wendell off at the Greyhound Terminal in Kansas City the next morning, in time for the 1:10 PM overnight bus to Atlanta, and he was on his way.  
Riding across Missouri, Wendell pondered what his trail name would be.   He had an hour in St. Louis to change buses, but stayed in the terminal, having heard about the dangers of big cities.  He ate a bit of his peanut butter and a Little Debbie for dessert,.  That night, he dreamed of Doris Day singing, Que Sera, Sera, and found himself humming it as the bus pulled into Atlanta a little after seven o’clock in the morning.  That would be his trail name, Que Sera, Whatever Will Be, for he felt like he was trusting in God on this pilgrimage.  Wendell feared getting lost in the big city of Atlanta, so he had arranged for a shuttle driver to meet him at the bus terminal and drive him to Amicalola Falls State Park near Dawsonville, Georgia.  He was there at 9:30, signed the register in the visitor’s center, weighed his pack (45 pounds) and started his hike, no longer Wendell Dittrick from Enoch, Kansas but Que Sera, an Appalachian Trail thru-hiker.
From Trailside, Que Sera knew better than to start with high mileage days, so he planned on only eight-to-ten mile days the first week, ten-to-twelve miles days the second week, and so on, until he could comfortably hike 18-20 miles a day.  He wore canvas sneakers from Payless Shoes and cotton socks, and never suffered a blister.  Que was average height and slender in build with a thatch of strawberry blond hair over his dented, lopsided face and unable to grow more than few chin whiskers.  Even after several weeks on the trail, Que had a look of pitiful innocence that brought out protective feelings in his fellow thru-hikers.  They included him in conversation, patiently waiting for him to find his words.  With no one rushing him by completing his sentences, the words began to flow more freely.   He didn’t smoke marijuana or drink beer in town, but Que didn’t judge others, so his company was welcome.  For the first time in his life, Wendell experienced belonging and cried from happiness.  Others noticed the tears, and asked him what was wrong.  He tried explaining and that only endeared him more to them when they realized that his innocence was not merely in appearance.  He started each day by saying,”This is the day the Lord has made: we will rejoice and be glad in it,” and was.
Que Sera summited Katahdin in Maine on Labor Day, and true to his word, went home to Enoch, Kansas.  His parents, and indeed, the whole community, were thrilled to see him, having secretly feared that he would be yet another lost child.  The elders gave thanks for his safe return in church that Sunday, and the ladies made an enormous congealed salad for the pot-luck, with a white chocolate hiker on the summit of the green Jell-O mountain, textured with crushed pineapple and mandarin orange slices and set in a lake of blue Cool Whip.  Dennis gave a lovely speech thanking God for the return of his son, thanking the ladies for the lovely feast, and announcing that Wendell’s job at the used car lot was awaiting his return.  Wendell tugged on his father’s sleeve and wanted to say a few words himself, but Dennis shushed him, saying that no one expected him to speak because it was so hard for him and that they all knew that he was thankful to be home again.  
Wendell walked home and went into the tack room where he lived, turned on the television and sat down in his Barcalounger.  He didn’t come into the house for dinner, but Gloria told Dennis that all of the excitement must have worn him out, that he needed his rest.  He didn’t come out the next day.  On the third day, when they still hadn’t seen Wendell, Gloria knocked on the door to the tack room.  Hearing no answer, she opened the door and found Wendell dead in his Barcalounger, the television blaring Nova.",,View Entry,"Jan 24, Wed",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582593,"Leo Tolstoy’s novel, Anna Karenina, starts with a proposition:  “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”  For a family to be happy, it must solve all of a series of critical attributes, such as finances, sexual attraction, religion, in-laws, and parenting.  There’s only one way to have a happy family — solve all of the critical problems, but there are so many ways for a family to be unhappy — simply fail to resolve any one of the issues.  Sociologists and psychologists can debate this, but what has become known as the Anna Karenina Principle has found its way into such disparate fields as statistics (the “null hypothesis”), ecology, business, and anthropology.  
Remember Jared Diamond’s book, Guns, Germs and Steel (1997), and his later book, Collapse:  How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed (2005)?  Diamond defines six factors that must each be satisfied in order for an animal to be domesticated, including that they be easy to feed, grow rapidly, breed in captivity, and not be overly nasty.   In his second book, Diamond asserts that societies must solve critical environmental problems such as habitat destruction, soil health, water management, and overpopulation or risk collapse.  Ever the optimist, Diamond adds an additional four challenges facing the world today, including climate change and the buildup of toxins in the environment.  Diamond’s point is that success in domesticating an animal or for a society to avoid collapse depends upon solving every critical problem, not just six out of ten or three out of four.  Failure in any single area can doom the entire enterprise.
As a CPA in public practice, I worked with a lot of startup businesses. Startup businesses need to solve a series of problems including financial, human resources, production, and marketing to have a chance of succeeding in a competitive marketplace.   While good planning and adequate capital are essential, they are hardly sufficient to guarantee success.  There are so many ways for a small business to fail, and my clients competed to find new ones.  Failure in a single area could doom the venture.  It is no wonder that most startup businesses fail and quite amazing that any succeed.  
I don’t know why Anna Karenina popped into my head this morning, but there she was.  I had been thinking about writing about the dumb things I have done while hiking the Appalachian Trail.  They are legion and the competition for the title of dumbest would be fierce.  Confronting the deranged man with a gun in Pennsylvania might rise to the top.  Or less dramatically, it might be wandering away from my tent on a moonless night without a headlamp or flashlight and spending the rest of the night seated against the trunk of a tree.  Thinking of Anna or at least the opening sentence, however, caused me to wonder about the critical attributes of a happy thru-hike.  My goal this year is not merely to succeed in my thru-hike, but to have a happy thru-hike.  We all know families that stay together not out of happiness but instead out of misguided notions of Mutually Assured Destruction:  I may not be happy, but if my spouse is miserable enough, the marriage may be worth saving.  Or perhaps the delusion that raising children in an armed camp is better for them than having divorced parents.  
It’s often said that the chance of a marriage ending in divorce is about 50%.  The odds of a successful thru-hike are even more dismal — about three out of four end in failure, a figure so stark that we often define away the notion of failure, commending ourselves for having made a splendid effort, as though that were the objective all along.  I’ve seen many thru-hikers give up, abandoning a venture that required significant investment in gear and restructuring life to carve out the time.   I’ve done it myself, in 2013, when my knees gave out.  About a quarter of north-bound thru-hikers abandon their hikes before leaving Georgia.  I recall a mother-daughter team in 1994, both obese and dressed in black body suits said to be slimming, cheerful and excited about jointly losing several hundred pounds, giving up on their first steep climb, Sassafras Mountain, barely 11.5 miles from the start.  I’ve seen a young man surrender in Vermont in 1998 after 1,700 miles, simply because he was out of energy.  When he hit the Green Mountains after the relatively easy terrain of the Mid-Atlantic and southern New England, he no longer had the strength and stamina required.  Many hikers find themselves in tears on the summit of Katahdin, a mess of conflicting emotions from the joy of having completed their chosen pilgrimage, that this remarkable period in their lives was over, and the sorrow in knowing that deep trail friendships were likely over as well.  I’ve also seen bitter tears on Katahdin and heard the words, “Now I can go home and never hike again.  This was the most miserable experience of my life.” I don’t want my thru-hike to be a death march, to be endured instead of being enjoyed.
So what are the attributes of a happy thru-hike?  When I think back to my happiest times on the trail, there were certain common traits:  good weather, good health, good trail, good companions, and good food.  Those days are memorable for their rarity and couldn’t possibly be sustained for six months.  Imagine how boring my journal would be if each entry read:
""I woke up refreshed from a good night’s sleep, quickly packed up, and walked 0.3 miles to the road crossing where I found a country restaurant offering a hiker special breakfast of three eggs, three strips of bacon, three sausage patties, home fries, endless buckwheat pancakes with Vermont maple syrup, cathead biscuits with hand-churned butter and wild honey, a compote of fresh berries with a yogurt honey sauce, fresh-squeezed orange juice, shade-grown organic coffee, all for $3.95!  While I was eating, the sun rose in a crystal blue sky, and I saw a weather forecast promising a high of 68 degrees and a gentle breeze.  The trail today was well-maintained with a nary a rock or a root and not a mud puddle to be found.  My mind drifted off in meditation, leaving my feet to find their way.  They brought me to an open glade with a piped spring at noon.  I devoured an Italian sandwich on fresh ciabatta that I carried out from the café this morning.  After gently rolling trail this afternoon, my feet delivered me to a brand new shelter just in time for the club’s dedication celebration and feast.  I even got to inaugurate the new moldering privy, complete with toilet paper in a mouse-proof container.""
In fact, all of the things in this imaginary entry have happened to me, but not on the same day, and not for $3.95.  As a hiker, I might prefer that each day be filled with sunshine, trail that hikes itself, and abundant nutritious food, but that isn’t real life, and it quickly become boring, especially for you as a reader.  You would rather that I play Odysseus and have to have myself tied to the mast to resist the lure of the Sirens and to prove my cunning by escaping the cave of the Cyclops.   Perhaps my hike needs a mythic arc.  
I recently binge-watched the first season of the Myths & Monsters series.  It’s very repetitious but the presenter, Nicholas Day, has one of those English voices that assures me a good nap.  It served to remind me of Joseph Campbell’s monomyth and the stages of the hero’s journey, from the known world, into the unknown, and back again (The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949)).  Campbell described seventeen stages, condensed by Christopher Vogler to twelve stages in his guide for writers, The Writer’s Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers (2007):  
  Departure
     The ordinary world
     The call to adventure
     Refusal of the call
     Meeting with the mentor
     Crossing the threshold to the special world
  Initiation
     Tests, allies and enemies
     Approach to the innermost cave
     The ordeal
     Reward
  Return
     The road back
     The resurrection
     Return with the elixir
There are many versions, and it isn’t hard to apply them to the Odyssey, Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings, Wagner’s Ring Cycle, Frank Baum’s The Wizard of Oz, C.S. Lewis’ The Chronicles of Narnia, and even the New Testament.  When I complete my thru-hike (note that I refuse to say “if”) and can think of nothing else to do, perhaps I’ll make the effort to restructure my journal as a book using this structure.  There is the problem that in embracing the name Sugarfoot in 2001, I identified myself with an anti-hero, but I am no more unlikely a hero than Bilbo or Frodo Baggins.  
I don’t think it is possible to write contemporaneously in an heroic format.  It is the same problem as defining oneself as a gentleman.  A dear client had sufficient income from trust funds to assure that he never had to work but not quite sufficient for his desires.  His French cuffs were always slightly frayed and his Rolls Royce was an older model.  I asked how we should enter his occupation on his tax return.  He suggested “unemployed,” but I didn’t think that was accurate since he had never sought employment.  I suggested “gentleman,” and he was aghast, exclaiming, “If I called myself a gentleman, I would lose all pretense of being one.”  We settled on “not employed.”  So the heroic arc can only be applied in retrospect, and doesn’t help me in defining the attributes of a happy thru-hike.
I’ve reflected back on past hikes, both the good and the bad, and offer the following critical attributes for a happy thru-hike to which the Anna Karenina Principle applies.  Failure to solve any single attribute may not end my thru-hike, but it will assure that it won’t be a happy one.
Health
I will start in good condition, near my ideal weight.  My fitness program combines strength training, aerobics, balance, and flexibility.  After just two weeks of hiking, my muscles will be weaker than when I start but will have adapted to the specific demands of the trail.  I plan to continue my stretching and knee exercises on the trail.  I will take precautions against ticks.
Timing
I’ve chosen to do a flip-flop thru-hike, so I won’t feel time pressure to get to Maine before Katahdin closes for the season or through the Smokies before the first snows of late autumn. A flip-flop hike also lets me avoid the crowds.  I will start with low mileage days and increase my daily mileage gradually.  I’ll take zero days when my body or mind needs a break.  I will try to take my time and be willing to walk a few tenths of a mile to enjoy a scenic view.  
Gear
I won’t obsess about gear.  I’ve refined my gear list over the years to be lightweight and functional, but I also carry things that bring me comfort.  
Nutrition
I won’t say no to food  The only weight I don’t mind carrying is food, so long as I eat it all before resupplying.  I will seek out restaurants and gas station delis within one half mile of the trail and eat as much salad and fresh fruit as possible in town.  
Adversity
I expect adversity and will greet it with humor.  The trail is usually a path of rocks, roots, and mud.  I will embrace it, especially in the rain, and splash in the puddles.
Perseverance
I will not quit on a rainy day or at the first pain or injury.  If I am tempted to quit, I will wait at least three days.  The weather will change.  A rest day in town may be all that I need.  Meeting someone new or having a good meal in town may restore my outlook.
Opportunity
I will say yes to adventure.  Scheduling this hike in detail has been a good planning exercise, but it is also the greatest fiction I will ever write.  I welcome side trips and seeing what it over the next ridge.  I will rejoice in surprises.
Companions
I will seek out good companions and shed the rest.  I have a problem getting rid of companions I don’t like, but I’ll work on it, being honest with myself.  It’s okay if I don’t like everyone and if not everyone likes me.  If exploring side trails and varying my pace doesn’t work, then I may rent a car and sightsee for a few days, or even risk a direct confrontation.   
 
It’s now three months before I start my thru-hike, and that time will pass quickly.  I start working half-time on Monday for the duration of tax season.  Each day in the office means two bed & breakfast stays, and that makes it bearable.  Working will impact my fitness program, limiting me to four days a week at the Y.  It also means less time to write in this journal, but haven’t I already said enough?  There are many more stories, and revisiting places on the trail will help me to recall them.  The strange thing about hiking the same sections of the Appalachian Trail repeatedly is that time starts to blur.  It’s neither linear nor circular but a gestalt - the trail I’ll experience this year will be equal parts of this year’s hike and memories of  past hikes, so that the whole is more than the sum of the parts.   The Appalachian Trail is an old friend tor me, one that is always changing and surprising me at every turn. 
I’ll let Leo Tolstoy have the last word, from Anna Karenina.  “All the diversity, all the charm, and all the beauty of life are made up of light and shade.""",,View Entry,"Jan 31, Wed",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582730,"I recently flipped through the 2018 Appalachian Trail Thru-Hikers’ Companion, seeing what town services and hostels were new this year and which had been closed.  It’s a fine publication and in combination with Guthook’s Hiking Guide App downloaded to my iPhone is really all the information I need for a thru-hike.  Guthook increasingly includes information on town services as well, with user comments providing updates and current information.  I got to thinking about the old days, before ATC and ALDHA started publishing the Companion, when the primary thru-hiking resource was The Thru-Hiker’s Handbook, edited by Dan “Wingfoot” Bruce.  Wingfoot was a fierce advocate of the Trail, making many friends and some foes.  His comments on specific shelters led to hikers bunching up in the “good” shelters and avoiding the mousy ones.  As the number of hikers increased, this exasperated the crowding.  The Companion wisely omits those descriptions now.  I miss Wingfoot's short wildflower guide, sorted by flower color.  I found it very helpful in the days before cellphones and wildflower apps.   Wingfoot included a lot of trail lore that became part of the common hiker culture.  I miss it.  The Companion still has the ghost of Little Ottie Cline Powell haunting Punchbowl Shelter in Virginia, but no mention is made of the 1916 elephant lynching in Erwin, Tennessee.  The Cherokee have been relegated to a brief mention in connection with Blood Mountain and as a possible side trip to Cherokee, North Carolina from Newfound Gap in the Smokies, but not a clue is given as to the extent of their lands crossed by the Appalachian Trail or what happened to them.  I understand that there is a need to keep the weight of the Companion low, especially in competition with The AT Guide, published by David “AWOL” Miller.  David manages to fit a tremendous amount of information into very little space, confusing my poor old eyes.  It contains even less lore and contextual information than the Companion but is probably the more popular resource.  As a result, many Appalachian Trail thru-hikers today hike with blinders on, unaware and unconcerned with the cultural and natural history of the lands they traverse.  
That knowledge isn’t necessary for a successful thru-hike any more than knowledge of pigment grinding, scaffolding construction, and plaster application is needed to appreciate Michelangelo’s frescos on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.  It may just be a section hiker thing, but especially with the information available on the internet, I enjoy researching the section of the trail I will be hiking and learning its history, unique flora and fauna, and even its geology.  I also learn about the maintaining club(s) for the section and about trail relocations and controversies, like proposed mines or power line crossings.  These layers of meaning undergird my experience on the trail itself, making me feel even more connected to the Trail.  Putting names to things doesn’t diminish the sore muscles, blisters and ecstatic oohs and aahs one bit.
So in this entry and the next, I’ll explore, quite briefly, the cultural history of the Appalachian Trail, hoping to tempt you to learn more before or during your hike.  Many towns have historical societies and museums. They are delighted to have a hiker visit, since so few do.  When you hike into a town, ask yourself why the town exists and see if you can discover the reason.  It’s a good way to spend a zero day.  I’ve divided my discussion into the southern and northern halves of the Appalachian Trail, because the character of the trail changes remarkably at the Potomac River.  South of the Potomac, most of the land traversed by the Trail is either in National Forest or within units of the National Park System, like the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Blue Ridge Parkway, Shenandoah National Park, or the Harpers Ferry National Historical Park.  North of the Potomac, the Appalachian Trail tends to be within a relatively narrow corridor of land specifically purchased to protect the Appalachian National Scenic Trail (itself a unit of the National Park System) or on state park or game lands.  The trail in the South is a story of the displacement of people during the creation of the national forests and parks.  The trail in the North is a story of industrial development.  Wars, specifically the French & Indian, Revolutionary and Civil Wars, color them both.
I love the southern Appalachian Trail for its splendid isolation, especially the sections contained within national forests, including the Chattahoochee in Georgia, Nantahalla and Pisgah in North Carolina, Cherokee in Tennessee, and the George Washington and Jefferson Forest in Virginia.  There’s a feeling that the trees go on forever.  Many times I am unable to hear any sound of civilization other than an occasional train whistle from a distant crossing.  The only visible sign of humankind, other than the trail itself, are contrails far above.  It’s pleasant to think of the trees as having been there forever, like Longfellow’s introduction to Evangeline:  
     This is the forest primeval.  The murmuring pines and the hemlocks,
     Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight,
     Stand like Druids of old, with voices sad and prophetic.
The illusion is transitory, broken by stone walls, foundations of abandoned homesteads and villages, and graveyards.  Patches of lily of the valley are lovely to see, but it’s a nonnative plant that was commonly planted near homesteads.  Looking closely, I can often find the foundation stones.  Logging chains and broken blades are not uncommon.  If you’ve ever visited the Joyce Kilmer Memorial Forest near Robbinsville, North Carolina, 3,800 acres of virgin forest, you will sense the difference at once.  There are remnants of old growth forest along the southern Appalachian Trail, around Three Rivers just north of Springer Mountain and a ravine north of Hot Springs, North Carolina that was too steep for profitable logging.  Curiously, there may be more old growth forest along the northern Appalachian Trail:  Mount Everett in southwestern Massachusetts and the Hermitage in Gulf Hagas in the Hundred Mile Wilderness in Maine.
When I started hiking the Appalachian Trail, I didn’t concern myself with these things.  Finding my way and making my distances took my entire focus and effort.  It was only on rehiking these sections, that I started to look around more and to stop and puzzle things out.  Who were the people who lived on these lands?  What happened to them?  The internet made answers easy to find, and it adds another layer of meaning to the Appalachian Trail for me, often an unhappy layer.
Start with the our country’s shameful treatment of the Cherokee in Georgia and North Carolina.  You won’t leave the Museum of the Cherokee Indian in Cherokee, North Carolina without your own trail of tears.  President Andrew Jackson, whose portrait currently graces the Oval Office and our $20 bill, signed the Indian Removal Act in 1930.  Surely it is mere coincidence that the Georgia Gold Rush started in Dahlonega in 1929, that lands previously thought to be worthless were suddenly coveted?  
Continue north to Great Smoky Mountains National Park, once part of the Cherokee homeland.  With only a remnant Indian population after the forced removal, white settlers arrived, most engaged in subsidence farming, mining or logging on a small scale.    Industrial scale logging arrived In the late 19th century.   Large swaths of the present park had been clearcut by the time Congress authorized the national park in1926 and logging accelerated until the park was established in 1934.  The white homesteaders, miners and loggers were gradually evicted.  Additional communities were destroyed when the Tennessee Valley Authority built Fontana Dam.  The displaced people were promised construction of a road to access their family cemeteries. That would have been an environmental disaster and was finally averted in 2010 with a $52 million cash settlement to Swain County, North Carolina.  The six miles of the road that were build, start in Bryson City and is officially designated Lakeview Drive. It is known to most as the Road to Nowhere, a reminder of the broken promise.
As you walk through the Pisgah and Cherokee National Forests of North Carolina and Tennessee, evidence of the dispossessed is abundant.  Pisgah National Forest, over 500,000 acres, started with 87,000 acres of land acquired from the Vanderbilt family, land that had been part of the Biltmore Estate.  By the time of the Vanderbilt and U.S. Forest Service acquisitions, there had already been widespread farm abandonment and significant environmental degradation.  Southern trees grow quickly and cover a multitude of sins.  Private inholdings remain in the forest, often subsidence farms, some with tobacco allotments.  Max Patch, 15 miles trail north of the Smokies, is maintained as open space by mowing operations today instead of by the grazing cows and sheep of a hundred years ago.  The Cherokee National Forest has over 1,700 cultural properties within its boundaries.  If you look carefully as hike, you will see the evidence of the Scots-Irish, German and English settlements dating back to the late 18th century, many of which were abandoned when large scale timber operations started in the 1880’s.  
About 375 miles of the Appalachian Trail pass through the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests in Virginia.  The written histories of the forests on the U.S. Forest website reference land acquisitions but not the people who were displaced in the process.  They left much behind.   
Hiking Virginia means coming to grips with the evidence of slavery.  Going to high school in Norfolk, Virginia in the mid-1960’s, there was little mention of slavery.  I was taught that what little slavery there was in Virginia was confined to Tidewater and the piedmont.  The land in the mountains, I was told, was too poor to support plantations.  My younger brother’s sixth grade history textbook even referred to slavery as a benevolent institution.  “Why, they were even given a Christmas drink!”  Really.  On a rainy zero day in Pearisburg, Virginia, I visited the Giles County Historical Museum in an 1829 Georgian manor house in the heart of downtown.  I was particularly struck by one photo taken shortly after the Civil War of two women seated on a garden bench.  A proper Southern white lady, dressed to the nines, is seated on one side of the bench.  Beside her is an African American dressed in considerably simpler clothes and described as her “long time companion.”   It didn’t take much imagination to realize the companion was the lady’s servant who had been her slave just a few years previously.  The War meant that they could be photographed seated together, but I wondered if much else had changed.  A bit further north in Amherst County, near Lynchburg and Lexington, I hiked through the remains of the Brown Mountain Creek Community.  I was told at the time that it was a late 18th century community of freed slaves, some of whom owned slaves.  I recently found a scholarly article on the website of the Natural Bridge Appalachian Trail Club:  https://www.nbatc.org/pdfs/Barnes_2011a.pdf.  The Brown Mountain Creek Community actually started with the 1868 purchase of 220 acres by Moses Richeson, who prior to emancipation had been enslaved on the Jesse Richeson plantation there.  By 1878, the African American community covered 354 acres, freely trading with surrounding white merchants.  The community thrived even as industrialization came to Lynchburg.  Having polluted the James River, Lynchburg turned to the Pedlar Creek basin for its water supply.  Coincident with the rise of Jim Crow laws and possibly the embarrassment of having a prosperous African American community in their midst, the City of Lynchburg started purchasing land in the drainage basin in 1906 with the stated purposes of protecting its water supply and for recreational purposes.  By 1920, the Brown Mountain Creek Community was history and its residents dispersed.
During the creation of Shenandoah National Park in the 1930’s, the Commonwealth of Virginia exercised its power of eminent domain and forced about 2,800 people from their homes.  Walking through a cemetery near Big Meadows Wayside, I noticed an unusual family name that was shared by one of my clients.  I asked her, and found that her former husband’s family was among the dispossessed.  The planning for park facilities in Jim Crow Virginia included racial segregation.  All of the concessions were designated “whites only” with the exception of Lewis Mountain Campground, set aside for African Americans.  The dining room at Lewis Mountain reportedly had the best food and music in the Park.  Whites were allowed to dine there, but only at certain tables, and they had to be gone before the dancing started.  By the early 1950’s, Shenandoah National Park was fully integrated.  Unfortunately for today’s hikers, the dining room at Lewis Mountain is no more, but cabins can still be rented.  
Walking through the southern Appalachians is more than a remembrance of displaced people and enslaved people.  It’s also walking through wars.   
Blood Mountain in Georgia is said to have gotten its name from a battle between the Creek and Cherokee Nations that left so many dead that the ground ran red with blood.  I prefer to think that Blood Mountain got its name from the flame azaleas that turn the mountain red in the Spring.  Wishful thinking on my part. 
On Cold Spring Mountain in Tennessee, just north of Big Butt, is a small cemetery.  Buried in a common grave are David Shelton and his nephew William, Union soldiers from Madison County, North Carolina who were ambushed by Confederate troops in 1864 while returning home for a family gathering.  There’s a third body buried in the common grave, Millard Fillmore Haire, a13-year old relative who was leading them home.  In 1915, the U.S. Government erected gravestones for the Shelton boys, but because Millard was a civilian, his stone had to wait until his family could afford one and could obtain permission from the Forest Service to erect it.  
At Yellow Mountain Gap, just north of Roan Mountain, the Appalachian Trail crosses the Overmountain Victory National Historic Trail that commemorates the route followed by mountain men from east Tennessee, who in 1780 marched 330 miles to turn the tide of the pivotal Revolutionary War Battle of Kings Mountain near Charlotte, North Carolina.  
During the Civil War, the Blue Ridge gaps in central and northern Virginia saw frequent troop movements and skirmishes,  with major battles in Front Royal and throughout the Shenandoah Valley.  The present Appalachian Trail marks the western border of John S. Mosby’s Confederacy from Snickers Gap to Manassas Gap.   
Robert Harper purchased the land that would be known as Harpers Ferry from Lord Fairfax in 1751.  It is ironic that a town founded by a Quaker would become an armory operated by the U.S. Government, producing in excess of 600,000 muskets, rifles and pistols and pioneering the use of interchangeable parts in firearms manufacture.  In 1859, abolitionist John Brown seized the armory in a failed effort to spark a slave rebellion.  The raid ended with his capture by U.S. Army Colonel Robert E. Lee and his hanging two years later.   During the Civil War, Harpers Ferry changed hands eight times.  The lower town of Harpers Ferry is a National Historical Park. Heading south from Lower Town, the Appalachian Trail threads between St. Peter’s Roman Catholic Church and St. John’s Episcopal Church.  Both served as hospitals during the Civil War.  St. Peter’s survived intact and remains an active parish.  St. John’s stands in ruins.  Go figure.  The headquarters of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy is located above the historic town, adjacent to the campus of Storer College, an historically black college that operated until 1955.  The campus is now used as an interpretive center for the National Park Service.  The first meeting of the Niagara Movement on U.S. soil was led by W. E. B. Du Bois at Storer College in 1906.  Founded in 1905, the Niagara Movement was opposed to the accommodation and conciliation policies of African-American leaders such as Booker T. Washington and is viewed as the precursor to the NAACP.  
In 2005, I served as treasurer of Appalachian Trail Conservancy.  One of my fellow board members was Robert Stanton, retired director of the National Park Service, the first African American to hold that position and the last director to have been a career civil service employee.  The board meetings were held on the Storer College campus.  I was between committee meetings and was clearing my head by walking around the campus.  Bob arrived late and apologized, saying that it couldn’t be helped, that he had just delivered the keynote address at the centennial cerebration of the Niagara movement.  He asked if I knew what that was.   I answered in detail, having just read the historical marker at the Storer College gates.  He asked, “How do you know that?”  I responded, “It’s my history.”  He looked at me closely and asked, “You black?”  I answered, “No, but it’s my history.”  And that’s the way I feel about everything I’ve written above.   
A story that is largely forgotten among hikers is the Hanging Elephant of Erwin, Tennessee.  In September 1916, The Sparks World Famous Shows Circus played Kingsport, Tennessee.  The star of the show was Mary, the largest circus elephant of the day.  A homeless man without any experience was hired as the assistant elephant trainer and assigned to lead the elephant parade, riding on Mary’s back.  At one point, Mary stopped to reach down and nibble on a piece of watermelon, and her new trainer reprimanded her, striking her with an elephant hook.  Previously, Mary had always been treated with kindness, and she didn’t react well to the cruel treatment, snatching the new trainer off her back with her trunk and throwing him to the ground.  She then stepped on his head, crushing it.  The crowd chanted, “Kill the elephant; kill the elephant!”  Five shots were fired to little effect, and rumor has it that attempts were made to poison Mary and even to electrocute her.  By then Mary was becoming suspicious.  The following day, Mary was brought by train to the Clinchfield Railroad switching yard in nearby Erwin and hanged by the neck from a railcar-mounted crane.  As bad as the elephant hanging was, two years later, the citizens of Erwin lynched Tom Devert, an African American man accused of grabbing a 15 year old white girl. The remaining African American citizens were driven out of Erwin.  Today, Erwin is ashamed of its role in the lynching of the elephant.  African Americans comprise 0.29% of the population of Erwin.  By comparison, Kingsport and Johnson City, Tennessee are 4.22% and 6.4% African American, respectively.  As Wingfoot put it, “Erwin is an increasingly friendly town for elephants.”
I’m neither Cherokee, a mountain man, a Son of the Confederacy, a murderer of elephants, nor enslaved.  In hiking the Appalachian Trail, I become all of these things and they become my history.  I regret that so many hikers see the Trail only as a path to adventure.  It is so much more, even if the stories are not always happy ones.",,View Entry,"Feb 07, Wed",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583048,"There are hints of industrialization along the southern Appalachian Trail.  Damascus, Virginia, as its name suggests, aspired to be a steel manufacturing center, having abundant water power, timber, and iron ore.  Unfortunately, the iron deposits proved to be mostly low grade surface deposits, and Damascus is not exactly a transportation hub.  Waynesboro, Virginia also had steel-making ambitions, but the Bessemer process was patented and unavailable.  Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, with its Federal armory and related industries marks the start of a more industrial backdrop for the Appalachian Trail with the Potomac River serving as the boundary between historically a largely agrarian society in the south and a rising industrial power in the north, a distinction made even more apparent by the Civil War.   
The Trail crosses the Potomac on a pedestrian walkway cantilevered from a railroad bridge and descends an iron staircase to the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal.  Both the canal and the train are monuments to early 19th century industrial might.  When the Erie Canal opened in 1825, connecting the Great Lakes to the Hudson River and the port of New York, there was panic in the ports of Baltimore and more southern cities, caused by the fear that New York would dominate trade.  On July 4, 1828, construction broke ground on both the C&O Canal and the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (now a part of CSX). They were immediately in fierce competition with each other in the race for midwestern markets.  The trains won, and the Canal was constructed only as far west as Cumberland, Maryland.  
The precursor to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company was the Potowmack Company founded by George Washington, intended to provide a water route from the the Ohio River at Pittsburgh to Georgetown.  Aside from believing that the “western” lands were essential to the prosperity of the new United States, Washington also owned over 20,000 acres in the Shenandoah Valley and what is now West Virginia, including grants that he received for his service in the French & Indian War.  These lands would greatly increase in value with access to eastern markets and ports.   
The Appalachian Trail turns east after crossing the Potomac, but just a few hundred feet to the west (upstream) is Lock 33 and the start of a loop trail up Maryland Heights.  The view of Harpers Ferry from the fortifications on Maryland Heights makes its strategic importance obvious.  It’s a good destination on a zero day.  For three miles the Appalachian Trail follows the C&O Canal Towpath, a rare level easy section.  After climbing Weaverton Heights, the AT follows the ridge of South Mountain through Maryland.  Crampton Gap, Turner’s Gap and Fox’s Gap each saw Civil War battles, and Antietam is immediately to the west of the ridge.  Union Major General Jesse Reno and Confederate Brigadier General Samuel Garland, Jr. were killed at Fox’s Gap.  The owner of the land, farmer Daniel Wise, paid one dollar each to bury the Confederate dead.  Sixty or more bodies were dumped down his dry well.  Take time to read the historical markers and to allow the ghosts to rise.
Near Boonsboro, Maryland, the Appalachian Trail passes through Washington Monument State Park featuring the first completed monument dedicated to George Washington.  The 40-foot-tall stone tower is shaped like a creamery bottle, the kind used in the lab to raise Drosophila.  It has a commanding view of the surrounding land and served as a Union signal station during the Civil War.  
The Appalachian Trail’s final stop in Maryland is Pen Mar Park, a county park that started as an amusement park and resort developed by the Western Maryland Railroad, opening in 1877.  Excursion trains ran from Baltimore, and single day attendance peaked at nearly 20,000, an enormous number considering that Disney World averages just a bit more than 50,000 in daily attendance.  Band concerts are still held in the pavilion during summer months.  The Mason-Dixon line is immediately north of the park.  
Southeastern Pennsylvania was the center of the iron industry from colonial times into the late 19th century when it was made obsolete by the open hearth and Bessemer processes of steel production centered in Pittsburgh.   The smelting of iron ore is a relatively simple process, requiring iron ore (obviously), limestone (to form flux to remove impurities), charcoal (for fuel) and running water (to operate bellows and rock crushers).  These resources were abundant in southeastern Pennsylvania.  Furnaces for the smelting of iron and forges to purify the iron and manufacture consumer goods dot the Appalachian Trail in Pennsylvania.  The Trail passes through Old Forge Park, Caledonia State Park, Pine Grove Furnace State Park and Windsor Furnace.  Circular burn marks from charcoal ricks (reductive burning of wood) are visible on level areas along the Trail. The iron works in these rural locales were self-sufficient communities, sometimes called iron plantations, with not only the constructions needed for iron manufacturing but also agriculture, shops, and skilled artisans.  By the 19th century, most of the workers were either free workers or indentured servants.  Blacks and whites worked side-by-side.  The better jobs, however, tended to be reserved for whites.  The diverse labor population and often sympathetic Quaker owners made it fairly easy for runaway slaves to find shelter and employment, making them important stops along the Underground Railroad.  
The Ironmaster’s Mansion in Pine Grove Furnace State Park, operated as a hostel today, has a subbasement accessible through a hidden trap door that was used to shelter enslaved people seeking freedom. Imagine sitting in that hole with no light, praying not to be discovered, hearing only your own heartbeat and footsteps above.  The Appalachian Trail Museum occupies a 200-year old grist mill in the Park.  Across the street is the General Store, where it is traditional for northbound thru-hikers to attempt to eat a half gallon of ice cream in a single sitting to celebrate their completion of nearly one-half of the Trail. Gettysburg is a mere twenty miles away.
Duncannon on the Susquehanna River was a major logging center and manufacturer of barrel staves and caskets, and also Lightning Glider Sleds.  The Doyle Hotel here was an historic Anheuser-Busch hotel catering to the loggers and now offers inexpensive lodging and excellent food and beers to hikers.  Thirty miles downstream sits a monument to 20th century industrial hubris, the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station that suffered a partial melt down in 1979, a case of life imitating art, the film The China Syndrome having premiered 12 days before the accident.   
Rausch Gap Shelter is near an early 19th century anthracite mine with a blue-blazed trail leading to the town abandoned in 1910.   Between Rausch Gap and Port Clinton, the Trail crosses the site of Fort Detrich Snyder, a minor observation post during the French & Indian War, where a young lieutenant Benjamin Franklin served.  Port Clinton on the Schuylkill River was a train depot for the shipment of low-sulfur anthracite coal to the western Pennsylvania steel mills.  
The 84 miles of Trail between Port Clinton and Wind Gap near Delaware Water Gap is infamous for its rocks, fields of little pointy rocks that shift when you commit your weight to them.  The rocks repeated froze and fractured during the last ice age.  They are unrelenting, punctuated only by the Superfund site near Palmerton in the Lehigh Valley.  Fumes from a zinc smelter there denuded the hillsides and contaminated the soil with cadmium and other metals.  Metallica Spring is not recommended as a water source, but I have seen six-legged frogs enjoying it.
The Appalachian Trail in New Jersey comes as a pleasant surprise to people whose only experience of the Garden State is the I-95 corridor.  Kittatinny Ridge paralleling the Delaware River is largely protected by state parks and the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.  The area around Vernon was extensively mined for iron ore.  The Trail mostly transects lands that no one wanted, boundary lands, so avoided wars.  In New Jersey,  I’ve seen bear, coyote, fox, bobcat, and even a diamondback terrapin crossing the Trail back before the Pochuck Boardwalk was constructed and the Trail followed low roads around the marshland.  The terrapin is classified as Near Threatened but was once considered the quintessential soup turtle.  
In New York, the Appalachian Trail passes through lands with a rich history of iron ore mining and manufacture, including Sterling Forest, Bear Mountain, and Harriman State Park.  In February 1778, an iron chain was strung across the Hudson River at West Point, seven miles north of Bear Mountain, to block British ships.  The chain was forged at the Sterling works.
The Appalachian Trail follows the Housatonic River Valley through Connecticut and Massachusetts.  The Valley was historically chockablock with Industries that utilized waterpower, including sawmills, gristmills, fulling and carding mills, textile factories, paper mills, and yet more iron furnaces and foundries.  Crane & Company in Dalton, Massachusetts has supplied the United States Treasury with its currency paper since 1879.  I hope to convince myself to take the time to visit their Museum of Papermaking this year.  In Sheffield, Massachusetts, the Trail passes by a monument to Shay’s Rebellion.  This armed uprising during 1786 and 1787 was in protest against various economic and civil rights injustices, catalyzed by a cataclysmic contraction in credit relied upon by subsistence farmers in western Massachusetts.  The Rebellion failed but succeeded in bringing George Washington back into public life and provided the Federalists with a clear demonstration of the weakness of the country under the Articles of Confederation.  This led directly to the Second Continental Congress and the drafting of our present Constitution.  Shay’s Rebellion, though it dealt with excise taxes on whiskey, is distinct from the Whiskey Rebellion in western Pennsylvania in 1791 to 1794, that provided then President George Washington with the opportunity to demonstrate both the need and the power of a strong federal government.  What is it about alcohol and rebellion?
Welcome to Vermont!  Vermont was an independent republic from 1777 to 1791, when it entered the Union as the 14th state.  Its constitution was the first to provide for the abolition of slavery, suffrage for men who did not own property, and public education.  Today, the largest industry in Vermont is quaintness.  Billboards were banned in 1968.  Multitudes of bed & breakfasts vie in the categories of cutest, friendliest, and best breakfast.  Vermont is used as an adjective for a wide range of artisanal products, including maple syrup, cheeses and craft beers.  Don’t leave the state without trying a clothbound cheddar and Alchemist Brewing’s Heady Topper Double IPA!  Ben & Jerry’s has grown too large to rely solely upon Vermont cows.  Contrary to rumors, there are more people in Vermont than cows, although 150 years ago there were more sheep than people. Wool production and clothing mills, along with quarrying, were major industries in Vermont. Farms still tend to be small and family-owned.  
For the Appalachian Trail hiker, Vermont is a peaceful respite, a lovely walk following the Long Trail through the Green Mountain National Forest, with the first high mountains since Virginia.  Through a series of complex real estate transactions, the Appalachian Trail now avoids crossing the ski slopes on Bromley, Stratton, Pica and Killington, but there are side trails to gondola stations and even a rather steep trail to a restaurant atop Killington.  On the northbound descent of Killington, the AT crosses VT Route 4 about a mile downhill from the Inn at Long Trail at Sherburne Pass, Vermont’s oldest ski lodge.  It is worth the walk for the Celtic pub with fresh Guinness and other Irish beers, a fine selection of Irish single pot whiskies, and live Celtic music on the weekends.  Limited lodging for hikers is available.  Just north of the Inn is the Maine Junction.  The Long Trail continues north to Canada over increasingly rugged terrain while the Appalachian Trail turns east and after navigating a series of ridges descends to postcard town of Norwich and the Connecticut River.  
War is no stranger to Vermont.  Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys, along with Benedict Arnold, captured Fort Ticonderoga in 1775.  The cannons they seized were used to break the British occupation of Boston.  The Green Mountain Boys also played a key role in the strategic victory at the Battle of Bennington, remembered each August 16 as a Vermont State Holiday. Both the Battle of Bennington and the Battle of Fort Ticonderoga actually took place in New York State.  Impress your friends by knowing that the northernmost land action of the Civil War took place in St. Albans, Vermont, about ten miles from the Canadian border.
As green as the Green Mountain State of Vermont is, New Hampshire and Maine are even greener, with the percentage of tree cover at 82%, 89% and 83%, respectively, as of 2005.  In contrast, the southern New England states of Connecticut and Massachusetts average 54%  forest cover.  Your impression of New Hampshire, however, won’t be of trees but rather the long stretches of above tree line hiking in the Presidential Range of the White Mountains National Forest, including Mount Washington where people have died every month of the year.  The weather warnings are meant to be taken seriously, as are the Leave No Trace imperatives.  It’s a fragile environment for both plants and people.   New Hampshire comes as a rude awakening to northbound hikers.  Several days after leaving the quintessential college town of Hanover, there’s a steep climb up Mount Moosilauke, a steep descent alongside Beaver Brook, and the ridiculously steep climbs over South and North Kinsman Mountains.  Imagine if you were tasked with laying out trail without having to consider soil erosion, since the glaciers removed what little there was.  That’s New Hampshire.  Just find a crease in the mountain and paint a few blazes on the rocks.  Never mind that the trail becomes a raging stream in the rain.  What doesn’t kill a hiker makes them stronger, right?  
The Appalachian Mountain Club operates a series of campgrounds and croo-staffed huts, many of which predate the Appalachian Trail.  Thru-hikers are forced into close contact with large numbers of hut-to-hut hikers, making for culture clash at times.  Staying at the huts is expensive and only limited work-for-stay is available, adding to the thru-hiker grousing.  Tourism is a major industry, and people have been riding the cog railway up Mt. Washington since 1868. There used to be hotels atop both Mooselauke and Mt. Washington. Thru-hikers are the new kids on the block.  For much of the way through New Hampshire, the AT follows older AMC trails.  The trails can be confusing and either a map or GPS navigation is helpful, if not essential.   Reaching Gorham, New Hampshire is a cause of celebration and chance for recovery before entering Maine in another 6.5 miles.
Iron mining, furnaces and forges were plentiful in New Hampshire, including in the Franconia area.  About 18 miles trail north of Hanover, the Trail crosses Ore Hill, once mined for lead, copper, zinc, and silver, and today a Superfund site for environmental remediation.  Revolutionary War action was limited to the rebels’ capture of British Fort William and Mary near the shipyards of Portsmouth, where Jone Paul Jones’ ship was built.  In spite of sharing a 275 mile border along the Connecticut River (actually the west bank of the river at mean low-water), New Hampshire and Vermont are politically quite different.  Vermont is bright blue while New Hampshire is reddish purple.  Both take their politics quite seriously!  
Most trail states greet northbound thru-hikers with notable obstacles.  Leaving Georgia, hikers face steep Courthouse Bald as a welcome to North Carolina.  Shortly after entering Virginia, hikers deal with Mount Rogers.  New Hampshire offers Mount Moosilauke.  Maine, however, wins the contest with Mahoosuc Notch and Mahoosuc Arm, 6.4 miles north of the New Hampshire border.  Mahoosuc Notch is a mile-wide notch over a 1,000 feet lower than the mountains on either side.  Since the glaciers receded, those mountains have entertained themselves by dropping chunks of rock, ranging in size from Volkswagen Beetles to school buses, into the Notch.  Hikers must find a route over, under and around the jumble of boulders.  Mahoosuc Stream flows under the rocks, audible but seldom visible, and even in July there are pockets of ice.  A guy I hiked with in 2000 carried a few airline bottles of Bourbon.  We celebrated midway through the Notch with Bourbon on the rocks on the rocks.  Trail mythology has it that Little People live under the rocks, subsisting on offerings made by hikers.   Climbing out of the Notch, up Mahoosuc Arm, offers challenges of its own, but the hiker eventually reaches Speck Pond, the highest lake in Maine with a healthy population of native brook trout.  I spent one of my most memorial nights on the trail there.  The Barefoot Sisters, Isis and Jackrabbit, prevailed upon a fly fisherman not to release his trout.  Dredged through crushed granola bars, stuffed with lemon sorrel, and sautéed lightly in olive oil, they were delicious.  The Sisters then led us in camp songs.  Yes, they really hiked barefooted and completed the Trail twice.  
The first 100 miles of Maine are just tough, from the New Hampshire border through the Bigelows.  Then it gets muddy, as it follows old Abenaki carry trails from pond to pond.  Carrying even a lightweight pack through the mud and muck is difficult enough, but imagine doing it pulling cannons and the equipment of war needed to lay siege to Quebec.  That’s what Colonel Benedict Arnold tried in the autumn of 1775.  He started with 1,100 troops and arrived with 600, greatly weakened and in no condition to fight.  It was a noble effort, and Arnold was rewarded with a promotion to brigadier general. The 100 miles, from the town of Monson to Abol Bridge on the boundary of Baxter State Park, is known as The Hundred Mile Wilderness.  It is pleasant hiking, although there are several rivers that need to be forded.  With little in the way of soil to absorb rainfall, the rivers can rise and fall quickly, making the crossings challenging at times.   The climb up Katahdin gains over 4,000’ in elevation over five miles and has the reputation of being the most difficult climb on the Appalachian Trail.  I’ll not dispute it.   
The forest products industry dominates the interior of Maine.  For the most part, the Appalachian Trail is within a narrow corridor of federally owned land surrounded by privately owned, well-managed timberlands.  One hundred years ago, there were over 100 paper mills in Maine.  Today only six remain, and the economic impact of the closings on towns like Millinocket has been severe.  The causes for the closings are complex, including relatively high energy costs, a reduction in demand for newsprint and uncoated stock, and a competitive international wood pulp market.   The wealthy communities of Down East Maine seem like a different state.  
The Maine Appalachian Trail Club manages and maintains 267 miles of the Appalachian Trail under extremely challenging conditions, with maintainers often driving long distances to even get to their assigned sections.  Techniques, like “flying” rocks using zip-lines on steroids, were pioneered by MATC.  No club takes greater pride in their work.  The lands of Maine became part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1652, even though those lands were not contiguous with Massachusetts.  Not until 1820, as part of the Missouri Compromise, when another free state was needed to balance the admission of Missouri as a slave state, did Maine gain its separate statehood.  Mainers are fiercely proud and independent, even by Vermont standards.  As difficult as hiking Maine can be — no state has more in the way of rocks, roots, and mud, or more aggressive mosquitoes and black flies — I always feel privileged to hike it.",,View Entry,"Feb 18, Sun",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583281,"I’m nearing the two-months-until-the-start-of-my-hike mark.  I play with my gear, just to see if I can detect a faint whiff of the Trail from hikes past.  Thanks to having a new pack this year, I can’t.  It rained two days this week, with gusty winds that render an umbrella useless, so I had an excuse to wear my trail rain suit on the walk to the office.  Walking in the rain with the right gear is quite pleasant. Some of my favorite days on the Trail have been rainy and foggy, with the muffled sounds and saturated colors.  My tent (Zpacks Solplex) can be set in the rain without the inside getting wet, and doesn’t gain much weight when wet.  
My dreams are now full of hiking, not literally if dreams can ever be said to be literal, but in terms of wandering over unusual terrain (like having to find a pathway through and over a lumberyard, a wooden Mahoosuc Notch?), exploring new things (singing the role of a buffoon in a Verdi opera), trying to do laundry while the machines keep vanishing, and meeting new creatures (some of whom are even human).  This is a part of recalibrating my life to the trail and happens before each hike.  When I’m in the city, my soul craves the trail, but the opposite is true as well. 
Many Appalachian Trail thru-hikers start with the intention of minimizing time in trail towns, partly for financial reasons, planning on quick “ins and outs” to buy groceries and perhaps to do laundry, with few overnight town stays.  It’s akin to a New Year’s resolution to eat and drink sensibly, to lose 10 pounds, and to visit the gym six days a week.   However noble the intention, few manage to keep their resolutions.  A compulsive numbers guy, Map Man, who often posts on WhiteBlaze.net, did a study of 240 northbound thru-hikers who completed the Trail, analyzing their on-line journals to determine where the hikers spent their nights during their hikes.  The northbound thru-hikes averaged 170 days, requiring 168 nights spent somewhere.  Fifty-three of those nights were either in motels, hostels or private homes.  In other words, nearly one-third of nights during a thru-hike were spent off the Trail.  I wondered how my hiking schedule would compare.  Excluding planned visits home, my planning schedule shows 170 nights, 49 (29%) of which would be off-trail.  So my hiking plan is quite aligned with Map Man’s findings.   As I’ve said before, I consider my schedule to be fiction once I start the hike.
Rather than seeing trail towns as a necessary evil, I embrace them and plan to enjoy them.  Toward this end, I’ve been asking myself what makes for a pleasant town visit?   First and foremost is my approach to trail towns.  I try to allow enough time to do the necessary chores (grocery shopping and laundry), enjoy as many meals as possible, to explore the town, to meet its citizens, to rest, and even to express gratitude to the townspeople for their welcome.  I like to get into town before lunch, spend the night, and leave after a large breakfast or even after lunch.  I plan two nights — a zero day — in towns that I particularly enjoy or when my body is screaming for a respite from hiking.  I’ve come up with a list of 17 criteria for evaluating trail towns.  I’ve assigned a maximum value to each, ranging from three for the most important ones down to one for nice, but unimportant, items  Using my memory of past visits, The Thru-Hikers’ Companion, Guthook’s Appalachian Trial Guide app, and Google Maps (for example, “museum near Front Royal, VA”), I evaluated 34 towns reasonably close to the Trail, towns that I have previously visited or am considering visiting this year.  The maximum points for a town across all categories is 36, and I expressed my evaluation of each town as a percentage of this maximum.  It is, of course, arbitrary and capricious, but doesn’t it sound scientific?  It’s my personal version of Trail Ethnology.  
Your criteria and weightings might well be different.  For example, if you hike with a canine companion, you might include veterinary services.  If you are vegan, you might assign a seriously high weighting to a health food store.  If you plan to dehydrate your own food and mail it yourself along the way, grocery stores may be unimportant to you.  You get the idea.
The whole concept is disingenuous and rendered even more so by the fact that in most cases, I don’t get to decide which towns to visit.  That decision is made for me by location, location, location, the Realtor’s mantra.  No matter what I think of Port Clinton, Pennsylvania (my lowest score at 33%), I can’t avoid visiting it, since it sits astride the Trail.  Fortunately, I have a friend who lives nearby who can rescue me for a couple of days.  Otherwise, the best things I can say about Port Clinton are that it is reasonably near Hamburg and that the Port Clinton Hotel has excellent French fries (not one of my rating criteria).  I avoided fantasy criteria, like sidewalks that slope gently downhill in both directions (found only in Escherville).  Scores of 90% or more earned an A, 80% a B, 70% a C, 60% a D, and less than 60% an E.  I was surprised by a couple of the results and also by the number of town museums and historical societies worth at least a brief visit.  
The Appalachian Trail Conservancy has an Appalachian Trail Community™ program “designed to recognize communities that promote and protect the Appalachian Trail.”  The program has several objectives, including engaging community citizens, recognizing and thanking communities that support the Trail and hikers, enhancing economic development, and aiding conservation planing.  One hope is that future maintaining club volunteers will emerge from these communities.  I applaud this program both as a concept and as a hiker.  Towns that have embraced the AT Community™ designation — 45 are currently listed on the ATC website — have become more welcoming to hikers and generally scored higher in my ranking.  My rankings, however, are personal and are from the rather flawed perspective of one hiker and probably have more to do with me than with the towns.  I’ll illustrate my approach using my only 100% score, Waynesboro, Virginia.
My Trail Town Criteria and Weighting
Proximity to the Trail - 3 points maximum
Proximity is not only geographical nearness to the Trail but also considers the ease of getting into and out of the town.  Waynesboro, Virginia, for example, is 4.5 miles west of the Trail, but has a cadre of volunteers to shuttle hikers into town and back to the Trail.  While I was waiting at the Kings Kettle Corn food truck at Rockfish Gap for the host of Belle Hearth Bed & Breakfast to pick me up, I was offered at least three rides into town.  Thus, Waynesboro earns three points.
A variety of lodging - 3 points maximum
To earn my three points, a town must offer lodging ranging from hostels to hotels to luxury.  The City of Waynesboro allows camping and hammocking in a park by the South River that includes a pavilion built by ALDHA with solar charging stations.  Grace Evangelical Lutheran operates a hostel Monday through Saturday nights, and a private hostel is also available.  The Quality Inn is convenient and reasonably priced, and Belle Hearth is a gem of a B&B!
A variety of local restaurants - 3 points maximum
The Ming Garden in Waynesboro is an enormous all-you-can-eat [AYCE] Asian buffet, including sushi, grill, and dessert.  Weasie’s Kitchen has classic diner fare, including an AYCE pancake special.  Scotto’s Italian was the site of one of my biggest pig-outs ever, at the end of a hike.  The Green Leaf Grill has excellent crab cakes and an amazing house-made cheesecake with expresso sauce.  A three, for sure.
Grocery store - 3 points maximum
Kroger’s is good for long-term resupply and right in downtown Waynesboro.
Laundromat - 3 points maximum 
There are at least two convenient coin laundromats in Waynesboro.
Pharmacy - 3 points maximum
There are four pharmacies in downtown Waynesboro.
Outfitter - 3 points maximum
Between the Trail and Waynesboro is Rockfish Gap Outfitters, offering full service and fuel by the ounce.
Pedestrian friendly - 2 points maximum
Downtown Waynesboro has sidewalks and crosswalks.
Compact downtown - 2 points maximum
Downtown Waynesboro is compact, with all services within a one square mile area.
Friendly, welcoming people - 2 points maximum
Since its designation as an Appalachian Trail Community™, the citizens of Waynesboro have gone out of their way to show me kindnesses, with special thanks to the ladies of the Waynesboro Heritage Foundation who arranged for me to tour the Plumb House, built circa 1802. 
Hair stylist or barber - 2 points maximum
There are several barber shops and styling salons in the downtown area.
Medical clinic - 2 points maximum
The Carilion Clinic Family Medicine practice in downtown Waynesboro offers a wide range of specialities, accepts most insurance and even has Saturday hours.
U.S. Post Office - 1 point maximum
The Waynesboro Post Office is in the heart of downtown.
Local coffee shop - 1 point maximum
There are three locally-owned coffee shops in downtown Waynesboro.
Library - 1 point maximum
The downtown Waynesboro Public Library has WiFI, 20 computer workstations, and wide array of current newspapers and magazines, along with friendly staff and comfortable seating.
Historical society or museum - 1 point maximum
The Waynesboro Heritage Foundation has excellent interpretive exhibits and knowledgable docents.  They found answers to my questions.  
An Episcopal Church - 1 point maximum
Visiting a church in a trail town is a great way to meet townspeople at their friendliest, and there’s at least a chance of being invited to Sunday supper! 
Waynesboro, Virginia has everything I want in a trail town, and I truly enjoyed my time there this past year, but would I want to live there?  No.  Waynesboro suffers by comparison to nearby Charlottesville (28 miles east), home of the University of Virginia, and Staunton (12 miles west), home to the American Shakespeare Center, Mary Baldwin University, and the Heifetz International Music Institute.  Charlottesville has a fine airport and daily train service to Washington, DC, seven craft beer breweries, and is the center of a burgeoning wine industry.  As much as I appreciate all that Waynesboro offers a hiker, in deciding where to retire, we had different criteria.  
My other A-rated trail towns were Franklin, North Carolina; Gatlinburg, Tennessee; Damascus, Virginia; and Manchester Center, Vermont.  Gatlinburg surprised me.  I haven’t visited there in decades, and it doesn’t appear to have lost its tackiness, but it does offer a full array of services for hikers.  It’s a relatively easy hitch from Newfound Gap, since anyone going west from the gap has to pass through Gatlinburg.  There is a shuttle service available, for a price, to return to the Trail, if magic does not provide.   
My other surprise was the town of Marion, Virginia, eight miles west from the Visitors’ Center of Mount Rogers National Recreation Area, accessible via a shuttle operated by the Marion Transit Authority.  Marion lacks only an outfitter and a laundromat, although one is available at the hiker-friendly Travel Inn.  The General Francis Marion Hotel has been restored to its 1920’s splendor and is reasonably priced, and their Speakeasy Restaurant menu looks quite tempting.  It might be worth doing a little hand laundry for the luxury.  I rank Marion a solid B and look forward to exploring it.  I’ve visited Marion once before, but never as a hiker, and that can make all the difference.  
Aside from Port Clinton, Pennsylvania, I awarded failing grades to Andover, Caratunk and Stratton, Maine and Glascow, Virginia.  All are very small towns with limited services, but are convenient to the Trail.  They do the best with what they have and make an effort to welcome hikers. 
The southern trail towns averaged 80% on my peculiar scale, while the northern towns averaged 64%.  This is partly due to the southern trail being primarily within National Forest and National Parks, so that the towns frequented by hikers are destinations visited by most thru-hikers.  There are many more towns convenient to the Trail in the north, dispersing the thru-hiker population, and because of attrition, there are fewer thru-hikers in the north to support town services.  With the ever increasing number of hikers and the popularity of the AT Community™ program, I expect town services to hikers to only improve.  
All this talk about trail towns has made me anxious to return to the woods.",,View Entry,"Feb 24, Sat",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583552,"It just struck me that with all the prehike writing I’ve done up until now, I have yet to write about hiking itself.  I would like to remedy that.  Walking ranks right up there with food and sex as one of life’s great pleasures, the greatest of all being love.  I’ve written quite a bit about food, and I have no intention of writing about love or sex, so walking it is.  
Whenever I’ve needed to puzzle anything out, whether it’s a plot twist in something I’m trying to write, or back in my science days, trying to fathom what could explain my observations, I’ve turned to walking.  Walking suspends time and exposes time as illusion.  Why something as obviously metronomic as walking should have that effect on me, I haven’t a clue.  Perhaps walking substitutes a natural rhythm that’s as old as bipedalism for the tick-tock of modern civilization.  Walking is just physical enough to occupy the body, but except on difficult terrain, doesn’t require much mindfulness.  So my mind is free to float off, make new connections, and sometimes return with answers that have previously eluded me.  It’s like directed dreaming. 
Our ancestors were mostly bipedal four million years ago, and Homo erectus was fully bipedal 1.95 million years ago, so it’s hardly an overstatement to say that walking is in our genes.  By contrast, the oldest known evidence of calendars dates to about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, at the start of the Neolithic period, the beginning of farming and the domestication of crops and animals.  The oldest clocks, possibly shadow clocks, go back only 4,000 to 5,000 years. We can blame the Sumerians of 2,000 BC for our sexagesimal (base 60) system.  
About the time we start school, we are introduced to timelines, as portrayals of the history of European explorations, geological time periods, and the history of life on Earth.  We quickly absorb the concept that time is linear, having a beginning on the left and an end on the right.  Big Bang to whimpering loneliness, with ravenous supermassive black holes in between.  Perhaps later in our education, we wrap our pea brains around Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity and the concept of time dilation, or we are exposed to Nietzsche’s doctrine of eternal recurrence or Buddhist thought.  We might even have gained a sense of circular time or spiraling time, in the sense of Gregory of Nyssa, proceeding from glory to glory.  At some point, we become aware that not all minutes, hours, years and decades are of equal length.  A twenty-year old looking at a sixty-year old sees an unfathomable gulf.  From the opposite perspective, it is the merest blip. As a kid, waiting for Christmas or summer vacation was eternal.   Walking restores the subjectivity of time and frees us from the tyranny of clock and calendar.
Humans are not the fastest animals, but we are built for endurance in running and walking, in part because we sweat and can thermoregulate better than most species.  Walking is what we do and it was our primary mode of transportation until we domesticated animals.  With each technological advance, we’ve gotten lazier to the extent that we now think of running and walking as exercise, something that we do instead of doing something else.  Walking is done on treadmills and elliptical trainers while watching TV or playing with our phones.  Our communities are designed for cars, with pedestrians and bicyclists receiving only secondary consideration.  Roundabouts have become fashionable in urban street design, but have you ever tried to navigate one on bicycle?  Burlington, Vermont where I now live is very pedestrian and bicycle friendly, and becoming more so.  Living downtown, I find that I use our car once a week for grocery shopping, and quite literally walk more miles than I drive.  I don’t have to go out with the intent of walking for exercise.  It’s simply part of my life.  Even so, I sometimes take long walks for the fun of it, along the lakefront bicycle path or through the University of Vermont campus to Centennial Woods, which I think of as Pooh’s Hundred Acre Wood, even though it is only 65 acres.    
When the doctors told me to stop running in 2002 because of progressive osteoarthritis in my knees, they consoled me with, “Save your knees for walking and hiking.”  At least I still had that.  My knees continued to degenerate and after they ended my 2013 thru-hike attempt, I explored total knee replacements, getting as far as choosing the joints and discussing anesthesia.  Before we scheduled the surgery, my surgeon went to a conference and came back convinced that stem cell cartilage regeneration was less than five years away from having a standard protocol and insurance coverage.  He wanted to postpone my replacements until then, offering me steroid injections and massive off-loading braces.  The braces stopped providing relief in 2016, while I was hiking on the Long Trail in Vermont, and I approached the orthopedic department at UVM, ready for new knees.  They insisted upon an evaluation by a physical therapist first, something no other doctor ever suggested.  I met with the physical therapist (thank you, Michelle!) four times in November and December of that year, and the results of the simple repetitive motions she prescribed seem miraculous to me.  I’ve continued the exercises, and my knees are pain free for the first time in many years.  Oh, the joy of walking without pain and without those &$^% braces!  It only took me twenty years to figure out that the key for me is keeping the quadricep muscles stretched out.  I can do that on the Trail.  
I have heard it said (meaning that people say it, but I don’t believe it) that a person’s walking gait is unchanged for long periods of time and is as unique as a fingerprint.  Certainly, we’ve all had the experience of recognizing who is approaching by the sound of their footfalls. Yet I know my walking gait has changed.  As a young man, I had a pronounced spring to my step and would sometimes imagine myself as a springbok, pronking over the Veldt.  On my first few Appalachian Trail hikes, before I adopted hiking sticks, I would gallump down hills, and even ran the gentle 16 mile downhill from Tri-Corner Knob Shelter to Davenport Gap in the Smokies, propelled onward by the vision of one of Mountain Mama’s burgers.  As my arthritis progressed, my gait shortened, and especially on the downhills, my cadence slowed.  I also started practicing quiet walking, both to increase the odds of seeing wildlife, and to reduce the impact on my knees and hips.  The physical therapist taught me to keep a slight bend in my knees, to make full use of my natural shock absorbers.   When the sidewalks here are icy, like this morning, I shorten my stride even more.  It’s gotten so that my gait is no longer automatic, but something I decide upon based on conditions.
Watch people as they hike, especially from behind.  Does their pack bounce up and down or sway from side to side?  Or does it glide down the trail, with little wasted energy?  Can you hear their footfalls, even when there aren’t autumn leaves or snappy twigs on the ground, or are they walking silently with a gentle heel-toe rhythm?  Efficient, quiet walking is a learned technique.  I started hiking with full leather boots, believing them necessary with my pack weight at the time, and essentially s*^%-kicked my way down the trail.  Switching to trail runners means having to pay a bit more attention to foot placement. I even tried a pair of Vibram FiveFinger Shoes:  http://vibramfivefingers.com.  They are like lightweight gloves for your feet, with a separate compartment for each toe.  Once I learned how to get the right toe in the right compartment, they were quite comfortable.  I tried them on a long day hike in Myakka River State Park when I lived in Florida.  I quickly learned to place my steps carefully and to avoid stepping on branches or anything that was hard.  There are no rocks there, fortunately.  Blisters were not a problem, but I had to stop every few minutes to pry live oak acorns from between my toes.  Live oak acorns are rather small, under 1/2” in diameter, and between the toes, they hurt.  I haven’t tried them on the Appalachian Trail, not even as camp shoes.  They take too long to put on when I need to pee at night, and the Vivo Barefoot Runners I now use in camp actually weigh about the same.  And no one laughs at me.
Quiet walking, especially in the dawn’s early light, is a wonderful way to observe your fellow creatures.  Standard wisdom is to make noise as you hike, particularly to alert bears to your presence.  Black bears along the Appalachian Trail know what people are and how we smell.  It’s hard to surprise one unless you approach from downwind.  If you are alert to bear sign, like scratch marks on trees and fresh scat, you will know when a bear is around, and if you are downwind, you may well smell them.  I personally enjoy watching bears before they become aware of me and run. If you encounter the rare bear who is habituated to humans and associates us with food, I’m not sure that the tinkle of a bear bell or a shouted “Hey, bear!” is such a good idea.  Encountering a bear or even seeng a bear’s butt running away is not common, except perhaps in Shenandoah National Park.  I have hiked through SNP half a dozen times and have always seen at least one bear and as many as six.  I hope you are as fortunate.
Deer are common sightings along the trail, and except in the fall rut when the bucks can be somewhat aggressive, they are more concerned with their browsing than with passing humans.  My goal is to walk by without the deer leaping away.  In Myakka River State Park, where there hasn’t been hunting in 80-some years, I’ve had flocks of turkeys cross the trail around me, and one deer even approach to lick the salt off my leg when I was resting at the base of an oak.  I treasure these among my St. Francis moments.   
Some backpackers find hiking boring and distract themselves with music or ebooks.   I used to carry a small Sony Walkman but I found that I only used it on easy terrain in miserable weather, when distraction was welcome.  In October, 1999, I hiked from Greenwood Lake, New York to Williamstown, Massachusetts.  The hiking is relatively easy on the east bank of the Hudson and on the fifth or sixth day of the hike I awoke to an overcast, drizzly day, and succumbed to the headphones.   As I approached the The Nature Conservancy’s Pawling Nature Reserve, I saw a bear cross the trail on a ridge in front of me.  I thought she went well with the Mozart horn concerto I was listening to.  A few minutes later, the French horns sounded terrible and I ripped the headphones off, only to discover that the cacophonous sound persisted.  I was hearing a fox hunt from the valley below.  A few minutes later, two Great Danes came bounding up followed by two women shouting, “Be careful, they hate men!”  One dog stood with his paws on my shoulders, licking my face, and the other nuzzled my butt.  No, the women may have hated men, but their dogs had no problem with me.  I found the Trail plenty interesting that day without the need for music.  I no longer carry earbuds, not even for my iPhone.  I will use the cellphone, however, to read at night and to keep this journal current.
The treadway of the Appalachian Trail is sometimes described as rocks, roots and mud, but there are isolated sections of splendid walkway, following old post roads, the C&O Canal towpath, and even in Connecticut a part of an old harness racing track.  No special techniques of walking are needed for the good sections, but I can offer a few hints for the rest of the trail.  First, lift up your feet a little higher than you normally would, to avoid tripping over the rocks and roots and to minimize toe blisters from kicking them.  That becomes automatic for me after a couple of days and at least one blackened toenail.  Look for footprints in the mud to gauge how slippery it is, and in Vermont, if the trail looks glossy black and you don’t see footprints, don’t step there!  It’s apt to be a bottomless soupy quagmire that will try its hardest to steal your shoes.  There are sections of trail, even outside of Pennsylvania, that are carpeted in nasty little unstable rocks that can’t be walked around.  Navigating those rock gardens is a challenge and there are two basic approaches.   The first is to take it slow, testing each rock for steadiness before committing yourself, making full use of your hiking poles.  The second is to rock dance, setting a sight line by a distant tree or boulder, and moving quickly across the rock field, trusting your feet to dance across, without committing your weight to any one rock.  If my knees are free and nimble, I prefer the latter.  I no longer picture myself as a springbok, but I could imagine myself as an elephant in a tutu.  Gotta Dance!",,View Entry,"Mar 03, Sat",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583808,"It’s still seven weeks before I start my hike, but I’m already experiencing a series of “last time I’ll do that before my hike” moments.  They always take me by surprise and leave me a little disconcerted, as though I’m flitting between two worlds, the world where I am respectable, married, church-going, and home-owning and the world where I am homeless, straggly-bearded, dirt-encrusted, perpetually-hungry and peripatetic.  Will the real Ken/Sugarfoot please stand up?  Of course, I’m neither all that respectable at home nor so despicable on the Trail.  
I took the car out on Saturday to run a few errands, including visiting the discount barber shop to buy the last hair products I would need before my hike.  It’s rare that I run out of shampoo and conditioner at the same time, but when it happens, it’s definitely worth the drive for a 20% discount.  On the Trail, I’ll trade these things and my blow dryer for a small square of pack towel that I’ll run through my hair each morning to remove a little of the accumulated oils and dirt.  I also stopped at the gas station, certainly the last time the Outback will need fuel before my hike.  I won’t miss the smell of gasoline and exhaust fumes.  That reminds me that I need to schedule the annual car inspection due next month.  I’ve started a things-to-do-before-I-leave checklist, a pre-hike bucket list.
This past Tuesday was Vermont Town Meeting Day and my last election before my hike.  Burlington is too large for an actual meeting, but we went to the polls to elect a mayor, city councilor, school commissioner, approve the school budget and approve the issuance of bonds for capital improvements.  We also voted on a series of advisory questions ranging from global climate change, basing F-35’s at Burlington International Airport, and increasing the age for the purchase of tobacco products.  Every aspect of municipal life here is endlessly debated and highly contested.  Apathy is not a problem.  Indeed, citizens are required to hold at least two contradictory opinions on every subject and voice them simultaneously.  I won’t miss politics on the Trail.  I haven’t decided  yet if I will studiously avoid news during my hike.  It’s hard to go cold turkey from the news but an interesting exercise, a reminder of how little the things we worry about actually affect our lives.  
I trimmed my toenails last Saturday morning, hardly newsworthy, and I’ll trim them again before leaving, but it made me aware that I actually have all ten toenails, a sure sign that it’s time for a hike.  How many toenails will I lose on this hike?  Will I achieve a personal best and lose all ten?  I’ve never lost my big toenails before; that could be exciting.  If you don’t know, it’s common for hikers as well as long-distance runners to lose toenails.  A couple of days after I stub a toe against a rock or a root, the nail goes black and eventually falls off.  It doesn’t hurt and so far, there’s always been a new nail underneath.  I’ve been wearing my hiking boots or trail runners as everyday shoes here, so maybe that won’t happen this time.  My toes are already nicely calloused.  
At the grocery store last week, I bought the last Vitamin D that I’ll use before my hike.  My doctor doesn’t support using multi-vitamins and agrees that I can suspend my vitamins as well as a minor prescription medicine during my hike.  The only drug I’ll be carrying will be Naproxen sodium, Aleve.  It works much better for me than the ubiquitous Vitamin I, Ibuprofen, that most hikers use.  
Does anyone else feel caught between two worlds in the weeks before a hike?  A part of me feels like I’ve already started the hike.  The rest of me doesn’t quite believe that it will ever really happen.  This isn’t the way it is supposed to be in the Hero’s Journey.  In mythology, there is either a portal or a threshold.  Going through it or crossing it starts the great adventure, and it’s not a dragged out affair.  The Wizard shows up and more-or-less commands that it’s time to leave the Shire, or Lucy stumbles through the back of a Wardrobe into Narnia.  The portal or the boundary is a two-way street.  Odysseus, Bilbo and Lucy all return to the peace of their respective hearths.   For Odysssus and Bilbo, the time they spent in their grand journeys has passed at home at well.  Time spent in Narnia didn’t register in England.  I tried playing with the Narnia concept in my writing, having characters step out of time, do whatever they do, and step back into time at the exact moment they left, with no memory of having left, except that over time, memory leaks occur.  I haven’t gotten it to work, and Einstein would not approve at any rate.  
If I were to leave Earth in a spaceship and travel at near light velocity, my watch would continue to tick and I would experience time no differently than if I had remained on Earth.   If I managed to find my way back to Earth, not at all a sure thing for one so directionally challenged,  I would find that far more time had elapsed on Earth than I had experienced.  My friends would all be very old and probably quite dead.  On the other hand, if my spaceship did nothing but orbit the Sun at a stately pace while the entire Earth zoomed off at near light speed before returning to its placid solar orbit, I would be the very old person while my friends would have scarcely aged.  I can conceive of no way for me to step out of time, have a grand adventure, and step back into time at the same moment I departed.  C. S. Lewis was not a physicist.  
My hiking speed won’t be relativistic, so I’m not worried about that.  I would, however, welcome the illusion that the Appalachian Trail is a different dimension, where time is once again in joint, where I can welcome the sprite instead of cursing them.",,View Entry,"Mar 09, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584309,"I was told recently that I should act my age.  I fear that I didn’t respond in an age appropriate manner and certainly not gracefully, unless derision and a raised middle finger pass for eloquence these days.  At least I refrained from hissing like an irate cat and baring my fangs or suggesting what they might do with various appendages and orifices.  But I thought it, so the sin be mine.  It is good that I didn’t have children, because I would have been the sort of grandpa that children love but parents caution against.  “Don’t listen to anything he says.  He’s just trying to be different and he wants to make you that way too.  He never did fit in.  He doesn’t care about anyone’s feelings but his own and does exactly what he wants to do.  He’s dangerous he is, and shouldn’t be allowed to be around little ones.”  
Fortunately, I value of the opinions of dog and cats over those of most people.  Dogs like me, and cats find me amusing, so I must be good for something.    A belly rub or a scritch behind the ear is not too dear of a price for needed approbation.  If I can be of value to these magnificent and, in the case of cats, superior creatures, then for a bit longer I can push off the start of a sittin’ and a rockin’, drool running down my chin.  
Ageism is rampant in our society, even in enlightened Vermont.  When people ask what I do, and I answer, “I’m retired,” that usually ends the conversation.  They have found my pigeonhole, and whatever came before is irrelevant to the present.  Whether I had been a groundbreaking surgeon, a Broadway producer, a deckhand on a tugboat (I can actually claim that profession, blessedly briefly), or a tax partner in a CPA firm (alas, sadly true) is all in the past.  What I did is not what I do, and what I do is, well, nothing.  So nothing is what I am.  But I still have my own teeth and can inflict a nasty wound.  I can still write deeply nested sentences of tortured syntax.  
My age rage, strangely enough, brings me back to the Appalachian Trail.  I have hiked the Trail in Vermont several times, as either the Appalachian Trail or the Long Trail, there being at least a mental distinction for me.  Hiking Vermont northbound, the first endless climb is Stratton Mountain, named for Major Isaac Stratton, Esq. who showed great valor in the Revolutionary Battle of Bennington and founded the town of South Williamstown, Massachusetts, where he died in 1789.   The mountain, however, predates Major Stratton and was called Manickmung in the Algonquian language of the Mahican, meaning “place where the mountain heaps up.” For the hiker at least, this description takes precedence over colonial history, and it makes complete sense.  On a clear day, the views from the 55-foot fire tower on the summit are staggering, extending 200 miles over 360 degrees, to Mt. Marce and Whiteface in the Adirondacks; Mt. Washington in the White Mountains; south through the Berkshires to the Catskills; and through a gap, even Wachusett Mountain overlooking Boston.  Manickmung is a sacred place in Trail lore, where James Taylor conceived of the Long Trail in 1909, and 12 years later, Benton MacKaye had his vision of a giant striding the length of the Appalachians.  
The Stratton fire tower and the two warden cabins near the tower base were entered in the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.  The newer log cabin, built in 1970, is a generous 80 square feet.  Since 1996, the cabin has served as the summer home of the Green Mountain Club Stratton Summit caretakers, Hugh and Jeanne Joudry.  They also served as fire watchers there from 1968 to 1979, so it is no exaggeration to claim that they are a part of the mountain.  I have had the good fortune to meet them twice, and on the second time, Jeanne invited me into their cabin for a cup of tea and to see her paintings, which are described as abstract.  They don’t strike me that way but rather as a myopic vision of the mountains and trees, swirled by rain and wind into mystic patterns.  If I’m fortunate enough to meet her again this year, I’m hoping I can persuade her to choose a work for me to purchase.  Hugh is a wood sculptor.  His work reminds me of African stone sculpture.  They have had joint shows, and now that I’m in Vermont, I will search them out.  Hugh is the reason for my telling this story.  Yes, there is a reason. 
Jeanne shared with me that Hugh is related to the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, whose advice for aging includes:
     Do not go gentle into that good night,
     Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
     Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
So act my age, be damned!  Feel free to blow past me as you race down the trail.  I’ll happily breath your dust.  Brag about the miles you have hiked today.  I bet I’ve seen more, the flower in the crannied wall, eternity in a chestnut.  
One of my clients put it to me quite simply twenty-five year ago.  “If you want to keep walking, keep walking.”  It’s as simple as that.  Don’t stop to listen to the naysayers.  If I can’t walk, I’ll crawl and claw my way up the mountains.  The grave is patient and will gladly wait a few more years, and a few more after that.",,View Entry,"Mar 17, Sat",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584802,"My last entry wandered a bit, starting with my reaction to being age-typed and ending on Mt. Stratton where I met caretaker Hugh Joudry, a relative of Dylan Thomas.  I enjoy wandering, both literally when hiking and also in the free associations of my mind.  I enjoy being surprised with where I end up and wondering how I got there.  
The photo of the Welsh sheep in my last entry brought to mind a favorite Dylan Thomas story, from his forward to The Collected Poems:  “I read somewhere of a shepherd who, when asked why he made, from within fairy rings, ritual observances to the moon to protect his flocks, replied: “I’d be a damn’ fool if I didn’t!””  
It’s a story in a single sentence, in prose easily as complex as my own.  I laugh at the shepherd but then look at my own life, on and off the trail, and all of the little rituals I observe that may or may not have meaning, but that I persist in because “I’d be a damn’ fool if I didn’t.”  Does my religious worship have any more significance than a dog walking in circles three times before lying down?  At least the dog gets a soft place to sleep.  I don’t believe that my prayer, or even my singing in the choir, purchases a farthing of salvation.  It only makes me nostalgic for coins gone by.  The Canadians stopped minting pennies in 2012.  The British farthing, worth one quarter of a penny and 1/960 of a pound sterling, was withdrawn in 1961.  A recent plan by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to drop the one penny and two penny coins was met by fierce opposition and has been withdrawn.  I say, “Bravo!” to that.  It’s these silly little rituals and ridiculous tokens that define life and imbue it with meaning.   I find it infinitely sad that more and more undergraduates are seeking career paths instead of majors that excite their souls.  Long after our science and engineering has been surpassed and forgotten, our art will live on, that is, if anyone still cares.  
As the starting date of my thru-hike approaches,  I observed one of my classic pre-hike rituals this week, The Tweaking of the Gear.  It involves carefully considering each row on my gear spreadsheet, weighing the utility of an item and its harmony with other items against its weight.  The one item that stood out was my bear canister at two pounds and the extra pound of backpack required to carry it comfortably.  I asked myself what the odds were of encountering a rogue black bear with a taste for Little Debbies who could not be defeated by using bear boxes, bear poles, or cables when available or by properly hanging my food ten feet off the ground and four feet from the trunk or nearest limb, preferably following the Pacific Crest Method so there’s no line for the bear to snag. Then I thought of how rarely I’ve found the perfect tree for a proper hang, there being only one of them along the entire Appalachian Trail, and how seldom I’ve managed to throw a line over the aimed-for branch.  Especially in the dark.  When it’s raining.  I think of the poor bear, who, through my carelessness or ineptness, might seek out Oatmeal Creme Pies or Swiss Rolls in the future, possible endangering another hiker, or worse, being euthanized as a problem bear.  This is not a sin I would care to carry to the Pearly Gates, especially if St. Peter proves to have an ursine nature.  So the canister stays.
I did manage, through my ritual, to eliminate a little weight from my pack.  The lid of the Bearicade canister is secured with three quarter-turn fasteners that can easily be unlocked with a quarter.  Last year, I found that when my hands were cold in the morning, I was utterly incapable of managing that task.  It is so frustrating to have food at hand but be unable to access it, which is hopefully what a bear experiences coming upon a canister.  So this year, I decided to carry a squat 1/2” flathead screwdriver with a padded handle.  Unfortunately, it weighs nearly 2 ounces and creates the illusion that I can use tools.  Inspiration struck yesterday morning and I visited the hardware store, something that always makes me feel so butch.  For 43 cents, I purchased a 2” diameter washer that works perfectly and can easily be manipulated even with gloves on.  Weight savings — 1.3 ounces.  
Many years ago, I was caught in a violent hailstorm on Mt. Rogers in Southwest Virginia, the half-inch pellets blowing sideways, leaving my face windburned and bruised.  Since then I’ve carried a light weight balaclava in addition to a fleece cap.  The cap is the first thing I put on when it’s chilly and I often sleep in it.  The two together weigh 2.5 ounces.  I’ve been following a northbound thru-hiker this year, Hungry Cat, also on Trail Journals.  He has a great sense of humor and has managed to maintain a positive outlook in spite of a series of late winter storms.  Have I mentioned that a sense of humor is essential gear?  He loves a product called a Buff (www.buffusa.com).   The Buff is a seamless fabric tube measuring 20.5 x 9.75 inches weighing 1.4 ounces.  It can be worn as a neckerchief, balaclava, headband, cap, pirate bandana or any of eight other fashionable configurations.  I was skeptical that any one thing capable of doing so many things could do any of them well, but based on Hungry Cat’s endorsement, I ordered one, permethrin-treated, stink resistant and UV blocking.  After playing with it for a day now, I am a convert.  It could potentially eliminate my bandana as well.  
Saving 2.6 ounces may not seem like a lot, but it is the equivalent of two Little Debbie Oatmeal Creme Pies.  Yum!  The total weight of my pack, exclusive of consumables, is now 14 pounds, 14 ounces, not ultralight but still respectable.
My other accomplishment this week was having the battery replaced in my iPhone 6S.  I noticed that the battery life was become erratic and that apps seemed to running slower.  Problem solved.",,View Entry,"Mar 24, Sat",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585207,"This question is directed you, my readers.  I’ll let you know what I’ve already downloaded for this hike, but really, I would like your suggestions.  Think of it as a wine pairing.  What books would go well with a flip-flop thru-hike?  Do we want a nice fruity, easy-drinking red, like a Beaujolais, that we can quaff instead of sip?   An Oregon Pinot Noir, elegant but simple?  A serious Burgundy?  Since I’ll be hiking at the peak of summer, perhaps a Viognier from the Languedoc served with a seafood paella cooked over the campfire?  Only if you are catering.  Which e-books would you carry?
There will be plenty of time for reading. My work-of-fiction hiking schedule has me reaching Manchester Center, Vermont on the summer solstice, June 21, when the sun will rise at 5:09 and won’t set until 8:42.  That’s 15-1/2 hours of daylight, not even considering twilight, and far too long for me to spend it hiking.  By then I’ll know the hikers around me well, and while I’m sure the conversation will be scintillating, there are bound to be long pauses when a book would be nice.  The summer solstice is also known as Hike Naked Day.   I won’t be.  Hiking naked is a cardinal violation of the sixth Leave No Trace Principal — Respect Wildlife — not to mention the seventh — Be Considerate of Other Visitors.  
My reading tastes are catholic, so nothing you might suggest would offend me.  I tend to read more fiction than nonfiction, but I have read a good deal of American history, particularly the 17th and 18th centuries and the Spanish-American War, when we first became an imperial nation.  My frequent visits to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia while serving on the board of Appalachian Trial Conference/Conservancy piqued my curiosity about John Brown and the abolitionist period.  I’m fortunate to live only a short walk from both the Fletcher Free Library of the City of Burlington and the Bailey/Howe Library at the University of Vermont, so whatever my taste at the moment, I can indulge it in depth.  I enjoy exploring rabbit holes.  I read a lot of new fiction.  Since our house fire in 2009, I’ve tended to rely upon libraries and downloads rather than buying hard copies.  Books have lost a sense of permanence for me.
In penance for having quoted the first line of Leo Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina without having read the book, I have downloaded it.  It is a personal failing, but Tolstoy bores me.  I thoroughly enjoy Dostoevsky, particularly The Idiot and The Brothers Karamazov, and I’ve read Herman Melville’s Moby DIck repeatedly.  On the other hand, reading Tolstoy’s War and Peace felt longer than the fifteen years the book spans. The Pevear and Volokhonsky translation in hardback weighs nearly four pounds, making it excellent for pressing eggplant slices.  I can take Anna in only small doses, but she will be joining me on this hike.  
My favorite writers include Hermann Hesse, especially Narcissus and Goldmund and The Glass Bead Game, and Flannery O’Connor.  I named Enoch, Kansas after her character Enoch Emery.  A blessed few of you may have recognized the caption of last week’s photo as an homage to Oscar Wilde, whose fate was sealed by a small envelope left by the Marquess of Queensbury at Oscar’s club proclaiming, “For Oscar Wilde posing somdomite (sic).”
I’ve also downloaded Dylan Thomas’ The Collected Poems since he seems to be on my mind of late.   I am incapable of reading poetry unless I’m in the woods and time slows down.  Before cellphones made the weight of books immaterial, I sought out thin books.  I carried Walt Whitman’s 1855 first edition of Leaves of Grass for years, reading and rereading the 12 poems it contains, until finally they opened up to me.  Walt’s final edition in 1892 ballooned to over 300 poems and never would have found its way into my pack.   Wendell Berry’s Sabbath poems beg to be read outdoors.
In general, I avoid mysteries and suspense novels on my hikes.  There are enough real things going bump in the night that I don’t need to be scaring myself.  Dame Agatha Christie and P. D. James, Baroness James of Holland Park, are exceptions.  
I also have the e-Book of Common Prayer and Lectionary on my iPhone and try to say the daily offices, but often fail in that.  The Episcopal Book of Common Prayer traces its roots to 1549 and the artful editing of Thomas Cramner.   He managed to keep his head through various regime changes, but he was finally done to a turn at the stake in 1556.  I’ve been accused of grounding my faith in aesthetics, and perhaps it is so.  Words like inestimable and unfeignedly are simply divine.  The 12 modes of Gregorian Chant excite my soul.
So, dear friends, what shall I read on this hike?  Please make your nominations in the guest book.  One month to go, and I’m getting antsy.",,View Entry,"Mar 29, Thu",0

This has been a week of celebration following my second retirement on Monday.  I started cutting back my work hours in 2013 and fully retired from the CPA firm I helped found in 2016.  We moved to Burlington and I had no intention of ever working again.  Last year, I even engaged a local CPA firm to prepare our own tax returns.  They were falling behind. I knew their software and agreed to help them out.  In a weak moment, I even agreed to work half-time this tax season.  Never again!  They are lovely, kind people, even the office dogs are nice people (this being Vermont), but having adjusted to retirement, I found that working just sucked the joy out of my life.  I couldn’t get to the Y as often as I liked.  I couldn’t go for daily walks.  My sleep was disrupted by tax season dreams, which are kind of like the film Groundhog Day - staircases that never end and don’t lead to the right floor or losing my car in a parking lot that stretches on for infinity.  It’s over now and I am enjoying a second round of post-retirement euphoria!  
I wish I could say that my euphoria coincides with the end of winter.  There are a few snowdrops and crocuses (or croci, if you prefer) blooming.  The black vultures, starlings, and robins have returned.  But it is still wicked cold down by the lakefront when the wind is factored in.  We actually had a trace of snow yesterday and more is forecast for this afternoon.  Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow this year, promising six more week of winter.  It’s now been nine weeks.  Will Jadis the White Witch, the Ice Queen, reign forever in Narnia and Aslan never return?  My faith is severely tested.
I had a client who was a retired Reform rabbi.  We became friends, and among other things, he taught me how to swear some in Yiddish.  He also taught me a lot about how to handle client inquiries.  First, he said, never answer a question with an answer, unless it is a simple factual matter.  And never, he cautioned, answer a question with a question, because they will think you don’t know the answer.  Instead, tell a story.  It’s nice if the story relates to their problem, but it doesn’t have to, because they will think it does.  They will go away thinking that you are very wise.  Rabbi Sandy also taught me the German word Schadenfreude, meaning finding pleasure in another’s misfortune.  I knew the concept, but not the word.  If Sandy were here now, I would ask him if there were a word to describe learning a lesson from another’s misfortune, with empathy for their pain.  I asked a German scholar today after morning prayer, and he responded, “The Germans would never allow such a thing,” but suggested Mit Freude Lernen, roughly joyful learning.  It’s not quite what I had in mind.
A fellow thru-hiker this year, Hungry Cat, started in Georgia on February 26 and has been moving very well, reaching Damascus, Virginia last Friday in under two months.  I did that in 2005 when the Appalachian Trail Conservancy held its biennial meeting in nearby Johnson City, Tennessee.  It’s pushing, especially since Hungry Cat did it in winter.  Unfortunately, Hungry Cat has been in Damascus for the past week, nursing some nasty heel blisters.  I feel his pain both from the blisters and also in spending a week in Damascus.  I arrived a week ahead of schedule in 2005, and like Hungry Cat, got to know the town entirely too well, even to the point of visiting Frank’s Barber Shop and getting one of the two approved haircuts — either short on top and short on the sides or long on top and short on the sides.  If you’ve ever watched Andy of Mayberry, think Floyd’s Barber Shop.  One bright spot for Hungry Cat is the cinnamon buns at Mojo’s, new since I was there.  I don’t know Hungry Cat, but after following him for two months, I feel like he is a friend, so I find myself walking on the balls of my feet to avoid putting pressure on my heels.  He blames his blisters on the “waterproof” boots that he’s worn up until now.  Even though he’s used liner socks, changed socks regularly and aired out his feet at breaks, moisture builds up in boots with membranes like Gore-Tex, and they are slow to dry.  The boots become foot saunas.  Hungry Cat is switching to breathable trail runners, something I did 15 years ago.  But guess what?  I had convinced myself to start my hike in three weeks wearing my “waterproof” boots that I’ve worn for two winters here.  I wanted some protection against the rocks of Pennsylvania.  Hungry Cat’s tsorris (thank you, Rabbi Sandy) is the lesson I needed.  Three days ago, I switched my green Superfeet insoles from my boots to my lightweight Scarpa Rapid approach shoes and slipped them on with my favorite FITS socks.   I have a pair of LL Bean Wicked Good Sheepskin Slippers that I wear indoors, and that’s what it felt like.  Oh, happy feet!  So, Hungry Cat, I’m sorry for your pain, and I’ve learned from it. There must be a word for this.  
I also realized this past week that Guthook’s Guides for the Appalachian Trail app had not updated user comments since mid-January.  The user comments are sometimes the best information about town services, dry springs, and reliable shuttle drivers since the comments are posted in almost real time.  I emailed Ryan Linn “Guthook” and even though it was Easter weekend, he offered several suggestions that didn’t work and finally suggested logging out and logging back in, the digital equivalent of banging a TV on the side of its console, which did.  We were both surprised and I, at least, was delighted not only to have the app fully functioning again but also by Guthook’s incredible service.",,View Entry,"Apr 06, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586578,"Definitely an odd week of conflicting emotions as I make my last preparations.  I was going to write “final preparations,” but that sounds too hospice-like.  My husband flew out on Tuesday for a week in Georgia visiting family, so I’ve experienced a bit of the loneliness that he’ll face for much longer when I’m off on my hike.  It’s hard to get motivated to cook food for just one, so I’ve been eating salads and stir-fries.  My guilt has manifested in predictable ways: cleaning out the refrigerator, doing a deep cleaning of our condo, and restocking the pantry. The weather has been mild, actually reaching the upper-40’s, so walking has been very pleasant.  In addition to occasional crocuses and snowdrops, I saw my first bluebell yesterday, only a single bloom, but it filled me with hope that the good weather would last.  Then I looked at the forecast: Rain starting Friday evening, changing into snow Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning, with snow and ice accumulation of 3-7”.  Then it rains again.  My friends here remind me that it is only mid-April.  Sigh.  
To cheer myself up, I played with my gear, going through my checklist and making sure that everything was there, like the tent stakes in with the tent, and figuring out how to fit it all into my backpack.  Not a problem. Stuff needed only at night (sleeping bag and pad, tent, clothing, and “make-camp” kit) goes in the bottom, with the Bearicade sitting vertically on top, with rain gear and puffy stuffed alongside.  I’ll be able to get to my food without unpacking.  The one thing that stymied me was my Sawyer Squeeze water filter, back-flushing syringe, dirty water bag and collapsible scoop.  I could just stick it in a side pocket alongside the water bottle,  but I’ve had stuff pop out of those pockets before.  It’s a bit too large to stow easily in one of the Circuit’s hip belt pockets, and anyway, I like to keep one of the hip belt pockets for phone and reading glasses and the other for snacks.  The answer came in a dream.  I took one of the removable hip belt pockets from my old ArcBlast backpack and mounted it on the side of my new pack, above the one-liter Platypus bladder.  It adds a half-ounce of weight, but keeps the filter easily accessible.  Having the filter and bladder on the outside of the pack will encourage me to filter during the day and to stay hydrated, even if it’s raining and I don’t want to open the pack.  That half-ounce bothered me and I felt compelled to offset the gain.  Another moment of revelation this morning.  Inspired by Hungry Cat, I purchased a Buff this year, replacing my fleece cap and balaclava.  I’ve always carried a bandana, but it weighs 1.2 ounces.  It’s been my sweatband, pirate cap, washcloth, potholder, and handkerchief.  With the clarity that daybreak brings, I realized that with the Buff, I only need the bandana for the latter three uses.  Cutting it in half on the bias saved 0.6 ounces, and I won’t have to use my Buff as a snot rag.   
The total weight of my gear, excluding consumables, is just shy of 15 pounds.  Leaving town with four days of food and 1.5 liters of water, my total pack weight will be 26 pounds.  That’s about 3-1/2 pounds heavier than last year, but with the suspension of the Circuit, this feels quite good.
I also saw this week where the Econo Lodge in Harpers Ferry had been rebranded as a Quality Inn.  I don’t know if that’s a step up or down or a lateral move, but I felt compelled to phone to reconfirm my prepaid reservation.  No problem, but I would have worried about it if I hadn’t phoned.  I also made plans for a celebratory dinner on my first night in Harpers Ferry, inviting a few friends.  Given the odds of completing a thru-hike (although I’m sure that I will), I thought it makes sense to celebrate first!",,View Entry,"Apr 13, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587360,"I started the week with one of my most hated pre-hike rituals, the Trimming of the Body Hair. I have become a Mexican hairless dog, albeit a bearded one with a full head of hair without  pointy ears and a tail.  I should have gone to the doggy day spa and jumped up on the table and let the professionals whack away.  At least I would have gotten a treat.  I do this dreaded routine a couple of weeks before the start of a hike, so that the itching is over and any nicks are healed before I head out.  I don’t shave my body, but I do trim it  closely using a Wahl electric trimmer that is actually called The Manscaper©.  Okay, I admit I bought it because of the name, but it does a fine job on my beard the rest of the year.  Why do I subject myself to this humiliation?  Because it’s easier to keep my body clean with less hair and easier to spot and to remove any ticks.  
Ticks!  How I loathe them!  More than black flies, more than deer flies, more than leeches, even more than spiders.  Blacklegged ticks or deer ticks to be specific.  Ixodes scapularis.  In addition to Lyme disease, they can transmit anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and Powassan disease.  The risk from rattlesnakes and bears is minuscule by comparison.  A bear attack would be a date gone bad, but at least it wouldn’t leave me with debilitating fatigue, fever, neck and joint pain, and mental confusion — and that’s just the first phase.  Having had Lyme disease once, I will suffer the indignity of trimming my hair and wearing pyrethrin-treated clothing.   
Another highlight of the week was receiving the official 2018 thru-hiker’s hang tag in the mail from Appalachian Trail Conservancy.  It’s a bright orange color this year and coordinates well with my pack.  I don’t know what I would do if the colors clashed.  Cancel the hike?  It’s just a little plastic triangle, but clipping it to my pack was quite emotional, akin to unwrapping a Wonka Bar and discovering the Golden Ticket!
Adding to the excitement this week was a visit from my friend Ed from Sarasota.  We’ve known each other for about 45 years and have disagreed on almost everything touching on politics and theology the entire time.  Somehow we’ve remained friends.  It was joining Ed and some of his fellow attorneys in canoeing the Allagash in Maine and parts of the Marias and Missouri Rivers in Montana that convinced me to take up solo hiking.   So I am indebted to him.  Vermont has cooperated with a few  nice snow shower and a thorough dusting last night, since a visit to Vermont is incomplete without snow. It was planned to be just an overnight visit.  Ed had borrowed a Subaru from his friend in Connecticut and driven up.  As he headed back, about five miles south of Burlington, a warning light came on.  Ed phoned.  Did I know what it meant?  Like I would have a clue.  But I do know where the Subaru dealer is and directed him there.  It’s a blown head gasket, so Ed’s short visit is quickly becoming The Man Who Came to Dinner, starring Bette Davis and Monty Woolley, this being day four.  Ed resembles Monty, so I get to play Bette.  Needless to say, his sheets and towels were already in the washer and the guest bathroom cleaned when he phoned.  Wouldn’t I rather be on the Trail?
The best thing of all this week was Tom’s safe return from a week of visiting family in Georgia. 
The only things remaining to be done before I leave next Friday is a prophylactic visit to the chiropractor, my annual eye exam, a haircut, and buying groceries for the first four days of the hike.  There are so many snack options to be had here between our food co-op and Trader Joe’s.  I found organic, GMO-free Vermont-sourced moon pies at City Market yesterday, guilt-free decadence. Trader Joe’s has freeze-dried mango and individual packages of Manzanilla olives.  So many choices that I won’t find  the Trail.  I must carry something made from Vermont maple syrup on principle.",,View Entry,"Apr 20, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587949,"When I was a little boy growing up in Maryland, I didn’t want to go on family vacations.  I had my routine and saw no value in upsetting it.  When I was finally forced into the backseat of the car, I would turn around backwards and look through the rear window.  (This was before cars had seatbelts.)  I was more interested in where we had been than where we were going.  Only after nothing looked familiar would I turn around and be curious about our destination, actually more fearful than curious.  This personality quirk has prepared me well for life in Vermont, where change is never greeted with open arms and is only grudgingly accepted after a proper period of mourning for the old.  Decisions in my city of Burlington are made with glacial speed, and I mean glacial before climate change accelerated their movement.  Three years of meetings lead to a decision.  Following protests or the threat of a lawsuit, the rounds of meetings recommence.  It’s a speed that suits my character well.  The eventual outcome is often superior to the interim decision, and it has resulted in a good measure of historic preservation for the city’s architecture and open spaces.  
In the days immediately before leaving to start my thru-hike, I find myself taking great pleasure in the rituals of my life here.  I will miss seeing the great murders of crows flying out to the composting plant in the morning and returning to the city at night.  I will miss walking down to the Y and seeing familiar faces.  I will miss the four others who regularly frequent morning prayer at the Episcopal Cathedral.  And I will certainly miss my husband Tom who is rock steady in all things, especially in his love for me.  My day here is largely filled with meaningless rituals that collectively imbue my life with meaning.  I suspect that it is this way for most people, except that most people pretend that the rituals themselves are of cosmic significance.  I’m not much different from Dylan Thomas’ Welsh shepherds who make ritual observances to the moon to protect their flocks, because they would be damn’ fools if they didn’t.  
Leaving home still has me looking backwards.  I prefer a pace of travel that lets me make a gradual transition between places, but it’s about 500 miles from Burlington to Washington.  That’s under two hours by plane, nine hours by car, 13 hours by train, 15 hours by bus, 50 hours by bicycle, or 163 hours by foot.  The bus costs slightly less than flying, but really, is that the way I want to start my hike?  Amtrak’s schedules just don’t work well unless I want to spend a night in Washington, D.C.  So flying it will be.  I’ve never enjoyed flying, even when I flew often enough to gain Medallion Status on Delta and frequent upgrades to first-class.  I always find it disconcerting to enter a metal tube, subject myself to noise and weird lighting, and disembark disoriented in a totally different place.  Except for the destination, it reminds me of enduring an MRI.  As miserable as it is, flying will get me to Washington and I’ll take the Metro to Union Station, check my pack, and be ready for the museums on the Mall to open at 10AM.   It’s apparition without wizardry.  Then I’ll board the Amtrak Capital Limited to Harpers Ferry at 4:05PM.  
Yesterday, I bought food for the first four days of my hike except for flour tortillas that I’ll pick up tomorrow.  I’ll spend time today going through my checklist twice, packing my gear and making a list of last minute things to bring, like my cellphone charger and house key.  I should feel excited, but Ken being Ken, I feel wistful.",,View Entry,"Apr 25, Wed",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588341,"I witnessed two miracles of modern transportation yesterday: My flight from Burlington to Washington National arrived 35 minutes early, and the Amtrak train from Union Station to Harpers Ferry left on time and arrived as scheduled. Not exactly curing a leper, driving out demons, or the loaves and fishes, but miraculous nonetheless and proof of the existence of God. I am truly grateful. 
Cousin Debbie’s flight from Albany was on time. As always I had to ask for help to figure out the Metro card machine. It is not at all intuitive to me. The bag check service at Union Station used to be handled by a private vendor and was frightfully expensive. Now Amtrak does it for $10 for up to 24 hours, definitely worth it compared to lugging a backpack around the Mall. After mailing our pack duffels home, we toured the Museum of the American Indian in the morning. It’s not set up as a typical White European museum with rooms devoted to textiles, sculpture and artifacts. Instead there are exhibitions of various Indian nations, designed to showcase that particular culture’s spiritual values as expressed in their stories, art, and concept of nature and relationships. Often side-by-side text panels were used to relate stories from Indian and white perspectives. There was less about culture clash and more about celebrating the living nations.   Hard to express and more powerful upon reflection than while walking around.  After lunch, we walked to the new REI store and bought gas canisters. 
I hosted a celebration of my hike at the Bavarian Inn in Shepherdstown last night. Debbie and I each had the King Salmon and my friend Stacey chose two wonderful Pinot noirs, one from California and the other my favorite St. Innocent from Oregon’s Willamette Valley.  Stacey is the CFO of Appalachian Trail Conservancy and we worked together many years during my time as treasurer.  She is Earth Mother and I love her. We were joined by Sandi Marra,  the current chair of the ATC board. We suffered countless meetings together. Sandi’s husband Chris oversees maintenance of the infamous Roller Coaster section of the AT in northern Virginia, our party was made complete by Steve,  who served as COO of ATC and  thru-hiked in the early 1990’s and his partner Lisa, a skilled ceramics artist.  Debbie fit right in and even if I don’t finish my thru-hike (bite my tongue), I will still have celebrated it. 
ATC is holding a Flop Flop Festival this weekend to encourage thru-hikers to start their hikes in places other than Georgia. About eight of us were greeted by ATC’s new president and CEO Suzanne Dixon at a small reception this morning. Her energy and enthusiasm filled the room. She has a vision from for a much more visible ATC and is willing to make changes to protect and preserve the Trail. One of her first acts was to open an office in Washington in space rented from the Wilderness Society.  Before its move to Harpers Ferry, ATC was in Washington, and that’s where it incorporated.  Benton MacKaye, who founded ATC and whose vision continues to inspire it, was also a founder of the Wilderness Society, so it’s a nice symmetry.  Laurie Potteiger, Director of Information a/k/a Trail Mom, led us in a discussion of our hopes and fears. We attended one workshop on health and hygiene that scared the bejesus out of me - more tick stories!  In the evening there was a reunion of past classes if thru-hikers who started at the three prior festivals and a celebration of this year’s class. We really had a chance to get to know each other over beers. I particularly got to know Willow and River. River has shorter hair than I do and she’s now my new adopted Trail sister. It feels like we will be starting our hike as friends!  REI had a photo booth. I chose to pose with an old trail friend as a reminder of why I’m carrying a bear canister.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588456,"Thanks to all of the Flip Flop Festival volunteers. This was a major production with a cast of dozens, including a pancake breakfast this morning at Camp Hill Wesley Church. I’ve offered to send down Vermont maple syrup for next year’s festival!  There was also bacon, bananas, orange juice and coffee. I’m off coffee but really enjoyed the juice.  I thanked one volunteer who had thru-hiked a couple of years ago. He lives in Waynesboro, PA and gave me his phone number if we need a ride to the hotel we’ve reserved!  
Then the FF class of 2018 walked up to ATC headquarters for a group photo and we were off. People scattered. Two caught a ride 10 miles north and slack-packed back to Harpers Ferry. Others took a shortcut through the cemetery to Jefferson Rock. Debbie and I and Willow followed the blue blazes through the Storer College Campus to the AT. Others are delaying their starts until Monday or Tuesday.   River will start Tuesday, and I hope she catches up to us. 
The view from Jefferson Rock of the confluence of the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers is awesome in the sense of the word before it became overused.  In town the princess trees were blooming. The pink blossoms are lovely but they are a major invasive species, introduced by ... Thomas Jefferson ... for whom the rock is named. Jefferson reportedly said that the view was worth a trip across the Atlantic. After walking between the bombed out shell of St. John’s Episcopal Church and the still active St. Peter’s Roman Catholic Church, the Trail crosses the Potomac on a walkway cantilevered from a railroad bridge and descends to the C&O Canal Towpath.  Then starts several miles of level walking!  We were passed by many bicyclists, one of whom intentionally jumped his bike into a puddle to splash Willow. Not nice. There was also a 100-mile running race along the towpath. We saw the stragglers, and they did not look happy. At a rest tent, we were offered water and bananas - we needed neither - and each of us was given two energy gels, each with 32 mg of caffeine!  More magic. 
The trail finally leaves the towpath for the big climb of the day, up Weverton Cliffs, to a splendid viewpoint over the Potomac. We are catching the tail end of the raptor migration and saw eight hawks. We were joined by a group of about 10 African American hikers from Baltimore who will complete their three-day 25-mile hike from Maryland’s Washington Monument to Harpers Ferry. They were thrilled to learn how easy the hike along the towpath is. The kids were wildly enthusiastic and are making plans for a 50-mile hike in October.  We ate lunch at the cliff. I tried my Skippy  Creamy Peanut Butter with Honey on a tortilla.  Really excellent!  For dessert, I inhaled my first Little Debbie Oatmeal Cream Pie of the hike. Oh the bliss!  I loaded up one of my hip belt pockets with snacks this morning - freeze dried mango, dried mandarin orange slices, maple pork jerky, a bag of fruit, nuts and chocolate and a Lemon Luna Bar and have managed to eat most of it. 
A word about Willow. She’s middle aged from Madison, Wisconsin with two grown sons who sound amazing. Her husband drove her down and attended the Flip Flop Festival with her. I am enjoying her company and the three of us have similar hiking speeds. Willow was upset this morning when she couldn’t find one of her Dirty Girl Gaiters. She found it stuck inside her pants after breakfast!  Don’t they go great with Debbie’s Crocs?
The two miles from the cliffs to Ed Garvey Shelter passed quickly  I am starting to remember how to hike on rocks again, just setting a line and following it. It’s becoming automatic already.   It’s chilly here in the 40’s with a low of 37 forecast. We are tenting. Debbie had a true moment of panic and blaming her son when she couldn’t find the fly for her tent.  She had rolled it inside her sleeping  pad. Debbie has also spent some time making adjustments to her pack. Debbie has no hips and the pack kept sliding down. She’s shortened the torso length and it looks much better. 
This is a lovely two-story shelter and the water source is a gushing piped spring. The only trouble is that the spring is 1/2 mile steeply downhill. It really makes me appreciate running water at home. I hadn’t used my Sawyer Squeeze Filter since last year and it took some backflushing to get it working properly. Always something on the first day. 
Half a bag of spinach and cheese tortellini and s Little Debbie for dessert and my tummy is full and happy. There’s a total of about ten hikers here tonight. Most are Flip-flippers and all are nice. I will learn their names but there is The Beaver and No Peekee. There are stories behind those names but not rated for a general audience. 
We have been blessed with the magic of pancakes, the offer of a shuttle,  caffeine bombs, the appearance of a missing gaiter that we thought had run off with a sock, great excited kids, the finding of the tent fly, and good company. A great first day. Then I received an email of good wishes from Collin’s Dad making it even better. And tonight is a full moon, the pink moon, as April’s full moon is called.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588623,"It was cold last night, in the upper 30’s. I was warm enough in my 35 degree bag but  by morning, I was mummied in tight, with just a three-inch breathing hole over my mouth and nose. My down puffy in the fleece sided clothing sack makes a very fine pillow, but I might have slept better had I worn it instead. 
I awoke late for me at 5:15 and didn’t want to leave my warm nest, but my body left me no choice. The moldering privy is well maintained with no odor at all and a full barrel of wood chops, but the steps up to it are steep with the bottom one missing. New structures on the AT should be accessible, but this one is anything but.   The valley to the east was filled with fog and changed from pink to red to purple with the rising sun, providing entertainment as I ate my breakfast of a tortilla and precooked bacon. I gave Debbie a wake up call about 6:30. Willow left shortly after. We saw her at an overlook where we ate lunch, but she has obviously gotten ahead of us. 
The tread way was somewhat rocky for long stretches today, something Debbie doesn’t appreciate.  It requires concentration and lifting the feet higher than usual. Debbie misjudged in one place and her trailing foot caught a rock. Debbie fell forward in slow motion and suffered a minor bloody nose and abrasions and a contusion over her left eye. It has developed into a pair of black eyes that would do a teenaged boy proud . Debbie rejects the trail name of Raccoon, but what do you think?  There’s already another black eye in my FLip-Flop class. One of the two slack packers fell yesterday and her trail companion Sally Forth christened her Shiner.   Debbie has proposed Anchor for herself because she thinks she’s holding me back. She’s not. These short initial days are the best thing I’m doing to improve the odds of completing my thru-hike. Besides, a trail name ought to be self-referential, like Klutz or Clumsy.  For now she remains just Debbie. Not even Little Debbie.  These are not the only injuries. Plumber Man had a knee go “pop” on a downhill and now must lead with the injured leg. He plans to go off trail and at least rest it a couple of days. It sounds more serious than rest will cure. With my knees, I can feel for him.  And be grateful that mine continue pain free. 
To add to her woes, one of the load lifter straps on Debbie’s pack is coming loose. She sewed it back on this afternoon with dental floss. The pack is her son’s and really doesn’t fit her. Debbie has very narrow shoulders and hips and needs a woman’s pack. There’s a Super Walmart in Waynesboro and we will check it out on Thursday. 
We had planned to stay at Rocky Run Shelter tonight but we decided to push on 1.8 miles to Dahlgren Back Pack Campground provided by the State of Maryland. There’s a bathhouse with free hot showers, but no soap, shampoo, towels or room service. Great to be clean again and to have my hiking clothes drying in the sun!
At 6:30 there are now 16 tents and tarps of every description at Dahlgren, lured in by a hot shower. We are about 0.2 mile from Turners Gap and South Mountain Inn, a restaurant of long standing reputed to have served George Washington. Alas, they are closed on Mondays.","Ed Garvey Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588786,"At the Festival, each Flip-flopper was given a small Trail Karma necklace with instructions to pass it along to someone on the trail evidencing supreme Leave-No-Trace ethic.   I offloaded my 1/2 ounce trinket at lunch today, at the side trail to Annapolis Rocks. Josh and his son Hudson recently moved to Baltimore from Southern California. They are hiking from Harpers Ferry to Pen Mar Park just south of the Mason Dixon Line. Properly indoctrinated out West, they are carrying a bear canister.  Very few do on the AT, and it’s emblematic of a strong commitment to LNT values.   This earns them trail Karma. 
The trail Karma immediately returned to me in the form of an instant ice pack for Debbie’s black eyes, kindly donated by one of the counselors of a Roads Scholar program being held at a local nature retreat center. The black eyes intensified over night and people were looking at me like I had taken a cast iron skillet to her.   I didn’t. Can you imagine me carrying that weight, let alone doing such a thing?  If I had I done so, I would look far worse than Debbie, I do believe. 
At the Festival, we were also offered LNT pins made by the 7th grade art class at Harmony Middle School. I proudly pinned mine to the front of my right shoulder strap. Their teacher encouraged us to email the class photos of the pin from places along the trail. I sent my first photo today from the Washington Monument, the stone creamery bottle looking thing, that was used as a signal station during the Civil War. It offers stunning views, including the Antietam battlefield to the south west. 
The treadway was mostly easy today, with just occasional rocky areas. It often followed old sunken roads or woods roads.   The temperature climbed to near 80 this afternoon. I rolled up my sleeves and zipped off my pants legs, forcing me to spray my legs with DEET.  In spite of yesterday’s shower, I am rapidly gaining my own signature hiker stench. My clothes may be anti-stink but I am not. 
I had no problem finishing my bag of snacks for today and wolfed down Starkist Tuna Salad on a tortilla for lunch. Tonight will be the rest of the spinach and cheese tortellini and a few Champlain dark chocolate squares.  It’s only 4:00. Still time for a bag of nuts, fruit and chocolate.  The HUNGER is beginning!

There were very short pieces of lovely trail, soft underfoot, shaded and level. Then there was the rest of the day. A long stretch of “rock garden,” called the Devil’s Raceway, was particularly annoying with just a jumble of rocks to walk on. The trail switched back across the rock field for far too long.  It’s a foretaste of NE Pennsylvania. There were many steep ups and downs today, with a total of 1,900’ of elevation gain.   The final climb of the day up to Raven Rock Shelter was 600 vertical feet in 0.9 miles.  Anything over 500’ in a mile is steep. Adding to the misery was a temperature of about 85 degrees.  The trees are still just leafing out and the rocks radiated heat.  It made for an exhausting day. 
Willow joined Debbie and me for today’s hike and is planning to join us in Waynesboro, Pennsylvania tomorrow.
Today I met Trail Blazer who has been following my journal. He passed 500 miles today so I rewarded him with my remaining package of Manzanilla olives, a true trail treat. He’s hiking with Grumpy Old Man, who actually seems quite kindly, and Now. 
Debbie has embraced her trail name of Rocky Raccoon. Trail Blazer is a doctor and reassured her about her black eyes.  They are quite spectacular. 
Raven Rock Shelter is nearly new and immaculate. The pine floor is even well varnished. The spring here is excellent, but unfortunately about 1/2 mile steeply downhill.  How spoiled I had become back home, having running water, indoor plumbing, heating, air conditioning, and a free shuttle bus running up and down steep College Street.

",Raven Rock Shelter,"May 02, Wed",9.90
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588954,"By sunset last night at Raven Rock Shelter, we were surrounded by trail friends. Sally Forth has been hiking with The Professor, but that seems over now. This was not a trail romance by any stretch of the imagination, but people often seem to team up just because they can. Whatever it was, it is over now. Sally Forth’s Trail bud from the Festival, Shiner, asked if she could hike with Willow, Rocky Raccoon and me today. It was only a 4.7 mile hike to Pen Mar Park, 0.2 miles shy of the Pennsylvania border. Rocky and Willow moved ahead at a good clip, causing Willow to fall twice. Hers were good falls, landing on her butt, and not on her face. So no new black eyes today. In our little trail family, sometimes called a “tramily,” I remain the only unfallen one. I don’t mind being left out of this exclusive club. Shiner and I lagged behind, and it gave us a chance to get to know each other. Shiner is a master barber from West Georgia and her son is a leading YouTuber, Dallmyd, who is an urban treasure hunter. It’s all new to me!
Pen Mar Park was built by the Western Maryland Railroad as an excursion from Baltimore. It’s now a county park and has been substantially restored and renovated. There are once again concerts in the park. The park opens this weekend but the restrooms and drinking fountain were available to us. The groundskeepers were extremely friendly and helpful. I phoned Francis for a shuttle to the Cobblestone Hotel in nearby Waynesboro, Pennsylvania, explaining that there were four of us now. Roger and Francis are a retired couple who provide short shuttles to hikers out of love. She reluctantly accepted $10 from us. Meeting people like Francis really reminds us about the essential goodness of our fellow citizens. The Professor showed up and wanted a ride to  different hotel, but there simply wasn’t room in the compact car. Francis offered to return after taking us, but the Professor is unaccustomed to having his will thwarted.  Never argue with a gracious lady who is essentially offering rides out of the goodness of her heart!  It is not productive. 
Today was very hot, reaching 90 degrees, and we were very grateful to be in an air conditioned hotel by 11:00. The Cobblestone graciously offered us a 20% hiker discounts and allowed us to check in early. When we first walked in, we all exclaimed, “It smells so nice in here!”  We have forgotten how nice clean smells. It is good!  The rooms are immaculate with charging outlets everywhere, strong WiFi, and above all, showers with great water pressure. After washing our clothes in the guest laundry, the four of us walked over to the nearby Appleby’s. After a delicious side salad with bleu cheese dressing, their signature American hamburger and fries, and an Arnold Palmer (1/2 iced tea and 1/2 lemonade, refilled twice) I am happily sated.  Then we walked over to the Super Walmart. I’ve never been in one before and felt quite overwhelmed. I bought enough food to get to Boiling Springs next Wednesday. I make a list but sitting in the basket and now in my bear canister, it seems like way too much. It won’t be. Instead of my beloved Little Debbie Oatmeal Creme Pies, I bought a package of Pepperidge Farms Orange Milano cookies!  Back in the room, I’ve stripped the packaging from everything. 
Now, I’m ready to complete this most pleasant town visit with a visit to the hotel’s bar. Say with me, “Aaah!”
I forgot to take any photos today, but perhaps one of you could tell me what this wildflower is.","Raven Rock Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589053,"Thanks to Spike Rhino for recognizing the bloodroot flower!  Also my dear friend Sandy from Longboat Key, Florida who confirms the identification. 
Sitting around the hotel bar last night nursing a bourbon on the rocks was most pleasant but also sad. Shiner’s resupply at the Super Walmart consisted of buying a large suitcase. She arranged for a shuttle to Baltimore-Washington International Airport at 3AM. Between the drama of the trail and tugs from home, especially from  a 4-year old angel of a girl that she and her husband are raising, Shiner reached her decision. We all had a joyful time yesterday and that’s a great way for her to end her hike. Shiner will finish the trail as a section hiker, definitely not the lesser babka (a Seinfeld reference).   Cue the spooky organ. These are the days of our life ...  Possibly Shiner will join us on part of the trail in the south. That would be a treat!
I am in the habit of saying the daily offices of Morning and Evening Prayer. It’s a habit easily broken and I frequently skim lessons I don’t like, like the current Old Testament readings from Leviticus. Saying the offices makes me feel in touch with a ritual that goes back nearly 2,000 years in the Christian tradition and far longer in Judaism. It makes me feel part of something far larger than myself. Don’t worry, I’m not going to go all squishy evangelical on you. My faith and understanding of the divine is like the blind person and the elephant. Perhaps I grasp a single hair on the elephant’s tail. At any rate, yesterday’s Gospel reading from Matthew hit me hard after Shiner’s bombshell. It’s the lovely reading about the birds of the air and the lilies of the field, ending with the gentle exhortation:  So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring worries of its own. Today’s trouble is enough for today,
Whatever your faith or lack thereof, this is my path to a successful hike. I know there will be ups and downs, smooth trail and rock gardens. I know rain is forecast for later today extending into Sunday. Whatever!  I’ll rejoice in the cooler weather and in the knowledge that the springs will be recharged.  I won’t melt but I may shelter instead of tenting. Whatever. It’s all good. 
After committing gluttony at the hotel’s breakfast buffet, I phoned Francis for a shuttle back to Pen Mar Park.  Rocky Raccoon, Willow and I were hiking by 9. I was feeling very lead belly and struggling with a full load of food and water. It was hot and humid. After a brief downhill, we started the big uphill of the day. Breakfast almost didn’t make it to the top, and I struggled to keep up with Rocky Raccoon. Aside from nibbling on nuts, dried fruit and these marvelously chewy dried sausages, I’ve eaten nothing but a four-serving bag of potato chips left as Trail magic about a mile from our destination Tumbling Run Shelter. The sausages are noteworthy.  They look like mummified Vienna sausages, or with my Flannery O’Connor hat on, petrified Egyptian penises worthy of worship by Enoch.  I will have Ramen and a pouch of chicken for dinner. 
Fortunately after the up and unzipping the bottom legs from my pants and switching to a sweatband instead of my hat, things improved. The rest of the trail today was kind and gentle, with frequent road crossings and babbling brooks.  There were a few brief rain showers, just enough for us to put our pack covers on twice, and just enough to make the woods steamy. 
Tumbling Run Shelter is a double Shelter with a covered picnic pavilion and a real privy that actually has toilet paper and is periodically pumped out. I can hardly wait until morning!  Rocky and Willow are tenting tonight, but I’ve decided to sleep one of the shelters. Joining me is Steady from Oklahoma, another Flip-flopper who is carrying a bear canister. It’s an immediate bond.  Also in our side are The Three Sisters, Carol, Paulie, and Dee. Our side looks like a department store after a sale, with clothes and goodies scattered everywhere. 
Also here are The Professor, Day Maker, sand several others I haven’t met. 
The Shelter caretaker came by to replenish the toilet paper and is a prince of a fellow. He has been volunteering with Potomac Appalachian Trail Club for 25 years!  We could not thank him enough!","Pen Mar Park
",Tumbling Run Shelter,"May 04, Fri",8.50
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589202,"Last night we met the shelter maintainers at Tumbling Run Shelter and today two trail maintainers and the chief maintainer at Quarry Gap Shelter, Jim Stauch, and his designated successor and intern, Bill. It’s impossible to say thank you too often to the maintainers. I even shared my Orange Milano cookies with Jim. The Appalachian Trail is unusual perhaps unique in being conceived, constructed and maintained by volunteers. Over 6,000 volunteers contribute over 250,000 hours annually to the Trail. Jim Stauch is unusually zealous about “his” Shelter, and justifiably so. He designed the shelter, built the shelter, and has maintained it for 42 years. Today is his wife’s birthday, but where is Jim?  At his shelter remortaring the fire place. There are hanging baskets of pansies, a swinging porch glider, and a ceramic frog on the short path leading to the spring. There were solar lights lining the paths to the spring and the privy when I was last here, but ATC insisted on their removal as not in keeping with the primitive experience. Spoil sports!  
This was Rocky Raccoon’s first 12 mile day ever, and she flew!  For the most part the trail was gentle after a very steep up to start the day, but there was a section where the trail follows a razor back ridge with lots of almost bouldering, good practice for New Hampshire.  At Caladonia State Park, we met a group of six ladies also coming to Quarry Gap. Then they passed us while we were having lunch. Rocky determined that we would beat them to the shelter and we practically sprinted up the steep stairs and trail from the park, chasing them down one by one. It wasn’t very nice of us, but I’m so proud of Debbie. The improvement in her hiking strength in one week has been staggering.  I have no doubt that she could thru-hike if she wanted to, especially if she invested in lighter weight gear. 
Rocky and I are staying in the shelter tonight.  It has started to rain now and an inch is expected through tomorrow, but for tonight we are warm and dry, surrounded by friends. Willow is here and a charming recent college graduate named Sam. The six ladies are keeping their own company. A few section hikers, including one from Germany, are visiting with us. After the hike today, I’m looking forward to dinner and sleep.   Day 7 on the AT has been good to us.","Tumbling Run Shelter
",Quarry Gap Shelters,"May 05, Sat",12.20
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589421,"Willow was behind Rocky Raccoon and me yesterday and scored a major yogi at Caladonia State Park, an invitation to a picnic in progress. Rocky and I had walked past the same pavilion an hour earlier and no one came running out to invite us over. There’s something about Willow that brings out the best in people. She arrived at the shelter last night with a full and happy belly.   I feel honored to be hiking with Willow. She chose to tent last night. At Quarry Gap Shelter, the tent sites are restricted to wooden platforms that can be tricky for non-free standing tents. Willow managed to secure the four corners of her tent but didn’t guy out the sides, with the result that water was channeled into her tent during last night’s rain. Her tent’s bathtub floor proved quite watertight and accumulated several inches of water by morning.   But at least Willow wasn’t hungry.  Willow being Willow remained cheerful and always feels blessed. 
I stayed in the shelter last night and used my moldable silicone earplugs. I never heard the deluge of rain, nor the thunder from nearby lightning. Instead I dreamed about a criminal family headed by the Czarina. I was working in a fashion boutique and recommended a gown for her in silk velvet and iridescent sapphire French taffeta that brought out the blue of her eyes and complemented her silver hair.  My dreams can be very detailed!  The Czarina took a liking to me and brought me to her headquarters where I was introduced to her grandson (I was much younger in my dream). Except for the Czarina threatening to stab me with an ice knife at one point, it was a very pleasant dream, and I’m glad to have missed the storm.  
It wasn’t raining this morning, but we headed off in our rain suits with pack covers on in about 50 degree weather.  I wore long underwear under my rain suit and was quite comfortable. PJ and Sam joined Willow. Rocky Raccoon and me for the short 7.4 mile hike to Birch Run Shelter.  PJ is middle aged and having some blister problems. Sam has degrees in physics and mechanical engineering and has taken a position in a consulting firm dealing with acoustics. He lives in Houston.  His employer has assured him that his position will be available when he returns from his thru-hike, which speaks very well for him.  The five of us have similar hiking speeds. It didn’t do more than lightly sprinkle this morning and we arrived at Birch Run Shelter dry. About  15 minutes later, the heavens opened.  Rain fell for the rest of the afternoon.   It’s a great feeling to arrive at a shelter just before it rains, as though we are in the right place at the right time, a feeling of being blessed.  Cue the Shaker hymn, Simple Things.  Those hikers who came in during the rain did not have quite the same feeling.   
I set my tent up since I’ve sheltered the last two nights.  We are in a small bubble of Flip-floppers. The shelter hold eight and there are about 15 of us, including section hikers and one hiker who started in Georgia in March. He’s fast!  After a lunch of tuna salad on tortillas topped off with a Little Debbie Oatmeal Creme Pie, I’m relaxing in my tent, which is quite waterproof. It’s made from Cuben Fiber, also known as Dynema, a fabric that doesn’t stretch.  When set taut, my tents sounds like a tin-roofed barn in the rain.  I am determined to learn how to nap on this hike and this seems like the perfect time to start my lessons. 
The trail today was pleasant, with a few steep ups and downs but mostly easy walking. For about 1/2  mile, the trail passed through a very dark white pine grove that felt very mysterious in a good way. The trail was cushioned in pine needles. 
I couldn’t stay awake and crawled into my tent about 7:00. I was sleeping sounding when the %#*^ whippoorwill started its wretched song over and over again. A cardinal principle of Leave No Trace is Respect Wildlife. I confess to thinking murderous thoughts. He eventually stopped but returned about 4:00AM.  Kill the birdie!  Kill the birdie!","Quarry Gap Shelters
",Birch Run Shelter,"May 06, Sun",7.40
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589472,"Thanks to the whippoorwill, I awoke early. The hike today was easy, mostly downhill to Pine Grove Furnace State Park, and the weather could not have been nicer, mostly in the 50’s and low 60’s. We passed through an area of Michaux State Forest that was recently burned to reduce undergrowth.  It is eerily beautiful. The early European settlers reported that the eastern woods were open enough to drive a carriage through them. That wasn’t natural but the result of fires set by American Indians. The open forest favors deer and other game animals favored by the Indians. It’s good to see fire once again being used to maintain an ecosystem. The Florida prairies are another example of a fire-maintained ecosystem. We also saw a scarlet tanager today. What a beautiful bird!  
Today, we passed the monument marking the half-way point of the Appalachian Trail, but not the midpoint of my hike!  This year’s sign points to the termini, a distance of 1,090.5 in each direction. I wonder how the northbound thru-hiker from last night reacted. Did he think, “I’ve done half the Trail!” or “Oh, my Lord, I’ve only done half the Trail!”  The marker moves each year. In 1998, it was just north of Pine Grove Furnace State Park. The southern part must be stretching faster. 
We did the 10 miles before noon. The Park general store is open and I binged on a hiker burger (fried egg, bacon, cheese, avocado, lettuce and tomato), fries and an iced tea. For dessert I had a single scoop of chocolate ice cream. Oh, happy tummy!  I confess to not finishing the fries.   We saw a northbound thru-hiker successfully complete the 1/2 gallon ice cream challenge, although he used a real spoon instead of the traditional wooden one. 
The Iron Masters Mansion doesn’t open until 5:00, to allow the hostel keepers some semblance of a life. We toured the Appalachian Trail Museum. I’m glad to see the artifacts being curated and preserved and the start of interpretive exhibits. Benton MacKaye’s archives are at Dartmouth College.  Myron Avery’s are at the University of Maine, and the Appalachian Trail Conservancy has its own extensive archives and memorabilia.  The Museum is drawing from these sources and private collections and presenting materials in a way accessible and informative to the general public. The Museum is housed in the old gristmill that served the Pine Grove Iron Plantation.   The ground floor is dedicated to children’s exhibits.  The main exhibits include Earl Shaffer and Grandma Gatewood’s gear, including one of her signature gunny sacks and a pair of her Keds sneakers. Then we lounged on the hostel porch until it opened at 5:00. 
In the Hostel, we get a bunk with sheets, a shower, pizza and soft drink and breakfast (waffles), all for $36.  Laundry is an additional $3. The bathrooms have toilet paper (a trail luxury), but neither soap nor shampoo.   There was some liquid hand soap and I diluted that.  The men’s and women’s dorms each hold about 15 in bunk beds. The men’s dorm is full, but there are only two women. Earplugs will be necessary in the men’s. 
Iron plantations have a fascinating history during the 18th and 19th centuries, and were important stops on the Underground Railway. Because black and white men worked side-by-side on the iron plantations and many iron masters were Quakers, it was easy for runaway slaves and indentured servants to blend in. One of the closets in the Mansion has a trap door hiding a narrow ladder to a sub basement. I imagine that with a chamber pot set on the trapdoor, it offered a relatively safe place for runaways to find refuge from the slave catchers, who were given impunity by the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. When I stayed here before, I had a dream of a runaway slave named Maria from New Orleans who fell in love with the iron master’s son Anthony, with a tragic outcome. The dream presented itself as an opera. The dream was vivid and I awoke tangled in my sheets fighting for my life!  I am hoping for a more restful night’s sleep on this visit. Willow and Sam are tenting in the State Park, quite possibly a wiser decision. There’s a bathhouse available to them. 
What a wonderful day!  Good weather. Good friends. Good food. Clean body. Clean clothes. A soft place to sleep. What more could anyone want?","Birch Run Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589569,"This is one of those perfect days when I can’t imagine being any place other than where I am on the Appalachian Trail. But first a few comments about last night. 
Rocky Raccoon and I stayed at the Iron Masters Mansion in Pine Grove Furnace State Park last night. It is a mansion of many rooms. Unfortunately only two are used as guest dorms.  Rocky was upstairs with Mary Ann (trail name “No Commitment”) and they had the ladies’ dorm and bath to themselves. I shared the men’s dorm with 13 others. The guy on the top bunk opposite me snored. Snoring is to be expected, but F-35 snoring with each inhalation is not. Naturally, he retired first. The audible snoring was bad enough, but there was also subsonic undertones that penetrated the best earplugs.  It’s how elephants communicate over long distances and alligators make the water appear to boil around them.   Reid showed the most sense. After two hours of sleeplessness, he grabbed his pillow and blanket and retreated to the common area sofa. Wish I had thought of that. Instead, I tossed and turned along with everyone else for the entire night.  I got up at one point to pee and wondered that if I smothered him with a pillow, would anyone rat me out?  Rocky could hear and feel the snoring through the ceiling. Day Maker slept on the bunk beneath him and swears the bed vibrated all night. Morning inevitably came, and along with it Eggo Waffles, bagels, scrambled eggs, orange slices, coffee and orange juice. 
Later this morning two hikers from the hostel passed Rocky and me. I asked if they slept well last night. The large man just grunted and rolled his eyes.  The other slender wiry guy with a pointed chin chirped that he had slept perfectly. Then I recognized him as the snorer. He seemed quite proud of his accomplishment. I have named him for my own reference, Ferret. 
Meanwhile in the cool guys’ campground in the Park, the mystique of Willow continued to blossom. Willow and Sam took a tent site next to a 25’ Renegade recreational vehicle. They were able to shower in the camp bathhouse. They describe it as a prison shower. Each press of the button yielded just 6 seconds of water.  Later that evening a couple from the RV brought them cups of apple tea served in bone China set upon Christmas napkins and prayed for God’s protection for their journeys. They also left their RV unlocked so Willow and Sam could charge their devices, cautioning them that, “You know that you are entrusting your precious electronics to us.”  They responded that, “You are entrusting your trailer to us.”
The hike today was anticlimactic by comparison. Perfect temperatures in the 50’s and 60’s, a gentle breeze, the trees just leafed out enough to dapple the sunlight. The native azaleas just beginning to open their pink blossoms that smell delicately sweet, like TOPS bubblegum at a distance. The uphills were short and the downhills gentle. Much of the walking was along old woods roads or on a rail bed that had served the iron plantation. I saw five circular pits about 12’ in diameter that were used for wood ricks to make charcoal for the Furnace. We also saw a dead mouse on the trail that upset Rocky, especially since I may have stepped on it. Rocky also spotted a small pile of rabbit fur that bodes poorly for the bunny. 
At one point, two Buddhist monks in brown robes closely followed by eight disciples in hiking clothes, all with backpacks, passed us southbound. One carried a hiking umbrella. I commented, “Mary Poppins!” and got no reaction. I asked how far they were going. One said, quite seriously, “We are on the Trail of Happiness.”  Whatever. Hike your own hike; carry your own stick (or s%#t).  
A bit later at a road crossing, we met Begonia, a 20-something southbound section hiker “only” going to Tennessee. She wore a black headband surmounted with a wild nest of purple hair and had several facial piercing. Begonia was happiness personified. 
Rocky and I had intended to camp at James Fry Shelter tonight, but we got there at 11:00. We continued on another four miles to a lovely campsite by a gently babbling brook. This will leave us eight miles tomorrow to Boiling Springs. Willow and Sam are with us. After lunch in Boiling Springs and a visit to the historic tavern, we will meet a shuttler at the ATC regional office and go to Carlisle for the night. Rocky’s partner Rick who is returning from ski/hike trip in Utah will meet us there.  They will have one room. Willow, Sam and I will have another. It’s okay. We are tramily now.  This will mark the end of Rocky Raccoon’s hike. She will be sorely missed not just by me but by everyone who has met her. For us Flip-Floppers, she has hiked with us from the start of our hikes.  Like us, she has gained in strength and confidence and will carry with her deep and caring friendships, as well as two black eyes and a possibly broken nose.","Iron Masters Mansion

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589678,"We slept well last night without the Ferret’s snoring. The eight miles into Boiling Springs were not as easy as I remembered, especially with the warm temperatures. There was one section of ridge walking where the trail wandered over and around massive rock formations. We all had to take off our packs and lift them up a four-foot step and then haul ourselves up. Someone with longer legs could probably have just stepped right up it.  When we descended from White Rocks, we faced three miles of walking on the edges of farmfields and farm roads, all in the bright sun. Not even Willow could charm a man sitting the porch of his house. Not even a wave.  As we walked along the Children’s Pond in Boiling Springs, we met Karen Lutz, the Mid-Atlantic Regional Manager for ATC and another employee Michelle. I’ve known Karen for 21 years. She will retire after 30 years service to ATC.  Sam arrived before us and went for pizza. Rocky, Willow and I went to Cafe 101. I had the summer salad with fresh fruit and perfectly grilled shrimp. It took the edge off my appetite. Rocky and I then walked 0.7 miles each way to Karms Grocery. I needed to resupply but Rocky didn’t need to go since her hike ended today. How nice of her!
Karen Lutz found an old stuffed raccoon for Rocky to hold and we posed for a group photo with our friend Day Maker from Maine, retired from LL Bean. Left to right are Day Maker, Sam, me, Rocky Raccoon, and Willow.  Except for Day Maker, we shuttled into Carlisle where we have two rooms at the Red Roof Inn. Rocky’s life partner Rick will be joining us soon and we will meet a few of Rocky’s friends for dinner.  Willow, Sam and I will share the other. It’s okay; we’re tramily!  
Rocky Raccoon is no more now that her hike is over. Once again she is Cousin Debbie. She’s been a great companion and I’m glad that we get to celebrate this evening, especially with two of her close trail friends, Willow and Sam.","Campsite by Brook at 1114.7

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589794,"It’s easy to love everything about the Trail when the weather is perfect, the treadway is gentle, there are scenic views and interesting people. The 14.3 miles from Boiling Springs to Darlington Shelter fell short of the ideal. 
Dinner last night at the Rustic Tavern in Carlisle was quite good. Debbie got to visit with her friends. Willow, Sam, and I got our fill of food, starting with the fresh-from-the-oven yeast rolls. I restrained myself and only ate two. Willow downed three. Sam upheld his hiker cred by inhaling five, but he noted that he buttered only the first four. We each had a crab cake sandwich. The crab cake was the size of a baseball and slid down oh so well, especially with the help of beer. I had a Yuengling Lager, brewed in Pottsville, PA. Yuengling is America’s oldest continually operating brewery, since 1829. I usually prefer a Vermont IPA, but here in Pennsylvania, Yuengling satisfies me. I look forward to their Lord Chesterfield Ale at the Doyle in Duncannon tomorrow. 
After a Red Roof Inn breakfast of a bagel and cream cheese, yogurt, and orange juice, Debbie’s wonderful man Rick shuttled us back to Boiling Springs. First Debbie tried giving me a small stuffed raccoon to carry in her honor. Since it was neither edible nor essential, I asked her to hold it until we visit in August. We started hiking sometime after 8. Sam and I moved out ahead of Willow and did 10 miles to Scott Farm, a trail maintenance facility for the Mid-Atlantic Region, in about three hours.  It started raining about 9:00, but it was just warm enough that wearing just my running shorts and wicking t-shirt felt good.  These 10 miles are nearly level, walking up the Cumberland Valley in a very narrow right of way. The trees and shrubs have grown up significantly since my last visit, but it’s still impossible to ignore the businesses and residences just outside the trail corridor. After a break at Scott Farm, the trail followed a stream gently uphill and then steeply for a mile to Darlington Shelter.  The trail was in excellent condition, with lots of new helical pier boardwalk since my last visit here.  At one trailhead, I saw a large red SUV with the door open and a man in an ATC hat in the driver’s seat.  I had to walk by, so I asked if he were a maintainer. “No,” he said, “I’m a trail angel!”  I saw no food anywhere, and my hopes were dashed when he said he was waiting for a hiker who was slack packing.  On the final rise to the shelter, I met a day hiker with a pronounced belly carrying a 40-pound pack “for training.”  His trail name is Thunder Belly and he was great fun to visit with. 
There’s a chance of a severe thunderstorm by 5:00, so I’m delaying setting up my tent until it passes. Aside from Sam and Willow, Day Maker and Kidska have come in. There’s also a couple of section hikers from Kalamazoo, Michigan busily napping in the shelter. Kidska informs us that after we had left Scott Farm, a Culligan Man came and announced that the water there has E-coli contamination.  I drank several cups and carried out three more. I’ll use that water for cooking. I’m sure I’ve imbibed worse. The spring here is a trickle, so we all loaded up at a stream about a mile before we came up here. 
Even with the rain and the E-coli, it’s been a good day, my first 14-miler. I met at least one interesting person, Thunder Belly, and now I’m surrounded by friends. The rain feels like it will start any minute!","Boiling Springs

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589965,"Last night, we could hear thunder to the east, but the storm appeared to go around us. I set up my tent about 5:00 and cooked the freeze-dried turkey with thyme, wild rice, peas and carrots dinner I had bought at the outfitter in Boiling Springs. I like freeze-dried dinners only occasionally.  There’s a slightly strange taste to all of them. I do better with the totally synthetic tastes of Knorr’s sides and instant mashed potatoes.  The shelter started getting crowded with GA-ME thru-hikers, Flip-Floppers and section hikers. It was too much excitement for me. I retreated to my tent and read And the Mountains Echoed by Khaled Hosseini, one of the books recommended by my readers.  I am nearly finished it and enjoying it immensely.  From the next tent, I could hear a male hiker reading to his female companion. I couldn’t make out the words, and romantic as it may have been for them, I felt like telling me them to shut up. After all, it was after 7PM, and decent folk ought to be asleep. 
I awoke early, ate a Kind Breakfast Bar, and started hiking about 6:15 under blue skies. The trail was frequently rocky, a foretaste of rocks to come, with one stiff ascent early in the day and a very steep descent to Duncannon. I arrived at the Doyle Hotel around 11:30. Quite a few flip-Floppers who had gotten ahead of me took a zero day today. They include Reid, Rizz and Batgirl, who got her name when she had an encounter with a bat in a privy. Also GA-ME hiker Ulysses is here.   Several GA-ME hikers essentially ran by me on the trail this morning. Oh, to be young again!  Perish the thought!  I also met a day hiker, Santa Claus’ Brother who enjoys an audience. 
The Doyle Hotel is a trail institution. It’s one of the original Anheuser Busch Hotels dating back over 100 years, when Duncannon called itself the Jewel of the Susquehanna and was a center of the lumbering industry. The lower part of Duncannon that sometimes floods was used to house the workers and presumably their entertainments.   The Jewel has not aged well.  Pat and Vickey bought the Doyle in 2001 with the intent of restoring it.  The previous owners removed the historic bar top that was Smithsonian-worthy. I stayed in the Doyle in 1998 and once again under Pat and Vickey’s reign. It I is much improved now. Back then, it was so filthy that I spread my ground cloth on top of the bed and slept in my sleeping bag. I would only crouch in the bathtub to minimize contact with it. The Doyle has not aged gracefully. The plumbing and electrical systems are in danger of failing, but my little 3rd floor corner room has cross ventilation.  The sheets are clean, and the showers, well let’s just say that there are showers. In the old days, Yuengling Lager cost $0.50 for a 10 ounce glass and six pensioners with perhaps four teeth between them would open and close the bar daily. When Pat and Vicky bought the Doyle, they raised the price to $1.50 scaring off the riff raff. Now they charge $3.25. Draft beers include several Yuenglings, including the Lord Chesterfield Ale I’ve been fantasizing about. I enjoyed a 10 ounce pour with an excellent shrimp po’boy for lunch.
Town visits have a certain rhythm encompassing eating, doing laundry, and buying groceries. After lunch, I walked two blocks to the laundromat, and at 4:00, the local grocery store provided a shuttle from the Doyle. Willow and I joined Grumpy and Now for pizza at Sorrento’s. Before long, Kidska and Batgirl joined us. Sam popped in to assure that nothing went to waste.   Actually Grumpy carried three slices out for lunch tomorrow.
Duncannon seems like an appropriate milestone to evaluate my hike thus far. My body is doing fine. No blisters or other foot problems. My knees are a little sore from today’s high impact hiking, but there’s no swelling and they will be fine by tomorrow. I’ve taken a total of four Aleve on this hike and seem to be in less pain than most others. My gear is also performing well. I still feel foolish carrying a bear canister, but I’m committed to it. The only change I’ve made is to substitute the Be Free Filter for the Sawyer Squeeze Filter. If I can find it, I would like to substitute a picaridin-based insect repellent for the DEET I’m carrying. I’ll start increasing my daily mileage on the section from Duncannon to Port Clinton and see how that works. Each day in the forecast shows a good chance of showers or thunderstorms, so my mental toughness will be challenged as well.
Friends make all the difference out here. I hope I’ll appreciate my friends at home more after this hike.","Darlington Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590103,"I was asleep by 8:00 last night, with both windows open. I was awakened about 11:00 by heavy rain and closed one of the windows. Then a bit after midnight a siren sounded, one of loudest sounds I’ve ever heard. I basically fell out of bed and groped for my phone, wondering if there were a tornado warning. It was just the volunteer fire department and five minutes later, the fire engines sped away with their own sirens blaring. I never really got back to sleep. I went over to Goodies for breakfast when they opened at six, but I really wasn’t hungry after the pizza last night. I said my fond farewell to The Doyle at seven. The trail follows Duncannon’s High Street, noticeably tonier than Market Street where the Doyle is.  The fancy wood turnings and gingerbread give a glimpse into the past glory of what is now a very tired town.  The trail crosses the Juniata and Susquehanna Rivers on highway bridges. The bridge over the Juniata appears to be in sad shape, with broken concrete and exposed rebar. Several hikers report seeing a woman hitchhiking there, dressed in pajamas, smoking a cigarette, with a blanket and a suitcase. Why such a person would want to leave Duncannon must remain a mystery. 
Over the next two miles, the trail climbs 1,000 feet to the ridge line, that for some distance was angled slabs of rock. The hard rock, of obvious sedimentary origin, contained round pebbles that acted like ball bearings. We all found it treacherous going. I didn’t actually fall, but I did have two unplanned controlled sit downs, falls by any other name. The expected nasty storms showed no signs of coming, so I slowed down and enjoyed meeting people going the other way.  First was a man carrying a parabolic dish for recording bird songs. I would have enjoyed getting to know him better. Then came Giddyup, a silver bearded gentleman from Bradenton, Florida near where we used to live in Sarasota. He thru-hiked in 1975!  There was also a Susquehanna AT Club volunteer with a huge black trash bag filled with garlic mustard, an invasive species that she was pulling up by the handful. 
I arrived at Peters Mountain Shelter around 12:30. Sam, Grumpy, and Now were here. The spring is 0.2 miles downhill on 300 stone stairs. Grumpy and Now decided to hike on to a campsite. After filling their bottles, they had water left over. I was only too glad to accept it and avoid the stairs.  The shelter is beautiful, sleeping about 20 on two floors. There’s also a resident black rat snake, so there are probably no mice. Go snake!  I’m joined by Sam, Batgirl, Reid, Rizz and Ulysses. A troop of Boy Scouts has just hiked in, but they will tent. 
Wildflowers were in profusion today, columbines, violets, Solomon’s seal and plume, various pinks, and even a jack-in-the-pulpit hanging out with the poison ivy. 
A severe thunderstorm is still forecast, but the time keeps slipping. I wasn’t tempted to hike on anyway. For the first time, my feet hurt!  Leaving town is always painful. First, there’s almost always a steep uphill. Second, food is heavy, oh so heavy.  In the grocery yesterday, I thought I bought the right amount.  Carrying it uphill, I had my doubts.","Duncannon

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590446,"The rains finally came last night.  The Scouts stayed outside but the leaders occupied the second floor of the shelter.  I got into my sleeping bag at 6, but the card games started and kept me awake until nearly 7:30!  Then, unfortunately, the snoring began.  I’m using the moldable silicone earplugs and the low frequencies are muted but still annoying. I’ll Google the topic the next time I’m in a town and see if there is something more effective, short of suffocating the snorers.  
I woke early and started hiking st 6:15, dressed in my rain suit over running shorts and t-shirt with my bright orange pack cover in place. For the first couple of hours, it was like hiking in a cloud. I usually take advantage of the privy at the shelter, but my body was not cooperative this morning, showing no signs of preferring the relative comfort of a toilet seat. Five miles out, my body announced in the strongest of terms that now was the time. Not five minutes from now but now. It was all I could do to remove the rain pants, grab my Big Dig trowel and toilet paper, and dash into woods. I wouldn’t have made it the 200’ called for under Leave-No-Trace guidelines and settled for 20’. The Big Dig, made from sharpened titanium, easily cut through roots and dug out a perfect 8” cat hole. I squatted over it, pleased that my quads did not complain, bunched up my shorts and spread my shoes.  With incredibly perfect timing, the second hiker to leave the shelter, Furnace,  chose that moment to catch up to me. It was a rather spectacular mooning.  I missed my shorts and my shoes, but also my cat hole.  I executed a perfect flip of the underlying leaves and all was well, looking as though no one had chosen that spot to do their business. My Big Dig is now inaugurated. 
I saw that a 1,000’ down followed by a 1,000’ up was coming up, so I left the rain pants off. On the climb, I met Sally Forth and Andrea who were slackpacking from the Rock ‘n’ Sole Hostel. Sally is slacking whenever she can.  Soon after, the rain started, quite heavily, and the temperature plunged into the 40’s. I wished that I had left my rain pants on. Instead I just sped up and got to the shelter about 1:30. My first 18 miler, and I moved well. The trail was much easier today, other than being flooded. I gave up trying to rock hop and avoid the mud and just walked straight down the center of the trail. My shoes and socks were soaked, so what was the point in pretending?  My fingers were so cold and wet that my iPhone wouldn’t work. I was delighted that the side trail to the shelter was well marked.  
Furnace, who is such a gentleman that he claims that he saw nothing of my embarrassment, was here first. We both changed into warm, dry clothes and decided to cook our hot dinners for lunch. I spilled mine. After cleaning up the mess, I ate a tuna fish sandwich, a couple sticks of cheese and a Pepperidge Farms Cookie. Sam, Reid (now Jelly), Ulysses and Rizz have come in, making for six of us, the capacity of the shelter. We think we could fit two more if necessary.  Yesterday, the water source was 300 steps steeply downhill, a trek I was able to avoid.  At Rausch Gap Shelter, there’s a piped spring 30” off the ground directly in front of the shelter, emptying into a stainless steel trough. 
Batgirl just came in at 5:00. We’ve squeezed her in, but eight may not be possible!  Oops, Kidska just came in, but she honestly prefers to tent. We would have squeezed her in somehow!","Peters Mountain Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590448,"There was certainly hiker togetherness last night with seven of us side-by-side in a shelter built for six. It continued to rain well into the night, and the shelter only leaked a little, over me and adjacent Jello. There was snoring, but not bad and I slept. I was on the far right of the shelter. Occasionally either Jello or I would turn over, bumping the other. Apologies were soon forgone, and it was kind of nice to be so close to another human. I dreamed of Willow who is now a half or even a full day behind. I miss her gentleness and smile. And I want to find out how her son Caleb did in the Conference track races. 
We all woke together, as though we had any choice, and once again I was the first out, followed by Furnace and Sam. Sam is now known as Baby Bird. He had Ramen last night and added dried sausage to it. Instead of using a knife, Sam would bite off a small piece, bend over his cook pot, and release it. The bobbing remind people of a bird.
It wasn’t raining this morning, but the fog was so thick that a pack cover was needed.  About an hour in, Furnace passed me and Baby Bird caught up. He is having a tough day after the 18 miles yesterday. I took two Aleve this morning and that seemed to help. The trail was still squishy wet and I was glad that I had put on my wet socks, instead of wasting my dry pair. For some time, the trail meandered through Pennsylvania Game Lands that had been proscriptively burned on May 9. In spite of the rain, the campfire-like smell persisted. At one point, I was surprised to see a white or very light squirrel scurrying away. It stood out brilliantly against the burnt vegetation. We are in a different trail maintaining territory today and the trail was poorly marked. I found myself confused at the top of a rock heap and had to resort to Guthook to relocate the trail. But first I tried exploring on my own. I was rewarded with a sighting of a pink lady slipper, one of our native orchids. There were also orange efts, looking like salamanders. Rain always seems to bring them out and we try hard not to step on them.  It would be very bad Trail Karma. There were long stretches of rocks, both large and small. Thanks to the rain, they were extremely slippery. I didn’t fall, but Baby Bird whacked he ankle pretty good, adding insult to what was already a bad day for him. 
The sun finally came out this afternoon, and we all took many breaks. Baby Bird may stay at the shelter before this one, William Penn. I hope he decides to come the addition 4 miles. The 501 Shelter was a Potter’s studio and is an enclosed building with bunk space for 12 and a skylight above where the wheel would have been. More importantly, we can order pizza from here!  There is potable water from a spigot on the side of the caretaker’s house, and I enjoyed an icy cold bandana bath, actually doing more than moving the dirt around. 
I also realized that my Scarpa Rapide shoes are nearly worn out after just two weeks, with the worst of Pennsylvania still to come. I placed an order for a more durable model with Zappos and they should be deliver tomorrow to the hotel in Lititz where I’ll be staying Wednesday and Thursday nights. I do look forward to seeing my friend Mike again and having my first zero day!
Now, it’s pizza time!","Rausch Creek Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590574,"Baby Bird made it into 501 Shelter last night, along with Bat Girl, Jelly, Rizz, Sally Forth, and Andrea, Ulysses missed the shelter trail and kept going, eventually phoning Rizz with some colorful language. A 1986 thru-hiker, Old Ridgerunner, stopped in for old time’s sake on his way to Damascus, Virginia for Trail Days, celebrated the weekend following Mothers’ Day. Festivities include a hiker parade by year, and he wanted to march. It’s supposed to be one great big party with lots of people. That many people scare me, especially if beer is involved. We invited him to eat with us. Counting Furnace and me, that was a total of nine. We figured five large pizzas and several large bottles of soft drinks. Beer can’t be delivered in Pennsylvania. At any rate, alcohol is not permitted in this shelter. We agreed on the toppings and Jelly phone the pizzeria that delivers to the 501 Shelter. It rang and rang until we checked the fine print and saw that they were closed on Mondays. Instant depression. Several people began Googling other places that might deliver. We even considered hiring a shuttle driver. Finally Old Ridgerunner took a hint and offered to drive if someone would navigate. We ordered the five pies from a pizzeria in Lebanon. Jelly went with Old Ridgerunner since he is from Pennsylvania and could speak the language. Finally they phoned as they neared the shelter parking area, for help carrying them in. No shortage of volunteers. The pizzeria threw in paper plates and napkins, so we had a civilized feast. Normally, at home, I would usually eat 1/4 of a frozen pizza.  But being on the trail is not normal. We each inhaled one-half of a large pizza. I had a slice each of veggie, meat lovers, pepperoni, and cheese, washed down with root beer. We also had good Pennsylvania potato chips!  I admit that I didn’t sleep very well with that much food in my tummy, but I would gladly do it again. 
After a piece of leftover pizza for breakfast, I headed out early at 6:15. The weather forecast showed thunderstorms starting at 1:00 and I had 15.1 miles to go. The others, along with Ulysses, were are going to Rock ‘n’ Sole Hostel, but I needed to be in Port Clinton tomorrow. This was my third consecutive big mileage day, and between a leaden belly, a poor night’s sleep and muscle soreness, it was slow going. It wasn’t helped by the treadway. When it wasn’t rocky — big and little rocks— the trail was flooded from the recent rains. Hikers had created ad hoc paths around the flooded ares, exasperating the problem. The quagmire will keep expanding until a proper trail is built or puncheon installed. This area had the same issues the last time I hiked Pennsylvania. Needless to say, my shoes and socks were soaked once again. It was also a hot day, up to 86 degrees, with the rocks radiating heat making it seem much hotter. The trail also went through another proscriptive burn area. I went down to two springs, Black Swatera and Sand Spring, to stay hydrated.  Shortly after Black Swatera Spring, i came upon the pictured pine tree that looks very much like an American Indian marker tree. The only problem is that it is only 10” in diameter, far too young to actually be one. It is right beside the trail. Could it have been injured in the original building of the AT?  
I reached Eagle’s Nest Shelter, on a 0.4 mile side trail off the AT about 2:15. There’s a single tent set up, presumably with a person in it, but I have yet to see them.  There’s also a large garbage bag full of trash that someone has gathered and hung. It’s too big for me to carry out. Now at 4;00, it’s getting very dark and windy. I am very grateful to be in this shelter made from whole logs. I have all the water I need and will be quite cozy while it rages outside.","501 Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590696,"The thunderstorm last night was quite intense, with up to 1/2” hail pelting the metal roof of the shelter.  I had set up my ground cloth, sleeping pad, and sleeping pad on the left side to catch the breezes, but when the rain started blowing sideways, I moved everything to the other side. By coincidence, the Gospel for Evening Prayer was from Matthew, about the disciples in a boat about to swamp in high seas. They feared for their lives and awoke Jesus who was calmly sleeping. He chided them for their lack of faith and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a dead calm. I wasn’t actually afraid because I knew I was in a sturdy structure, but nonetheless felt quite relieved when the storm passed as quickly as it had come. In its wake came three GAME thru-hikers, Transformer (from Australia), Willow (another Willow, from Berlin, Germany) and Landfill ( homegrown). We cooked and ate our dinners, then they all tented, leaving me the entire shelter.  Such luxury!
The tent I saw yesterday when I arrived proved to be empty and appears to have been abandoned. I reported it to ATC so someone can remove the tent and garbage. It’s waterlogged and much too heavy for me to carry!  I’m sure the local maintaining club has nearby road access. 
I started hiking at 6:15, hoping to do the 8.6 miles to Port Clinton by 10:00. The trail had other ideas. It rained all morning but it was in the upper 50’s, so that my rain suit felt good over shorts and t-shirt. The trail itself was in good shape with just enough long stretches of sharp, jagged rocks to remind me that I was still in Pennsylvania. There were lots of fresh blow downs from last night’s storm, but I could step over all but three of them. I took one tumble creating a bypass route, but it was more of a controlled fall. Highlights were seeing three does, that while wary, continued to browse as I passed by and two more pink lady slippers growing right alongside the trail. The final few hundred feet of descent into Port Clinton was steep with lots of stone steps.  In less than three weeks on the trail, my starting pair of Scarpa Rapide were nearly smooth on the bottom. They were as useful as ballet slippers in navigating the steep, slippery terrain.  When I finally completed the descent, I found myself facing several sets of railroad tracks without a white blaze in sight. I tried using Guthook, but my cold wet fingers were unable to activate my iPhone. I crossed the tracks and turned left on a pedestrian walkway painted on the asphalt. I flagged down a slowly approaching pickup truck and confirmed that i was on the trail. After crossing two rivers, fortunately on bridges, the blazes were back. An SUV stopped and the driver offered me a ride to the hiker pavilion that Port Clinton  built for hikers. I thanked the driver, but declined, explaining that I had to walk the entire trail. Yes, even in the rain. 
I arrived on the porch of the Port Clinton Hotel at 10:50 to find that they don’t open until 11:00. By the time I had stripped off my rain gear and shoes, they were open. For $8, I showered in a clean bathroom with soap, shampoo and a fluffy towel and put on my cleaner hiking clothes. I had a bacon cheeseburger, their truly excellent hand-cut fries and a Yuengling Lager.  My friend Mike, who is among other things, an architectural historian and advocate of urban communities, arrived at 12:15 like a knight on white charger to rescue me from Port Clinton.  I had him stop at the nearby Cabela’s, supposedly their largest store. I didn’t find what I was looking for, a picaridin-based insect repellent supposedly more effective than DEET against black footed ticks, but we did find a paradise of taxidermy, at least for the hunters. No need to walk through the rainy woods for the sighting of three measly white-tailed deer!  Come to Cabela’s and see elk, grizzlies and wolves!  All in air-conditioned comfort.  Feast in the carnivore’s delight restaurant!  Mike was appalled and more than willing to run through the rain to his car. I had had my fill of walking in the rain today and waited in the porte cochère.  
The Holiday Inn Express in Lititz is luxurious especially by trail standards. I bathed and showered again during the wash cycle. During the dry cycle, I spread my gear all over the room to dry. I’ll tidy up in the morning so I’m not exposed as trail trash.  We dined at the Bulls Head Public House in Lititz, an award-winning beer pub, and a far cry from my usual Knorr’s side and tuna pouch.   I had planned only one zero day, tomorrow, but the forecast for Friday is so dismal — up to 3” of rain and possible flash floods — that I’ve decided to extend it to two zero days!  It’s a justification, however meager, for what I really want to do!  The new Scarpa Epic Lite shoes fit well — I replaced the insoles with my green Superfeet — but they could do with a little breaking in. They are substantially more rigid with a much gnarlier Vibram sole. The worst of the Pennsylvania rocks are still to come.  Yippee!","Eagle’s Nest Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590945,"Jack Graves asks how my bear canister is working out.  I remain committed to it. The only downside is its weight, two pounds, equivalent to a day’s food. Leaving town usually means a long uphill, and I feel the weight. After a couple of days of eating, I don’t. The biggest plus is not having to hang my food at night to keep it safe not only from bears but also from raccoons (not Rocky), squirrels and mice.  I have yet to see anyone execute a proper Pacific Coast Trail hang out here. The one perfect tree along the AT for this purpose continues to prove elusive. More and more shelters offer alternatives to hanging: poles in MD, occasional cables, and bear boxes. It bothers me, however, that the burden of keeping our food safe is falling on the maintaining clubs. My logic, taken to an extreme, would also exclude shelters, privies, marked springs and even the trail itself. So I feel conflicted. The human dilemma, caught between the horns of idealism and pragmatism.  Another advantage of the canister is that I can carry things like Pepperidge Farms Cookies without their being crushed.  I also love not having to embarrass myself or risk injury attempting to throw a rock bag over a limb.  A more athletically gifted hiker might enjoy the latter.  
I carry the canister vertically in the top one-third of my pack, with stuff packed along its sides.  I can access its contents without removing it from my pack. When I tent, the canister makes a nice seat, especially with a small piece of Z-rest pad on it. 
Bear canisters are not popular on the AT and probably won’t be until mandatory, but that raises the issue of enforcement. How would you do it?  So far, I’ve met one section hiker using one and one other thru- hiker, Andrea, with a slightly smaller model of the Bearicade that I use. 
My primary argument that I’m carrying the canister for the bears’ sake falls on hollow ears out here. “In all my years of backpacking, I’ve never had a bear get my food” or “I use my food bag as my pillow and never had a problem.”  I try not to debate the issue, but it only takes one instance of a bear getting human food to possibly doom the bear to eventual euthanasia. Carrying a canister strikes me as the responsible thing to do, but I’m not out here to evangelize my fellow hikers. Hike your own hike; carry your own s%*#. 
After two days of wearing my new hiking shoes, they feel fairly well broken in. My toes are healing nicely from all the arrested slides caused by my former shoes that wore out in under three weeks.  The new ones seem to provide excellent traction, and I’m hoping they will allow me to hike with confidence again. 
It’s been great visiting with my friend Mike. We spent most of yesterday in Wayne, on the Main Line between Philadelphia and Lancaster. Mike is considering buying property there. It’s a very wealthy community offering a short train commute into central Philly.  The entire unincorporated town is heavily forested but on closer inspection I realized that this isn’t a native forest but a masterpiece of landscape architecture on the scale of Frederick Law Olmstead, a lovely English landscape absent any danger.  Copper beeches and azaleas add splashes of color. Trees and shrubs crowd the narrow roadways and along with speed humps calm traffic.  We visited Chanticleer Gardens on the Rosengarten Estate, now operated by a foundation but built with the help of a pharmaceutical fortune from a company that later merged with Merck.  Even in the rain, the beauty and attention to detail was awe-inspiring. There were some centuries old trees but most date only to the founding of the gardens and are carefully placed for maximum effect.  Nice to see that some good came from inflated drug prices!  We went into Wayne Presbyterian Church built in 1912, quite a grand structure. A student ensemble was rehearsing what I think was a Bach flute concerto. The acoustics and professionalism of these student musicians were both outstanding. We also visited the old church of St David’s Episcopal built in 1715 with old style boxed family pews. I wondered where guests would be seated.  In the penalty box?  Wayne is blessed with a small independent bookstore with a carefully curated inventory. In 15 minutes, I spotted more books that I wanted to read than in an afternoon in Barnes & Noble. If I lived in Wayne, I would be a regular.  We had lunch at Autograph Brasserie, one of the best salads of my life. Wonderfully fresh greens with gobs of creamy goat cheese, fresh figs and berries and cubed tender chicken breast with just enough tangy vinaigrette. Mike is gluten-intolerant so I enjoyed both his and my herbed fresh focaccia with olive oil.  I should have had a glass of Sancerre instead of water!
Today, we visited Pennsbury Manor, a reconstruction of William Penn’s 17th Century Manor on the original site on the bank of the Delaware River 26 miles north of Philadelphia. Penn was exposed to Quakerism while living on his father’s estate in Ireland and went public with his faith at age 23.  His father, an admiral highly placed in society, was not pleased, but young Penn was resolute, boldly publishing and preaching his convincements, earning himself lodging in the Tower of London for a time.  To settle a debt to the admiral, King Charles gave William the lands between Maryland and New York. Penn attempted to apply his idealism to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, insisting upon religious tolerance, trial by a jury of peers and representative government. Witches were not burned in Pennsylvania. Penn envisioned a series of manors along the Delaware but soon found his ideals in conflict with the pragmatism of a tightly gridded city.  See, we all carry our bear canisters!  Unlike his Puritan neighbors to the north, Penn did not see the forest as the refuge of evil savages, the spawn of Satan. He believed the natives to be a lost tribe of Israel and worthy of respect and discourse.  Treaties were kept.  When ordered to field a militia in the French and Indian War, the pacifist Quakers had little recourse but to step aside from colonial governance. Back to bear canisters, weighing faith against duty to the Crown.   
I will resolve all of my inner conflicts tomorrow by returning to the trail, where there are few decisions more complicated than which flavor Ramen or pasta side to eat.  Two days in civilization and I long to be wet, muddy, dirty, smelly and hungry again.","Port Clinton, PA

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591040,"I went down for the Holiday Inn Express breakfast this morning and saw that the Royal Wedding had started. I confess to turning on the TV when I returned to my room.  After just three weeks without it, TV seemed like the most amazing thing I had ever seen. Like most Episcopalians, I love good liturgy and all the pomp and ceremony that, even though we know means nothing, is so beautiful and inspiring. It didn’t make me want to trade in my Tom for a Harry, but I wouldn’t mind a spin in that carriage. 
It was raining when Mike pulled up at 8:35. We drove to West Reading and had a delightful brunch at a restaurant owned by his sister, Marty, called The Farmhouse Kitchen and furnished with things from her farmhouse when she had a horse farm. I had the Jalapeño Business, whole grain toast points covered in house-made jalapeño jelly and an assortment of seeds and nuts, along with a pot of the best Earl Grey Tea I’ve ever had. I loved meeting Marty and seeing how her staff simultaneously loved her and respected her.  Outside, West Reading celebrated Armed Forces Day, a holiday that was new to me, with a parade of bands, Gold Star Moms, and military units. I appreciate the heartfelt patriotism of the town, but I never react well to massed men in uniforms.  I know I should feel all safe and protected and proud, but I must have been sick when that lesson was taught. 
We got to Port Clinton a little after noon, and I started hiking dressed in my full rain suit over running shorts and t-shirt. The trail starts by following the Little Schuykill River that was in flood from all the rain. Then the trail gains 1,000’ in elevation over about 1.5 miles to regain the ridge. After two zero days, I never even broke a sweat on the climb even with my rain suit. There were a few rocky areas, enough to test my new shoes. I was no longer a ballet dancer but a mountain goat and felt sure-footed. Yah!  I covered the 6.1 miles in about 2.5 hours and felt like I could easily have gone on. I decided to stop, however, for a few reasons. First, I felt lazy. Second, I didn’t want to risk blisters in new shoes. Finally, stopping here sets me up for three 16-17 mile days that are just the right length for this stage in my hike. 
Thunderstorms are forecast for tonight but after a few morning showers tomorrow, mostly good weather is forecast for the next 10 days with just showers and thundershowers.  Oma, a student at Allegheny College in Pennsylvania has come in. She is just out for tonight and intended to hike to the next shelter but got confused in following the trail. She will hammock. SOS, another flip flop thru-hiker has also arrived, after holing up in Port Clinton during the storms. He says the town was crowded with many doing the same. I wonder if my tramily is ahead of it behind me.  SOS is a recent high school graduate. He and I are staying in the shelter. A section hiker Dean is tenting below. Windsor Forge Shelter was built in the 1970’s and shows its age. There are many worse shelters and also many in better condition. It is built of whole logs and the chinking is in good condition.  There are not many opportunities for mice to set up housekeeping. 
As much as I enjoyed my time with Mike and even watching parts of the Royal Wedding, I am very happy to be out here in the woods again. It’s where I belong.","Port Clinton, PA

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591257,"I slept well last night and awoke with the birds a little past 5. It warmed up last night and it wasn’t raining this morning, but I still left my pack cover on. The trees were dripping with each breeze. No more than 1/4 mile from the shelter I found fresh bear scat, a very large mound. It wasn’t steaming, but the flies hadn’t found it yet. I could smell a slight skunky odor that could have been bear, but I never saw it. The 1,000’ climb up to Pulpit Rock went quickly and except for the area around Pulpit Rock, the trail was not unduly rocky and I made good time. The descent to Eckville Shelter was along an old road and super fast. I took an early lunch at the shelter, used the flush toilet, and emptied my trash bag. Almost immediately the rocks began. It was warm and I found the 1,000’ up to Dan’s Pulpit tiring. There had been nothing but fog for a view at Pulpit Rock but it was somewhat better at Dan’s Pulpit but still hazy. Except for a couple of short sections, the trail was predominantly rock. The photo is typical. My hiking sticks are about four feet in length for scale. Any fall had the potential for serious injury, so I didn’t hurry. My speed on the worst of it was reduced to under 1 MPH. 
About a mile from Allentown Hiking Club Shelter, I met Andrea and her son 14-year old son Connor.   Andrea is having ankle pain. She thinks it’s a tendon on the front of her ankle.   Our friendly day hiker from several days ago showed up. Thunder Belly offered to take Andrea’s pack, but she refused. I went ahead since she had Connor and TB for support. Sally Forth was at the shelter. The rest of my friends had started at Eckville Shelter today after a night in a B&B and continued past Allentown Shelter three miles to a road and another B&B. Baby Bird and Ulysses left word that they would buy me a beer if I made it. Not even that incentive was enough.  16.5 rocky miles is quite enough. I am sore and tired. Naturally the water is about 0.3 miles downhill, but the spring is quite grand. Gushing like a fire hydrant is too mild a description!  Taking a Buff bath cheered me up. 
I tried a new flavor of Knorr’s tonight, Mexican Rice, with a pouch of salmon. Yum. Cookies for dessert. SOS made it and has a fine photo of a timber rattlesnake tucked back in the rocks. I wonder how many I passed!  I couldn’t find a level tent site, so I am in the shelter, beneath Sally Forth’s bunk

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591298,"For once, I wasn’t the first one up. That honor belongs to Charlie Horse and Reboot, both thru-hikers who started in Georgia. Reboot is from North Carolina, Andy Griffith’s hometown, and recently retired. He’s looking to reboot his life. Charlie Horse is from Texas and has the drawl to prove it. His age is somewhere between 60 and death. I was the first one on the trail. The first six miles were a pleasure. Then the trail decided to follow the ridge, meaning large sharp boulders to be gotten over or around. There were two short stretches of those and then good trail again to lull me into complacency. Then came the Knife Edge, which as the name suggests is a long very narrow ridge of even larger, sharper boulders. The view of the valley below was excellent, but my eyes were focused on the Rocks. Looking down scared me and it isn’t the kind of place where I could afford to be scared. A fall, assuming you didn’t break your back or crack your skull, would mean a broken arm or leg. It was well blazed with the optimal trail marked, so at least there wasn’t a need to find my own route. The trail then improved and I joined Charlie Horse and Reboot for lunch at Bake Oven Knob Shelter. They are slightly faster than I am.  At Ashfield Road, there was trail magic by General Store of West Chester, PA.  I enjoyed a cherry Coke, a fresh tangerine, and an oatmeal raisin cookie. I also refilled my water bottle. I really enjoyed being able to sit in a camp chair!  General Store also offered a recharging station and all manner of snacks. The trail to Outerbridge Shelter remained good. Kidska and Bat Girl were here. The boys (Jelly, Baby Bird, Rizz and Ulysses) are about 1/2 day ahead. Bat Girl decided to move on to a hostel in Palmerton, but Kidska will keep me company. I expect SOS to come in as well. We are very near Lehigh Gap, the Superfund Site. Palmerton is on the Lehigh River. 
Several people saw rattlesnakes today. I only saw a five foot black snake, three does and a toad. I really enjoyed the sun today and give thanks to General Store.","Allentown Hiking Club Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591459,"The only thing more fun than navigating a long steep rock scramble is doing it in the rain. I’m not ashamed to say that I was scared. Not as much as at the Knife Edge yesterday. A fall today would probably have only meant a sprain or possibly a broken bone, but not death.  The remediation effort at Lehigh Gap is really making progress. It used to be a moonscape once you made the climb, with very few living plants. Now it looks like a young forest. Cadmium is the primary pollutant but there are other heavy metals as well. I hope no one is tempted by the blueberries that ought to ripen in another month. 
I intended to sleep in this morning, even to the extent of waking up at 3 to pee. Reboot and Charlie Horse had another idea, getting up st 5. Then about 5:15 an alarm went off that sounded like the first three notes of Jingle Bells. None of us could find the device. Possibly it had been tossed under the shelter as a cruel joke. 
The rain came in showers today, especially heavy this afternoon.  I wore my rain jacket over shorts, but had to take the jacket off for the climb. Better to be drenched with rain than with sweat.  After the climb, the trail followed a road that is being used in the remediation effort, but then the treadway reverted to typical NE Pennsylvania, rocks of all sizes, including a couple of short scrambles.  I met some interesting southbound hikers, including Moses, Doc Holiday, and Twig.  Moses and Twig started on Katahdin last year and hope to finish in Georgia this year. Doc plans to take the blue-blazed bypass trail around the Lehigh Gap scramble. I can’t say that I blame him. Going up was hard enough. Coming down it in the rain would be downright dangerous. 
Sorry for no photo today. I can’t get my iPhone to unlock when the screen and my fingers are wet. Before going to sleep last night, I was aware of how dirty and smelly I am. I found myself wishing for a shower. I won’t call it a prayer, but next time I’ll be more specific and ask for a hot shower. It’s 4:30, and I’m dressed in my long underwear and possum fur socks and in my sleeping bag. I’ve still not warmed up from today’s hike. I was planning to do a quick in and out into Wind Gap tomorrow, but my body is screaming for an easy day. Weather looks good for tomorrow and I am now thinking about a near zero “Nero” day tomorrow, just about 5 miles into Wind Gap and spend the night. There’s a motel, a laundromat, a grocery, Italian restaurant and a Chinese Restaurant. Sounds like paradise to me!

At the road crossing before the shelter, General Store was leaving a large water carboy for hikers, to save them the trouble of going way down to the springs I certainly appreciate it on a day like this.  With her were Sally Forth and Bat Girl who sat out the rain.  They gave me the news that Andrea and Connor are returning home to Nashville.  Andrea’s ankle is too sore to hike  Pennsylvania is certainly taking a toll on us Flip-Floppers!
Baby Bird was here when I arrived this afternoon. He waited for the rain to stop and is hiking another five miles to a campsite, positioning him to arrive in Delaware Water Gap tomorrow. I’ll be a day behind him. Charlie Horse and Reboot, bring hardened Northbound thru-hikers will do the 20 miles to the Gap tomorrow. It will still be there for me on Wednesday.","George Outerbridge Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591593,"It would do me some good to read my tag line from Will Hutchins occasionally. I’ve been keeping something from you and more importantly from myself.  Three day ago, I started to sneeze occasionally and had to clear my throat often. It was worse at night, and last night it was pretty bad. Even so, I was no noisier than my shelter mates and the severe thunderstorm just after midnight covered all of our sounds. I even felt like my chest was constructed some and heard an occasional wheeze. I had been planning on resupplying in Wind Gap anyway, but my original plan was a quick in & out and to continue hiking to a shelter only 6.4 miles from Delaware Water Gap. So much for my plans. 
I woke up this morning feeling pretty puny, meaning feeling like I had a hangover only I hadn’t been drinking. The 4.6 miles to Wind Gap were rocky, but not unusually so for Pennsylvania. For me they felt endless. When I got to the trailhead, there was a car across the road letting a hiker out. I motioned to him, sort of a pantomime of going into town?  He did a u-turn and within minutes I was on my way to the Travel Inn. I instantly recognized that my driver was from Ghana, of the Ashanti tribe, which amazed him. I had a professor and neighbor from Accra and they could have been brothers. He will take me back to the trail tomorrow morning. 
On a scale of trail hotels with the Doyle of Duncannon as a 1 and Dartmouth’s Hanover Inn as a 10, the Travel Inn ranks right on up there as a two. The bathroom was recently renovated and was tolerably clean. The innkeeper gave me a bottle of body wash to supplement the condom foil-sized bit of shampoo in the room and the miniature bar of soap. The towel was adequate for drying but not for wrapping around my waist. I checked the mattress for bedbugs and found none. There is a refrigerator and a microwave, and also a satellite TV that will remain off. There is an air conditioner, but no where to plug it in. It is obviously intended as art and to fill the hole that would otherwise be in the wall. Fortunately it isn’t a very warm day and I’m better off without the noise. My room is in the rear annex, sparing me the noise of traffic. It’s really a blessing that the windows don’t open. To the credit of the Travel Inn, they are centrally located 1/2 mile from both St Luke’s Walk-In Clinic and the Giant Grocery Store. And they did let me check in early at 9:30. The laundromat is in a very close by strip center, and the owner was helpful and friendly. 
After showering and doing laundry, I went to St Luke’s. Aside from the waiting, they were quite nice and caring. Medicare and my supplemental covered it all. Their conclusion was not surprising. I have an upper respiratory infection, what I ignorantly would have called a cold. Remember the ancient ad, “A Summer Cold is a Different Beast!”  It’s one of those. The physician’s assistant is having me double up on my allergy spray, add a Zyrtec before bed to dry me out and prescribed an Albuterol inhaler. I must say that the latter already has me breathing much easier.  They took my vital signs. I’ve lost 12 pounds in just over three weeks!   The cold is suppressing my appetite but I managed beef & broccoli, fried rice, an egg roll and a large bowl of hot & sour soup for a late lunch. I’m cleared to hike on tomorrow, but I will carry an extra day’s food just in case I don’t feel like hiking the whole 15 miles into Delaware Water Gap tomorrow. My recollection is that the worst of the rocks ended at Wind Gap. If so, I’ll probably make it and try for a slightly nicer motel tomorrow. There is a church hostel at the Gap but I’m not feeling like being around other people. 
I’m sort of proud of myself for listening to my body, albeit belatedly. Now I must force myself to eat dinner although I don’t feel hungry.  The nearby Gap Diner is open 24 hours and gets great reviews for their comfort food. Housemade chicken noodle soup, side salad, grilled cheese and fries all served by a friendly waitress hit the spot. That ought have me cured by morning.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591719,"Way back on October 18, I related the story of my being treated as a homeless person by the patrons of Worthington’s Bakery at Culver Gap in New Jersey. I was seated on the sidewalk, leaning against the storefront, enjoying fresh doughnuts, coffee and juice, when pious church goers emerged with flats of cinnamon buns. I had written doughnuts, but I was mistaken. Two of them assumed I was homeless and flipped me quarters, earning my most sincere God Bless You’s. This afternoon, in Delaware Water Gap, I learned more about the story of Worthington’s Bakery. But first I have to get here. 
I didn’t sleep well last night in my unairconditioned deluxe accommodations at the Travel Inn. I won’t say that I woke up, more just got tired of lying there and got up. My cold still raged, but a hot shower helped a good deal. About 6, I walked over to the Gap Diner, planning to get something light, my appetite still suppressed. Instead I ordered one of the specials, a sausage and cheddar omelette, home fries (the really good ones that have lots of golden crunchiness from the grill), whole wheat toast and coffee. It may have been the caffeine, but I started to feel better and cleaned my plate. I went back and loaded up my pack, moving to a chair in front of the office to await Lofi, my Ghanaian driver from yesterday. 8:15, the agreed upon time past, but I figured that he was on West African time and waited another 25 minutes. I phoned him at 8:40. Hadn’t I gotten the message?  He was unable to keep the appointment and had arranged for the motel to drive me to the trail at his cost, since I had prepaid him yesterday. No, I didn’t receive the message, but yes they did and I arrived at the trailhead at 9:00, feeling puny, as they say in the South, and needing to hike 15.5 miles. 
I met Turtle, a mid-40’s thru hiker at the trailhead and we walked together up the steep hill and for about an hour. He works at ski resorts in Colorado and is thinking of relocating to Vermont. Walking with someone took my mind off my nose and throat. The trail was rocky in places but not unduly so for Pennsylvania.  He moved ahead eventually and I hiked at a slower pace, stopping for lunch in a clearing along the trail with a comfortable rock. I enjoyed some of the food I bought yesterday, a fresh sesame seed bagel with sopressata and a Gruyere cheese blend stick. A bit after lunch, Turtle came up behind me and we walked together until we met Kidska, part of my tramily. Kidska received her degree in chemical engineering from Ohio State University and is taking time to hike the Trail before entering the work force. She is more brilliant than she realizes and what the old novels used to term a boon companion. She’s a bit slower than I am, because she sees more, and a slower hiking speed is just what I needed with the way I was feeling. We even sat on a bench by Lake Lenape outside of Delaware Water Gap, enjoying an antic young Labrador Retriever intent on repeating rescuing a rubber ball, and northern water snakes cavorting in the shallows. 
I had emailed the Deer Head Inn in DWG hoping to stay there tonight, but had no answer and their telephone went unanswered. We stopped there and I was delighted to be accepted in a small queen room. It is exquisite, like a B&B, with a spacious walk-in shower and generous supplies of soap, shampoo and conditioner. The room air condition works quietly and the bed is marvelously firm with a cushion top. I was also offered access to their washer and drier. I feel a little guilty. Kidska and the others are staying at the hiker hostel run by the Presbyterian Church of the Mountain. The Deer Head Inn was built as an Inn in the mid-19th century and became a jazz club in the 1950’s. It is America’s oldest continually operating jazz club!
After showering, I quickly walked down to the outfitter for a gas canister. They close at six and wouldn’t reopen until 10 in the morning. I hope to be hiking by then. I remembered that the DWG Diner was around the corner and walked over to see what time it opened for breakfast. It had been renamed the Apple Pie Café and looked closed. I went over to the adjacent Apple Pie Bakery, having fond memories from my last visit in DWG. One man looked both jovial and official. Charlie Cooper is the owner of both and for the moment the café is closed. The bakery serves breakfast starting at 8AM, and I’m not leaving town without it. We kept talking and I found out that his grandfather Mr Worthington had started his Bakery at Culver Gap, New Jersey, based on the fame of his cinnamon buns. The bakery had been transferred to his son not too long before I enjoyed their doughnuts. Charlie himself never baked the cinnamon buns, and still won’t, since it would mean waking up at 2AM. Instead he is famous for his pies. He shared his travails if searching for a healthier alternative to lard for his crusts. He thinks that he had found it in cottonseed oil. I’ll judge for myself tomorrow, after I enjoy one of his breakfast sandwiches. He also encouraged me to explore Kittatinny Ridge above Culver Gap for family momentos.  The only time the cinnamon buns are made now are for Worthington family reunions. I regret that I never tried one that Sunday morning 20 years ago 
I walked back up to the Deer Head Inn, started a load of laundry, and went down for dinner. Ah, ecstasy!  A cup of gazpacho that is better than mine and a broiled lobster tail salad, with the lobster perfectly done. Mindful of St Benedict who prescribed red wine for ill monks, I enjoyed a perfectly balanced glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. It actually burned my throat at first but the pain was replaced with a mellow warmth. I can hear that the jazz sets have started below. It’s a pickup night. I am ignorant of jazz, but my mind is open and my palette open as well to a local beer.  I feel like I will sleep well tonight and put this cold behind me quickly.I will pass through Culver’s Gap on Sunday, visiting a local diner and grocery. I’ll reflect on the Worthington family and try to imagine young Charlie Cooper playing on the ridge","Wind Gap, PA

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591800,"I know nothing about jazz, but I appreciated the virtuosity of the pianist, bassist and drummer who made up last night’s ensemble.  The young bassist showed no emotion on his face, but it came through clearly in his playing. Cool jazz?  
It’s easy to make fun of New Jersey, especially if all you have seen of it is the I-95 corridor between Newark Airport and Manhattan. I won’t pretend that it’s my favorite state, but I’ll proclaim enthusiastically that at least it’s not Pennsylvania. For that I give most hearty thanks. There are rocks in New Jersey, but they are Jersey rocks and not Pennsylvania rocks.  The difference?  Pennsylvania rocks are sharp. New Jersey rocks are smooth and easy to walk on. 
I waited until the Apple Pie Bakery opened at 8 for breakfast, a fine egg and cheese sandwich with sausage. I didn’t have room for the slice of apple pie that I really wanted, my appetite still suppressed by my cold. The trail crosses the Delaware River on a highway bridge that bounces when heavy trucks pass.  The state line is marked on the sidewalk in undramatic fashion, almost lost in clutter of signs offering suicide prevention counseling. A high curved fence would prevent a jumper from landing on train tracks or a highway, but the river remains fair target. 
After crossing the river, the trail ascends gradually through the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area and New Jersey’s Worthington Forest, named after our favorite cinnamon bun purveyor. It being the start of a long holiday weekend, there were people everywhere, including a very large group of boys and teenagers ending their overnight. At one point, I saw three of them jump back after they spotted a small timber rattlesnake, only about three feet long. I took photos, but he was so well camouflaged that I can’t see him in the photos. He rattled and moved off the trail and was not overly aggressive.  Nonetheless, the boys were impressed. I don’t know why it is, but the only state in which I routinely see trash on the trail is New Jersey.  I prevailed on three separate groups of kids to carry out candy wrappers and four separate well used socks.  They took the objects reluctantly, perhaps just to humor me, and I suspect they tossed them back on the trail once I was out of sight  Shortly after the snake sighting, Baby Bird caught up with me and we walked together most of the day. We stopped at an overlook with 360 degree views of the Delaware River to the west and a reservoir to the east. There was a large group of first year medical students from the University of Pennsylvania.  Baby Bird and I took the 0.3 road to The Mohican Center, operated by the Appalachian Mountain Club of Beacon Hill, Boston. There was no room in the Inn, as I had been told on the phone earlier, but we ordered sandwiches. I could eat only half of my turkey club and carried out half for dinner. I filled all of my water containers, about 2.5 liters, and slowly walked another two miles to the old Catfish Fire Tower where I am now tented. There’s a nice breeze, soft grass and a picnic table. Once the sun sets a little more, it should cool down and be a very pleasant evening. Lotus and Ibex stopped by to visit on their way to the next campsite by Rattlesnake Spring. I thought of hiking the additional 0.7 miles, but I don’t need water and staying here improved the odds of my having a quiet night.  The medical students just passed, planning to tent at the spring, making me very glad to be tenting by the fire tower!  
I’m feeling much improved over yesterday and tomorrow I will be better still, especially if I have a good night’s sleep without awakening to sneeze or to cough. I’m grateful for my recovering health!  It’s one thing to struggle on in ordinary life with a cold and quite another to carry a 25 pound pack for 12-15 miles.","Deer Head Inn, Delaware Water Gap

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591879,"If Pennsylvania is the state for rocks, perhaps New Jersey is the state for venomous reptiles. Yesterday I saw a timber rattlesnake. Today a pair of copperheads were mating on the trail, oblivious to passing hikers. There’s only one species of venomous New Jersey reptile occasionally found in the woods that I have yet to see - the politician. 
I was in my tent by 7 last night just drifting off to sleep when a whippoorwill decided to let blast with its namesake call. Whippoorwill. Whippoorwill. Every three seconds. Then I heard a late hiker come through. Perhaps it was just coincidence. Perhaps they stepped on the bird. Whatever happened, the whippoorwill ceased its crazed call and the rest of the night was peaceful. I slept better than anytime since the onset of this cold, and started hiking about 6:15. I started sweating and drinking large amounts of water almost immediately. It reached the upper 80’s this afternoon. The hiking itself was rather routine with some excellent views. The rocks are tapering off and the worst of them today was still better than the best of the last four days in Pennsylvania. I enjoyed meeting a very taciturn thru-hiker who started in Georgia. Cody Coyote is from Cumberland Gap, Tennessee and this is his fifth or sixth consecutive thru-hike, including two in one year!  He speaks so little that I doubt that many of his fellow Nobo’s have a clue. He was suffering from a sore ankle tendon, having averaged 23 miles per day in Pennsylvania! He stopped for the day at a campsite about three miles before Brink Road Shelter. I also enjoyed meeting a day hiker Lisa from Long Beach Island, New Jersey. She is smitten with the idea of a thru hike, but her employer refuses to even consider a leave of absence. 
At about 12:15, I arrived at the Brink Road Shelter that was remodeled in 2013 to be greeted by three corpulent 30-something corporate types from Connecticut dressed in nothing more than their boxer shorts.  It isn’t a good look for them, but they told me of an easier way to access the spring than by the blue blazed trail. A southbound section hiker came in for lunch and water.  Thanks to his information I can skip a side trip to the grocery tomorrow and wait until Unionville, New York on Monday. 
I am enjoying staying out of the heat this afternoon and resting. I bathed at the spring and washed out my hiking clothes. If I felt this way at home, I wouldn’t even think of going to the Y to workout, yet I hiked a dozen miles this morning. The ups are hard for me with the congestion. I had planned for some easy days in New Jersey to allow my body to recover from the rocks of Pennsylvania. They are doing double duty now. Can I blame my cold on Pennsylvania?  
I noticed a giant boulder setting in a grassy area today with no other rocks close by.  I think it’s my first glacial erratic, a boulder that was entrapped in the moving ice sheet and then left behind when the ice retreated. I kind of feel that way myself today, as my trail friends get further and further ahead of me","Tentsite at Catfish Fire Tower

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592126,"This would have been a fine day to stay in bed, calling room service for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Brinks Road Shelter was very nice, and I had it all to myself, but room service was not an option. My Neoair mattress is comfortable as far as sleeping pads go, but it doesn’t encourage indolence. When I wake up and accept the inevitability of a new day, I reach behind my right shoulder and open the mattress valve. When the hissing has ended and my back is feeling the wooden shelter floor or a rock beneath my tent, there’s a certain imperative to getting up. Needing to pee only accelerates the process. 
At least the forecasted rain showers hadn’t materialized overnight. I could hear thunderstorms in the early morning hours but the only sound to greet me at 5:00 was bird calls. The air was heavy and still, warm and suffocating. I didn’t think twice about either putting on my pack cover or not donning my rain jacket.  A nice brief shower would have felt so good. What we got, however, about 30 minutes into my hike, was not a brief shower but a heavy cloud burst for about an hour, leaving me cold and thoroughly drenched.
When I got down to Culver’s Gap, I didn’t expect to find anything open where I might enjoy a hot breakfast, but to the West, I could see a neon open sign. I walked down the highway only to find a fishing shop with bins and bins of artificial lures and flies.  The only fresh food was nightcrawlers and shiners. I wasn’t tempted but a minute and returned to the trail disappointed. I could have walked a mile to a diner in the other direction, but it just seemed too far when I had already eaten bacon on tortilla. 
I stopped to filter water from the stream by Gren Anderson Shelter. It was lightly tannin colored but tasted fine. Then I stopped for my morning snack at Sunrise Picnic Pavilion atop Sunrise Mountain, where I met a ridge runner. ATC granted the State of New Jersey funds for three ridgerunners along the Appalachian Trail. They have no law enforcement powers, but try to educate trail users in Leave No Trace. They also perform light trail maintenance, pick up trash, and deconstruct fire rings at the shelters. Open fires are not permitted in New Jersey.  The Sunrise Pavilion is popular with locals, especially on a Sunday morning, because there is road access to a parking area just below the Pavilion.  I met a nice couple who offered me a snack. We had been talking about Trail magic and it might have seemed like a clever Yogi to them. I fear they felt obligated to offer me something, so I declined. Magic should be freely given. Besides, I had just eaten my snack. 
I stopped at Mashipacong Shelter for lunch, about 30 minutes later. The ridgerunner came in and deconstructed its fire ring, finding the cremains of some fraction of an animal, possibly a rabbit. By now it was lightly raining again, a gentle mist, that lasted the 2.6 miles to the side trail to Rutherford Shelter. It’s nearly 1/2 mile off the trail, probably the farthest I’ve ever walked from the trail for a Shelter. I’m hoping the distance will keep the numbers down tonight, especially since the rain continues.  It’s an older shelter set in a grassy meadow. There’s a well-maintained moldering privy, a bear box, and access to a clear running stream very near the shelter. A thru hiker from a couple of years ago, Sandy, and her friend Mickey have come in. 
After a couple hours of hiking, my lungs cleared this morning and I felt like myself again, walking up the hills without concern. Today was 15 miles and I felt like I could easily have gone on. Tomorrow will be only 11.7 miles to Unionville, NY where I can reprovision and spend the night in the town pavilion. Perhaps Tuesday, I’ll try a 20 mile day and declare myself healthy once more.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592154,"Last night, Sandy and Mickey were the perfect sheltermates. The two of them are what remains of a sizable hiking club after 28 years. They know each other very well and the two of them had the trail equivalent of a slumber party. They both have low pitched voices and spoke very softly.  From across the shelter, I couldn’t make out their conversation and it was like the perfect white noise, like a babbling brook.  It got chilly last night, in the low 50’s, so I got into my sleeping bag early. Between the chill and the white noise, I was out quickly, barely awakening when Sasha, a nice young man from Manhattan, came in at the unreasonably late hour of 7.  For the first time in days, ever since I caught cold, I slept soundly through the night until 5AM. 10 hours of sleep is what I need out here!  
I was hiking at six this morning, grateful for the cool weather, my pack nearly empty of food.  The trail continued to follow the Kittatlnny Ridge until High Point when it descended sharply on switchbacks to pasture land and swamp land, leaving most rocks behind. There is a viewing platform at High Point supposedly with great 360-degree views, but not in the dense fog that enveloped the trail this morning. Close your eyes, and imagine that all you can see is gray, in every direction. Good, now you’ve seen the same view I did. I stopped at High Point Shelter for a break, meeting a guy who had previously thru-hiked, who had been given the trail name Mother.  I didn’t ask why. Mother had a very friendly dog who wishes that I had been friendlier about sharing my snacks. 
On the final climb before reaching Lott Road that leads to Unionville, someone behind me called, “Ken!  Sugarfoot!”  It took me only seconds to recognize his Hungry Cat hat. Willow had told him that I was a day ahead, so he’s been accosting perfect strangers, accusing them of being me.  I am so happy to have met him!  I’ve mentioned him before in my journal. I think he has the best trail journal of the year, including mine. Willow said it well. He has become one with the trail. We walked together the short distance to Lott Road. Hungry Cat had just resupplied, so he didn’t need to come into town. He is every bit as nice on first meeting as he is in his journal. Go, Hungry Cat!  Yesterday I had heard that he was two days ahead of me. I was carrying a package of Manzanilla Olives from Trader Joe’s for him as a special kibble treat. Hearing that he was ahead of me, I ate them yesterday. They were good!
I walked into Unionville just after their Memorial Day parade. Ulysses and a couple of older gentlemen he is hiking with got to bring up the rear of the parade and were roundly cheered. The volunteer fire department had free hot dogs, but the General Store was almost ready to close for the holiday, so I needed to go there. They didn’t have everything I wanted, like dried fruit and Pepperidge Farm Cookies, but I found enough. I actually bought two single serving packages of Spam, God save my soul. I also ordered the Italian Combo Sub made of Boars Head meats, a medium package of potato chips and a root beer. I ended up giving away half of the sub to passing hikers. It was too much, and there are other things I want to eat in town. The manager of the General Store joined me on the porch and told me more about Unionville. 
Unionville used to be self-sufficient with several factories. One label printing concern remains, and the town is primarily a bedroom community now.  The manager grew up here, and aside from time in the armed services, has lived right here. All of the buildings are well maintained and a sense of pride pervades the town. The flags and bunting look natural here!  When I first visited Unionville in 1998, it was an unhappy place. As a hiker and as an outsider, I was doubly not welcome. A mayor had the idea of opening up the town park for hikers to camp and even opened his own house. Word spread, and most hikers now enjoy at least a meal here. The manager walked me down to the park, pointing out the oldest house, and showed me the best place to set the tent, so it would be in the shadows when the security lights come on. The grass is soft, there’s a small pavilion or gazebo, a water faucet on the side of the town offices and a Port-a-Potty. What more does anyone need in life?  
There is one other tent pitched here. Wait, a very pale guy just came out and staggered a little. It’s Baby Bird!  That is to say, Baby Bird with the flu or some disease. Thank goodness his symptoms are nothing like my cold, or I would be feeling very guilty. I’ve offered to get him a cold drink or ice cream, but he just wants to sleep. I’ll mention him to the General Store manager tomorrow morning when I go for breakfast, so I can be sure that someone checks on Baby Bird.  
Willow is 1/2 day behind me at a hostel near High Point but plans to zero tomorrow because of “shin splints”.   We are all falling apart. When I took my socks off after setting my tent, a toe nail came off with it. This is the first of many, I fear. 
Aside from the General Store that is now closed there is a bar with wings that the store manager rates a 15 on a 1 to 10 scale. I think I’ll try half a dozen as an appetizer before heading to pizza place for dinner. Those are the three businesses in town. All gain handsomely from the hiker friendly atmosphere. According to the manager, being friendly to hikers has made Unionville more friendly to everyone and a much nicer town for all!","Rutherford Shelter
","Unionville, New York","May 28, Mon",11.70
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592285,"The wings at Wit’s End Tavern were as good as Butch, the General store manager, said. Wit’s End is very much a community bar and social center, but hikers are greeted warmly. I had the naked wings with the original sauce (like Anchor Bar in Buffalo) and blue cheese dressing with my carrot and celery sticks, along with a pleasant draft of a German style beer that started with a W.
More hikers came into Unionville before sunset, including Jelly who I had assumed was far ahead and also Tyler, christened Red Rocket by Jelly for his red hair and hiking speed, and Red’s cousin Bodie, hiking a few days with him. Red Rocket started in Port Clinton on the worst rocks of Pennsylvania, averaging 17-18 miles a day. Needless to say, his feet are swollen and resemble raw hamburger. 
Putting Red Rocket’s feet far from my mind, I enjoyed a salad and personal pizza at Annabel’s right across the street from the town park where I was tented. The personal pizza with sausage, mushrooms, onions and black olives was 12” in diameter, more than I could eat.  Jelly came along at an opportune time to scarf down the two remaining slices. I had an iced tea with it and paid the consequences of having a hard time falling asleep. 
Butch showed up and told me more of the town’s history and walked me around the park, pausing to tell me the story of each person commemorated with a brass marker. Families often donate trees to the park to honor loved ones. One lady lived to 104, but several died tragically before age 30, including one killed in the Virginia Tech Massacre. I nearly cried at some of the stories. Being out on the trail does that to me. I finally couldn’t take it anymore and escaped to my tent. My emotions are usually well controlled and measured in regular life, but on the trail, my emotions are instantly accessible. Tears, and joy, come quickly and unexpectedly. It’s like out here my illusion of being in control is stripped away. 
It was warm in my tent and I tossed and turned lying on my sleeping bag. Eventually it cooled and I dropped into sleep. City birds must awaken before rural birds, because the birds of Unionville were at full volume by 4:30. I packed up and walked over to the General Store to sit on their porch, charge my phone, and wait for them to open at six. When I went to charge my Anker 10,000 mAh external battery yesterday, I couldn’t find it’s charging cable. I must have left it in Delaware Water Gap. It was about 50% charged, good to charge my iPhone about twice. I thought I would have to post only very short entries until I visited home and replaced it.  I enjoyed a wonderful breakfast sandwich with egg, cheese and Taylor ham. People in these parts speak of Taylor ham with great fondness. From what I can determine it is a processed pork roll with various flavorings, not unlike Spam. Butch saw to it that my sandwich had about 1/2” of the fatty stuff. It was definitely filling and I didn’t crave a snack until after 9. 
With Butch’s cautions and his promise to check on Baby Bird, I was on my way about 6:30. It felt hot and muggy from the start and only became more so. After following a creek on near level trail, the trail climbed a little only to descend through pastures to Oil City Road. After crossing the Wallkill River, the trail turned onto a dike surrounding the Wallkill National Wildlife Refuge, following it about 2/3 of the way around. It is a beautiful wetlands, alive with the timpani of frogs, the constant hiss of insects, the chack and chirr of red-winged blackbirds, honking of snow geese, the mighty gronk of a great blue heron, the majestic silence of a pair of trumpeter swans, and many birds I neither recognized by sound not sight. On the dike, bunny rabbits peacefully grazed on the tender grass, not fleeing at my approach but keeping a wary eye on me and twitching in preparation for flight. A painted turtle convinced that the water on other side of the dike was preferable pulled in both feet and head, knowing that its patience would prevail. I took a photo of its shell.
After a long walk through a swamp on well-maintained puncheons, the trail ascended Pochuck Mountain and seemed like the Appalachian Trail again. I went into Pochuck Shelter for my morning snack and found Turtle seated at the picnic table, reading a James Patterson novel he had found there. His neck is hurting so he has decided on an in-the-woods zero day. I showed him a few stretches and offered him a few Aleve. Seeing Turtle reminded me that I didn’t want my hike to turn into a death march to meet an arbitrary schedule. On the spot, I decided that instead of hiking 17 miles through today’s heat and, if I stayed on my revised schedule to forego shower and laundry for a total of 10 days, I would only hike to NJ 94 and spend the night in either a B&B in nearby Warwick or the Appalachian Motel. The B&B was fully booked, but the motel had space and sounded very friendly.  
Returning to the trail, I met Hoot, who started in Georgia. He retired as an Air Force Colonel, the head of the Computer Science and Cyber Warfare Department at the Air Force Academy. He is determined to average 18 miles per day for the rest of his hike, certainly an ambitious goal for anyone in their 60’s. Our hiking speeds and styles were compatible and the conversation made the rest of the climb up Pochuck Mountain and down to the boardwalk over  they marshlands of the Pochuck River most pleasant.  The boardwalk itself is over a mile long and fully ADA compliant, a crowning tribute to Karen Lutz who is retiring as the Mid-Atlantic director for ATC. The community of Vernon first opposed the project convinced that it would bring hippies, rapists and generally disreputable hikers into their backyards. Today the town treats the boardwalk as a tourist attraction, especially for birders, and takes great pride in it. The local school is fully engaged in the Trail to Every Classroom program offered by ATC and the National Park Service. A kiosk by the parking area showcases student environmental art. On a day like this, sunscreen was definitely in order. By the first bridge, Hoot and I spent some time watching a large 24” alligator snapping turtle feed on aquatic vegetation. Birds and insects were everywhere. There’s also a really cool wooden suspension bridge that floats in the marsh and won a national design award. We soon arrived at NJ 94 and the nearby Heaven Hill Farm Store. I chugged down a mango lemonade and walked across the street to a Sabrett Hotdog food truck. The owner served up philosophy along with his hotdogs. We hit it off, earning me a free bag of potato chips and a discount on a birch beer. I returned to Heaven Hill and gobbled it down with a speed worthy of champion Joey Chestnut. Hoot and I said goodbye and he continued his hike up Wawayanda Mountain, a 700’ climb I wouldn’t want to do in this heat. I phoned the Appalachian Motel and was soon cozy in an extraordinary just-remodeled room that is near perfection, including a dark travertine walk-in shower with glass accent tiles, earning it a solid 8 on my 1 to 10 scale. Only the location, remote from anyplace, is a drawback. I mentioned my missing charging cable to the owner and as I had hoped, they had a box of cables left by previous guests. Problem solved, so I will continue to bore you with long entries. 
Red Rocket and Bodie are here as well. They plan to go only 5 miles tomorrow to encourage foot healing. The spacing of the shelters means either 5 miles or 18 tomorrow. The weather should be cooler tomorrow so I’ll aim for the 18. 
Several restaurants deliver to the motel, including a Chinese one that I hope is open. It would cap off a truly wonderful day!","Unionville, New York
",Appalachian Motel - NJ 94,"May 29, Tue",11.80
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592401,"The Chinese restaurant delivered, but it would have been better for me if they hadn’t. I ate the spring roll, some of the wonton soup, and picked through the Hunan chicken, shrimp and vegetables. It had a little red pepper by it on the menu but had neither heat nor flavor.  Dreadful!
At their request, I gave the owners of the motel a wake up call at 6:30 and picked up my clothes, all beautifully folded. I felt guilty stuffing it into my sacks.  On the way back to the trailhead, I noticed a Ganesh figure on the dashboard and commented that if I were Hindi, my favorite god would be Ganesh who is represented by an elephant. Mrs. Owner exclaimed, “Mine too!  And every kid in India loves Ganesh, because like them, he has a sweet tooth and gives sweets to children.”  
I started hiking at 7:15. The 900’ ascent of Wawayanda Mountain was beautifully laid out and designed, with lots of elegant rock work. There wasn’t a single step over 12” in height.  Then the trail was easy. I met Cody Coyote again. At one point I told him that he was one of the hikers I most admired out here, because he is a creature of the forest. He spent last night camped in woods behind the grocery store in Vernon. The woods were posted, but he is good at going invisible. Cody is borderline homeless and had lived in one of the encampments in Burlington. I wonder how it would go over with my neighbors if I had invited him for a visit. He is a gentle soul and seems quite natural in the woods. 
About a quarter mile before the NJ/NY state line, the trail starts following rocky ledges. I met Day Maker at the state line. He started another week long section hiking south from Route 17A today. I combined my lunch of honey peanut butter on a tortilla with my state line photo. The view of Greenwood Lake from Prospect Rock was great. On the New York side, for the next four miles, the trail continues to follow rock ledges. I was thankful for the traction my shoes offer and often frustrated at the poor blazing. I had to resort to my Trail app several times. It was slow going. Even after coming off the ledges, the trail was not well maintained and hard to see at times. The plants are threatening to grow over the trail. 
At Highway 17A, there was a hotdog truck, but it closed at 3:00. My late start this morning cost me dearly since it was 3:20 when I got there. I consoled myself with a stupendous vanilla milkshake at Bellvale Farms Creamery, about 0.2 miles west of the trail. They’ve won awards for their ice cream. The shake was perfectly simple with six large scoops of ice cream and a cup or so of milk, blended to perfection. I felt a little out of place among all the clean people!
The final two miles to Wildcat Shelter included two rock formations, the Eastern Pinnacles and Cat Rocks. I could have done without them!  Ulysses was at the shelter when I arrived and Red Rocket has come in. His cousin Bodie has returned home. We’ve had some really nice and honest conversations.  The privy here is truly disgusting and I hope not to use it. The water source ends up being a small tanin-rich stream about 0.2 back on the trail. I enjoyed Ramen with soy and Spam tonight. What has become of me when such a concoction tastes delicious?  Can I really be thankful for Spam?  
I texted with Willow today. She’s going to try hiking wearing compression stockings and see if that helps with the pain she is calling shin splints. At first I misunderstood and thought she was going home. Even though I haven’t seen Willow in some time, just knowing that she is out here is a source of great joy for me.","Appalachian Motel - NJ 94

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592499,"Ulysses and I were up early and left the shelter at 6, hoping to do 19 miles to William Brien Memorial Shelter. The Trail had other ideas. Even though there were no major ascents today, the total ascent was nearly 3,900’. Unless you’ve climbed that much vertically, you don’t know what that means. On good trail, it would be quite tolerable. Most of the climbs today, however, were closer to rock scrambles than hiking trail. There was a lovely waterfall, Fitzgerald Falls, but water was scarce most of the day. We refilled twice from jugs of water left by trail angels. They were saints to us. The most interesting rock formation was The Lemon Squeezer. The challenge is to get through the narrow rock slot without taking your pack off.  It’s not only narrow but also slants to one side. I managed with my small pack, but Ulysses was unable. It took us a while to find a bypass trail for him. 
We both found it a very frustrating day, and I fear, our frustration made its way into our language. Cursing prevailed. It didn’t help that it was overcast all day with just enough rain to assure that the rocks were slippery and our shoes and socks more than a little damp. We arrived at Fingerboard about 4:00. Neither of us wanted to go another five miles today. 
There were scores of pink lady slippers, orange spotted newts, toads and the occasional tree frog. I’m thankful for Ulysses’ company today and for the chance to get to know him. He started in Georgia but our hiking speeds and styles are similar.","Wildcat Shelter
",Fingerboard Shelter,"May 31, Thu",14.30
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592630,"I felt like Lewis and Clark upon seeing the Hudson River for the first time from West Mountain. Oh, the Joy!  I had planned from the beginning to return to Burlington sometime in the next few days. Seeing the Hudson and having started my hike at the Potomac made this seem like a natural place to end the first part of my hike. So today I’ll return to Burlington for a few days of rest, to celebrate Tom’s birthday, and to get my hair cut and beard trimmed. Santa’s grungy little helper is not a good look for me!
I slept late this morning, until 5:10. Ulysses is usually up before me, but he showed no sign of stirring. I didn’t expect Red Rocket to wake early. I packed up as quietly as possible, ate a breakfast bar and crept out into the fog at 5:45. I found myself confused, but with the help of Guthook quickly found the shelter trail and the AT. Almost immediately a pileated woodpecker swooped in front of me, followed a few minutes later by three turkey strutting on the forest floor. They seemed totally unconcerned by my presence.  I stopped for water at a small clear running creek about a mile from the shelter. The evidence of the iron industry was everywhere, in mining debris, charcoal rick circles and level roadbeds, perhaps for railways. 
The trail was totally different from yesterday and a pleasure to hike. Perhaps it is because I was now in Harriman State Park, but whatever the reason, I was thankful. There were still short steep ups, but there were well-constructed rock steps instead of rock scrambles.  I only had to touch rock to pull myself up twice today. What a difference!  The light rain ended about 11:00. I found a nice place for lunch on West Mountain, where I could see the Hudson for the first time. I decided on the spot that I would return home tomorrow. I booked my ticket on the Amtrak Vermonter and reserved a room at the Holiday Inn Express in Fort Montgomery. 
Coming down West Mountain, I met two volunteer maintainers relocating gear for rock work. I thanked them profusely!  We know people in common, particular Walt and Jane Daniels who had served as officers of the New York - New Jersey Trail Conference. I had served with both of them on the old ATC Board of Managers. Jane was infamous for knitting throughout every meeting. I regret that I lost Jane’s knit cap in our house fire in 2009. The volunteers were particularly proud of a rock ladder they had constructed on the ascent of Bear Mountain, made from pinned rocks.  It is elegant and a testament to their skill. 
As much as I appreciated the rock work, frankly I would have appreciated a few privies and renovated shelters more. The privies in New Jersey were state-of-the-art moldering privies and were well-maintained. There simply were none in New York. Given the heavy use the New York trails receive, this seems unconscionable to me. The impact of thousands of cat holes, even if properly dug, must be great. There was abundant evidence of surface deposition with toilet paper littering the trail at times.  I’m being polite in my phrasing, after my profanity yesterday. 
The rock work on Bear Mountain was amazing. It’s been a multi year project. This part of the Trail is intensely hiked and the trail had become badly eroded. I generally dislike hardened trail, but in this case it is necessary and has been artfully done. On the way down Bear Mountain, I hiked with Mowgli, a section hiker ending his hike that started in Caladonia State Park in Pennsylvania. We walked through the trailside zoo together. I tried not to look at the animals. They are all disabled in some way and cannot be released. Still, it makes me sad to see them caged. I do like the statue of Walt Whitman. I would have liked to have met him. 
The mile walk up NY 9W to the hotel was the worst part of the day. The sidewalk radiated heat and my feet felt on fire for the first time on this hike. I stopped at a convenience store to use their ATM - I was down to $5. There was only one desk clerk on duty at the Holiday Inn Express in Fort Montgomery.  I had to wait nearly 30 minutes to check in. I tried channeling Willow and expressed sympathy for the lone clerk’s dilemma. He upgraded me to a king suite with a whirlpool!  Thank you, Willow!  
I’m having dinner at a nearby BBQ restaurant. It’s good, but the ribs are not up to Southern “long and slow” standards. The double IPA from Michigan, however, is hoppy enough to be from Vermont. I’ve arranged for a taxi tomorrow morning to take me to Peekskill where I will catch the commuter train into New York City. The weather tomorrow looks good, so I will enjoy the walk to Penn Station from Grand Central Station.  Now it’s back to the hotel and a long soak in the whirlpool!  Really an excellent day. 
When I get home, I’ll reevaluate my gear. My shoes need replacing again, and also my Superfeet insoles that are a couple of years old. We will see what other changes I make!
What a lovely day this has been!  Such a contrast to yesterday. I wish I had the spiritual maturity to see each day as a gift. Perhaps one day. Meanwhile there will be days of praise like today and days of cursing like yesterday.","Fingerboard Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592809,"Do you get the feeling that my thru-hike is a soap opera, and not a well-written one at that?  Characters appear and disappear with regularity, and the plot has a plethora of unresolved cliffhangers.  Will Willow and Sugarfoot ever get to hike together again?  Did Rocky Raccoon’s black eyes heal?  Whatever happened to Baby Bird, who we left in his tent sick as a dog back in Unionville, New York?
Baby Bird, who first starred as Sam, took a few zero days in Uniontown, but continued to feel sick.  He went to an urgent care clinic that diagnosed either Anaplasmosis or Babesiosis, both diseases borne by our friend, the black-legged tick.  The hospital confirmed the diagnosis and initiated treatment.  Baby Bird is now back in Houston recovering, his thru-hike over.  He hopes to hike a Southern section later this year.  No one was more assiduous about wearing Permethrin-treated clothing or in doing daily tick inspections than Baby Bird.  
Rocky Raccoon’s eyes have healed, but there’s still a bump on her nose that she’s regarding as  a badge of honor.  She’s found friends who backpack and will be in the market for a pack that actually fits her and lighter gear.  
I’m hoping that during my week off the trail, Willow will catch up and pass where I stopped at Bear Mountain.  That will give me strong incentive to catch her!  
The trip home yesterday was uneventful.  The taxi came on time, I figured out how to use the MTA ticket machine, and enjoyed a pleasant walk from Grand Central Terminal to Penn Station, paying homage to Gertrude Stein along the way.  The Amtrak Vermonter left on time, but arrived in Essex Junction one hour and 20 minutes late.  A tree had fallen across the tracks.  Will I ever be free of blowdowns?  It was 10:30 when we arrived home, quite past my trail bedtime.
When I came out of the bedroom this morning, I was blown away by the view from our condo.  When I left in late April, the trees were bare.  Now they are in full summer foliage.  Looking over the city to Lake Champlain and the Adirondacks beyond is better than any view I’ve had on my hike thus far.  Don’t worry, however, I’m not clicking my ruby heels together and incanting, “There’s no place like home; no place like home …”  I have a return ticket to New York City on the Ethan Allen Express from Rutland on Friday and will start hiking again on Saturday morning.  I wonder if I can cadge a whirlpool upgrade again at the Holiday Inn Express in Fort Montgomery?  Maybe if Randall is on duty!
I’m making a list of things that I need to accomplish this week, including finding new lighter weight Permethrin-treated clothing or treating my own.  I brought treated clothing by Ex-Officio, but I found them much to hot to wear and they only served as pack ballast.  The treated Buff, on the other hand, was not only a superior sweatband but kept most of the tiny gnats away from my face.  I haven’t worn my bug net hat yet, but I’ll continue to carry it.  I look forward to washing my sleeping bag and puffy — they reek!  
I weighed myself this morning and have lost 17 pounds in five weeks.  I knew this would be a problem for me, but I must find a solution.  I’m going to try going stoveless for the next month.  I have come to loathe Knorr Sides, Ramen, and instant mashed potatoes.  Also tortillas.  I’m going to carry bagels, pita, crackers, summer sausage, instant hummus and tabouli, and lots more cheese.  I’ll keep a jar of peanut butter in an external pocket on my backpack, so I can scarf down a heaping tablespoon every time I stop.  I’ll also start carrying Snickers and other calorie dense snacks.
I’ve been told that the power tool section of Big Box home improvement stores have better ear plugs than the moldable silicone ones I’ve been using.  It’s worth a try.  My second pair of shoes probably have a hundred miles left on them, but I might as well replace them now.  My green Superfeet insoles are a couple of years old and are showing bad wear.  I’m sure I’ll find other things when I open my pack and start cleaning my gear.  Assuming that I’m not rendered unconscious by the hiker stench, I’ll evaluate all of my gear and let you know what worked well and what hasn’t.  If you’ve ever been tempted to believe that you are closer to an angel than to beast, go on a long backpacking trip and your true nature will be revealed in all of its fetor.  
I look forward to going to church this morning, and scaring the little children with my Grizzly Adams beard.  I do hope that Miss Jackie is there.  She will be scandalized.","Burlington, VT

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593309,"I have really enjoyed being home, sleeping in my own bed, and being with my husband.  We’ve been together long enough — 41 years — that we don’t pine away when we are apart, but still, it’s nice being together.  Besides, today is his birthday!  I wanted to be home for that.  Church was great on Sunday.  I was greeted like the prodigal son, especially by members of the choir, and the recessional hymn (#530 in the Episcopal Hymnal) was one I know as the peanut butter hymn, starting, “Spread, O spread, thou mighty word …,” a reminder that I need to eat more of it.  And ice cream was served after the service.  When asked which flavor I wanted, I resisted answering, “Yes.”
I’ve gone through all of my gear.  When I return to New York tomorrow, my pack will weigh about 2-1/2 pounds less.  That’s not even counting the weight of the dirt removed by washing everything!  The major savings are going stoveless (nearly 1 pound including the fuel canister) and leaving the Ex-Officio Bugsaway clothing (1-1/2 pounds) at home.   It was simply too hot to wear, in spite of the superior tick protection it offered.  I’ve treated my other clothing, backpack and tent with pyrethrin.  I’ve also switched to a picaridin-based insect repellent from DEET, based on the recommendation of Doc Holiday, a hiker I met who recently retired as a primary care doctor with the Veterans Administration.  He says it is far more effective against the black-legged tick.  I can’t find support for that assertion on-line, but everything else that I’ve read indicates that picaridin is at least as effective as DEET against insects in general.  So why not try it? 
There are other minor weight savings, like leaving the AT DataBook (3.7 ounces) at home — I never used it — but they are offset by weight gains, like adding a second pocket to the back of my pack for keeping peanut butter and Fritos accessible during the day.  Ten Fritos Scoop chips and one level tablespoon of peanut butter is a quick 250 calories!  I’m also packing more snacks and even Snickers.  Instead of depending on Knorr’s noodles and rice sides for calories, I’ll rehydrate tabouli during the day and use it as a base for salmon or tuna.  Instead of tortillas, I’m planning to buy real New York bagels when I get to Grand Central Station tomorrow!  I’ll also prepare a daily snack baggie to keep in one of my hip belt pockets.  Eating everything in it, plus three or four servings of Fritos and peanut butter, ought to increase my calorie intake by about 1,500 per day, and at least slow my weight loss.  I’ll reevaluate my food again when I return home in late June for a dental cleaning and to switch out my summer sleeping bag for a 20-degree bag before hiking New Hampshire and Maine.  
Being home and resting for a few days has also healed me of the vestiges of the cold I picked up in Pennsylvania.  I’m still having some tree pollen allergies, but they are easily dealt with, and the tree pollen season is nearly over.   My third pair of shoes is broken in.  My legs and feet feel good, so I’m ready for some new pains.  We’ll have to wake up early tomorrow.  It’s about a two-hour drive to Rutland for the Amtrak Ethan Allen Express that leaves at 7:46AM.  If it arrives at Grand Central Station on time, I should be back at the Holiday Inn in Ft. Montgomery about 3:30, but it could be much later.  I really enjoy taking the train but it’s essential to view the published schedule as only a suggestion and not to get upset at the almost inevitable delays.  The MTA Hudson Line runs until the wee hours and Academy Taxi was very responsive on the trip home, so why worry?
I’m thankful for the time I’ve had at home and looking forward to meeting new friends on the Trail, and possibly catching up to old ones.  It’s all good!","Burlington, VT

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593519,"Note to self:  Say three times:  This is not a death march!  
Yesterday went swimmingly. We had a pleasant drive to Rutland. The Amtrak Ethan Allen Express left on time and arrived at Grand Central Station only 45 minutes late. Finding bagels and the MTA ticket machine left me confused and stressed. Stops on the Hudson Line were announced, but I couldn’t understand the station names. Once I found an online list of stations I relaxed. Garrison is right after Peekskill.  Even with a very talkative seatmate, I enjoyed the ride. The taxi pulled up 45 seconds after the train, and I was checked into the Holiday Inn at Ft Montgomery by 4:30. I’ve returned to Barnstormer BBQ for an early dinner, avoiding the ribs this time. I’m trying the blackened catfish tonight and that delicious Michigan double IPA is still on draft.  Ahh.  One big gulp and I’m feeling much better now.  Kudos to Barnstormer for managing to blacken the fish without overcooking it!  Happy tummy!  I was up by 3:30 this morning, so I’m planning to be in bed early tonight.  
Willow is one day ahead of me. River is two days behind. The weather forecast looks good, although it keeps changing. The first chance of showers is not until Wednesday, and that’s only a 50% chance. 
Surprise!  I was sound asleep at 7:15 last night when my phone rang. It was River!  She had Ubered in to the motel, and Puddles was staying in the motel just south of here. I had met River and Puddles at the Flip Flop Festival and haven’t seen them since. They had delayed their start from Harpers Ferry by two days. After they showered, we went back to Barnstormer. I just had a half order of wings and another beer, while they consumed full meals. We shared stories and complaints, along with aches and pains, just like regular people. Puddles will be taking a zero tomorrow and River will slack pack the section to the Palisades Parkway, so that she and Puddles will be at the same point and can start there tomorrow. I will continue north today across the Hudson.  They both shared my frustration at the New York trail west of the Hudson and are both still reeling from the Pennsylvania trail. It made me very thankful for the past week of rest and recovery. I hope to see River and Puddles again, and the Trail has a way of making that happen. It’s very odd. Sometimes I get the feeling that this hike, and indeed life itself, is all about friends and food. What we do in between like hiking or working is incidental. I guess that is why I’m so surprised by Anthony Bourdain’s suicide. He had mastered friends and food. 
I went down to breakfast when they opened at 6:00, checked out and walked the 0.9 miles to the Bear Mountain Bridge, starting across at 7:15. I liked this bridge much more than the one at Delaware Water Gap. The Bear Mountain bridge doesn’t  bounce up and down with passing traffic. Then came a big 700’ up to say, “Welcome back, Sugarfoot!”  It wasn’t a bad climb at all, with no rock scrambles, but the week away made it seem bad. I wasn’t huffing and puffing, but it definitely took a lot of effort. It didn’t help to have a herd of trail runners gazelle past me on the steepest section. The only animals today were chipmunks, in abundance, and a black swallowtail-type butterfly with blue markings.  The mountain laurels bloomed in my absence. The trail volunteers have been very busy here with their chainsaws, and without their efforts I don’t think the trail would have been passable. Lots of trees fell during last week’s storms that I fortunately missed.  The weather today was mild, staying in the 70’s and mostly sunny. 
I met a NOBO thru-hiker from Cleveland named Swish. I must have arched my eyebrows because he carefully explained that it is a basketball term and mentioned his GIRLfriend about a dozen times. Whatever. He is a youngster of 52 and much faster, but I met him again at the Appalachian Market that is right on the trail. I got there about 10 and had an early lunch of a grilled cheese with bacon and a Dr Pepper. Swish had second breakfast instead, an enormous platter of two of everything breakfast related. Another NOBO named Captain Black was also there, wolfing down an enormous double hamburger and onion rings. I just wasn’t all that hungry. Captain Black had had to take several weeks off for a wrist problem at Delaware Water Gap. Swish left before I did, but I kept expecting the good captain to pass me. He didn’t. I also met a local day hiker named In the Way and a Brooklynite named Ryan taking his 7 or 8 year old son Henry on his first overnight hike. Henry was shy but kept a refrain going of “Daddy, are we there yet?”  I moved ahead to escape. 
I intended to tent at one of the group tent sites at Dennytown Road, but being a weekend the sites were all reserved by Boy Scouts. I wasn’t allowed to camp at their sites since I haven’t been vetted by Boy Scouts and approved. I don’t think of myself as a threat to anyone, but I moved on and found a perfect shady tentsite about 1/10th of a mile north of the road. I walked back for the potable water and to bandana bathe. 
It was a good first day back, except for some reason my knees hurt today for the first time. I’ll take some Aleve tonight and stretch out my quads. If they still hurt tomorrow, I’ll take it easy and not do the 19+ miles I had planned.","US 9W, Bear Mountain Circle

At first I thought that my right knee was fine and that only my left hurt, but it didn’t take very long to figure out that it was just that the worse pain on the left was covering the pain on the right. Level trail wasn’t bad, maybe a 3 on the 0 - 10 pain scale. Uphills were about a 6. Downhills were a 7 with spikes of 8. The trail itself was good today, with long sections following nearly level mining paths. Absent the knee problem, I would have been at the RPH Shelter before 10 and easily could have gone the 19 I had wanted to. With the knees, it took me 7 hours. Both knees are swollen, making them slow to move. I felt very insecure on rock. 
This problem with my knees isn’t new. Osteoarthritis was first diagnosed 25 years ago and the dreaded prognosis pronounced, “progressive and degenerative.”  It’s called degenerative joint disease now, but it amounts to the same thing. It has caused me to curtail several hikes, including a thru-hike attempt in 2013. I almost got total knee replacements then, and again two years ago. But the last doctor sent me to physical therapy first. It worked, and I really thought I would be able to complete this thru-hike. My knees survived Pennsylvania with nary a whimper. Why now on this relatively gentle terrain are they causing me such pain?  
I wish I had an answer. My knees respond to neither logic nor prayer. St. Roch (San Rocco) is the patron saint of knees, by the way. Actually he was renowned against plague, but in iconography he is often pictured with a dog licking one of his knees, so he has been awarded patronage of dogs and knees as well.  It’s obviously only a sideline with him, or perhaps I am not sufficiently devout. 
RPH Shelter is located in a suburban neighborhood. Amenities include a garbage can and porch furniture including two chaises.  Apparently bears are not a worry. The shelter itself is like a garage with bunks and two picnic tables outside. Water is from a pump. 
From years of living with my knees, I know that they won’t get better overnight or in two or three days. It takes weeks or months after an episode like this one. So absent an overnight miracle, I’ll make arrangements to return home. That’s a positive thing. Going off trail sounds so dismal. I am sorry to disappoint those who have been following me. 
Some lovely people are staying here tonight. Robbie from San Francisco and I shared a large veggie pizza, delivered right to the shelter.  A mother and daughter from Wayne, PA are also here at the end of their first day of a hike that will end on Katahdin. And seven members of The Hoard, an advance guard of the NOBO bubble are here as well. A couple who live nearby came by with two coolers of drinks and boxes of peanut M&Ms and Oreo Cookies. Magic makes for a nice ending.","Stealth Tentsite at 1419.3

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593705,"The Hoard was noisy, boisterous, full of vim and vigor — everything you would want a group of young men to be — unless you were trying to sleep. But sleep I did, only awakening occasionally to turn over, an action that caused me pain. There was no nocturnal miracle. I debated whether to call Uber to the shelter. If pizza could be delivered there, certainly Uber could find it. I dithered and decided to hike the five miles, to give me time to say goodbye to the Trail I know how corny that sounds. In my dreams last night, I reconciled myself to leaving, but I still want a last quiet time in the woods. 
The trail today was truly excellent. The volunteer trail maintainer Ralph for whom the Ralph’s Peak Hiker Cabin is named has hiked over 4,000 miles on the AT and takes his section very seriously. Except for a few stretches that were extensively damaged and chainsawed last week, the trail was immaculate. There were even switchbacks not needed for erosion control but just to make the walk nicer for hikers. Look at the picture!  Ralph has even removed rock from the treadway and stacked it neatly at the edges.  The five miles to NY 52 should have taken no more than two hours to hike, but it took me four hours. Bending and straightening my left knee hurt with each step.  Deer, squirrels, chipmunks and even a turkey came out to say goodbye. And a pink lady slipper made a cameo appearance. 
I got to NY 52 and walked down to the Mountaintop Market planning to call a taxi to take me to Pawling, the nearest town with a MTA train into “The City” tomorrow morning. I reserved a room at the Station Inn there. No cab company was interested in coming for me. Before my hike, I downloaded the Uber app, so I tried it. My first time, and it worked great. You probably use Uber and Lyft all the time. It was a revelation to me. 
The Station Inn is just a few minutes walk from the train station and directly across from “downtown” Pawling. The Inn has four small rooms with in suite baths but minimal services. I obtained my key from a lockbox on the front porch using a security code they provided when I made my reservation. The Inn opened just last year and the rooms are very modern in furniture and fixtures, a style that makes the small spaces seem larger. After showering with the usual after-hiking multiple shampoos and soapings, I gathered my clothes and walked across the street to the Clothery, a laundromat by any other name. None of the local businesses would change a twenty, so now I have lots of quarters. I felt myself getting faint by the time my clothes were done, so I walked down a few doors to a Chinese takeaway. I ate in, and it was excellent. I asked for the Szechuan chicken to be extra spicey.  It wasn’t, but there was at least a little heat. The veggies were still crisp and the chicken tender. Never trust a hiker, or a former hiker, for a restaurant review. I would have raved about dog food, but it seemed good to me. I stopped at the Station and bought my ticket for tomorrow. Then I returned to my room.  I would like to walk around and explore Pawling, but my knees don’t want to go out and play. It would be no fun without them, so I’m half-watching Netflix and eating double chocolate Milano’s from my leftover food. I’ll walk over to the Tavern later for dinner. 
I’ll post a final entry in a few days.  Perhaps I can convince myself that having hiked 400 miles on the Appalachian Trail is a good thing, even though I set out to hike 2,191 miles. Perhaps I can convince myself that I was out long enough to learn all the lessons that the Trail had to teach me. No, on that one too.  It takes a writer as talented as Bill Bryson to pull that one off. I’ll try to think of something more profound than failure. I know I didn’t have any choice than to go off trail, but that isn’t much comfort right now.  I wonder if the Tavern is open yet?  A  draught from the River Lethe seems in order. Skol!","RPH Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594293,"The Amtrak Vermonter actually arrived in Essex Junction near Burlington on-time Tuesday evening.  Perhaps that was an omen.   I do believe in omens and portents; I just wish I knew what they mean.  I met with a nurse practitioner at the University of Vermont Medical Center yesterday morning.  Her job was to triage my condition and make referrals, and that she did.  I am to take high doses of naproxen (Aleve) for the next five to seven days.  Without the Aleve, my pain level was pretty high.  With it, I can function and sleep.  The first opening at UVM Orthopedics is in about a month, but I started physical therapy this morning. 
As far as pain goes, this was my most severe episode of patella-femoral pain.  I was told from the first diagnosis of osteoarthritis in 1997 that episodes would increase in frequency and severity.  The new name of degenerative joint disease for osteoarthritis is quite descriptive.  It doesn’t get better.  The goals of treatment are management of pain and inflammation.  As is usually the case with diseases that have no cure, DJD attracts scads of proprietary remedies and well-intended treatment protocols largely based on wishful thinking and anecdotal reports.  Dare I say financially motivated quackery?  Treatment recommendations with a strong evidence base are harder to find.  
The 2nd Edition of Treatment of Osteoarthritis of the Knee, Evidence-Based Guidelines, adopted by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons in 2013 offers a good summary:  https://www.aaos.org/cc_files/aaosorg/research/guidelines/treatmentofosteoarthritisofthekneeguideline.pdf.  Recommendations with moderate to strong evidence include strengthening, low-impact aerobic exercise and physical activity, weight loss, and the use of non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.  There are moderate to strong recommendations against acupuncture, lateral wedge insoles, glucosamine and chondroitin, hyaluronic acid injections, needle lavage, and arthroscopy with lavage and/or debridement.  The jury is still out on the really cool treatment alternatives like PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma) and stem cells.  The American College of Rheumatology has issued similar guidelines.  When the recommended nonsurgical treatments are insufficient, then joint replacements should be considered.
Over the years, I have tried various compounds of glucosamine and chondroitin, proteolytic enzymes, various straps and braces including full off-loading braces, cortisone injections, and arthroscopic bilateral release of the patellae.  The latter procedure performed in 2010 gave me three really good years, culminating in my failed thru-hike attempt in 2013.  None of the others have been even temporarily effective.  I haven’t tried the injection of hyaluronic acid, but there is so little evidence of its effectiveness for the patella-femoral knee compartment that it isn’t even covered by insurance.  
I nearly had bilateral total knee replacements in 2013.  We had gotten as far as selecting the joint and discussing my preference for anesthesia (femoral blocks with light sedation), but the surgeon was scheduled to attend an international conference first.  He came back convinced that stem cell treatment would be the standard protocol within five years and that he would be viewed as a barbarian for having done joint replacement surgery.  Guess what?  A standard stem cell protocol remains five years away, and there are real doubts about the quality of the regenerated cartilage.  I am tempted to return to Sarasota for a reevaluation and to proceed with the total knee replacements.
Things move slower up here in Burlington.  Perhaps that’s a good thing.  The orthopedic surgeons affiliated with the UVM Medical Center don’t have a direct financial stake in each replacement surgery.  Physical therapy went well this morning, and I’ve scheduled three weekly appointments.  Today was mostly an evaluation, but they gave me a couple of exercises to add to the ones I’m already doing.  I’ll start the PT exercises, stretching and foam rolling tomorrow and return to the Y on Monday.  They have little doubt that the current arthritic flare will subside and that I can get myself back to where I was before this episode, able to do virtually anything except deep knee bends or squats without pain.   They encouraged me to avoid activities that cause pain. Unfortunately, those are the activities that I want to do.  I’ve tried long-distance cycling and don’t enjoy it, and find that any intensity causes the same knee pain that I’m experiencing now.  I loathe swimming.
I anticipate that in a couple of months I’ll find myself in a quandary.  Do I limit my activities to the equivalent of sitting and rocking, what some would term acting my age, and gradually descend into senescence, or do I risk total knee replacements now, while I’m in peak physical condition?  The latest joint replacements have a thirty-year life expectancy.  Will the UVM surgeons even the consider replacement if I’m capable of the activities of daily living? 
Obviously, I’m unhappy not to have completed my thru-hike.  Obviously, I’m frustrated with the way things have ended.  Could I have recognized the onset of the arthritic flare episode and gotten off the trail for a few days for it to have subsided?  Possibly, but I don’t know how to distinguish between early arthritic pain and the usual pains that accompany all backpacking.  Why, after surviving the foot- and knee-destroying terrain of Pennsylvania and the New York trail west of the Hudson River, did my knees suddenly act up on comparatively gentle terrain? Is this God’s way of laughing at me?  Or is it simply that stuff happens?  Fate or chance?
So that’s how I’ll end this journal, with a great big question mark.  Thanks to all of you who have followed me, and especially to those who signed my guest book!  Your encouragement and your book recommendations really meant a lot to me along the way.  If I find any answers or decide on new knees, I’ll let you know.",,View Entry,"Jun 15, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598211,"It’s been six weeks since I returned from the Trail in failure, defeated by my knees once again.  There was no physical therapy miracle this time, probably because I had already incorporated the physical therapy exercises I was taught two years ago into my daily warmup routine.  The physical therapist and I both agreed to end the sessions after three meetings.  The sharp pain has pretty much receded, leaving me with aching and occasionally burning pain in both knees.  I love the terms that orthopedic surgeons use to describe pain.  Aching, burning, sharp and so forth.  It is like a wine tasting without the buzz.  How is your pain today?  Fruit forward with lots of blackberry, a hint of lingonberry, and lingering tobacco and asphalt.  I describe the pain as Muzak, a constant irritant, with occasional clashing cymbals if I go down stairs or stand up from a chair.  I can ignore the Muzak unless I wake up at night, and then it’s like a repetitive Little Drummer Boy, pa rum pum pum pum, playing in my knees.  
I’ve returned to my daily home exercises (physical therapy, dynamic stretching and foam rolling) and walking down to the Y five or six times a week.  That half-mile walk is not pleasant,  and I feel like I’m walking in slow motion, with a greatly reduced stride length and cadence.  As is usual for me during a hike, both my upper body and legs lost muscle strength, confirming that I started the hike with greater strength than I needed, always my goal.  My range of motion and flexibility is unchanged.  Needless to say, I’ve had to limit the leg exercises.  On the advice of the physical therapist, I exercise to the point of just being just shy of pain.  Sometimes that means no leg presses or leg extensions at all.   There have been days when I couldn’t even walk the half-mile and have just stayed home.  This week is much better.  My upper body strength is just about recovered and I’m able to do my circuit routine, reducing weight on the leg stations and speed on the elliptical trainer.  My knees are not close to being hikeable yet and my walking around town is greatly limited.  It is starting to drive me a little crazy.
Last week, I was finally seen by the orthopedic department at the University of Vermont Medical Center.  After x-rays, I met with a nurse practitioner who saw little evidence of cartilage damage and didn’t feel that knee replacements were indicated.  I asked what my options were, and after going through the standard list of weight reduction (I’m not overweight), physical therapy (done that), braces (check), cortisone injections (ineffective for me), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (as needed),  strengthening (not an issue), and low-impact exercise, she was left with the suggestion that I moderate my activity.  In other words, I should act my age (67), give up hiking, and take up competitive rocking.  I was not pleased and only after I insisted did she refer me to a surgeon for a consultation.  The first available appointment is two months out.  I stopped at the liquor store on the way home.  Remember the gin-soaked golden raisins craze several years ago for the relief of arthritic pain?  It works even better without the fruit. The radiologist’s report I’ve since received shows moderate arthritis in the patella femoral compartment and lesser degeneration in the lateral and medial compartments.  Surprise, surprise!   It’s not all in my head.  I need new knees, not a new head.
The day after the UVM visit, I filled out a “contact me” card on the website of Mansfield Orthopaedics, affiliated with Copley Hospital in Morristown, about an hour’s drive away.  They have a great reputation locally.  They phoned me Wednesday afternoon, took a complete history, emailed me a consent to release medical information form, and have me scheduled with a surgeon at the end of August.  The woman I spoke with understood my objectives and matched me up with a surgeon who is a hiker.  UVM uses the Smith & Nephew knee replacement system, which is a fine off-the-shelf joint and the one I had selected five years ago.  Mansfield uses the ConforMIS approach that uses imaging scans to create custom implants to resurface joint surfaces as necessary and also to correct alignment problems.  Their results have been impressive, with significantly faster recovery, greater bone preservation and less trauma.  Most of their knee replacements are done on an out-patient basis.  We will see how the consultation goes, but for the moment I am greatly encouraged and feeling much better about life!  My hope is new knees by Christmas, a test hike next summer,, and if all goes well, another Appalachian Trail Thru-Hike attempt in 2020.  I am not ready to sit and rock just yet.  
It hasn’t been all pain and misery since returning.  Being with husband Tom again is a true joy.  And I had the pleasure of hosting Willow for several days over the Independence Day holiday.  I met her at the trailhead at Manchester Center, Vermont, about 2-1/2 hours away.  She left much cleaner, a few pounds heavier from good food and drink, and with a pack several pounds lighter.  I might not be able to complete my thru-hike, but I take great comfort that some of my gear will.  My Zpacks Arc Blast pack fits Willow perfectly and she will enjoy the Zpacks Solplex tent!  
I’ve given some thought to how I will approach my 2020 thru-hike, assuming successful knee replacements.  Yes, it is silly to plan such a venture at this stage, but it makes me feel better if I visualize a hike.  That’s how I got through 30 years of tax seasons before retirement.  I will do the hike as a flip-flop again, but this time I will start 167 miles south at Rockfish Gap, the southern end of Shenandoah National Park, so that my feet are fully calloused before I get to the nasty Pennsylvania rocks.  I will try to time my arrival in Harpers Ferry to coincide with the Flip-Flop Festival.  I enjoyed that this year.  I hope my cousin Rocky Raccoon can join me once again for at least the start.  I won’t make many changes to my gear, except that I will start stoveless.  I will substitute Mountain Laurel Design’s H2O Sleeve Pack for my Zpacks Multipack to hold my in-camp items.  It weighs 0.8 ounces and also works as a daypack for travel and towns and should fit nicely along side my bear canister in the top of my pack.  Willow uses one.  We learn from each other.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617951,"On February 15, 2019, I received my first knee replacement at Copley Hospital in Morrisville, Vermont.  Everything went well and I was released in a semi-drugged stupor the next morning.  Everyone I encountered was unfailingly polite and friendly, and even the food was good.  The breakfast omelet was noteworthy!  The next two weeks was intense physical therapy including the use of a Continuous Passive Motion Machine for hours a day, a device sometimes called the Iron Maiden.  It is exquisite torture, but as a result, I had full range of motion after two weeks.  Even with morphine, it was a most unpleasant experience.  I kept three ice packs in the freezer for use in rotation.  Weeks three through six were even worse in some respects. If I didn’t move, the knee didn’t hurt.  With a mountain of pillows, I was able to find a comfortable position at night, but invariably I would move in my sleep and wake up to a sharp pain.  The association of sleep with pain leads to insomnia, the most common complaint at this stage of recovery.  Sedating anti-histamines like Benadryl were recommended, but these drugs make me hyper!  I had in-home physical therapy twice weekly for three weeks and then started out-patient.  That’s when I began to make rapid progress.  I used a walker the first two weeks, a cane the third week, and then I was able to hobble around unaided.  I returned to the Y when I was able to limp the 1/2 mile down the hill, after about six weeks.  Recovering leg strength and the ability to go up and down stairs without pain has come slowly.  I’m now at 4-1/2 months and I’m at my presurgical strength and almost back to pre-hike strength.  My walking distance is now limited by my “old” knee.  It starts to complain after about three miles.  I still have occasional swelling in my new knee, but I’m past the time when icing several times a day is a necessity.  I am still using a roller massage stick, especially on the lower quadriceps that were brutalized during the surgery.  The surgical term sounds much more gentle, but it amounts to ripping the muscle with the grain instead of cutting across it.  I’m still seeing improvement from week to week.  I met with the surgeon yesterday and we agreed to do my second knee in early October.  According to everyone and everything that I’ve read, my rehabilitation has proceeded swimmingly and I’m well ahead of schedule.  Nonetheless, I somehow expected that I would be back to 100% by now.  The pain, swelling, and discomfort was for other people, not for me.  Ah, magical thinking!  The surgeon reiterated yesterday that I will continue to see improvement for the next nine to twelve months.  He asked me the critical question, “Are you glad you had it done?”  I could answer with an unequivocal yes.  
I had hoped to make another attempt to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail starting in April 2020.  My right knee will be 14 months old then and my left knee will be six months old.  More magical thinking and not this reality.   My current fantasy, and the one I’ll carry with me into the second knee replacement, is to start in Harpers Ferry in mid-August 2020, hiking south to Springer.  October is lovely time in the Smokies!  Then in April 2021, I’ll return to Harpers Ferry and hike northward to Katahdin, completing my hike before mid-August, complying with Appalachian Trail Conservancy’s definition of thru-hiking, “hiking the entire A.T. in 12 months or less,” and earning the sobriquet of thru-hiker.  Finally.",,View Entry,"Jul 03, Wed",0
