Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588243,"Today started off going 10 mile dirt road. Raining and foggy the road was rough and getting hard to traverse in dad's dually  truck. The GPS  said we were there! But there was just a trail crossing in the road with no trail head. Another truck came but gave us directions to  the parking lot farther down the road. Reaching  trail head for the Benton Mackaye trail, I got my pack and started up the trail to joining with the AT. The rain was falling and the wind blowing. About a mile up to Springer  I came to a trail sign saying Benton Mackaye trail to the left AT forward and backs. With the wind blowing and rain falling the confusion sets in. What trail was I on. After asking other hikers  with no help I find the Springer Mtn  shelter. The rain was falling harder and the winds blowing 40 MPH it was time to stop and take stock of my situation.
    At the shelter I meet Carl and Sara and Megan.  After gathering information I was on the AT hiking south.  This was not far off the plan (which was to hike the BMT trail to the AT hike south to the Summit then head north). With 40 MHP driving rain I hit the trail again.  Top of Springer  then north bound. 
At Stover creek  I meet up with Carl again. Set up in the shelter. In spite all the has gone wrong I am now where I am suppose to be and when. 
After a dinner of what turned into bean and chicken burrito soup, which was quite good, to was off to bed. At 6:30!
Woke up two hours later my brand new pillow and sleeping pad was gone flat. Not good!","Springer mtn

Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588315,"So what happens when you get settle down for the night at 6:30; you wake up at 12:30 a.m.  With re-inflating my sleeping pad every couple of hours  the next 7 hours passed slowly.  In the morning i went to filter water and found my filter was clogged. I had chosen to leave the back flush plunger at home. A guy at the shelter said something about a ""Smart"" water bottle that I could use to back flush it.
7:30 a.m. got up packed eat powered eggs and instant grits ( not as good as i hoped) 
8:30 hit the trail. Still raining nothing to do but power through some mileage. Carl caught up to me. We hiked and talked for a little while. As the trial go stepper my pace slowed he pulled away. I wished him good luck and was left to hike alone at my own pace once again
12 miles later I arrived at the Gooch mtn Shelter. The shelter was pretty full but as it was still raining, room was made.  I squeezed in between an older man and a girl named Charlotte. The mice were bad in this shelter. Between the  mice running over on my head, my shelter mates freaking out over them, and a flat sleeping pad sleep did not come easy. The rain continues.","Stover Creek
",Gooch Mtn Shelter,"Apr 23, Mon",12.50
Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588989,"After another early to bed, late to, rise mice filled night it was time to get moving. The mice in the Gooch Shelter seemed more concerned with a dry place to eat acorns that steeling food during the night. Everybody had to empty acorns shells out of their pack and or shoes. 
Today is the my long day about 16 miles and I have to reach my destination before 5:00 PM. After 5  I cannot get a place in the hostel, can't get replacement gear and cant get my resupply box until the next day. 
Being thoroughly warned about how hard the assent up Blood Mountain will be, I decided I needed to leave early and push to get the base of Blood Mt. around 2 o'clock  giving me plenty of time for the climb. 
After clearing the acorns out and got packed I was off  (7:30 am). A trail breakfast this morning ( Pro-bar while walking).  The rain was light at this time but would become worse. Approaching Woody gap a guy from last shelter passes me. I don't remember his name, but he was definitely one of the few younger experienced hikers on the trail. He reached Woody gap first. We took shelter from the rain under a roofed kiosk. Looking at the map I had made great time and and gone over 3 miles with in the hour. We debated taking a shuttle into Suches, GA. I opted not to as I was here to hike the trail. After unloading some trash, in a trash can, it was back to the trail. I assume the other guy took the shuttle, I never saw him again. 
Another trail lunch, (another Pro-bar)
At this point my feet have wet for days and have wrinkled horribly.  My feet have got so bad now that the wrinkles are now rubbing together and causing blisters  and hot spots. Time for some foot love. After some mole skin and a fresh pair of socks it's off again.  
Another gear failure! The bag of my Sawyer squeeze blew out. This is  my fault. Since I failed to back flush the filter before I left and chose not to bring the back flush syringe i had to put extra pressure on the bag and it blew out.   One more thing to buy a the hostel that I already own at home. 
Pushing on. I met a guy named Dalton. He talked about the Freemen trail that goes around Blood Mtn. Not knowing anything about this trail we parted ways. Still pushing to get to Blood Mtn.  Being warned how difficult Blood Mt was going to be it came as a surprise when I realized i was 2/3 up it already. Still 1/3 left to climb I could relax some now. I had plenty of time to make it to Mountain Crossing.   I'm staring to think the perception  of the difficulty of the AT is based on people  with less experience. 
Coming down off Blood I meet up with Dalton again. He took the Freemen trail. Turns out its not faster and not much easier. We hiked together until Mountain Crossing. 
Made it to the hostel.  This was GOOD. As wet as my feet were and as FUBARed  my gear was I was afraid  I was not going to be able to continue if I didn't get a break.
A Dr Pepper, snickers bar, two to the worst( but oh so good) microwaveable cheese stake sandwiches and two bare feet later I'm feeling better.
The hostel was a old CCC building with a bunk room. Their is a tree with boots hung all over the branches and the AT goes under through the breeze way to continue up the next mountain. Not sure about this tree. It seem tacky and disrespectful. 
Back to the gear shop. A sleeping pad, a new water filter  and near $100 later  My gear problems might be over.
Lot of interesting people in the hostel. Met a guy named Mike who leads mission trips to Africa to fix wells and climb Mt. Kilimanjaro.  Took a picture of his card to keep for later. Also, in the hostel was Dalton, Sarah, Megan,  and a younger extremely skinny guy.
Time to dry out the boots and socks. A old VHS movie later its time for bed.","Gooch Mtn Shelter
",Mtn crossing Hostel,"Apr 24, Tue",16
Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588997,"A good night sleep and dry boots its time for a fresh start. Was able to recharge the batteries, mine and the phone's. 
Up to the store for breakfast.  Was about to grab a soda but I opted for a ""Smart Water"". Lets see what this Smartwater bottle phenomenon is about.
Perhaps it was the better weather, being dry or well rested but my outlook has changed some, I think.  The tree with the boots I found out is called the ""Tree of Soles"".  Through hikers that give up toss there boots over a branch. This started to look less tacky and started to make me think of the prayer flags in Nepal. 
Today is a 12.5 mile day. Not a hard day on it's own but a test of accumulative endurance.
I caught up with Mike and his sister. He showed me a pace he called ""rest step"".  Not sure if it helped any but I realized there is no need for me to try and be fast up the hills. Hike my own hike, and all that. Found some joy in hiking my own pace.  Slow up hills, careful down hills and fast on the flats. Looking at the time and feeling good I debated pushing for Blue Mtn. Shelter, an additional 7 miles.
Found the most pointless .9 mile of trail. Hog Pen. A very steep up hill and steep down hill and no view to speak of. This could have easy be traversed on contour. On the way down I felt a slight twinge in my right knee. 
At Hog Pen Gap I come across a Trail Angel, An older man give away fruit and water. While breaking there a delivery  truck stopped and warned us about a large bear he just saw.  Back to the Trail. 
Still debating to push on to Blue Mtn. my knee start to hurt more. My decision was being made for me. The last half mile was a painful. The shelter was a happy site. Just once I would like to walk up to a shelter  with out desperately awaiting for it over the last 2 miles. 
At the shelter I find the skinny younger guy, I now know as Parke (his real name), Sarah and Megan and another guy who's trail name is Ang. I never got his real name.   Over the afternoon and evening we all talked and commiserated about the previous days shared stories.   Poor Megan grilled a new comer about securing all food even wrappers in the bear bag safely way from the mice. The irony is that night a mouse chewed a hole in her pack to get a olive oil packet she left in her pack.   I also never figured out how Sarah and Megan got to the hostel head of me when they overnight ed at the Springer shelter that fist night. 
After hearing the weather forecast and the pain in my knew I amended my plan to now stay at the Blue Mtn. shelter the next night. This also sets me back and will not allow my to reach Standing Indian by  Saturday.","Mtn crossing Hostel
",Low gap shelter,"Apr 25, Wed",12.50
Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589241,"At Low Gap shelter I meet a man named Steppingwolf ( trail name maybe)  His luxuary item was a trail guitar and rolling papers, more on that later. Steppingwolf would be come our trail troubadour. 
I was amazed how much stuff was left at the shelters. In this shelter a gallon ziploc bag half full  tobacco. Parke and Megan decided to try it out and smoke some with Steppingwolf's  rolling papers. Later I heard it was tobacco left offer from some old man's blunt rolling.  
I failed to buy a new fuel canister at the hostel so I bought a large one from Parke. I did paid him for it but believe he was just unloading weight, since he over packed with two.
I ate my oatmeal and hit the trail. I was hoping my knee would be feeling better after a night sleep but it wasn't. I found myself hiking on several miles of easy trail.  I thought to myself how much it felt like walking the road around Echo Valley. Along the way I marveled at the massive cribbing along inside turns of the trail. It was beautiful stone work. I wondered why it was even there and why somebody would build it for a trail. I am ashamed to admit how long it took me to realize I was on an old road. Not just any old road, I am convinced, due to the stone work, it is an old CCC road. I might try and research this later
Even though I'm on an old road I am moving slow, It's very frustrating. This type of trail I should be able to move 3 miles an hour not the 1.5 I was moving while in pain. At this rate I will not make it to the shelter before the rain starts.
The last mile before the shelter was tedious not difficult just tedious. A mile of random large rocks relatively on contour. This type of trail would not have been a problem but my knee still hurt.  With only .1 miles left to the shelter I stopped to filter water ( a lesson I learned) when it started to rain.
Making it to the shelter i meet back up with Parke, Ang, Sarah, Megan, and later Steppingwolf. With half a day to pass we all talked joked and met new people. One of the new people was a guy from the U.K. trail named ""Mr. Tea"" (because he brewed tea on the trail). Mr Tea was talking how amazing the view was and how intriguing  the plant life was.  I then come to a realization. I have become jaded to the visuals of the southern Appalachians. The views and overlooks I found nice but not spectacular.   The plants I have seen and studied in school and only found myself annoyed when I could remember their names. I started to realize my enjoyment of the trail was coming from some place other than the trail and natural surroundings.
At this point two guys from  Georgia tech. joined us in the shelter. They were hiking south bound from Dicks Creek. After a lot whole of joking how they forgot to pack anything to eat with, not even a spoon, I bequeathed one the trial name of ""Spoons"". 
As it was still raining another man set his tent up in the shelter to move later but deiced to just leave it. As we was setting up his tent the rest of us were still talking, telling stories and jokes. This is when he announced he should have been staying in the shelter ""y'all have the craziest stories"". Another lesson on the source of my trail enjoyment.
Time for bed. 
The fail proof and simplicity of my new foam sleep pad is showing its weakness in pain my hips and shoulders. I need to learn to sleep on my back.","Low gap shelter
",Blue Mtn.,"Apr 26, Thu",7.50
Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589244,"The Blue Mtn shelter faces due East. Because of my pad not cushioning hip and shoulders I was up before sun rise.  This allowed me to watch the sun rise from my sleeping bag. 
Parke started writing in his trail journal. I somewhat envy his literary skill. He read us a passage. He has a gift to convey more than just the facts of his experience but paints a world around it AND in an entertaining style.   
While Steppingwolf played and sung while we eat and packed.  I sadly said goodbye to Sarah, Megan, Parke and Ang. It appears no matter what the trail gives me I will not be able to keep pace with them and our paths will diverge. 
After a couple miles my right knee is still in pain and me left knee starts to hurt as well. Knowing the hike up Tray Mtn is going to be work I make the decision to call it quits.   If I couldn't make Tray Mtn. today I wouldn't make Dicks creek, let alone Standing Indian by Saturday.
Sarah and Megan  caught up with me as we cross Unicoi Gap. I tell then I'm not going any farther and we parted ways. 
Now sitting along a road  with no plan a bit of panic sets in. A taxi then pulls up and drops off some hikers. There is my plan. A taxi ride into Helen Ga. Helen is a German themed town and coincidentally was Llora's Grandma's favorite get-a-way town.  After walking around some I -finally found a place open that will serve me a sandwich, It was only 10:00.  While eating I ran into Dalton again. We cheated for a minute while I waited for my ride. 
As Dad's truck pulled up my AT experiment came to an end. I learned some new things share same knowledge and had more fun that I should have had.","Blue Mtn Shelter
",Tray Mtn Shelter,"Apr 27, Fri",2.50
Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589246,"Learned a lot over the 6 days I was on the AT
First, I'm not 27 any more ( the age most of the people I was hiking with)  and am not as durable. I need to start slower and shorter days. Train harder. Take my trekking poles.  Lose 20 lbs. Can't do it out off my 22 lbs pack. It must be off my gut. I don't think my knees care where to comes from. 
I am also not 27 anymore. I can afford a taxi, shuttle or a hotel room if I have to. Plan for the expence and try not to cheap out. I will enjoy the reduced stress. No need to hitch hike.
Smart water bottles! How did I miss this memo. Take one next time.
Take what the trail give you.
Was surprised on the knowledge people didn't have. Like removing the soles out of their boots to help them dry OR hiking with a Smart water bottle! But people didn't seem to judge  but were willing to exchange knowledge. Seems everybody had something to learn.
Do a better gear testing before I hit the trail for long distances.
The AT is not the most difficult Trail I have ever hiked. It seems almost all of it felt like a combination of trails I have already hiked. Either feeling like Echo Valley Road, Pisgah or even Harbison nothing felt new. I have been normalized to the aw of the southern App. I find this saddening.
Why did I enjoy the trail so much? The people! I expected to meet people but did not expect the near instant comradery.  While this was never to be a through hike I feel perhaps cheated of the experience or like a abandoned those I meet on the trail.  
Post trail depression is real.","Home
