Foxy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519371,"28 years old, NJ Native. I want to test my physical and mental abilities with this trip. The end goal isn't necessarily to make it to Maine, but to at least start. I'm in good physical condition, but I have never tried a tru-hike before. I plan to bring my blue heeler, Koda, along with me. As long as I can get him trained up as well.I am hoping to gain from this trip, a sense of modesty and appreciation for the life I have. To no longer pine for what others possess- to get away from materialistic 'needs', and to be content with the simple necessities. My only trepidation- what If I return, and cannot reacclimatize to the normal 9-5 work day, or the routine of 'every day life' ? We will see.The plan is to start in 2017, if not then- 2018 spring. The goal is to have major finances in order, first. For example, car and student loan payments.","

Foxy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519194,"I am becoming increasingly excited to start this trip. But I am also painfully aware of the financial strain this may cause my little family ( Husband, Sean, and pup Koda). Being your average American, I do have substantial debt consisting of student loans, car payments, and credit cards.The goal for any hiker is to eliminate as much debt as possible prior to beginning their trek.   Realistically, I may need to move my start from 2017, to 2018. It is the first week of 2016, and I am not sure I can have everything paid off, on top of acquiring all the gear needed. We will see!I need to research what others do to continue their student loan/ car payments while on the trail.","

Foxy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519370,"I have lately been thinking about my gear. What, where, when to buy? The biggest thing right now is the shelter. There are soooo many options out there. I know for sure I am not the hammock type. I recently discovered a company, Tarptent. They are very affordable, between $200-$300 (that is, affordable compared to the super lightweight $500 versions of other brands). I am hung up on either the Moment ($295, 34 oz), or the ProTrail ($200, 26 oz). Weight is a big deciding factor for me, since I am only 5'2"", 114 llbs, I'll need a light load. These two tents are between 1 and 2 lbs ( Score!) Especially, since I am worried about carrying extra food for my pup, Koda. And Dog food isnt SUPER light. I need a backpack for him, but that's another story. Not to mention a camera and a couple lenses, batteries. Seems like the Moment has a bit more space for gear under shelter from rain, but that one is 1/2 lb heavier than the Protrail. I will need to decide if this extra convenience is worth the extra weight. hhmmm...","

Foxy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524013,"Since I am still in the 'real world' , planning really takes a backseat, also because 2018 is so far away. Or is it?Once in a while I really get into doing more research, and planning. But I really don't have a budget at this point, which makes me think can I actually pull this off? More so: how to pay bills while on the trail? I am married, and my husband is so supportive of this idea. But To think of leaving him upwards of six months, and expecting him to pay the household bills on top mine seems selfish and irresponsible.Another thought, is it cruel/selfish to bring your dog with you? When we got our pup a year ago, the main thought was for protection while my husband travels for work (often), and to have A hiking companion! But the more threads, and blogs I read, I get worried that is is not a good idea. The majority is saying to leave the pup at home. Obviously, I would leave the trail in a heartbeat, or send Koda home if he was in pain, or sick, or uncomfortable. Also, being courteous to other hikers is very important ( not everyone is comfortable with/loves pups).That brings me to gear. As a 114lb female, I can safely carry 30-35# of gear, I have to consider leaving room/weight for my dog's food/ first aid. And I want to train Koda to carry a light pack. I have a pack that was given to me (Gregory Amber 60 Pack - Women's) that is almost 4 lbs. Not sure if I should be worried about that. I am at least researching lightweight gear options for inside the pack. like a 2# tent, and a small cooking system. So many moving parts to consider in the planning process :P","

Foxy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548745,"OH boy, it has been a while since I sat down and recorded my thoughts. 6 months! Ridiculous. Life gets in the way, and I have been consumed with working, and took a few short trips this summer. I'm going on a little camping trip this weekend to Hershey, PA - looking forward to that!Planing for my NOBO Hike in 2018 has come to a screeching halt. I have been focussing on paying down bills and such. I really hope to still make a ThruHike in 2018, but realistically, that may be push back a year or so. I want to make sure I am prepared as much as possible. I don't think you should hit the trail with a hope and prayer, and I am a very realistic person.   So, I will just go with the flow, and continue with the leisurely planning  If it is meant to happen in 2018, it will. If not, I won't be bent out of shape.","
