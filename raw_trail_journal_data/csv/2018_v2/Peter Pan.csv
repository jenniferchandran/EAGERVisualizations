Peter Pan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572579,"Hey Friends!Currently I am sitting on the balcony of a hotel while on vacation in the middle of downtown Chicago. It's been months of views like this that have sealed my fate -- I have finally decided that I am ready to take the plunge and start preparing to hike the AT 2018. 
Let’s rewind — I’m a 28 year old man who by all accounts has a steady life. I perform onstage for a living — mostly national tours and cruise lines. I've seen the world but something has been missing — that something is being outdoors, hiking, living off the land. While I lead a very different life now, I am reminded of my college and high school days full of camping and hiking trips -- and the wonderful neglecting and unplugging from the modern world. The AT is exactly the right direction to take at this point in my life, and of that I am sure. 
I am planning on a thru hike NOBO and departing during the spring of 2018. 
What I’m looking for? That’s an open ended question really! First and foremost I am in search of a hiking buddy for the duration of the hike. 
Beyond companionship...I am looking for adventure.I am looking for trail camaraderie and all that entails.I am looking for the chance to be a part of something bigger than myself.I am looking for things that I won’t even realize I was in search of until I reach Maine.I am looking to be alive...in it's truest form.
So...welcome...er...officially to my adventure. At this point I have ordered maybe half a dozen books and trail maps, began list, after list, after list...you get it. I'm excited for this immense, overwhelming, and (fingers crossed) liberating journey. Join me from pre-planning to post journey and everything crazy antic in between! **Anyone else interested in heading out with the class of 2018 who is currently looking for a trail mate to pass the time with, contact me.- Peter Pan",,View Entry,"Jul 19, Wed",0
Peter Pan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572732,"Hey Friends!So...the last couple days I have completed the following:I have finished the book -- AWOL on the Appalachian Trail by David Miller. I've just cracked into the book, Where's The Next Shelter by Gary Sizer! (All items mentioned can be viewed and/or purchased through the links provided.)         AWOL on the Appalachian Trail     (Amazon Link)         Where's the Next Shelter?     (Amazon Link)I know that people review and criticize these books for many reasons, but as of right now I am simply reading these stories just to hear the experiences had by other hikers on the AT! I'll leave reviews at a later date. I love that something like the AT can create such a different experience for each individual that visits. So I am beyond stoked to have my own journey on her!For pre-planning and planning I've also ordered the most recent and updated versions of:                           Appalachian Trail Thru-Hike Planner                                          Appalachian Trail Thru-Hikers' Companion (2017)                                          Appalachian Trail Data Book (2017)               For further reading I've also ordered:  Appalachian Trials: The Psychological and Emotional Guide to Successfully Thru… --------------------IN OTHER NEWS!I set out today for a 12 mile hike -- It was in a state park, so the trails were quiet without many hikers -- and most campsites were still empty before the weekend crowd. It was a refreshing and enjoyable day to start out. My pack (simply for endurance purposes today) weighed approx. 27 lbs.The hike was going incredibly well the first 5 miles or so before it felt as though someone had come in and flipped the heat on. I walked a bit further and decided to take a seat on a sandbar along the creek bank. As I sat there kayakers passed by weaving between tubers riding down the creek. I opened my phone to search for service. Upon opening the weather app it said the current outside temp was 90 degrees with a heat index of 107...One. Zero. Seven. That made up my mind...I was turning around as opposed to hiking further up and waiting for the bus that returns hikers and tubers. I drank all the water I had and pumped another liter  and a half of water for the trip back. Today I managed to get ten miles in with the sweltering heat. I returned home and finished the remaining distance on the treadmill with my pack on. Overall a pretty good day, but did not get as much distance covered as I wanted! I'll be hitting the trails again on Monday.For those out on the trail -- have a beer for me tonight...wish I was there. Time for a cold beer and a night swim myself! Happy Trails.*FIND ME ON WHITE BLAZE!",,View Entry,"Jul 21, Fri",0
Peter Pan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573420,"Hi Friends!Pre-Planning is going well! I've been off the trails the last week due to a large work load! That hasn't stopped my planning though. I've received and began mapping things out with the Appalachian Trail Thru-Hikers Companion. (NOTE: I have the 2017 version currently -- I'll purchase the 2018 version and compare once it is released.) It's a great book with literally every statistic you could need. I'll post the full review with the other book reviews. (See earlier entry)I've also received a sponsorship, so I've spent the last couple days on the phone to try and get more sponsorships/contributors to my AT thru-hike. This process is actually pretty easy, just incredibly time consuming -- fingers crossed it all pays off in the end! More and more excited about hitting the trail everyday! Check out my new logo!",,View Entry,"Jul 28, Fri",0
Peter Pan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573798,"Today I am in the midwest and house sitting for my parents. I woke up and thought what better thing to do than go to my favorite old park and hike? I called up a friend and pitched the idea of a walk in the woods. She met me mid morning (coffees in hand) and we loaded up daypacks into the car! Cat Stevens' ""Peace Train"" played from my iPhone as we sipped our warm coffee and headed further into the country. 35 minutes later we are through the entrance to the park tossing our cups into the recycle bins and about to cross the suspension foot bridge into the wilderness. A surreal moment for me...I hadn't been back here in ten years. I stood there a bit amazed that this old bridge is still open for traffic! We crossed the bridge while seeing the canoes below heading down the river and could even make out a few groups having early lunch on the sandbars and boulders. 
While hiking I had this intense sense of nostalgia, and as we trudged further on I had taken a small detour down a different trail. About .5 miles in I found myself there alone -- in the middle of a dry riverbed with rock walls reaching up so high it made me feel inferior. This is bliss. I was immediately humbled my the massive structures around me and smiled before carrying on. 
We continued on the original trail along rock walls and up and down streams before reaching the ladders...ladders that reached up nearly 4 stories. Well -- here we go. We tightened our laces and headed up. Once you reach the top of the ladders there in a plateau out over the river where we had lunch and basked in the sun. 
Once we got going again -- I thought -- this feeling -- not a care in the world is what I crave most. Being at the mercy of no one other than mother nature herself. In that moment...the excitement for hitting the AT was real and tangible. 
We made it home and spent the rest of the night laying near a campfire while cooking tuna steaks, and enjoying cold beverages courtesy of Dad's bar in the old garage. I looked up at the sunset thinking...what could be more perfect. 

Happy Trails!","
