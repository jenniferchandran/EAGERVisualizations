Renegade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518769,There are so many options out there for gear. Im thinking that Im going to use some of my military gear and buy what I think I will need. Planning on doing a lot of cooking and dehydrating before hand. Mail drops are going to play a crucial role. Reading every book I can get my hands on as well as YouTube. This Trail Journal is a nice place to jot down thoughts and ideas.,,Gear and planning,"Dec 27, Sun",0
Renegade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518779,"While reading The Ultimate Hiker's Gear Guide by Andrew Skurka, I discovered a wealth of historical weather data at the Weather Underground  Hoping this will allow me to make better clothing decisions for the beginning and the end of my hike. Going to be doing a lot of research over the next year...",,More gear planning,"Dec 27, Sun",0
Renegade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520117,"I have been giving my direction some serious thought. My purpose for being on the trail is to clear out all the ""junk"" in my head. Can I do this starting at Springer and hiking within the ""bubble""? I think I will change to a Flip-Flop, starting at Harper's Ferry and heading north to Katahdin. Then, if I feel good, turn around and hike as if I was doing a SOBO... I think that this would allow me maximum time on the trail, while avoiding ""crowds""... I wont have a job or family to get back to, money wont be an issue, so i think I can extend my journey till November or December without worry. Still turning it over in my head and thinking about the extra prep (mail drops, etc). Time will tell...",,Change of Direction??,"Jan 24, Sun",0

Renegade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521498,"After untold hours of research and countless blogs and lists... I have a spreadsheet done for gear. My estimated base weight will be around 13 lbs, AND i am comfortable with the gear. Over the next few months, I am hoping to shave a another pound or so, we'll see. hopefully, I will start purchasing in June, once i get into my new house... I never imagined that walking could entail so much prep and research...",,More gear research,"Feb 21, Sun",0
Renegade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522398,"Sitting around and realized that I hadnt really thought about my hike in a few weeks. Been taking care of stuff at home, on top of retiring... Things have just been crazy. New gear list is done, it will change though...

Renegade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578449,"Been trying to get on here and update this journal. Life is crazy, you never know what its going to throw at you.  ended up putting my '17 hike off til '18.  Moved back to the East Coast after retirement, got a house, got a girlfriend ;).  She wants to hike this grand adventure with me!  She must be as crazy as i am.  Things are finally falling into place.  We have set a start date of somewhere around April 23rd.  About jumping out of my skin with anticipation!!!!!!We have both been hiking around the area and testing our gear (and our legs). Trying for as many hills as we can find.  Doing some gear replacements already, I have busted two sets of poles.  damn mud....  Also, playing with the dehydrator.  Original plan was to make most of the food ahead and then mail drop, but thinking now just mainly snacks, jerky, fruit, gorp...  maybe special meals to be shipped at specific times.Set up a FB page for us to upload to, and a YouTube channel will be coming in the near future.","
