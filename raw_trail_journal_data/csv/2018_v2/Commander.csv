US Forestry Service closed both Garenflo Gap and access to AT from Hot Springs AFTER we started due to uncontrollable wildfire. Did not met any other hikers today - wonder why? The first person I ventured upon today was a full geared-up firefighter 3 miles in the middle of nowhere! He informed me that the AT was closed. Well, a lot of good that was for me! He informed me that helicopters were inbound to drop water on the main part of the blaze. I had a front row seat for this as well as some of the fire and it's devastation. After a short time the firefighter escorted me past the main fire corridor and I hustled into the town of Hot Springs where I was met by Brenda. We checked into the Iron Horse Station and had a great meal at the Smoky Mountain Diner. All in all a good day - even though my blisters are still giving me trouble.","Garenflo Gap

Crossed numerous brooks, rills, creeks, and streams today. Many of these had primitive foot bridges.  Saw the FAA VORTAC Station up close on my hike yesterday and today I saw it ten miles across the mountain range. What a difference a day makes! Met nice older gentleman while hiking in the morning hours. As we departed, he mentioned the word ""donuts"" but offered no explanation. When I arrived at Lemon Gap about 2 miles away, I was treated to Trail Magic in the form of Krispy Kreme donuts! I only ate four before continuing my hike! At Kale Gap I ate lunch and then decided to take a short nap on a sun-kissed rock. As I completed my hike into Garenflo Gap, I was met by my bride who hiked the last 1/2 mile with me.

Hiked uphill all day today but gradient was not excessive due to climbing 4000 feet over 10 miles. Hike was significant due to seeing flaming orange azalea in the forest and experiencing Trail Magic at the TN/NC border (first time I got coffee at TM). Hike was especially memorable for me because Travis Patrick hiked the Trail with me today. Travis was one of my first cadets in NJROTC over 23 years ago and my first officer in the Corps of Cadets.

Started discussing how hikers pick up Trail names. One of most interesting tales was “ Dirty Money.” Dirty Money had never hiked/camped before hitting the AT this spring. The first time he visited the privy (head, latrine, toilet), he thought toilet paper was provided. Of course he thought wrong. But he did have his wallet with him. Thus the name, Dirty Money!

It rained from the time we stepped on the Trail until we exited the Trail and even continued afterwards! I was soaked from head to toe. Everything in my backpack was wet with the exception of a Clif bar. We had numerous stream crossings today, many with foot bridges. As bad as the weather was today, we still met over 20 hikers —- all were wet or in the process of getting wet. Also hiked about half mile on Virginia Creeper Trail (bicycle trail). All in all a good day - not a great day, but a good day. Planning to attend Trail Days in Damascus on Saturday.

What a difference a day makes. Probability of heavy rain was 80% and we received absolutely nothing.  Unlike yesterday where we were soaked the whole day! The skies were overcast which made for a very pleasant hike. Saw many scenic views and numerous wildflowers today. Saw three separate herds of wild ponies at the State Park.

It would probably be more appropriate to say I WADED 18 miles than hiked 18 miles because the entire trail was flooded and we had to cross over 50 streams, creeks, brooks, etc.  Got to see more wild ponies, longhorn cattle, and numerous water falls along the Trail. Hiked the entire section of trail in about 7 hours today due to gentle ascents/descents, fairly level Trail, and motivation to get out of rain as soon as possible! Only met two other hikers today - it seems most hikers had the good sense to stay out of the rain! Plan to attend Trail Days in Damascus, VA tomorrow.

It was a beautiful day on the AT - of course every day is beautiful on the AT (even when it rains!). Observed extremely large Mayapple plants, several foot bridges, and a stile fence crossing. Walked thru the green tunnel mist of the day as the trees are starting  to leaf out. Much of the Trail was muddy and wet today due to last nights horrific thunderstorms. Met and hiked with “Easy” today. Easy and I had some great conversations and the Trail miles flew by as we talked. Easy and I are both Naval Aviators and both of us have a passion for investing. Oh, by the way, I weighed myself for the first time since departing on the Trail. I have lost 22 pounds. (I also lost two pocket knives and a T-Shirt!) Happy Trails.

Met thru-hikers Squeak and Fuego who are married and are from Ottawa, Nav (SD), Dragon (Detroit) and Yelp (Eng). We hiked with these hikers for a short time and learned they had been hiking together since 24 March. WOW! Today on the Trail we spotted a red eft, a forest of ferns, a blooming patch of Mayapples, and a one room schoolhouse built in 1894, with adjacent privy. Once again it rained on us the majority of the hike. The Trail is nothing but mud, muck, and more (except where there are jagged rocks)! The streams are all swollen due to excessive rains over the past week or so. My right knee has been hurting me and I took a very nasty spill as I was getting ready to cross a stream. I hurt my left hip/thigh and am sporting a huge bruise. To make matters worse, my fall was observed by about 15 other hikers! Eventually I got up and continued to hike. Tomorrow is another day.

We had numerous fence crossings today that used stiles, gates, and walk-arounds.  We also had several creek and stream crossings that proved interesting due to recent rains. The Trail was still muddy and mucky because of those same rains.  I was able to use a knee brace on my right knee today and that seemed to help ease the pain in addition to me shortening my stride and decreasing my hiking pace.

Today’s hike was one of the easiest to date, as far as inclines and descents and trail surfaces were concerned. Many nice views and tranquil river and steam crossings were witnessed today. Passed a fairly extensive burn area today. Do not know if it was a controlled or uncontrolled burn - of course I guess that does not matter now.  About one mile of Trail was on gravel and paved roads - disappointing to me!

Everything got soaked early and thoroughly (which included my PB&J sandwich) but it was a great day on the AT. I did not meet another hiker until I had hiked almost four hours. I used this time to reflect on the true meaning of Memorial Day. For almost four hours I thought about all my friends who had died in service for the country. I remembered all my veteran friends and their sacrifices, and the veterans that I helped to bury. I then tried to recall all my former cadets who joined the military after completing NJROTC and graduating from high school-that is no small number! It indeed was a great day on the AT. I had 27 water crossings today and 12 had some sort of foot bridge - but that did not really matter today since I was soaked to the bone anyway. I also transited a major burned out section of the Trail, but it is starting to rejuvenate.  Blonde Lady met me at the completion of the section hike today- that is always a positive.

Over 100 inch worms covered my body with several of them biting/stinging me. I was actually glad to have the rain today to get rid of inch worms! Only saw a very few vistas today due to the reduced visibility from rain. Although I did see several different types of wild flowers. I ran into a six foot black snake towards the end of the Trail. He left me alone and I did the same for him! The Trail was covered thoroughly with mud and muck and I descended over 1000 feet from Angel’s Rest on a very steep and precarious trail which necessitated slow hiking!

Saw several deer, many squirrels and chipmunks, no snakes, and one black bear today. Crossed Skyline Drive several times today and was treated to outstanding vistas each and every time! Unusual tidbit for today: I had no major stream crossings today which is highly unusual! Today’s highlights: 1) passed 900 official Trail miles today - Yeah! and 2) picked up at Trails End by Blonde Lady! Happy Trails.

Harriet (Ozzie’s wife) hiked the entire section of the trail and provided many interesting insights. Kevin, an FBI Agent, joined us on the Trail and proved to be a very strong hiker. Psych, a retired USAF officer, hiked with us for a short while until I started telling him jokes and then he mysteriously got a burst of energy and hiked away from us! Saw a multitude of day/section hikers today due to excellent weather and free entry into the SNP.  Observed routine flora and fauna in the SNP today with the exception of the superfluous snail that had everyone diverting off the Trail with stark terror. Saw several magnificent views as we cross-crossed Skyline Drive. Trail surface was rocky today which made for slow, deliberate hiking. The best part of the hike was at Trail End where I was not only met by Blonde Lady, but also by my two daughters, Sarah and Grace. What a great Father’s Day gift!

Hike was fairly easy today due to mild temperatures, low humidity, gradual climbs and descents, and fairly smooth trail surface. Saw a multitude of day hikers probably due to good weather and Father’s Day. Lots of bear activity was reported along Skyline Drive. We saw a large black bear crossing the road on the way to TrailHead. Two separate thru-hikers mentioned to me that they each had seen five bears earlier in their hike.

The terrain was somewhat rocky and it had its share of fairly steep ups and downs.   We saw a medium sized black bear and I took several pictures of him. (The black bear got several good pictures of me running away from him!) I also encountered a fairly large copperhead snake as I was filtering water from a spring. Met two new thru-hikers: Stretch (USMA 2010) and Ms Roberts (FL).  Ran into Crayola, who we have not seen in several weeks, at Gravel Springs Gap.

Completed the entire Shenandoah National Park section today. Trail was mostly mundane today but I did spot some pink and white wild roses next to the Trail that were absolutely beautiful. I also saw one of the most interesting shelters on the AT, the Jim &Molly Denton Shelter. We ate lunch there but did not remain overnite. In addition to the Shelter being superbly maintained, it had a porch area with Adirondack chairs, a horseshoe pit, a gazebo with picnic table, a privy with toilet paper and hand sanitizer, and a solar shower! All the comforts of home!  We were drenched by afternoon thunderstorm only 20 minutes before completing the hike - but it was most welcome since it cooled us off tremendously!

Easy hike, all things considered - fairly level terrain, cooler temps, lower humidity, few steep climbs or descents and a good breakfast! At start of hike we observed a stone wall that was erected along a short portion of the Trail by persons unknown.  Since we are off Skyline Drive and back into the green tunnel in the forest, we saw no vistas today. However, we did travel through a meadow of Sky Meadows State Park and I was able to rest on a special bench for hikers and I did photograph some flowers that were beautiful and aromatic. Wild life observed today were squirrels, rabbits, chipmunks, and a box turtle. One unusual tidbit today: I encountered NO section, Day, or Thru-hikers on the Trail today-highly irregular!

Hiked less than two hours and then we were greeted by RAIN. Crossed several streams with foot bridges today. Trail was extremely muddy and slippery due to massive rains over night. Saw numerous animal tracks in the mud-deer, raccoon, and bear. What a difference a day makes - yesterday we did not see any thru-hikers and today we must have seen 20 different ones, some we knew and others were new like: Sir Charles, Handstand, Pony Boy, Strider, Ray Rack, and Rocky. Entered the Roller Coaster which is a 14 mile stretch of extensive climbs and descents. Should finish this section tomorrow afternoon. Highlight for today - surpassed the 1000 mile mark on the Trail!

And boy did it rain! Most of the hike today was walking up what seemed like deep streams and creeks. There were two stellar highlights to today’s hike. We finally hiked out of the state of Virginia after being there for 35 days!  Hello West Virginia, state #5. Second and most importantly, one of my college buddies, Howard Hempenius, came to hike the AT with me - and he probably could not have picked a worse day, weather wise! But that did not deter him. He slapped on his pack and donned a poncho and off we went. I had an absolutely grand time walking, talking, and rehashing old memories with him.

We started off in rain (again) and found the Trail to be saturated. As a matter of fact, it was like fording a 12.5 mile wide stream or creek! Saw a couple of interesting plants and flowers which included the milkweed plant that is favored by the Monarch butterfly.  Met three new lady thru-hikers: Sawbones, Squeaks, and Butterfly (not the one that likes the milkweed).  Walked across bridge that spans the Potomac River. This is the river that George Washington supposedly threw a silver dollar across - that is most likely true since a dollar went farther in those days!  We arrived in Harper’s Ferry and were greeted by Blonde Lady and Howard “Dutch” Hempenius, a long time friend and classmate. I registered as a thru-hiker with the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and then had lunch with Ozzie and Harriet, Blonde Lady, Dutch, and his wife, Maureen.

Visited and viewed several historic sites in Harper’s Ferry before taking the old C&O railroad bridge into my sixth state, Maryland. The level and flat terrain made quick hiking for Ozzie and me. We met a multitude of hikers traveling in the opposite direction which made for exceedingly slow progress when we always paused to talk with them and inform them about thru-hiking. Around 9:00 am the sun made a rare appearance which startled both of us and all other hikers in the region! Later that morning we hiked into Gathland State Park and were treated to invaluable Civil War and turn-of-the-century information. Throughout the day we hiked in numerous areas that were home to Civil War battles and skirmishes. This made for a fun, interesting, and educational experience. The most interesting thing in the State Park was the War Correspondents Monument, which was massive! Had some pretty good views from White Rock Cliffs. Met new thru-hikers: Boomerang and Stair Stepper (father and son) and Send It (Ohio). Met by Blonde Lady and got ice cream at Nutters in Sharpsburg, MD. Happy Trails.

This monument was built in 1827 by the citizens of Boonsboro, MD and was the first monument to be dedicated to George Washington. From atop the monument you can see the states of Maryland, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania.  Today’s hike afforded several scenic views, but was mostly concentrated on stepping on or around an abundance of rocks. Rocks were everywhere and every description! And I hear it gets worse when the Trail enters Pennsylvania which is only five miles away! I did receive Trail Magic today when I crossed the road to Smithsburg. “Slug,” a Thru-hiker took a zero day so he could supply cold drinks on a hot day to fellow thru-hikers. Water and Gatorade were very much appreciated. Met a new thru-hiker, Round-about-Rath, who is flip-flopping. He started in Massachusetts and is hiking to Georgia.

I will let you know. Saw and observed  a large owl for several minutes this morning - it was majestic! Also saw a colorful oriole this afternoon and did not realize how vibrant it’s plumage was! Crossed the Mason-Dixon Line and entered into northern territory around noon time today. Ozzie and I must have crossed a dozen roads today as we negotiated the Trail. Drivers seem to have little regard for old, slow hikers trying to get to the other side of the road. This is true on not only paved, divided roads, but also gravel and dirt roads! Stopped at three shelters today. We ate lunch at Deer Lick Shelter along with five other thru-hikers and two day hikers. We visited Antietam Shelter and experienced Trail Magic for the second day in a row! Finally we checked out Tumbling Run Shelter which is very unique. This shelter has a floral arrangement on the picnic table which is in a gazebo. It has a clothes line, upscale privy, bear poles, two fire rings, pea gravel common area, and now get this - separate snoring and non-snoring sleeping areas!  All in all a good day. Happy Trails.

We traveled through a short rhododendron tunnel and a small evergreen forest. We passed by a small cabin in the woods that is rented out to certain individuals by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. Yesterday I saw what I thought was the best shelter ever on the AT and mentioned it in my comments. Well, what a difference a day makes - I was mistaken!

However, during that time, we reached the official and certified halfway mark and also passed the 1100 mile benchmark!  We hiked into Pine Grove Furnace State Park where we visited the AT Museum and saw one of the very first AT shelters (and it was primitive!).  But before we entered the State Park, we experienced Trail Magic. I was treated to a quart of the best and coldest chocolate milk I have ever had! Yum Yum.  In the afternoon I hiked alone and covered over eight miles in 2 1/2 hours, which was moving fairly quickly. Met new thru-hikers: Newt (MD), Butch Cassidy, and Sundance Kid. I neglected to report yesterday that I met a family of Thru-hikers: Chin Strap (Dad), Yertl (Mom), John Travolta(Son), Squeaks (Daughter), and Funshine (Daughter) all from Minnesota.  Excellent temperature for hiking and  gentle ups and downs made for Happy Trails.

Traveled through a rock maze about three miles into hike that was both challenging and fun. I actually had to scramble over several rock formations. Thru-hikers, Safety and Sir Charles, both passed me at different times after the maze. During the hike in the morning, I was feeling somewhat drained and then I received a cell phone call from Ed Talley that boosted my spirits and even put a little pep in my step! I met Rebound, who was slack packing south bound, and about a dozen other section hikers today. Around noon, I entered the town of Boiling Springs where I visited the local ATC, topped off my water, and had a quick snack. The Trail in the afternoon was flat and muddy.

Ed Talley called me on Saturday to inform me that he and Brad Miller had hiked 5 miles at Steele Creek Park in 1 1/2 hours that morning. He challenged me to do the same. Well, all things NOT being equal, I accepted the challenge today since I would be hiking solo. The terrain was relatively flat but the heat index reached 110 at noon. Temps were in the high 90s all day. I started the hike in mid-morning and completed the 12.4 miles in 3:40 hours and 4 liters of water! I think that was comparable to Ed and Brad. Challenge met! Passed several major road crossings today like I-81, US 11, and the PA Turnpike, as well as numerous other paved and gravel roads. Much of todays hike was through corn fields and in direct sun. Used several fence stiles to transit farmer fields with various livestock. Ventured upon a seven foot black snake that got my heart beating a little faster!

We had to scramble or boulder through the Knife Edge and Bear Rocks for about a half mile or so when I cut a finger on an angular rock. Then we had to scramble up Oven Bake Knob which afforded great views but the majestic rocks were totally desecrated with graffiti and the litter was prolific. What a shame! After lunch, we encountered a steep and lengthy descent into the south bank of the Lehigh River. After crossing the river, our lives were in imminent danger as we crossed a super busy four lane road where traffic was fast and unyielding.

Commander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597087,"Day 100. I cannot believe that I have been on the Trail for 100 days. More importantly, I have Pennsylvania in my rear view mirror. What a challenging state! Hiked 16.8 miles from Wind Gap, PA to Kittatinney Visitor Center, NJ. Today’s hike included a friend of Wander Woman, Annie and her dog , a black lab mix named Bear. What a joy to hike with them. The Trail was once again extremely rocky with little relief from the rocks today. I did met two new thru-hikers: Miller 55 and Mayday. Ate lunch at Kirkridge  Shelter with Safety, Dragon, Nav, Wizard, and Spinelli. Observed the pups of a Luna moth while there. In order to leave PA, we had to walk across a very long bridge spanning the Delaware River and paralleling I-80 which was exceedingly busy. However, Blonde Lady was waiting at the Visitor Center that made everything normal again. Happy Trails.Be sure to check out all the photos I’ve posted on trail journals under “photos”.","Wind Gap, PA

Much bear activity was reported but The Three Amigos did not spot any bears. However, we did see and stepped in some bear scat! The most dangerous animal that I saw today was a hyper-active chipmunk! Rocks once again dominated the Trail even though we are in New Jersey! We did observe some very interesting stone cairns and monuments. Met many section and day hikers but saw only four thru-hikers: Boomerang, Snail Trainer, Freight Train, and Pace. Ate lunch at scenic overlook. Saw many vistas today since much of hike was not in the “green tunnel.” The vistas looked magnificent, although I did not know exactly what I was seeing! Other interesting sites seen today were a manned fire tower named Catfish Lookout, a swamp named Rattlesnake Swamp, and a large pond called Sunfish Pond. All in all, a very enjoyable first day in New Jersey. Met by Blonde Lady at Trails End. Happy Trails.

Commander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597391,"Day 102. Hiked 16.0 miles from Blue Mountain Lakes Road to Sunrise Mountain. Weather was foggy and rainy at start of hike but air was cool which made for speedy hiking. However, speedy hiking and wet rocks caused me to take another nasty fall. Once again I had only a few scratches and hurt ego! Soon after my fall, we saw our first porcupine and then watched him shimmy up a tree! Fascinating! We continued to hike over many jagged rocks but we did enter a pine forest which provided comfort for our feet.  The weather cleared in the early afternoon and we were treated to great vistas. We had a leisurely lunch overlooking a large lake and finished the hike in mid-afternoon. Blonde Lady was at Sunrise Mountain as expected-what a Lady!

Weather at start of hike was warm and clear with rain in the forecast. I was sluggish throughout most of the morning hike until we stopped at High Point State Park. There I filled my empty water bottles and drank a free ice cold Pepsi offered to all thru-hikers by the Park Staff. That seemed to revive me! We then hiked to the highest point in NJ and took a picture of the monument located  there. A quick lunch followed at High Point Shelter and then we were off for an afternoon of speedy hiking. The skies were overcast with thunderstorms threatening. The temperature was cooler, the terrain less rocky, and the topography more level. We were able to knockout 8 miles in less than 2 1/2 hours even though we walked about  1/2 mile on a wooded platform through a marsh. Saw plenty of wild life today: chipmunks, squirrels, and deer.

Weather at start was sunny, warm, and clear while in the afternoon a torrential thunderstorm engulfed the area and caught us about halfway up a 1000 foot climb. Needless to say, we got soaked while hiking through ankle deep water on the Trail and crossing raging and swollen streams. We hiked through marshes, farm meadows, county roads, cow pastures, lowland woods, rock fields, and finally mountains. We hiked on a wooden boardwalk near Vernon, NJ that was well over a mile in length. We saw an abundance of wild life: chipmunks, squirrels, and deer are common but we also saw great heron, egrets, water turtles, snapping turtles, miniature toads, bull frogs, mourning doves, ravens, and a mama bear with four cubs. We experienced Trail Magic twice today. Once was in the form of fresh local fruits and about an hour later we received a cold soda. The only thru-hikers we saw today were Sunshine, Granny Gear, and Mouse Trap who were smarter than the Three Amigos because they sought shelter during the Thunderstorm! Blonde Lady was at Trail’s End once again!

Weather today was absolutely perfect - clear, cool, very low humidity! This was a welcome change from yesterday where we were most fortunate not to be hurt or injured from the massive thunderstorm that caused extensive water and wind damage to a wide spread area. Hike began climbing huge (and I mean BIG) rocks. Movement was slow and tedious all morning. Most ascents required use of at least one hand, if not both hands and one climb even had embedded rebar as a ladder to assist hikers! When we stopped at a Trail Head for lunch we were treated to Trail Magic - twice. First, was ice cold Gatorade. Then we walked off Trail to an ice cream shop and I was pleasantly treated to a sub sandwich, fresh fruits, chips, veggies, and cold drinks! I never did get the ice cream I wanted! Hiking in the afternoon was much easier because of the gentler terrain and topography. However, we did have one rock edifice to climb. As I was reaching to grab a rock with my hand, I placed it right next to a five foot black snake. Needless to say, I was taken aback and quickly pulled my hand back! Met a bunch of new thru-hikers today: Rock Hopper (TN), Root 66 (TN), Greasy (DC), Chip (NJ), Highlander (Scot), Puff Puff (Eng) and Professor. Blonde Lady met me at Trails End and took me out for ice cream! Happy Trails.Be sure to check out all the photos I’ve posted on trail journals under “photos”.","Warwick Turnpike in Vernon, NY

Commander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597669,"Day 106.  Hiked 16.7 really tough miles from West Mombasha Road to  Palisades Parkway. Hike started with beautiful weather and a rocky trail. The weather remained great all day but the rocks increased in both size and number!  Hiking was slow and tedious until mid-afternoon. Many rock formations had to be climbed using all fours. One formation, Lemon Squeezer, was so narrow that I had to remove my pack in order to “squeeze” through it! We ate lunch in a blueberry patch near Fingerboard Shelter. Thankfully, the Trail in the afternoon was much more genteel and we were able to hike at a faster rate. We played leap frog through out the day with Passenger. Met new thru-hikers: Cinna Bun, PeeDub, and Mr Hiker (SoBo from NC). Blonde Lady was at Trails End after touring West Point during the day.

Commander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597820,"Day 107. Hiked 14.5 fairly easy miles today from Palisades Parkway to Graymoor Spiritual Life Center and surpassed 1400 official Trail miles.  The most dangerous part of the hike was trying to cross the four lane Palisades Pkwy with bumper to bumper traffic traveling at Mach 3! When we got on the Trail, the miles melted away quickly in the cool morning air and we were treated to several nice scenic views. Several hours into the hike, we arrived at the George Perkins Memorial Tower where we could barely see the NYC Skyline through the haze. As we continued down from the tower, we were routed through a state park and decided to lunch there. Try as I might, I could not get any picnickers to share their lunch with me! After lunch, if you can believe it, the Trail went through a small zoo where we saw two bears - a grizzly and a black bear sleeping in a hammock!  We then crossed the Hudson River on an automobile bridge with a pedestrian walkway. We had a couple of steep climbs in the afternoon but also several miles of gentle terrain.

Commander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597899,"Day 108.  Hiked 19.1 miles from Graymoor Spiritual Center to Taconic State Parkway with the goal of out running a major storm system (we succeeded). At the very beginning of the Trail we observed  the foundation of an old house commemorating the “inoculations” ordered by George Washington in 1776 for all his troops. Later in the afternoon we saw an American Flag painted atop a mountain memorializing the victims of 9/11. Just prior to completing the hike we stopped at a fairly new shelter and met 11 hikers who were planning to “hold up” there for the ensuing storm. The ceiling of the shelter was most unique in that it had a hiker’s legs with shoes poking through the ceiling. The shelter also had a well kept flower garden attached. Blonde Lady was at trail’s terminus. Happy Trails.

The weather forecast was very foreboding today but did not develop. We did get wet from rain dripping from the trees and from the high humidity. The hike today was unremarkable as far as vistas and interesting things to see. I did notice a plethora of downed trees that were uprooted by a straight line wind shear last year and caused us to divert around them. We ate lunch at a shelter and talked with “Passenger” during that time. He was the only NoBo that we saw today. We did met one SoBo hiker along with several day hikers. The weather probably deterred most weekend hikers. At trail’s end we saw the Dover Oak, which is the largest oak on the AT and estimated to be over 300 years old and has a trunk diameter of 6 feet. Blonde Lady arrived as we completed our hike. Tomorrow we plan to take a zero day (no hiking) to avoid weather and to rest.

Made excellent time for 15 miles - in less than five hours - WOW. However, final five miles were most difficult and took us another five hours!

A nor’ easterner was dumping a ton of rain on the AT and we had two extremely steep and hazardous, as well as long, descents near St Johns Ledges. To make the descents more dangerous, the rocks were wet and slippery and were getting wetter and more slippery! Thankfully all Three Amigos made it down the rock faces!  We walked for several miles along the Housatonic  River and I found that very enjoyable, peaceful, and relaxing.  We saw very few hikers today due to weather and I took no pictures as a result of the constant rain.

Plus I felt really good - I slept almost nine hours last night-WOW!  Only saw four hikers on this beautiful day today: two NoBo’s, one section hiker from Chicago, and a man, who for some strange reason was taking the AT to buy stamps at the Post Office! Took a photo of a fantastic view from “Rand’s View” but pic does not do it justice!

At the first road crossing we saw the monument for Shay’s Rebellion in 1787 as we tried to remember our American history. The next road crossing resulted in Trail Magic provided by two local churches where I had great conversation and a hamburger, watermelon, and homemade baked goods. Less than a mile of hiking later, we approached another road crossing (gotta love road crossings) and were treated to Trail Magic again. This time it was provided by Trail Angel Joe who fixed me a ham and cheese sandwich, two cokes, a snickers bar, and several cookies. Life is good!

Surprisingly very few bugs harassed me on the hike. The terrain was slightly muddy but the climbs/descents were relatively gentle. Because of these factors, and the fact that there was NO Trail Magic at any of the road crossings today, we were able to complete the hike in well less than 6 hours!  We did see and interact with numerous day/section hikers and continued to play leap frog with husband and wife NoBo’s, Big Tuna and Kaleidoscope. We briefly talked with NoBo, Beetle, who was running and trying to complete 50 miles in one day! WOW.  Blueberry bushes with ripe berries were abundant along the Trail today and made for good munching. We also saw a well constructed beaver dam on Swann Pond along with a stunning vista or two.

Rocks and roots on the Trail were especially slippery and the mud bogs were able to multiply. There was one challenging and steep climb but for the most part, the Trail was fast and enjoyable. As a matter of fact, the Trail went right by Dartmouth College in Hanover. We were treated to Trail Magic on two occasions. Bob Gibson hiked with the Three Amigos once again and seems to be holding up very well. There was no notable scenic views other than crossing the Connecticut  River to enter the state of New Hampshire. (State number 13!).

We had three major climbs with the biggest at Smarts Mountain and Fire Tower which culminated in a 2200 foot climb and no view whatsoever! The ascent to Mount Cube was just a little over 1000 feet and had a fairly descent view.  During the hike we saw 15 young Dartmouth students transporting massive beams for 2 miles on their backs to construct bridges over the mud bogs.  It was amazing - I told them that I would have to volunteer for that job, because there is not enough money in the world to pay me to do it!  After 19 strenuous miles I was totally exhausted but I got rejuvenated at terminus when I was not only greeted by Blonde Lady, but also by two academy classmates, Tommy Storch and Bob Gibson.

Took me 4 hours to go 4.8 miles to climb Mt Moosilauke today.  I ascended over 4000 feet and the summit was surrounded in clouds with no views.  Such is my luck.  I was fortunate to have Tommy Storch, my college roommate, hike with me a short distance today.

As we were entering TrailHead we saw a moose and her calf, which delighted everyone!  Commenced hiking on fairly level terrain for several miles and then experienced the LONG and STEEP ascent for many more miles.

We were rewarded with numerous scenic views of the surrounding mountains.  Just prior to lunch we reached Carter Notch Hut where I feasted on a hot bowl of soup, gingerbread cake, and coffee.  After lunch we began hiking again and I only fell a single time in the afternoon which I term a major accomplishment because of the numerous precarious and steep downhills!  We arrived at the shelter around 5:00 pm and were able to get floor space along with about a dozen other hikers.  After a quick dinner of peanut butter wraps and trail mix, I turned in for the night at 7:00 pm.  Hope the tired, old body will rejuvenate by morning.

For 1.1 miles you are constantly crawling over, under, around, or through large boulders - many times dragging or pushing your backpack! In addition to being fun or difficult (your choice), it is dangerous. I was fortunate not to fall here, but I did suffer several cuts, scraps, and bruises to my legs and arms.
