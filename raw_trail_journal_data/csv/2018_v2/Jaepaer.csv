I chose the Osprey Exos 58L. Anyone have any thoughts on that selection. Besides the backpack, I have a few misc. items to gather but mostly need to get some food.

Jaepaer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585286,"my first post since starting my hike. I can tell you that it is Not an easy hike out of the gate. 40% of Thru-Hikers have already quit! Georgia is really a tough hike, where over half will drop out. A man doing trail magic at one of the Gaps said the drop out rate is higher this year than previous years. Who knows. But I can say that I have yet to get wet. Very very lucky, but it is coming. Today, Friday the 30th, I am taking a zero day. Stayed in Helen Georgia last night and will be getting a ride back to Unicoi Gap this evening where I left off. I will tent there then continue my hike oh the morning. The next 17 mi is the toughest part in Georgia. My next re-supply and zero day will be in Franklin NC. Which is 57 miles. I will be there in 6 or 7 days. Therefore, I will be posting again when I am in Franklin. I reached Springer Mountain on Sat., M24 at 12:10 pm. This is the official start of the AT. Started the AT 10 min later at 12:20. It was cloudy all day except just when I started, that is when the sun came out from behind the clouds for maybe 30 sec. I took that as a Positive Sign!In concluding, I have hiked 61 mi total, with 52 being on the AT.","Amicalola Falls State Park

Jaepaer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585287,"a couple side notes: a Safety Meeting on the AT means pot smoking time. Yellow Balzers are those that skip sections of the hike. These people are not true thru-hikers. I am surprised that young people do this too. Some in their early 20’s. For the record, I do neither.All hikers have been really good. No issues st all. And then there is trail magic. That has happened four times already. Once was at a hostel at Neal’s Gap. A group from First Baptist Church in Blairsville feed us which included meat lasagna, salad, brownies, drinks, etc. one last note, there is an 80 yr old lady thru hiking the AT, her trail name is Sweet Pea. I hope she makes it.","

Jaepaer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585865,"I have currently hiked 109.2 miles. Today, I am taking a zero day and staying in Franklin, NC. Franklin is like Mayberry USA. My hike at this point has been good. While a physical challenge ( as I mentioned in my previous post), I am getting stronger and hiking better. As an example, the past two days, I have hiked 23.5 miles. 12.1 on Wed and 11.4 on Thurs. The past six days, I have hiked appropriately 57 miles.This morning, at 7:15, First Baptist Church in Franklin Shuttled us to and from breakfast which they provided at their Church, which included coffee, juice, pancakes, bacon, etc.-All you can eat! It is very generous and thoughtful of them to provide this to the thru-hikers. As of this morning, they have feed over 700.I have been the recipient of two single packages of Starbucks coffee from two hikers. One a weekend hiker from Atlanta   named Hiking Barbie 24 (she looks like Hiking Barbie), gave me a Vanilla Latte while the other named Cowbell from Chicago 29,gave me a Carmel Frappuccino. Do not only is there trail magic from non-hikers, but also among hikers themselves.Next is to make it to the Smokies which is about 58 miles. I have included photos, check them out.

Jaepaer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586500,"First, I want to thank all who are following. It means much and provides a boost! Since my last post, I have hiked from Windind Stairs to Fontana. My total hiking mileage is now 165.5. Tomorrow I will be crossing Fontana Dam and entering The Great Smoky Mountains Park. I am now 32 mi from Clingman’s Dome and 39 fromNewfound Gap. One of these two destinations I will be picked up by one of my brothers, Burt and possibly Kare Ann. The pickup will depend on the weather. Sun n Mon could produce cold, rainy and snowy weather. I look forward to them doing this and our trip into Gatlinburg!From there I will meet up with second cousin Wes White for a few hiking miles. After that I will be meeting up with Steve n Carrie Peacock in Hot Springs, NC. The three toughest climbs have been in NC. One of which is approximately named Jabob’s Ladder, it’s vertically is unreal. This climb along with the one from Nantahala has worn me down somewhat. In addition to all the other climbs in between.i actually had my worst hiking day yesterday. I went to sleep at 7:30 to 4:30, maybe waking up for 30 seconds to roll over. Yoday’s Hike ok, do maybe tomorrow I will feel physically better.Tomorrow bolds another tough climb out of the gate. Also, in the first few miles of theGSMNP, there has been a bear ripping up tents (2) as they were being slept in; therefore, the first shelter n campsite has been closed down. In closing, to this point it has been a wonderful experience. I will be listing Thru-hikers Names n where they are from in the near future. I will start with the ones out of country. Such a Luch fromSwitzerland. He said that he did not like hiking in the wilderness so he flew back to Switzerland. Luch is 25 yrs of age.I am going to post some pics now, enjoy.","

Jaepaer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586882,"since my last post, I have hiked 8 straight days, approximately 90 miles. NC has the 5 most challenging climbs thus far in my hike. Compared to Georgia (which up n down constantly), NC Trail is in better shape, more flat or and gradual ups n downs, needs more white blazes in spots, but make no mistake, it is not easier than GA. It has worn me down to an extent but I seem to recuperate well.My brother Burt picked me up Sunday (yesterday) at Clingman’s Dome parking lot. I got there at 2:40 pm. (Day was rainy, foggy with very strong gusts of winds). I thank Burt for picking me up ( though he really did not like the drive up there) and putting me up for the night and taking me to eat at Texas Roadhouse. He and Karen Ann also picked up some stuff I needed and brought it to me. Thank you Burt n Karen Ann!!The scenery is most beautiful in the mountains. There is nothing like standing on top of a mountain, such as a place called “Rocky Top” and looking beyond the casts ranges of mountains. The hike to this juncture has been most enjoyable. There are a lot of decent, caring, and sincere people thru Hiking. A lot of younger people, male and female, that are very impressive in their demeanor and intellect among other qualities. A lot of hikers in their 20’s. Saturday I met a Mexican Family, Mother, Father and son I would guess is 12, which were day hiKing, talked to the father a few minutes and he was very much interested in thru-hiking. They went ahead of me and when I saw them the boy comes up to me and offers me a sandwich and cool ranch Doritos. I took some Doritos and later he tried to give me the whole bag, a big bag. Very considerate and thoughtful.I have now hiked just under 200 miles on the AT. I am taking 2 days off-to recuperate- and then back to Clingman’s Dome to continue my Northward journey. I appreciate all following and comments!And signing the guest book. Thank you!I next stop and a couple days off will be in Hot Springs, NC. It is about 74 miles, maybe 6 or 7 day hike.Hikers from other countries:Ky-Germany-23Mattason-New Zealand-20?German Lady-Germany-45-50?Timber-Nicaragua-55?Mark-Devon,England-43Luch-Switzerland-25 (flew back to Switzerland)Rainbow-Australia-18Slayer-England-28Jeans-England-30Smoking Bear-Switzerland-55-60?Swiss Miss-Switzerland-55-50?","

We went to Knoxville on Mon where I picked up a couple things at REI, resupplied at Walmart (food), Switche my phone service to Verizon ( which does much better in the mtns), tookBurt’s truck by carmax and visited Donald, Amanda, Mr. Duke and Neely. Got to play Trucks w/ Mr. Duke, tons of fun! Also, Amanda fed us.We had baked spaghetti, and may I add that it was awesome!! Thx Amanda!!
So since Gatlinburg/Knoxville, I have hiked: Wed, 11.1 miles, Thurs: 12.6 m, Fri: 14.8 m, Sat: 10.5 m but this was my best hiking day so far! Climbed over 3000 ft with one climb being 2500 ft. Handled it very well. I could have hiked 3 more hrs but decided to stay in shelter tonight, which was built in 1939 and could use an upgrade ( Groundhog Creek Shelter).
Thursday’s hike was very cold! It was like hiking in Winter Wonderland w/very strong winds. You will know what I mean when u look at the pics. I one point I thought it was snowing, but no. Than I thought that the strong winds were blowing pedals to help the Forrest regenerate itself. Nope. I was happening is that fog had turned to ice on the trees and than the wind was blowing it off the trees, in rectangular form. Some being about 3”x1”. Fog Ice.
In concluding, my hike is going well and I keep getting better. It is very enjoyable.
I have 27 miles to go to Hot Springs, NC to take some time off the trail and to meet up w/ Steve n Carrie Peacock. I am looking forward to seeing them!
Thx all for all ur support!

Jaepaer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587980,"I arrived in Hot Springs, NC on Mon., at 5 pm on April 23rd. Now Hot Springs has very very poor cell service. At places, very few, one can get a text out but no phone calls. So the reason I mention this is because I have a very good friend and his wife (which is also a friend) which I was to meet (Steve and Carrie Peacock). I had not been able to connect w/ them since Saturday. They drove their camper down from Indiana to meet up w/me for a couple days. So I stopped by the hostel to take a much needed shower then went into town to get some dinner. Now Hot Springs is a very small town, so I thought that maybe I would see them there somewhere. I stopped at the Iron Horse and as I walked in, a group of hikers invited me to eat w/them. Their table was just inside the door. So I took them up on their offer. As I was finished eating and asked for my check, I looked up and Steve and Carrie were leaving. They had been up front the whole time but we had not seen each other. I got their attention and we carried on from there. Had a great time with them. I had a very comfortable place to sleep for 3 nights and was fed very well by them. Thanks Steve and Carrie!! Especially for the Bannana bread!Took Tues and Wed off and will be back on the trail tomorrow morning, Thursday 4/26. At this point, I have hiked 274.5 miles or 12.6% of the AT. I will say the last 3 to 4 hiking days have been my best. Mountains are easier, or should I say not as hard, to climb or descend. I am looking forward to continuing my hike more than ever.I am going to be posting at least a couple times a week now. I will add some more pics.","

Jaepaer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588618,"I will start this post with “ The Story of the Three Bears”. This happened back at Groundhog Shelter on The evening of April 21. As I laying in the shelter nearly asleep around 10 pm, a man came running up telling how there are three bears and they won’t go away. Now he was camping about .2 mile north of the shelter. It seems odd, but someone had taken a marker and in big letters written Bears on the shelter wall. Anyway, the man with the three bears encounter said that he gathered up everything he could and ran down to the the shelter I was staying in. He tried to scare off the Bears by banging loudly on his pans but to no avail. They just stood there looking at him. By this time they were around his tent so he had to abandon it. He did manage to take some pics. I can say that one of the bears was very large. 
I told him his tent was probably safe since it was still there before he left. If the bears had smelled any food in the tent, it would have been shredded very quickly by the bears so they could get at any food. So a fellow camper with his dog and the man, went back to retrieve his tent. Luckily, the tent was still unharmed and there were no bears in sight. He finished his story by saying “I wanted to see bears but not like this”. This story illustrates why you do not keep food or eat in your tent. Good for the hiker that he followed proper protocol!
Now to my hike update.
I have hiked around 70 miles since my last post. Although I am out of the Smokies, there is still a lot of hiking up long and steep mountains. Also, some steep decents; but, I had my best hiking days nevertheless. The mountains and forests, National Parks, rivers, streams, etc. provide breathtaking views. I am also hiking with GoJoe, which is compatible with my hiking speed- though he is a little faster. Joe is from near Providence, Massachusetts.
I experienced some trail magic at I-26 underpass the other morning. People teamed up from Asheville, NC, Johnson City, TN, and Damascus, VA. They provided a large variety of food, snacks, drinks, and even hot pancakes! They are wonderful, thoughtful and generous people to do this although it was a cold, windy morning. Thanks to all of them!
Got off the trail Monday at 2:15 and hitchhiked into Erwin, TN. Erwin was about 3.5 miles west to where I got off the trail. A man that owns a eatery and Hostel in Roan Mtn., TN gave us a ride. I will definitely visit the eatery when I get there, which is about a three day hike. Joe keeps being amazed at the Southern people and their hospitality, esp the Baptist Churches. He said they do not have anything like this in Massachusetts. Says the farther you get north, the more they look down on hikers. I guess I will see.
Going back to Erwin, Tim and Estil Woodward, from Scott co., TN and very good friends of mine, came down to spend some time together. They picked me up at Bojangles and we went To Johnson City, TN and stayed at a Holiday Inn Express last night and  also ate at Texas Roadhouse. 
Thanks for your support and coming to Erwin Tim and Estil!!
I will be taking off today, staying in Erwin tonight, then getting back on the trail tomorrow morning. I should be arriving in Damascus, VA on the evening of May 11th. In Damascus, they have what they call “Trail Days” from May 18-20. This is a celebration for all the current and past hikers. I have heard lots of good things about it so I plan on attending May 18-19. Although I will be north of there, I will be getting a shuttle or ride back to Damascus and then back to the trail afterward. I look forward to it! I may even get a haircut there since the warmer weather should be here to stay for awhile.

Jaepaer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589181,"I have hiked 51 miles since Erwin,TN. The breakdown: Wed 12.6m, Thurs 13.6m, Fri 17.8m, Sat 7m. Staying at the hostel “Station at 19E” in Roan Mtn, TN. The last 3.5 days have gone well, with Fri  being my longest mileage day yet. Had the pleasure to experience Trail Magic on three occasions. The first on Thursday. Although it was a rationed TM, it was still awesome. Had a glass of sweet tea, a brownie (which was very delicious), and a chair. Chairs to sit in is about as important as the food.The second was on Fri at Hughes Gap, which was provided by Casper. He will also be doing TM up the trail into VA n MA. I had a root beer and some snacks.The third TM was also on Fri. The day I have hiked the longest pertaining to mileage and hours (nearly 12 hrs). I may add that there were a lot of elevations along the way, including Roan Mtn. TM came at Carver’s Gap. I arrived there about 2 pm. The people doing the TM are from Bristol, TN. They provided hot dogs(not the cheap ones but more expensive ones) w/mustard n onion. Also, chips (I had Doritos) and drinks (coke). Let me tell you, it was awesomely good! I also had a banana. This food was like jet fuel. It propelled (up the mountains also) me to do the 17.8m w/lots of energy. It could not have come at a better time of day!

Jaepaer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589671,"GoJoe and I are taking a day off today, Wed., May 9. We hitch hiked into Elizabethton, TN Tues afternoon and are staying at Americourt motel. Let me tell you, it is not a very good place to stay but when one is hiking the AT, it suffices.The hike the past 3 days was good with the weather being excellent. Lots of sunshine with no rain except for a Saturday  night storm with a little light rain Sunday morning for just a few minutes. Saturday night I stayed at Station 19E hostel so that worked out well. I am now just approximately 41 miles from Damascus, VA. I should be reaching on Saturday. However, at this point I have hiked 428 miles which is 19.5% of the AT. Ten more miles and I will have hiked 20% of the AT.I will add photos as soon as I post this entry. Now on to the flopping hikers.First, I will define a few hiking terms. Flip-flopping is when a hiker hiked one direction, then goes up ahead and hikes the other direction. A normal example would be hiking S to N from Springer Mtn to Harpers Ferry. Harpers Ferry is considered the half way point of the AT. So, hiking S to N from SM to HF then going to Mt Katahdin (northern end of the AT) and then hiking back to HF to end one’s AT thru-hike.Slack packing is being dropped off at one point and picked up at another point while taking minimal gear. Usually done for a day at a time.Now there is nothing wrong with either of these by themselves. The issue is when S to N thru-hikers slackpack sections going N to S. They cherry pick the sections so they are going mostly downhill to avoid going up the mountains. There are many doing this. My question, and it is only a question, by doing so does it introduce impurities that infiltrate the Spirit  of what thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail is truly about? Thus, what I call “Flopping Slackers”. Any opinions??","

I am liking forward to our visit and attending Trail Days.One side note. We-GoJoe and I- stayed in Elizabethton this past Tues/Wed. We had hitched a ride from about 14 miles from the trail and was wondering how long it would take us to get a ride back to where we needed to get back on the trail. Thursday morning, we stepped out to the road, I held my thumb out and the first vehicle pulled over and gave us a ride! It was the owner of the Boots Off Hostel that was just .1 mile from where we were headed. This is the second ride we have gotten from the owners of a hostel.Getting ready to get back on the trail after spending the night in Damascus at “The Place”.

Jaepaer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591917,"I have hiked 70 miles since last post, of which includes Tuesday-Saturday. I hiked 4.8 miles into Pearisburg, VA today and will be back on the trail about 11 am tomorrow. 
All is going well except for Tuesday which has physically been my worst hiking day to date. I knew shortly into my hike that I was struggling. I believe I had not eaten enough calories or/and protein. I did manage to hike 14.5 miles and bounced back Wednesday and the following days. Of course, I am giving more attention to what and how much I eat throughout the day. Fortunately there were two grocery outlets that cooked food, which did help me recover. On Wednesday I had a cheeseburger w/Cajun fries and a few yoo-hoo chocolate drinks at Brushy Mtn grocery. This place was right off the trail. On Thursday, I had 2 BLT w/egg at Trent’s Grocery.  The food was great at both places. 
After eating at Brushy Mtn. on Wednesday, a fellow hiker (Blue Moon) and I hitch-hiked into Bland, VA and resupplied at Dollar General. 
While eating at Trent’s Grocery on Thursday, an 86 year young man and I talked for most of the time I was there. He said that his son-in-law owns the place and he was just hanging out there for awhile. This is the first year he is not going to put out a garden. I can tell you he looked a lot younger and was lean and healthy looking, though he has had a couple health issues recently. After I ate and we talked (1 1/2hr), he gave me a ride back to the trail. Very nice man!
A couple more things to mention. First, on my Friday hike, I hiked through many tunnels of Rhododendrons. It seemed that there were miles of them. I wish I knew. Second is about the birds. They start their chirping/singing at 5:30 in the morning. Let me tell you, they seem that they love to do it and proud of it. Now at 5:30, I do not see any daylight, but I would never doubt the birds. I have noticed that at lower elevations, there are more birds; thus, more joyful noise. On one particular morning, we (5 of us) were tenting in the middle of their gathering. There were so many birds and it was so loud, yet a great kind of loudness. So many varying souds but it all was perfectly orchestrated. It was if they were singing their Praises to God Himself. I believe they were. In the mist of all this, there was a woodpecker about 10 feet from my tent joining in. He started his business at 5:30 for a few seconds and then every 5 minutes after that he would repeat himself. He wad like an alarm clock with a snooze button and somehow, it all blended in with all the other sounds!
Enough for now. I have posted pics with some being from Damascus Trail Days from a week ago.

Jaepaer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592633,"So I decided to take a full day off the trail in Pearisburg on Sunday and resumed my hike at 11 am on Monday, Memorial Day. After 30 minutes into my hike, I came upon trail magic. They were serving drinks, hotdogs, chips, etc. I was not hungry for I had eaten breakfast a couple hours earlier, but I did indulge in a coke and a bag of cool ranch Doritos. I wish I would have ran into this about 7 or 8 miles up the trail. Nevertheless, it is always good to see trail magic!I hiked 14.2 m on Monday, with it raining for a couple hours. Tuesday I had my longest hiking day to date going 18.9m. The next 2 days I encountered 4 serious climbs. 2 on Wednesday and 2 on Thursday. These were very steep and long climbs. Now though I handle these kind of climbs better, they are still hard. With that, it has been very humid and within 2 hours of my hike, I am drenched in sweat. Sometimes I want it to rain so I would be saturated with rain water. I think it would feel better. Now it has rain a few times but mostly not where I was hiking. It is more isolated showers. Wednesday I ended at 15.1m and Thursday at 16.2 m. Today, June 1, I hiked 3.7 m. I have some pictures to share that I think are really nice. However, it is taking so long to down load them I will wait to do that Sunday or Monday. I will let all know when this has been done.So Today, I hiked into 4 Pines Hostel which is owned and ran by Joe and his wife. They are very hiker friendly and drove us to resupply and to eat. I will be spending the night here tonight. Also, I did get to take s shower and wash my clothes.On my hike today, I visited The Dragon’s Tooth. The pics will speak for themselves but it is very nice.

A lot of hikers at the site with tent site just a few yards down the hill. Also, about 10-12 Boy Scouts stayed also.The highlight of the past few days were Mcafee Knob and Tinker Cliffs. As Jeff mentioned in a message, Mcafee Knob is the most photographed site in the Appalachian Trail. But I think this has to do with its accessibility compared to other sites. It is a 3.7 mile hike from a big parking lot, which allows people from all over to visit it. I would guess that I saw 50 “non-hikers” going to, comping down or on the knob. But make no mistake, it is a beautiful place.Tinker Cliffs is about 5 miles north of Mcafee Knob. It has boulders that protrude out but maybe not as far. They also do not have the area that Mcafee has. There are also around 15-18 areas at Tinker Cliffs to view from along a stretch of maybe one mile.One other mention, there was another trail magic at the parking lot leading up to Mcafee Knob. A local man had water for hikers which came in handy because there were many miles between water sources. Great place to do Trail Magic with water!!I have included many pics, enjoy","Springer Mountain

Jaepaer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593439,"I have hiked 46.9m Tues-Thurs. Tues was 14, Wed 18 and Thurs 14.9. The weather has been great and could not be better. Sunny but not hot and with low humidity. Thursday’s Hike was particularly tough with all the ups. I stayed at Bryant Shelter which I consider has been the best yet. Very well built with two decks and lots of space. I am feeling good but am tired at the end of the day. This is good because I do sure sleep well. Also, Thursday there was Trail Magic in which one of the thru-hikers’ wife provided. It included cheese, sausage, crackers, beer, etc. It was very good as is all the Trail Magic food and drink has been. I have included a picture of this. I am sitting in Scott’s restaurant in Glasgow eating while I am writing this blog. I came off the trail into town to eat and re-supply. I will be going back on the trail to hike a couple more hours today. In the parking lot before I came into town, I helped a guy from Blacksburg set up his Trail Magic. He section hikes and his trail name is Senator. Very nice guy and I will be partaking of the Trail Magic in a few hours. He is doing hot dogs, etc. I did drink a coke before coming into town.All for now. Thanks for following! Please sign guest book!","Springer Mountain

First, I would like to shortly review the  the Appalachian Trail for 2018. The AT travels through 14 states, from Georgia to Maine. The distance can vary year to year and most of the time it does. It certainly changes and has over the years. Actually, there is “hiker talk” that the Appalachian Trail Conservancy is considering starting the trail at Amicalola Falls State Park (this is where I started) next year. As of now, it is an approach trail to Springer Mtn, the southern beginning of the AT. It is 8.8miles. For 2018, the AT distance is 2190.7 miles. Counting the approach trail, I will hike 2199.5 miles, if and when I make it to the top of Mount Katahdin in Maine.
Now, on to my update on my hike.
The weather the past week has been versatile, including thunderstorms, a cold rain all day and night on Monday, cool weather but warming up on my last hiking day, and some sun. Which brings me to a story. A couple weeks or so ago, a man from Pearisburg, VA was doing a section hike when he was caught in a thunderstorm. As he was hiking, according to another hiker near by, a bolt of lightning hit very near to him. Though he was ok, he stuck his trekking poles in the ground and headed back to Pearisburg, abandoning his hike and his poles. I remember passing those. Anyway, a female section hiker which had no trekking poles ended up with them and so happened to me at a shelter I stayed at a few nights ago. She said she would return them if he wanted them back. I don’t think he will be looking for them.
About a week ago, as I was hiking in the morning, I came upon a group of women standing around just beyond a shelter. They were getting ready to start their hike for the day. I spoke to them and like always, asked their trail names and where they were from. They said they were from Louisville and the surrounding area. One of them, Paula Jones, said she was from Scottsburg, IN. Not only that, she teaches at Covenant Christian Academy in Austin! Wow, what a small world. Paula graduated from Scottsburg in 1988. 
I have several Trail Magic encounters to convey. I will start with the one in the parking lot just after I walked across the James River on a foot bridge. As I was waiting on a pre-arranged ride into Glasgow to eat and re-supply, a man pulls into the parking lot in a truck. He got out and introduced himself- trail name Senator-and that he was going to set up to do Trail Magic for the first time. He asked me to help him set up his canopy so I obliged. Got a coke and rode into town. Came back a few hours later and ate grilled hotdogs and snacks and a something to drink. He also had hamburgers. He even had chairs for the hikers. It was a very good place to set up for there were a lot of hikers. You will see a pic of him in photos.
Last Saturday I hiked 18.3 miles, making it to a shelter at 5:30 with 5 minutes to spare before a thunderstorm. The storm lasted about 30 minutes and with 3 hours left before dark, I could have hiked another 1.7 miles to a road and gotten a ride into Buenta Vista. This would have been my first 20 mile day. Nevertheless, I stayed at the shelter and was a little put off with myself that I didn’t continue on after the storm. I got to the road early the next morning. There was another thru-hiker-Slacker from New Jersey-trying to get a ride when I arrived. I was there 4 minutes when the second vehicle picked us up. It was an older couple that had some time on their hands on a Sunday morning. They took us to the campground in Buenta Vista (9.4 miles) to take a shower. The showers were very clean and had hot water! Then, they took us for breakfast to Lexington, which is a few miles on the other side of Buenta Vista. Lexington is a very historic town. George Washington and Lee College is there, along with VMI, Virginia Military Institute. After that, that took us to Food Lion and Dollar General to re-supply. Then they took us back to the trail so we could continue our hike. All this took 3 hours. What a kind-hearted and generous couple! I could kick myself for not getting a picture of them.
So after they dropped us off back at the trailhead, I continued my hike to Grassy Meadows which is just beyond a gap and road with a parking lot. There, under a tree was Trail Magic. The Mother of a thru-hiker came from Michigan to see her daughter and do Trail Magic. Had hotdogs, lunch meat, snacks, drinks, etc despite a thunderstorm just a little bit earlier. You will see the pic in photos. Virginia has been very good to me!
The last few days I have hiked with 3 hikers. Nick from Upstate New York, Two Step from Evansville, IN and Wondering Bill from Cincinnati, OH. You will see our pic in photos. Nick and Two Step are thru-hiking. WBill was section hiking. He and 2 of his friends hike 100-150 miles every year. The other two had to drop out during this year’s section hike do WBill finished without them- 150 miles. WBill is in his 70s I suspect but what a hiker! He is better than me. He and his 2 Friends thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail in 2006. I also think he said there were another who did also. The two that began this year’s section hike are Mad Dog and Pilgrim.
WBill is easy going, likable and very easy to talk with. After we-the four of us-got a ride into Waynesboro Thursday, he and I had lunch at a Chinese Buffet. The restaurant was very clean, service good, food great, and what a variety of food! I was very much impressed with it all. The cost was $8.50 plus a drink if you got one. What a bargain. Anyway, WBill was done with his section hike when we got to Waynesboro. After lunch, we went to Stanimals and he took a shower and got a ride to the next town to catch a bus at 10pm. I will certainly miss hiking with WBill. I gave him my direct link to my blog and he said he would follow me. He said he has never followed anyone before. I hope he does.
In Waynesboro there is a list of Trail Angels that will give hikers a ride anywhere in town. Wow, a town with a list of Trail Angels! Awesome! I got rides from them several times. Thank you Trail Angels!
So I stayed at Stanimals hostel Thursday and Friday nights. I took a zero day on Friday. It is owned and operated by Adam. He also gives free rides around town, free laundry, and let me say it is by far the best hostel I have stayed in! Very clean, great beds, tv/media room Netflix and computers, snacks and drinks one can purchase, and he runs it on the Honor System. I am glad I stayed there. 
Enough for now.

Saturday was a beautiful hiking day, with abundant sunshine and low humidity. Got started about 11 and hiked 12.2 miles. Sunday had a little light rain in the morning but not enough to get wet. I took a lunch break at a picnic area then headed back down the trail. I stopped a few yards in and took my backpack off to see if I had left something behind. I had everything do as I was putting my backpack on, a day hiker passed by. I continued my hike with him 50’ in front and then he started slowly backing up. At this point, I knew why. Now I have never seen a bear this entire thru-hike or the hikes I took before my thru-hike over the years. But today was different. Within the first 2 or 3 minutes, about 25 yards in front of us this massive bear crossed the trail. This has to be the largest bear on the trail (see photos). After he crossed the trail about 5 yards, there was no way I was going by him being that close to the trail. Then an adolescent bear joined him. Eventually, the bear moved on after the adolescent bear saw me and ran off down the mountain. 
Monday morning about 7:30 as I was hiking, in tall weeds just off the trail I startled a smaller ( maybe the mother, not sure) bear and a cub that ran partly up a tree a few yards from the trail (see photos). In photos you can see the cub on the back side of tree, especially if you expand the picture. Do this also with the pictures pertaining to the previous bear encounter mentioned. So four bears in two days, not bad. 
Monday was very sunny but very humid. Got a ride into Elkton, VA and ate at McDonald’s. Then got another ride to Country View Motel and stayed there for the night. Took a much needed shower and washed my clothes. 
Tuesday, got re-connected with Nick, Two Step and Molasses. Only hiked 8.3 miles into Lewis Mountain Campground and stayed in a four-bunk small cabin. A good rain started at 5 and lasted about an hour which then turned into a beautiful evening. 
Wed I hiked 15.8miles. We stopped at Big Meadows and ate lunch and re-supplied. Was there over 3 hours and then started hiking again after the thunderstorm passed. Hiked another 8 miles through two thunderstorms. Tented about one mile south of Skyland Resort and Restaurant. 
I am in Shannandoah National Park which has a lot of places to eat and re-supply. It is about 105 miles of the AT. It sure helps on a lighter pack because of not needing to carry as much food. There is always a place to eat almost everyday.

and I am now in Boiling Springs Pennsylvania, having hiked 57 miles thus far in this state. 
My brother Jeff and sister Karen came to Winchester, VA to visit. Jeff hiked with me for 2 days as Karen provided logistics. We also stayed in Harper’s Ferry West VA. Thank you both for your support! We had a lot of fun and it was great to see both of them.
Also, my Mother, Sister Denise and Aunt Rowena brought me back to the trail today from Tennessee. Thank you all three! We stayed in Gettysburg the last 2 nights while visiting the Civil War battlefields in Gettysburg yesterday. Unimaginable what happened there with all the bloodshed and suffering. 
If you haven’t been there, I highly recommend visiting.
I took the last 7 days off to attend my Family Reunion in Tennessee on Friday and Saturday, July 6-7, and to take a break. The Reunion was great as was the break. I am getting ready to get back on the trail today, Wednesday, July 11.
Up to Boiling Springs, my hike has been going very well. I am looking forward to “finding my groove” once I get re-started and hope it doesn’t take long. However, I will ease back into it. 
I have added many pictures. One is of my Nephew with his back to the camera overlooking a bluff in Tennessee. Another is of his younger brother who decided to put my backpack on that I had set outside. Plus, there are many more pictures.

Jaepaer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599376,"I have hiked 154 miles since last post. Finished Pennsylvania, then New Jersey and am now in New York with about 32 miles before Connecticut. 
I am glad I made it through Pennsylvania when I did because of all the rain they have recently gotten. In fact, I met 3 women that said they were hiking in knee high water so they decided to skip ahead north to NY and hike south to Pennsylvania where they got off the trail. I saw where the town of Pine Grove got flooded. A town that hitch hiked into about 2 weeks ago to have lunch. 
You will see pics and the one with me beside a U.S. Flag is atop a mountain just inside the NY border. I have seen several U.S. flags in NY, some in NJ, and many many in Pennsylvania.   
There are a lot of very small towns close to the AT trail. Towns I enjoy stopping in to get recharged through food, but especially to talk with townspeople to learn more if the towns. This is one of the most enjoyable parts of my hike. 
There is still Trail Magic happening. Some examples are that one guy picked me up and took me into town and asked me where I was staying. I told him I was going back to the trail after I ate and re-supplied. So he gave me his phone # and I called him after I was ready to go back to the trail and he picked me up and took me. Wow! Another was when I was sitting at a picnic table at Bellvale Creamery and a young man, about 20, asked me -while he was standing in line- if I was thru hiking and things about it. Then he asked me if I wanted an ice cream and of course I said sure. He brought me a large ice cream on a waffle cone w/four different ice creams on it. It was sooooo good! Another Trail Magic moment was when I was hitch hiking in NY and this van that was going the other direction pulled off to the side of the road. After sitting there 5 minutes, he turned around and picked me up. He said-he is s Jewish man- he was going the wrong way and was looking at his map to see which way he should go. Then he said that maybe God had sent him the “wrong way” do he could give me a ride. Wow! There are a lot of Jewish people in NY.
Steve and Carrie Peacock picked me up just outside of Peekskill, NY on Wednesday evening, Aug 1. We spent 2 nights in Peekskill. On Thursday we went to West Point, which was just a few miles away. You will see some pics from West Point. Then, we got on a train for an hour ride into New York City. The train took us to Grand Central Station. We spent several hours in NY City. What a city! While there we visited Trump Tower. Just outside the front doors were 2 guards with machine guns. Once inside, they scanned any and all bags, but not the peoples. It was very elaborate inside. You will see pics. I had a great time w/ Steve and Carrie and it was so good to see them, to spend time w/them and for all their support!

Jaepaer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599901,"I am sending this to let all that are following know, after 1400+ miles of hiking, I have incurred an injury. It is nothing serious but enough of one, that I believe forces me off the trail at this time. The injury is either a shin splint or a stress fracture. More likely then not, it is probably a shin splint. This is nothing unusual as one hikes and piles up the miles.  Especially an older individual, although it happens to much younger individuals as well. I incurred this on Sunday afternoon on July 29th. Nothing in particular happened other then my lower right leg started bothering me. This past week I only hiked 28 miles while attempting to give my leg rest. I have been hiking between 90-99 miles per week. However, my leg has gotten a little bit worst. I can tell you that it is not really bad, but bad enough to hinder my hiking to the point that I am not able to hike the usual daily miles. 
My plan at this point is to go home, rest, treat and do stretching exercises to get myself back to being able to hiking. I will take 2 weeks off and then test my leg by hiking a couple days before I go back to the trail, which I am hoping to do! We will see.
