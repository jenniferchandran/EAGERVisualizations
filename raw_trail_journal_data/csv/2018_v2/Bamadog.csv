It was hot and humid all day and the black flies were attacking.I was going to go farther than I did until I heard it thundering in the distance. It was just before Stratton Pond shelter so it made my decision easy.
Thank you Lord for answered prayer. The bottom fell out 2 minutes after I got to the shelter.Great shelter.Met Leuko there.Had met him earlier. His feet are a mess.Lot of leukotape tape on them.Also the Jetsons showed up just before dark.Some other great people were there. It rained a lot off and on thru the night.There were a lot of downed trees and limbs across the trail this morning. I came to Manchester Center today because my sweetheart had new shoes sent here to the hostel. These should get me home. I wanted good traction going where I am heading. Met Styx and Buddy and Super English here at the hostel. Going to go and eat my rotisserie chicken I bought at the grocery store along with the bag of oranges.Already ate my ice cream!

I'm usually in a valley at the end of the day with not enough signal to do anything. It is raining. I am dry in my tent.I got soaked to the bone yesterday. It rained steady for 4 hours 
I did my first all day slack pack yesterday. Did 23.7 miles. It was a long day. I was freezing cold for a little while before the rain finally subsided.It was around 60 degrees. Thanks to Fancy Free and her husband Jim for that and letting me stay at their house. Thanks to Sagebrush for taking me into Manchester Center a few days ago.Thanks to Steve Prettyman and his daughter for the wonderful trail magic a few days ago.That helped me climb Stratton Mountain on a warm muggy day.Camped beside Little Rock pond shelter on Wednesday. Beautiful place. Thursday I camped beside the Governor Clement shelter. Saw 14 naked hikers.They come from somewhere out of state and do a 10 mile hike every year. I did not participate. Friday I climbed Mt Killington. Had less than 500 miles to go at the end of that day.Saturday I slack packed to Hiway 12  and slept in a guy's barn loft.He had 3 queen size mattresses on box springs.It was good after coming in out of the rain.Laid in bed late this morning. It is so good to do that occasionally. Got going after 9 this morning. The forest has been beautiful in Vermont. Had a relatively short day today. I have a package coming to Hanover but it is scheduled to be there on Wednesday.
