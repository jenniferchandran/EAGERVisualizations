Crosstitch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578869,"First day of our guided REI backpacking trip in the Great Smoky Mountains. Yesterday Perry and I drove rental car 10 hours to Gatlinburg, Tn. Perry and I met our Guides in the Lobby of the Court Yard Marriott.. Bethany (28)  grew up hiking in the Smokies with her family and did an AT thru hike in 2014. Laura ( 23) lots of backpacking experience. Very knowledgeable about the ""Flora and Fauna "" in the Smokies. Met other 2 backpackers - Carrie ( 40 something and Lisa ( 58) Really nice gals. Guides did a "" shake down"" of our packs and taught us how to pack them correctly. I think with food and H2) mine is somewhere between 30 - 35 lbs. We got a lift from a 3rd REI person to Newfound Gap trail head where we were shown how to put on and adjust packs. Just this first part was invaluable information. We then headed out - Bethany in lead me next - this is the lst time and last time I would be  first in line - Lisa and Carrie were way faster than me! We hiked to Sweat Heifer Trail past Sweat Heifer Cascades to Kepart Shelter. Approx. 5.4 miles. Learned how to poop and pee in the woods! We had our dehydrated camp meals. Hung our packs on bear cables. Lights out by ""camper midnight"" (9 pm).",,Kephart Shelter,"Sep 17, Sun",5.40
Crosstitch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578860,"Day 2 of our REI guided trip in the Smoky Mountains. Guides ""made "" us breakfast which was them using jet boils to boil H2O to add to our dehydrated backpacking food. Took off by 9am - took N. Grassy Branch trail for 2.5 miles - terrain was difficult with 1000 feet elevation change in 2.5 mile ( straight up!) I was sucking air. Then went E on Dry Sluice trail for about 2.9 miles. Then took Cabin Flats trail to Camp Site 49 for a total of 6.5 miles. Continue to be really surprised at how long it takes me to do this mileage. We would hike for about 1 - 1 1/2 hours - stop for ""potty "" breaks, snacks, some stretching and a breather. Camp Site 49 really nice spot. We pitched tents here - LOVE my tent! Super easy set up. Really liked ability tent gives you to have your own little sanctuary away from everyone. I liked spreading out my stuff. Had dinner - dehydrated camp food. Learned about digging a ""cat hole"".  We hiked just a bit to see beaver damns. ""Lights out"" early. Nice creek beside us with soothing water sounds. Slept better than first night.",,Camp Site 49 The Great Smoky Moutains,"Sep 18, Mon",6.50
Crosstitch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578863,Day 3 of REI guided trip. Went approx .8 miles on Cabin Flats trail to Bradley Fork Trail - 3.3 Miles here. Perry and guide Laura parted ways with us before Bradley Fork. Perry's knee is not holding up well. . Took Hughes Trail about 1.8 Miles to Pecks Corner Shelter. 2 guys there already who were section hiking. 3 more thru hikers showed up - they are doing a flip flop - same route that I will do! They were very encouraging. Said great way to go for many reasons. Gals were - Slice and Luna (?). The guys name - ? Then 1 more thru hiker came. The 2 guy thru hikers did tents. The rest of us took the Shelter. Filtered H2O ( tried my steri pen - few false starts then worked ok. Dinner and lights out. Noisy nite. Restless hiker and snoring hiker. Note to self - bring ear plugs! Mouse running around. It spent some of the night between me and Lisa! Had a  privy here -yeah!,,Pecks Corner Shelter Smoky Mountains,"Sep 19, Tue",5.90
Crosstitch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578870,"Got a little earlier start in the am. Have learned so much. Biggest surprise is how much longer the miles are taking than I anticipated. Bethany said 1 trail mile = 3 ""city "" miles! From Peck's Corner we took Hughs Ridge Trail 1/2 mile to the AT. Then the AT 6 miles to ""Charlie's Bunion"". Laura caught back up with us here. Had lunch and back to Newfoundland Gap - on the AT another 4 miles. Last 4 miles downhill (yeah!) but hard on knees. Difficult terrain. All I could think about was pizza and wine at Mike's house ( my son who lives in Farragut - right outside Knoxville). Van took some weary but happy hikers back to the Marriott for a ""debrief"" then we were off to Mike , Yvette and Hunter's house. Great, great 4 days. Learned so much. Guides were great. Can't believe Bethany is doing an Ironman on Sunday! Yikes! Perry and I will drive 10 hour to Fl. tomorrow ( Thursday) then we have an all weekend Dragon Boat clinic! I can't wait to sleep!",,Newfound Gap Trail Head,"Sep 20, Wed",10.50
Crosstitch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582335,Met Dedes friends - Fran & Trina. Dede's Ron drove us to trail head. Pretty much a flat trail -yeah! Beautiful day - 70's. Hiked to Alexander Springs rec area. I got lost - didn't see side trail to campsite . Called Perry who was meeting us in Camp. I probably hiked 2 more miles than I had too! :) Nice ranger came and picked me up at the trail road intersection. Got in Camp in just enough time to set up tent before the sun went down. Beautiful night! To bed very early!,,Alexander Rec area,"Jan 23, Tue",10
Crosstitch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582383,"Another beautiful day. Started out cold ( 48 degrees) damp from dew. Perry joined us last night. Both Perry and I heard animals outside our tents last night. Footprints around Perry’s tent. She and I hiked out ahead most of the day. Terrain flat with some gradual uphill. Stopped and waited for rest of group before heading to Camp site. Great site with privey and pump water source. Set up tent, Ate dinner, hung bear bags - retired to tents at dark. Going to be another chilly night!",,Stealth camp,"Jan 24, Wed",8.50
Crosstitch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582418,Woke very early - found way in dark to privey. Very windy & chilly. Temps 50’s winds at 9ish mph. Perry and I started out around 9 Am. I got out ahead and got into Camp first around 1:30 pm. Everyone wandered in eventually. Nice campsight. Set up tents. Ate dinner. Fran taught me how to throw a bear bag. Lights out early ( I mean like 7p!) Good Day!,,Juniper Springs Campground,"Jan 25, Thu",9.60
Crosstitch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582444,"Solo hike today! A guy - Rick(?) from another Camp site stopped by to talk to us - he had done the AT twice. The gals are all dealing with blisters and sore places from backpacks. They have decided to get up leisurely and explore our campground and eat some hot food at the campground store. I decided I would carry on and do the plan for day 4 as originally mapped out in order to get more practice. Dede very generously lent me her phone with the Guthook app of the trail. This was so useful!  This section of the trail was very poorly marked and the GPS was very helpful. I left around 8:30 AM and booked it as much is I could taking only two short five minute breaks.  The trail was typical of the last three days changing scenery fairly frequently. There were a couple of “dicey” crossings involving a couple of feet of water with a few logs thrown over. I saw a beautiful doe cross the trail.  I got to Yearling Trail at about 12:15 PM. The Yearling Trail  was a bit longer than I had anticipated! The GPS sort of pooped out for a while but eventually I got to the parking lot where Dede’s friend Ron was picking us up.  He had picked up the girls earlier at Juniper Springs and brought them to the Yearling Trail where they hiked a couple of miles to see the huge sinkhole that is a iconic site there. We all met up in the parking lot around 130. Ron and five very dirty, very tired hikers drove back to the Villages. Perry’s husband met us at Dede’s and drove us home. That shower was the best ever!!!! Then Ron took me out for a huge Veggie omlet and back home to prop up sore feet, watch TV and just veg! I am so Grateful for all the things that Dede, Fran and Trina helped me with and taught me along the way. I know all these things will all help on the Appalachian Trail.",,Yearling Trail / RT 19,"Jan 26, Fri",9.50

Perry stretched us out and warmed us up then  Alison, Indi, Mary K., Susan Mc. , Susan P. , Jody, Nancy F. , Miriam, Karen C.  and I headed out. We didn’t get too far out until we came across wonderful “ trail magic”  as Paula was waiting for us with her golf cart start all kinds of drinks and snacks for us. What a trail angel! Paula followed our journey the entire way providing anything we needed including moral support. My personal favorite was the Girl Scout cookies! We stopped at Saddlebrook for a potty stop then on to Sumter Landing. We made to Panera before breakfast was done so we grabbed an outside table where Paula joined us to “ fill our tanks”. Then we were off to our next stop “Seabreeze “. Several gals stopped at Sumter and one at Seabreeze. We then crossed 466 A and proceeded to Brownwood where we finished up. These gals rocked out 14+ Miles! Wish they were all coming on the AT with me - good conversation made the miles whiz by! Thx Sisters!!!!!!!!",,Brownwood Town Square The Villages,"Mar 06, Tue",0

We did have a little meeting but then it turned into a totally awesome “ AT send off “ party for me! This team is the best! There were balloons, presents and food! I was blown away. There were so many thoughtful gifts from camping toilet paper to a switchblade!!! Between $$ and gift cards my unbelievable teammates gave me over $500 to spend on resupples and places to stay on my journey. I am overwhelmed! As I told them - each and every one of them has inspired me in some way. I will carry each of them in my heart on this journey.

Sandra “faced timed” the entire Dragon boat team - both sessions! Ron and I took off a little before 11am. We stopped to say a tearful goodbye to Dad and Ann. We got to the Deland Train Station pretty early so we found a Subway for lunch. The Deland Train Station is very small but folks were very pleasant. Another tearful goodbye to Ron. We had such a nice week together before my departure date. My seat mate on the train is very nice personable guy and good conversation helped the time go by. However it is Friday the 13th - in the first 1/2 hour a guy had a cardiac event and EMS had to meet us at the first stop. Then after we crossed into Ga. we hit a car and the driver was killed. OMG -you can’t make this stuff up! So sad. We were stuck for over 4 hours- 3 of those  we had no power, air conditioning or bathrooms because of engine damage. After 10 pm and we finally after switching engines were in our way! What a way to start. I hope the trip is uneventful after this! Stay tuned!",,Washington DC then Harper’s Ferry,"Apr 13, Fri",0

Trail like a rock stream bed - flowing water the entire way. Went 5 miles and stopped at Rocky run shelter -was going to just to eat lunch then go 7.5 more but this shelter was so nice  - decided to just stay! Hikezilla stayed also. Hikers from last night -Johnny Walker, Bangles and couple = M&M hiked on to next Shelter. We were at the shelter early - but nice to rest  and just hang out AND try to get warm and dry. Another hiker -section hiker -Alex came in - nice young kid hiking for 2 months b4 going to Med school. Enjoying an short day.

Pretty cashed at the end of the day tho! First little fall but I bounced well.  Did however take my first ibphrofen. Stayed at a shelter that was .3 miles down a very steep incline. Legs not liking that at the end of 10 Miles! Worst part is we will have to go up it to even get to the trail in the am!

We had a great breakfast  then ran into several other hikers.  Best sister in the world Caroll and brother-in-law Donn  met Hikezilla and I there, took us  into Gettysburg where we each got a room. Carol and Don took our dirty stuff to a laundry mat and then took us to Walmart to  resupply. Best sister and brother-in-law ever! I have the best shower of my life!

We had met him before - retired firefighter 60’s (like me!) I was hoping we would run into him cause Hikezilla is out of here on Friday am and I don’t want to be on my own!

One gradual up and one sort of short rock scramble. Got to Shelter before 3p. Nice shelter with 4 platform type bunks. Supposed to rain tonight so this is a good set up. Water about 1/4 mile down hill. Hikezilla made a rice side and I dumped my tuna packet in and we shared. Started sprinkling 5:30ish -so we are in 4 the night!

Best part of the day was after about 1 1/2 miles stopped at small deli for a wonderful breakfast with Hikezilla and Firetrekker . Took a bit of a spill in a creek :) bruised leg but bounced well. Firetrekker is much faster so he hiked ahead. Did this part called Rock Maze. Stupid me - I was thinking - cool - we will weave in and out of rocks - oh no it was a major boulder climb. There were some taller than me! Twice Hikezilla had to shove me up and over - I honestly don’t know how I would have done it on my own! It then rained for about the last 2 Miles of the day.  We met up at the campground ( I use that term loosely ) with Firetrekker who had gotten here way earlier than us got to set up before the rain.

It was a long day -14.5 miles but mostly flat except for the last 2 Miles which was a big uphill 500 ft elevation change. We first hiked into Boiling Springs and had an amazing breakfast at Cafe 101. It was a beautiful sunny day in the 60’s. Lots of wildflowers blooming. Forget-me-nots, buttercups, May apples, wild strawberries. Got into the shelter around 4:30.

Got an early start today ( wanted to give myself extra time cause I am so slow!) Hikezilla is done today with his section so had to say goodbye. Drizzled and foggy all am although I did see 2 beautiful deer. First part of day not too bad   Although very rocky. The last part was a killer down this steep mountain side with huge stones. These little legs had to work over time. Then into Duncannon, Pa. to the Doyle Hotel. I guess this is a famous stop over for hikers. OMG - I think it was built in the 1700 and never updated.... or cleaned! What an experience! I will stay here over night - do laundry and resupply stay Saturday night and hike out Sunday. Firetrekker is here but his daughter is picking him up to take him home to change out his gear. His backpack is huge and he wants to redo his entire system. He plans on starting back from this spot next week. He will probably catch me cause I am way slow! Well at least I am warm and dry for 2 nights!","

Crosstitch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588300,Day 14 - a zero day! So nice to not hike today! This hotel is beyond description. I have never stayed in anything like it! However I was warm and dry today.  Firetrekker and I went across the street for an awesome hot breakfast. Firetrekker’s daughter drove from Cleveland to get him so he can redo his gear. He says he will be back next week. It would be so hard to go home and come back out. Kudos to him. He was nice enough to give me a  stuff sack for my tent So now I am able to put my tent on the outside of my backpack which should give me a lot more room inside. It was sad to say goodbye. I was able to do laundry ( badly needed!) I have not been in a laundry mat since I was in my 20’s!  There is a local grocery store which sends a van  to the hotel every day at 4 PM so that hikers can get a ride to the grocery store and resupply. That was a great convenience. Two other hikers have shown up -one is named Dudley as in Dudley- do -right and the other one does not have a trail name yet -he is from Miami.  Both  gentlemen seem to be around my age. They  started from Harpers Ferry a day or so after me -so it seems we’re hiking around the same pace. They will both stay here an extra day or so but will probably catch up to me - as I continue to go pretty slow!  I went down the street to a local pub for dinner – that was an experience!  This is truly a real “Appalachian “ type town! I plan to get up early so I can  get an early start to the day -which should be about 11 miles. So again – lights out early!,"

Crosstitch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588383,Day 15. I thought it was going to be warmer today. Not! So cold again. Hiked from Duncannon to Peters Mt. Shelter. One hard part up a mountain - with tons of rocks. Had to sit and slide down some on my butt. Others I used hands and crawled up. It got easier after that. As much as I have been nervous about being alone at night I was sorta hoping to have the shelter to myself but there are 5 guys here :). One of the guys here I had met at the Doyle - “ Dudley”. Another couple ( guy and gal ) just showed up. The pitched a tent - hope it doesn’t blow away!  It is so cold and windy. Hope it’s warmer in the am! Lights out!,"

Cold and windy. Guy here named “ Dudley” who I met at the Doyle. He is also retired. He was a Boy Scout leader. We hiked out together - really cold and windy. We were headed to a campsite 13 Miles away but stopped at 10 at a nice camp site.  It was soooo windy that setting up a tent was a challenge. Dudley set up his hammock for the first time. Lights out early. All was peaceful until about 3:30 am when we heard a big screech and some thumping very close to our sleeping quarters. We think it might have been a bobcat. Didn’t sleep to well after that. I think I could hear something walking around. Yikes!","Peters Mountain Shelter

Crosstitch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588809,Good day cause shorter mileage!!!! Rausch Gap is a nice shelter about .2 mile off the AT. Gil already here when Dudley and I got in. Nice young personable hiker “LC “ or “ Learnimg Curve”  here also. Decided to sleep in shelter just make the morning go a little bit faster. Wonderful to have a piped water source  right at the shelter – sure makes things easier. Actually nice and warm for once.  After we had been there several hours another hiker came in – younger guy ( 30’s or 49’s$ from Germany named Konan ( sp?) The guy was rocksolid obviously in really good shape. When we ask him how many miles he had done – he answered 29! Wow!  He said - “  you have to understand that I am an ultra marathon runner.”  Still – impressive!  Then he proceeded to tell us that he was going back to Germany in three weeks  ( visa requirements) and he  would be able to see his wife and  oh by the way -while he was there  he would run in a 46 mile marathon that he does every year. Then he would come back and get back on the trail. Dang -this guy is a machine.  I was exhausted just listening to him!  Next to young college age girl came in – she had been hiking with Konan And had also done 29 miles that day! Holy crap! After this several other people hiked in -  One group had about three people – they were monks -  dressed in long sack cloth type robes. They were bald and used a single walking stick. Interesting! Someone said they were hiking to Washington DC – not sure for what. Very interesting conversation that night – eclectic group of people!,"Camp site

Dudley was up and out early. He has a 13.4 mile day today before getting off the AT at The Rock and Sole Hostel. Gil and I hiked out on 2 miles of probably the easiest 2 miles on the AT so far. The AT crosses Pa. 645 at a parking lot. We met the Calvary ( Ron ) there! It was the best! It was so great to see him there. He brought us donuts, muffins, bananas and Oj! He also brought “ trail magic” to leave in the trail for other hikers. What a guy! We drove to Cracker Barrel in Fogelsville where Gil treated  us to breakfast. Ron dropped me off at the Comfort Inn where I had the best shower EVER! He drove Gil to the airport where he was flying back to Miami.

I started this journey wanting to be a badass - now I sorta feel like a dumbass!!! The only reason I feel a little like a dumbass is because I told everyone I was doing the entire trail and would be gone 6 months. I totally expected and planned to do 6 months - but then only did 18 days!  One of the many books I had read about the AT encouraged you to state your intention to do the entire trail to everyone - that way you would be more committed - in retrospect - I should not have followed that advice! I have to say tho in my head I did intend to do the entire trail. For 2 years I researched and bought gear. I tweaked and re tweaked. I read book after book. I watched hours of utubes. I practiced, practiced, practiced. I went on 2 - 4 day backpacking trips - one was an REI guided trip in the Smokey’s. One was in the Ocala Forest. I have to say - the trail was everything I expected. What I didn’t expect is how I would feel out there! I didn’t think I would feel like I had to put in 10 - 14 mile days day after day in order to make enough progress ( and get to a place that made sense for the night). That was miles over REALLY challenging terrain. I didn't expect to miss Ron so much! I didn’t expect to be sleeping outside in 20 & 30 degree nights. It was so frickin cold those first 2 weeks! I had thought I would meet up with a female hiking buddy my age and speed. That did not happen. Although -as they sat out there “ the trail provides “ I did find several amazing hiking buddies. First was “ Hikezilla “ a section hiker -retired fellow Floridian who had done some of the AT in 2006. He taught me so much and hung with me the entire first 2 weeks. I would not have lasted that long if it weren’t for him! We also hiked with a super nice retired firefighter “ Firetrekker “ who was also green like me. He went home to redo his gear but is back on the trail and no doubt will finish. After that I met up with 2 other retired guys - “ Dudley” who hung with me for several days and Gil - also a Florida guy. All helped me immensely. 
I have never been one to live by “ what if’s”. So I am focusing on what I did learn - which was a ton in 2 1/2 weeks!  
I was able to accomplish many personal goals: 
 Think and plan more for myself and not just follow the guy in front of me. 
 Navigate my own way. I learned to be better at reading the trail map- to consider elevation changes,directions, how to find the next water source and the next shelter. I learned to factor check and factor in the weather. I learned how to get off into town, find laundry and resupply food. All these skills are a bit intimidating for me - my confidence level regarding doing these things has improved. 
 Pay attention to the weather - not just the prediction but also by “ feel”
 Really pay attention to my surroundings. Be more aware. Aware for terrain and critters. Aware to direction of where I got off and which way to continue in the correct direction.
 Physically I did things that I did not know I was capable of. I climbed big mountains going up steep grades. I negotiated big rock & boulder scrambles without falling ( too much!) I forded fast running waist high water in 50 degree weather . All these things while carrying 30 pounds on my back. I set my tent up in the pouring rain. I slept in 20 & 30 degree weather. Heck - I hiked over 160 miles in 18 days with only 1 day off!!!!!
I only was really scared once during those 18 days. Day 17 -Dudley and I were camping in the small campsite in Pennsylvania. Dudley was in his hammock and I was in my tent. Around 3 AM there was a loud thumping and a really loud screech of what sounded like a very large animal right outside my tent! Dudley looked out and shone his flashlight ( I was too scared to!) he could not see anything but we continued to hear something walking around. We think it may have been a bobcat - yikes! I did not sleep for the rest of that night!
I learned so many valuable lessons there out there.
I learned when you come up on a mountain or rock scramble ( whatever that may be for you) size it up, pick your best course, don’t overthink it, just put your head down and do it – one step at a time. Just keep moving forward until you get where you are going. 
There is a profound saying on the trail “ Hike your own Hike” I believe I pretty much do this in life but I added another deeper layer of meaning to this. It takes courage to do what is right for you to matter what everyone else is doing. In retrospect I should have done a little more of this in the beginning - starting out with less miles and taking more breaks. I think I would have lasted longer. However I traded this off for the comfort of being with an experienced hiker which I needed at the time. 
I learned a greater appreciation for the simple “ niceties” and comforts of every day life. Everyone should spend two weeks in the woods every year – it’s like Boot Camp - all those things we take for granted - A hot shower, flush toilet, a dry & warm bed, a hot cup of tea, a glass of wine, clean clothes, clean nails - you appreciate all of them sooooo much after having been deprived of them. 
I love being out in nature. I find it to be food for the soul. However, I found having to crank out that many miles a day - my head was mostly down watching my steps and I was beginning to not like nature (!) -I do not want that to happen! Life is way too short to do things that are not enjoyable if you don’t have to.
I was so fortunate to have no major injuries or issues. This old body actually held up really well! I did have two little “spills “ - one while attempting to cross a creek - big bruise down my right shin but managed to avoid hitting my artificial knee ( yeah!) the other -crossing some railroad tracks – got a matching bruise on my left shin - so at least I had a matching pair!
The bottom of my feet were really sore for several days. I think between the rocks and carrying the backpack weight they just needed to get used to it. Embarrassingly my worst injury was from my cell phone. I was lying down in a shelter with my legs propped up on a wall to help them feel better. I was holding my cell above me catching up on emails... you know where this is going - dropped the sucker right on my lip - it started to swell immediately! Duh! 
I feel like getting off the trail was the right decision for me. It was a difficult decision only in the respect that I had told EVERYONE I was doing the entire thing and wouldn’t be home for 6 months. I consider myself a person of my word. I almost always do what I say I’m going to do. In my head I planned for and totally set out to do the entire thing. For me it took courage to say - I’m done - I’m coming home. I decided that what I would really enjoy is shorter - like 5-7 day  backpacking trips. I think that will be my “ Sweet Spot”. 
I had so much amazing support from family and friends. Ron was my rock and “Knight in Shining Armor"". I missed him a lot.  My sister Carol is THE best sister in the world. Carol, Donn, Kate, & David went above and beyond. I know Dad and Ann are glad and relieved that I am coming home. My two amazing sons Mike and J were there for me before the hike, during and after. I felt like J really understood what I was saying from his own experiences. My Michigan buddy Kathy was a constant cheerleader and as always the best friend ever. My Dragon Sisters were beyond amazing with their encouragement, throwing me an amazing send off , and welcoming me back with open arms, no judgement but praise for what I did get done. My wonderful golf buddies did the same . Two of my childhood buddies - Lyn and Deb constantly checked in and cheered me on. Friends Karen and Stefan and my brother Ed sent me encouraging words. Many friends constantly checked in with Ron: Ralph and Lisa, Bob and Denise, Jay and Sandy, Mary and Pete. My Vineland neighbors made my homecoming so amazing as they had signed Welcome Home Posters which they posted along with balloons on my front door - you guys are the best! I am beyond grateful to my hiking mentors: Dede while I was getting ready &  also Perry . While I was in the trail -Hikezilla - I could not have done it without him. He even cooked me hot food! Firetrekker was amazing and I know he will nail it. Dudley and Gil were great. If my oxygen deprived brain left anyone out - I so apologize and know your encouragement was appreciated. Thank you, thank you all!!!! Crosstitch = over and out!!!",,Route 645 Parking lot,"May 03, Thu",2
Crosstitch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591135,"May 18 2018.  I have been off the trail for 2 weeks now. It took me a full week to recover my energy and for my legs to stop hurting. The second week was about recovery for my head. I have dreamed about the trail every night since my return. About 85 % of me is at peace with my decision to get off.  I discovered I dolove backpacking but I would enjoy shorter (week long) trips with friends so much more than a 6-month grueling solo journey. One of my main goals was to learn to navigate and make decisions for myself and not just follow someone else’s plan. However, I also learned that it is ok after making those decisions for yourself to then consult with whoever you are with and mesh your plans. Just don’t fall into the trap of blindly following someone else’s plan. I thought I was just fine with doing everything solo. I was surprised to find out that I was not. However, I did learn that - that it is ok as long as you think for yourself. We are pack animals and it is ok to want to be with people – as long as you think for yourself AND be ok with what you decide to do. Don’t throw your plans aside for someone else’s and then be resentful.

The remaining 15% of me wishes I could have a “do over” !!!!  I would start out with less miles and work my way up slower to more mileage. I would take more frequent breaks (zero days) at decent places to stay so I could be more refreshed. If I could I would have not had those really cold temperatures the first 2 weeks -  but I can’t do anything about Mother Nature!  

I was very happy with my gear choices. I was able to get my tent out of my backpack into a stuff sack and attach it to the outside (bottom) of my backpack which gave me way more room inside. This was a game changer. I was glad that I had “practiced” so many times with my gear along with packing and unpacking my backpack. I felt very prepared and organized. I could pack up pretty quickly. I think the key is a place for everything and always put everything in that same place. The only tweak I would consider at this time is : my feet became really sore on the bottom. I don’t know if this was from the rocks or from carrying all the weight of my pack – probably both.  I think for this I would purchase an insole – like “superfeet” to see if it would make a difference.

(no scale available) Interesting note here: I would estimate I was probably 6 – 8 pounds lighter when I got off the trail – but I did not have access to a scale and immediately started eating like there was no tomorrow! When I got home the scale showed only a 1 # wt. loss. However, as has happened to me in the past – after a long-distance event I seem to retain fluid for a few days. This happened here. After about the 5thday – I dumped a bunch of fluid (peed my brains out) and after wt: 119.5!

I had so many amazing emails welcoming me back. My 2 favorites :

From my Brother-in-law Donn:

Hiker Sis, Someone once said ""not up for the challenge"". I say.....You WERE up    to the challenge and found the challenge wasn't worth it to you. I am very very proud of you.

From my friend Tom Hosken:

Let’s set the record straight - as I read you daily blog, I can’t remember a Day where you were HIKING in the 16+ days on the Trail.  The Correct statement (based on your daily Blog) should have read:

Mountain Climbing 10-14 miles a day is just enjoyable.  

Hiking is not Climbing Boulders taller then you are, Crossing Steams where you have to remove your Boots and Socks due to the depth of the stream, Enduring        Temperatures in the 20’s with hours of being in Freezing RAIN & ending each day with not a piece of clothing on your that is Dry! 

You earned your Merit Badge so wear in with Pride

My favorite quote was sent to me by my friend Don Weber:

“ Camping is where you spend a small fortune to live like a homeless person”","Home!

Crosstitch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631340,Hi all! I’m apologize but I’m probably not going to be able to blog this trip - cell service is really poor and the peeps I am with told me it is not a good idea to put your location down for safety ????. Duh! So I will tell you all about it when I get home! So far the scenery is beautiful. We have done 10.5 miles in the last 2 days - doesn’t sound like much but with 30+ pounds in your back and some steep accents - it’s plenty for me! So again sorry but I’ll tell you all about it when I get home!!!,,View Entry,"Oct 12, Mon",0
