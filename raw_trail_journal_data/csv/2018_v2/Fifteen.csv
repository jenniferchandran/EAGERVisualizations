Fifteen,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592524,"Well I'm here in Waynesboro, Va. and will start the hike tomorrow in the rain. Tonight I am at Grace Lutheran church, they hostel for thru hikers. Tonight there are about ten of us here. Very mixed group. People from all over, one from Austria, one from New Zealand, state of Indiana, Wisconsin, Pennsyvania, Colorado, Virginia, myself Idaho and others I have not talked to yet. The big topic is the rain that has had most of these people soaked for days. They've had deaths from people one county over from the flooding. Hopefully my ridge walking will not be that bad. Some of these folks are going to set out the next three days of rain because Monday is supposed to be clearing up. Tomorrow is a go for me unless it is downright torrential. Support from all of my friends is what will keep me going so if you guys would get on and make entries it would be greatly appreciated. I will try to keep the journal up to date when I am in town at a computer.Just sitting around relaxing and talking with these fellow through hikers is very fulfilling, it is a great community of folks.Well tomorrow is the day, wish me luck!!!Fifteen aka Rex Donahoo","
