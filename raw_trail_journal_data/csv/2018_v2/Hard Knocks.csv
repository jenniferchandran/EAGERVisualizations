Hard Knocks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582573,"Last night (Jan.29) I got on a bus in New Orleans. This morning I was picked up in Atlanta by a shuttle and dropped off near the approach trail and immediately started my northward trek. I hiked the approach trail. I had heard that it was challenging and that is not a lie.
Yes, I know it is January and yes, I know I will be hiking in the cold. One of my main reasons for leaving so early is that I want to beat the rush and not have to compete for trail/shelter space. Also, I plan on taking my time and getting to Katahdin while the weather is still nice there. 
I hope to keep this journal going as completely as I can. But in the interest of full disclosure, I will sometimes forward information to my brother who will then post it here for me so my info will sometimes be running a little behind.

Buy quality trekking poles and know how to use them.

I have found that if you buy groceries with a couple of other hikers you can buy larger quantities for cheaper and get a bigger selection. Someone asked how I dropped 12 lbs from my pack. To start with my pack was about 40 lbs before food and water.  It did not feel too bad at first but after a few miles it was way too heavy.  I ridded myself of some nice,but un-necessary tools (scissors, leatherman, small hammer/ax). Also, it is true what they say about blue jeans and other cotton clothes. They are heavy and they weigh too much and they don't dry out. Plus I had too many. Also, travel size toiletries are a must.  My pack is an 85l Osprey and it is working out really well.  There is a small section I call the brain bag that I keep some essentials in that I can take off and carry separately when it is not convenient to carry the whole pack...like in town to eat.  A point worth noting:  just because you have an 85l pack, that doesn't mean you have to fill it up!So now there will be a little more spring in my step when I'm a walkin'","

I find that when people recount their experiences it is always adversity that makes for the best stories. And I am here for the full experience. I fell and went for a little slide in the mud. That makes six times I have gone vertical but I am sure that number will go up before this is all over. 
Knowing that I would be burning lots of calories, I purposely gained a couple of pounds before embarking on this adventure. After a few days on the trail 'hiker hunger' set in and I have been eating plenty. Still, after one week of hiking I had lost seven pounds. That is not a problem but if it keeps up I will consciously have to up my caloric intake.
