Fonla,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593430,"Katahdin and first leg of wilderness beat me up badly. Probability due to eating zero those two days. All I wanted was water. Lesson learned as a 79 year old. Up and down Katahdin took me 14 hrs. Next day walk to Golden Road (mile 15.4) took 10 hrs. Tough rocky trail, up and down. Got off trail to Chicago. My next section will be Harpers ferry north until I get to ??? Loving it so far.","
