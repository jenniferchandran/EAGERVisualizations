Gypsy Life,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581261,"Hi all, my name is John and I am 55 years old and recently retired. Thanks for tuning in, I appreciate your interest in this journey I am planning.  My start date is not till middle of March 2018 but working through logistics, accumulating gear and training are all underway now, so excitement is building.  The journey from  Springer Mountain, Georgia, to Mount Katahdin, Maine, is 2,189 miles (~3,500 km) and I am planning on 6 months to complete it, starting in mid-March and ending mid-September. I will be hiking Northbound (NOBO).  
As my start date draws nearer, the question why is coming up more frequently. Well, retirement has given me the time to tackle this trail but truth be told I was preparing to take a leave of absence had an early retirement option not opened things up for me. So the real reasons for why I want to do this are:to experience an extended period of being “off-grid” in a wilderness settingto climb my first mountain (and then many more after that)to experience the simplicity of trail life – eat, walk, eat, walk, eat, sleep, repeatto experience three seasons outdoors, day and night, day in, day outto enjoy trail life and town visits with new people along the waybeing away and living without the many luxuries of my everyday life, I hope to gain a better appreciation for the many blessings that I take for granted – the people I am close to, hot showers, dry clothes, good food, clean & running water. to experience and overcome the physical challenge of itsome mysterious reason that I can't put my finger on but may discover while on the trailI am dedicating my efforts on the trail to my Mom who passed away this last year. A more supportive, generous and thoughtful person you won’t find on this earth. While not a big ""outdoors"" person, my Mom was always so tremendously supportive of all of her children and grandchildren - she had the firmest belief that we could all do anything we set our minds to and would carry this belief even when our own beliefs failed.",,View Entry,"Nov 30, Thu",0
Gypsy Life,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581263,"OK, now it is official, I have the plane ticket from Pearson to Atlanta booked for March 13. It leaves at 8:30 am and lands at 10:30. I will then need to get from the airport to the MARTA subway and take that a few stops to meet up with a guy named  Survivor Dave who runs a shuttle service up to Amicalola Falls State Park - should be there by 3'ish. I am planning on staying in the state park on the 13th, then starting the hike on the morning of the 14th. Starting from the park means there is an 8.8 mile (14km) hike just to get to the top of Springer Mountain which is the actual start of the A.T.. I am camping at the Stover Creek Shelter that first night which is only 2.8 miles (4.5k) further up the trail. Oboyoboyoboy, getting real.A note on the imperial system - I know most of the readers will be my friends and relatives from Canada - thanks for reading! - I know that some of you older readers will have some vestige of the imperial system, but you young'uns won't and that might be problematic. All trail references are in miles and it will just be easier to continue to reference in miles instead of multiplying by 1.6 to come up with the kilometres, so while I have done the math in the paragraph above, I won't be keeping that up over the entire 2,189 mile (3,500 km) trail.  Also pack references and gear weight is more commonly reported in pounds, not grams and kilograms, so sorry if this forces you to pull out a calculator.",,View Entry,"Dec 02, Sat",0
Gypsy Life,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581264,"In the past I have taken on many different outdoor pursuits starting with canoe tripping on flatwater, advancing to white water and river tripping then to white water kayaking. I have been a long distance runner, downhill skier, cross country skier, participated in triathlons, raced mountain bikes, and more recently a backpacker. Every change of focus gave me a reason to explore the wonderful world of Gear specific to that sport – awesome!
All to say, after months (literally) of investigation, comparison, and testing, I have finally settled on and bought my new pack – an Osprey Atmos 65 AG - 4lbs 6oz (2.0 kg). This is 2 pounds heavier than my current Osprey Talon 44 but I really needed the extra space (21 more litres!) and comfort of the thicker hip belt. I could smash everything into the Talon 44 and dangle stuff off the outside but that made the pack lumpy and uncomfortable, so I am up-sizing. I am still trying to keep my base weight (all gear minus food and water) below 20 lbs, so you can see why this extra 2 lbs of pack weight is a big decision and would take so long to make, right? At this point, I am still trying to work out how to get the weight of all my other gear down to make up for this 2 pounds, so still fine-tuning to decide which “luxury” items I can afford to take along. Once I have finalized what I am starting with, I will post the whole mess.",,View Entry,"Dec 10, Sun",0
Gypsy Life,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581866,"Happy New Year everyone. Good luck with all your 2018 new year resolutions. Well, it is no secret what my 2018 Resolution is...Hike the AT!!
My launch date is getting closer - 65 sleeps! Training lapsed a bit over the Christmas break but is back on track now. Got some great additions to the gear kit over Christmas and will do a few posts on what I am planning on taking along. 
The Big Four items - pack, shelter, sleeping bag and pad weigh in at 10.5 lbs. The biggest / heaviest is the Atmos 65 pack at 4.3 lbs but as I said earlier, I wanted the beefier hip belt and extra space of this larger pack. I have taken the top or ""brain"" off the pack to lighten up a bit and will lose ~3 litres of capacity but also lose about 0.3 lb. If I am able to downsize my kit over the course of the trek, I may go back to my Talon 44 and save 2 lbs. 
The Big Agnes Fly Creek UL is light and easy to set up. I've had it on 2 week-long trips and while it is a good lightweight option, I find getting into and out of the tent awkward but I will live with it for now. If this becomes too much of a pain, I may switch back to my Eureka Spitfire which is 1 lb heavier but has a side entrance.
For sleeping bag, I have a -10C bag and have added a thermolite liner for extra warmth. This liner weighs almost as much as my sleeping bag (~1 lb) so I will be keeping it only until it warms up in April, then will send home and pick up a lightweight silk liner just to protect the bag from getting too yucky (the liner can be washed periodically). For sleeping pad I have a Neo Air X-lite which is light weight and comfy, but for anyone that has camped with me knows the annoying crinkling paper sound made every time I shift around.Recently added to my sleeping system the sea to summit inflatable pillow thanks to a very timely Christmas gift from my son Keegan!
These big four add most of the weight to the pack (other than food of course) and I am happy with the 10.5 lbs, especially since I can possibly go down 2.5-3 lbs if I unload the thermo-light liner and go back to the Talon 44 pack if I need to.",,View Entry,"Jan 02, Tue",0
Gypsy Life,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581868,"Ok, so these gear entries may be of more interest to the backpackers out there, feel free to skip over these. It is because I am spending a silly amount of time researching, collecting and weighing different options that I want to document what I have collected, but understand completely if this holds no interest for you.My camp kitchen weighs in at 1.2 lbs excluding the weight of the butane canister that powers the stove. I don't include the weight of the canisters with my base weight as it starts out heavy and depletes over time, like food. So my kitchen includes the MSR Pocket Rocket stove and lighter, Snow Peak Titanium 700ml pot (thanks to the boys at my old work!), a butane canister stand, a home-made pot cozy, aluminum windscreen, cup/bowl, long handle titanium spoon and spork (which I might ditch) and camp suds, bristle pad for cleanup.The pot cozy works really well and will save fuel. Most meals are prepared with boiling water and rather than simmering, you just put the pot and contents into the cozy for 15 mins and it comes out hot and hydrated!",,View Entry,"Jan 03, Wed",0
Gypsy Life,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581869,"Water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink.
All water on the trail needs to be purified. I am planning on using mainly aquatabs/ katadyn tabs or the aquamira drops for most of my purification. I have used these on past trips and they work well, though having to wait for them to do their thing requires a bit of planning. In colder weather you need to wait longer as well, so I am also taking a Sawyer squeeze mini filter which purifies fairly quickly if I need an immediate refill. I have two collapsible containers for water - a one litre Vapur wide mouth container and a 2.5 litre platypus. I also carry a gatorade bottle that I use for ""dirty"" water when using the sawyer squeeze. 
The widemouth Vapur is good for when I want to add gatorade or electrolyte replacing crystals and this attaches for easy access to the shoulder strap on my pack.   Total weight of water related items 0.8 lbs.",,View Entry,"Jan 04, Thu",0

Weather at the start is going to be variable and cold so I am opting for the running shoes and have found lightweight Merrill shoes (1 lb). I will likely switch back to sandals as the warm weather kicks in.Other items in this picture include folding toothbrush, paste, floss, sunscreen, petzl mini headlamp and replacement battery, ear plugs, swiss army manicure knife, super glue (equipment repair and some injuries), ear swabs.

But, it is all I am taking, and basically all that anyone hiking the trail is taking so I think we are all collectively hoping that no significant injury occurs.The kit consists of: 2 alcohol swabs, a bunch of Motrin and Tylenol, different size gauze pads and bandages, some steri-strips, polysporin squirted into a little baggy with cotton swabs to apply, a needle and thread, a pen cap with leuko tape rolled around it (for blister protection) and a tick remover tool.Fingers crossed!",,View Entry,"Jan 06, Sat",0

Gypsy Life,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582051,"I am still learning the ins and outs of logging entries, tried to paste in my menu for the first week and it looks too small to read but I can't figure out how to delete it.Some people have been asking about food on the trail....the day in, day out exertion of long distance hiking burns a huge number of calories (5,000-6,000 per day), so replacing these can be a challenge, especially since you have to carry all that food. So you try to carry foods that have a high calorie to weight ratio which means lots of fats and sugars. My fitness class instructor, Charlotte, is going to like this entry, especially since she is always trying to get us to cut out sugar. The menu below is for my first week, and subsequent weeks will look similar with maybe less of the prepared dried meals (ie Backpacker's Pantry, etc). There are resupply points along most of the trail every 4-6 days (with some exceptions) so a typical week would be to start out with 5 days of supplies (~7.5-10 lbs). Day 1:

Gypsy Life,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582402,"I have now packed, unpacked, repacked, unpacked and packed again, so I think I am done with gear selection and pulling everything together. I am sure there are things that I will change up after a few weeks on the trail to tweak the setup. Base weight 21-22 lbs depending on the size of the charger I choose and whether I bring a camera.
48 days and counting, so, what am I forgetting? Out of country health insurance – check, plane ticket to Atlanta – check, phone SIM card – going to Niagara Falls, NY on Monday to pick up….Oh yeah, I will be away for 6 months and just coming to realize how long that really is when I  look at all the things that need to be looked after - bills to pay and family finances, family birthdays, taxes to file, lawn & yard maintenance, cottage company book-keeping for a shared family vacation property, Community Tree Nursery – over the last 5 years I have been the lead for a volunteer community-based nursery that cultivates environmental stewardship among community youth and grows trees to increase the coverage in our township. 
So this post is a shout out to my key supporters who are going to be left “holding the bag” while I am gone. First and foremost is my wife Heidi who has been great helping me sort through communication options (phones, plans, chargers, etc) and logistics for meet-ups along the trail. She will also continue to look after the household finances and chores (with some help from my son Keegan) and will also pick up some cottage book-keeping and tax filings. Hopefully nothing major goes askew with the house while I am away.  
The next up is a shout out to Ann and the entire TWEEC and Trees for Woolwich crew who will be stepping up to manage the nursery initiative so we don’t lose any traction over the coming growing season – it was really great to see the level of commitment and enthusiasm at our recent planning meetings for the upcoming season. I will be praying for a nice balance of rain and sun over the coming summer in Woolwich (and for more sun than rain along the A.T.!)

Full pack with first 3 days food and water. Big snowfall overnight 15+cm (6+ inches) so footing was poor and very slow pace (3 kph). Beautiful day though, lots of white tail deer, and beautiful sunshine in the afternoon but cold -8C.

Gypsy Life,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582866,"Let the Games begin!
I am grateful that the Olympic Games are finally here – this is a welcome distraction from the all-consuming focus on all things Appalachian Trail related. I think Google is going to rebel the next time I type in the two words “Appalachian Trail” (AT meal planning, AT lightweight equipment, AT – protecting against ticks, Geology of AT, AT – Flora and Fauna, AT – best places for mail drops, AT best trail towns, AT best hostels, etc., etc. etc.). Fellow hikers, is it just me? Or is everyone that is getting ready for this trip this obsessive?

My latest obsession has been around mail drops – mailing from Canada is expensive and problematic as sending food over the border is a bit dodgy. Instead, I am going to bring a mail drop box with me on my flight to Atlanta filled with foods that I am allowed to take over the border, I will top up for the missing meal components (meats, mainly) then drop in the mail to Fontana Dam. At this point I am thinking that I will only do 2 other drops – one for Harper’s Ferry and one for Monson, ME – as I get closer to these spots I will fill boxes at one of the larger towns and mail forward.

My training continues with lots of snowy walking around town and on local trails with a fully-loaded pack on as well as “pack-on” treadmill climbing at our community centre. A lot of questions are raised when out and about with the pack on like “Who’s that goofy guy walking downtown with a huge backpack on”, “Did you see the homeless guy walking through the north end of town?”       

I have been keeping up with other hikers’ journals that have already started their journey – it is great to hear about your travels and it is adding to the excitement for my own start on Mar 13!

My brother and his family surprised me their inventiveness - they had come up with an A.T. Board game modeled after Trivial pursuit. Paul had done a ton of research on the trail, so the questions were great. It was a lot of fun and my little acorn made it all the way to Maine, so I will take that as a good omen.  When the gang learned that trail names are supposed to be assigned, they didn’t like the fact that I had picked one already and held a contest to come up with another. Each of them came up with one choice and there was quite a selection! In the end, after learning about the “pointless up and down” acronym, PUD,  they picked that, and said I can call myself anything I want but will always be Pud to them. Good thing for me that the tradition is to have other people on the trail pick a trail name, not family sitting at home!

I have sprayed down my hiking clothes, tent and backpack with Permethrin - I don't recall if I mentioned how paranoid I am about the ticks on the trail, in any case I am, I really don't want to get Lyme disease. So, I had picked up a bottle of Permethrin in Niagara Falls US - this stuff isn't available in Canada - and I have applied to my pack, tent and hiking clothes, this stuff is supposed to kill ticks on contact and has to be reapplied every 42 days. Working out the final details on when people might be coming to join me on the trail - there are 5, possibly 6 times over the course of the hike that I will be joined by different folks - it will be really great to have some company on the trail and everyone is staggering their visits so this will provide some great motivation to keep at it to meet up with you.As I write this, the snow is coming down outside so you would think travelling 1500km south I could expect much warmer conditions but current forecast is for just below zero C overnight and sunny +4/5C during the day.

I think climbing the last hill to the shelter, that this has been the closest to true hypothermia that I have been. There was no turning back and no warm fire waiting. When I arrived around 6pm  the shelter spots were taken so had to tent. Setting up in high wind, freezing fingers was brutal. Feet were wet and freezing so had to get out of those first, then right into sleeping bag. Attempted to cook dinner in the vestibule, while still in A mummy bag - a bit of a disaster.

Parted company with gravity, jinx, Kenya who were getting a shuttle back to Harper's ferry while I hitchhiked into Smithsburg. Got a ride quickly and ended up at the dollar general by 745. Forgot that it is memorial day and everything is closed though this store is to open later today. I am meeting Dave and Trevor at 3 so some time to kill which I spent most of in the laundromat as the only restaurant in this small town is closed. Spent the entire morning in the laundromat, then went to the dollar general to resupply for the next five days hiking with Dave and Trevor.
Trevor's brother drove up from Harrisonburg, VA to shuttle the boys and pick me up - he was a great trail angel and brought a huge container of fresh strawberries- yum! He will also meet us at the end, near Boiling springs - both these trips are big drives so this is hugely appreciated- trail magic!
We got on trail by around 4 and a short hike to the shelter which had a great camping area complete with picnic tables. Met up there with g-bolt and recon.
A big thank you for the care package  sent by my wife Heidi and a shout out and thank you to the morning fitness crowd at WMC for the well wishes video that Trevor  brought with him.

My tongue was numb and I had sugar shakes and couldn't think very clearly afterwards, so probably not the smartest challenge. But I am officially in their books s having completed it. After the challenge we went looking to camp, and the skies opened up, finally found a spot with some help from trail angels.

We had a good breakfast in town, then I went to the outfitters and got replacement shoes - my third pair so far. My last ones had 650 miles on them, more than my targeted 500 miles. I went with Oboz hikers this time.Saying goodbye to Dave and Trevor was hard, I wanted to jump into the car with them, the rest of today's hike will be a bit of a mental battle.

Finally got to do that after making a quick dinner, then right into bed to ride out the next wave of storms coming through.Another state down and Connecticut is going to be a shorter one so should be through that in 3-4 days.

So sorry for not taking that picture to share with you.
While it was really cool too just roll over and watch the sunrise, being in the shelter and battling the mosquitoes all night wasn't too much fun, it will have to be raining pretty hard before I sleep in one of those again.
The push was on for a town day,, we all wanted to get showered and laundered so faster pace and fewer breaks made for a tough hiking day. Food was scarce too as we were on fumes in our food bags so all we could think about was getting to a restaurant. There were a couple of tough long climbs and technical descents - Bear Mtn and Mt Everett (not a typo!) That really slowed things down. Still we got to the hwy around 2 and finally got a hitch after 20-30 minutes in a light drizzle. Rain started soon after we got in and settled at the Travelodge, so good timing.
This place is close to McDonald's (2 mcchickens, 1 cheeseburger, 1 big Mac, fries and coffee- just a light pre dinner snack ;-). It is also close to a brewery where we spent the evening until I couldn't keep my eyes open (only 2 beers before exhaustion settled in).

After this break we had to go into climbing mode and I had very low energy making the day a real bear. It was hot, I hadn't got enough water and had to conserve over an 8 mile stretch which really sucks. Part of the reason for not having enough is that might Sawyer mini is painfully slow so I always put it off, I'm getting the larger filter when I get into town.

Took two more falls today, scrapes, nothing serious, it is more my heart rate that spikes when I go down because the potential for serious falls is high here.
We got to Full Goose which was supposed to be our lunch stop at 230. Rain was in and off but really settled in after 330 so we decided to stay put. Good we did because it came down in buckets accompanied by thunder and lightning. Others headed out about 30 minutes beforehand, we felt bad for them being caught in that. The next stretch includes Mahoosic Notch, the toughest mile on the AT so we were happy to leave that until tomorrow morning when legs are fresh.

This section is a one mile stretch of huge rocks that requires more rock climbing ability than hiking. It was very difficult but kind of fun too. It would have been more enjoyable if it wasn't so slippery. Google some you tube videos of the notch if you want to get an idea of the conditions. It took us just over 2 hours to get through this one mile stretch! Sections of the notch are quite cold and we saw some ice low down. Water was flowing huge through the bottom section and we had to wade through a 40 metre stretch of thigh high water at the end of it.
Next was the Mahoosic Arm which is a long (1600 ') difficult climb which was also really slow going up long stretches of bald slippery granite.

Gypsy Life,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600365,"5 miles to go! Woke this morning as usual at 515 and broke camp for the final time - this was the start to a day that would be a bit of an emotional roller coaster. As I packed everything up I was upset that this would be the last time even though I have been pushing to finish. Sky looked clear and it was cool for the start of the hike which was a gradual climb up the Hunt trail for first mile, a nice warm up. Then it started getting steeper with large boulders and then steeper still with tricky rock climbing sections. I had stowed my poles and left much of my gear at the ranger station so that the lighter pack made it a bit easier going. The rock climbing was kind of fun and I made good time.When I first cleared the tree line there were stunning views on this clear sunny morning and I stopped and reflected on how thankful I am to get to this stage of the journey with full health, no injuries. I actually thanked my feet who are the unsung heroes of this trip, putting up with the worst possible treatment, day in, day out.
The climb continued through more and more steep tricky sections before I reached the tableland / gateway, which is a more gradual bouldery climb before reaching the last final steep section to approach the  summit.
I passed over 25 day hikers on the way up, it took me just under 3 hours where day hikers are advised to allow for 4-5 hours for the climb (all those new Hampshire and southern Maine mountains paid off!). When I got to the top there was Capt Ahab, Tiger Lily, Blue Whale and Hot wheels who had hiked up to see the sun rise. It was very emotional as they applauded my final approach.
Got the pictures done then found a quiet place on the summit to reflect on the whole journey, remembering Mom and my dedication of this journey to her memory, remembering all the support from family, friends, and all the many trail angels that helped restore my spirits along the way. It unexpectedly brought me to tears which I had trouble getting stopped. I had been up there around 30 minutes when some of the larger day hiker groups started to show up so I got ready for the descent. Just as I was leaving, Pace car and pacman showed up and Pace car broke into tears which set me off all over again.I made my way with blurry eyes down the Abol trail and kept having these surges of emotion, elation for finishing, sadness that it is all over.I got back to the ranger station and picked up my gear then stopped at Katahdin stream to fill up on water, and after afternoon having so much as a slip all day, fell completely into the stream - no not a soaker, I fell right down with submerged head and all, brilliant! As I climbed out of the water dripping wet, Capt Ahab offered me a ride into Millinocket with his family which was fantastic as it would have been a long hitch. The only question was who was going to sit beside the soaking wet guy?Got into town and blue whale and I went for a late lunch where I ran into Seven and Double tap who had summitted the day before. It was so great to see those guys and catch up. Gravity and Kenya had finished a day before them and left town that morning, so I just missed them.I am wasting no time getting the journey home started and will head to Medway tonight and catch a bus to Bangor in the morning, followed by a bus to Toronto the next day - it is a long trip but as Heidi pointed out, I have been looking for some time to put my feet up!Thanks to all those who have been reading along and adding to my guest list, those comments provide a great boost!
