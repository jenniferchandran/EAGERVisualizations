Bumpa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/482447,"I feel like starting a trail journal two years prior to the start of my hike is a bit premature. Truth told, it will take me that long to get my life in order to allow me to make the trek.    Hiking the AT has not been a life long dream......I haven't been hiking that long. I started backpacking in 2009 on the Long Trail in Vermont. My Wife and I had taken a trip to L.L. Bean in Maine and found backpacks in the clearance section for an amazing price. we bought them with good intentions to give backpacking a try. Two years later, the packs were still hanging in the back of the closet. When we did finally give it a shot, we did everything wrong!    We both grew up in Vermont so that should have qualified us as woodsmen automatically. We didn't bother to do any reading or even seek much for advise and to top it off, we dragged our kids into the woods with us. The details of the hike are both sad and comical but while eating a pint of Ben and Jerry's and reflecting on our adventure my wife and I decided that we could hike better and set out to get educated and far more prepared. Our kids however have vowed to never set foot in the woods again. Other then one fathers day overnight they have been true to their vow.    Armed with packs that were fit correctly, clothes that were not cotton and roughly 30 pounds lighter, we tried again. This was a much different experience and far more enjoyable. We hiked 100 miles of the AT/LT in Vermont before we moved to Virginia in 2012. Once in Virginia we started section hikes and have covered the AT from Rockfish Gap south to Catawba. The more I hiked, the more I loved it.",,It's going to be a long wait......,"Feb 28, Sat",0
Bumpa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/482526,"The more miles I hiked, the more I thought about possibly doing a thru-hike. At first, my idea had my wife and I hiking together. This was a great idea, but for as much as my wife loves to do section hikes, she will be the first to tell you that after 5 or 6 days, she is ready to be done. This morphed into me doing a thru hike, and my wife joining me for two or three sections along the way.     So my start date is March 1st 2017. I am planning to hike south (GA) to north (ME) and will come off the trail in June for a few days to attend my youngest daughter's high school graduation. After that, it is straight thru to Maine. I can't wait!",,Continued....,"Mar 01, Sun",0
Bumpa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/482527,"Two years from today I pray that I will be starting my thru-hike! In some ways it seems as if that is forever away, and in other ways it seems like it is fairly close. I wish that it could be next year or even next month, but I wouldn't be ready so it is better this way.    To celebrate the occasion, my wife Pony Stride (Julie) and I put on some warm clothes and headed up onto the AT. We are about a 35 minute drive from the parking area next to the James River foot bridge just outside Big Island, VA. The trail was covered with ankle deep snow, and there was only one set of tracks to step with, but we headed north for the John's Hollow shelter about two miles in. I wish I could say that it was a beautiful day, but for most of the hike in we got sleeted on. The good thing is that the sleet stopped just before we arrived at the shelter. We had a great lunch and relaxed for a bit and then headed back. The last entry in the register was Feb. 15th. It felt great to be on the trail if only for a few miles.",,Only Two Years To Go,"Mar 01, Sun",0
Bumpa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548794,"I started my trail journal early, but with great anticipation that I would be starting my through hike in the spring of 2017. Anyone who has lived it knows that life happens! In this case, life happened in a great way.    My wife and I had an opportunity to purchase a piece of land and have started to build a home on it. We are building the house ""out of pocket"" so that when it is done and we move in, we will have no mortgage. It is a tiny (400 sq.ft.) house and should be very efficient to operate. We plan to move in in August of 2017, which is what messed up the plans for the first through hike date I had. The new plan will have us saving tons of money from August 2017 until March of 2018. This savings will both fund my hike and serve as a financial buffer for my beautiful wife while I am on the trail.    Meanwhile, we continue to day hikes and short section hikes. We will be doing a 61 mile section of the SNP next month, and it will fill in the last section we need to complete from Catawba, VA to Harpers Ferry, WV. For anyone who is interested, I have a blog about our land and cabin at:http://thehomesteadhollow.blogspot.com~Bumpa",,Life Happens,"Sep 15, Thu",0
Bumpa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549188,"The discussions that surround what and how much to carry while on a thru-hike are endless. I see the topic as very personal. It is up to the individual to make those choices, for good or for bad.    I have found that I need to find and acceptable balance between pack weight and comfort. There are items that I choose to carry knowing full well that they are either not needed, or that there is a lighter weight option. On the flip side, there is gear that others wouldn’t hit the trail without that I don’t carry. What I have learned is that if I am regularly uncomfortable, I will not enjoy the hike as much. That discomfort can come in many forms, a pack that is to heavy, a sleep system that is to hard or to cold, excessive hunger from not enough food, or generally not feeling well because of eating “crap” for to long. Like most hikers I expect, I continue to “tweak” my gear a little here and a little there. New products become available or a more appealing option is presented, so I will never set my gear list in stone, but I’m pretty happy with what I have. My pack will usually hit in the 35-40 pound range when I set out on a long hike. To some to heavy, to others enviably light.",,What to take?,"Sep 21, Wed",0
Bumpa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560559,"It has been a long time since I have posted, and it’s time I get with the program. So much has been happening! My start date changed from 2017 to 2018 because my wife (Pony Stride) and I purchased 7 acres of land and planned to build our house on it.        So the house is moving along very well. If you have viewed our blog (link in previous post) please know that it is way behind. As of right now, we are installing flooring and plan to put in trim and cabinets in the next couple of weeks. Our original move in date of Aug. 1st 2017 is still our goal, and so long as we can come up with the needed funds (we are building “out of pocket”) we should be able to make it.        So what has that got to do with an AT thru hike? Well, in my case, just about everything! Once we are moved in, our monthly expenses drop to a level that my wife’s income will be enough to cover bills while I’m on the trail. I will still have to get enough money into savings to cover my hike, but it will make it possible to do.        As of right now I plan to do a flip-flop hike. Harpers Ferry to GA, Harper Ferry to ME. My start date is March 16-17 2018. The 16th should be my last day at work (yes, I’m quitting my job to do this) and I hope to drive to Harpers Ferry that night.",,Get with the program,"Apr 18, Tue",0
Bumpa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562573,"I’ve wanted to make this post for quite a while, but have been hesitant. After many discussions and attempting to look into the future, I can now say that my 2018 Thru-hike is a firm “GO”. 

         As of now, it looks like we will make our goal of August to move into our new house. We have made a lot of progress, and we are on track. If you want to see how it is coming check out: http://thehomesteadhollow.blogspot.com

         That leaves me 319 days before my projected start date of March 17th 2018. I have already determined the items that I want to add or change to my gear, and it is a very do-able list. The biggest single change is a one-man tent. My awesome wife, Pony Stride, and I have been hiking together for a long time, and we use a two-man tent. This single change will drop 4 lbs. off my pack weight. I won’t know for sure for a while, but I’m thinking my base should be around 25 to 28 pounds.

         The most challenging and time-consuming preparation I need to do is to get in much better shape. I would like to drop about 20 lbs off my gut before getting started. I have a much easier time losing weight on the trail because options are limited, but it is much harder for me to pass up yummy food when it is all around me. The other thing I want to work on is cardio. I would like to avoid gasping for air after the first mile I hike.

         Here is a short list of red-letter dates that will mark mile-stones throughout the next 319 days.

March 13th  2017   Pony Stride graduates with her Masters Degree in Business Administration.

May 8th 2017   I turn 48

June 2nd 2017   My youngest graduates from Highschool

August 2017   We move in to our new house and become rent/mortgage free

October 2017   7 day shake down hike on the AT in the southern portion of VA

January 2018   Inform my employer that I will be leaving in March (scary).

March 16th 2018 Last day at work and drive to Harpers Ferry, WV

March 17th 2018 Start Flip-Flop hike Harpers-GA, Harpers-ME

         319 days seems forever away and at the same time just around the corner.

Bumpa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565474,"According to the handy dandy countdown app on my phone, I am 299 (under 300) days from starting my thru hike! I turned 48 a couple of weeks ago, and it dawned on me that I'll be on the trail for my next Birthday.I have a friend who has day-hiked for quite a while but had never done any overnight hikes. I have some extra gear, so I offered to supply him and go on an overnight hike to see if it was something he enjoyed before he went out and purchased his own gear. Because of time restraints, we just did a quick 2 mile hike in to John's Hollow shelter just north of the James River footbridge. I have seen many snakes while hiking but until this hike I had not run across a rattler. As we were walking, my friend stopped (he heard it, but didn't know what it was) and asked me if I saw anything. About a foot from the edge of the trail was a large Rattle snake. He was about as big around as my wrist and had a huge head. We gave him a wide birth and moved on. We got to the shelter with the sound thunder over head so we got tent and hammock set up quickly. We had been watching the weather very closely so that his first time out wouldn't be in the rain. When we left for the trail the forecast was for 20% chance of scattered showers with no more than .10 inches of rain possible. What we got was more like a monsoon! We sat in the shelter and watched a very intense two hour thunderstorm. There was no way to measure rainfall, but there were small rivers of water running next to the shelter. The good news is that we stayed dry and the rain did stop just before we called it a night. My friend got to meet a couple of NOBO thru hikers that were in the shelter, and we still had a great time. I was willing to call it a success when we got home and my friend wanted to know when we could go again.With all the cabin building and ridiculously busy schedules, I haven't put a pack on and hiked for WAY to long. I know I love hiking, but what a wonderful reminder of just how much. We are still trying to be living in the cabin this August so I plan on doing a lot more hiking soon!Bumpa",,View Entry,"May 21, Sun",0
Bumpa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568229,"So My son and I got very brave this weekend.......We took both of my grand sons (3 1/2 years old and 4 1/2 years old) on their first overnight hike on the AT. We started at the Jame River footbridge in VA and hiked in 2 miles Friday evening. When your only three feet tall, two miles is quite a hike! Armed with a tracking pole each (thank you Grammie) and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle back packs, the boys hiked like old pros. We made it into the shelter before dark and they helped get the tent set up. They were super well behaved and other then taking a while to get to sleep ( to much excitement) they did great. In the morning we cooked breakfast and filtered water for our long trek back to the footbridge. I was so proud of the boys and will call the trip an outstanding success. I also got to meet thru hiker Cricket, Hiking Home, and their other friend (sadly I'm drawing a blank on his name). I have been following Cricket's journal this year and was pleasantly surprised to run into her. 278 days, but who's counting?Bumpa",,View Entry,"Jun 11, Sun",0

My wife (Pony Stride) finished her Masters degree.4. Officially hit 200 days on my countdown for the start of my hike.Wow! That is  quite a bit of change all at once, but it is all good. Things are lining up that give me confidence that I will be able to make this hike happen.Pony Stride and I have two hikes coming up. September is a three day and October is a 9 day. I'll post some entries with some pictures.Bumpa",,View Entry,"Aug 29, Tue",0
