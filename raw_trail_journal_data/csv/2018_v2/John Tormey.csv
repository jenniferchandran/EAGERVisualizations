John Tormey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588081,"After injuring my knee 1,749 miles into my 2014 thru hike attempt, the idea of just finishing from New Hampshire seemed like a reasonable idea because it means less time away from home and loved ones, but there's that THRU HIKE thing, ya know?I flew down to Atlanta from Boston on Wednesday the 25th, took the MARTA to Sandy Springs, and UBERed to Amicalola Falls State Park. I registered as hiker #2415 and met a fellow hiker called Dogger. He's a past thru hiker and is hiking for a few weeks. He left me in the dust. Tired from a sleepless night and the travel, I dragged my weary butt up the 604 stairs to the top of the falls. A beautiful view and nice people along the way. The Administrator (my wife and best friend in the world) had booked me a room at the Lodge for the 26th because we learned that some severe weather was predicted for Thursday night (online reservations said there was nothing available Wednesday). I figured I'd tent nearby Wednesday night and then hike back in the morning. When I got to the top of the falls, I decided to grab a burger at the Lodge. When I told the lady at the desk about the reservations, she said online was wrong and she gave me a great deal for both nights cause I'm old. I'm glad she did because I wasn't just old I was beat.I used the time Wednesday to rearrange my pack and get some rest. Today, I'm kicking back watching the rain and getting ready to hike out in the sun tomorrow. I'm gonna take it slow and see where I go.","

John Tormey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588619,"  I left the Lodge at 7:15 and headed for Springer Mt.; 7.7 miles to the start of the Appalachian Trail. As I was leaving I saw a young man named Andy who I spoke with yesterday. He's heading out for a six day hike. I had noticed his backpack looked rather large so I asked him how much weight he was carrying. He told me 48 pounds. I suggested he might want to leave some weight behind and he said he'd give it some thought.    I had fully intended to make Springer Shelter my destination for the day. I thought that would be a nice way to start off, slow and easy, right?   The hike along the approach trail was pretty smooth going physically, but I was already questioning starting at such a late date. I met a Ridge Runner named Davis and he said the bubbles of thru hikers were all ahead of me.  I got to the plaque that marks the start of the trail at 11:30. There were a lot of day hikers there and I sat for an hour and had lunch. A young guy named Casey came by. He's hiking for 13 weeks. He said he was tenting on Springer last night and froze. By this time I had forgotten my, take it easy, intentions and decided to hike on. We went out together and gabbed all the way to Hawk Mountain campsite. The talk made the miles fly, and a nice foot soak in a cold spring along the way helped, but I knew I had done too much by the end of the day.   Hawk campsite is a newer tenting area. Bear boxes and a privy, who could ask for more?  We got there at 5:15. There were a few others there already. One of those was Andy. He said he left 8 pounds back at the Lodge.   It's a nice site, but there's no central spot for everyone to gather, so there wasn't too much chatter. I had a bit of supper, peanut butter and honey, washed up and went to bed.  Trail miles, 7.4. Total miles for the day 15.1. Ouch!","Amicalola Falls Lodge

John Tormey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588636,". Typical first night on the trail for me; I hardly slept at all. It takes me a while to get comfortable. It was pretty cold last night too. I decided on my 40° bag instead of my 20°, mistake. I figured I would bundle up in my long shirt and pants and be fine because I sleep warm, but it didn't work. I also made the mistake of over hydrating before bed so I was up a few times through the night. Not the best start.   I filtered some water from the nearby steam and headed out at 8:15. Casey was just getting up so I told him I'd see him down the trail.  I was still feeling uncomfortable about the hike. Feeling like I'm far behind is making me rush a bit. Sassafrass Mountain ended the rush. I forgot how difficult that climb was. I think it just sneaks up on you. Maybe it's the time is day. I've gone over it early in the day both times and the first big climb always gets me.  Lots of day hikers out; great weather! I decided to head to Gooch Mountain Shelter. Mike and I had stayed there last time and met Duck Tape and Sass there in 2014. There were only two guys there when I got in at 2:10. I bummed a couple Tylenol P.M., thanks guys.  I got something to eat and set up on a tent space. Bear boxes here too, nice to see. There were no designated spaces last time I was here, much better this way. A good water source not far away.  A bunch of people came in and I talked to a few, but it's not the same as before. There was one couple and one young guy who's pack weight is 17 lbs. are hiking thru, the rest are overnighters and short hikers. Casey came in late all happy because he was tagged with the trail name, ""Popper"". Someone on the trail said he looks like the guy from Blues Traveler.  Trying to change my frame of mind and get into this hike.","Hawk Mt. Campsite
