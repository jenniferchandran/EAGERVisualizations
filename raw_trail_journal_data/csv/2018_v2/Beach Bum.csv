Beach Bum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583129,"I am starting my Thru Hike on April 3rd.  For the weeks leading up to that, I have been / will be working on training, planning and gear preparation.  
 - Training:  I have been walking 4 miles per day for 4 days per week.  I've focused on walking four straight days since that is the typical duration of hiking from one town/hostel to another, meaning I will be able to take a Zero when I need to once hiking on the AT.  I'll up the distance to 6 miles per day starting March 1st.  And, I am planning one or two trips to the AT in Central Virginia to get some time in the mountains during March.  I'd like to hit the ground in Amicalola Falls S.P. in shape to comfortably hike 8 miles per day.  BTW: My pace section hiking on the AT over the past few years is as follows:  Low Gear = 1 MPH, Medium Gear = 2 MPH and High Gear = 3 MPH.  Low Gear is for uphill climbs.  Medium Gear is for gentle uphill switchbacks, steeper downhill grades or rocky trails.  High Gear is for places that are easy to walk up, down or flat.  I average 2 MPH on the average day.  So, hiking 8 miles will usually take me 4 hours of hiking, plus 1 hour of rest.  Add in camp set-up and take-down, and that makes for a nice 8-hour day.
 - Planning:  I am taking the general advice to not plan too much, since it is hard to predict what's going to happen.  But, for fun and to get the lay of the land, I have been learning about each section of the trail from Springer Mountain to Damascus.  It's interesting to read the comments people log on Guthook's maps (water sources, mice in shelters, etc.).  I'm also noting the places where I can stay in hotels or hostels.  From watching some videos on YouTube, I think some people wear themselves out by trying to accomplish too much or by trying to be ""true to backpacking"" and staying in the tents or shelters a lot.  I'm going to try to enjoy some of the towns along the way and stay in a nice bed from time to time, and take as many showers as I can.  I've also been testing some recipes for trail food.  Nothing complicated, but finding ways to spruce up the Ramen Noodles will be fun.  I'm trying to cook 100% in Zip Lock freezer bags to keep clean-up to a minimum.
 - Gear Preparation:  Two things.  First, I don't have the budget to get fancy ultra light equipment.  So, my pack will be 4 to 5 pounds heavier since I am saving significantly (money) on each piece.  That said, the equipment I have is sturdy, comfortable and sufficient for the challenge.  I've tested my set-up on numerous overnight backpacking trips on the AT, and I'm good with all of it.  I'm not an ultralight hiker, so I'll bring my Helinox Ground Camp Chair which weighs 1.2 lbs.  It is a great place to sit and also to stage equipment off the ground when setting up or breaking camp, so it has multiple uses.  Plus, I'm old and sitting on logs isn't very comfortable on my back / backside.  Second, I'm trying to work out my concerns about hiking and setting up camp in the rain.  My rain gear works well, so I'm really concentrating on where to pack it in my pack so I have easy access in a way that doesn't get other things wet when accessing or storing.  I've also been practicing setting my tent up by starting with the rain fly, then setting up the footprint and tent from underneath the fly (keeping thing as dry as possible.)  I've hiked in the rain and usually just stay in a shelter when it rains.  But, I want to be prepared for the event that I get to the shelter and it's full during a heavy rain.  So, there you have it.
Looking forward to meeting everyone!",,View Entry,"Feb 21, Wed",0
Beach Bum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585276,"Well, I'll be leaving for Atlanta on Monday morning (4/2/18) and then onward to Amicalola Falls Lodge, via the Visitor Center.  Over the past weeks I have completed my goals for hiking 4 times per week, between 4 and 6 miles each day, several with full pack, a couple times carrying my grandson (25 lbs) in a child backpack.  Actually, carrying my grandson was interesting since my cargo moved about and talked to me!  It kept me balancing my stride and it was entertaining.  While carrying my backpack on multiple trips, I was able to adjust how it was packed to it will be balanced.  I'm sure I will change how I pack it over the coming weeks, but it rides comfortably right now.  
I've been watching the weather along the southern AT and have seen how cold and snowy the weather has been, even in late March.  So, I've added a layer or two of clothing and added another spare pair of socks.  So, I'll be carrying two extra pairs of socks instead of just one.  I want to have one ""clean"" pair for sleeping and have two pairs to swap between dry days and wet days.  We'll see how that goes.  
Also, I just mailed off two drop boxes to Mountain Crossings and Top of Georgia Hostel.  That will be it for now, and I'll ask my wife to send another drop box to Fontana when I know better my schedule.  
So, I am as ready as I am going to be.  Not quite ""trail ready,"" but in good shape.  I'll start off slow and steady and enjoy the scenery.",,View Entry,"Mar 30, Fri",0

Beach Bum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585818,"April 3rd - I left the Amicalola Lodge around 8:10 AM and hiked the trail to the Hike Inn, then on to Springer Mtn.  I had lunch at the Springer Mountain Shelter and hiked onward to the Stover Creek Shelter.  In total, that was a 12 mike day.  Passed a group of about 20 Army Rangers carrying guns, ammo, rocket launchers and enormous backpacks. They were easily carrying 100 lbs each.  That’s why young people serve in the military!  Tonight it’s supposed to rain a lot.  I hope it’s over by morning.April 4th - I hiked from Stover Creek Shelter to Devils Kitchen camp site.  That’s about 12 miles.  Walked the whole way with a nice lady who was retired from the FBI.  She had great stories to share regarding FBI travels and personal travels.  It made hiking a lot of fun.  I set up camp and she headed to the next shelter.  I had a relaxing evening. April 5th - it was a cold night at Devils Kitchen camp site.  I woke up and put on every layer of clothing I brought with me.  After breakfast, I set out for Lance Creek campsite.  Within 5 minutes I stopped and took off one layer.  20 minutes later, I removed another.  It got really warm throughout the day.  I left my long underwear on, just because it’s a hassle removing your pants in public.  Anyway, it was great / warm weather.  I ran into great trail magic at Woody Gap.  Hot soup!  They also had tea, snacks and fresh water.  That was a nice surprise.  I hiked most of the day “alone” but met lots of folks.  Overall, a great day.  Tomorrow I am off to Neels Gap where I’ll have two nights in a cabin with hot showers and food from a kitchen.","Amicalola Lodge

Beach Bum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585989,"It takes me two hours to get up and break camp to start hiking.  My routine is to 1) pack up the inside of the tent, make coffee & eat, wash my face / apply sunscreen, top up water, take down tent & put in stuff bags, change from morning clothes (warm) to hiking clothes (much lighter but soon to be too warm, pack up back pack and then leave.  I’m working on streamlining this process.  I might try making coffee at night and drinking it cold in the morning.  I’ve tried being less fastidious about packing things neatly, but that makes packing too bulky.  I’ll keep trying.
On Friday, April 6th, I hiked from Lance Creek to Neels Gap, over Blood Mountain.  It was a short hike in distance, but it made up for it by being steep.  It took about 5 hours.  At Neel Gap I checked into my cabin (Squirrel Cabin) and had restful afternoon.  Today, April 7th, I’m organizing my stuff so I can fit in the food I shipped to myself.  Then I’ll head to bed early and take off for Low Gap Shelter (12 miles). So goes the journey.","Lance Creek Camp Site

Beach Bum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586349,"April 8 - Left the cabin at Blood Mountain Cabins at 9:00 AM and hiked the whole day in a winter wonderland due to frost covered trees.  The frost crystals dropped on the ground like snow.  Got to Low Gap Shelter and spent a cold wet night in a tent.  April 9 - Waited for the rain to stop at 8 AM get out of the tent, so it was a slow start.  It was cold and foggy all day until I got to Cheese Factory Tent Sight.  Then the sun came out and I could dry my tent out before setting it up.  The night was warmer.April 10 - Woke up to a sunny day.  It was cold at first but quickly warmed up.  I hiked to the Top of Georgia hostel at Dick’s Gap.  8 more miles until North Carolina!38 miles over the past three days!  That’s over 12 miles per day.  It makes you tired and that makes you sleep well.  Lots of fun.","Neel Gap
