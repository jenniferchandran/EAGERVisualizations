Tent Cents,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610024,"Paige, thank you for your interest, when I was on the trail I was very hungry.  One day we went into town they had all you can eat pizza and salad, I ate pizza for two hours.  When you hike for 8 to 10 hrs a day - you burn about 6-7k calories. Memorable experience was the beautiful views and people I met.","
