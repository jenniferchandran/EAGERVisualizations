Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593561,"Day 0 My AT section hike was complicated by the fact that I am running to be a state representative.  That meant my hike needed to start only a few days after my students graduated and I needed to get a campaign letter out before I hit the trail.  It wouldn’t have happened without help from a great group of friends, Bill and Ann, Joyce, Emery, Brent, and my wonderful wife.  Letters in the mail, I packed for the trail and we headed to Cincinnatti to stay with our sun Joel before an early morning flight to Baltimore.",,Off trail,"Jun 05, Tue",0
Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593562,"Day 1It was up at 5:15 for a 7:00 flight to Baltimore.  A friend, Mary and her husband, Dewey, are in charge of maintaining the trail in Southern Pennsylvania.  They live in Baltimore and Mary offered to help out with my hike when I make it their section.  She offered to pick me up at the airport and drive me to the MD/PA border.  She even hiked with me for the first few miles.  It also gave her a chance to check the trail for maintenance needs.  It was one of the best maintained sections I have hiked!  We hiked south fir about a hundred yards to the state line, also the Mason Dixon Line, I was hiking on the Northern part of the AT fir my first time.  I started my hike at 11:30 and did 12 miles to a campsite on Snowy Mountain.   The best view on the trail today was at Chimney Rocks, although the mountain laurel along the trail was awesome.","PennMarr, PA

Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593564,"Day 2
The day started by hiking 6 miles to Caledonia State Park.  It is a beautiful state park, but the first thing I was interested in was. Water from a faucet that I didn’t need to filter.  I met a young boy (maybe 4 or 5) who was walking with his grandmother.  He was curious about my pack and my hike.  I told him I hike about 200 miles each summer.  He replied, “I can count to 200!”  I think I met a future mathematician.  I had a snack at s picnic table with four through hikers.  They were looking enviously at a group of ladies a few tables over.  The ladies had quite a spread of food on the table and the through hikers were wondering if the ladies might offer them some.  I told the I would “prime the pump” for them.  As I got up to hike on, I stopped at he ladies table and said if they happened to Gabe any good left that hey didn’t want, the thru/hikers would be thrilled with it.  I learned later from the group of thru-hikers that the ladies came through with lots of food for them. I did 21 miles and camped at a great campsite.  The thru-hikers went another mike to the next shelter.  They had hiked from Georgia and didn’t know how to hang their food bag so they always stay at shelters that have some kind of bear system.  I like the idea of hiking until I find a great campsite along the trail.  This one was great except for the whipper-will that tried to sing me to sleep,  I carry ear plugs in case I sleep in a shelter with people who snore.  They also work for whipper-wills!","

Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593992,"Day 3I am on the trail at the peak of the mountain laurel bloom.  They are wonderful.  When I look up I see mountain laurels and when I look down I see lots of milky quartz.  One piece of quartz was about 8 feet long and 3 feet wide.  It was partially coated in bright green moss.  Many smaller pieces of quartz are along the trail.  Interesting fact - well, interesting to me - quartz is a predominant rock (or mineral?) in the Appalachian Mountains.  It contributes to the low ph of the region, which is what provides the perfect soil for mountain laurel, rhododendrons, and blueberries.  The mountain laurel is at its peak; unfortunately the blueberries are not.
I hiked to Pine Grove Furnace State Park.  It is known along the trail as the site of an AT museum and the site of the half-gallon challenge.  Thru hikers try to eat a half gallon of ice cream.  I opted for a pint, because I knew I had many more miles to hike.   The museum was great.  Besides the history of the trail, it had stories of early thru hikers.  Several of them hiked the trail in their 70’s.  Who knows, I might finish this thing yet.
I left the museum and headed north on the trail at the same time as a middle-aged couple.  The woman said to me, “You go first, because I am a slow hiker.”  I said we’d probably meet again because I took frequent breaks.  As I hiked along the gravel path through the park I heard them hiking behind me, and getting closer.  I hiked a bit faster, but they stayed right on my tail.  I hiked faster.  Finally, when the AT turned off the gravel path and headed up a steep incline, I decided I needed to step aside and let them pass.  To my surprise, it wasn’t the couple I had talked to earlier. It was two young men with very long legs.  The couple was too far back to be seen.  I slowed down my pace and headed up the mountain.
The plan was to do another 20 mile day.  It was mostly level with one big climb and something call a rock maze.  I pictured a bunch of rocks set in concentric circles on the flat top of a mountain.  The kind that people leisurely follow while meditating or contemplating life.  It was not that kind of maze.  It was a bunch of huge boulders that you had to go around, squeeze between, and climb over.  One was so large that I wasn’t sure I could climb over it with my pack - but I did.  There were arrows and white blazes to show the way, but I was pretty sure there was a more direct path without quite so many climbs and tight squeezes.  If it wasn’t located at mile 17 of my day, it might have been entertaining.
I completed the maze and did three more miles to a camp site at a creek crossing near a huge patch of germs.  There were no other hikers there so I spent the night in my tent alone in the forest.","

Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594898,"I was 4 miles from Boiling Springs, less than two hours of hiking, so I decided to hike into town for a real breakfast rather than a protein bar breakfast.  
My hike started through a forest with easy ascents a descents.  I was surprised by the number of sink holes I passed along the hike.  As I neared Boiling Springs, the trail exited the woods and I found myself hiking along a cornfield.  The terrain was completely flat.  The trail was suddenly “crowded” with day hikers, walkers, joggers, and people walking dogs.  I guess they liked the flat trail, but I couldn’t help but wonder why they chose this spot to experience the Appalachian Trail because it didn’t exactly connect with nature.  Just past the corn field was a CAFO (confined animal feeding operation).  It was about a half mile away, but the smell was over powering.  The fields are owned by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC).  I assume the CAFO is not owned by the ATC.
As I hiked into Boiling Springs I stopped at the ATC regional office.  I asked about a good place to eat and I asked about the sinkholes.  The volunteer looks me they weren’t sink holes, but charcoal puts used long ago to make charcoal for the iron furnace.  He also pointed me to a great breakfast spot and said I could leave my pack at the ATC center.  
After a great meal, I hiked on to the next town, Carlisle, where I planned to stay in a hotel so I could wash my clothes and leave behind some things from my pack.  I had packed too quickly and was carrying extra weight.  I was hoping to leave some stuff at the hotel to pick up after my hike.  ","

Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594899,"Day 5Rain was predicted for all day and all night.  So much for getting dry clothes.  Most thru-hikers were taking a zero day.  I decided to hike 18 miles in the rain and stay at a hotel in Duncannon.  It rained steady mist of he day.  I folded up one of my hiking poles and used my umbrella.  I still got wet but it kept the rain off my glasses - for the most part.  I only saw one other hiker all day, when I stopped at a shelter to eat and rest.  When I stopped hiking, the rain, the wind, and my wet clothes made me cold, so I didn’t rest long.  I did meet about six trail runners.  I wasn’t sure if they liked the rain because it kept them from getting hot, or if they ran the trail every Sunday regardless of the weather. When I reached the road to Duncannon there was a sign with a number to call for a ride to the Red Carpet Inn.  I looked at the trail map and saw I was going to hike right past the Doyle Hotel in town.  That was probably a mistake.  Duncannon was a sad town that I think has seen better days - I hope it has seen better days.  The Doyle cost $25 per night and was probably over priced.  I decided to call the Ref Carpet Inn.  They picked me up and took me to a real hotel.  I got in 18 miles and got to dry my clothes and shoes at the end of the day.","

Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594901,"Day 6I got a ride back to the trail in Duncannon.  I walked to Subway for breakfast before heading out of town and up the mountain.   I met several thru hikers.  The trail in Pennsylvania has a reputation for having dried up streams.  The rain took care of that.  The rain also made all of the rock surfaces wet.  Big sections of the trail were along the crest of the mountain.  Stepping from rock to rock was a little slow because I never knew which ones would be slippery.  Later, walking at a fast pace on an easy part of the trail, I stepped on a flat rock that was very slippery.  I knew I was going down face first and I could do nothing about it.  My forehead hit another rock and my glasses were smashed into my face.  Nothing was broken except my pride.  I got up, brushed off as much mud as I could and hiked on.  Then I realized my forehead was bleeding.  It didn’t hurt much, but it wouldn’t stop bleeding. I carry a bandanna to wipe sweat so it doesn’t get in my eyes, but it came in handy to keep the blood from getting in my eyes as well.  The weather was perfect.  The sky was clear, although I was mostly in the shade.  I did 18 miles.  I could have done more, but there was a great campsite along a ridge with a view.  One thru hikerhad already set up camp.  His trail name is Aladdin, and I had met him at lunch.  He is from Oregon.  He thru hiked the Pacific Crest Trail last year.  I did wonder how someone had the time and money to spend 5 or 6 months in two consecutive years hiking trails, but I didn’t ask.  I did ask if he mind if I joined him at the campsite.  He said he did not.  He had a couple friends that were going to camp there as well.  Later, Packman and his wife showed up, as well as Taser.  She was hiking with her father, trail name Recliner.  She said we’d see why later. Before Recliner arrived, Taser set up the two-person tent, hung the food bag, set up a camp chair, disappeared back down the trail, and returned with her father’s backpack.  Twenty minutes later, Recliner walked into camp, sat down and leaned back in the camp chair, and Taser brought him his supper.  I decided I liked his style of hiking.  As we sat around the unlit fire ring, eating and talking, Aladdin showed me an app he uses called Guthook.  It uses GPS while on airplane mode and shows your location and details about the trail.  We had a strong signal on top of the mountain so in my tent, before going to sleep, I downloaded Guthook, although it was way more than my standard limit of $.99 for an app.","

Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594907,"Day 7I looked at my new app and saw a stream 1 mike ahead, all downhill.  I decided to break camp and hike to the water to eat breakfast.  There was a great campsite near the stream and I kind of wished I had hiked another mile yesterday to camp there, but then I wouldn’t have had this cool app.  I ate breakfast, filled my water bottles, and hiked in.The trail ascended along a gently sloping crushed gravel path.  After quite a while, I realized I hadn’t seen a white blaze in quite a distance.  Should I hike forward and look for them or hike back and look for them. Wait!  I had a new cool app!  I looked at the map of the trail and the blue dot that was me and they were not together.  I was a long way from the trail.  I retraced my steps and the blue dot slowly moved closer to the trail.  By the time the blue dot intersected the Trail, I was almost back at my breakfast spot.  I had seen a double blaze, which means “Pay close attention, the trail is changing in some way,” but I didn’t notice the trail veered left and the gravel path went right.  I added 2 miles to my day’s hike.I came across Yellow Spring Village site, an abandoned mining area.  It was wooded but grassy.  Someone had set up stone “chairs” with flat seats and backs.  It was to much luxury to pass up, so I had lunch.  While I ate, three ladies stopped by.  They were section hiking the AT with day hikes.  One of the ladies husband dropped them in the morning and then dive to a road crossing ahead of them, picked them up and drove them to a hotel.  That also seemed like a great way to hike the AT.
After lunch I hiked on; I passed the three lady day hikers as they were eating their lunch. Late in the afternoon I came to a small wooden bridge over a small stream.  It would have been uneventful, except a recent storm had clogged the footbridge with branches and leaves so the creek left its bed on the other side of the bridge.  In fact the stream was a couple hundred yards wide and the trail for the next couple hundred yards was under at jest a foot of water.  This was not one of those cases where you stepped from rock to rock.  I had three choices. (1) Walk through the water with my shoes on and then hike with wet shoes and socks.  (2) Take off my shoes and socks and walk through the water barefoot.  (3) Take off my shoes and socks and wear Crocks through the water.  Option 3 would have been a great option, if I had Crocks.  I took off my shoes and socks and stepped into the water.  It was cold, but not unbearable.  The trail under the water was sometimes muddy, sometimes rocky, and sometimes covered in slippery, tangled tree roots.  The biggest challenge was cleaning and drying my feet at the other end before putting on my shoes and socks.  I used my bloody bandanna for that.On the other side of the water, was a man waiting for the three lady hikers. He was hiking in to meet them but turned back at the water.  I told him they were quite a distance back but we’re headed this way.  He was being overwhelmed by mosquitos, so I dug out my insect repellent fir him.  While I was hiking, the mosquitos didn’t seem bad at all, but when I stopped to put on my shoes, they were swarming.  He wondered if the ladies could get through the water.  I said they really had no choice.I hiked on through a Swatara State Park, under I-81, and up a mountain to a campsite.  No one was camping there.  I set up my tent, hung my bear bag, cleaned up, and ate supper.  I like to hang the food bag before I eat because sometimes it takes a while.  Then if it is starting to get dark after I eat, I just put all the food stuff into the bag and house it up, suspended between two trees.Just as I was crawling into my tent, a group of thru hikers rolled into camp. It was the group I had run into my first couple days out.  Suddenly my wilderness campsite was transformed into a small village.  It wasn’t too long before they had set up camp, eaten, and were preparing for bed.  They had all walked through the water with their hiking shoes and were trying to figure out the best way to dry their shoes.","

Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594909,"Day 8I had camped at another dry, mountain top campsite, so I decided to once again pack up and hike to a stream for breakfast.  The talk on the trail was all about the upcoming 501 shelter that had running water and a shower.  It was near the road, Hiway 501, which meant they delivered pizza.  I wasn’t interested in pizza, but I did think I might stop there, have my cooked meal for lunch instead of supper, and take a rest.  It was fairly luxurious as far as shelters go.  It had four walls and a door and a skylight.  None of that kept the rodents out.  A chipmunk came and went as I ate lunch.I hiked most of that afternoon with Chad, from Texas.  He had heard of a campsite by a stream that was near a swimming hole.  That sounded like a great way to end the day, so we both decided to head there. There was a shirt side trail to a view not far from the campsite.  We Amit past it by but we heard a couple hikers there scream, “Holy sh**” a phrase that makes no sense to me, but certainly made me curious.  We got to the look out, which was a drop off of about 15 feet to a rocky outcropping and then another drop of hundreds of feet.  Down on the rocky outcropping were two black rat snakes coiled together in the sun.  Inches from them were two timber rattlers.  Near by were two more timber rattlers.  I guess it was one of the few sunny spots around.  I have two fears in life - heights and snakes - and there they both were right in front of me.  Although I was far enough from the snakes and the edge that I stared for a long time.We found the stream, we set up camp, and we followed a blue blazed trail down to an old reservoir.  The stream ran into the reservoir and came out the other side like a waterfall and tumbled down the ravine.  There was a rope hanging from a tree at the edge.  It was perfect for swinging out and dropping into the water.  The water, by the way, was numbing my cold.  We each dropped in twice.  It wasn’t the kind of water you paddled around on after you dropped into it, but it quickly got rid of the day’s sweat.  We walked back up to our camp, ate supper, shared stories, and crawled into our tents.  I was on a flat area between two converging streams.  I thought the noise might keep me awake.  It did not.","

Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595365,"Day 9 and 10The last day of my hike, I had 19 miles to hike into Hamburg where my wife, Izzie, was going to meet me.  Chad left camp a bit before me and I didn’t see him again because he took a side trail to the Heart and Sole Hostel (pun intended).  I always have mixed emotions about the last day of a hike.  I get to see my wife, I get to sleep in a real bed, take a shower, and eat real food.  But I know I will miss being in the forest and all of its sights and sounds.  In a normal year I would have several more days of hiking ahead of me, but this is not a normal year.  I am running for State Representative, and that makes everything outside of the realm of normal.  (Dalenowlin.com)  That means I need to head back to Indiana and get back to knocking on doors. I was hoping that I could hike a few miles tomorrow with my wife and without my pack.  I rethought that idea as I descended down to town and the Schuylkill River.  It was the toughest descent of the whole trip.  If the ascent on the other side was anything like this descent, my wife would not be a happy hiker.  But, I made it into town, met my wife, ate a real supper, and slept in a real bed.
The next day, the weather was great. We drove to the downtown part of Hamburg and had breakfast at a local diner.  My wife was interested in hiking some of the trail, I was thrilled to do a few more miles.  We found a parking area and hiked up to the Pulpit overlook.  The ascent was not nearly as tough as the descent had been and I got in 4 extra miles.  It was a great way to end my latest connection with the trail.  Hopefully I will be back for a couple days in July on my way to DC to hike through Maryland, but that is an entry for another day.","
