This is part of a journal entry I wrote last year on my way to a camp out at Grayson Highlands in VA:""I never thought getting outdoors could be healing, but that's what I felt this weekend. Driving up to Grayson Highlands State Park, I rolled down my window to get some fresh air. There was a slight breeze in the air. I could literally feel the stress melt away and the life come back to me. I felt a peace I hadn't felt in a long time. I stopped at the ranger station to take in the view. I can remember feeling so fortunate to be able to be witnessing such a spectacular view. The trees are starting to change color and, although they weren't in peak season, I could see the amazing beauty of the mixture of oranges, reds, yellows and greens as they started to paint the landscape.""",,"Grayson Highlands, Va","Sep 01, Sun",0
Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/471702,"I don't really remember how I came across the book ""Wild"" by Cheryl Strayed. What I do remember after starting to read it was that I couldn't put it down. Something inside me clicked. And although her booked described her hike of the Pacific Coast Trail, it led me to AT.   That is when my desire to hike the AT started.I had been researching, reading, and watching everything I could about the AT. Eventually, I came across """"Becoming Odyessa"" by Jennifer Pharr Davis. Here is a journal entry I wrote after reading some of her book:""I just read a short section of a book called ""Becoming Odyessa"" by Jennifer Pharr Davis. She hit it right on the head when she wrote about hiking the trail:'I feel like I'm meant to...I mean, I feel I was made to...I think that I'm supposed to hike the AT......Appalachian Trail came to me three years ago, and since it entered my mind, not a day goes by when I don't think about the trail. It's not like I chose to hike the trail, but more like it chose me.""""...so the trail is a calling?""""...yeah...a calling.""'My first reaction to reading that was shock! That's it!! That's what I'm feeling! I didn't want to call it an obsession, because that's not what it felt like. It wasn't a fad, because it wasn't going to fade after time. It was something I felt I had to do. How do I explain to people what I'm feeling; what I'm going through; why I want to do this?""...so the trail is a calling?""""...yeah...a calling""",,View Entry,"Jun 01, Sun",0
Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479807,"The Appalachian Trail is one of the longest continuously marked footpath in the world, measuring roughly 2,180 miles in length. The Trail goes through fourteen states along the crests and valleys of the Appalachian mountain range from the southern terminus at Springer Mountain, Georgia, to the Trail’s northern terminus at Katahdin, Maine.Known as the “A.T.,” it has been estimated that 2-3 million people visit the Trail every year and about 1,800–2,000 people attempt to “thru-hike” the Trail. People from across the globe are drawn to the A.T. for a variety of reasons: to reconnect with nature, to escape the stress of city life, to meet new people or deepen old friendships, or to experience a simpler life.The A.T. was completed in 1937 and is a unit of the National Park System. The A.T. is managed under a unique partnership between the public and private sectors that includes, among others, the National Park Service (NPS), the USDA Forest Service (USFS), an array of state agencies, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, and 31 local Trail-maintaining clubs.Fun Facts•The Trail is roughly 2,180 miles long, passing through 14 states.•Thousands of volunteers contribute roughly 220,000 hours to the A.T. every year. •More than 250 three-sided shelters exist along the Trail. •Virginia is home to the most miles of the Trail (about 550), while West Virginia is home to the least (about 4). •Maryland and West Virginia are the easiest states to hike; New Hampshire and Maine are the hardest. •The total elevation gain of hiking the entire A.T. is equivalent to climbing Mt. Everest 16 times. •The A.T. is home to an impressive diversity of plants and animals. Some animals you may see include black bears, moose, porcupines, snakes, woodpeckers, and salamanders. Some plants you may encounter include jack-in-the-pulpit, skunk cabbage, and flame azalea. Hikers•About 2 to 3 million visitors walk a portion of the A.T. each year.•The A.T. has hundreds of access points and is within a few hours drive of millions of Americans, making it a popular destination for day-hikers.•“Thru-hikers” walk the entire Trail in a continuous journey. “Section-hikers” piece the entire Trail together over years. “Flip-floppers” thru-hike the entire Trail in discontinuous sections to avoid crowds, extremes in weather, or start on easier terrain. •1 in 4 who attempt a thru-hike successfully completes the journey •Most thru-hikers walk north, starting in Georgia in spring and finishing in Maine in fall, taking an average of 6 months. •Foods high in calories and low in water weight, such as Snickers bars and Ramen Noodles, are popular with backpackers, who can burn up to 6,000 calories a day. •Hikers usually adopt “trail names” while hiking the Trail. They are often descriptive or humorous. Examples are “Eternal Optimist,” “Thunder Chicken,” and “Crumb-snatcher"".",,View Entry,"Aug 01, Fri",0
Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/471919,"I was going to wait to start my trail journal until I actually set foot on the AT this September. But as I went on overnight camping trip to test out some gear, I realize this journey is going to begin loooong before I even see my first white blaze.Recently, I had a couple of days off and was itching to try out some new gear. Luckily, a bushcraft group I belong to was having their summer gathering in the Uwharrie National Forest this weekend. I told myself I was only going to bring my backpack - everything I would need as if I was hiking the trail. In the past, I have been known to show up with my Xterra stuffed full of gear, food, utensils, chairs, etc. Yep, practically the kitchen sink. (I'm sure if it would have fit, I would have taken it.). This time, I told myself, ONLY the pack....well, it is 3 days, maybe a chair...oh, and a folding table would be good....oh, and a cooler for my creamer for my coffee, I'll need that...it turned out to be about 1/3 the capacity of my truck. I know, I know, it was more than ""just my pack"" but it is still better than previous outings.The campsite is relatively remote and about 1/4 of a mile straight downhill and then down a small hiking trail. Not a bad hike but you don't want to do it more than a couple of times in this North Carolina heat (especially at my age, haha).I have this habit of ""aw, just throw it in the car."" Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it.   Apparently, this also applies to my backpack as well. While at home, I would pack and repack my gear in my backpack ensuring I had everything I would need. The weight would fluctuate between 22-24 pounds. As I'm getting ready to load up my truck, I go to grab my pack and it has to weigh 40 lbs! I'm sure this was because of the added food and water. Right? Not so much...I had add a few things I thought I would need for the weekend. This included my bushcraft knife, my Garmin gps, 3 bandanas, three pairs of hiking pants, one pair of shorts...you get the idea...I can remember telling myself I won't need these on the trail but somehow they still snuck into my pack. I'm sure it was like a scene from Toy Story where as soon as I turned my back, the toys (or in this case, gear) snuck their way into my backpack.I have read books and watched videos from fellow hikers explaining how to pack a backpack. For the most part, I have tried to follow their advice. Starting with my sleeping bag on the bottom to give my pack a good wide base. Add the heavier things in the middle, such as tent, cook set, air pad and food in the middle, and lighter things on top, i.e., clothes. I also decided, based on a YouTube video, to not put my clothes in a bag but to use them to fill in all the spaces left along the sides, etc. Sounds like a good plan, right?   Well....as I trying to get my tent out, my panties, socks and bras are all falling out of my pack. I was trying to be discreet with no luck. I finally get the tent out and set up, and eventually my gear makes it into the tent. As I am tossing my gear into my tent, it occurred to me just exactly what I have brought - along with my pack which contains clothes, tent, a sleep system, etc, I had also brought gear I wanted to test out - two more sleeping pads, another sleeping bag, two down jackets and a nylon/fleece jacket (keep in mind it is August in North Carolina), 3 bushcraft knives (for whatever reason), 3 -.5L bottles of water, etc.   honestly, I don't know what I was thinking...it was 90 degrees during the day and 75 degrees in the evening. I soon realized I was not going to gear test the down or fleece jackets and the other sleeping bag.   As other people arrived and needed help bringing stuff down to the campsite, I saw it as an opportunity to haul stuff back up.The gear that was on the absolute ""must test"" list was the REI footprint I had purchased for my tent and the sleep system I was planning to use on the trail. This included a foam layer, the Thermarest Neoair Venture pad, the Big Agnes Roxy Ann sleeping bag and a cocoon silk liner.   Also, it was the first time my Osprey Aura 65 would be on my back for longer than the weigh in on the bathroom scale.The day flew by and soon it was time for bed. I began setting up my bed - I unrolled the foam pad, blew up the airpad and got out my sleeping bag and liner.   I was now ready for some comfortable sleep. I went to take my contact lenses out and realized I had left my lens solution in my truck. I also realized I had failed to bring an extra pair of lenses so I couldn't just throw the ones I was wearing away. I remembered to bring my glasses but can only wear my glasses for a day before they begin to give me a headache. I had no other choice but to soak my contacts in plain water overnight and hope for the best in the morning. (Turned out to work fine. No issues, but I wouldn't do this again unless in an emergency.)I finished getting ready for bed and laid down on my new sleep system. I tried to roll on my side and I was surprised how much noise my sleeping pad made. Crinkle, crinkle....and the sound seemed to be amplified in the silence of the forest. My pad was also very narrow so that if I tried to sleep on my back, my elbows would rest on the tent floor. And....I'm sleeping on a small slope! I knew my sleeping pad was not designed for the sleeping bag I was using so I had merely placed my bag on top of the pad. Needless to say, with the small slope, every time I moved, my bag would end up down the slope. Eventually it cooled off enough that I needed to climb into my liner and sleeping bag. This helped eliminate the bag sliding downhill. I eventually dozed off...I bolt awake!! What was that sound?! There was something stomping around in the area behind my tent. I immediately thought BEAR!!! I listened for a few minutes but then it stopped. I must have dozed off again because I woke to the sound of stomping again. Another couple of minutes, it stopped. It wasn't until the morning that I learned it was one of the other campers who was having leg cramps trying to walk them off.I usually don't have a problem falling asleep but for some reason every little thing was keeping me awake. Lessons learned:1. Sleeping on slope is no fun.2. Don't ever, ever, forget my contact lens solution again.3. The liner and sleeping bag work great together.4. The sleeping bag on top of the sleeping pad does not.5. Fleece and down jackets are not needed in NC in August. (Although I think I already knew that...)6. Stick to the 1 pack rule. Don't bring 3 air pads, 2 sleeping bags, 3 jackets, etc.
7. Two words...clothes bag. I can see why other hikers say to test your gear before you hit the trail. This could be a long process...",,"Uwharrie National Forest, NC","Aug 21, Thu",0
Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/472186,"I recently read this in Sandman 69's 2014 trail journal. I think it will be advice I will visit time and time again.""Let me leave you with these wise words from Warren Doyle, the Director/Instructor of the Appalachian Trail Institute which I attented before I began my journey.1) Walking the entire Appalachian Trail is not recreation. It is an education and a job.2) Walking the entire Appalachian Trail is not 'going on a hike'. It is a challenging task - a journey with deeper ramifications. Are you willing to accept them and learn from them?3) Don't fight the Trail. You have to flow with it. Be cooperative with the Trail, neither competitive nor combative.4) Don't expect the Trail to respect or be sensitive to your domestic comfort level and desire (and past habits) to control your environment. In your avoidance of discomfort, you may become more uncomfortable. You can't make a mountain any less steep; a hot summer afternoon any cooler; a cold morning any warmer; and, daylight any longer. But you can actually. How?5) Time, distance, terrain, weather, and the Trail itself cannot be changed. You have to change. Don't waste any of your energy complaining over things you have no control over. Instead, look to yourself and adapt your mind, heart, body and soul to the Trail. Remember, you will be a guest in someone else's house the entire journey.6) The Trail knows neither prejudice nor discrimination. Don't expect any favors from the Trail. The Trail is inherently hard. Everything has to be earned. The Trail is a trial.7) Leave your cultural 'level of comfort' at home. Reduce your material wants while concentrating on your physical and spiritual needs.8) ""The more I know, the less I need."" Yes, one can wear one t-shirt the entire journey; you don't have to take any showers; don't need to cook your meals; one does not need a roof and four walls around them at night; you don't have to carry a canteen of water with you all the time.9) It is far better, and less painful, to learn to be a smart hiker rather than a strong hiker.10) Leave your emotional fat at home as well. Feel free to laugh, and to cry, and to feel lonely, and to feel afraid, and to feel socially irresponsible, and to feel foolish, and (most importantly) to feel free. Relive your childhood and play the game of the Trail. Roll with the punches and learn to laugh in the shadow of adversity. Be always optimistic - things could always be worse; don't become mired in the swamp of sorrow. Don't blame your discomfort or depression on the Trail or the weather, but look at yourself for not being able to adapt. The more afraid you are, the heavier your pack will be.Warren Doyle, 34,000+ miles hikedhttp://www.warrendoyle.com/ATI.html""Thank you Warren Doyle and Sandman 69 for sharing this wisdom.",,View Entry,"Aug 22, Fri",0
Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/474211,"I've had a chance to get a couple of hikes in recently while vacationing in Sedona, AZ. The weather is hot, the altitude higher and the hikes are straight up. It has definitely been challenging. I do believe these hikes, although short, are beneficial in lots of ways. I can feel my endurance and strength have increased; I'm not as winded as I would have been a year ago; and my knees seemed to be much happier at the end of the day. I'm still carrying around a lot more physical weight than I want to but I am feeling stronger and more fit with every step I take.   Hopefully, the weight loss will come too.I did some scampering up sheer sandstone mountains today. It was a little freaky at first but, once I determined my boots were gripping just fine, it got to be more of a playground. We also did some climbing up and down boulders today and found myself sad when it was time to move on. I hope I'll be one of those that think the Mahoosuc Notch and Arm are fun...lol, we'll see...I have also been hiking with a pack consistently now and feel that getting around with it is getting easier. My balance is better but I know I have a long way to go. I recently got to watch my cousins' son do parkour training. Google it. It is some crazy stuff! According to Apex Movement on the web, Parkour training is ""is a method of training your body and mind to overcome obstacles with speed and efficiency. However, the practice of parkour also includes many challenges that need adaptability, creativity, and strategy. Parkour athletes...use movements such as vaulting, running, climbing, swinging, and balancing to pass over, under, and through obstacles.""   It looked like so much fun, I really wanted to try it. I probably would have ended up in traction but it looked like fun. I think I'll look into it when I get home.As far as my AT hike, I am having a tough time deciding on whether I want to be SOBO or NOBO. I think seeing Katahdin at the end would be how I would want my hike to end....but...I will be living in SC (only 3+ hours from Springer Mountain) so ending in GA would be so close to home.   Starting in GA would allow me to hike with more thru hikers around since right now I seem to have a tough time hiking alone. But starting in ME would allow me to have more of a support group closer to me during the months that could be the hardest.....I guess I have a while to think about it more....",,"Sedona, AZ","Sep 14, Sun",0

I'm so excited I can hardly stand it! It will be my first official AT miles. Has anyone else had this problem? I am restless at work, having problems concentrating, and I can't seem to get a good nights sleep. I keep packing and unpacking my gear. All I can think about is the weekend. Do I have everything? Do I have too much? Not enough? Do I take this? Leave that? I still need a few things - a rock bag and line. (I've never tried to hang my food. I think the first attempt will be video worthy. Haha, could be good for some laughs!) I was going to try to stay at a hostel one night for the experience factor but one won't return my call and the other is under renovations. Guess it'll be the campground for me. My little trangia stove arrived so I'll be trying that out too. Oh yeah, I need fuel...you get the idea, right? My thoughts are moving so fast, I'm not sure I've written them all down.   I'm one of those people (old) that writes everything down so I don't forget anything and, then when I get out to the woods, realize that I forgot important things like toilet paper. Yep, that's me! Lol....is it Thursday yet?

Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/475235,"I was awakened at 6:30 this morning by the smell of freshly brewed coffee. (Mmmm...coffee). I slept well at the Woodchuck Hostel and would highly recommend it anyone looking for a comfy bed to sleep in. Despite the early morning the day before (work) and the late bedtime (because I was enjoying just hanging out with two other hikers staying at the hostel), I felt pretty good. The temperature was a little chilly and I tried to linger in bed just a few minutes more. What?! Get up, I told myself, you're going to hike the AT today! My excitement got the better of me and I was out of bed by 6:40. Woodchuck had prepared blueberry waffles, which complimented his coffee wonderfully. Pacman soon joined us and we spent the morning talking about how nice the hike I was doing today was going to be. Despite their reassurances, I still had my doubts. I hadn't hiked 11.5 miles in one day since my twenties. Even if it was easy terrain, that distance seemed daunting. The longest any of my prehikes had been was (maybe) 5.5 miles. But I was determined to succeed. I told myself, how am I going to do the entire AT if I can't conquer the easy 11.5 miles of it?! I had weighed my daypack at the hostel with my Nikon SLR and, not including my monopod and a bottle of water, it came to 15 lbs. A respectable weight to carry, I think, for a daypack and my first time on the trail. But, eventually, I talked myself out of taking my SLR. The added weight just wasn't worth it. (Turns out, leaving my SLR was a good move. There were no vistas to be seen and the photo ops weren't anything my cell phone couldn't handle.)Woodchuck shuttled me to the drop off point, McQueens Gap. I was then going to walk north and end up back at the hostel. Did I mention it was my 50th birthday? Woodchuck took my picture by my first white blaze after I had donned the ""50th"" t-shirt my brother had sent me. I am the youngest of 6. When my oldest brother turned 50, my mother had given him a shirt at his party that had the number 50 on it flanked with 2 stars. Since then, the shirt has been passed on to each of us just prior to our 50th birthday. Yep, my turn! Woodchuck then hiked with me a short distance. I think he thought he was holding me up, but honestly, I thought it was cool that I had a thru hiker walking with me the first time I set foot on the trail. He said he needed to get his AT trail ""fix"". Although I didn't have one mile under my belt, I somehow knew exactly what he meant.I don't know if the terrain was that easy or if I was running on pure adrenaline, but I hiked the first two miles in 45 minutes. (That's fast for me - I'm short). I'm sure it was both. I figured I need to average about two miles per hour to allow me time to take the pictures I wanted and still make it back in time to get to Grayson Highlands before nightfall. I really wanted to avoid putting up my tent in the dark (although, it might gave been good practice for the AT). There were some good hills that had me questioning if I was 50 or 80. Also, being alone on the trail, I could hear every little twig snapping. Several squirrels had me convinced I was about to encounter a bear. They were having fun at my expense. Evil little critters, I'm sure they were laughing at me! As it is now fall, acorns are constantly falling from the trees. Several times, one would land so close to me that I was sure those evil little squirrels were trying to hit me with them. It got to be so often, that I started to say out loud, ""Ha! You missed me again!"" Just then I would hear rustling in the leaves and I would be back on bear patrol, followed by squirrel laughter off in the distance.Overall, it was a great hike in so many ways. First and foremost, I had fun. The squirrels and the acorns had me on my toes. The terrain was relatively easy and beautiful, but at times, challenging. The weather was fantastic. I even got to experience a state line. Yep, I hiked in Tennessee AND Virginia today. Very cool. It took me less than 6 hours to do 11.5 miles, not bad for an old lady!","McQueen's Gap

Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/478686,"Has it really been nearly two months since my last journal entry? UGH! That would mean it has been almost two months since I've been on any trail. My husband and I recently moved to South Carolina. Prior to the move, my husband had already started his new job and was staying in an extended stay hotel. I was still in North Carolina packing up the house. On his days off, my husband would come back to North Carolina, load up the trailer and haul a load to South Carolina. Obviously a move like this would take several weeks. Definitely not the most organized move I have ever been a part of. Although we are finally in our new home, we can't find anything! There are boxes everywhere, including storage, and we still haven't been able to find our dishes. There is a running joke that the last box we unpack will have the dishes in it. As life begins to settle down again, the trail is calling. I purposefully took my backpacks with me in the car for fear of them getting lost in the move. I see now that it was a good move on my part.

My legs were stiff and tight, and I just couldn't loosen up...Bad...are you sensing how the rest of the hike went?   Bad...The weather turned out to be perfect for hiking so at least I wasn't freezing. I did learn some valuable lessons today. I felt EVERY unnecessary ounce I was carrying - weight IS as important as everyone says it is. (I always have to learn things the hard way!). Eating, even if it is snacking, can give me a boost of energy - replenishing nutrients will keep me from getting headaches later (did I mention I have to learn things the hard way?) I need to find a less constrictive base layer pant for cool-cold weather - proper circulation will help, period. (Did I mention that I have to learn...yep, you guessed it). AND Lastly, three months off the trail makes me feel like I'm back to square one....One step forward, two steps back.... All in all, not a terrible hike; it just didn't turn out the way I wanted it to. I just have to keep putting one foot in front of the other and it will all work out.

Now Shutterbug-ilocks, let's call her Bug for the sake of this story, was feeling cooped up. She had a new job to deal with, unpacking to do, and every day house chores that needed tending to. But Bug could hear a voice in the distance calling her to the trail. ""Get out and hike. You'll feel better,"" the voice was telling her. The voice was trying to entice Bug to ignore things that needed to be done, to get out and have some fun. Bug, the procrastinator that she was, said ""you know, voice, you're right! It's time to have some fun."" So Bug loaded up her Osprey and headed out to the trail. Now the first trail she tried was on the AT. This hike seemed to be all uphill, and in the end, had her questioning whether she should take up needlepoint instead. (See journal entry on 12/27/14). ""Oh,"" she said, ""I'm going to need to get into better shape if I want to do this hike. For now, this hike toooo hard."" Then she decided she would meet up with the Trail Dames of South Carolina and attend their hike around Ninety Six National Historic Site. It was a beautiful day! The weather was perfect, the trail was flat, and the company was awesome! Enjoying the day while taking in history, the hike was over before Bug knew it. ""Darn,"" she said, ""I could do this all day!"" (We even went out to lunch afterwards. Hiking AND food! I look forward to doing more hikes with the Trail Dames. I recommend them to any lady looking to hike in a group). But back to the story....Bug then decided she would try one of the hikes organized by Outdoor Club South. (They list the hike's distance and degree of difficulty so you can be sure you're not getting in over your head.). She picked a 5.5 mile hike with a moderate degree of difficulty. Middle of the road. Seemed safe enough. She met the group at Paris Mountain State Park in Greenville. Beautiful day, nice long hike with lots of inclines to get her heart pumping and lots of declines to catch her breath. The last mile and a half was all uphill giving Bug a good workout. She made it to the top (which was good because that's where her car was). She was tired and winded but felt like she was getting stronger with every step.

Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480781,"I have recently seen in other trail journals, several hikers answer the question ""Why do you want to hike the AT?"" I've tried several times to answer that question myself - what is my reason for wanting to hike the trail? For a long time, all I could come up with was ""why not?,"" or ""sounds like fun."" They never seemed to be good enough answers in my mind. I guess I never put a lot of thought into why, only that I knew I wanted to do it. There had to be something more to wanting to spend 6 months of my life eating pop tarts and snickers bars, sleeping in a tent, battling bugs, weather and rocks, basically, something more than ""jus cuz."" There just had to be a better answer. I went hiking today with my new friend, Julie, who is as excited about hiking the trail as I am. I asked her the question - ""why?"" Her answer was simple, ""I'm ready for another adventure."" Bam!! It hit me like a ton of bricks! Boy, did it get me thinking! I asked myself ""Self,"" I said, ""what adventure have I been on lately?"" Sadly, I couldn't think of one. My husband and I went to Italy, but even that was 5 or 6 years ago.

I have watched the sunrise on top of Mt Fuji, I have hiked the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu, and I have stood atop Half Dome in Yosemite National Park.

Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481093,"I found this while reading Lollygagger's trail journal from 2008. I thought it was funny so I thought I would share. Thank you Sharon!Top 10 ways to determine if someone is a thru-hiker:10. They avoid having pennies, dimes, nickels, quarters as if it were a deadly disease.9. They show blatant disregard for signs requesting them to ""leave backpacks here.""8. When introducing themselves they offer completely untraditional names/words and even phrases, such as ""The Lollygagger,"" ""Tumbleweed"" or ""Bear Bait.""7. In resturants they order more than one entree at a time, then eat every last bit, then order dessert and eat that all too.6. In grocery and convenient stores they don't check the nutritional information or price, but rather lift the item to see how much it weighs.5. No matter where or when you see them, they are always wearing the exact same clothes.4. They express glee and delight when they spot a drinking fountain, bathroom with indoor plumbing, and especially, a garbage can. 3.Their feet (in addition to being foul smelling) appear aged, dirty and swollen and they sport duct tape, bandaids and mole skin as if it were tatoos.2. When they remove their boots or step close in an enclosed space, a most utterly foul and pungent odor will permeate the room and make it uninhabitable within mere seconds. 1. Even on a bright sunny,blue sky day ,they can be seen walking around town wearing nothing but a raincoat and rain pants( a sure sign they are doing their laundry) copyright: Sharon Mammoser 05/24/2008I'm really excited about tomorrow. Certificate and I are hitting the trail with our packs on for the first time. I will admit though, I've taken some things out to lighten it some. I know the 28-30 lb weight is something I'm going to have to build up to. For now I believe my pack weighs about 15-20 lbs. I don't have a scale to know for sure. I really excited to be doing this because I feel it's one more step forward to increasing my mental and physical fitness for the trail. I'll let you know how it goes tomorrow.- Shutterbug","

Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481308,"Certificate and I set out to spend the day hiking and surveying possible sites for a Trail Dames overnighter. The weather was brisk but not bad. Eventually, it warmed up and it turned out to be a gorgeous day. Certificate had the awesome idea of bringing our hammocks along to give us a place to sit or lay down while we rested and had lunch. I saw it as an opportunity to actually practice hanging up my hammock. Ok, here's the story...I'm a tenter. I own a hammock but have never slept in it (even for a nap). I've had it for at least a year now and I'm sure I have only strung it up myself once. I have a friend that has used it more than I have. But...everyone I know swears by them. As I am getting older, sleeping on the ground looks less and less appealing to me.   So....out comes the hammock. Certificate had hers up loooong before mine was even out of the bag. Leveling it off for this rookie was taking a lot of time. The straps I had weren't allowing me to adjust it enough to get it level. Certificate had atlas straps. She was up and done in no time. I think I will invest in some atlas straps and whoopie slings. I have to say it was pretty comfy. I do think I would need some sort of behind the knee support and a bug net but all-in-all, I liked it. I am a side sleeper so it may take some getting use too. I could have easily taken a nap but I do snore a wee bit, and I didn't want to scare off my new hiking friend so soon. I was going to set up a tarp above it too but, silly me, forgot my ridge line cord. See, this is why we test gear BEFORE we set out on our thru hike. Just to make sure we have all the pieces. I like the phrase ""Every day should be an adventure!"" What do you think?","

Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481450,"A few days ago, I went on a family hike with the Trail Dames. The weather was gorgeous! One of the ladies had brought her daughter, who was 3 1/2 years old. The little girl was so cute! She was so happy to be outside. She would run a few feet ahead and mom would have to bring her back to the group. Then we made her co-leader so she would stay with the rest of the group. It was fun! She did fall a couple of times. She would get so excited, run a little ahead and trip on a root. Crying followed. Mom would pick her up and ensure her that she was ok. The next minute she was off and running again. Ahhhhhh, the energy of a 3-year old! It was my first time leading a hike, so I was constantly looking back to make sure I wasn't walking too fast, too slow, and that I hadn't lost anyone. Honestly, I was soooo nervous. I didn't lose anyone and no one got hurt so I guess it was a success...anyway, as we got to the last turn onto the last section of the trail, I thought we should stop so everyone could catch up and not miss the turn. Everyone soon caught up and and, with a minute or two to catch their breaths, we were ready to start off again. Just then, something odd caught my eye. There was something on a rock and I couldn't tell what it was. It looked like lettering but my brain wasn't registering any words. One of the ladies turned it upside down and the words became clear. ""Focus on the Goal."" Hmmmm...it seemed strange that the rock was not in a more visible place. It was just on the side of the trail among other rocks. And it was situated so the wording was upside down; not easily readable. A few of us took pictures and placed it where other hikers could see it if they were looking. The person who left it will probably always be a mystery. The wording was simple, but the meaning profound.","Paris Mountain State Park

I feel like I have a million things to do before my section hike next month and not enough time to do them, but I am also so anxious for it to be April. I've tried to use my spare time to tinker with gear, research for something lighter, weed out the unnecessary, practice with what I have, pack and repack. Anything to get me a little more prepared for my hike in April.With just a little over two weeks left before we step off Springer, the final gear tests are in full swing. I'm am trying to find the perfect sock combination. Although, at this point, I firmly believe there is no such thing. I love my Darn Tough socks. Love them. But I think the liners I'm using could be improved. I've been using Peds ankle high liners. They may be cheap, but honestly, they work fine. They work well enough but every once in a while the seam along the toe shifts and creates hot spots on my foot. Nothing a little adjusting can't fix, but I know I don't want to be doing that if its raining. So I have been looking for something with less of a seam at the toe. I thought I had found it in a silk pair of liners at REI. Uhhhh, not so much...the silk liner made my Darn Tough sock slide up and down creating worse hot spots and potential blister areas. For now, I guess I'm back to the Peds. Like I said, they work well enough. I recently also purchased a new bottle to hang on the front of my pack. It's a camelbak bottle with a wider opening at the mouth. It's smaller and lighter than the one was using. My arms are too short to be able to reach around and grab a bottle from the side pockets of my pack every time I want a drink. To avoid dehydration headaches, I am trying to drink more while I hike. It just clips to one of the shoulder straps with an S-biner. REI dividends are out so I may use the money to purchase a bladder. I like the ones that allow me attach my Sawyer mini to it. Let me know if you have any thoughts on this...I recently purchased a new tent from my friend, Certificate. She's using a hammock and didn't need this tent anymore. It is the GoLite Imogene UL2 (2 lbs 7 ozs). I think I'm really going to like this tent. It seemed easy enough to set it up (in my living room). I have a Kelty Salida 2 tent which I really like but it weighs 4 lbs 9 ozs! The GoLite saves me 2 lbs 2 ozs in weight! Can't beat that!I also recently purchased a wallet and a case for my phone from Zpacks. I had an REI wallet but I was really only using half of it and was looking for something smaller. The REI wallet weighed in at .7 oz. Not bad, but the Zpacks wallet (.23 ozs) saves me .4 ozs. The phone case weighs .28 ozs.

So I found a Splenda sweetener with French vanilla flavoring in it and added that to the Via. Blech! Nutella in coffee, you ask? Of course I tried it! It was doable, but I'll need to bring a whole jar with me. Darn the bad luck, right? Still not perfect...Next on the list was something for dinner.

I woke up at 6:00 am knowing I need to get up, take a shower, and repack my pack - all before 7:30 when breakfast was being served. We were in a cabin while most other hikers were sleeping in the hostel part of the house. Although it was quiet and the bed was comfortable, I just couldn't sleep. Anticipation perhaps. I don't know. All I know is I tossed and turned in a semi-conscious state most of the night. Thank goodness for breakfast! There was pancakes, scrambled eggs, oatmeal, grits, and most importantly, coffee! I recommend the Hiker Hostel to anyone starting their hike. Great people and well organized. After breakfast, we headed outside. There, we handed our packs to our driver who was standing on the top of a van. He was strapping them down to the roof for the drive to Springer Mountain. With everyone's pack loaded, we climbed into the van, and off we went! The drive took about an hour and we spent this time getting to know our fellow hikers. Everyone, except Certificate and I, was thru hiking. 12 in all. There was such excitement in their voices. I must admit, I was envious. There were two gentlemen from Germany starting the trail today. With introductions complete, everyone settled into the ride. At one point, I noticed how quiet it had gotten in the van. I was wondering if it was because everyone was coming to the realization that they were about to start a hike that was over 2100+ miles, or for some, of a dream coming true. Finally someone broke the awkward silence and soon we were all laughing again. Finally, the driver said, ""ok, we're here,"" and the excitement level spiked again. We all piled out and systematically claimed our backpacks. Several of us left our packs with Mountain Squid, an AT volunteer, and headed up the .9 mile up to the top of Springer Mountain. The weather was amazingly perfect! Sunny, warm and a slight breeze. Perfect hiking weather. It didn't take long to get to the top. We took the standard pictures of both plaques, signed the log, took more pictures and helped others take their pictures. 20 minutes later we headed down to gather our packs and to start our hike. We had decided it would be a short day. Both of us were not sure how we would feel carry full packs so we opted to only do, in all, a 6.5 mile day. When we arrived at the site we both agreed it was a good call. Not to push it too much. We found an awesome site off the trail with a flowing stream right nearby. We spent a couple of hours setting up tents and hammocks, filtering water, relaxing and reading. We also took a look at the distance we want to cover tomorrow. We never did decide how far we want to go. (It's either going to be a longer than we wanted or a shorter than we wanted.). We think we may have one too many days. We think we could reach Neels Gap in three days but we scheduled four. We also spend a few minutes searching for limbs we could use to hang our food bags. It would be my first attempt at hanging a bear bag. I was very pleased it only took me three tosses. We cooked dinner, filtered more water (my first time filtering water too), hung our food and, finally, at 6:30 decided to light a campfire. I made a small one and by 7:30 we both decided to call it a night. I'm sitting waiting for the fire to go out.   Ready for another awesome day tomorrow.

We woke to a cold, foggy, drizzly morning. We took our time eating breakfast and finally hit the trail about 9:30. Neither of us slept very well. Certificate said she was cold because she didn't bring her under quilt. I kept hearing footsteps outside the tent. Hikers joke that when the Army Rangers come up here to train, they try to sneak into your camp without being detected. If that's true and they were in our site, I heard ya - ALL of ya! We were both a little stiff and sore from the day before so loosening up was taking some time. It was a struggle just getting up the shortest of hills. Everyone kept saying the second day was the hardest. I have to agree. We came across a sign that said ""Three Forks."" ""That can't be right...,"" Certificate says. ""We should have camped past that last night..."" Turns out we didn't hike as far as we thought we had the day before. So our easy day just had another two miles added to it. Ugh! Climbs were hard today. It is raining when we got to Hawk Mountain shelter at 12:30. After grabbing a snack, we reviewed our options. The next shelter and water source was 8 miles away. Not an option for us. We could stay at the shelter with all the mice and hikers and sleep like a sardine. Not a great option, but an option. The next camping area was 2 miles away but it didn't have a water source. It was only 1:00. So we loaded up all our water containers and headed out. The ups and downs on the map looked small...deceivingly small. With all the water we were carrying and as tired as we were, those two miles seemed like an eternity. Especially when we thought we were almost at the top and we get there and...we're not...more uphill - ugh... Lol we were feeling our age today. We FINALLY make it to Horse Gap AND...It's still raining. It was a challenge for the both of us, me putting my tent up and Certificate putting her hammock up in the rain. The campsite was near a road which made me very nervous. So I was very happy to see a couple from Missouri we had met on the first day at the Hiker Hostel and again at Hawk Mountain shelter, Old Drum and Ivana Sherpa, coming down the trail. Old Drum said that Ivana indicated that she was ""done for the day,"" so I mentioned that we would love to have company. They agreed and pitched their tent across from mine. Old Drum has walked the AT, the Florida Trail and PCT. Very cool people. With a meal of hot ramen and a cup of hot cocoa, I was ready for bed. It was only 6:30! As I crawl into my sleeping bag, I can hear the rumble off in the distance. Great, here it comes....CRACK! Lightening above our heads. It's pouring rain which should make for a very interesting breakdown of camp in the morning. As I'm looking around, I can see the tent is splattered with mud as high as a foot along the walls and there is a small lake in the vestibule. I just hope I don't float away overnight.","Three Forks

I still don't know what it was, and we never did see anything.   But I know I heard a snort. Back to sleep...Wow, what a day! I woke up late and we were the last to break camp. EVERYTHING was wet and muddy. It was a chore packing up a wet tent, sleeping bag, tarp, poles, and clothes. The toughest part was where to put them; where to put everything so that things that were actually dry stayed dry. I wanted to hang the wet stuff on the outside of my pack but there wasn't enough space for all of it. Finally, I stuffed it all in a trash bag and strapped the bag to the outside of my pack. The water added extra weight to my pack. Ugh! Straight out of camp was the climb of Sassafras Mountain. It was a tough climb for both of us. We were being passed by much younger hikers, even some not much younger than us. Everyone on the trail has been incredibly nice. We even had our first trail magic today at Cooper Gap right before the climb up Justus Mountain. A couple, who we later learn is Pat and Stan, pulls up and asks if we could use some water. I was running low so I said yes. Certificate said no, so they asked her if she would like some Famous Amos cookies instead.   Ummm, yes please! Our first official trail magic! So awesome! Shortly after that, we head up Justus Mountain. Our already tired legs are fighting us all the way up this mountain. We finally drag ourselves into Gooch Shelter around 3:00 pm. There are plenty of people there and we are happy we found a site because they were filling up fast. The sun was still out so I took advantage of it to spread out my tent, footprint and fly to get them to dry.

Aww, I just got them dry....Sure enough, after dinner I could hear the rumbling off in the distance.   It's not long after that I see the first flash of lightening.

I thought it was going to rip my tent up into the air and I would find myself landing in the Land of Oz.The next morning, the weather report was calling for temperatures dipping into the teens. With everything wet, both of us tired, and Certificates without her under quilt, we thought it best we get off the trail.

Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/486791,"I've been home for a few hours now. As I start to go through my gear to clean and repack it all, I am able to reflect on what I took and what worked and what didn't. First, I guess I'll cover the big three. My Big Agnes sleeping bag and Thermarest pad worked well together. I was able to put my airpad inside the bottom sleeve of the Big Agnes preventing my sleeping bag from sliding off the pad. I also used a cocoon silk liner and don't think I was ever cold the nights we we out. (I would like to get a thin foam pad or piece of Tyvek to keep the sleeping bag off of the tent floor) The GoLite Imogene tent was easy to set up and spacious. I did have a small problem with water inside the tent. Not sure if it was a flaw or the way I could have set it up. With the amount of rain we had not sure if any tent would have been dry. I'm still looking into it. Please let me know if you have any thoughts on it. I really like my Osprey Aura 65L. I know it is heavier than some other packs, but as the week went on, I found it was more and more functional for me. Prior to leaving, I added some elastic cord to the front of the pack, allowing me to put my wet tent in a garbage bag and carrying it of the outside of the pack and keeping other items dry. I was able to dry out my tent once we arrived at the next campsite. Not sure what I would have done with the tent if it hadn't been sunny enough to dry it out. I guess I would have been sleeping in a wet tent. I also think I need some sort of towel or rag in case that happens. I used my pack cover to keep the pack and everything dry over night. I also purchased a ultralight ""fanny pack"" as the hip pockets are too small for the number of items I want to be able to reach on a long hike (I.e., snacks, phone, stick pic, trail guide, battery charger for my phone, etc.). The only problem with this set up was that my pack kept pressing on the buckle of the fanny pack on my back. I think I will try to add some loops to the back of the fanny pack so I would be able to just feed the backpack hip belt through it and eliminate the belt and buckle of the fanny pack.My small ultralight stove worked well but I did notice my friend's JetBoil was done in half the time. I haven't decided if that is worth the weight. Like I said, my stove worked fine. The coozy nesting bowls I made worked perfectly. One bowl is smaller than the other but big enough to hold a meal in a ziploc. Once I pour water into the meal, I am able to place the larger one over the smaller one to let it cook. My titanium cup was a little small for heating enough water for my meal and a cup of cocoa. I had to heat water separately if I water a cup of cocoa so I will look into a larger one.Handiwipes, dried then rehydrated, worked great! Just a small a amount of water and they are just as good as if they came out of the container.I wear contacts. My plan was to take a large ziploc, add some water and handsoap and wash my hands inside the ziploc. It worked well enough. I kept dropping my lenses and losing them. By the end of the trip I was down to the pair I was wearing and one spare lens. As it was the last day on the trail, I decided to wear my glasses out since I have never really hiked in them. Definitely need a croakie because sweat kept making them slide down to the tip of my nose. I also took with me two Sony chargers to power my various electronics (each weighs probably 12 ounces) I wasn't sure how long they would last and how much battery my phone would use. I was also using them to power my Fitbit and headlamp. I was very happy with how long my phone battery lasted on airplane mode. I also used my phone as my camera (trailname: Shutterbug LOL) so I'm guessing I was afraid of running out of juice. Lol I never needed the second charger but I only needed to recharge my Fitbit once and my phone back to 100% a couple of times. Looks I just lightened my pack by 12 ozs!Please let me know if you have any other questions or comments. Thanks!","Gooch Gap

Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/487866,"I want to send a great big THANK YOU to Sweet and Sour for the coffee advice. I was having a problem coming up with a good solution to my ""coffee on the trail"" dilemma. They recommended Land O Lakes cappuccino and Starbucks Via coffee packs. Loved it! Although I did choose the mint cocoa with Via, the combination was tasty - the perfect combination for me! I also greatly appreciate the advice they gave me regarding what to do with my tent when it rains and it's wet. I think their idea of putting the tent and footprint into ziplocs is a great idea and I'm sure I'll be using it in the future. On the trail I only had one large trash bag so I had to put everything in it. This meant that my tent, even though it was a little wet, ended up getting more wet from the fly and footprint because they were the same bag. I have also added a small chamois to my pack to wipe the tent down to help remove some of the water. Thanks again Sweet and Sour! If you have any other ideas, I'm all ears!","

Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/495104,"I had an opportunity to attend Trail Days in Damascus, VA this weekend. I am looking for a new tent since mine was stolen out of my backyard last week.   I thought it would be a great way to check out the many tents that are out there and to see them actually set up. I even got to talk to a few people who owned some of the tents I was interested in. There were also vendors who had their latest and greatest products. Honestly, I think I'm on information overload. I don't think I've seen the same tent twice. They all seemed to have features I liked and some features I didn't; they were to heavy, not big enough, the doors open the wrong way...you get the idea. I was able to eliminate a few just by looking at them. I really liked the tents Nemo had. But enough about tents...Trail Days is a celebration of hikers, those who were currently hiking the trail and those who had hiked it in years past. Over the weekend, I witnessed several reunions between hikers who hadn't seen each other in days and those who hadn't seen each other in years. The greetings weren't just ""oh, hey, how ya doing?"" They were 'hikers spotting each other from several feet away, high fivin', huggin, ""OMG, dude, how are you doing?, how's the knee, did you ever get that job?, my girlfriend and I got married, I'm hiking the PCT next year, you should come with me' kind of greeting. Something I could only guess comes from hiking many days together and passing the time in conversation. I hope to someday return to Trail Days and walk in the parade as a thru hiker. It has been fun. Tomorrow we are planning to hike from Massie Gap to Mt Rogers. I've done this section before but the ladies I'm with have not.   It should be a great hike. I hope to see ponies again. For now, I'll be falling asleep to the music of a band playing off in the distance.","

Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/495786,"Well...its on its way...my new tent. I HAD a GoLite Imogene 2 tent that I just loved. But apparently, someone near my house loved it more. I had just gotten home from an overnight camping trip. I had pitched my tent in my backyard to let it dry out and headed upstairs to shower. No more than 20 minutes later I went outside to bring it in. There was a big, empty space where my tent used to be. I live in a pretty nice neighborhood where this stuff normally doesn't happen. I'm still angry about it.... Well, back to my new tent. I finally decided on a Big Agnes Fly Creek UL2. I looked at a lot of tents and this one seemed to give me everything I was looking for. Weight, features and price were all factors.   REI's 20% off helped too. I'll let you know how it's working out soon.I just got back from spending the weekend in Damascus for Trail Days. It was a great place to go if you are thinking about buying a tent. Pretty much every tent was there - either being shown by a vendor or being used by a hiker. I talked to several people about their tents; what they liked and what they didn't. I have to say I don't think I heard one bad thing about the Fly Creek. I also came to really like the Nemo and Tarptents. I may try to get my hands on either of those down the road. We ended up tenting at the Woodchuck Hostel. I highly recommend this hostel. This is my second time staying there. Even though we were tenting, we had full use of the hostel, kitchen, showers, etc. and I found myself looking forward to the coffee, blueberry waffles and fresh bananas. Yum!On Sunday, we hiked from Massie Gap at Grayson Highlands State Park to the top of Mt Rogers.   It was an awesome hike. The views were spectacular and, of course, there were ponies. In fact, one hiker told us that a ranger had said there were 11 new ponies among the herds in just the last week. As we were nearing the Thomas Knob shelter, the sky was threatening to let loose. We had come so far to turn back so we pushed on. We made it to the top, had some snacks, took some pictures and headed back down again. It rained on us for about 5 minutes - just enough to make us get our rain gear out. Well, it was good practice anyway. Definitely made me appreciate buying a rain skirt. Easy to put on and take off. We were afraid the rocks would be wet from from the rain and be slick as we came down the mountain. But they seemed pretty dry and we made it back to the car. I had just sat down in my seat when I saw raindrops hitting my windshield. Ten seconds later...yep, you guessed it - RAIN! We were so happy it held off until we got in the car.Back at camp, the two ladies I was with both had recently bought jetboils. So we spent the evening cooking mountain houses, sipping wine, and retelling the days' adventure. It really was a fun weekend.","Damascus, VA

Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502087,"I had signed on to be a part of a group of ladies who were interested in doing a thru-hike and who wanted to do a long section hike to get a better idea of what a thru-hike would be all about. The idea was to also to slow down, enjoy with the forest, and take in the sights and sounds surrounding us. Carla ""Zipper"" Robertson, who thru-hiked in 2009, had introduced the idea on her website, Wild and White Blazing, at Livingwildandprecious.com. The website is ""a telecourse for women planning a thru-hike."" It's a place where a woman can go to talk to other women who have successfully completed a thru hike. You can talk gear, food drops, shelters, etc. or just get knowledge from them about their thru-hike. If you are a woman thinking about doing a thru-hike, please check this website out. It is awesome! I learned so much before I even left on the trail.Certificate and I arrived at the hotel. For a backpacking trip, my SUV seemed to be packed with so much stuff. It's the night before the hike, and I'm still trying to cram stuff into my pack. We were meeting another lady who was going on the hike, Jules Burroughs. She is a board member of and a hike leader for the Georgia Trail Dames. Ladies, you should also check out Trail Dames (another awesome group). After dinner we decide we would do shakedowns of each others' packs. Since mine was the largest and heaviest, I went first. I had never been on a seven day hike before, sooooo....I might have been carrying the kitchen sink... Jules and Certificate's insight and advice was invaluable. I ended up leaving some wool clothing that was redundant, half of my Nutella, half of my tortillas, a bag of extra drinks and snacks (which included some cocoa and coffee and snack size baggies of almonds, macadamia nuts, beef jerky and dried pineapple - this had to weigh a pound alone!), my waterproof case for my iPad that weighed close to a pound, my bushcraft knife, my pocket rocket and fuel (Certificate and I were sharing my Jetboil but we were suppose to spend an night on our own so I had brought extra stove and fuel. We just decided to eat together then separate), my camp shoes, and a few other things. I was able to shave off at least 5-6 lbs! Although, my camp shoes did manage to sneak onto my pack, it had to have been one of the lightest things I was going to leaving behind.The hotel had a scale in their weight room and I saw the chance to weigh my pack. I would be starting the trail with a 38 lb pack!","Mt Rogers

Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502089,"We drove up to Three Springs Hostel. It is where we would leave the car, catch a shuttle and eventually, spend a night at the end of the hike. Oma and Marsha were awesome and accommodating. The hostel is a beautiful house built in 1889, with a pond. They are located about a mile down the road from Hog Camp Gap. Marsha then drove us to Reeds Gap, our starting point of the hike. We met Zipper and she had some friends that were coming along for the day. Soon we were headed southbound on the trail. It was a beautiful hike through rhododendrons that had reached their peak probably a week earlier. Some flowers were still perfect on the plant but some had already fallen to the ground.   The pinks everywhere gave us a beautiful welcome to the trail.A little while down the trail, we decided to take a quick break to see how everyone was doing. After a couple of minutes, three thru-hikers were coming by. We stopped them to say hello and to see if they needed anything. They were Jester, Prefontaine and Harry Potter. It turns out that back on April 1st, Certificate and I were doing a section hike starting at Springer Mountain. We had stayed overnight at the Hiker Hostel and left the following morning on the van with 12 thru-hikers who were starting their hikes. Jester, Prefontaine, and Harry Potter were on that van. Harry Potter eventually got his trail name because he ended up sleeping under the stairs of the shelter one night. What are the odds of running into them again?! We had started late in the afternoon because it was just a short hike to the first shelter. We arrived at Maupin Creek Shelter, set up camp and spent the evening getting to know each other. Some of the questions posed to us were: what are you most proud of, what is something funny about you, and what is something you have struggled with and worked thru. They may seem like simple questions but try answering them yourself. It's hard. It's even harder when you have to talk about them among people you don't know well. Don't get me wrong, it turned out to be really fun. It was a great icebreaker and really helped us learn more about each other and where we all were coming from.   Zipper gave us these cool small journals to write down our thoughts along the trail. Since I was journaling on the iPad, I decided I would use mine to write down inspirational quotes that I could take on the trail and pull out when I needed a boost.Zipper also asked we bring a small dessert to share with everyone. I brought Rice Krispie Smores. I could have sworn they were lightweight but when I took them out of my pack they weighed a ton! Everyone was nice enough to let me share my dessert first to lighten my load. There was so much that I took half and gave it to the thru-hikers down at the shelter. The look on their faces was priceless. I will always remember how their eyes lit up. Love trail magic!We took turns hanging our food on bear poles. Pretty entertaining, honestly.

We were going to Harpers Creek Shelter which meant we would be going up and over Three Ridges. We ate lunch on Hanging Rock Overlook, which had an amazing view. Coming down from Three Ridges, we had stopped just before Chimney Rock for a break. We met several thru-hikers coming through. We met Wistful and Relentless, who I have been following through their trail journals. I hope to be able to send them out some trail magic along their journey. Obviously, I am writing this after my hike has ended. I had journaled throughout the hike but am just now cleaning them up and posting them. For some reason, I didn't write anything down as far as a journal for this day. My journal entry for that day read ""Three Ridges"" but that's it. Lol must have been one of those kind of days. I can remember the last two miles seemed to take forever. Jules and I were getting frustrated because those two miles seemed like five. The shelter must be just around the corner....nope....keep hiking. I must have been tired because I could remember thinking it was good thing the next day was a zero day. We camped in a large flat area, across the creek from the shelter. Down along the creek a ways, there was a group that was waiting to start the celebration.   Apparently, a couple of ladies in their group were finishing up their flip-flop thru-hike and ending after the Priest. They had balloons and streamers stretched from tree to tree before their camp as if it was a finish line. Congrats to the ladies for finishing! Although, I believe the celebration started looooong before you made it down off the mountain...Another memorable moment was meeting Regina, the ATC Ridge Runner for that section of the trail in VA. She is a thru-hiker of the AT and the PCT. She, and her friend John, were in the area doing some trail maintenance. She was sharing her knowledge with us and it was really great to hear her stories. It was frustrating though, because she and John had to pack out a whole trash bag of trash left behind by hikers. Pack out your own trash, hikers! Enough said...","Maupin Creek Shelter

Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502098,"Zero day. Some time, when you're in the forest, just close your eyes and listen to the many sounds around you.As I sit here along Harpers Creek, I can look out along the creek and watch the water flow downstream. There seems to be a busy, yet peaceful purpose to it. I can also see everyone in our group enjoying the forest in their own way. Certificate is at the shelter, journaling, and utilizing the picnic table; Jules is a little further down the stream, on a rock, journaling; and Linda just came by taking pictures of the beautiful campsite. I am perched on a rock along the stream, near a small waterfall. I am enjoying just sitting and listen to the water. There seems to be an connection between my inner peace and the sounds and flow of the water. Carla had mentioned a way to connect to God was to focus on one spot and slowly widen your view and to just experience my surroundings. I was looking up and immediately felt the presence of my father. I know he loves that I'm out here. I feel he's with me when I'm out in the forest. Maybe it's that the forest helps release all the negative feelings that a daily grind can build up so that spiritual things can find their way in. I know he's here with me. I just wish I could tell him how much I miss him and how much of who I am and what I do is because of him.I love to just sit by a creek and watch the water flow over and around the rocks. I sometimes imagine myself as a leaf floating along the water. I would go that way, then past that rock, then the water would spin me around at that juncture and I would be heading downstream backwards. Eventually the current would turn me around and I would be facing downstream again. Sometimes I would get stuck on a rock, but if I wait patiently, the flow would grab me and move me along again. Hmmm..kind of like life.The beauty that is surrounding me right now is inspirational. The sunlight coming through. The bright green leaves against the dark brown tree trunks is breathtaking. It is such a contrast. The tree trucks are rugged, weathered and cracked. The leaves are bright, light and dancing in the slight breeze. Somehow together they existed because of one another, despite their differences.","Harpers Creek Shelter

The next curve - yep, you guessed it! It did get pretty discouraging after awhile. It was a tough 7.4 miles, but it was so worth it. The view was spectacular! The air was clear and the valley and mountains were green. Stunning.An amazing thing happened to me today. I had been listening to music while I was hiking but it just didn't seem to match my mood. I had been thinking of my dad all day and was in a solemn state of mind. My father died when I was 19. We didn't get a chance to say goodbye. He was there one day and gone the next. I often feel he is with me and watching over me. I have wondered several times what he would have thought of me hiking the trail. I had just changed my music to the soundtrack from the movie The Way. As I hit ""play"" I remember seeing the title to the first song - A Higher Place. As the music started and I took a couple of steps. I stepped up onto a rock and a ray of sunshine warmed my face. We had been hiking under tree cover all day, somehow a ray of sun found my face. I can't explain it but it was as if Daddy was telling me he was ok, he was at peace, he was happy about what I was doing and that I was exactly where he wanted me to be.

I just broke down and cried. She asked if I was ok, I said yes and shared with her what had happened. It was an amazing moment and I've never felt a more inner peace.We are camping near the Priest Shelter tonight. My tent is set up between two boulders.

We were headed to Spy Rock and then to Seeley-Woodworth Shelter. Before we got too far down the trail, Zipper had prepared a certificate she wanted to present to Certificate for completing the Priest. It was very cool! (Zipper made one for all of us!) It was a nice day but it seemed long. Spy Rock was awesome because Regina Reiter and her friend, John, met us up at the top unexpectedly. Regina is the Ridge Runner for this area and they were there to clear out some illegal fire rings that had been built by hikers. They also provided us with some trail magic! Fresh strawberries, apples and caramels! OMG, they were so good! It was fun to see them again and to hear more of Regina's hiking stories. It was tough to say goodbye but, eventually, we needed to keep hiking. Throughout the day, we would pass hikers. We would say hello as they passed by and kept hiking. One hiker said hello as he passed me, and something in my brain said he sounded familiar. I quickly turned around to ask him his trail name. He said, in a Boston accent, ""Haaaadwaare."" No way! Certificate and I were doing a section hike starting at Springer Mountain back in April and we met him on day 2 of his thru hike. I was so happy to see he was still on the trail. He was hiking in honor of his friend who had died of lung cancer and raising money for cancer research.   There is a facebook page, Cathy's Climb, that he posts to allowing folks to follow his journey. There is also a gofundme page if you would like to donate. Good guy and great cause. He looked a lot skinnier since we saw him - he told us he had lost 50 lbs so far on his hike. I had taken a picture of him when we were receiving trail magic in Horse Gap (might be Cooper Gap). He is an retired professional boxer. Check out the before and after pictures.

Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/505327,"What a beautiful day for a hike. The trail had some rocky spots but great views. We were hiking along and commenting how nice it was that someone had come out to the trail and mowed the vegetation back about four feet on both sides of the trail. We knew if it hadn't been mowed, we would have been hiking in a narrow corridor of tall plants and probably stepping right along some snakes. We found a nice, shady spot along the mowed grass and just before a big climb. We talked to a couple of thru hikers as they were passing by. After our break, we headed up. I was up in front, watching where I was putting my feet. I can remember pointing out things to myself ""rock, stick, avoid that, don't step there, watch that rock, another stick...wait, NOT a stick! I stopped so abruptly that Certificate nearly bumped into me. It was a beautiful, small grey snake laying across the path. (I, admittingly, am not familiar with most snakes. I just make the rule to leave them alone. Simple, easy to follow). Da Bomb was able to get a couple of pictures of it before it bolted for safety. Zipper indicated it was a ring neck snake. It was pretty, but I was glad that's all it was. As we continued up, we came across two gentlemen who were finishing up clearing the area with weed wackers. Our heroes!! They were from the Natural Bridge Appalachian Trail Club. We couldn't thank them enough. They had cleared a long section all the way to the top of the mountain. Huge shout out to them! Thank you!We hiked along Tar Jacket Ridge. I think it was one of my favorite moments of the hike. The sun was shining, we were on top of the mountain and the view was beautiful. But the best part - wild strawberries! They were small - no bigger than a small marble - but they had more flavor than any you'll find in a store. We took our time, hiking and eating strawberries, then hiking some more. Just a fun day over all.We made to Hog Stamp Gap. The water source was quite a ways away from the camp sites near the trail, but Zipper remembered a great camping spot on the way to the water. It was a nice covered area, blanketed with pine needles. Quiet and secluded, it was perfect. Certificate, Da Bomb and I had decided that because Hog Stamp Gap was about a mile from the hostel where my car was parked, that we would camp there for the night and hike out the next morning to the hostel for a shower and a bed. Zipper was going to continue hiking as she had some friends that were going to meet her at a road crossing the next morning and provide trail magic to thru hikers. We would meet up with Zipper the next morning while she handing out trail magic.Three Springs Hostel is a relatively new hostel, but it has quickly become my favorite. The house is historic, built in1889, but renovated with modern amenities. They are located close to the trail but they offer shuttle service to and from the trail. They have a small refrigerator loaded with drinks and chips and candy for sale. (TWO thumbs up! An ice cold sweet tea after hiking was awesome!). You just write down what you take on a card and then pay for it when you pay for your stay. They allowed me to park my car for 6 days. There's a pond where you can kayak and a patio to sit out on. Oma and Marsha were so nice. But my favorite part was that they offer dinner AND breakfast. Clean and friendly - I can't recommend this place enough!The next morning we met Zipper at her trail magic. It was fun to watch thru hikers get excited about donuts and mimosas (seriously, who wouldn't be?!?). We could tell that, even the little things like a small piece of banana or somewhere to unload their trash was just enough to make their day. It was very fun and has inspired me to perform some trail magic for thru hikers next season.   All in all, this past week has to be one of the hardest and most rewarding adventures I have been on. The scenery was amazing. The trail was challenging. But it was the people I hiked with and encountered that made the hike so memorable. I know I am changed person from just six days on the trail. I am excited to think what 6 months could do for me.","Seeley-Woodworth Shelter

Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/506763,"I was so happy when I got a text from my friend, Alex, aka Caboose, (or ""Boooose"" as I affectionately call her), asking how far Franklin, NC is from me. Boose and I became good friends as we hiked around the Raleigh/Greensboro, NC area. As I now live a few hours away in SC, we don't get to hike together as often. She told me that she would be near Franklin because she was performing trail magic for a hiker who was stranded and trying to get home to Franklin. I was only a couple hours away and had the weekend off. Let's go hiking on the AT!   We met up at the NOC. I left after work and didn't arrive until 5:00 pm or so. We decided it was too late to head out on the trail so we ate dinner at the restaurant. There was still the matter of where we were going to camp for the night. Luckily, Boose had a friend that had some property not too far away and who was nice enough to let us camp there for the night. Not wanting to drag everything out, we decided we would just car camp. I have a Xterra and Boose has an Escape. She'll probably deny it, but I still think I was probably more comfortable than she was. I'm short and fit in my car pretty well. She's taller and was sharing her car with the greatest hiking dog ever (in my opinion), Gia. I woke feeling a few kinks from the car camping. We took our time getting up (well, I did anyway...), made some breakfast, re-packed our packs and headed out. The section we chose was Wayah Bald to Winding Stair Gap. Since we had two cars, it made sense to leave one at the end and drive the other to the start. Of course, there is no direct route from Point A to Point B...nooooo, that would too easy! Lol. I don't remember the actual distance, I just remember it was a loooong drive. It had to have been 1 o'clock or so when we actually hit the trail. Luckily, we were doing a short stretch, just to the Siler Bald shelter. I would say half way into our hike it started raining.   Did I mention it was raining? cuz I really meant POURING! Gia kept turning around and looking at us as if to say, ""you WANT to be out in this?"" She was a trooper though. She just kept walking along like it was no big deal. I, on the other hand, was writing a list in my mind of things I learned while hiking in a thunderstorm/downpour. (1) Put rain gear where it is more easily accessible. It came on so fast I don't remember having time to get my rain gear out. And, by the time I even thought about gear, I was just too wet to bother. (2) Keep a buff handy. One thing I learned while hiking in the rain is that when my hair gets that wet it will just flop down over my eyes. I wear contact lenses. Water pouring down onto my face does a number on my contact lenses, thus my vision. Not good. I had a pack towel but it was so wet I was having to wring it out every few steps and it had become essentially useless. There's a note in my journal from that evening that simply said ""goggles!"" Lol (3) and probably the most important lesson of all, pay attention to the weather. I really seem to have a problem keeping up with this one. I think it turned out to be an 80% chance of rain that weekend....Boose and I were trying to make light of the weather by singing or coming up with songs that had rain in it. I can remember Here Comes the Rain Again by the Eurythmics, Rainy Days and Mondays by the Carpenters, It's Raining Men by the Weather Girls, Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head by BJ Thomas. Caboose could probably remember more than this. (Hey, it was better than singing commercial jingles that I originally proposed. Lol)Oh yeah, to top it off...I seem to be having a small issue with my right knee. I have no problem going uphill but going downhill, my knee refuses to bend. A little painful but more annoying than anything else. It doesn't happen all the time. I think it has to do with my hamstring tightening and the need to stretch more. Anyway, the blue blaze trail that took us to the shelter was .5 mile downhill -yes, .5 miles! Ugh! So for half a mile, I was doing my best impersonation of Dr. Frankenstein's assistant, Igor, dragging my right leg sort of behind me. I was even joking to myself and saying ""Master, he's alive! He's ALIVE."" Odd, I know, but I had to laugh at the situation and make fun of what I must have looked like. Thankfully, we were the only ones at the shelter. We made quick work of claiming spots just in case more people came in, changing into dry clothes, and hanging packs and wet clothes. Alex had Gia dried off and snuggled in her warm blanket when company arrived. It was a long section hiker, AT-AT Walker. She has a journal here and it's a fun read if you're looking for someone to follow. She looked pretty soaked. She was happy to finally make it to the shelter because the trail and trail signs had her going in circles. She had to consult the guide book she was following to realize the trail looped around. She was actually hiking northbound, did a couple loops and ended up getting to the shelter heading south. Not fun, I'm sure, in the pouring rain. She had contemplated setting up her tent but thought twice since it was still raining hard and she figured that Gia might keep the mice away. (Although I don't know if Gia would have left the warmth of her blanket for a mouse.). Best part of the night - Alex had brought a small container of Maker's Mark and we passed it around as we enjoyed listening to AT-AT Walker's experiences on her hike. The Maker's Mark took the chill off from the inside out. Warm and fed, I crawl into my sleeping bag. As I'm laying there, it occurred to me how loud the rain was on the tin roof. The rain would let up for a second, then shortly followed by a gust of wind that would knock water from the trees. That water, added to the rain already hitting the roof, would amplify the noise ten-fold. I thought to myself, it is going to be hard to sleep tonight. Ha!

Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/507333,"It was still raining when I awoke the next morning. I always seem to be the last one up. This time probably because it was not a good night's rest. I tossed and turned, and flipped and flopped most of the night. At some point I must have fallen asleep because AT Walker and Caboose were in agreement that I snore. That's why I usually like to sleep in my tent, but it was raining. I really hate to subject anyone to my snoring. ...so embarrassing... LolWe contemplated our game plan for the day over breakfast. It was still raining. We knew we had a short 4.5 mile hike to the car. We knew the terrain should be relatively easy. We knew the trail from the shelter was .5 straight up just to get back to the AT. We knew the trail would be muddy. And we also knew we had to leave sometime soon because Caboose still had a 5 hour drive ahead of her.   Rain or no rain, we were going to have to head out soon.The night before, I came to a realization that I was going to get experience a new sensation, albeit not a good one. It would the first time I got to put on cold, and still wet, hiking clothes. Um...let me just say...Ewwwww! (I know, I know...get used to it, right? Lol). I quickly threw on my rain jacket to hopefully keep in some body heat. It was still raining at 10 o'clock when we decided we needed to leave the shelter. We said our goodbyes to AT-AT Walker as we would soon be heading in opposite directions. Caboose, Gia, and I started up the .5 mile blue blaze trail back to the AT. The rain seem to let up and it wasn't long until I needed to take off the rain jacket. It was a really nice section of trail with rolling hills and short inclines and declines. We were probably less than a mile from the car when the rain came back! Too quick to allow us to get rain gear on. I remember passing a waterfall but we hesitated and kept hiking because the rain was so bad. We finally reached the car but not before everything was soaking wet again. I felt sorry climbing into Caboose's car because we were getting everything so wet. Despite the weather, I had an amazing time. It was good to hike with Caboose again. And, every time I hike the AT, it seems to show me something different. The weather, terrain, views, ascents and descents - nothing is ever the same. I love these short trips because I seem to learn something new every time. I get to tweak my gear just a little more. Fine tuning what works and eliminating what doesn't. Hopefully, when I do get to start my thru hike, I'll be ready....so I'd like to think...lol ...now, if I could just pay attention to the weather...","Siler Bald shelter

(Actually, it was a momma and two cubs.)Good news is...I saw a momma bear and her cubs today! Bad news is...I wasn't even on a trail. Certificate and I were on our way to Jones Gap State Park in SC to check out a trail were are doing next week for the South Carolina Trail Dames. We were on a long and winding road that had started to lull me to sleep, when we came around a curve and saw them. It took a second to focus on what those big dark creatures were in the middle of the road - BEARS! Momma and two cubs! Momma took one look at us and ran off into the bushes. I found it funny that she took off and left the babies behind, considering how protective they are of their young.   The cubs scampered up a driveway a short bit but turned around to take a look at us. I couldn't get my camera on my phone to work fast enough. Certificate rolled down my window so I could get a better shot. My immediate reaction was, ""what are you doing!? There's bears out there!""

Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/510679,"Here's a math question for you (don't worry, it's not hard...):""If a hiker hikes north for 1.5 miles, then south for 1.5 miles, south for 1.4 miles and then north for 1.4 miles, where would the hiker be? Yep, you're right! The exact SAME spot the hiker started. (Told ya it wasn't hard...)That is how Certificate and my hike went the other day. Back in April, Certificate and I had done a short stretch from Springer Mountain to Gooch Gap. I had a couple of days off coming up so we decided to put in a few miles from where we left off. Sally, our shuttle driver, dropped us off at Gooch Gap around 4:00 p.m. We head north, but it wasn't long after we started out it began to rain buckets! As we are hiking in the rain, we are discussing our plan and options. Certificate was using AWOL's guide from 2014 and I had a page from his 2015 guide. We had made the plan to hike up a couple of miles to the first campsite (Liss Gap) for the night. But...my guide didn't show camping at Liss Gap. The next campsite in my guide was several miles away. Too far, given how late in the day it was and the uncooperative weather. We were soaking wet already. We made it about a mile and a half before we decide to turn around and hike back to Gooch shelter, which was only 1.4 miles south of the gap, dry out, regroup, and do the extra mile and a half the next day. As we hike are hiking to the shelter, I keep mentioning to Certificate that since we turned around the rain had let up. Lol, figures, right? When we arrived at the shelter it had practically stopped. Feeling as though we were the only ones on the trail, we were surprised to find several people already in the shelter, including two dogs. There was a young couple that had attempted to put their tent up in the shelter but was having a tough time of it because it wasn't a freestanding tent. They decided to leave the shelter, put their tent up on a campsite, and indicated we could have that space if we wanted it. The rain had stopped and the sun seemed to be trying to peek through so we decided to set up our tent and hammock. It occurred to me as I was driving in one of my stakes that we hiked all the way back to the shelter and then didn't even use it. Lol I was having trouble getting my last stake in (gravel) when the skies opened up again. I dove into my tent and set up my pad and sleeping pad while listening to the deluge outside. It finally let up, I emerged from my tent. I took refuge under Certificate's tarp and we ate dinner while it started to rain again. After dinner, the rain showed no signs of letting up, so I made a run for my tent.When I entered my tent, I could already see the floor of my tent was wet. I am still not sure what was causing the water to come in. It wasn't a lot but enough to make everything in touch with the floor wet. I had my air pad inflated so it was creating a small island in my tent ocean. I placed my pack cover on my pack and flipped it over making it like a little canoe. Everything I didn't want wet went in the trash bag inside my pack, everything already wet (clothes, etc) sat on top. Once I was satisfied all was safe, I fell asleep. I slept pretty well despite sleeping on a small island. I did wake up several times, either because a part of me slid off my little island and had gotten wet, or to simply reaffirm ""yep, it's still raining..."" Morning came, and yep, you guessed it, it was still raining. Certificate and I packed up and made our way to the shelter. I passed the tent the young couple were attempting to put up the night before and it didn't look good. There were many areas where pools of rain had accumulated so I was really hoping they weren't still in it. It could not have been a good night for them... We were greeted at the shelter by the young couple! They had lasted about a half hour in the rain. They grabbed their sleep pads and blankets, and spent the night in the shelter. I'm glad we didn't take the space in the shelter. Turned out they needed it more than we did. The weather report was not good. ""Expected rain showers continuing thoughout the day."" The two guys with the dogs had already decided to take a zero at the shelter. The young couple had concluded that they needed another tent. I agreed. Also, my tent, and most everything in it, was soaking wet. I needed to come up with a better plan for my sleeping arrangements too. I mentioned to the young couple that if they wanted, we could try to get a shuttle to Mountain Crossings at Neels Gap where my car was parked. They could look for a new tent there. If they found one, I was more than happy to run them back to the trail. So we formulated a plan, and with the help from Verizon, contacted Sally to see if she could give us a ride back our cars. Hooray for shuttle drivers who will drop everything to rescue soaking wet, muddy, stinky hikers! Thank you Sally! The young couple did find a tent but had decided to camp behind Mountain Crossings to try out their new tent. If it didn't work out, at least they didn't have far to go to the outfitter. As I was driving home, it occurred to me that when I am on my thru hike, there are going to be days, probably many days, where I'm not going to be able to just call up a shuttle to take me to a warm and dry place. I'm going to have to suck it up and deal with it.   My entire tent was so wet, I just put it in a trash bag and strapped it to the outside of my pack. No biggie. I can dry it out when I get home. But what if I'm on the trail? What can I do? Do I carry a chamois to wipe out the inside? I would love to hear suggestions on how to hikers have dealt with wet tents while on the trail.   I chalk this trip as a learning experience, even though I only did a mile and a half towards my goal.","Gooch Gap

Since we were all coming from different directions, it seemed like an easy place to meet. I was coming from SC; Jules was coming from GA and Cuppa Tea was up north but heading back to FL. I had met Jules on a 7-day hike I did back in June with Zipper, a 2009 thru hiker, and owner of Wild and White Blazing. Cuppa Tea had contacted me through Trail Journals asking if I would be interested in hiking a few days with her. She is starting her thru hike next spring and wanted to get a few miles under her belt. I was able to arrange a few days off and, after about a million texts and emails, plans of this, changing to that (mostly because of me), we finally formulate a plan and away we go!Driving into Franklin, I immediately fell in love with the town. The downtown area was cute and it reminded me of the small town I grew up in. AND, there's a little bakery place right across from outfitter. What's not to love!?! I went into Outdoor 76 to find Jules and Cuppa Tea finishing up shake downs of their packs. I think Cuppa was able to shave a little weight. After grabbing a bite to eat, we are on our way.The plan was to leave a car at Rock Gap, drive to Deep Gap, and then hike back to Rock Gap. Since we had started out so late in the afternoon, we hiked a short way in to Standing Indian shelter. It is small shelter with not a lot of flat tenting space. There was plenty of cleared area but all at a slope. The area immediately around the shelter is limited but we made it work. Jules was able to find a couple of trees for her hammock, Cuppa found a small flat area and I took the small area next to the shelter. It was fun to sit, have dinner and just enjoy some great company. Then...the sun went down.... I had retired to my tent to do some journaling before going to sleep, when all of sudden I hear ""scritch, scritch, scritch"" - the sound of something small climbing up my tent. I lay my tablet aside just in time to see a silhouette of a large mouse run across the top of my tent, between the tent and the fly. Awesome!....NOT! They enjoyed climbing my tent all night as if it was a brand new jungle gym.   They kept me up all night with their antics but were nice enough not to chew holes in anything.

It seems I was the only one that had real mice problems the night before. Cuppa Tea had a couple but they eventually left her alone. Jules didn't have mice but she had a spider that decided to make its home on her tarp. After a leisurely breakfast and pack up, we hit the trail.   There were no real views to speak of and the trail just went up and down. There were a lot of rhododendron tunnels but no views.We make it to Carter Gap shelter. Plenty of tenting space away from the shelter. Yeah! We get busy setting up camp. Jules and Cuppa head off to get water. They return after just a couple of minutes - the water didn't look all that great. No deep pools or moving water. The water they brought back was brown and had a lot of ""particulates"" in it. I think the water they gave me was the best looking out of the lot. At least we had enough water for dinner and until the next source that was just up the trail.   Tonight, I would dine on my favorite trail meal - beef ramen with lemon pepper tuna. It was a short 7+ mile day so it was still pretty light when we finished dinner. I had dropped a small piece of noodle on the ground.   (I do not condone feeding wildlife. I believe nothing good comes of it.). As we were starting to clean up from dinner, a tiny mouse came out to check us out. I was really surprised to see a mouse out in daylight. But I guess the ""early mouse"" get the ramen noodle... At first, it was so small and so cute. Awww, it found a noodle I dropped, how cute...but then it had a taste of food and the game was on! (Exactly why you don't feed the wildlife) The mouse was here, over there, under the log, heading toward my food bag, darting back under the log, back towards the bag, under the log Jules and Cuppa were sitting on, then towards their food bags. This little guy was relentless! We were afraid to turn our backs on him because he would head right for us. We were finally able to grab all our gear and run off to our tents.You would think, that while you are in a forest, there would be a million places to hang your food bag. Carter Gap shelter - not so much...we spent at least a half an hour (maybe longer) looking for somewhere to hang our food. Jules finally found ONE branch so we all hung our bags together. I only had one or two mice encounters during the night. Yeah! (I think most of them were living in the privy based on the number of nests in it.) But something else strange happened that night that I can't explain. I was still awake when I heard Jules and Cuppa Tea having to get the food bags down in the dark off in the distance. I know it was both of them because I could hear enough of their voices it know they were helping each other. Sooooo....if they are both at the food bags....who is walking around outside my tent? I could hear footsteps. Maybe I'm going crazy, but I know what I heard. Footsteps. But Jules and Cuppa were off my n the distance. Soon, I hear their voices getting closer so I know they are on their way back. I eventually fall asleep. In the morning, Jules mentioned something about hills being a battleground or haunted or something. I relay my encounter with footsteps and how freaky it was knowing it wasn't either of them outside my tent. Appalachian Ghost? Deer? Who knows....","Standing Indian shelter

It was more like a lodge - warm, comfy and cozy. The three of us had the upstairs to ourselves. Maggie and Steve were awesome! Maggie brought us tea prior to dinner. At 5:00, dinner included chicken with rosemary and gravy (yum!), a broccoli and cauliflower medley, and sweet potatoes. Dessert was apple pie with whipped cream. Yum yum!

So much has happened lately I can't seem to keep up. I guess that's a good problem to have. The first event was a 7.5 mile hike with my friend, Certificate. I really have come to love this hike. Long, but just hard enough to feel like a training hike. Scenic, but not so much that you stop every 10 minutes to take a picture. Half way through we took a break and had a snack. 20 minutes later we were up and hiking again. I would really like to do this hike more often but it is a little too far to go on a weekly basis.Next, we did (or tried to do) a Trail Dames hike at Caesars Head State Park. As I was driving up the mountain to the park, it started snowing. It was a light snow but it was sticking to the roads. We could have easily hiked in it, but I was afraid of what the roads would look like 3 or 4 hours later. As Certificate, Turbo, and I waited for the last Trail Dame to show up, we were just three big kids playing in the snow. Certificate made a snow angel, and we passed the time taking selfies to post on Facebook. We finally got a message from the last lady saying that she couldn't make it up the mountain and was turning around. After that, the consensus was to head down the hill and find a hike in lower elevation. But first, lunch! We ate a ""trendy"" cafe. Not normally my kind of place but it was close and I was hungry. I ordered carrot ginger soup and a grilled panini sandwich. (Yep, that kind place..) But...in all honesty...the food was awesome! I'll have to try places like this more often. After lunch, Certificate wanted to stop at a local outfitters, so the girls went shopping! I know what you're thinking but, don't worry, we actually got a hike in that day. We ended up hiking a 4 mile hike at Paris Mountain State Park in Greenville. It was a fun day with some great ladies AND we got a hike in!Next, I got to meet and go on a hike with Sarah Ellison-Dingus. She is as enthusiastic about hiking as I am and a fellow gear junkie. I've seen her on the Facebook threads about hiking, and in a thru hikers's video as she helped get off the mountain as a storm was coming in. I have even seen a couple of her hiking videos on YouTube. I was so happy to meet her and her hiking dog, Angus. Along the trail, we came to a section on the trail that seem to disappear into the river. She motioned that I would need to skirt around rocks along a small ledge, no more than two feet wide. It finally occurred to me that this was the section I had seen in pictures and videos and had made a mental note that I looked forward to do this section of trail. I was giddy to the point of nerdiness! It was a beautiful hike and the Laurel Creek waterfall did not disappoint. It was also a chance for me to play around with my GoPro camera. Sarah and Angus were so nice and I appreciate them sharing that awesome hike with me. Feel free to check out my YouTube video. My channel is Shutterbug ontheAT.","Licklog Gap

In order to aid them, I have borrowed this list of trail lingo. Some terms I may use in my journaling are:NOBO -- northbounder, a person hiking from south to northSOBO -- southbounder, a person hiking north to southGA-ME or GAME -- Georgia to MaineMEGA -- Maine to GeorgiaPUD -- pointless ups and downsPrivy -- basically a 3 sided outhouse (some have great views I hear!)Slackpacking -- generally you leave all of your gear (except a day pack) at a hostel or other secure place and someone shuttles you ""x"" amount of miles up the trail and you hike back to the beginning point. This allows you to get in high miles, carry little weight, and spend another night in town.Shelter -- usually a 3-sided wooden structure that can serve as your home. You just throw your sleeping pad and bag in there and call it home for the night.LNT -- Leave No Trace, this is the ethical philosophy hikers are expected to adopt, in that you leave no trace behind so the people following you do not know that you were ever there, it is a person's personal responsibility and part they take in keeping natural areas preserved for all to enjoyHYOH -- Hike Your Own Hike, another mantra that is repeated throughout the community. It basically means don't ever do something you don't want or don't feel comfortable doing just because others are. It is your hike, and you should hike it your own way.Blue Blazing -- There are several other trails and sights to see off the AT. Blue blazes mark these places and it is the individual's choice to go see it or not. Yellow Blazing -- Walking along roads (yellow lines) instead of on the trailTrail Magic -- when something is offered or happens unexpectedly and at the exact moment that you really needed it Trail Angel -- people who help out hikers, be it offering a ride, a place to stay, food, etc. Stealth Camping -- this has many different definitions to people, but to me it means that you are camped in an area that is not a designated campground. If it's a place where it is technically illegal to camp, then you make every effort to go un-noticed for the night. Regardless of legality, LNT policies are especially important here (but actually always).

Wild Thang and I were coming along to hike a few days with her and to see her off right. The Hiker Hostel is my favorite hostel, by far. I am sorry to hear they have put it up for sale. When we arrived, we were told we would be in one of the bunk rooms upstairs and that we would be sharing the room with two young men. When we walked into the room, I just laughed. It looked we had walked into a college students' dorm room. There were clothes and gear everywhere! There were two sets of bunks, a dresser, a desk and a chair in the room. Everything had something hanging off of it. Cuppa Tea gently nudged one of the guys off of one of the bottom bunks and he agreed to take one of the top bunks. I took the other top bunk. We were up at 7:00 am for coffee at the Hiker Hostel in Dahlonega, GA and to mingle with the other hikers. Breakfast was served at 7:30. A young couple, Rhythm and Dr. C, sat next to us at breakfast and we struck up a conversation.   They were a 30-something from Oklahoma, traveling in a group of 11, who had quit their jobs and were hiking the trail. After the trail, they were traveling to India and then to Peru. How cool!A friend of ours, Fran, trail angel extraordinaire, was going to drive us to Springer Mountain, so there was no real rush to leave. Wild Thang still had some packing to do and I had to make a quick run into town. We left the hostel at about 9:30 and still had an hour drive to the trail head.   When we arrived, we left our packs in Fran's car and made the .9 mile hike up to the top of Springer Mountain, the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail.   There didn't seem to be too many thru hikers on the top as it was later in the morning but there were plenty of section hikers. We all had our pictures taken with the plaques, and ensured we all had one of Cuppa Tea at her first white blaze. Confident we had all the pictures needed, we headed down to the car. When we arrived back at the car, it was about 1230. We all agreed we should grab lunch before we loaded on our packs and started up the trail. 45 mins later, we were heading out.   As we started to fall into line to start hiking the trail, one thought entered my mind - Cuppa Tea's journey was about to begin...The hike to our first campsite was perfect. It was sunny with a slight breeze, the temperature was in the mid-60s and the trail was relatively smooth and downhill. We arrived at camp at about 4:00 pm. Happy to be at the place we would be calling home for the evening, we quickly got to work setting up our respective shelters - Cuppa Tea and Wild Thang hanging their hammocks and I, setting up my tent. Dinners were eaten, a fire lit, bear bags hung and as we wait for the sun to set, Cuppa Tea is giving Wild Thang dance lessons on how to do the Rumba. It was an amazing day.

I grabbed a cup of coffee and a quick breakfast of a kind bar before starting the task of breaking down camp. We hit the trail about 9:45 am - 15 minutes later than we said we wanted to leave.   Sometimes it's just so hard getting moving in the morning.A little ways down the trail, we took the short side trail to the Long Creek Falls.   We spent a few minutes there, took pictures and hiked back to the trail. Our next stop was the Hickory Flats Cemetary. We wanted to just check it out but because there was a pavilion, restrooms and chairs to sit on, we decided it would be a great place to have lunch. On our way to the pavilion, we crossed paths with two trail ambassadors, one of which was Richard Judy, the author of the book 'Thru.' They were hiking that section of the trail and talking to the hikers. They wanted to encourage hikers to leave no trace, pack out their trash, but also generally to make sure everyone was doing okay.    The rest of the day was steady inclines and declines. Nothing too exciting to report.We arrived at Horse Gap, where we were meeting our friend and trail angel extraordinaire, Fran. She was going to bring us dinner, some water as there is no water source at this gap, and then camp with us for the night. She would head home the next morning. We arrived at Horse Gap before Fran, so we started to look around for possible campsites. Nothing looked great for two tents and two hammocks. When we had determined that nothing really looked good, Fran drove up. We indicated to Fran that no areas looked good for camping, she said that magic word - Cabin? Uh...yes, please!When we arrived, Fran noticed air escaping from her car's tire.   She had run over something that had punctured her tire and it was quickly going flat. She had to walk up the road a ways to get cell service to call her husband. As she headed back towards the cabin, she was finally was able to get a hold of her husband. He was awesome! He came out and fixed it for us.   Otherwise, it could have been interesting getting back to the trail head the next morning. I did have a thought while all of this was going on - Fran had spent all day performing trail magic for thru hikers but, at the end of the day, she was going to need a little trail magic herself. Hubby to the rescue!Even though she had had a full day of trail magic, Fran cooked us some amazing chicken fajitas, Mexican rice, and had brought avocados (yum!), Caesar salad and SWEET TEA! OMG, I was in heaven! I think ""hiker hunger"" must be kicking in. I ate two fajitas, two helpings of rice and salad. As we were cleaning up, she was going to throw away the rest of the rice - I ate that too. I was well fed, clean, dry, and warm.

Throughout day, hikers would pass us and ask if one of us was Cuppa Tea. They told us they were instructed by the ladies doing trail magic down in the gap to look for Cuppa Tea and make sure she was doing ok. It was fun because Cuppa Tea had become an instant trail celebrity.   It was funny because it seems like everyone was asking about her. Fran and Wild Thang must have made quite an impression! HahaSoon, we came to the crossing of Justus Creek. There were some folks from the Spring Valley Baptist Church providing trail magic in the form of fresh brewed coffee, snickers and M&M'S. The coffee was hot and the scenery was awesome. What a perfect place to set up trail magic! A nice young man, Vlad, offered to carry Cuppa Tea's pack across the creek. She took him up on that offer.   As we were leaving, he offered to carry her pack up the steep stairs. Once again, she took him up on it. We were up and over both Sassafras and Justus mountains in 2 hrs. We did the remaining 4+ miles in 3 hours arriving at the campsite around 4:00 pm. The weather report predicted it would rain by 4:30. For once, the weatherman was right on the money! No sooner did we start setting up our shelters that it began to rain.   Cuppa Tea had her tarp up in seconds so she came over and helped me get my fly up on my tent. (Possibly...one good reason to switch from a tent to a hammock). Then she went back and finished putting up her hammock while I went to look for a place to hang our foods bags. The rain made the search for a good branch a little tricky. It was hard to see very well between the rain and the hood of my jacket. We selected a branch that looked like it would hold our bags well enough...more on that later. As Cuppa Tea would soon be hiking alone, it was probably best she get a little practice throwing a bear line. It took her a few tries, because a few mis-throws and a couple because I was standing on the line...Haha, OOPS!   We finally got the line up and turned our attention to getting a snack and something to drink. It continued to rain, even through dinner. At least we were protected from the rain by the tarp.   (Possibly...another good reason to switch to a hammock.). It was awesome day of hiking. I am dry for now but it is expected to keep raining over night. As I type this, I hear a sound. I can't tell if that is an airplane or thunder off in the distance...should be a fun night...Post notes: As I lay in my tent, I sensed that the rain was letting up. Yeah! A few seconds later, an owl starting hooting. Hoot-hoot-hoot-hoo-oot...a few seconds of silence....Hoot-hoot-hoot-hoo-oot...a few seconds of silence (this went on for several minutes)...then...(I don't remember how much time had gone by)...CCRRAACK!! It sounded like a tree had fallen...I found out in the morning that the tree I heard fall in the night was actually the branch that we had hung our food bags on. It had broken in the middle of the night and our food bags had been laying on the ground. Lucky for us, no bear wanted to venture out in the rain for a few snacks...","Horse Gap

Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530153,"We left camp late this morning as it took us a while to get going. I don't think we left camp until 10:30 am. Several hikers that we had seen yesterday past nearby us as we were breaking camp. From the sounds of it it seems as though everybody had a rough night due to the weather.We had made it down the mountain and was entering into Woody Gap. As with any road crossing, there is always a moment of disorientation when you're trying to figure out where you are, where the trail is on the other side of the road, and if any are cars coming, etc. As I'm looking around to see where to go, a young boy asks from across the road, ""Would you like a pop?"" I was so delighted to hear this, I almost didn't pay attention to traffic. Haha, good thing no cars were coming at the time. As I made my way across the road, a nice man called me over and told me to help myself to a soda and some cookies. I had an ICE COLD Sprite and a couple of homemade oatmeal craisin cookies. Let me tell you, that really hit the spot! Thank you to Gabe and Shadow (thru-hikers of '04) and your grandchildren, for the amazing trail magic! CuppaTea and I found a bench to sit on where we could take off our shoes and socks and let our feet dry out. We enjoyed our lunch and trail magic sitting in the sun. The hike after Woody Gap had us going up, then down, then up again, but rewarding us with some amazing views. We made it to Lance Creek by 4:15 pm. Lance Creek is where everybody camps in order to set them up for reasonable amount of hiking the next day. The hike up and over Blood Mountain and into Neels Gap is 7.4 miles. Any closer to Blood Mountain, the hiker would need to carry a bear canister. Too much weight! I expected Lance Creek to be busy, but was not prepared for the amount of hikers that were already there. As we left the AT and entered into the camping area, the trail widen. It was so wide that a tent could be on the side of the trail and still leave room for hikers to get by. There were tents and hammocks everywhere! If it was a relatively flat spot it had a tent on it, and even some that were not so flat. The hikers that we had been leapfrogging with the past couple days saw us looking for somewhere to call home. They were nice enough to invite us over and allow us to join them. There were four tents already set up but in close proximity of each other. There was just enough room between them for one more tent. Cuppa tea was able to find a couple trees just a few feet away for her hammock, but it was on a downhill slope. According to AWOL's guide, there are 6 tent sites at Lance Creek. In our small section alone, there were five tents and two hammocks in a space that was probably designed for no more than one tent. With so many people around, going the bathroom was challenge, to say the least....Throughout the day, while I would be talking to some of the thru hikers, they would ask me if I was hiking with CuppaTea. After several conversations, someone said ""you should be Crumpet because that's what goes with Tea."" It's stuck! We did meet some great people, had some great conversations, and just generally enjoyed just being on the trail despite the close quarters. Many of the hikers around us were young. Several had just either graduated college or finished their masters degrees. They were taking the time to just enjoy life and/or trying to decide what the next chapter should be. One that I will always remember is an awesome young lady named Rachel, who is caring a plastic ukulele with her on her hike. She had downloaded some chords and music to her phone and was learning how to play the ukulele while she hiked the AT. I want to wish those hikers I met these past few days all the best on your hike:Melanie and her awesome dog, RadleyEukelady - RachelWolfSam from New JerseyMcIverOlder DogRowalwa","Gooch Gap

Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531031,"I slept well and woke up around 7:00 am. As I knew we weren't in a big hurry to leave, I just laid there listening to the sounds of hikers breaking camp. There was the occasional hiss from an deflating air pad. There was a ""poof"" of someone lighting up their stove. There was the conversation of a couple deciding on what they would be having for breakfast. The clack of tent poles being broken down. The swish of sil nylon. It sounded pretty busy outside my tent. As I heard the first of our group say goodbye to the others, I figured it was time to get up. We were the last out of camp but that suited us just fine. We knew we had Blood Mountain ahead of us but a hot shower and a salmon dinner waiting on the other side. We climbed most of the day (felt like it anyway). Near the top of Blood Mountain, we stopped to take a break. Three young ladies on a day hike were walking by. The smallest of the three, pointing to CuppaTea's pack, asked ""is it heavy?"" Cuppa Tea invited her to pick it up.   The girl was small and thin and we mentioned that the pack probably weighed more than she did. She grabbed the pack by the shoulder strap and pulled. She practically fell over without budging the pack an inch. One of the other girls picked up the pack and was able to get it on.   She was saying it wasn't so bad. We invited her to for walk up the hill a bit. She politely declined. It was funny! They were very curious and Cuppa Tea answered all their questions. It was another ""trail celebrity"" moment.   We make it to the top of Blood Mountain. According to Wikipedia, ""Blood Mountain is the highest peak on the Georgia section of the Appalachian Trail and the sixth-tallest mountain in Georgia, with an elevation of 4,458 feet (1,359 m)...Blood Mountain is the high point of the Apalachicola River watershed via the Chattahoochee River, making the mountain the highest point of any land draining ultimately to the state of Florida."" I have to say, I felt every inch of that mountain. There was no view on top as it was a cloudy day. The trail down consisted of large boulders that looked like they dropped off the edge. They didn't, but it did require hiking down the face of rocks to the next level below. Steep step downs had my knees screaming at me. To make matters worse, it started to sprinkle. ""We're not far from Neels Gap"", I thought. I would say we weren't more than a half a mile away and it started pouring. Figures... We were soaked! We arrived at Neels Gap and it wasn't long before we were on our way to the hostel. We were told we were sharing a bunk room with two young men. These two kids couldn't have been more apart in terms of their preparation for the trail. One had spent a couple years in the Army and had a good idea of the gear he needed, had, and how it all worked. The other was still unpacking new gear from their packaging, organizing ALOT of nutrigrain bars and pop tarts, and had asked us if we used a water bladder and how we put it inside our packs. Unfortunately, we never heard later how either one was doing on the trail.We were up when the roster crowed...(literally)
It was time for me to head home. This short section with CuppaTea was coming to an end.","Lance Creek

Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531038,"I picked up CuppaTea, Sprinkle Toes, Crisco, and Bushwacker late in the afternoon and whisked them off to our timeshare in Gatlinburg. They spent the evening showering and doing laundry. The following day I would drive Sprinkle Toes and Crisco back to the trail and take Bushwacker back to Fontana Lodge as he was trying to meet up with a friend. I did want to make sure they had a good breakfast, so I prepared scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, coffee, orange juice, grapes, bananas. I did find it funny that one of the things that each one f them said was, ""mmmm...toast!"" I even think Bushwacker had 4 or 5 pieces of toast. There wasn't much left! LOL It was so fun feeding them! After breakfast, I drove them back to Fontana Lodge. As it was an hour drive one way, it gave CuppaTea plenty of time to tackle her town chores.When I returned, she was in full ""zero day"" mode. She was reclining on the couch, with a cup of tea in hand. She had jumped into the jacuzzi tub while I was gone. She joked that, even after two showers, she still left a ring around the bathtub. LOL. With a jacuzzi, comfy bed, clean clothes and a great bbq place, CuppaTea was enticed to stay and enjoy another zero.","Gatlinburg

Stocked with sodas, gatorade, water, chips, cookies, celery, carrots, avocados, chocolates, and jelly beans. We set up in Newfound Gap across from where hikers coming north enter into the parking lot, and right next where they continue up the trail. It was so cool seeing a smile come to their faces as they come up the trail, realize they are at a parking lot, and then seeing someone wave to them to come over.

Shutterbug (formerly known as Crumpet),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531053,"Time to hit the trail! My husband drove us to Newfound Gap where I would start my section hike and Cuppa Tea would continue her thru hike. We came across a church group in the parking lot performing trail magic. I struck up a conversation and found out that they perform trail magic on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. (We did trail magic yesterday - Wednesday). As my husband was headed home and I was hitting the trail, we asked if they would like the rest of a box of chips to add to their trail magic. They said ""Absolutely!"" A HUGE Thank you to all who provide trail magic to tired and thirsty hikers. Soon, it was time to head out. We donned our packs, I kissed my hubby goodbye and we headed up the trail. We past visitors taking pictures of standing on the Appalachian Trail. It was a short 3 mile hike up to Ice Water Spring shelter. The view was beautiful and I spent a moment just looking out and taking it all in. DieHard was the only hiker at the shelter when we arrived, but by the time it got dark, it was a busy shelter.Some time in the evening, I had heard some hikers come in. Turns out, it was a group of young hikers that had been drinking in Gatlinburg and decided to continue to drink as they made their way to the shelter. I'm such a lightweight. There is no way I could drink, then hike, or worse, drink AND hike. They were in no condition to hike when we set off the next morning. One was still in his tent, asking us not to talk so loud.

I had seen pictures of the narrow trail and the drop off on the side of the trail. As CuppaTea is not fond of heights, I was concerned if she would be all right with it. She took like a champ! She even paused for a picture (no, she wasn't about to climb up the rocks). We had beautiful weather and the views were amazing. We made it to Pecks Corner shelter mid-afternoon. Diehard and the couple from Germany were at the shelter. Shortly after our arrival, the Ridgerunner, Chloe, arrived. CuppaTea and I picked a couple of spots on the upper level of the shelter and went about doing camp chores. By the time the sun was setting, it was a full house. As I laid there trying to get comfortable and fall asleep, I was taking inventory of the ""symphony"" of sounds in the shelter. There was coughing, snoring, sneezing, someone was having some sort of nightmare and was talking in their sleep, someone else was trying to wake the other person. There was the crinkle of an air mattress. In fact, I believed I noticed that when one person would roll over and send crinkling sounds throughout the shelter, several other people would take advantage of the interruption and roll over an adjust too. I finally fell asleep and actually think I had a good night's sleep. Unfortunately, CuppaTea didn't ...","Icewater Spring shelter
