Werner Schmidt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583929,"This blog is about the hopefully amazing journey and adventure of Werner Schmidt.  Written by me (Moe, his wife) as it is told to me.As for todays entry he is still home and very restless, excited and anxious all at the same time.  I've watched him pack, empty and repack so many times I think he is going to ware out his backpack before he leaves.  We are busy trying to get ready for my part in all this.  I have to know where and how to send him provisions on the trail.  I have a list of his equipment and where it was purchased incase he needs to replace something like his boots or clothes. I need to know all the basics on maintenance of the house  and where the food is for the cat, birds, raccoons and the opossum that is injured and has adopted us.  I just asked him how he feels and he said ""Jittery"".  Its the packing.Happy TrailsWerner & Moe ","

Werner Schmidt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584344,"There really isn't a lot to report on him.  He called Tuesday night and said the flight was fine and they were in a shelter for the night. He called again on Thursday.  He was so out of breath after climbing 600 steps up to the starting point.  He only talked for a few minutes and said ""This is really hard but, I am going to do this.""  I say more power to him. Mean while back here at the ranch, we seem to have a opossum that has adopted us.  It now lives in under the wood pile next to the house.  It will actually climb up to my living room window in the afternoon and eat any left over cat food while my cat is on the inside hissing at it.  Anyone know how to get rid of it?Hopefully I'll have more updates soon.Night all,MoeP.S. Don't forget to check out his blog at trailjournals.com/wsHe will try to write in when he can.","
