Ryan Youngs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567761,"Instead of sitting in my room aimlessly staring at all my gear, as i find myself doing more than id like to admit, i figured i would write my first entry! Here goes nothing.
     I almost find a pride in telling people that i will be attemting to thru hike the Appalchian trail. Expecting for them to be proud of me. Usually i just get a confused look and a ""why?""
    For years i have been drawn into the idea of thru hiking. The Appalchian trail in particular, but i never really asked myself why. Now that my dream of hiking the trail is a reality that question became very real to me.
Why leave the comforts of my home?
Why leave my car behimd and take my feet into a 3mph world?
Why leave my bed and home cooked meals behind me?
   Ill tell you why. Its because when i am out in the wilderness a feeling that im sure all of us share rushes through me. I cant even explain it. I feel so alive,alert, at peace. I feel like at that moment in time, i was meant to be there.  And every time i leave i cant help but feel like i should be staying.
   I want to hike the Appalchian trail because i feel trapped in my life right now. Not that my life is bad by any means. I just feel like i missed a lot of opportunities and havnt had many accomplishments.  I feel like things kind of just happened and i didnt fully control them. This is a chance for me to disconnect from that and grab the reigns back.
   The feeling i get knowing that everything i need to live is on my back is absolutely amazing. A feeling of freedom i have never felt before.
     I want to see America as it was before Man got ahold of it, experience places most people will never see. I want to see all the little mountain towns and the people that live there. I cant wait to meet fellow hikers! I cant wait to see how the trials and tribulations of the trail change me as a person.  I CANT WAIT FOR THIS JOURNEY TO START!!
 Those are only a few reasons i want to hike the A.T, most of them i cant even put into words. 
  Hopefully i get better at these entries as time goes on. Until next time! See ya",,View Entry,"Jun 07, Wed",0
Ryan Youngs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580900,"Lets be honest, I started counting days a long time ago. I tried to forget to let the time go by faster but no luck, it's one of the first thing that comes into my mind every morning. This hike has always felt very real to me but for some reason now that we are at 100 days its like wow! i cant help but think ""damn dude, in 100 days you will be following your dream of hiking the A.T""  I have spent the last 6 months really fine tuning my gear and testing out different things to see what i feel works best for me. after multiple backpacking trips in the White Mountains of New Hampshire and Maine i feel confident with the gear i have and my physical capabilities. I actually slept in my tent out in the yard a couple weeks back because I knew the temps would be dropping down into the single digits. I figured i would rather test the limits of my sleeping bag in my yard rather than in the middle of the Appalachian mountains! As i expected I was nice and warm through the night.  Definitely comforting because I am expecting some very cold weather at the beginning of my hike.  I will be flying out of Boston with my mother and father on March 9th. We will be staying at the falls lodge that night and I will be starting my hike the morning of the 10th. My parents are flying to Punta Cana from Georgia so I am ready to start regardless of the weather that day. obviously if it is to gnarly I will make arrangements to put it off for another day of two. 
        Well now that I feel I have prepared for all the things I can I will let everything else come at me as it pleases and deal with it when the time come. All of the unknown factors are exciting to me!! This will be my first hike of this length and I am so grateful that I will be spending an extended period of time on the trail, I am grateful for anyone who supported my decision and helped me bring it to life, and I am grateful that I am crazy, adventurous and completely cool with having insanely awesome ideas! for anyone taking the time to read this I thank you and I cant wait to get this started and share my journey with you!!!!

Ryan Youngs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581078,"For as long as i can remember I have had visions of traveling long distances, but not like the average person does. My imagination always had me doing it on foot or on a bike. I've had these ideas long before I knew what thru hiking was.  I remember being really young, probably 9 or 10 and i was cruising around on my bike. while speeding down my street I thought it would be so cool to just keep going, ""keep going until i see palm trees i thought"". That memory stuck with me, to the point when I was 19 years old I convinced my friend Devyn that we would set up our bikes for long distance travel and pedal off to California. We had no plan, and we sure as hell had no money.  Well i had 20 dollars but that was gone two towns later.  Needless to say i chalked that one up as a major failure. The only reason I bring it up is so you have an idea of the type of ideas I have. Shortly after I really started to get into hiking and backpacking and just overall living a healthier lifestyle in general. And boy am I glad I did, It really helped get me on track!
              After running into many thru hikers on my frequent trips to the White Mountains I knew hiking the Appalachian Trail was something I really wanted to do.  The idea sounded crazy to me so I could only imagine how it was going to sound to my family, friends and my boss.  For a couple weeks I kept it a secret looking up everything I could on hiking the trail in its entirety. I was finally 100% in my head I knew this was something i was going to do so I told my parents. At first i'm not sure they really understood what I was talking about and what I was preparing to do.  After all they have been by my side for all of my crazy ideas since day one.  Day in and day out I would tell them things I was learning about the trail and eventually I think they got the point that I was actually planning a hike from Georgia to Maine. Just like every other time they have been very supportive of my plans and helped me make it a reality.  Telling my boss was definitely A little scary but surprisingly it went very smoothly. He is all about the hike and cant wait to follow along on my journey. At the beginning of planning I was honestly super stressed out and overwhelmed. Despite all of my hiking experience I felt lost. After alot of research all of that got better and I started to feel a little more comfortable and I realized I was just over planning. Obviously there are aspects of my hike I can control, like my gear which I have tested out In all different conditions to make sure it worked well for me. There are also so many aspects that I can't control. That being said I do not have a set in stone itinerary on the trail.  I am going to go out there and go with the flow. 
           Just over three months until I get this all started, I know the time will fly by but at times it feels like it will never come! Every day I feel so lucky that I will be in the mountains having an unbelievable experience. I cant wait to share this with everyone! Maybe even motivate other people to get outside and explore how awesome the earth is. Thankyou to anyone who is taking the time to read these. Follow your dreams whatever they are and never worry what other people will think of them! 
         See you on the trail!!!!!",,View Entry,"Dec 06, Wed",0
Ryan Youngs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581178,"I am constantly being asked questions about my hike from my family and friends, I have been asked so many different questions but usually it is the same questions from everyone.  Since I have a lot of friends and family that will be following my hike on here I will take this time to answer some of those questions.  Some of these questions might seem pretty obvious but remember a lot of my family has never heard of thru-hiking.

What is thru-hiking?
   Well this answer really can be different for everyone.  Everyone has their own idea on what a thru-hike is and to me there is no right or wrong answer. Hike your own hike is the way I Iook at it.  For me Thru-hiking is hiking the entirety of a long distance trail on foot from the beginning to the end.  In this case we are talking the Appalachian Trail.  A 2189 mile trail from Springer Mountian in Georgia to Mt.Katahdin in Maine crossing 14 states in that span.

Are you hiking alone?
  Yes, I will technically be hiking alone.  I will be getting dropped off in Georgia by myself and starting the trail alone. At the same time I will not be alone, there are many other that are doing this and starting on the same day as me.  We will all be sharing the shelters together and going to some of the same towns.  I am sure I will make some great friends out there and get pretty close to the ones I share a pace with, I really look forward to making new friends.  All in all i will be doing this hike ""solo"" and hiking the way I want to meeting new people as I go.

Are you bringing a gun/self protection?
 Absolutely not, well I have a classic swiss army knife that I might be able to cut a block of cheese with but I am not bringing it out there for a means of protection.  I am not afraid of wildlife, I respect wildlife and keep my distance from any wild animal.  If you have basic knowledge bears are rarely a threat to hikers.  I still have faith in humanity I know there are so many good people in the world and am not afraid of running into bad people on the trail. I'm sure I may encounter a shady character on the way and I truly trust my judgment in those situation. 

What about the bears?
  The football team??

Where will you be getting food/water?
   My plan is pretty simple.  I only plan to send resupplies to two locations and that isn't even a definite. The two locations are before the Great Smokey Mountains and before the 100 mile wilderness in Maine.  Other than that I will be resupplying my food in towns along the trail.  Some of the towns are right on the trail and some of the towns are miles off the trail.  In those situations I will be throwing up the thumb and trying to get a hitch into town. The establishments I will be resupplying in range from gas stations to wal-mart. That being said I am planning on being very flexible with the food I have available to me and trying my best to keep some sort of nutrition in the mix as I feel that will be crucial to my success. The water is pretty simple. I will drink water from pretty much anywhere lakes,rivers,puddles literally anywhere if i am thirsty enough. I use a simple micro fiber filter and knock on wood it has kept me from getting sick so far.

What about your job?
  To me the answer to this was very simple. I knew having a job was crucial to me making this trip happen but at the same time this trip is more important to me than working.  I was fully prepared to quit my job if it came down to that, luckily it didn't and my boss is very supportive of the whole thing. I will still have a job when I get home.

How much does it cost?
    When I decided I wanted to do this I was pretty afraid that I was going to be unable to save the money I would need.  Saving money and me do not get along! I have never been able to save much money. Spending money and doing fun things is more my style.  This trip was different I realized pretty quick that I was not having any problem saving money, for the first time ever it seemed easy.  That just goes to show how much this means to me.  After trying out different gear and buying a lot of lighter options to shave down my weight I have spent roughly $2400 on gear.  I plan on being pretty frugal with my money on the trail and not going to crazy when i get into towns, that being said I plan on spending around $3000 on the trail. 

Hopefully this clears up anything you were wondering about my hike! Thank you for reading and thank you for the kind words in my guest book! 86 more days people. see you on the trail!!!!

Ryan Youngs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581825,"As the days slip away and my wait time is slowly disappearing everything is becoming so much more real.  Everything I do in my day to day life is somehow linked to the trail.  I seriously can't get the trail out of my head.  I guess it's no different from the past year and a half but as my start date gets closer it truly is the only thing on my mind.  I am a victim of ""Springer fever"" and i have it bad.  As time has gone on the things I think about have changed.  At the beginning my thoughts were all over the place and very overwhelming mostly due to my lack of knowledge.  Luckily for me a lot of that has changed in the past 13 months.  Every day putting so much time in to researching the trail, gear, and thru hiking in general. I wont lie overall just trying to plan things to hard. The more I learn and understand things I realized with the base knowledge and skills I have, getting out there and going with the flow is my best bet.  I was going as far as making a day to day itinerary, doing that made this whole thing feel more like a vacation and less like an adventure so in the trash all that stuff went.  After all, my entire life I have embraced the go with the flow mentality, why would I change that now? dont worry, i'm not.  Ever since I have made this idea public people have said "" wow, this will be an adventure of a lifetime"" but to me I dont want to look at it that way.  That saying makes me feel like I wont top this adventure or have many more like it in my lifetime. Instead I like to say ""this will be the start of a lifetime of adventure"" and that it will.  Planning this trip and having this trip in my future has really made me a happier person, it has given me a purpose, i'll be damned if I don't spend the rest of my life doing this.  So rich with experiences that being rich with money never mattered.  I know there are so many people out there that want to do something like this and never will for a number of reasons.  Whatever is  holding you back cut it free believe me!  maybe you are afraid of straying away from a ""normal"" job and life, or maybe you are afraid your family and friends will think you have lost your mind, which they most likely will.  The only thing that matters is what you truly want, after all it is your life and you only have one to live so my suggestion to you is don't spend to much of it living the way someone else wants you to.  Looking around its easy to see people living a ""normal"" life and I know that it's not for me.  This is the start of an amazing life filled with adventure!!! I hope I can inspire just one other to do the same. Just because everyone is swimming with the flow of the river doesn't mean you cant swim against it! Lets live!! Well that is it for now, I am just itching so bad to get out there I felt writing something on here would ease that a little. I really want to thank all my friends and family and everyone else for giving me so much encouragement and support.  you guys are very important to me, you are my support system and have the power to help me have an easier time embracing the suck.  To the class of 2018 this is our year!!!!

Ryan Youngs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582177,"Over the past 6 months I have done many shakedown hikes.  For my friends and family who don't know what that is, it is a smaller backpacking trip where I would carry all of the same gear that i plan to carry on the Appalachian Trail. While out on the trail I would pay close attention to the gear I felt would be no use to me and the gear that just didn't fit into my style of hiking. After many of these hikes I feel I have my pack dialed in, but I am sure the longer i am out there I will find many more things that are not worth carrying. 
                 About mid summer I had a spur of the moment idea to hike the Massachusetts Midstate Trail from end to end.  The trail spans 95 miles from Rhode Island to New Hampshire right through the middle of the state.  I was born and raised in central MA so the idea of hiking through it was pretty intriguing to me. The real kicker was that I only had three days to complete the trail. I was pretty confident in my athleticism that this would be something that I would be able to accomplish but at the same time I really had no idea if I could hike 95 miles in three days. Shortly after making my plans public my childhood friend Zach reached out to me and said he was interested in hiking the trail with me, I was pretty excited that I would have some company on this trek.  Now Zach is a complete stud athlete but didn't have any backpacking experience so I spent a lot of time explaining to him what this trip would entail and the type of mileage we were going to be hiking.  To my surprise he was still on board and just as amped as I was to hike this trail.  At this point we both made arrangements to get dropped off at the southern terminus and we were ready to go!!! The day before my hike I had a big pit in my stomach and sweaty palms. I was completely nervous, not that something bad was going to happen but that I wouldn't be able to hike the trail in the time I had and that maybe I bit off more than I could chew. 
              It was a Thursday morning when my dad was driving me to the trail head, as we got more and more to the middle of no where I think he really started to think I was crazy. It was 7 in the morning when he dropped me off in an empty parking lot. Still waiting for my friend to show up I was sitting there alone and was in awe about what I was about to do.  Shortly after Zach was dropped off by his girlfriend who I am positive though I was out of my mind!!!
            Just like that we were off, and almost instantly I felt A sense of freedom I have never felt before! We were both in great spirits and ready to do this.  Our goal was to hike 32 miles to the Sibley Farms tent site.  Prior to this I have hiked many big mileage days but this was a first for zach.  I was positive he was going to be able to do it giving he is in great shape.  We were making great time and ticking off the miles with A smile on our faces. We ran into a few speed bumps on our first day, the biggest I could remember was the lack of water on the trail which was definitely a problem.  Luckily for us we met many kind people that gave us water to make sure we were okay. At about mile 25 fatigue was definitely starting to kick in and I could notice the same was happening to zach.  The miles were no longer coming as easy and the smiles were gone for the day.  I was doing my best to speak words of encouragement to zach who was dealing with some serious blister problems on his feet, I could see the pain on his face. It was about 8 o'clock when we arrived to Sibley Farms and the sun had gone down. Due to it being dark out and both of us being in a state of delirium we were unable to find the designated camp site and decide to pitch our tent in the middle of a field.  As we sat there and ate our dinner it was pretty clear that Zach's trip was all over, his feet were in very rough shape.  Before going to bed he made up his mind that he would be getting picked up in the morning and I would be finishing this up alone.  As we laid there and started to doze off we realized that we were in the middle of a field that had quite the wildlife population at night!  first we heard Fischer cats over by our food bag, then we heard a pack of coyotes howling back and forth to each other slowly getting closer to our tent until finally all of them were no more than 100 feet from the tent going absolutely insane, my guess is that they had just snagged their meal for the night.  The situation was definitely unnerving but I am really glad I got to experience and listen to the coyotes so closely.  
            We woke up with the sun the next morning, and packed up our dew covered gear.  Zach and I said our goodbyes and he gave me alot of words of encouragement to make it to the end and keep trekking on.  Just like that I was heading into the field my myself, within 5 minutes my shorts and my shoes were soaked through from all of the dew but I was fine with that, I didn't have a worry in the world and was looking forward to meeting my pep at a road crossing in a few miles to get some fresh food.  As far as my plans went for the day I didnt really have any besides hike as far as I possibly could so i didn't have to do to many miles on my final day of hiking. I hiked all day with very few breaks. the water situation on this day was even worst!! forcing me to drink water from some pretty muddy puddles, and getting pretty dehydrated at one point. As I walked on I was pretty pleased with how much ground I was covering.  as the sun was setting and I was losing the momentum I had at mile 39 for the day.  I was about to try and find a place to set up camp for the day when I looked up and saw the first mountain of the hike, Mt. Wachusett.  I made up my mind pretty quickly that I was going to push to the summit and set my tent up, up there despite having to hike another 5 miles.  By the time I reached the summit I was 44 miles in for the day and got there just in time for the sunset, It was truly amazing. I went to bed with a very sore body and a sense of ease that I only had to hike 19 miles in the morning to reach the New  Hampshire border and finish the trail up. My plan was to have my pep meet me at Mt. Watatic when I was done and bring me back home. I made sure I turned my phone off before going to bed to assure I would be able to use it in the morning to set up arrangements for him to be there.
              As I woke up on day 3 I was blessed with an amazing sunrise that really made me get emotional.  I just feel so lucky to live moments like that.  While hiking down Mt, Wachusett that morning I went to turn my phone on, but to my surprise it was completely dead.  my guess is the cold during the night drained the battery.  I was a little stressed out about this situation and was unsure how to get a hold of my family to make arrangements to get home from New Hampshire.  When I got closer to the ski lodge i saw a man standing out front.  I asked him if I could used his phone. he responded "" I don't have one on me"".  I figured he just said that because of my appearance and how bad I smelled. I didn't let up though I explained to him my situation and being a fellow hiker he instantly understood.  My plan was to write down my mother's phone number so he could contact her when he got home and have my pep come get me, we only had one problem we had nothing to write on and nothing to write with.  This is when I did something pretty gross and starting rummaging through the over flowing trash cans. after about ten minutes of doing that I found a napkin and a pen. I jotted down my mother's info and deciding sending my pep to Mt. Watatic around three would work.  I kept telling him over and over how important it was that he made that phone call for me.  I hiked off from the lodge and was pushing north to New Hampshire but I had a weird feeling that he might not make the call and that I would be waiting with no ride, so the next person I ran into was an older gentleman walking his dog.  I explained my situation to him just as I did an hour earlier to the other guy, So I now had a cell phone but there was no service  I insisted that I get in his car and we drive to service and then he could drop me back off where i left off.  To my surprise he was completely cool with it.  I had finally got a hold of my mom and she explained to me how someone else had just called her and told her the same thing. I was definitely thankful for all of the people who were willing to go out of there way to help me. 
            All day I hiked as fast as I could to try and get to the end by three so my pep wouldn't have to wait around for me. keep in mind I had no phone or watch so I was never able to check the time and see how I was doing so like a mad man I hiked on.  I arrived to a full parking lot at Mt. Watatic with only 2 more miles to go to finish my hike. I asked the first person I saw what time it was and they answered ""3 o'clock"", I couldnt help but laugh at how spot on I was of when I would be arriving there. Almost simultaneously I heard someone yell ""hey Ry"" which I knew instantly was my pep. I really wanted my pep to finish up the trail with me, and he did.  We walked the last couple miles together and as I was approaching the Northern terminus it felt like my chest filled up with air and I got pretty emotional. I was proud of myself for completing the trail and was pleased with how well all my gear performed.  The feeling of finishing that trail was completely amazing and I cant even imagine how it will feel to finish the trail like the A.T.  Just the though of it gives me the chills!!!
          Well I hope you all enjoyed reading about my hike on the Midstate Trail and I seriously cant wait to share My adventure on the Appalachian Trail with you.  I want to thank each and everyone of you for reading my journal and all the positive feedback I get from it!!

Ryan Youngs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583499,"Nine days from now I will be taking my first steps on the Appalachian Trail.  For so long I have anticipated how I would feel as the wait dwindled to single digits, and here I am.  I am feeling mostly excited. probably more excited than I have ever been. I'm also A little nervous, not necessarily about any one thing just all of it in general. I have put so much time into this trip and  worked really hard to make it happen, and I know very soon all of that is going to be tested to the max. I am ready to be tested and very excited for this challenge and everything I am about to experience. 
      On another note I am having A going away party with all of my family in Boston. I cant wait to see everyone and eat some good food!! and probably answer A million questions.  I am lucky to have my family be so supportive of my hike, but not just my family, all of my friends and even people I don't know are rooting me on and offering to help in any way they can.  It really is a good feeling and I know when I am physically and mentally defeated, thinking of all the people rooting for me will keep me going.  Over the last couple weeks I was really worried about how I was going to get my backpack down to Georgia.  At first the plane seemed like the logical explanation but the more I thought about it the more I was worried it would get misplaced or damaged in the process.  I ended up shipping the bag from A local UPS store to a UPS store down in Georgia where my mothers friend Nadine is going to pick it up for me and hold on to it. This idea seemed much safer to me and after watching the employee wrap my pack up I felt much better.  Although still a little apprehensive of letting my house for the next six months leave my possession. For now I am just trying to stay busy so the time will go by and I am standing on Springer.
       Well that is all for now. Thank you for taking the time to read my journal and following my journey.  All of your support means so much to me! Alright well next time I update the journal will be at Amicalola Falls lodge as I I look through my pack one last time before hitting the trail.  If you are interested in seeing photo updates from the trail go check out my Instagram @northbound_ryan

Ryan Youngs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584286,"I walked down to the breakfast buffet at the lodge to eat one last warm meal before they drove me to Springer mountain. Despite knowing it was important to get some food in me I was only able to eat a very small amount.  As my parents drove me down the long dirt road to Springer I was filled with all types of emotions. I couldn't believe it was finally happening.
   We finally got there and said our goodbyes and just like that i was off to the top of Springer. None of it felt real at first. When I finally got up there I enjoyed it for a few minutes. I have been wanting to stand at this exact spot for so long!!
     Without much thought I started off and north I went making my way back down Springer. We had rain coming in that day so I stopped around noon to set my tent up  before it started. No sooner did I put my last tent stake in did the rain start coming down. I ate some food and got in side my tent. I was cooped up in there for 16 hours as we experienced some really heavy rain. This is what I've been waiting for the rain was no suprise to me. Between the rain hitting my tent and the owls going back and forth I was asleep in no time.
