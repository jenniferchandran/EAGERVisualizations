  After leaving the Smokies you still climb like you are in them.We did over 20 miles the day before and wanted to take it slow.But then I looked at my map and saw Max patch was coming up.This is one of the places I really wanted to stay on top of if we caught it on a clear day.We got the clear day so that meant we had to do 17 miles today to get to this wonderful spot.But we are hurting because there was a lot of climbing to get here.
   It’s pretty windy and it’s going to be cold up here tonight.There are no trees to shelter you.And we are at 4500ft.It is so worth it though.While waiting for the sunset I was able to talk to some really nice people from Kentucky.They were really impressed and wanted to have there pictures taken with me,a dirty,smelly thru hiker.Feels kind of cool.Another nice couple from Ohio were great company for a while too.Gets lonely a little so I have been talking to people way more  than I usually do.

Bruce Hadley aka Crazy Diamond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586638,So during the night I really started wondering if it was a smart idea tenting up here on Max patch.It got really cold!We knew what we were in for though and it was SO worth it to catch the sunrise right from my tent.A few day hikers came up with huge blankets to watch too    During the night we heard lots of owls and coyotes.     Heading down from Max patch is just as nice as going up.We met up with some fellow thru hikers who were asking us all about the night.Out of Everyone we were the only thru hikers who stayed up there.Glad we did.It definitely took me about an hour to get the feeling back in my hands from being so cold as we hiked down     Today was really nice rolling terrain.Not so many views but just amazing open forests and nice little streams.Really nice relaxing day listening to some of my favorite music.Feeling like I don’t deserve all of this.Too good to be true.I am so lucky to have a wife that gets how much I love this.Love her so much for this and everything else she does for me.   Spending the night near Deer park shelter .Just met a really great guy from Florida .Dog Whisperer is his name.He is out here to grieve over the loss of his son who died in a whitewater raft accident recently.I can see the pain in his eyes and feel so bad for him.Really great guy and I hope he gets everything out of this trip he needs.  We are so much warmer tonight.I can feel a really deep sleep approaching.Probably because I froze last night and didn’t sleep much    Really looking forward to tomorrow.Its my birthday and we will be staying over in Hot Springs!Beer and real food are all I think about lately     Loving hearing from you all .Thanks,"Max patch

   We called Midnight back and he picked us up and brought us to a store so we could get some beers for later.He was telling us all about the hostel and that we could sleep just about anywhere we wanted.The hostel is a huge 6 car garage the owners converted into a place for thru hikers to stay.Midnight said he slept in the chicken coop before because it has a little loft above it.I asked if I could and he saidI should.So I did,it was awesome and quiet.The owners are extremely nice people and only take donations of what you can afford to pay.So many hikers here tonight.I know a lot of them and met and talked with lots of new ones.

   Trail followed many old roads today.Came across Red Jeep who was doing trail work.Really funny guy.I helped him saw an ash tree down that was ready to fall on the trail.Felt good to help and I really think I am going to volunteer to do trail work when this is al over.Will be in the Adirondacks though.

 Another really nice and sunny day.Trail started early with a really cool boardwalk that takes you through a long swampy section filled with many different kinds of birds.My wife would have loved it.Shes really into that kinda thing.
   After getting out of that section you start a climb called Stairway to heaven.Really fun steep climbing over many boulders the size of cars and trucks.I love this kind of hiking.Got to the top where it levels a bit and heard a branch crack to my right.I look over and there it is,finally,a bear close by.!!!He was a big one .He goes behind a big boulder and I see 2 more sets of ears poking up .3 bears!The first bear walks and crosses the trail pretty close to me.The other 2 stay put.It took bear # 1 a while to see me,when he did he stared for a minute and then slowly walked up the trail and away.I am so happy I saw him because he is the biggest one so far.Its really cool to be so close and watch them.

   Wasn’t much for views today.Did see some really cool wildlife.A really young tiny fawn and a lizard on a cliff.Lizard was brown but had the brightest blue tail.Really weird but cool looking.
   Was kind of cool to cross the NYS thruway-and watch the cars zoom by.Cool to me because I have driven under this bridge and always wondered if I would get the chance to hike the AT someday and be the one walking across.So happy I am here doing this even on a tough day like today.Hoping tomorrow I wake up and have more energy.Jumping Moose and Rocky are here tenting with us again tonight.They said they felt the same as me today about the humidity.Next 3 days are going to be close to 100degrees so we may cut our miles back a bit and not stress about getting too far.

Bruce Hadley aka Crazy Diamond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596409,"So I am back at it after a really great weekend home with my family.Was great seeing them.Last night went to Tedeschi Trucks concert in Saratoga.Such a great time with my Bethie and many friends.   Very muggy and hot first thing this morning.Statted off at Bear mtn park which was absolutely mobbed with people early.Couldnt get out of that crowd fast enough.The park and trail takes you through a zoo.It was closed so we took the bypass trail.Next was Bear mtn bridge which takes you across the Hudson River.Nice old suspension bridge.Great views of the Hudson .As soon as you cross the bridge the trail goes very steely up the next mountain.Was SO hot.Wondered how the hell I was going to make it through a whole day of the hellish heat.  Luckily for me the trail became quite easier after descending .Nice flat sections.Saw some more of those huge black snakes through here.Then after about 5 miles came to a road and thought I was seeing a mirage.A store ,and so close to the trail!So I went and bought a few slices of pizza and 4 big cans of beer.Drank 1 there and packed the rest for later.    Trail was pretty but no views at all.Thunder was rumbling all morning but with blue skies.About 2:30 the sky darkened dramatically quick.Then rain.Heavy ,heavy rain.I have to admit it felt so good after being so hot all day.The bad part was we were on a ridge and there was some seriously close and scary thunder and lightning going on.Nowhere to get shelter so just moved as fast as we could.Trail instantly becomes like a little river when it rains so hard and fast.Was one of those moments that make you think “is this how it’s gonna end for me?”I am weird a little and love the rush I get out of extreme weather conditions.Really strong winds are my favorite thing to be in..After about 45 minutes of walking through this intense storm that wouldn’t end we came to a parking area with a little tiny roof over a trailhead parking map.Storm just wouldn’t stop.We saw many cars go by and people were actually pointing and laughing that we were out in the storm huddled under the small roof.Welcome back to NY where most people are rotten  in my opinion.People can be so mean.I guarantee if this happened down south on the trail someone would have offered to help out or take us into town or something.One nice lady did stop out of probably 50 or more cars and offered us an umbrella.Was sweet but I told her we were beyond soaked so no point.Numb and I did have some laughs during this whole thing though.You can’t fight these things on the trail.Learn to love it or you will never have a chance to finish.Biscuits showed up and huddled with us for a while.Really cool young guy from Michigan.  We had some daylight left after the storm so we decided to try to dry out a little while hiking as we headed north.It helped a little .Stream crossings were really high and the trail was slick.Was getting late so we found a flat spot and set up our tents almost right on the trail.Bugs were out in full force.I carry 100% Deet.My skin may fall off,but hey,I won’t get bit so much.We ate really quick and jumped into our tents to get away from the bugs.And I forgot all about the beers I carried out from earlier.Tasted SO great    Crazy day of heat,rain,and bugs.Really happy to be back out here though.Everyday tests you and makes you stronger out here I think.","Home

   Started pretty early to try hiking while cooler.Still muggy but not even close to yesterday.First cool spot today was Shenanadoah mtn.There is a 9/11 memorial flag painted on top.Nice breeze felt so great too.Next stop was RPH shelter.Got water and talked to T time and Peek.We met them before a few weeks back.Really nice young couple who are in total love.They are getting married in September after the trail.They have been together for 8 years but wanted to make this the final test on how they would get along living together .They are going to make it,happy for them!While there a cool guy who lives next to this shelter came and talked for quite a while.He was doing his own study and has asked over 1000 people “Do you think people are nice?”And the second question was “what do you think most people answered?”.Sounds like a simple thing but we got deep into it all and he was super interesting to talk to.My answer was Yes I do think most people are nice.Some people just don’t know how to be.I have met some of the nicest people I have ever known on this trip on the trail and in towns.The people I have met I actually love more than the trail itself.
    Trail was pretty rugged all day with not much to see.Lots of really cool old stone walls through the forest.Massive 4 foot wide ones.Guessing it must have been farmland way back.Saw a snake eating a frog too.Poor frog was suffering . It’s whole body was in the snakes mouth and it looked terrified.I know your not supposed to mess with nature but I had to put it out of its misery.I put the end of my pole through it’s head while still in the snakes mouth.Made me sad to do it but just had to.Wanted to kill the snake but it is just doing what snakes do.I am a frog and toad lover so it was hard.
   Ended up doing a nice 20 miler today.Not going to say what I am doing for the next few days.Work related,causes problems if I say anything.Hoping to find a different job when I get back maybe.Will be back to journaling Monday.

   Very pretty trail all day.Lots of streams and nice woods.Maine junction is where the Long Trail goes north and the AT goes east after being the same trail for 100 miles.Last time I was at this junction when I did the Long Trail I wondered if I would ever do the AT someday and get to head east.I am here doing it!!
   Next stop was Gifford woods state park.A really cool 2016 thru hiker was giving out trail magic so I talked with him a while.He pretty much does tattoos half of the year to save money so he can just travel the rest of the year and hike all over.

  Hostel gave us a ride back to the trail head.Inside out and Pitboss opted to go for this long hike also.
  Wildcats are the first series of mountains today.Trail ascended very steeply over mostly rock slabs and faces right above Pinkham Notch and the road.Feels like you are hanging right over the road way down below.Really excellent view of the notch today.You go over 4 Wildcats.Very rugged hike.At the last one you can see way down into Carter notch and see Carter hut.Looks so tiny 1000 feet below.Steep climb down Wildcat to a beautiful pond and then a long steep climb up to Carter dome.Was really wishing I didn’t have so many beers last night right around here.And wondering why?Why did I choose to do 21 miles today?Summited Carter dome and then went on to Mt Hight.This is a really nice one with a rocky and open summit with great views of the Presidential range I did the day before.We didn’t stay long because we still had a long ways to go.Middle Carter and North Carter came next.Very rugged,rocky and sometimes deeply muddy trail to get there.Not complaining about any of this hike .Its seriously beautiful,but you really have to work for it for sure!.Descending off the Carters is really steep and wet.Then a pretty good climb again up to Mt Moriah.Another really pretty summit on this nice day.More steep descending off of Moriah.Down a ways you follow the Tattle river for miles until you hit Gotham.Really wish I had more time to go swimming in some deep holes along the way down.They were so inviting and clear and clean.It got like nighttime dark outside and started raining so swimming didn’t really matter much.Last 2 miles was easy and takes you right back to the hostel.We werevery happy to get through this tough section in about 11 hours.
  Back at the hostel we got cleaned up and ordered some take out food.I gave Wayward some money earlier to get me some beers for tonight and he came through.Sally Forth and Pancakes asked us all about the hike and how it went.Really nice ladies.Sally Forth made tacos and said we could have all of what she didn’t eat.Was SO good!Rambo Juice,Stretch,and Savage are all staying here tonight too.Thought they were way ahead of us.Had a great talk and laughs with Wayward mostly tonight.Really cool guy.

 I am gonna keep this journal short.Very wet and muddy all day.Some beautiful  swimming holes and cascades.Mostly flat all day.We knew we had to reach the Kennebec river before 2 if we wanted a ride across.The river is unpredictable because a dam upstream releases its waters during the day at different times.People have died trying to get across.We had to do 20 miles to get there and just made it with 5 minutes to spare.Was so happy because the last 5 miles we were really flying and my back was killing and it was tough.The ferryman was a really nice guy and helpful.

  We packed up in the dark and set out around 2:30 am.Sky is all lit up with beautiful bright stars so that’s a great sign.Rain is forecast for this afternoon.We headed down to the ranger station to drop all of the stuff from our packs we won’t need.My pack is so light it feels like it’s not even on.Just food,water,raincoat,and my good camera.
   Started up the Hunt trail which is the same as the AT.Passes by campsites so I tried to be really quiet at this early hour.Katahdin stream falls was really pretty lit up by the almost full moon.Its a big and powerful waterfall.The mist coming off of it kind of looked like crystally snowflakes in the moonlight.After the falls the trail gets steep,steeper,and holy shit steep!Starts off climbing in between and over little boulders.Then the boulders get bigger and steeper with rock faces you have to climb .Then it gets really cool.Once you are out and above the tree line it’s really fun.There are iron rungs and bars in the rock faces you need to pull yourself up with.Its real climbing.I really love climbing more than hiking so I was really loving al of it!And the stars above and moon lighting up all the mountains around me was spectacular.I will never forget how beautiful this morning was.One of my favorite moments on the trail.The steepness starts to ease off a little and you can see a ridge line you have to climb up still steeply.It was so cool looking in all directions and looking at the really rough looking mountains close by with their scars and massive rock faces.Way out in the distance were rows and rows of more gently sloped mountains.Hard to explain how beautiful it was under the moonlight.
  Once at th top of the ridge you come to the Table lands.Its a wide and flat area that has beautiful alpine vegetation and boulders.From here I could see the top ofKatahdin and the knife edge.Was a little bummed they were clouded in .The clouds were moving fast though so maybe they will blow over?Lenticular clouds mostly.Really cool to look at .Something really strange happened then.I noticed a really huge and thin ring of clouds circling the summit.It was slowly being pulled into the summit .I couldn’t believe what I was seeing so I pointed it out to Numb.He saw it!Never seen anything like it.The ring just got sucked right into the summit.So glad I saw it!Sun was also rising now and it turned all the clouds to a deep red and purple.The clouds on the summit lifted and separated and I saw the Katahdin sign.During all of this I was listening to my iPod.A very meaningful song came on that made me cry.I had it on shuffle so it was like it was meant to happen.
   Made it to the sign and three thru hikers we met the day before were celebrating and happy for us.They were all older guys like me so I am really happy for them.Took a bunch of pics for them.While that was going on Numb and I went to the summit cairn.Back in NY hiking friends of ours Rocky and Jumping Moose from Sweden gave me a rock they had from the Camino trail.They were having issues losing too much weight and had to leave.Asked me if I would bring it the rest of the way.I did!Ws my pleasure doing it for these great people.We made them a little video to show them.They were so happy!After that we got our summit pics.Was great timing because the sun and clouds in the background were stunning.Hard to explain how I felt at the sign.Extremely proud,so happy,so sad that it’s over,wondering what it will be like back in society,excited to see my wife,kids and friends.Kind of blocking it out of my mind that it’s finished for now.
   We had the whole mountain to ourselves so decided to stay a while.Numb sat by the summit cairn and I was itching to get back out on the knife edge I did some years back.It was windy and scary but that’s my favorite thing!Was amazing to see the sun sending rays all over far away mountains and lakes.Went about halfway and watched thin clouds come up from underneath the knife edge,blow over top,and straight down the other side.One of the coolest things I’ve ever seen!Slowly made my way back to the summit enjoying every minute.Made it back and Numb asked me to get more pics of him by the sign.I thought it would be cool to get one of me at the very top standing.Made my way there.Bad idea because there isn’t much to balance on.A gust of wind knocked me off balance and I knew I was in trouble.Then a bigger gust blew me off and backwards a ways.Falling....felt like I was never gonna land.I did.On my back and right arm on jagged rocks.Numb runs around to find me in shock I think.His eyes were huge.From where he was talking the picture it looked like there was a huge drop off.It probably is about 10 feet.I jumped up in no pain.Just some scrapes on my legs and back.After a few minutes my right forearm really started hurting.Cant move it or put pressure on it without severe pain.Think it’s broken.
   Started raining a cold rain then.We had to go down super steep Abol slide trail.I was panicking inside because I knew it was going to be hard without using my right arm .Had to go at a snails pace and take deep breaths all the way.Was agony.Stopped raining and I concentrated on the beautiful views on the way down.And I made it!!??Back at the ranger station waiting for Beth and Leah to get us.None of this seems real.I thru hiked the AT and it’s over","The Birches lean to and campsite
