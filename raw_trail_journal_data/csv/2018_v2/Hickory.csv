Hickory,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579427,"On long treks I have been asked how my gear performed. I, myself, am my own best piece of gear. I must keep myself fit and healthy by regular training, good rest and a smart diet. Oh, I pay attention to ""gear-heads"" who can spew statistics ad nauseum about equipment. When the gear I already have wears out, I will make informed choices about replacements. My body, though, becomes stronger as I push myself to get my gear down the trail.  Gear does not get me down the trail. I walk or hike two or three hours every day, preferably on a trail. I backpack when I can, now. I will intensify my training in December when I will set weekly mileage goals.  The best I can do (while training in Indiana) to prepare for an AT thru-hike is to get myself into good pre-condition for the trail. I will earn my trail legs in about three weeks on the AT. For now, keep on trekking!",,View Entry,"Oct 13, Fri",0
Hickory,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580963,"Less than three months until I begin my 5th thru-hike attempt. I suppose I am average, having completed just one thru (2011) which coincides with the 20 per cent of aspiring thru-hikers who trek 2000 miles on the AT in one year. I am training like an athlete now. My goal is 40 miles/week in Dec. and Jan., then 50 mi/wk in Feb. Each week I include hike varieties to develop pace, strength and stamina. My most important gear item is my body, and it takes a commitment to prepare these older bones for sustained strenuous effort day after day, week after week, for months on the trail. Today I hiked 7 miles in 2 hrs 20 minutes on bike trails at Fort Harrison park. I push the pace on ""fast trails"" now to acclimate my sense of speed for similar AT stretches. Being fit helps me feel comfortable in the trail lifestyle. Whatever I can do now to get into good pre-condition will improve my odds of persevering. Keep on trekkin'.",,View Entry,"Dec 03, Sun",0
Hickory,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581404,"""First there is a mountain, then there is no mountain, then there is."" (Donovan).            Mountains have always fascinated and inspired people. First we see a whole mountain as a singular unit of natural occurence. Hiking on the mountain allows closer familiarity. We might notice distinct components -- not a mountain but a coincidental assortment of disaggregated parts: rocks, plants, water, soil, air, animals . . .  When we realize those parts are interdependent we can now see an entire assemblage progressing in a symbiotic system. The whole mountain only exists with necessary interactions of the components.    Hiking the mountains gets us involved in the processes of the mountain. We compact soil under our boots. We drink cook spring water, breathe fresh air, sleep serenaded by nocturnal sounds, absorb storms' energies, eat sweet berries. Walking the trail makes us part of each mountain. The mountains are in us as we are in the mountains. When we leave the trail the mountains remain indelibly within us, in our enriched physioligies and in our inspired memories.",,View Entry,"Dec 23, Sat",0

Hickory,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581876,"Training has been curtailed in this arctic air. I caught an enfeebling cold so I have limited my training efforts to just an hour or two of outdoor exposure, combining purposeful walks at a steady pace. Urban hikes take me through Ellenberger Park, Pleasant Run Golf Course and Garfield Park. I can swing in to groceries, libraries, etc. for quick warm-ups. Layered clothing is always best for regulating body heat. I see Amicalola temps dropping into teens; the waterfall must be awesome in ice. Forecasts (for average temps) there for my NOBO start 2/26 are enouraging: maybe 60's high/ 20's low. Good hiking/sleeping weather. I have reserved one bunk in a two-bunk room at Len Foote (first-time stay there for me). Here I am offering the other bunk to another thru-hiker. Seems like a good start-send-off place for the trek. I also registered on ATC's thru-hiker site. Wow! So many more aspiring thru-hikers. I will tent most nights anyway, but shelters will be jammed! Starting my hike in February puts me ahead of the swelling horde; staying ahead of the throng takes training, planning, preparation and good luck. In December I logged 143 training miles. My (adjusted) goal is now 40 miles/week with some good 15-milers a few days in late February. Guess I better get trekkin'!",,View Entry,"Jan 05, Fri",0

Hickory,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582272,"Though I realize any weather forecast for 5 weeks ahead will be based on past years' averages, the 'extended forecast' looks great for a late February launch. I fly to Atlanta Feb 26, ride MARTA to North Springs Station, meet a pre-arranged shuttle to Amicalola, and I will put my boots on Mother Earth early that afternoon. If you will need a shuttle that day, please share the ride with me. The great hosts of Top Of Georgia Hostel will meet me at 11:30 a.m. at North Springs MARTA.  So far in January I have logged 92 training miles, a little short of my goal. Still, I feel more motivated each day knowing I ""seek a greater reward"": confidently trekking the AT!   I can't wait, literally, to get in shape on the trail. My training and conditioning now will enable me to safely earn my ""trail legs"" by the time I hike to Hot Springs, about three weeks up the trail. Being in good pre-condition reduces the joint pain, muscle strain and fatigue factors of sustained, daily hiking. I will be able to sleep well! I still need a couple of gear items. Seems now that bear-proof food containers are required. I have chased bears from my campsites three times on previous hikes, so I understand. The lightest containers weigh about three pounds, so I will shake-down to reduce base weight somewhere else.  And I like the Nemo spoon-design sleeping bags since I side-sleep and belly-sleep.  A 30-degree bag should be comfortable, with my ThermoLite bag liner for 20-degree nights.  Now I need to get to a sloppy, slushy trail today for a good 10-miler.",,View Entry,"Jan 21, Sun",0

TRUE: My theories are that none of the 31 volunteer trail clubs want a reputation of having the easiest section on the AT; many more section hikers come out for a challenging weekend climb; routing options are sometimes limited to the most rugged knife's edge; and, well, we didn't come here to walk a road.
""The best of the trail is never behind you."" For NoBo hikers-I AGREE: Sometimes I feel that the Southern and Mid-Atlantic sections prepare NorthBounders for the Whites, which are spectacular, and then Maine is just outrageous. If SouthBounders can focus on the ""journey is the destination"", they will also be drawn forward to inspiring rewards. 
""Virginia is flat!"" HA! See if you agree while descending the Priest then climbing Three Ridges. Of course, you'll have your ""trail legs"" before you reach Roan Mountain, so you may feel like cruising over terrain on Mt. Rogers, etc. which would have been more challenging before you became a lean, mean hiking machine.

""It's hard to find a grumpy person on a long-distance trek."" PROBABLY TRUE: We will be among like-minded adventurers; inspired by awesome natural surrundings; enjoying a balance of solitude and social connections, releasing endorphins and feeling great! Our daily ambition is to hike in a grand linear wilderness. We are happy hikers! Then there are situational challenges when we accept the realities: ""I won't get to Katahdin today,"" and, ""No rain, no pain? No Maine!""  Just know your hike, hike your own hike, and like your hike.

Hickory,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583152,"When the journey becomes the destination we embrace the experience as the purpose of our efforts, focusing on daily discoveries, living the simple life. Eat when you're hungry, drink when thirsty, sleep when you're tired. And every day walk in a grand linear wilderness. Walk everywhere. Appreciate our neighbors and be kind to our trail families. Contribute to the community.If the journey itself is the destination, there are no Pointless-Ups-and-Downs. To hike the trail is to agree to climb the climbs, slog the bogs, cruise the flats, scramble the boulders and dance through the rocks and roots. On the trail we are only ""here"", now. If your purpose is just to finish this trail then take to the road, go climb the ""Greatest Mountain"" (Katahdin), and be done with it.But we come to this ""Continuous footpath for those who seek fellowship with the wilderness"" in order that we will live the journey.Albert Camus, French existentialist, referred to the Myth of Sysiphus as allegorical to finding meaning in an apparently meaningless existence. Upon his death Sysiphus entered purgatory where he was assigned the task of rolling a heavy stone up a steep hill. Sysiphus expected to earn his heavenly fate by setting the stone on the summit. The stone dislodged on every attempt but Sysiphus was compelled each time to try again.  Sysiphus eventually realized that this stubborn task was his eternity.Sysiphus necessarily accepted this paradoxical absurdity by embracing the effort as validation of his purpose.  On the AT, we can value each climb, bog, ford, traverse and boulder-dance as the very purpose of the journey. Keep rollin' the stone. Trek on!",,View Entry,"Feb 21, Wed",0
Hickory,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583353,"I return today to discernible rhythms of the AT. It seems the Trail can has three large geographic sections: South, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast. Social characteristics can also differ from the very busy southern and middle sections to the wilder, more remote Maine experience. Overall rhythms of terrain, treadway texture, community, flora and fauna, and resupply optionswill be enjoyed in sometimes obvious patterns or sometimes subtle details. The first 200 miles (NoBo) provide a good representation of the entire trail. Always there will be climbs, descents, smooth trail yeilding to rock-hopping, root-strewn hazardous footing. Woods roads will lead to open ridges, creekside rambles will suddenly climb to tree-covered ""balds"" (ovegrown since pioneer naming). After cruising with cattle across a pasture (don't follow the cowpath) we will re-enter the Green Tunnel. Coming from near-0's and zero's we will pass through another magic portal to the linear wilderness. Daily patterns will emerge to remind us we did not come to walk a road. Curious vernacular patterns appear as gaps in the south become notches or cols farther north. Shelters become huts, then shelters again, then leantos. Huts in the Whites are unique back-country lodges.The rhythmic variety provides a framework for the trail experience. Every climb is finite, each mucky stretch leads to ""fast trail"", when we cross a creek we will climb, there will be sunny days after our socks are soaked . . . Daily, sometimes hourly rhythms provide familiarity. To be home on the trail is to recognize, appreciate and look forward to small rewards a grand accomplishments.","Amicalola Falls

Hickory,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583464,"Len Foote Hike Inn provides a great start for the trail. I recommend the rustic and very comfortable lodge to any outdoors enrhusiast.The trails have been very clean without litter and surprisingly without discarded camp gear. Hikers are apparently better prepared for the trek. The Ridgerunners, ATC volunteers and GATC deserve our respect and gratitude. 
  I hiked through Spring in low elevations with serviceberry trees blossoming, bloodroot spikes rising through leaf litter, and wild onions popping up. Then we are back in the middle of winter on the summits. Hikers starting now get to enjoy extended springtime unfolding slowly as we head ""North With Spring"",  as Earl Shafer put it.At the Amicalola visitor center I signed in as registered thru-hiker number 372!  Registration is not required so the numbers are estimations. The Ridgerunner figured that more than 500 hikers have already started north. He expects about 4000 thru-hikers will eventually be on the AT this year.","Len Foote Hike Inn

I made a quick stop at Gooch Gap trail shelter for lunch. The place was busy with some hikers taking a ""zero"" already, and other transients like me. I got back on the soggy trail as soon as I finished lunch.When I saw a flowing spring late in the afternoon on Big Cedar I knew this would be home tonight. The tent was deftly erected, stuff brought inside out of the dripping drizzle, and water was fetched. I enjoyed lasagna (freeze-dried trail food style; just add hot water). The bagful gave me good portions of calories and protien.

Hickory,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583539,"The stream took the trail; the trail became a stream.In calculating my daily mileage I include blue-blazed (side trips off the main trail) distances. Today I hiked .4 mile to a shelter for a dry lunch break, and then the trail th to Whitley Gap was 1.2 miles.   Squishy mud prevailed over much of the treadway. Cobbly rock stretches kept boots above the muck, and roller coaster ups-and-downs hills made fun climbs. Then Blood Mountain got my circulation up with slab stairways, boulder hopping and open ledges that allow great vistas on clear days. I have had one clear day on Blood Mtn. in my five over this AT Georgia icon. I enjoyed the good climb anyway. Another hiker remarked after his trek over Blood, ""Some rock, huh?""I have now heard the three usual comments which I expect will be re-iterated as I trek on. I may have said these things myself when I was first learning the trail: A lady asked, ""Why do some hikers go so fast and so far each day? They can't be enjoying the hike.""  Another question came up, ""How do you carry enough food?"" (Yes, she really did ask that.) And, ascending Blood Mountain I heard, ""I thought we would be mountain hiking. This is mountain climbing!""I am not a speed hiker, and definitely not a trail runner. I define my pace as a cadence hiker. I try to maintain a regular rhythmic timing to my steps, as the trail allows. Probably my bicycling days contribute to keeping a constant cadence. I adjust the length of my stride according to terrain, trail surface and weather. I shorten my steps climbing steep grades, like shifting to lower gears on a ten-speed, but keep that cadence constant. A familiar song often accompanies the beat. Today I recalled most of Cat Stevens' ""In the Road to Find Out"". The beat matched my cadence. As a cadence hiker, I can cover many miles, eventually averaging 16-17 miles/day. I plan my breaks and lunch to enjoy waterfalls, vistas, wildflowers, edible plants and more. Cadence hiking gets me efficiently across relatively featureless parts and over transfer-trail, connecting through non-wilderness to re-enter another magic portal. I do enjoy much of  the trail offers. My own speed can be exhilirating when I can blast along at over 3 m.p.h.! Breakneck!","Big Cedar Mountain

We remember exceptional days; just get through ordinary days. A winter wren then called through the drizzle. A winter wren! One of my favorite wilderness birds announcing that only mediocre people can be at their best every day. I will walk in a wilderness today. This can be an exceptional day!   Standing Indian Mtn trail redembles western trails with its consistent gradient, cobble-smooth, wide treadway and regular switchbacks. Metronomic cadence to Taj Mahal's ""Queen Bee"" accompanied my steady ascent, via mental recall. After the featureless, cloud-locked summit I achieved ""trekkers' trance"": an autonomic in which the psycho-kinetic functions of cadence hiking seem to be on autopilot. The trailside becomes a blur as ordinary natural sounds provide background for my ponderances. Resuming cognizance is usually effected by changes in treadway or wildlife/wildflower sightings or ""Think water? Drink water!"" Staying hydrated is essential even on damp days.Wildlife today included three juncos playing tag ahead of me, a pileated woodpecker who laughed out loud though I did not see Woody, and a gray squurrel scurrying noisily over the leaf litter.Many ""rhodo-tunnels"" were traversed, some of which showed evidence of recent wildfires with blackened trunks and defoiliated evergreen branches. Several of the presumed dead shrubs had green shoots at the base of the trunks. I am impressed by the resilience of natural processes.Rain subsided as I approached Albert Mountain. Both significant climbs today were over 5000' elevation, but the trails were vastly different. As much as Standing Indian resembled western trails, Albert was quintessially an Appalachian Trail mountain. The last half-mile of Albert is nearly vertical! Several log and root steps alternated with open rock scrambles. Sometimes I tossed my hiking poles up ahead to free my hands to grab rock chinks or roots. The climb-to-the-sky was rewarded with vistas of nearby mountain-tops rising like islands above the cloud layer beneath me, affording a lofty, surreal exhiliration.Is Albert Mtn the steepest climb on the Appalachian Trail?

Their distant ""thump-thump-thum-thu-d-d . . ."" started the day with a smile.The trail down Wesser was generally fast with occasional rock-hopping. Lengths of treacherous treadway had developed where proper trail benching had eroded into a sideways slant with mud-slick footholds. ""Short steps are safe steps"" becomes my mantra when treadway demands caution. The descent was overall increasingly rewarding with a happy vista at the Jump-off (which I did not do) and appearance of anemone hepatica near the Nantahala gorge. Another wildflower closely resembled blue aster, though asters are known to be late bloomers, literally.In the gorge, Nantahala Outdoor Center has a lock on adventure tourism. I planned to pass right on through, then the restaunt opened as boot hit pavement. Three fish tacos later, I launched into the tediously steady hiking-climb up Cheoa Bald. The challenge of a cumulative elevation gain of 4000' feet over 8 miles is to keep the beat. ""Ain't nothing gonna break my strided"" was heard in the N.O.C. cafe, and so it was my earworm. A long hiking climb of 500'/mile can test stamina; 750'/mile elevation gain is strenuous; 1000'/mile is a near vertical power struggle. Cheoa finished steeply, though without hand-and-foot rock scrambling as on Albert. The partially bald summit affords views to the southeast, where we NoBo's have been, and a sneak pre-view to the northwest, where we are going: the Smokies!Descending Cheoa is a blast!

Sometimes we left posthole bootprints where the drifts encroached the treadway. Going was slow, but the forest was a fantastic white wonderland.Arriving mid-afternoon at my planned lunch-stop shelter, feeling fatigued as though I'd hiked a long day, this CCC building seemed like home for the night.

Short steps are safe steps.Arriving early afternoon at Double Spring Gap shelter for a planned lunch stop, I stared at the cold fireplace. Most CCC-built shelters in the Smokies have fireplaces, though park policy now discourages their use. In this extreme weather, I made a prudent decision to forego the additional miles I planned to hike, and I dug out matches. The cabin was built from twigs on the shelter floor, one match struck, and flames grew. Enough down-and-dead branches were scavanged from a nearby blow-down area to throw a little heat into the shelter. Other hikers soon drifted into home for the night, and a few scrounged their contribution to the stick-pile.

Magnificent spruce boughs bent low under the cumulative weight of ice and snow. The trek from Double Spring to Newfound Gap traverses a boreal forest biome complete with towering spruce and fir trees and alpine bogs (frozen today). Many low-arching branches gave me their snowload as I brushed under them. Overall, the scene was glorious. Sunshine appeared mid-afternoon, but the spruce thickets remained dark from the dense canopy. So the trail alternately brought me out into brilliant snowblinding light, then through shadowy coniferous tunnels. Crossing over Clingman's Dome, highest elevation on the AT, views were negligible. Having hiked fewer miles per day than my current average, I needed resupply before enjoying the eastern Smokies. As I emerged from the AT into Newfound Gap, a curious tourist inquired about my hike. He ultimately offered me a ride into Cherokee, N.C., the southern gateway town to the Smokies.

Knowing this could be a long trek today I wondered in the first mile if another energy bar should have been stuffed into my pant leg cargo pocket for the first few miles, to be eaten before first lunch. As I walked by trucks which were parked overnight near I-40, a driver greeted me with an offer of cold pizza. Trail magic!  Just as I was thinking of an extra snack, the trail provides. 
Going up Snowbird the trail was adorned with trillium, spring beauty, pussytoes and anemone wildflowers. Cumulus clouds parted and warm sun required peeling off the Marmot Precip outer shell jacket.
Views from Snowbird and Max Patch were clear and stunning with the Smokies behind NoBo's and Big Walnut and Bluff Mountains looming ahead. 
Treadway descending Snowbird is amenable to pushing the pace over smoother surface and steadily falling grade. I announced to lingering hikers on Snowbird, ""Just push in the clutch and let 'er roll!"" Picking up speed to the thrill-point legs were striding long and hiking poles were alternately reaching far forward. Trailside images were out of focus. Quartz blocks streaked by in a peripheral white blur. Rhododendron branches held out waxy leaves to slap ""high five"" on my knuckles and shoulders. One slapped my cheek. Without looking back to indentify the culprit I shouted, ""Cut it out! Not in the face!""  Rounding hairpin switchback turns, the inside hiking pole was stabbed into the sharp vertex while a few furious steps careened around the banked outer arc. Gliding soft-kneed through random leaf piles the pace was slowed when encountering root-strewn treadway. The miniature speed bumps brought the near speed-hiking to a cautious pace. I had covered two thrilling miles thanks to fast trail and amenable treadway.
Max Patch is a popular day-hiking area so crowds of happy hikers were scattered across the grassy bald even though the near gale (Ref. Beaufort Wind Scale). I held my pith helmet in place with a firm hand while traversing the windy open summit. 
Tonight I am back in the tent near Roaring Fork shelter. Only thtee hikers choose to sleep inside the shelter and three of us are tenting. The thru-hiker group along here seems to have dwindled.

Three of us tenters were in Big Agnes Fly Creeks; one late arriver was in a Z-Packs.
Mystical vapors dissipated mis-morning. Strato-cumulus layers clumped into puffballs with happy patches of blue widening.  Climbing Big Walnut early in the day was pleasant and soon the outer shell was packed. Only thr base layer shirt, long sleeves, was worn the rest of the day. 
Along with wildflowers another development in springtime is the emergence of insects. Not troublesome yet, but a logical consequence of warming weather, occasional gnats explored my sunglasses/goggles, but found no entry to circle my eyeballs. 
Smoother trail and gentler grade persisted much of the day. With fast trail and dry weather, Hot Springs was within reach. Sometimes people ask where might be a good section to sample the AT. I would recommend Max Patch to Hot Springs as one fine introduction. Had my phone camera been working, many good pictures would have posted. Perhaps other journaler here captured the scenes.
Tonight I am in Hostel at Laughing Heart in Hot Springs. The Hillbilly Market will suffice for resupply, supplementing the leftovers pilfered from Laughing Heart's hiker box.

Second course was a few toaster waffles, cranberry juice and two boiled eggs, and more coffee. A short walk took me to the Hillybilly Market for resupply.
Leaving any trail town fully laden usually means climbing out of a valley. I wondered facetiously who slipped an anvil into my pack.
Rocks returned to the trail in a hurry as the climb from Hot Springs goes right up the Lovers' Leap overlook. Nearly hand-and-foot scrambling and hitch-up rock-stepping gained elevation quickly allowing glance-back views of the town and the French Broad River. The class II and III current made interesting study of pillows, hydraulics, eddies and drops for another type of adventure.
More effort was needed to pass through the imaginary ""magic portal"" to return to the wilderness. Many day hikers had scaled Lovers' Leap on a loop trail which returned them to town. Beyond the trails' junction solitude was restored.
The trek appeared mundane until wildflowers jumped out: chickweed, tiny bluets, bloodroot, hepatica, violets, and cinquefoil added color to the otherwise di- chromatic forest of gray tree bark and brown-leaf ground. Passing a small pond my boot-steps threatened several small frogs which leapt into shallow water as I neared. Tadpoles could be seen scurrying along the bottom at pond's edge.
This stretch rolls over several humpty-bumps with climbs taking 8 or 12 or 20 minutes, then down through a gap and repeat. Inertia is my friend on steady climbs, even though some are quite steep. Maintaining momentum with sometimes only half-steps feels more efficient than stutter-stopping to catch a breath. Gear down and grind it out. ""Ain't nothing gonna break my stride . . ""
Views from Rich Mountain were hazy-blue. Wispy cirrus ""mares' tails"" clouds curl at their ends to say, ""The weather is turning.""  Stratus layers eventually thickened to an overhead gray soup.

Shelter dwellers reported blowing snow covering their sleeping bags. Inside the tent my gear and I were dry but a little cramped. As freezing rain became snow tiny avalanches would slide down the rain-proof fly, collecting in piles around the tent perimeter and effectively reducing floor space inside. Enough room remained to heat water in the vestibule for coffee and rice with plenty of raisins and sunflower seeds while packing as much as possible - all but the tent - before hustling out to quickly stash wet tent, fly and poles as snow continued to fall. Breathing on pole sections thawed them enough to separate the sections. Several inches of fresh snow had accumulated in this third winter storm on the AT'18 journey.
The trail passed through stands of drooping rhododendron and laurel through which majestic hemlocks thrust above the low canopy. Some older hemlocks tower far above the understory, standing like proud sentinels over the forest slopes. Occasionally a fallen hemlock, victim of the insidious wolly adelgid, lay decomposing, returning its earth-drawn matter to the forest floor.
Several twigs, branches and a few recent deadfall trees ignored the trail corridor and fell where they may, most noticeably across the treadway. A bit of trail service in-stride removed the smaller obstacles; short detours bypassed the unmaneuverable cross-trail trees. Snow continued to fall, sometimes sideways, indicating the storm was not yet finished with its mayhem.
Just as sensitivity was returning to my frost-nipped fingertips from the Smokies Blizzard of '18, I am again trudging through winter. Beautiful as the mountains are in deep snow, this has become discouraging. As a precaution to feeling defeated, I will take a break, catching a shuttle into Erwin, Tn. for a ""zero"", allowing winter's worst to subside.
The Appalachian Trail Conservancy considers a thru-hike to be a ""mammoth undertaking"". The overarching trail agency officially recognizes thru-hikers as those who have hiked the entire trail in 12 months or less. A ""2000-miler"" has made an honest effort to hike all the trail. Individual adjustments are then allowed for various circumstances. Though I am at heart a ""white blaze purist"", I will return to the trail beyond Devil's Fork Gap rather than wait a few more days until winter releases its grip on the 5000'+ summits in the next section. This was a serious dilemma, though I have, in three previous hikes, ""been there, done that"". So on I will go, to hike my own hike.

Such connections of existing trail allowed Myron Avery to survey and map out an ""Appalachian Trail"" implementing Benton MacKaye's vision of the ""continuous footpath"" which utilizes many established trail corridors. We hike through national and state parks and forests, local (large) nature preserves, and other protected areas. We certainly appreciate farmers and ranchers who consent to sharing their hay-fields and pastures where transfer-trail is necessary.Many near-major climbs brought me to the base of Chestnut Knob today.

My embellished nickname for this ridge is ""rock-Garden"" Mountain. The trail rolls along this rocky ridge for over five miles. Cliff-side outcroppings make enticing viewpoints. Lunch was enjoyed at such a vista. Two liters of water was carried onto rock-Garden since no reliable streams or springs would be crossed for 10 miles.Finally descending rock-Garden the rugged surface reluctantly receded allowing intermittent fast trail to prevail.

Above me cirrus clouds portended weather changes; within me I began to accept the inevitible change of scenery when I walk into Gorham for the third time. Satiety was blooming; this is enough.
Emerging from the woodland on my adventuous, off-AT route I had gained more of a White-Mtns experience by choosing an alternate trail. As I reached lower elevations, hepatica bloomed trailside, welcoming me again to a familiar woodland biome.Tonight I have a bunk and a shower in Pinkham Notch.","Lakes of the Clouds

Hickory,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592607,"Rainy weather returned as I walked into Gorham, N.H. for this third time. I have now completed three hikes along the Appalchian Trail, having hiked half the Trail in 2009 and the other half in 2010 for one complete hike; a thru-hike in 2011; and now completing a hike begun in 2013, continued in 2015, finished today. After 6600 miles walking along the Appalachian Trail, I have reached what pop culture might call a ""Forrest Gump moment"": I am satisfied; I am ready to go home.Peace; out.","Pinkham Notch
