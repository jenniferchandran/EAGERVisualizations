Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597778,"It’s almost time to return to the trail, in hopes of finally finishing it.  I’ve done 1800 miles so far, 400 left to go.  I had hoped to be able to thru hike the AT when I retired, but life gets in the way, even when you are “retired”.  Starting a second career, family events, weddings, births, all good things (fortunately)that have kept me from completing the trail as a thru hike.  I’ve found that by piecing together my hike, always picking back up where I left off, and at approximately the same time of year, I’ve been able to piece together “my own thru hike”.  I’ve missed out on some aspects of thru hike life, but I’ve also had the wonderful opportunity to meet so many more people - hikers, trail angels, and residents along the way.  And that’s the wonderful thing I’ve discovered on the AT.  The trail will always be there, and so much of the experience is about the people of the trail.",,View Entry,"Jul 20, Fri",0
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598313,"It’s a week before I begin hiking what I hope is my final 440 mile section.  You would think someone about to start hiking 440 miles of some of the most grueling terrain in North America would be busy is preparation, both physically and mentally.  They would be going over their gear, fixing, cleaning, repairing, rep, replacing.  They would be going on practice hikes with their pack, working those unused muscles and breaking in boots.  They would be taking care of things around home that need to be done in preparation for being gone for the 6 -7 weeks of the journey. You would think that.  I am not.  I am at the world’s largest gathering of aviators this week.  Oshkosh, as we call it, AirVenture as the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) calls it.  Located in Oshkosh, Wisconsin it’s the premiere event in aviation - 10,000 airplanes flying in, pilots camping under their wings, 500,000 visitors from all over the world, thousands of people in RVs, cars and bicycles converging on an airport.  Hotels are sold out for 50 miles, locals rent their homes out, college dorms are opened up, campgrounds are busting at the seams.  All for 7 days of air shows, warbird demonstrations, educational forums, aircraft displays, equipment and software demonstrations, and celebrity events.  You rub elbows with astronauts and World War II veterans, you meet authors and listen to experts in aircraft safety, you walk around endlessly looking at thousands of vendors hawking their wares and their bright shiny airplanes.  It has everything, and there is nothing like it.  Oshkosh.  For I am a pilot, and a pilot yearns to be at Oshkosh.  Surrounded by aviation and aviators, surrounded by the sounds of warbirds taking off at 6 am, surrounded by the sight of aging veterans and little children walking up to an airplane to touch a piece of history, to be surrounded by fellow aviators who have touched the skies and know the freedom and the beauty of flight.  And when the week ends, friends depart with a solemn promise, “51 weeks brother, 51 weeks”.  I’ll be there, and hopefully with a certificate that says I walked 2000 + miles.  A certificate that says I experienced one of the grandest trails of the world, one step at a time.  A certificate that says I walked until my feet were sore and blistered, that I got soaked and sunburnt and taken in by strangers.  A certificate that means so much that you give up your family and friends for 6 months, and that you made new friends that are your new family.  For that is the magic of the trail.",,View Entry,"Jul 26, Thu",0
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599177,"My last preparation entry apparently foreshadowed my next entry, because I developed tendinitis in my left ankle just as I was planning to leave Oshkosh.  I didn’t do anything to it, I didn’t walk excessively, it just started to get sore and stiff.I flew back home with my friend Bart last Sunday the 29th,.  We had a great flight, departed Oshkosh with no delays, climbed to 7500’ and flew over Lake Michigan.  We flew direct Port Huron, got some fuel  and took off and picked up our IFR clearance as clouds and storms were developing.  I was flying this leg which took us over Ontario to Niagra Falls, and then direct to Albany, NY.    As I was flying my ankle was just an annoying soreness, but I was concerned it was going to really delay me getting back on the trail.After landing in Albany, I struggled to get out of the plane.  Three and a half hours of flying had me cramped up.  My ankle was swelling and I was hobbling.  After refueling and a bathroom break, we hoped back in the plane for the final leg to Chatham, MA.  Once again we passed over the Appalachian Trail and I was wondering if I was going to be meeting up with some of those hikers in the coming weeks.  Boston Air traffic was as busy as the highways below us on a Sunday afternoon  and we were thankful for ATC watching over us.  Arriving Cape Cod was beautiful and seeing the Cape spread out before us in one easy view was magnificent.  We landed Chatham and I limped my way out of the plane again, pulling all my gear out of Bart’s plane so he could depart quickly for his final leg back to New Hampshire.My wife was supposed to meet us and bring Bart a lobster roll, but she was no where in sight.  I had called from Albany and had not received a response.  I called  again, and texted, and called, and texted, and called. 6 calls in all, no response.  Bart needed to get going to get in before dark so he took off sans lobster roll and I waited another hour.  Getting really concerned I decided I had better Uber home.  Should I start calling hospitals, police?  Best to get home and see the situation.  I called my son and asked if he had any contact.  He tracked her phone and said it was at home.  More mystery.Twenty minutes later, I arrived home and the car was in the driveway, undamaged.  I hobbled inside, and no one was there.  Kidnapped I thought?  Her phone was sitting on table charging.  No sign of disturbance.  I checked the backyard, nothing.  And no dog.  Maybe she was searching for the dog.  The dog never runs away.  Finally I heard a noise and she comes walking in with the dog, Abby.  “Oh you’re home early. ”  You can figure out the rest of the discussion.  Two days later the ankle is not improving and I’m at the clinic.  Diagnosis is tendinitis and the doc gives me some prednisone.  He’s not hopeful when I tell him I’m trying to get back on the AT.  He gives me that look, that look that says you are crazy to even think about it.  He gives me the rehab instructions, the prescription, the admonition that it could flare up any time, and has the nurse wrap my ankle with an ace bandage, all the while knowing that this will likely not end well.He’s probably right, the ankle is feeling better, a touch of soreness today, and I’m packing my gear for a return to the trail.  We shall see, we shall see.",,View Entry,"Aug 03, Fri",0
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599454,"It was time to leave.  If I was going to have a chance of making it to Katahdin I needed to get back to the trail.  Unfortunately I had boxed myself in once again and had a hard stop of September 10 to be able to get back in time to do a Rusty Pilot seminar in Kentucky on September 15 and get back to Kansas to start teaching Private Pilot Ground School  on Sept 24.  So this was it.
I felt like my tendinitis was not going to flare up and I had gotten all the prep work done at the cottage.  My wife dropped me off at the bus stop, we said our goodbyes, and it was off on a bus to Boston and then on to Hanover, NH.   As I was on the bus I continued looking at the maps and evaluating my timing.  I had planned on repeating the 40 miles from Hanover to Warren, NH as a warm up for the White Mountains.  The more I looked at it I decided that I needed to skip those  miles and restart where I left off last year.  I called one of the hiker shuttles in the AT guide and fortunately he had availability to shuttle.  $85, but it would save me three days.
I met Stray Cat at the bus stop in Lebanon.  He has a car service now, shuttling hikers and business people to the airport, and probably some prom queens.   Getting picked up in a Lincoln Town Car is pretty luxurious.  Stray Cat had hiked the trail in two big sections, 1996 and 2006 so he had an affinity for hikers.  We talked about the trail and how we got here, and a short hour later he was dropping me off where I had gotten off last year, too weak to go on from giardia.
It was 5 pm and I had 5 miles to go to get to Hikers Welcome Hostel where I had stayed last year.  It felt good to be back, the forest felt fresh and friendly, the trail covered in pine needles.  And then after 50 feet or so I was reminded how out of shape I am for this undertaking.  It was a gradual ascent up but up nevertheless and my legs and lungs were complaining.  The climb took me up Mt. Mist, which was only 600 feet of elevation gain, but enough to remind me what a bad idea it is to enter the Whites with rusty trail legs.  The descent down was pleasant and overall I was pleased to have down the first 5 miles in 2.5 hours.  It was a pretty easy reintroduction.
Arriving at the hostel I was pleased to see a familiar face, Bag-O-Tricks was there holding court with the younger hikers.  Tricks had hiked the trail many years ago and was one of those former hikers that can’t stay away.  He was at Hikers Welcome last year and took care of me when I had to get off with Giardia.  “Tricks!” I yelled. It startled him to see me but then it was like a high school reunion.  He gave me a ride down to the Roadside Cafe so I could get some dinner and we caught up with life.  Later that night at the hostel we and other hikers were sitting around swapping stories and giving advice.  He easily convinced me to slackpack Mt. Moosilauke the next day and loaned me a daypack.  I had never slackpacked before but this was a good time to do it.  Mt. Moosilauke was a 4800 foot mountain with very steep approaches.  Even thru hikers coming all the way from Georgia appreciated the opportunity to slack pack it. Tomorrow would be my real start, getting back into the big mountains.","NH 25C

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599554,"I woke up early and used the quiet of the morning to start catching up on some journaling and editing pictures.  Staying at the hostel had been a good re-entry to trail life - being around hikers and getting to hear about what lies ahead in the semi comfort of a bunkhouse and being able to take a shower.  
I had signed up to slackpack Mt. Moosilauke from the hostel which is a service they highly recommend and profit from.  For $15 they give you a ride to Kinsman Notch on the north side of the mountain and let you hike back south to the hostel.  Mt. Moosilauke is 4802 feet high and you start from an elevation of about 1800 feet the notch.  3000 feet of elevation gain in 3.8 miles is a tough climb when you are just getting back on the trail!  
At 7:30 am three of us piled into the van and Brooklyn, the caretaker, gave us a ride.   Orion and Gazelle had slackpacked the day before and were headed north, so I was the only slacker this trip.  Arriving at the Notch there were quite a few hikers already in the parking lot.  A woman named Stitches was doing trail magic and so I grabbed an apple. Orion, Gazelle and I said our goodbyes and I took off down the trail.  Once again the forest felt good and there were numerous streams flowing through the Notch.  The trail immediately started UP and I started to get a taste of the next 3 hours of climbing.   The trail paralleled a waterfall and was very steep.  Hiking poles were pretty useless as you were scrambling up rocks and pulling yourself up.  The trail maintainers had installed a number of wood blocks into the steeper rock faces to make steps which was really helpful.   In some places they had even installed rebar handholds to assist in the climb.
The setting was beautiful with the music of the waterfall and the green of the pines and firs surrounding the banks of the waterfall.  The trail kept climbing up and up until I finally got to the Beaver Brook shelter where I stopped for a rest and some food.  Three SOBOs were there, Hasherator, Slow Ride and Ghost.  We exchanged stories, tanked up with water and food, and then all took off up the mountain.  Slow Ride and Ghost were both slackpacking too but Hasherator had his full pack.   The trail “leveled out” for the final 900 feet to the summit and it was once again possible to use poles.  
The summit was a wide open bald where the fir trees stopped suddenly and just tundra grasses survived. As I approached the summit I could see lots of people up there already which surprised me since we hadn’t seen too many hikers on the AT.  There were numerous trails converging on the summit and so it was a popular place with day hikers.  The view from the summit was breathtaking though there was a lot of haze that prevented good clear views and pictures.  It was warm and sunny with just a light breeze and there were 30 some hikers enjoying the summit.  
I hung out too long enjoying the scene, and about 2 pm finally started heading down.  There was still a 5.7 mile and 3800 foot descent to get back to the hostel.  It proved to be a long, tough on the knees descent down the mountain.  The trouble with the Whites is they haven’t discovered switchbacks yet, so the trails pretty much go straight up and down the mountainside.  I did make an additional detour up to the south summit, which the sign said was only 1/10 if a mile but felt like a lot more.  The south summit was mostly treed with a small rocky top, but had good views of Moosilauke north summit.  
After a long hike down I met up with a couple of women hikers who were sectioning, Google and JC, and we three met up with Hasherator.  As we we were hiking down and talking, it turned out that Google and Hasherator lived nearby each other in Florida and both had vacation properties near each other in Tennessee.  We met Google’s husband who was waiting near the bottom and it turned out he was a Rusty Pilot.  So we talked airplanes the rest of the way down the mountain.  Coincidences!!
It had been a long day made longer with numerous rest breaks.  It felt really good to return to the hostel and be able to take a shower again.  Overall a good decision to slackpack Mt. Moosilauke.","Kinsman Notch
",Hikers Welcome Hostel,"Aug 06, Mon",8.90
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599877,"I checked out of Hikers Welcome hostel and said goodbye to Hashenator and Slow Ride.  They’re heading south, I’m heading north.  Bisquick, the other caretaker, gave Old Scout and me a ride to Kinsman Notch.  Another hiker, Papa, was signed up but had rolled his ankle on Cube Mountain down south and wasn’t going to be hiking for a while.  Papa was like me, trying to complete his AT hike this year after 4 years and was on his final leg as well.  It’s kind of amazing that we hadn’t run into each other before.
Old Scout was slackpacking Moosilauke like I had done the day before and I would be heading north solo.  We were dropped off at Kinsman Notch said our “good lucks” and headed in our respective directions.  The trail immediately went up steeply, climbing up to a ridge that would eventually lead to Mt. Wolf.  It was a hazy day and humid, but a comfortable temperature.  
The trail was unremarkable, lots of ups and downs, and rocks and roots, ... and mud.  There were very few breaks in the pines for views and I just kept winding up and down.  The most remarkable thing was that I was alone, no one passed me in either direction for hours.  The crowds must be thinning out this far north I thought.  Eventually Spam town passed me and then I passed him while he was resting.  I hiked down to a small stream and really needed a lunch break badly.  I was exhausted and needed a rest.  I stopped for almost an hour and only saw Spam town and one other pair of southbound (SOBOs) hikers.  I then had to climb Mt. Wolf which was only about an 800 foot climb, but was just exhausting me with the rocks and roots.  Two other hikers passed me, but it was still amazing how few were out here.  Thunder started in the distance and clouds started growing darker as I climbed.  I made it to the summit but it was in the trees and I didn’t bother to take the side trail to the viewpoint as the thunder was growing closer.  I headed down Mt. Wolf and was still slowed with the rocks and roots and mud.  The mud was pervasive, sometimes impassable so you just had to trek through it.  I finally made it down to a trail junction that was a mile to the next shelter when it started to rain in earnest.  A couple more SOBOs passed me going up the mountain and I told them about a possible stealth camping site that they might be able to use to escape the rain.
I got to the Eliza Brook shelter about 4:30 and Crush was there and another hiker Stealth.  I had met Crush at the hostel, but hadn’t met Stealth before.  I thought it would just be the three of us until Silverback showed up, and then another hiker, and another, and another.  Soon the shelter was full and other hikers started pitching tents and hammocks, firing up their stoves, and it was a big old reunion.  There were some 20 hikers total, all NOBO thru-hikers.  I was the only “old guy” which was unusual and Silverback was the only female, which was more unusual.  From my previous experience the women were an increasing percentage the farther north you go.  Most of the guys were lateish 20 somethings.  There were grand conversations of how many miles each had done, experiences in the last trail town, the weird versions of Ramen they’ve created, and always...how many miles left to Katahdin.  I did find it fun how they treated the conditions of the trail that I had been suffering through.  The rocks, the roots, the mud were all just a fun challenge.  They all had their own advice to the group - “You just have to commit” “You just have to plant your landing” “You’re gonna get mudded so you just need to go for it”.
I fell asleep while the “party” was still going strong.  After expecting a quiet night in the shelter, the party was a fun gathering to listen to and I found the crowds were not thinning out.","Kinsman Notch
",Eliza Brooks Shelter,"Aug 07, Tue",7.50
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599878,"It was dark when I woke up in the shelter, everyone was quiet, which is unusual for a shelter.  Then it started, Stealth started snoring.  I tossed and turned for a while in my sleeping bag and finally fell asleep again.  I woke up again as the first of the other hikers were stirring, and quite quickly everyone was up and packing, eating breakfast, and making plans for the day.  Eventually it was decided that the 20 somethings would hitch into town and hit the brewery in Woodstock. Oh to be 20 again!
I was packed and got my water from the stream and started climbing the next mountain by 7 am.  The trail followed the stream which quickly turned into a waterfall coming down the mountainside.  After climbing 1000 feet the trail followed the stream to Harrington Pond which looked like an ideal place to spot a moose.   From the pond the trail followed a brook, literally the trail was in the brook, until is started veering up the steep mountainside once again.  I was now in for serious climbing.  The trail followed a series of washes that required hand over hand climbing up steep rock faces.  This was not hiking anymore so I stowed my poles and climbed.  This went on for another 1000 feet until reaching a ridge that led to the summit of South Kinsman at  4358 feet.  The actual summit of Kinsman was covered with stunted fir trees, but there were a few outcroppings with views.  It had clouded over by now and was hazy, but you had a nice view of the Presidentials though many of their tops were in the clouds.  After lingering too long at South Kinsman I hiked a mile down a saddle and back up to North Kinsman at 4293 feet.  
At North Kinsman my day fell apart, I was able to get cell service and got an email from a colleague at the junior college where I teach pilots ground school.  They had completed the flyer advertising my ground school and so I spent an hour or so dashing off emails to my flight school and friends asking them to post and distribute the flyer.  I went from AT hiker to flight instructor and it was hard to turn off the excitement.
Before leaving the summit I met a SOBO from Scotland who was enamored with the AT.  De Juer was having a great time and marveled at the openness.  I finally headed down Kinsman and stopped at Kinsman Pond shelter for lunch.  Time was my enemy, I had spent too much time up top and I still had 7 slow treacherous miles (with a 2300 foot descent and a 2500 foot ascent) to get to the next campsite.  One option was Lonesome Lake Hut, and the possibility of work for stay.  It was only two miles down the mountain.   I did my best to “hustle” down, but it was slow going.  Once again steep pitched rock faces that required two hands and two feet to maneuver down.  I made it to the Hut at 4 pm and asked about work for stay and they said I was in!
The AMC huts are incredible, they are self contained huts housing visitors that are “off the grid”.  What little power they need is provided by solar, hydro electric or wind.  They compost all their waste, and no connection to the “outside world” other than the trail.  Lonesome Lake is the easiest to get to as it’s only 1.9 miles from the parking lot.  Guests hike in, but get to stay in bunkhouses and get served luxury meals in a lodge setting.  If thru hikers are lucky, they can get a few limited spots on a work for stay basis.  You get to eat any leftovers after the guests have eaten and can sleep on the floor of the common area after they’ve gone to bed.  This worked out fantastic for me as I wouldn’t have made it 5 more miles until after dark, and I got to eat pulled pork, salad, homemade bread, and brownies!
And more than the food, it was a chance to experience another facet of AT life that I have read about so many times.  Sitting down at the Lake while the families ate and laughed, watching the clouds come down over the Franconia Ridge made for a very satisfying evening.","Eliza Brooks Shelter
",Lonesome Lake Hut,"Aug 08, Wed",6.10
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599978,"I woke up about 5 am in the Lonesome Lake common area after a tough night trying to sleep.  The common area had a couple of bright red “Exit” signs that shined down and I kept trying to reposition my sleeping bag to avoid them.  I got up and repacked while the cook started to prepare breakfast.  I could have just taken off down the trail and eaten my own food, but fresh coffee cake, peaches, and sausage were worth waiting for.   The same drill as last night, I had to wait until the guests ate and everything was cleaned up before I could join the Croo to eat.
I finally left Lonesome Lake at 8:30 and headed down the mountain.  Crossing I-93 the trail immediately heads up the next mountain to Liberty Springs.  I hoped to get further than that camp, but the next shelter was another 7.6 miles.  I was pleasantly surprised that the trail was steep, but not as steep as Moosilauke or Kinsman, and there was no rock climbing.  It was rocky, but “normal” rocky and not “oh my God I have to climb this” rocky.   The trail was unremarkable, just a constant up for 2500 feet.   
I arrived about 2pm and was feeling good.  I got some water and had lunch and talked to the caretaker and a couple of other hikers.  The next 7 miles were relatively easy, along a high ridge and took in Mts. Lincoln, Lafayette, and Garfield.  Everything was pretty easy until Garfield they said.  I decided to give it a go and took off knowing I’d be finishing in the dark.  After hiking up about 300 vertical feet, I stopped and thought about it some more.  Pulled out my map, studied it some more. Looked at the time, calculated some more.  My flight instructor instinct kicked in and I started looking at the risk management side.  I’d be “flying” (hiking) into an unknown “airfield” (shelter site), in the dark, with an outdated weather forecast, over mountainous terrain.   Would I make that flight?  Definitely not!
And then I turned around and headed back down the mountain to the Liberty Springs campsite.  While I was disappointed in myself to have such a short mileage day, I’d be more disappointed to be coming down Mt. Garfield in the dark and never having had any experience on that mountain.
I set up my tent on a platform at the campsite and talked with the caretaker, True Grits.   He was describing how beautiful the hike along the ridge was and how the forecast for tomorrow was to be beautiful.  
I had an afternoon to kill, but it was nice to be in such a gorgeous setting amongst the pines with nothing to do and not be exhausted.  I laid in my tent and pulled out my Flight Training magazine that I had been packing and got to read it cover to cover. 
Around 6 pm the campsite was starting to fill up and Snow Angel (from The Netherlands) came in and pitched her tent on the platform I was on.  I had met her at Hikers Welcome so it was good to see her again.
I made dinner on the platform and watched the sunset fade into the clouds in the West.  Tomorrow should be a good day.","Lonesome Lake Hut

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600724,"It was a relatively short climb up the 400 feet to the Franconia Ridge from Liberty Springs.  Once on the ridge a left turn took us along a tree lined ridge that headed due north for Little Haystack Mountain (4780’), the first of the 4000 foot mountains we’d be climbing today.  The weather was perfect for hiking, cool and sunny with light winds from the northwest.  Hiking along the ridge you could get small glimpses through the pines of the valley below on either side.  The gentle ups and downs of the ridge were a pleasure compared to the constant ups of the last days.  As we approached Little Haystack we could see the climb to the summit would have some steep pitches to climb, but only for 600 - 700 feet. 
As I climbed Little Haystack there was a rock formation that rose above the trees and I finally had a full view of the ridge that we had been climbing, as well as Mt. Liberty and all the mountains and valleys to the south as far as the eye can see.  It was an amazing view, but just a small glimpse of what was to come.   Clouds were floating through the valley with the bases were just above Little Haystack.  The climb continued up to the summit of Little Haystack where I could see a lot of day hikers coming up a different trail.  Arriving at the summit provided spectacular 360 degree views of the Franconia Ridge.  Clouds floated in and out through the valleys and over the mountains, creating an ever changing view.  The wind was picking up and I had to hold on to my hat for fear of it going over the ridge.
After a small snack I headed for the next peak, Mt. Lincoln.  It’s only 0.7 miles to Lincoln, and the trail is above tree line the whole time so there are incredible views from the ridge.  There are hundreds of day hikers out on this fine day, as well as dozens of thru hikers both NOBO and SOBO.  As thru hikers meet we question each other about what lies ahead and share tips of where to stay and best places to eat.  At Mt. Lincoln (5089’) I ate a little more while enjoying the view, taking pictures, and sharing notes with a couple of SOBOs, Madison and Chris.  Mt. Lafayette had been  obscured in the clouds when I arrived, but as we chatted, clouds drifting by with the wind, the summit of Lafayette  became visible.  It was only another mile to the summit of Lafayette and so I continued along the ridge line to Lafayette.  The trail was fantastic with  a few rock formations to climb or descend but another easy ascent to the summit of Lafayette (5250’).  
Lafayette is the highest peak on the Franconia and the cloud bases had continued to lift so that Mt. Washington in the distance was visible, as well as the Kinsmans and Lonesome Lake Hut across the valley to the west.  To add to my fascination, a glider was  silently soaring back and forth through the valley, gaining altitude with the updrafts and eventually rising above the elevation of the mountains.  After watching that performance, I knew I had to get my glider rating.
The trail splits at Lafayette and 95% of the hikers head back down to some parking lot in the valley, and the AT continued on to Mt. Garfield.  From Lafayette, Garfield could be clearly viewed, and the trail was reportedly treacherous.  Descending down Lafayette was equally treacherous with lots of rock climbs and descents.   This is the point I probably would have been last night if I had continued on and it would have been getting dark.   I was doubly glad of my decision to stay at Liberty Springs.  There was no place to stealth camp, and the trail was rocky and difficult.   The ascent up Garfield was very difficult with numerous rock climbs and some very steep pitches.  
The summit of Garfield was unimpressive, it was very small with an old concrete foundation.  It had good views of the Franconia Ridge, but in the late afternoon I was looking almost directly in the sun.   Garfield camp was just 0.3 miles down, but it was a steep down.   When I got to the side trail to the camp it announced another 0.2 to the campsite.  Arriving at the shelter it was nice to see a smiling face, True Grits, the caretaker from Liberty Springs had rotated over to Garfield for a few days.
After I set up my tent in a platform I was talking to my platform “neighbors”.  Antwon and Emily were from Quebec City hiking the 4000 footers, Eric and Justin were from Providence weekend hiking, Murph and Taylor were NOBOs, Late Start was a NOBO LASHer (Long Ass Section Hiker) who had also come over from Liberty Springs. Bearskin was SOBO on his second thru hike.  We were all chatting when Eric and Justin pulled out a bottle of wine (a real bottle!) and a bunch of Red Solo cups and gave us all a dash of wine.  Wine never tasted so good!!  A great finish for the evening after a day on the Franconia.","Liberty Springs Campsite
",Garfield Campsite ,"Aug 10, Fri",7.50
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600756,"Somewhere between the summit of Lafayette and Garfield camp I pulled or strained a muscle or muscles  in my left leg.  I’m not sure exactly what, but I was feeling like it was a hamstring which was really sore last night and this morning.  I also had some definite tightness and weakness in my knee.  I hobbled around camp eating breakfast and packing up, knowing this was going to be a tough day with the injury.  Antwon and Emily packed up and left on their next leg of their 3 day 4000 footer peak bagging adventure while I was packing.  I was next to leave hobbling down the trail favoring my sore left leg.
The first obstacle going down was The Waterfall.   True Grits had mentioned it, but I thought he meant the trail paralleled a waterfall.  What he meant was the trail went DOWN the waterfall.  It was very steep and meant climbing down using both hands and feet.  Fortunately the stream that was going through the waterfall was at a low flow so I wasn’t getting doused.  As I got close to the bottom, Murph and Taylor were coming down and I got some good pictures of them descending.  The Waterfall went down a couple hundred feet and then the trail diverged from the stream bed to descend steeply another 300 feet to a saddle.  From the saddle were great views of the valley below, and of the next climb up South Twin Mountain.
Galehead Hut sits a short way up South Twin Mountain and it was a great place to stop for lunch.   It was a nice day out and so there were lots of day hikers at the hut.  There was also a multitude of trail runners running the trails.  They would come up silently behind you and go flying by as I’m trudging up or down with a heavy pack.  The are dressed in running shorts and a little vest with a couple of small water bottles.  They have about 2% body fat and are truly impressive as they easily bounce from rock to rock as they ascend or descend the trail. 
After leaving Galehead Hut the trail ascends straight up South Twin Mountain (4902’) for 1200 feet.  At the top, there are once again great views from its rocky summit of the Franconia Ridge to the west and Mt. Washington and the Presidentials to the east.  The skies had clouded over by now and it appeared like rain was coming.  With my sore left leg I was going to make it a short day and decided to only go 2 more miles to Guyot Shelter.  A rocky descent down Twin Mountain led to a fairly level trail around Guyot Mountain and up a treeless Guyot Spur (4570’).  Guyot Spur is above treeline and  once again I had wonderful views of the Franconia Ridge.  Unfortunately the shelter was 0.8 miles off the AT and down Guyot Spur several hundred feet on the Bondcliff Trail.  
When I arrived the camp was very crowded, with 4 tents on each platform.  The camp area is on a hillside and numerous wooden platforms have been built to provide level areas to set up tents.  I got the last little space on a platform and was sharing it  with two other families.   One couple, Richard and Heidi, are about to complete the last of Heidi’s 48 4000 footers. They are carrying wine, champagne, and luxury chocolates to celebrate the milestone.
The cook area in the camp (an area with rocks and bear boxes underneath a tarp) is packed with hikers and I decided on just doing a cold dinner to conserve time and energy.  Hikers kept coming in and the caretaker put them where he could.  In the end, 87 hikers overnight in Guyot Shelter camp.  The Shelter is full and a raging party was going on with music playing and a strobe light flashing until late at night.  Very unusual for most back country camps where hiker midnight is as soon as it gets dark; but then most of these campers were weekenders.  The caretaker kind of lost control on this one.  One bonus however was that Richard and Heidi shared some of their wine and a homemade brownie with me and so I was able to enjoy a nice Sauvignon Blanc while talking with the other hikers.  Good Luck to Heidi tomorrow!
After dinner and conversation, I hobbled back up to my tent platform and crawled into my tent.  Another short day but I was able to move forward little by little and get over a couple more 4000 footers on my march to the Presidentials.","Garfield Campsite

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600757,"It started raining about 3 am and kept going until about 7.   When I opened my tent Guyot campsite was a wet and wispy place with layers of fog hanging in the hillsides.  I went down to the spring and filled my water bottles and grabbed my food bag.  There were a few people in the “kitchen area”, but for the most part people were slow to rise.  I packed pretty quickly and said good bye to my platform family.  Richard and Heidi were packing up for their ascent of her last two 4000 footers and had champagne ready to be popped.
I climbed back up the mountain 0.8 miles to rejoin the Appalachian Trail, passing back over Guyot Spur (4570’).  It was a vastly different place being in the clouds now.   Visibility was a couple hundred feet and it was misting.  A couple of French Canadians were behind me and asked me for directions to  Twin Mountain.  With visibility so bad it was difficult to tell which direction the trail was headed while you were on the rocky slopes of Guyot.  I rejoined the AT and went over Mount Guyot (4580’) which was wetter and windier than the Spur.  Someone had stealth camped on the summit but were still nestled in their tent as I passed.  (Stealth camping above tree line is against the rules in the Whites, but people still do it risking stiff fines.)
Over the summit and I was back in the  dwarf Spruce trees and made my way down the mountain.  The trail was rocky, but not too bad.  The trail would be descending toward Zealand Mountain (4260’).   Zealand summit is 0.1 off the AT so I took the short blue blazed trail over to its summit just to get another 4000 footer.  The trail got better after Zealand with the exception of some steep cliffs where they had erected a wooden ladder.  I arrived Zealand Hut about noon and feasted on lemonade and coffee cake at the Hut.  The trails were relatively quiet today with the rain and I hardly saw any other thru hikers.  A few day hikers were out, which was is stark contrast to the day before where the trails were packed with the good weather.  Still, a few braved the rain.  
Leaving Zealand Hut there was a fantastic stretch of level trail that went for several miles. I’m guessing it was an old road bed at one time.  What a joy to be cruising on level trail!   There was even a section through a rock fall along a mountainside that they filled in with dirt to form a level trail instead of having to hop from rock to rock.
There were probably some beautiful views on this descent but the clouds remained low, the mist wound through the valleys, and rain continued as a light mist.  I was soaked all the way through and I was started to raise a few blisters in my wet socks.  It would have been pointless to change them as the dry ones would quickly become the wet ones.
As I was coming down the final hill to the highway, a SOBO, a very drunk SOBO, was coming up the hill saying, “There’s Trail Magic down at the road, EPIC trail magic, and they’ve got beeeer.”  He staggered on up the hill and I started hustling down.  I could smell, or at least imagined I was selling hamburgers grilling all the way down the hill.  I got to the parking lot and there was no imagining going on, a canopy was set up and several hikers sitting in chairs feasting on burgers and hot dogs.  
Jeff and Amy thru hiked in 2017 and had been wanting to do trail magic to “give back” to the trail.  They set up their canopy and chairs and had burgers and dogs grilling, an assortment of drinks, veggies, chips, and other snacks, as well as resupply items like TP and Advil (Vitamin I).  It was an amazing spread, and we felt like kings and queens.  Late Start was there as well as a bunch of other hikers I hadn’t met - Bagel, Short Sticks, Ramble, Strawberry, Stretch and a few others I didn’t catch their names.  Amy started describing their hike and how she had broken her wrist a mile short of the Maine line.  She knew she had to finish the Trail so she got transported to Bangor, got it set, got a cast on and she and Jeff continued on to Katahdin.  Her summit picture has her hand raised with a cast on.
Amy was so pleased she had done a hugely successful trail magic event, she pulled out a bottle of champagne and Strawberry popped the cork and we passed it around.  Then another bottle of champagne came out that Late Start popped, and and another bottle got passed around.  Pictures were taken, new friends were made, and the magic of the trail shone through.","Guyot Campsite

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600758,"Waking up in a hotel room was pure luxury.   My gear had a chance to dry, I was just a few steps away from a toilet that flushes, I was clean for the first time in a week.  After trail magic Jeff and Amy had given Late Start and I a ride to the AMC hostel, which turned out being full up.  Late Start and I then got a hitch from a wonderful couple who were out for their 50th anniversary dinner and we got into a local hotel instead.
I had planned to get going early and do my laundry, but laying underneath the sheets just felt too good.  I finally got out of the bed around 7 gathered my dirty clothes and headed across the road to the Mt. Washington Resort where I had been told they had a guest laundry.  The Mt. Washington is a palace surrounded by a golf course surrounded by the mountains. It’s magnificent.  (I’m sure a night there would be equivalent to my monthly budget for the AT hike.)
I found the laundry, called home while the clothes washed and ate a $5 croissant from the coffee shop. When I got back to the room Late Start was packing and sorting her stuff.   I needed to resupply my food so I headed down the road for the Irving gas station.  I was able to get enough to suffice there and headed back to the room to pack up.  One final item before we left civilization was to call about my bent hiking pole.  Three cheers to Leki customer service!   I was able to talk to a real person immediately and they instantly said they would send a replacement pole to the next town I’ll be at.
We checked out of the hotel and saw a few trucks stopped at the nearby rest stop.  Late Start just walked up to one of them and asked if they wouldn’t mind giving us a ride back to the trail.  “Sure!  No problem at all!”   I’ll even take you by the ice cream place if you want an ice cream before you get back on.”  Great people out here!   Well the ice cream place was closed much to our disappointment, but we got a ride back to the Trail Magic parking lot we left yesterday.
Late Start and I started up Webster Cliff Trail which immediately started up the mountain.  I stopped for water and Late Start got ahead of me and the was the last I saw of her.  There were actually a few switchbacks down low but soon the trail was going straight up the mountainside.  It started to rain and In numerous places the trail was just a rock climb making it treacherous once again.  Fortunately the rain ended fairly quickly but the rocks remained wet.  After about a mile I had climbed 1600 feet to the Webster Cliffs overlook, and the views were well, clouds.  Everything from the overlook was white.  The trail then continued up more cliffs and more ledges, and more cliffs and more ledges, and yet more cliffs and more ledges.  I was climbing higher and higher into the clouds.  Every time I got to a ledge and thought this was the top, it proved to lead to another.  The climb continued up for a 1000 feet finally reaching the summit of Mt. Webster.  I had not been prepared for this type of afternoon.
I had 3.1 miles to go to the tent site and about 2 hours of light left.  There was a good stealth site at the top of Webster and I had a fair amount of ups and downs, and I had to get over Mt. Jackson first.  I weighed my options and decided that getting to the tent site should be the priority, even with a small amount of night hiking.  The real driver was Mizpah Hut which next to the tent site.  The weather was forecast to get worse tomorrow and having the security of the Hut would be a big factor as opposed to stealth camping on top of a mountain.
I continued on through ups and downs , rock climbs and descents, bogs and forest.  Climbing Mt. Jackson (4052’) was another 100 foot rock climb.  Finally it was mostly downhill to the tent site.  It was getting dark now so I turned on my headlamp what found with the heavy mist in the air I was looking through a shroud of white.  
I finally arrived at the tent site and my visibility through the mist was just a few feet.  I searched around trying to find a platform that was open and finally found one marked “Overflow”, the platform of last resort.  I set up my tent and got everything put away and pulled out a ham sandwich that I had got during my resupply, a bag of Fritos and a bottle of wine from Amy and Jeff’s Trail Magic.  It was the best backcountry meal I could ask for.  
After dinner I climbed into my sleeping bag exhausted.  It was a Nero Day (next to Zero) that ended up being a very long day of climbing into the clouds.  Shortly after nestling into my sleeping bag it started to rain in earnest, and I was glad to have made it to the tent site.","Rt 302
