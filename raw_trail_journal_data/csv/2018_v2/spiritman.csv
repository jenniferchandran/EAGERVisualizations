Cannot thank High Loon and Nancy for their generous hospitality.   Entered “the Smokies” and Mother Nature brought winter back with rain, sleet, wind, and snow.  It was hard, breathtakingly beautiful, and nerve wrecking for my Linda as cell service was sketchy and sometimes it was 24 hours without me being able to let family know I was ok. The snow came!  Multiple falls but the deep snow is cushy... sore but no injuries.  Made it to Newfound Gap and into Gatlinburg.  Everything in my pack is frozen, my tent is crusted with ice ... what an adventure!!

Rogers - Virginia’s tallest mountain.  The rains came and it turned cold!!!  No snow but easily could have.  Saw some “ponies” (they are really small horses) in the Grayson Highlands that surround Mt. Rogers.  After trudging through upwards of 3” of rain, a handful of slips and falls, and some 17 mile days I decided to “zero” in Marion.  Oh the joy of town food and hot showers!!!  Heading out tomorrow into a day of rain BUT rising temperatures.  AT hikers can handle rain and we can deal with cold ... but together they spell trouble and major discomfort.  Two milestones to put a shoutout on:  just passed the 500 mile mark and this week will hit the 1/4 way point!!!!!  Thank you family, God, all!","

There is much conversation on the trail about the lingering winter and hopes for spring.  There is a noticeable uptick in buds on trees and I’ve seen more chipmunks, squirrels, and deer.  I’ve also noticed more birds are singing in the mornings.  
Southern Virginia is pretty.  Some AT guidebooks sometimes say “Virginia is flat” ... nonsense!  There are tough climbs here. 
For those who might be looking for long distance hiking tips I can confirm the life expectancy of hiking boots.  The rule of thumb is 500 miles max for trail runners and boots.  My Lowa Renegades have been wonderful but they are done.  A trail saying  is “blisters are first sign you need new footwear.”  This past week I had my first blister on my big toe.  My replacement boots are in the mail.  I am at Lickskillet Hostel in Bland VA hoping they arrive in the morning mail.

spiritman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590314,"I’ve made 700 miles!  On Monday, May 6th, I traveled one of the most difficult sections of the trail (between Pine Swamp and Baileys Gap shelters, north of Pearisburg, VA).  What made it so hard was numerous fallen trees.  Many were recent.  A fellow hiker commented “that was an obstacle course!”  What made it worse was I got caught in a pouring, pounding thunderstorm.  Another complicating factor was there had been a 36 hour, two inch rainstorm one day prior.  Creeks were overrun and raging.  There were standing pools of water 12 to 18 inches deep with no way around them.  After 3 hours I made it to the shelter, pitched my tent (shelters are always full during bad weather), peeled off soaked clothes (all water proof gear fails eventually), got in my sleeping bag and counted my blessings to have gotten to a stopping place.  The next morning everything was wet and the trail was a river.  The day was beautiful and I took a long lunch and spread out my gear to dry.  One must do what you have to do.  Putting on wet socks and boots is no fun!
I hiked toward Daleville which includes the picturesque “Dragon’s Tooth.”  I had dealt with two thunderstorms earlier in the day and at the moment I got to it the sky opened up.  It didn’t rain long but it soaked the ground and, more significantly, the rocks leading down the vertical ledges from the tooth.  There are places where support bars have been driven into the rocks.  Some ledges were less than six inches wide ... slow, tedious descent.  It took a long time and I had to wear my headlamp the last hour.  I made it to 4 Pines Hostel, grabbed a shower and got a good nights sleep. 
This week also dealt a new but anticipated reality:  the rattlesnakes are out and about.  A couple of nights go a hiker was setting up his tent in a place near mine and said:  “Hey, heads up, there is a rattlesnake and it might head your way.”  Yup, there was a medium sized rattler chowing down on a vole.  Check out the picture page ....

spiritman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591920,"Waynesboro!  I’ve passed the 800 mile mark and am spending a couple days in Charlottesville with my wife, our little dog, daughter, and grandson.  In a couple of days will enter Shenandoah National Park.  Will hike for a day with a couple of old friends- Andrew and Steve - and will keep an eye out for those old rascally bears.  
The past week was one of rain and more rain.  The trail was rugged with many creeks and rocks of every shape and size.  The rocks lurch and jolt hikers every direction.  They require tremendous mental and physical effort.  Sometimes the trail is literally a creek bed that flows water after it rains.
Some of the highlights of the week include the famous “guillotine.”  A huge boulder wedged between two gigantic rocks ... one day it will fall.  I didn’t spend much time underneath it!  Another highlight is the flowers blooming everywhere.  It is nothing short of breathtaking to see the layers of beauty that adorns the forest.  A less joyful dynamic is with the warmer weather comes the hordes of insects.  Repellent is essential and sometimes a physical barrier like netting or hooded rain jacket are needed - especially when not moving much in the evening while trying to prepare and eat a meal.
I’ve met many great folks on the trail.  Some are section hikers, other local day hikers, and others are Trail Angels who offer refreshments and counsel and encouragement.  Thank you all!  Another “shout out” for all the volunteers of past and present who have painstakingly worked to make and keep the AT a gift.  I have been humbled countless times by the rugged terrain that is passable only because of hard work and maintenance.
A final thank you to Jeff and Cheryl D who sent me a care package!!!  Loved the cookies and all the other hiking related goodies.  Thanks all for the positive energy, prayers, and love.","

spiritman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592786,"This week I passed the 900 mile mark.  It was quite the week.  I saw my first bear.  It could have cared less that I and some other hikers were taking its picture.  Shenandoah is famous for its deer population.  I encountered a mother and very young fawn (check out the pictures tab).  My heart was touched by the fawn’s vulnerability and the mother’s concern.  Another fun addition to the week was on Sunday I was joined by friends from Richmond - Steve and Andrew.  We hiked several miles and had massive sandwiches for lunch thanks to Steve who  brought and carried the load.  Thanks guys!  Great day!
This week was one of rain and more rain.  It poured every day and on Thursday we had 10 inches!!!!  Hikers everywhere had wet gear and some tents flooded.  My Lightheart Gear tent did great, but in those conditions... everything gets soggy.  Fortunately I came to a National Park campground that had a washing machine and dryer.  It is really hard to wring out wet socks and then put on soggy wet boots.  If a hiker can at least start with dry socks and then put on the wet boots it is a huge psychological lift.  The rain was so bad there was a landslide that blocked Highway 33. 
Shenandoah National Park is known for its “waysides.”  Waysides are like convenience stores for campers.  They typically have a cafe or restaurant and are known for their blueberry milkshakes.  They are yummy!!!!!!!!
Virginia is known for Whip-poor-wills.  This bird is named because of the call or bird song they repeat over and over again at NIGHT.  One night one was very near my tent and all the hikers in the vicinity were grumbling the next morning.  The wilderness is amazing but those Whip-poor-wills sure can aggravate!  
I’m taking a zero at Open Arms Hostel in Luray.  Great place and will hike out into a weather forecast of rain tomorrow.  There is a saying on the AT:  no pain/no rain ... no Maine.  Beginning Monday the typical spring weather pattern of occasional afternoon thunderstorms resumes.  I will be soaked tomorrow evening but have a hopefully drier Monday to look forward to.  
Continued thanks to all positive thoughts and prayers and for Linda and family.","

spiritman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593615,"There is a singer named Meatloaf who sings a song with the memorable chorus:  “Two out of three ain’t bad.”  I write this journal entry with mixed emotions as I am temporarily leaving “the trail.”
I started my thru-hike attempt wanting three particular pictures.  The first being me at the southern terminus, Springer Mountain in Georgia; the second at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia (touted as the “psychological/mythical halfway point of the AT”); and the third of me at Mount Katahdin in Maine, the northern terminus.  Two out of three ain’t bad as I am in Harpers Ferry and had my picture officially added to the AT archives.
I have hiked the 1025 miles, the southern psychological half, of the Appalachian Trail through weather conditions many consider the harshest in almost two decades.  I am a healthy, strong, and seasoned hiker, but there is more to a long-trail thru hike than the walking terminus to terminus with a pack.  At this moment in time I need and choose to be with my wife, elderly dog, and family as they too walk their respective journeys.
As for the future I remain committed to hiking the entire AT.  The AT will be here and I aspire to earn the next level of recognition:  “2,000 Miler.”  As for now, Two out of three ain’t bad!
Thank you for your interest, prayers, and encouragement.  This has and will always remain one magnificent journey.
P.S.  I will post a couple of follow-up journal entries soon about some special memories, gear reviews, and learnings.
P.S./P.S.  I hiked Georgia to Maryland which means I officially completed five states (Virginia is the longest).
