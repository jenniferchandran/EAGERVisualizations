I hitched a ride to the hostel, checked in, and started icing my knee. I’m taking tomorrow off to rest my whole body. Hope I’ll be ready to go Monday. Thunderstorms are in the forecast for the next several days.","Hexacuba shelter

Flatlander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598572," I flew home Wednesday. Saw my doctor Thursday morning. Got bloodwork done and seeing Orthopedic doctor next week. I am so disappointed and feeling pretty low. That's why it's taken me a few days to post an entry in the journal. I really don't want to hear ""but look what you accomplished"". It was tough to sit back and watch friends I had been hiking with move on into the Whites. Perhaps I'll reflect on this in a later post. For now, I'm waiting for my appointment and hoping it's nothing serious. I will be studying my guidebooks and looking at options if I'm able to continue. Thanks so much for all those concerned about my knee and for all the encouragement and support I received in my guest book. It has meant so much to me.","
