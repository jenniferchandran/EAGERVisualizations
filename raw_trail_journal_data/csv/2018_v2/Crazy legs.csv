Crazy legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589399,"4-19-18It was a cold, overcast, gusty start for this section hike. Jenny (Turtlestone), my backpacking partner, and I appreciated the cold though for the 5 mile uphill at the start.  Stopped briefly at the summit of Snowbird Mt. for pics by the FAA tower. Ahhh, air traffic memories!Met several thru hikers on the trail and even more at the shelter. We secured our spots in the shelter amid numerous tents set up later. Lots of NOBO’s (northbounders) were passing thru these mile markers.   Had to laugh at the “Hobbit Privy”.","I40 underpass

Crazy legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589401,"4-20-18Very cold 28 degree wake up call. I actually stayed in my sleeping bag 13 hours since early last evening. Turned into a beauty of a day though even with 90 % uphills and 10% downs. That never ceases to amaze me.  We were treated by fantastic trail magic at Max Patch Rd. crossing. Campfire, beer, doughnuts, hot dogs, chips, Little Debbies.  Enjoyed my first AT beer with Benji, the trail angel’s dog.  Ascended to Max Patch, a bald at 4629’ with panoramic views. More scenic views cheered us on to the shelter where we once again arrived before the throngs of other hikers.  Among others we met couples from Germany and Switzerland and a young girl from Thailand.  We were interviewed by a writer doing a story on trail names...Aliases backpackers use.  Love the stories behind the names of the people I’ve met. Luckily only dipping to 35 tonite. Love my down sleeping bag!  PS  Awoke at 1am remembering a “zebra cake” that Jenny stuffed in my pack as we left the trail magic. I couldn’t chance mice, bears or other critters sniffing out the tasty snack so..... I searched my pack, found the cake, debated on a quiet solution, and then I ate it.  Then back in my bag to warm up.","Groundhog Shelter

Crazy legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589402,"4-21-18Nice easy few miles to start the day.   Once again we got trail magic. This time it was PBJ’s and lawn chair seating set up as a station for day hikers raising money for Cystic Fibrosis. They were happy to share with us, so we were happy to donate for their good cause. We passed about 75 of their hikers moving southbound throughout the day.  Also met a young woman from Germany as we went up and over Walnut Mt (4,245’) with a short break at the shelter up there. Later we peaked Bluff Mt. (4,686’).  After filtering water at Big Rock Spring we searched for a tent site. Found a great spot with a super view. Had fun pitching my tent... it had been quite a while since I needed it. Used the PCT method to hang our food since no bear poles at an unofficial tent site. After dinner forced ourselves to stay awake till 8:09 to watch the sunset. Worth it!!!","Roaring Fork shelter

Crazy legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589403,"4-22-18Pleasant weather all nite and morning. Nobody else around, so quiet too. Packed up our gear and had an easy hike down except when I slipped for no apparent reason. My feet went off to the left and my right rib cage fell on my water bottle. That cheap plastic bottle didn’t even break under all that weight. It probably prevented injuries except for the bruised ribs.   We met our sherpas, Pete and Tim at Garenflo Gap where they were giving out trail magic fresh fruit. We exchanged our backpacks for our day packs and after a short break, slack packed into Hot Springs where we met the guys again at their campsites. Had another rest time before they drove us out to Tanyard Gap so we could slackpack back to Hot Springs again for 2 nites with our husbands. After a lovely shower, we enjoyed Pete’s homemade pot roast with Jenny and Tim in their cabin. Nice being with Pete and sleeping in a clean RV.","Unofficial tent site

Crazy legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589404,"4-23-18Peaceful, relaxed day checking out Hot Springs, NC.  The four of us spent an hour in a mineral water hot tub beside a large creek. Felt great especially for my ribs that were hurting even more than the previous day.  Returned to our camps on the French Broad River, just across the road. Light rains off and on, but walked into town for the outfitter store and yummy meatloaf at the Rocky Mt. Diner.","Hot springs

Crazy legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589405,"4-24-18Pete and Tim dropped us off at Tanyard Gap again to continue north this time.  As usual, saw several hikers including Half Slow who recited “Invictus” to us in the middle of the forest. He claimed we inspired him for that particular poem. Now that was cool magic.  Arrived early at the shelter on this threatening looking day just as the heavy rains started.  Lucked out again.  Or maybe not.  The mice were the absolute worst I had ever experienced in a shelter...active all over...all nite.  I felt 4 while awake. I sent one airborne causing it to squeak cry upon landing. Luckily no one had chew damage to their gear.","Tanyard Gap

Crazy legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589406,"4-25-18Hiked in the rain and clouds all day. Lots of ups and slippery muddy downs. Tim met us at Allen Gap where he was passing out fresh fruit again.  Checked our feet, ate our bananas, said our goodbyes and pushed on for the shelter. The forest was dripping wet. Our gear was all damp. We were grateful to get in the shelter again to be semi dry. Red Bush and others got a fire going somehow for a short time which helped.","Spring Mountain shelter
",Little Laurel shelter,"Apr 25, Wed",8.60
Crazy legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589407,"4-26-18Rained throughout the nite but luckily stopped by morning.  Climbed over 1,100 ‘ in 1.3 miles. Later the clouds formed around us so we finished the last few miles inside the mist. Made it to the shelter just before a heavy downpour.....again.  Breezy and damp cold all nite at 4,148’.  Around dinner time, from out of the storm in walked a domestic cat. He was orange and white with a bob tail and very clean and healthy looking. We named this sweet, friendly feline Jerry (after the cabin). The shelter journal noted he had been there before, so I guess he knew what he was doing. He ate well this nite!So...at about 1am I woke to a strange sound. Flashed my headlamp in the corner at some unrecognizable creature.  Next to me, Walk Man also was intrigued.  Turned out to be Jerry with a plastic bag stuck on his head thrashing around to get it off. We offered to help, but Jerry ran out of the shelter blindly, and never returned.","Little Laurel shelter

Crazy legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589408,"4-27-18Misty and wet to start from 5 days of rain. Went up and over Big Butt Mt. our highest point on this section at 4,812’.  It was starting to clear up near Shelton gravesite which was situated on a beautiful opening in the woods.  Had a break at Flint Mt. shelter then continued mostly down to Devil Fork Gap. With poor cell service we didn’t know Tim had had some medical issues and that only Pete would be meeting us. We drove Jenny back to meet up with Tim and decided to skip the last day of our planned section. So today marks the end of this section hike.  Once again, I’m thankful for all my experiences on this awesome trail.  And I’m especially thankful to have Turtlestone for my hiking partner and to have Pete and Tim for our sherpas. Jenny’s APP, Guthook, was great to have on our trek. Most other hikers we met had it as well.  Some interesting info it provided for our trek was:Total ascent- 17,647 ftTotal descent- 16,208.3 ftSo I guess my theory of significantly more ups than downs is not so significant!","Jerry Cabin

Pete, my husband/sherpa, agreed to my hiking alone for this section as long as he could drop me off and pick me up later each day.  Starting tomorrow I will begin hiking the 84.4 mile section between Devil Fork Gap and Bear Branch Road.  These miles run along part of the border between Tennessee and N. Carolina. I won’t necessarily be doing the 9 legs in order and not all south to north, but I will get all of the miles.  The number of miles and elevation changes among other factors will determine where I hike each day.",,View Entry,"Oct 08, Mon",0

This was a perfect Fall day for the beginning of my next section hike. It was sunny and crisp at 70* with a cool breeze. I did a reverse direction hike so I wouldn’t have so much steep uphill for my first day in the mountains.  Training in Ohio and at my age....well I did what I could, but still needed to ease into this trek. 
I saw no people and remarkably only one bird all day, but yet it was glorious in the beautiful deciduous forest just starting to turn color. I’m starting to get my mountain legs back!  Besides adding AT miles, I’m dedicating this next week to communing with nature and praying  for my family and friends, especially for a few that need extra prayers at this time.","Sams Gap

Hiked most of the day in the rain. The umbrella effect of the forest canopy kept me relatively less drenched. Enjoyed the easy hike to No Business Knob Shelter, where I took a long break out of the weather for lunch.  Yesterday I saw my first blue mushroom.  Today I spied red, orange, pink, various shades of brown and of course some white ones.  There’s still purple wild flowers everywhere.  I saw 7 southbound hikers today, 2 couples from Vermont and 3 individual guys. Lots of small critters came out after the rain finally subsided.  I ended my day with a walk across the bridge over the Nolichucky River near Erwin, Tennessee.","Spivey Gap

Heavy rain all day so did not hike. We stopped at the Unicoi Forest Ranger Station, which happened to be less than a mile from our RV campsite at Woodsmoke Campground in Unicoi.  They helped us locate a midway extraction point so I wouldn’t have to hike a 15 mile section later on in the week.  Now it’ll be a 5.6 and a 9.4, plus an extra mile added on each day for hiking in/out on a walkable forest road for access.","River Rd. / Unaka Springs Rd.

A good weather day for this reverse direction hike. Again it was to help me with the steep elevation changes.  There were several beautiful stream crossings and foot bridges.  I stopped at Curly Maple Shelter for a lengthy break and to change my socks, a practice that I love to do each day on longer hikes.   I only saw two people, a couple from Michigan on a day hike.","Beauty Spot Gap

Started at 7:30AM, just when there was enough daylight to see in the forest. I hiked in the clouds and fog for the first 9 miles.  I love the mystical feeling of the surroundings, but had hoped to have the famous panoramic views from Big Bald (5,516’).  I hiked above 5,000’ for over 3 miles and never glimpsed a view.  Being a Saturday I saw over 30 people. Most were weekend hikers, some section hikers, 3 hunters, 1 runner, and 8 young people netting and tagging migratory birds. The last 5 miles had two steep climbs and some rock scrambles by High Rocks. Hurray!!!  Today I crossed my personal 1,000 mile mark of total section miles on the AT.","Sams Gap

Started out in rain and clouds. Mostly it felt like being in the mist of the clouds.  It was a fairly easy hike to Clyde Smith Shelter, with just a few steep climbs. After the first 2 hours the air cleared.  I took a break at the shelter where I met 2 guys with dogs doing sections. The uphill trail after the shelter was beautiful with rock stairs and Rhododendron tunnels.  When I got to Little Rock Knob, the clouds and fog had moved from my area so I had some impressive views.  The forests today were especially beautiful and peaceful.  All together I saw 2 dogs, and 13 hikers, 5 of which were AT thru hikers.  I also saw 4 bright orange salamanders on the trail.  The southern Appalachian Mountains region in Tennessee is considered the salamander capital of the world.  Who knew???","Iron Mountain Gap

Another beauty day, sunny and high 70’s. Mostly soft easy path to Cherry Gap Shelter, where I stopped for my break.  A deer crossed the trail 60’ in front of me, my first so far.  My hike both up and down from the dense spruce forest atop Unaka Mountain (5,180’) was fairly steep with lots of rocks and roots making it more of a challenge for me.  I saw 11 hikers today, one being a solo woman, like me. She was from Oregon and had previously hiked the PCT.  My reward today was a gorgeous, clear, 360* view from Beauty Spot Gap (4,323’) and Pete driving up there to surprise me. It was great being able to share that with him.","Iron Mountain Gap

Thick clouds and fog prevented views from Round Bald and Jane Bald. Later the conditions improved enough to see just some of the scenery as the clouds and fog shifted rapidly in the wind.  It was rocky at the higher elevations as I was above 5,000’ for all but the last mile. There was A LOT of mud today.....so the rocks were my friends!  I hiked off the AT .3 mile to Overmountain Shelter, where I was surprised to see Pete waiting for me. The shelter is a converted, large, red barn with a stunning view of the mountains.  After enjoying this spot, we hiked out together the extra mile on the forest service road leading back to our rental truck. I met 4 other hikers today, one being from England and another from the local area with lots of useful info.","Carvers Gap

Hiked the extra mile up the forest service road at the end of Roaring Creek Road to get me back on the AT past Overmountain Shelter, where I hiked out yesterday. The trail was very muddy today. The hike up Little Hump Mt. (5,459’) had some great views and about 50 kts. of wind. Hiked down in more mud and streaming water to Bradley Gap (4,950’) before the steep climb to the top of Hump Mt. (5,587’).  The wind almost knocked me down a few times on both of these treeless balds.   The temperature with the wind chill was in the 30’s. There were more spectacular views on the second peak.  I had lunch by a rock outcrop below the summit of Hump Mt. out of the wind and with an amazing vista. I continued down through more mud and big rocks. I saw 9 people and 1 dog today, all moving south.  Two deer also brightened my day today.  Pete and I met at our preplanned location as usual.","Overmountain Shelter

Today is my last day of hiking for this section. I started in sunny, perfect, 40*, no wind weather. Immediately I entered a stunning, thick pine forest with several foot bridges over streams.  The rock path was just wide enough for the wagons that used to transport guests up to the Cloudland Hotel atop Roan Mountain back in the late 1800’s. No longer there, it is now a beautiful knoll at 6,394’ with an awesome view. I took a break there in peace and solitude.  I was disappointed that there were no other panoramic views, even though I was above 5,000’ and 6,000’ all day.  But the beauty of the forests and rock formations helped make up for it.  Overall it was a pretty easy hike. I met 11 hikers and talked to 2 trail maintenance men that shared some local info.   Mission accomplished....
84.4 mile section completed!
Thank you, Pete, for helping to make this possible.","Carvers Gap
