Latchen,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582748,"The Foothills Trail hike didn't turn out exactly how we planned. Originaly, we had planned to thru hike the whole trail, but on the third day we woke to snow and temperatures in the teens. One of our friends had rented a cabin for Thursday and Friday, so we made a group decision to get the cabin for a few extra days and hike out of there. Everyone in the group was an experienced backbacker and could have easily survived the thru hike, but the fun level would have close to zero. NOAA Weather was calling for single-digit temperatures at night all week in the mountains.The highest it got during our day hikes was 35 degrees. We were able to complete all of the trail except a section that reaches from White Water Falls to Rt. 178. We are planning on finishing up in Feburary. As a shakedown for the AT, I think the hike was a success. I was able to finalize my layering for cold weather and my sleep system. The hikes were great fun with a great group of people.","Oconee Stae Park South Carolina

Latchen,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582750,"I took an overnight backpacking trip to Pisgah Forest with some friends. We started out on the Daniel Ridge Loop Trail and picked up the Farlow Loop Trail out to the Art Lobe Trail., giving us about 8 miles for the day. We camped on the ridge where the Farlow Trail and the Art Lobe Trail meet. Although there was plenty of snow and ice along the way, the weather was so nice that a few of us decided to sleep under the stars without tents. It was great falling asleep while watching the night sky. The low was around 30, and, except for a little condensation, it was a perfect night. Sunday was mostly downhill through the ice and snow. We had a few crashes on the ice, but everyone made it back to the car in one piece. Thanks to Thomas for driving. It was a great trip! Only five weeks left before I start my AT thru hike attempt!","Brevard North Carolina

Latchen,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582751,"Planning on one more hike before I begin my AT thru hike attempt. We are going to finish off the Foothills trail Feurary 16. The trail runs around 75 miles from Oconee State Park in South Carolina to Table Rock State Park. We hiked the majority of the trail During the Polar Vortex in January. I have my 2018 AT trail guide, reservations in Georgia for the weekend before I leave on my hike, and my gear selections are pretty much set. I am looking forward to attending the ATKO in Amicalola State Park. Hope to see some of you there.","
