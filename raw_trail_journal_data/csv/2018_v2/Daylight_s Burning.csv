Daylight's Burning,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581939,"“Why would you do that?!?”
As have many wannabe thru hikers before me, I’ve spent hour upon hour watching videos, reading trailjournals, perusing blogs and vicariously living the hiker life through the stories of those who havesuccessfully overcome the Appalachian Trail’s many challenges. I’ve purchased gear. I’ve done testhikes. I’ve enlisted a trainer to help improve my fitness. I’ve convinced my wife that yes, I’m seriousabout this. (That alone took months!) I’ve walked. And walked. And walked.
In short, I drank the Kool-Aid… and asked for refills.
So it was with no small amount of puffed up pride that I just “happened” to mention to one of theinterpreters who was working with my church group on a mission trip to Brazil last summer that I plan to hikethe Appalachian Trail this year. Since the Trail is understandably even less well known in Brazil than inthe US, this gave me the opportunity to describe the Trail in all its glory – its starting and ending points,the terrain, the challenges and finally, the total length, approximately 3,500 kilometers. “And you planto walk all that distance and live in a tent for six months?” Why, yes, of course! “Why in the worldwould you!”
Hmm. This might require a bit more explanation…",,View Entry,"Jan 06, Sat",0
Daylight's Burning,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581951,"The first recollection I have of the words “Appalachian Trail” came from my Dad’s mouth.  Somehow, those words made it through the fog of my self-centered, oh so intelligent, seventeen year old, girlfriend-focused mind long enough for me to tuck them away.  Dad had a dream of someday hiking the Trail.  Unfortunately, the Dad who had dragged the whole family on occasional camping trips and who amazingly helped with Boy Scout outings and meetings also had an addiction.  To tobacco. 
Dad didn’t have an easy life growing up.  One of ten children living on a hardscrabble farm, he was lucky to get even a high school education.  As did almost every one of his brothers, he joined the military upon graduation, specifically the Navy in his case.  I don’t really know the whole story of how he met and courted Mom, but I imagine it was during his Navy days that he visited her family in Newport, Rhode Island.  Mom’s step-dad was from the same small town as my dad and had relocated to the area.  I suppose what happened is that while Dad’s ship was in port, he visited Mom’s family.  Somehow, and at some time later, marriage ensued. 
Dad was tall – 6’3” – and slender; he never weighed over 180 pounds in his life and usually weighed 160 or less.  But he was tough.  Years of working on a farm – milking cows by hand, growing and harvesting crops – had strengthened him, made him “rangy”.  I’m sure that when I was seventeen and he was forty, he could have completed the trail, though he probably would have set a record for the slowest thru hike ever.  He wasn’t one to get in a hurry.
But it was never to be.  When he was approximately the age I am now, Dad passed away of lung cancer.  
So, am I hiking for Dad?  In his memory?  No, not at all.  But I did learn some lessons from his life.  First among the lessons was the power and danger of cigarettes.  I smoked exactly two cigarettes in my life – and accidentally set the woods on fire both times!  Alright, God.  Message received!  
Second, and most importantly, I learned that some adventures, some dreams, are not to be put off.  I easily could have worked another three or four years.  Although sometimes frustrating, my job provided a sense of purpose along with the income.  But, I somehow feel that now is the time – if ever – to face the challenge that is the Appalachian Trail.  So in early November, I retired.
What is possible at sixty-two might not be achievable in even a few more years.  And, as I recently texted to a friend, this decision provides the opportunity to proceed at my own pace with no boss and no schedule; to eat all I want and still lose weight; and to aspire to overcome some pretty awesome physical and mental obstacles to achieve success.  I certainly don’t want to retire only to watch television!  Have you SEEN what’s on the tube?
So the answers to “Why would I” are, in no particular order: challenge; purpose; achievability(?); the pursuit of something bigger than I’ve ever attempted; fitness (I’ve already lost 35 pounds); and maybe a whiff, a hint, of sentimentality for an opportunity missed forty five years ago.  
I’ll also have time to think about the future and what retirement means.",,View Entry,"Jan 07, Sun",0
Daylight's Burning,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582078,"How am I preparing? 
Physically 
I began working out with an athletic trainer (Hi, Adriane!) about 20 months ago in order to prepare physically for the trip.  Since then, I’ve lost about 35 pounds and converted several more pounds from fat to muscle under Adriane’s persistent guidance and encouragement.  Although she tried, Adriane hasn’t yet managed to get me to improve my diet.  I don’t want to start liking food that is good for me just as I’m about to be able to eat any junk food I want and still lose weight!  Adriane doesn’t seem to buy that philosophy, so I resort to my go-to explanation… “All guys are idiots.”  THAT she can agree with! 
Endurance 
In addition to trying to get stronger, I’ve spent a LOT of time walking.  It’s tough to find a hill around here that compares to the grade of the Trail, but I’ve tried.  Some of the uphills I have walked backwards in order to concentrate on my quads.  I’ve also walked portions of the Palmetto Trail, the Appalachian Trail, Table Rock State Park and a couple of other mountains here and there.  None of this has fully prepared me for the daily pounding of the trail, but I tried. 
Mentally 
I have to tell you, this is the aspect that worries me most - am I tough enough mentally?  That’s also the aspect that I’ve been least able to prepare or train for.  I did spend four days on the beginning portion of the trail last April and I never woke up wishing that I wasn’t on the trail despite encountering two all-night ferocious thunderstorms and wondering why in the world the trail designers decided that we have to hike over the top of every hill that on the map.  (It seems to me that it would be much more efficient to go along the sides of the hills!)  I did enjoy my time - however short - on the trail.  We’re just going to have to see how the mental part goes.  My minimum goal is not to quit the trail on or after a bad day.  I only get to quit on a really good day.  Maybe that will help. 
Equipment 
I still don’t have my gear perfected.  I think I do have the right sleep system (sleeping pad, bag and liner) and the right backpack.  I’ve also gathered most of the smaller items such as a water filtering system, cooking pot and stove, etc.  I’m considering whether the tent I have is the one I need.  While it is certainly comfortable and held up well on my four-day Trail “adventure” last April, I’m not sure I want to work that hard to assemble my nightly abode.  Maybe I’m just too much of a klutz, but I think I want something simpler. I’m sure there is still much to learn in all four of these arenas, but I’m getting closer to being satisfied. We’ll see how I feel on March 14, the night before the Trail.",,View Entry,"Jan 12, Fri",0
Daylight's Burning,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584451,"After a great breakfast, Ann and I left our lodgings and traveled just a few miles to Amicalola State Park to sign me in as Thru-hiker Number 1093.  Then off to find the parking lot at Springer Mountain!
Some 35 miles and 60+ minutes later, we parked just north of the summit of Springer.  Since I skipped the Approach Trail (it’s not officially part of the AT), I hiked southward and upward for about a mile to the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail.  After a few pictures, the hike began for real.  A mile back to the parking lot to say some last goodbyes to Ann and then off.
While Ann was waiting for my return, she had talked with another thru-hiker of approximately the same vintage as myself.  Richard and I met up for a time at Stover Creek.  He’s an interesting guy who has hiked 890 miles along the coastline of Wales.  Sharing Welsh family roots, we had an enjoyable trail conversation until our different hiking speeds led us to part.  I did see him later at the campground where we shared a celebratory toast to new friendships.
All in all,the first day went as planned, arriving at Hawk at about 4:00 to snag one of the first campsites.","Springer Mountain

Daylight's Burning,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584453,"Finally got out of camp at about 9:30 when there was a short break between rain showers.  I decided that breakfast (biscuits and gravy, but not Mama’s home cooking by any means) would wait until I made it the short distance to Hawk Mountain Shelter, where there was ... shelter.... for cooking and a water source to replenish my supply.  I forced down some food (no Hiker Hunger here yet), repacked my belongings and headed out.
As is common, everything was uphill leaving the shelter.  Up over a smallish mountain, down to Horse Gap and up over Sassafrass Mountain, which is newbie-hiker TOUGH!  That took a lot out of me and caused me to once again (I hiked this stretch last year) to question the intelligence and paternity of the trail designers.  Sassafrass is basically straight up and straight down.  Obviously “Sassa” means “Kicks your” in some Indian tongue.  It sure kicked my “frass”.
Justus Mountain followed immediately, but rather than going over the top, the trail goes around, and although muddy, the trail was much easier.  I finally stumbled into Gooch at about 4:30 and snagged what might have been the last campsite.  Even rumors (fact, as it turned out) of hot dogs, cold drinks and beer 1.3 miles ahead couldn’t get me to move any further. A quick set up of the tent and I laid down for an hour-long nap before tending to duties for the night.  No cell coverage at all, except for a 2:12 am text that magically came through from Ann answering a question that I had not yet been able to ask!
All is good.","Hawk Mountain Campground

Daylight's Burning,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584455,"Another late morning getting out of camp.  My sleep pattern is really disrupted... I’ll sleep from about eight until twelve or one o’clock, then be awake for two or three hours, and then fall asleep again until about 7:30, two hours past my normal time to get up.  I think I was the next to last to leave camp.
Today either was easier than yesterday or I was a bit stronger.  While still daunting, the mountains didn’t exhaust me quite as much as yesterday.  I maintained a pretty steady pace all day, leapfrogging with Wardrobe (she allegedly changes her wardrobe frequently through the day, depending on whether she is hot or cold) and Sniffles (because he, well, sniffles).  They are the faster hikers, but they also take more time at their rest stops and viewpoints.  
Lunch was an amazing gift of trail magic from the Glenloch Baptist Church.  I had my fill of hot dogs (2), potato chips and a sugar free Coke.  Very kind people and a blessing to all of us who passed through today.  And they had CHAIRS!  I think I miss chairs most of all.  Logs, stumps and rocks just don’t cut it.
Supercharged by the fantastic lunch, I finished the day early, at about 3:30 at Lance Creek.  I could have managed more miles, but the next section requires that overnight hikers have a bear-resistant canister and I’m not willing to carry the extra weight to satisfy the requirement for one five-mile section.  I momentarily considered continuing onward, but then I looked at the upcoming elevation profile.  OMG!  
Oh, well.  Like Scarlet O’Hara, I’ll worry about that tomorrow","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Daylight's Burning,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584458,"Blood Mountain lived up to its reputation!  I can see how it has broken the spirit of many thru hikers... it’s like Sassafrass times 2.5 in elevation gain.  Early in the morning I saw Blood looming in the distance and it was truly inspiring and daunting.  About an hour and a half (and three mountains) later, I entered the challenge.
All I can say is that it went up and up, then down and down.  And I had to take many breathers in both directions. On the uphill it was fifty steps and catch your breath over and over again.  Unfortunately, I had my first fall on the downhill.  It happened in slow motion and I wasn’t really hurt.  Despite that, one bite at a time, I got that elephant eaten!
I’ve rewarded myself with an overnight stay at Blood Mountain Cabins.  It looks like i’ll Be sharing the space with three other hikers - Snort (when she laughs), Splash (some kind of water event on the trail) and somebody they brought along for the ride.  The shower was so good that I may take another just because I can!

Daylight's Burning,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584668,"Well, after patting myself on the back yesterday, I met the third of my cabin mates for the night. Big Luscious finished the same trail I oh so proudly described yesterday about two hours after I did.  The first thing you notice is that he’s a truly big guy (his belt wrapped around Snorts’ waist twice).  The second thing you notice is that he has a prosthetic leg. That’s right, the one-legged guy did everything I did taking only a bit more time.  Truly a lesson in humility. I was late leaving Neel’s Gap today.  Civilization in the form of real food makes it hard to get moving.  I also hung around a bit waiting on my cabin mates, but ultimately left on my own at 11:00.  A little short of 3:00, I was at Whitley Gap Shelter, our planned destination for the day.  I still felt good, however, so I decided to press on, thinking “daylight’s burning.”  Despite cold rain and dropping temperatures, I made it to Low Gap Shelter in time to catch a break in the rain and set up camp.  By 7:30 I was in my sleeping bag dead to the world.  But I had learned that I could walk further than I thought reasonable at this point in my hike and still feel pretty good.  That lesson would help my decision the next day.","Neel’s Gap

Daylight's Burning,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584673,"I awoke at about 1:30 this morning to the sound of roaring winds, easily likened to the sound of a series of 747s taking off one after another.  In addition, sleet/snow was pelting my tent.  With nothing to be done for the situation and sub-freezing temps forecasted, I snuggled more deeply in my sleeping bag accompanied by a few of my friends: Mr. Water Filter, Mr. iPad, and Mr. iPhone.  Mr. Water Bottle wasn’t invited since he sometimes wets the bed.When I awoke to the same weather conditions at 6:30, I attempted to fix a hot meal since I had skipped supper the night before.  Unfortunately, my stove wouldn’t fire off due to the low temperatures.  Hmm.  Decision time.  Do I stay here today, warm, but with no hot food, making zero miles, looking at a forecast of the same conditions continuing through tomorrow and low on water or do I pack up and go?  A quick check of the topo maps on the Internet (thanks Al Gore and AT&T!) showed that the Trail would mostly be on the leeward side of the mountains so I wouldn’t have to consider wind chill factors.  The distance to Unicoi Gap was manageable based on yesterday’s performance.  And the elevation profile was no worse.Decision made, move out.Several people left from the shelter as I packed, which help to affirm/my decision. A quick call to Ground Control (Ann) to get reservations made in Hiawassee, Georgia and I was on my way.  I made a short stop to replenish my water, camel-ing about a liter in order to avoid having to stop again.  The Trail was both treacherous and beautiful.  Ice-slickened rocks and roots concealed by a thin layer of snow led to several slips during the day.  Slips, not falls.  (I have decided that a fall is defined as any unintended contact with the ground that would result in my being ruled “down” in professional football.)  I made the trek in under five hours, encountering General (his first name is Sherman) along the way.  Having two beds in the room that Ann had arranged, I offered to split the room with him and he accepted!  Based on the atweather.org forecast, we decided we would take a zero day on Thursday.  (I had asked Ann to make the reservation for two nights.). A zero day means that no Trail miles are walked, no matter how much walking you do during the day.Thirty minutes spent with our thumbs out at Unicoi Gap and we scored a hitch with a Trail Angel named DeeDee.  Moving too fast to stop for us as she passed by, she turned around three miles further down the road and came back to get us.  It was truly a blessing that she took us the eleven miles into town, depositing us on the doorstep of the Holiday Inn Express!  Once we warmed ourselves and showered, it was off to an AYCE (all you can eat) buffet and then bed.","Low Gap Shelter

After dropping her at Dicks Creek Gap, Batman shuttled us the twenty miles to Unicoi Gap, where I said goodbye to General, who hikes much faster than I.Based on the snow remaining on the trail, we made the right decision to take a zero day yesterday.  The snow on the first peak was 4 to 6 inches deep in places!  The trail was extra soupy with snow melt, and extra treacherous. Late in the day, I experienced fall number two for this trip.  My right foot slipped three feet downhill and I ended up with my left heel lodged against my left buttock.  Those two body parts had not met each other in years due to a likely Baker’s cyst behind my left knee.  My knee screamed and I immediately had visions of the trip coming to an end. I got up and hobbled the next mile and a half to my campsite.  After texting with Ann and starting a Tylenol/Motrin regimen, my knee started feeling better.  I didn’t feel like walking half a mile down to the water source, however.  Surely, I had plenty for tomorrow.","Unicoi Gap

Unfortunately, the room in Helen is not refundable.  Another lesson in humility, and poor planning!Tomorrow, I plan to enter a five or six day stretch entirely in the woods, so no updates (or hotel expenses!!) are likely.  I plan to do the minimum miles necessary to be at Winding Stair Gap by Friday afternoon.

I knew that today was going to be a late start and I wanted to baby my knee a bit more, so I only planned a short hike, 4.5 miles to Plumorchard Gap Shelter.  Despite getting started at 1:00 or so, I was in my tent by 4:30.
While hiking, I received some bad news about a friend and spent much of my time thinking of and praying for her. I also spent some time mentally reviewing the trip so far.  I’ve come to realize that there’s always another “OMG! mountain” to come.  First it was OMG! Sassafrass, then OMG! Blood, then OMG! Tray Mountain, with more in my future, including Clingman’s Dome, the highest point on the Trail at some 6,600-ish feet.  And in New England, there are the Presidentials and the Whites, not to mention Katahdin, the northern terminus and goal for the Trail.  I’m going to try to avoid the drama going forward.
I think we may have become a the-sky-is-falling society what with “reality” TV and 24-hour news coverage of every event.  What used to be local stories are now blasted nationwide if there is video to go with them.  Much like our mission trips to Brazil, this adventure is a respite from the constant news of presidents, disasters, heartbreak and even sports.  I already have so little interest in what’s hot now that I wonder if I’ll care at all after this trip.  (But I will always care about the “Hot Now” sign at Krispy Kreme!)

Departing from the state line, the trail was still the trail.  Bly Gap lived up to its very windy reputation, so I didn’t stick around long, just long enough to share good wishes with Kent, who was ending his day hike there and hiking back to his car.  More on him in a future zero-day post perhaps.
After a 7.9 mile day, I tucked into my tent at Muskrat Creek Shelter.  Since there were only two other people there when I arrived, I gave momentary thought to spending the night in the shelter.  It quickly became obvious that the mice there were very active.  The shelter registry was mouse-chewed despite having been stored in a wooden box. The box had recently been mended with a metal plate, to cover a hole chewed by a very ambitious mouse!  Thus my tucking into my own tent.

It’s apparent that the NC trail maintainers believe in and use switchbacks to climb their mountains.  That might not be universally true, but Ive already switchbacked here more than my whole time in Georgia.  The trail is still hard, but we at least get an occasional break from the arduous uphills.

I left camp at about 10 a.m. with initial goal of reaching the next shelter about 3.6 miles up the trail. Despite the departure time, I was one of the first on the trail from our temporary city of five tents and one hammock. For once, I didn’t get passed by everybody as the day wore on.  I reached the shelter in a timely fashion and had it to myself while I cooked and ate lunch. I also took time to clean up a little and change clothes.  I’m still smelling pretty bad.
I left the shelter as Snorts and Splash arrived.  They were among the folks at Beech Gap last night and were taking the day’s miles easy, too.  On the way to Betty Creek, I was passed by a young woman named Shotgun (Andrea).  Shotgun thru hiked the trail in 2016 and is back for a month with three of her friends to “share the trail that changed my life”.  Having spent the last year or so working and hiking in Colorado, she says she finds the AT much easier now than in 2016.
The campsites at Betty Creek Gap leave a bit to be desired.  None are level and all are pretty small.  After wandering all over, I ended upon the first site I saw.  Snorts and Splash arrived an hour later and have set up camp further down the side trail toward the creek.  There are about a dozen folks here tonight.

Daylight's Burning,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585274,"I’m not sure I can do justice to this day’s events, particularly those of the latter part of the day.
I awoke to a dry tent this morning, for only the third time on this adventure and was inspired to move quickly to break camp.  A fast trip to the creek to filter a liter of water, then pack the tent, turn on the Garmin Explorer tracking device and I was on the trail by 9 a.m., headed for the first obstacle of the day, OMG! Albert Mountain.
The initial approach to Albert was deceptively mild.  Just before the last couple hundred feet of climb, the trail guidebook offers an easier, blue-blazed alternative to the official, white-blazed trail.  While I’m not a committed “purist” who will NEVER stray from the white blazes, I knew from my reading that this was a part of the trail I wanted to experience.  It was truly a fun and challenging  section of trail. Rather than the rock fields that we have picked our way across so far, this was a true boulder scramble, overcoming in some instances boulders the size of small cars.  The reward?  A panoramic view of God’s creation from the base of the Albert Mountain fire tower.
After making a couple of phone calls - gotta take advantage of the signal when you have one - I began my descent, this time in the form of a gentle footpath, almost as if the trail designers were apologizing for the earlier difficulties.  Half a mile down the hill, I crossed the 100 mile mark!  Now I only need to repeat this achievement 21 more times in order to complete the trail.  :) 
The rest of the day went pretty much as planned and by 2:30, I found myself at Rock Gap Shelter, the supposed end of my 8.4 mile day.  Another hiker was there ahead of me, massaging his trail-worn bare feet.  He obviously had cell service since he was texting, so I asked him for a weather update.  Rain, starting at dusk and continuing through tomorrow.  No problem, I’ll just stay in the shelter so I don’t have to break camp in the rain.  About then, a mouse with teeth the size of a beaver began gnawing on something between the wooden ceiling and tin roof of the shelter.  Now I’ll do a lot of things, but I’m not at all interested in sleeping with vermin.  Time to find a Plan B.
I decided that with only 3.8 miles between me and Winding Stair Gap (WSG), the gateway to Franklin, NC, I would haul boogie there and try to get a hitch to a hotel or hostel, anywhere out of the rain.  What was to have been a leisurely three hour trip the next day became a sub-two hour blast through the woods.  
The whole purpose of my original plan to be at WSG at noon Friday was to meet my wife, Ann, and then travel together to Cashiers where we were to spend the weekend with our friends, Claude and Missy.  About halfway through my trek, I hit upon a cell signal and idea at the same time.  I quickly called Ann and asked her to check with Claude and Missy to see if they would be able to take mercy on a poor, bedraggled hiker by traveling 75 minutes to pick me up.  Moments later, I lost cell coverage again as I powered onward.  Garmin to the rescue!  I soon had a satellite message from Ann that Claude and Missy were on their way!
They arrived at WSG about fifteen minutes after I did, tossed my gear in the back of the truck and brought me home to a long, hot shower, wonderful meal and comfortable DRY bed. What can you say?  Friends.","Betty Creek Trail Campsite

Richard John was the first trail acquaintance.  He’s the guy who hiked the Welsh coast.  While I enjoyed meeting him, we soon lost contact because of the difference in our hiking pace.  I’m sure I’ll run across him again if we both stay on the trail.  People once thought lost keep reappearing as you move along this narrow pathway.
Snort and Splash are two such trail mates.  It was almost a week between my first encounter with them and my next.  Snorts is a vivacious, intelligent and fun young woman.  Eighteen years old, she was accepted to several Ivy League colleges through some program available in her home state of Wis-cahnn-sin.  (Her exaggeration of her own accent.)  The acceptances didn’t come with scholarship offers despite good grades, so she decided to take an Appalachian journey instead.  Splash I know less of since he’s a guy and we tend to talk less.  He must be in his early twenties, having served in the Marine Corps.  Splash is from Pennsylvania.  
Big Luscious is the guy I mentioned who is hiking the trail with a prosthetic leg.  As far as I know, he’s still on the trail, though he had to take off to get some better gear after a freezing experience during the snow.  BL project managed a 280 city tour by a pro-life organization and is a get ‘er done kind of guy.  He’s using some of his 400,000 Holiday Inn rewards points gained from the tour to fill his need to get off the trail occasionally.
I met General as we entered Unicoi Gap.  First name Sherman and from Atlanta, his trail name pretty much chose itself.  General and I shared a hotel room for two nights.  He’s an experienced hiker and has hiked several sections of the AT.  On the weekends, he can be found hiking up and down Stone Mountain near Atlanta.  It’s obvious that he loves his daughters, whom he home schools, and his wife.  His hope is for his hike to lead him to become a better dad and husband.  We had some pretty free-wheeling discussions, from  his disbelief that I’ve never seen a Star Wars, Star Trek or DC Comic movie yet am reasonably intelligent to an open-ended discussion on race relations.  General is a former Apple employee and apparently acquired some of their stock at an opportune time, allowing him to quit his job and move east with his wife when an opportunity for her arose.
“Miss” DeeDee was on a several hundred mile clear her mind ride when she turned back to give General and me a hitch into Hiawassee.  She confessed that one of the reasons it took her a little time to turn back was that she needed to stow away her three pistols, lest we be disturbed.  :)
I told you about Bear Claw and Batman giving General and me a hitch back to Unicoi after our snow day.  Sitting in the back seat with River and (I think) Sai was a real education.  Both kids are real bright with great vocabularies.  River is going to be an astronaut.  Sai says her parents want her to be a pilot, but she really doesn’t want to be.  She wants “to be a horse feeder.”  Me: “You know that if you’re a horse feeder you have to clean up the horse poop, too, right?”  Her: “Uh-uh!”  Me: “Yes, you do.  That’s how it works.”  Her:  “I want to be a pilot then.”
“Miss” Grace was my shuttle to and from my second trip to Hiawassee.  Former law enforcement, she retired to this area from Florida.  She augments her retirement by giving shuttle rides in March and April, working security at an RV park May through November and painting (as in an artist) December through February.  Her dog Murphy (an Irish name because of his red hair) keeps her company.
When I returned to the trail from my second Hiawassee visit, Switchback ‘03 was offering hamburger and hot dog trail magic.  A past thru-hiker, he does this each year as his contribution to our efforts.
Kent will be the last of the day.  I met Kent on the section of the trail where I crossed the Georgia state line.  Kent is a real encourager and was more excited for me than I was feeling myself in that moment.  He let me know that I was only three miles from the most photographed site on the trail.  As you-can-do-anything sort of encouragement, he revealed that he was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig’s disease.  At age twenty-five.  Now 53, he has lived a full life as business owner, dad and occasional hiker.  He’s still going strong.
I wanted to give you a little more of the backstory on some of the many individuals that give the trail its character.  I hope it was of interest.","Cashiers, NC

Daylight's Burning,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585283,"For those who read a lot of these journals, there’s no reason to read today’s unless you want to quibble over my definitions.
AYCE:  All you can eat, the preferred meal of the hungry hiker
Blue-blazer:  A hiker who chooses the easier alternative trail over following the true trail.  A variant can be somebody who chooses to use a waterway to skip part of the trail.
Yellow-blazer: A hiker who skips large sections of the trail by automobile (referring to the yellow dashes between lanes on the road.)  This happened a lot in the book and movie, A Walk in the Woods.
Hike your own hike: There are many opinions on the “proper” way to hike the trail.  Choose yours.
Zero: To take a zero-mileage day, as in “I zeroed in Franklin.”
Near-o:  A short mileage day, usually entering or leaving a town.
Slack pack:  Some hostels, etc. offer to drop you off at a given trail access point and pick you up later the same day at another crossing some distance ahead.  This allows the hiker to avoid carrying a heavy pack.  Instead, they only carry water and food/clothing necessary for the day.
I’ll add more as I think of them.","Cashiers, NC

Daylight's Burning,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585843,"Thinking that I wouldn’t get back on the trail until well after lunch, I had planned a 3.2 mile near-o for today.  As it turned out, however, Ann had me back at Winding Stair Gap before 11 am, already fed and churched.  Missy, Claude and we attended a multi-denominational community sunrise service in celebration of Easter at 7:00, so we got off to an early start on the day.
After a few hugs goodbye, I hit the trail,following the white blazes east along Hwy. 64 and then crossing the road and into the woods.  Several other hikers were arriving and/or leaving as I headed out. WSG is a major jumping off point for a town day and most of us take advantage of the opportunity.
With the early start, I decided to push through to a more distant campsite so that I could complete the planned four-day hike to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) in three days.  The hike went well with almost three days of town food onboard to provide added energy.  Of course, with me having taken two full days off, most of the “bubble” of friends and acquaintances I met had moved ahead of me.  
I arrived at my destination at about 5 p.m., set up camp and tucked in for the night with very little interaction with the other folks.  I did have great success hanging my food bag using my new rope.  Yay!  So far, I have had to leave two pieces of rope hanging in trees because they got irretrievably stuck for one reason or another.  Nice to have some success!","Winding Stair Gap

Daylight's Burning,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585844,"Continuing my quest to finish this section in three days, I got a fairly early start, beating all but two hikers out of camp this morning.  The day was typical, a lot of alone time with a few interactions as I passed or was passed by other hikers.  The trail was downhill overall, but that doesn’t mean it was easy.  Downhills are exceedingly tough on the knees and hips.  Uphills are mostly just tough on the lungs still.  
I met Boo-rah! (the exclamation point is absolutely necessary to convey how he introduces himself) today.  He is slackpacking from Burningtown Gap southward to Winding Stair Gap, about 14.6 miles.  It’s amazing what you can do when you don’t have an extra 35 pounds on your back.  :)
I again tented with a bunch of folks I didn’t know - Skybird, Worm and a couple of other guys.  Skybird is section hiking for a little over a week.  Over the last ten years, he has completed all but about 150 miles in the south of the trail and 250 miles in the north.  Talk about tenacity!  All the other guys are thru-hiking, a bunch of eighteen and nineteen year olds.","Campsite at intersection with Bartram Trail

Daylight's Burning,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585847,"I’ve been keeping a good news/bad news secret from you.While Ann and I were together last weekend, we received an offer to purchase our home, which has been on the market since November.  Fortunately - providentially - we were together and had good WiFi so that we could easily negotiate our way to a mutually satisfactory price on the sale.  Contracts changed hands electronically, were signed and the deal was done.  Then I selfishly jumped back on the trail leaving everything in Ann’s hands.  
I have absolute faith that Ann could do all that is needed in order to effect the move.  But...  As I have hiked the last couple of days, I have spent time thinking and praying over what I should do - continue hiking or head home.  About midday today, I decided... my priority was to be home helping with the packing and moving.  A call to Ann to communicate my decision, slow though I was to recognize my priorities, and I was beating feet the rest of the way to the NOC.  I have to say that I remained true to my commitment not to quit on a bad day.  This has been three consecutive beautiful weather days.  
I told Ann that I would rent a car to get home either tonight or tomorrow, depending on how long it would take to get a hitch or shuttle to a town big enough to have a rental agency.  She called back a bit later to let me know that our friend, Al, would soon be on his way (3.5 hours!) to pick me up.  I reached the NOC in time to eat a “snack” - half pound cheeseburger and fries - and take a four minute (please deposit 25 cents per minute, like a carwash) shower to knock off the worst of the stink.  Because the other five hikers (Boo-rah!, Worm and the other 18-19 year olds) at my table all were continuing on and I was leaving the trail, I bought them a well deserved meal.  After all, being off the trail would save me a bunch of money based on my experiences so far!  I also was able to see a lot of friends, Snorts among them, and let them know why I was leaving the trail.  The NOC certainly is a major meeting point for hikers!  
As I sat soaking up the sun after my no-towel-available $1.00 shower, Al drove up.  A quick load of my gear and we were gone, stopping at Outback for supper on the way home.
I’m not sure when I’ll be back on the trail - or on this site.  There’s the closing on the house the first of next month, the wedding in June, Ann’s mission trip in July, etc.  I’m going to just play it by ear.
Thanks, all, for your support, prayers and encouragement.  I’m perfectly fine with my decision - no regrets - and will either section hike or figure out how to complete this hike later this year.  We’ll see!
Take care!","Big Branch campsite

Daylight's Burning,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595432,"As I recounted in my last post, I left the trail temporarily in order to move out of our house due to having accepted a contract to sell. 
It’s amazing how much “stuff”, to be polite, a family of four can accumulate in thirty years spent in one home!  What followed was almost four continuous weeks of boxing, toting, moving and stacking. About three weeks into the process, the not-so-“funny” thing happened.  Something “popped” in my right knee and I was totally out of commission for three days and limping the rest of the time through closing on the house.  Two days after closing, I was at the hospital for what was to be a simple arthroscopic meniscus repair and then back to the trail before the end of the summer.  
It was not to be.
When the orthopedic surgeon started the procedure, he found that I had a bigger problem.  Not only did I have a tear on the surface of the meniscus (which is the padding in the knee between the upper and lower leg bones), but I had also managed to partially rip the root of the meniscus free from the lower leg bone. The fix for that?  Pull out the cordless drill, punch a channel (aka, a HOLE!) through the bone and meniscus root and then cinch the two parts together with suture tape (which looks like a super strong ribbon rope.)  And then...NOTHING for the next six weeks.  No weight bearing.  No walking except on crutches.  No driving. No fun!  Nothing but what the physical therapist allows in order to keep the upper leg, the quad muscles, from atrophying like everything else around the knee.  Six solid weeks!
Fortunately, I was set free from the crutches two days before my daughter’s wedding and walked her down the aisle.  I provided some unintended entertainment - to a collection of gasps - when I got my feet entangled in her train after giving her hand to her beau.  A Texas Two-Step and I was free, unscathed!  How’s THAT for a daddy-daughter dance?!?
Unfortunately, the recovery from the more extensive surgery means I still need an additional 10 - 12 weeks of PT before I can really start rebuilding the muscles I need for hiking anything as challenging as the Appalachian Trail.  So my plan now is to pick up the Trail next March, skipping the section I hiked this year as well as the contiguous section I hiked a couple of years ago.  This means I’ll begin at the foot of the Smokies, which have the highest elevations of the southern Trail.  Nothing like starting off with a bang!  If I finish the Trail from there, I’ll return to re-hike the southernmost 170 miles to make it a true thru-hike. 
Thanks for reading and hiking along with me!","Home
