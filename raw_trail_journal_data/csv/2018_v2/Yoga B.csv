Yoga B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597274,"One day on a lovely hike with Moondoggy we found an incredible camping spot atop Kelly’s Knob. It was a warm day in June so Moondoggy set up our tarp tent in a nice shady spot under some trees. Being new to backpacking I wasn’t familiar with equipment like the tarp tent, so when he asked earlier in the week if I’d be okay in a tarp tent I had said, “Sure!”  If you aren’t familiar with a tarp tent let me describe one. It’s a small tarp hung over a rope to add the appearance of a tent with another tarp laid on the ground for ground cover. There are no zippers or anything on the sides or front to actually seal the tent. Essentially in my opinion you are completely exposed and unprotected to all the surrounding elements. I was worried when I saw this contraption but Moondoggy assured me it was the exact same thing as a traditional tent. It was not. 
That night while sleeping in said “tarp tent”, I was awoken by a sensation on my face. I grabbed my little LED lantern, switched it on, and found myself covered with about a million granddaddy longlegs. Apparently we had accidentally placed our “tent” near or on a nest of them. I calmly began to completely freak out and spew a slur of profanities and threats. Meanwhile, Moondoggy is sound asleep. It was about 4am and we were distantly surrounded by thru hikers so I had to quietly “loose my shit”.  I woke Moondoggy, explained the situation, and suggested we go ahead get up and begin our hike back. Moondoggy received the cold shoulder for the remaining hike out, and that evening when we returned home he ordered a nice 2 man tent with mosquito netting. We no longer use a tarp tent and every hiking trip I remind him of the attack, just so he never forgets. I do not recommend tarp tent camping unless you are some sort of bug enthusiast. 
I often wonder what was Moondoggy thinking, maybe the closer to nature the better the experience? Guess he didn’t realize some of us like a little more separation from nature at bedtime. 
Every hike is its own adventure so be brave and always bring a sense of humor.","

Yoga B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597271,"One day on a lovely hike with Moondoggy, (my beloved husband) and a couple of friends; Buckles and the Dude, we ran into a very interesting guy. I’ll refer to him as Ranger Shorty Pants. We were hiking to Spy Rock (Montebello, VA)  while approaching the overlook, a volunteer trail runner stopped us to talk and give some important advice. I’m a novice hiker so his ranger- like shirt and neck-kerchief lead me to believe he was some type of park ranger, well until I spotted his shorts. It seems Ranger Shorty Pants left his house one morning in some long athletic pants however,he must have misjudged the temperature that day because those pants appeared to have been roughly cut off ...probably with a knife, into make shift shorts. Like many of us, when we cut clothing, hair and so on, we usually cut a little more than we  intend to. So  to say these shorts were a tad short is an understatement. They were kinda booty hiking shorts! Anyway, what impressed me most about this encounter, was his lack of concern for his incredibly miss-cut shorts. He confidently pointed us in the safest direction to climb the rock for an amazing view. 
We climbed up and the view was astounding and made the short 2 mile -yet pretty steep- hike to Spy Rock totally worth it. I absolutely recommend the hike to all. 
It’s been a while since that hike and I often wonder what happened to Ranger Shorty Pants and I also wonder where are the rest of his pants.","

Yoga B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597273,"One day on a lovely hike with my friend Buckles we decided to take a break and have a sip of wine thus creating our tradition of Wine Hiking (Wiking).  To experience wine hiking for yourself you will need a Lexan stemless wine glass and your favorite wine poured into platypus wine flask. Typically at an overlook we will pour our yummy Blackberry Merlot in a glass and continue hiking down the trail. Hiking pole in one hand and wine in the other. This activity has gained us a lot of attention on the trail by passerbys and we have also earned the designation Wikers -not sure how I feel about that. Anyway to partake in this activity make sure you follow rules and procedures of the particular trail/park you are visiting. Also make sure to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration. 
For me hiking with a glass of wine is just plain classy. I often wonder,  can one put wine in a hydration bladder?  Well, If we pass on the trail raise your glass high and Ill do the same. Cheers .","

Yoga B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598744,"One day on a lovely hike with some friends I began to think about how weird hiking actually is. Have you ever really thought about it? We leave perfectly good homes, comfortable beds and usually an endless supply of snacks. When we hike we go out in the middle of nowhere and kinda pretend to be homeless. It’s always fascinated me why people actually choose to go hiking. It’s a choice to have the comforts of home or not. But every year hundreds of thousands of people flock to the trail with only the supplies they can carry on their back. Due to this curiosity, on many of my adventures I ask people “why hike?”On one such occasion I asked “The Dude”,why do you hike?” The Dude replied, “you can’t light up a bowl at home in front of your kids.”. He was just kidding of course. His real reason was pretty philosophical. He said it’s this really cool feeling he gets when he’s outdoors where he can actually feel the connection he has physically to the outdoors and to the trail. Well, The Dude is a pretty mindful person so I wasn’t surprised by his in-depth answer, but what did surprise me the most is how he really enjoyed sharing this reason with me and the others. I believe we all have our own personal reason for hiking,that we’d like to share if asked. Anyway the Dude is a pretty philosophical man and he often shares many of his philosophies along the trail.
Whatever the reason I’m going keep on hiking and hope you do the same.
The Dude Philosophy:
Keeping those boots connected to the earth and a joint in one hand will provide an amazing oasis for an imperfect man.","

Yoga B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598745,"On day on a lovely hike with my bff Teatime, I discovered the amazing hiking skirt. I had purchased this cute grey skirt on sale at Walkabout Sports that winter and decided to wear it for the hike because I thought it looked good. During the hike nature called probably due to all the water we were consuming and I had to pee. I detest peeing in the woods or anywhere else others than a restroom. On my way to a secluded spot behind a tree I accidentally discovered that in a hiking skirt all you have to do is separate your feet a bit and slide your underwear to the side to go. Additionally, because of the skirts coverage I was able to go without completely squatting and showing my goods to all the surrounding creatures. Literally I was able to pee standing up! What freedom I experienced in that moment! Eager to share my findings, I finished my business and ran back to Teatime to share the good news. She was equally excited about my discovery and now we both rock our amazing hiking skirts regularly. It is important to note that hiking skirts are not to be confused with hiking skorts. With skorts,the underlying shorts are not as user friendly. The hiking skirt is also a major improvement over the crotch-eating hiking shorts many of us have experienced.
The hiking skirt has defiantly improved my hiking experience, however sadly the skirt does not improve the experience of number two in the woods. Anyway keep hiking y’all.","Massie Gap

Yoga B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602846,"One day on a lovely hike with Moondoggy through the Shenandoah National Park, we came upon an amazing Wayside (tiny little shops on the edges of the road/trail) that was serving the most amazing looking blackberry milkshakes. I’ve been vegan for over a year now and I’m not gonna lie, sometimes it’s really hard. So my advice for being vegan on the trail: don’t be one, just kidding, kinda. Here’s the real advice; do the best you can do in whatever decisions you make. We need a sliding curve here and there to reduce the pressure we put on ourselves. It’s kind of funny; we act like everybody else is putting all this pressure on us to be something, for example 100% vegan, 100% conservative or liberal, 100% beautiful, when in fact, we may just be putting that pressure on ourselves. What about effort, doesn’t that count anymore?

Here’s the thing, I believe in “Ahimsa” (do no harm, non-violence) but I’m also human and I make so many mistakes, and I have so many flaws. I was the best vegan I could be while on the trail, vegan backpacking meals, vegan snacks and as many vegan choices I could make. There was not a vegan alternative to that blackberry milkshake and it was heartbreaking, so I sipped a little sip of my partner’s milkshake. Yes, I felt guilty but man it was really delicious! 
So what I’m trying to say is this, don’t avoid the trail because you’re vegan or vegetarian or whatever, just be whoever the hell you are on the trail (and everywhere else) and accept, No,  honor those flaws and mistakes that make you who you are.

Yoga B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602847,"One day on a lovely hike with Moon doggy celebrating our 22nd anniversary we began discussing love on the trail; moreover reminisce about our encounter with a couple of lovebirds atop a famous summit in Virginia a few weeks ago. The summit was pretty packed, thru hikers camping all around and a couple pitched their tent near us. In the middle of the night the couple began to “get it on”. This made me question, what is the proper etiquette for love on the trail?

 Here’s what I’ve learned. If the feeling strikes you, try to be courteous to other campers. Ya know, find some alone time in your tent, keep the noises to a minimum and have a great time. Contrary to popular belief, as a mother of three children in earshot of our bedroom, I’ve learned you can be quiet when you need to.

I’ve also learned the woods can be a very magical and romantic place. Sneaking off the trail into the woods can be quite exciting and sexy. Again, I will recommend the ‘amazing hiking skirt’ for such an adventure.  In addition, please adhere to all “Leave No Trace” policies.  

In summary, take your partner to the trail and enjoy the time you have to gather. Time slows down in the woods and it gives you more time to be together and enjoy one another. 
Life is short. Spend it in the woods.

Yoga B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602935,"One day on a lovely hike with Buckles and Ladybug we began discussing wIlderness survival , more specifically, animal attacks. My dear friend Buckles shared some good advice,    “If a black bear attacks, you fight back with all your might, if a grizzly bear attacks,play dead, and well if it’s a polar bear, you’re gonna die. Polar bears are crazy.” 
Buckles is an avid hiker and an amazing veterinarian so I trust her advice completely. Seriously, I have been actually really worried about the whole bear thing because of our upcoming long hike through the Shenandoah National Park. Her comments actually put me at ease because she gave me hope, and also in a funny way revealed my irrational fears. It was unlikely that we were going to be attacked by a bear and rare that we would even see one, especially a polar bear.  Don’t let any fear keep you from the woods. The benefits of being among the trees far outweigh the minor risks involved.
