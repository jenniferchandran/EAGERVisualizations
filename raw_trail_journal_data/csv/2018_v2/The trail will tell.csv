The trail will tell,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578118,"So, I have been reading all the advice columns, blog sites, books and other stuff out there on thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail.  I view the experience very differently from most but that is easily understood.  I am not fresh out of high school or college.  I am not on a journey to discover myself.  I know who I am and I know what I do well and I know my limitations and the things I do poorly.  Not only do I know these things, I have lived my successes and failures for over 60 years. I have challenged myself virtually every day of my life.  From my early twenties on I faced down anxiety and panic problems on an almost daily basis.  While my family was, and is, loving and has supported all of my decisions – some wise and many suspect – I have faced constant criticism and second guessing of virtually every decision I ever made.  My professional career is marked more by the battles I have fought with corporate stooges, cautious managers looking to avoid being linked to a bad decision, and obstructionist middle managers than with any form of smooth sailing.  I have lost countless battles.  But, I'm happy, love my wife of 42 years along with my children, grandchlldren, brother and sisters and my entire extended family. 
In short, while I paid the price of the eccentric scientist, I have done what I wanted to do in my own way and survived and even prospered for the most part.  Now it is time to enter my – God forbid – golden years, and contemplate my life and what it has meant.  Only I have no interest in contemplating the past.  I have never been the nostalgic type and gain nothing from sad-eyed evenings staring at old photo albums.  And I am not sure my life means anything nor am I sure it should.  It is.  I lived.  One day I will die.
So, here I am, half a year from starting out on THE Trail, and I feel compelled to write down why I am doing this.  I have no idea if I can do this, but in the event that I lose more battles but win one more war, I do agree with the many bloggers out there who advise that we should write down what our reasons are for taking on a challenge that cannot be justified in rational terms.  I do this not because I need validation and not because I care if others agree or disagree.  If that were important to me I would never begin this folly.  But I do want desperately to finish this adventure.  At 65 years old it would stand as maybe the final conquest.  And to make it to the end of the journey, you need to start the journey for good reasons.  Not anyone else’s reasons.  My reasons.  The reasons may become important on the days when I question why I ever thought this was a good idea and why I didn’t listen to those who told me I am insane and should spend my old age in front of the fire with the dog.
So, here they are.  Not in any particular order, just why this makes sense to me:

 I am agnostic on the existence of God.  I have no dog in the fight and my answer to all of life’s great questions is “I don’t know”.  I read an account of hiking the trail by a religious man who spoke to God and was sure that God spoke to him in the tongues of the trail:  sunsets, trail magic, and those too coincidental moments when something right happens when you really need something to go right.  I have admiration and respect for those that have faith.  But, what about the rest of us who don’t?  What are we left to contemplate?  What matters to us?  How do we make sense of it all?  Is “I don’t know” good enough?  Buddha told us to live an examined life.  This is the best way I can think of to do that. I have no expectation that I will emerge from the woods a changed man, but I will have time, for the first and possibly only time in my life, to contemplate the great questions.
I want to experience life in the slow lane.  I wrote a book once.  It will never be published but it made me feel better about a difficult time in my life.  I titled it “Left Lane Breakdown”.  I spent my professional life driving 80 miles an hour in the left lane.  And when you crash in the left lane, it’s a mess.  Traffic all backed up; angry commuters; one lane open; rubber necking in the opposite direction.  You know.  We’ve all been there.  Yeah, I crashed.  For once, I want to live life at two miles an hour.  No idea what that really means but I like the idea and I’m anxious to experience life at a snail’s pace.
I want to be alone.  For a while.  I often fish, hike, backpack, garden.  I do a lot of things outdoors because I prefer to be outdoors than indoors.  Its alone time.  I need it.  My wife knows I need it and is very tolerant.  Now I want to stretch the definition of alone time to six months.  I know I will meet many people on the trail and I don't want to be aloof or a loner.  I just want to spend some time with myself.  No great expectations.  Just never quite get my fill of talking to myself on day hikes and four hour fishing trips.
Just once, I want to do a grand adventure.  I have day dreamed away countless hours of my life visualizing life in Alaska; as an Amish farmer; as a stern-man on a lobster boat; and my and all other men of my time’s favorite - a cowboy.  In Wyoming.  Ridin the range.  The ultimate loner.  John Wayne.  Always a lonely girlfriend somewhere in town.  But he’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do and there was no time to settle down and raise a family.  I did none of those things.  Never seen Alaska and spent too little time in Wyoming.  Well, this is my chance for a grand adventure.
And last, I want to experience an extended period of life where all that I have is a bag full of junk I carry on my back.  No home.  No car.  No job.  Just me walking in the woods with a bag o’ stuff.  I don't know why exactly, but that seems appealing after a life of chasing rainbows, being the most I could be, and making endless comparisons to the Joneses.
When I finish, I expect to feel both exhilarated and deflated.  Ecstatic that I did what I set out to do, and at a late age.  Sad and depressed that its over and I have to return to working and civilization.  Yeah, working.  I am one of those too stupid to save for retirement so there will be no retirement.  But, with luck and the creek don’t rise, there will be one grand adventure before I ride off into the sunset.",,View Entry,"Sep 20, Wed",0
The trail will tell,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606453,"I dreamed of this trip in 1976 when I was first married.  I made the decision that I would actually do this four years ago.  I set a three-year plan, and planned to start last year, but could not.  And now, I am less than two months from the starting line.  I guess its only natural to be excited and terrified, and I am.  But the excited part is currently winning versus the terrified part.
I have been asked a lot of questions about the trip, besides the obvious ""Are you crazy?"" type of questions.  I answered the ""why I want to do this"" question in the last post.  Here, I will give a flavor of where, when and how I plan to do this.  
I will hike for about 15 days at a stretch, and hunker down in a motel for a few days to work.  Then back on the trail.  Less than ideal, and not what I want to do.  But I own a small business with my son, and I am throwing him to the wolves as it is.  I have to hold up my end of the bargain.  It will extend the trip by a month or so, which is why I am leaving a little early, on March 10th.  And the frequent breaks may limit the inevitability of injuries - shin splints, blisters and such that often send hikers packing for home.
I will start at Harpers Ferry in West Virginia and hike across the Potomac into Maryland, then through Pennsylvania.  I plan to hike for about 40 days which should take me into New York somewhere.  Then I will make my way to an airport, fly to Atlanta, and hike from Springer Mountain to Harpers Ferry, skip around the section already hiked, then north to Katahdin.  I am taking this rather odd approach to avoid two things:  the crowds at Springer early in the season, and possible snow in the Smokies.  
I plan to spend roughly an equal number of nights in my tent and three-sided log huts or ""shelters"".  Shelters are spaced every 8 - 15 miles along the trail, roughly, but hikers should not rely on them every night.  They are sometimes full, and while they provide protection from rain and wind, they have several drawbacks.  They are often infested with mice because of the easy access to food.  There can be heavy snoring to contend with (thus, earplugs are a must), sometime hikers arrive late or leave early, and there is the constant traffic of folks getting up to ""go to the woods"".  So, I plan to camp as often as possible in the tent when the weather allows, and take refuge in shelters when I need to.
I will carry about 4-5 days worth of food with me.  The trail crosses roads virtually every day, and grocery stores are within walking, or hitchhiking, distance every 2-4 days or so, on average.  I plan to carry the ingredients I need - dried vegetables and fruit, noodles, freeze-dried beef and chicken, spices, rice, dried beans and such - and I will mix and match.  I do not cook meals.  I carry a stove and use it only to heat water for coffee and tea, and to add to dried foods to rehydrate them.  A few years ago someone found that quart freezer bags are resistant to boiling water and a new era was born in backpacking:  freezer bag cooking.  Add ingredients to a bag, add hot water, place the bag in an insulated ""coozie"", wait 10-15 minutes, and eat.  No cooking and no clean up.
So, that's the overall game plan.  More on gear soon.

The trail will tell,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607319,"This is an article I sent to my local newspaper - thus the assumption of a mixed audience, not just hiking junkies!This – my last post before I head out on the trail – is just a short summary of the gear I plan to carry on my thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail.  There are uncountable gear lists on the internet from hikers of all stripes and styles, so I will not list each item.  But there are different philosophies out there.  Backpacking styles have broken down into two major camps (pun intended!):  traditional hikers and the more recent development of the ultralight crowd.
The difference between these approaches is both philosophical and tangible.  The philosophy of traditional backpacking includes heavy leather boots to protect feet and ankles, sturdy tents and sleeping bags that will withstand the rigors of abuse on the trail, and a feeling of comfort.  Traditional hikers might make camp in the mid-afternoon, set up a chair, rest and relax, maybe take a dunk in a nearby brook, contemplate the universe - and dinner.  They typically carry camp shoes to rest their feet after a day of hiking up and down mountains.  Traditional pack weights average around 25 pounds – base weight - plus food, fuel and water.  Weights might total out at 35 pounds, or so.
Ultralighters take a different approach.  They incorporate new lightweight materials like dyneema composite fabric (formerly known as cuben fiber) and silnylon that lower weights dramatically.  But equally important, ultralight backpackers will hike longer in the day, try to cover more miles, perhaps eat dinner on the trail, and only stop in the evening to set up camp and sleep.  Then off again in the morning with breakfast an hour or so later.  Ultralight pack weights average around 10-15 pounds for baseweight, and 15 – 20 pounds total.
Many other changes have occurred in backpacking. About half of all thru-hikers do not wear heavy boots but instead prefer light trail runners.  If they get wet, fine, they dry out in a few hours.  I described in a previous post freezer bag cooking – this allows us to carry light dehydrated foods and just add boiling water to eat.  Tents are now made of ultralight materials.  Z Packs makes a two man tent that weighs 14.8 ounces – just over a pound when you add in stakes and guy ropes.  Sleeping bags are available at right around a pound, and sleeping pads are available at 12 oz; less if you’re hiking in summer and only need minimal insulation. 
As seems to be customary, the traditionalists and ultralighters often clash over their preferred approaches.  Which is of course, petty.  But we are human and want to believe that we have the right answer and the other guy is wrong.  Truth is, hikers are all different and should choose what works best for them.
I choose to carry as light a pack as possible, but I can never make the grade to ultralight which, when defined, is a base weight under 10 pounds.  I always top out at 12-13 pounds, a little more in the shoulder seasons when I need cold weather gear.
Not to bore you to death, but if you have any interest in such things, my backpack is a Z Packs Arc Haul weighing in at 19 oz and my tent is a Big Agnes Fly Creek UL and weighs 36 oz.  I add a ground cloth, but many forego that as a holdover from the days of tents that often leaked.  I use a Thermarest Neoair XLite sleeping pad (12 oz) and will begin the hike with a Z Packs 5 degree sleeping bag that weighs 24 oz.  When spring arrives I will switch to my 30 degree bag that is only 17 oz.  Food will weigh right around 1 lb per day and I will carry 4-5 days’ worth.  I carry an LL Bean cotton beanie with a built in headlamp, a fleece, a down puff jacket, a fleece neck gaitor, camp socks and an extra pair of hiking socks so I can rotate them each day and hopefully wear dry socks at least some of the time.
I hike in trail runners from Hoka One One. I use the Speedgoats and the Challenger ATR.  I buy them on ebay whenever I can find the right size.  I have five pairs to start.  That may seem extravagant, but I have hiked in shoes that did not fit and it was hell.  If it takes 10 pairs and I stay comfortable and free of blisters, it will be worth every penny.
My cook stove is the standard old MSR Pocket Rocket that uses those little round propane canisters.  I only carry a pot to boil water, a mug for soup and coffee, and a spork.  No need for frying pans, bowls and such.  My total weight with everything will be around 22 pounds to start in the colder weather, and around 19 when I switch to summer gear.
I have been asked several times if I will carry a gun.  I will not. I am terrified of being shot with my own gun, and while there have been murders on the AT – 13 in the history of the trail – I have never read a journal or article from anyone that felt unsafe hiking in the woods or that recommended firearms.  Bear attacks are virtually unheard of in the eastern US as black bears are not aggressive.  I carry a small cannister of pepper spray on my belt for protection from two legged creatures.  I will likely send that home at some point.  I also carry a very light Buck knife on my belt.  Great for cutting ropes, and of course, cigars.
So, that's the gear story.  I keep it as light as I can, but I am not an ultralight zealot either.  If you have interest in backpacking, my advice is first, choose gear that you think will work for you.  Listen to advice from others, but in the end, make your own choices.  Decide first what style you might like – more toward the traditional or do you lean toward the ultralight?  Then read the blogs and websites, and choose what works for you. Most importantly, hike and test things out.  In honesty, I read and read, and I have hiked many long miles and spent many nights in the wilderness – mostly alone – so my gear is carefully chosen and tested.  But, truth be told, sometimes it was the color that influenced me one way or another.  My favorite is orange and if there was choice between two roughly equivalent manufacturers and one came in orange, well, that was a no brainer.
I’m off.  Wish me luck – I will need it.","

The trail will tell,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609636,"I left Harpers Ferry at 1045 AM on March third with an overcast sky, spitting rain, and temps in the 40s.  My family all waved good bye until I disappeared out of sight on the far shore, but it was not a promising start.  And it got worse.  I walked across the railroad bridge over the Potomac and 3 miles along the C&O canal path until the trail meandered into the woods.  Then up a set of switchbacks to a long ridgeline. It was so good to actually be walking after a lifetime of looking forward to this trip.  But the elation I had hoped to feel did not materialize. The ridge was covered in snow from a recent storm and the trail varied from snow to ice to slush.  There was deep fog with low visibility and the trees were black from the rain and condensation.  It looked more like something out of a modern Hansel and Gretel adaptation than the green tunnel I had imagined. 

 

After five miles along the barren ridge I came down to Crampton Gap and a Civil War memorial – and the famous Correspondents Memorial.  As I read one f the placards a voice said something about how quickly the weather had changed from down in the valley and how cold it was up here in the mountains. We got to talking.  He was a youn African American man and he was searching for details about black regiments from the Civil War.  We all know that there are no records of slaves, but I was not aware that African American regiments were not even chronicled in the Civil War.  But the sun was out now and the temperature rose and things felt so much better.  I hiked toward the shelter I planned to stay at and walked well past the side trail.  I asked a man and wife that hiked toward me if they knew where the shelter was. They walked me back to the turnoff. Those events are typical of many days I have had on the trail.  Just when you feel that things are bleak, you have doubts, you’re cold, whatever, someone seems to appear and brighten your day.  I had two shelter mates that night and I was thankful because it was down in the 20s – a hard way to start.  

 

The enxt day I hiked 12 miles and was exhausted when I arrived a the next shelter.  I hobbled in to find a Mom and her two daughters – from Massachusetts no less – staying as well.  We had a wonderful night although it was even colder that night with a strong wind blowing straight in to the open front of the shelter.

 

More of the same on day three.  So for the next night, I found a guest house, Sunflower Cottage, where I could warm up a sleep in a bed.  Day four took me to the northern border of Maryland, and as I approached a beautiful view at a place called High Rock (a common name it turns out) I met a trail maintainer named Mike O’Connor.  I told him where I was headed.  He had never heard of the place so he insisted that I let him drive me down into town, find the guest house, and then come back so I could finish my hike. Which we did.  And if it had not been for Mike, I would never have found it. It was about a mile past where the directions took me on an unmarked side street with no sign out front.  But the owner was a wonderfully whacky lady named Soolah Hoops.  Yup – that’s her name.  She was born Sue but she gives performances and lessons on “hooping” – you know, with a hoola hoop – so, thus the name, Soolah Hoops.  She had no central heat, the house was painted in very pretty but vibrant colors, and she had three cats and a small flock of ducks.  But when I opened the door to go out and grab dinner, a chicken walked in.  Soolah asked me to let her walk through to the back of the house because she roosts on top of the chinchilla cage in the winter where she can keep warm.  Soolah welcomed me several times to her crazy world. Yes it was.  But she was very kind, and I had a great night’s sleep and she drove me back to trail in the morning.

 

So, there are lessons here.  I am learning these much earlier than I expected, but there has been virtually nothing about this adventure that I expected.  First, there are many wonderful and helpful people in our world and you find them in unexpected places, but often at just the right moment.  This has continued to happen and, I hope, will happen again.  

 

I also realized that in our workaday world, we tend to see problems in a very pragmatic way.  Something comes across on email or on a phone call or in a meeting. OK – we got a problem.  We accept problems as nothing more that problems. Annoyances that require a plan to resolve so that projects can move forward.  When you are connected to nature all day every day, problems somehow seem more providential.  Sunshine is a gift; cold winds and rain are painful; a beautiful view is uplifting; and unexpected help from a trail angel, the kind that seems to come at just the right moment, seems some kind of reward for all the effort and sacrifice. You can use whatever words you want for where the unexpected and unplanned good and bad things come from, or if they come from anywhere at all, but out on the trail, by yourself, it seems like the Universe is either smiling on me, or hates me. And it seems to change rapidly.  I lurch from “Wow, this is great, do I deserve this?”, to “Oh man, what did I do now?”.  I wonder about the shift from nature-based cause and effect to pure pragmatism of problems and solutions.

 

It was a cold, snowy and windy start.  But winter, like so many things, cannot last and spring must come sooner or later.","Harpers Ferry

The trail will tell,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609638,"I crossed into Pennsylvania on yet another overcast and cold morning.  Within a few hundred yards from where I started that morning I crossed the Mason Dixon line.  Seemed like a milestone – 40 miles and one state down.  
I appear to have made a key miscalculation.  I am the first “flip-flop” northbound thru-hiker to leave Harpers Ferry.  Which means that I hike alone and sleep alone.  After the second night, I have spent every night that I was not off the trail, alone.  Many shelters and a few nights in a tent.  But always by myself.  There are a few day hikers, and even fewer folks out backpacking.  But so far I have met only one guy out for any significant stretch of the trail. His trail name was Stitch and he was section hiking Pennsylvania. We crossed paths several times but always seemed to be heading to different places and never got a chance to hike together.
Given the weather – cold – I admit that I have been doing a lot of what we call slackpacking.  I stay in an inn, get a ride to a trailhead, hike all day, then get a ride back to the inn.  Done that several nights.  And right now I am off the trail to catch up on work.  
But from here, I plan to stay on the trail for longer periods.  Its time to just do this no matter what the conditions.  The forecast is for a lot of rain, but warmer.  So, off I will go tomorrow and take what comes my way.  I have been told that I face the hardest parts of Pennsylvania between here – which is Hamburg, PA, home of the largest Cabelas store in the US – and Delaware Water Gap.  Lots of rocks, steep rocky climbs, and even some scrambling on all fours over large boulders.  And some of it will be in the rain.  Oh well, I suppose its Karma since, up until now, the terrain has been fairly even.  The general pattern in Maryland and Pennsylvania is climb up out of a gap to a ridge top, walk on level ground for some miles, down into a gap, back up on top and keep going.  There have been sections of rock hopping, and a few rock mazes to navigate, but nothing troubling so far.  A little while back the trail meandered through farm country.  Passed by horses, cows in the fields, and lots of cornfields, minus the corn of course.
One interesting phenomenon is that the woods at the tops of the ridges are silent and barren at this time of year.  It is still winter up there, although the snow has now melted.  No leaves on the trees, no plants coming up, and no signs of wildlife. I hike in total silence.  Twice there have been spring peepers, a few frogs croaking, and many calls and sightings of pileated woodpeckers.  And lots of black vultures that I sometimes yell at:  “Get outta here, I’m not dead yet!”.  But the aloneness and the lack of life in the forest has dimmed the nature part of the experience.  Which has led me to just make miles now.  The longest day so far was 20 miles, but that was out of necessity. My sleeping pad blew out on a sharp rock that I didn’t see when I pitched my tent.  Tried to patch it; didn't work.  Then grabbed everything I had to put under me, but for the most part I spent the night in my tent sleeping on cold ground.  Not much sleep and mighty cold.  So, a long hike to here where I bought a new sleeping pad.  But I am getting my trail legs now.  I can hike all day and not feel exhausted - a huge difference from a month ago.  
So, Ive covered 200 miles in 17 days of hiking.  And I remain optimistic. It’s warming up, spring is coming, I will be out of Pennsylvania by the end of this week, and I have only a month more alone.  I hope to make it into Vermont by early May, then travel to Georgia where I should meet more hiker trash like me.","Mason Dixon Line
