Frosty and Roadkill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596560,"I found out about the Appalachian Trail in 2008. At the time I intended to thru-hike the trail in 2014 because all of my children would be high school graduates. It was important for me to ensure they reached adulthood before I set out on a crazy adventure called the Appalachian Trail thru-hike. I remember giving myself a handle: HikingChick2014 as part of my goal setting. 2014 came and went because life has a way of doing that but the life that happened was grand. In the meantime I read every single thing I could get my hands on including published trail journals, how-to books, and magazines. 
I bought my Sierra Designs 20 degree mummy sleeping bag, on sale, back from Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) in North Carolina on a weekend in 2008. My kids and I hiked to Wesser Fire Tower and stayed at a cabin in the woods and realized that we were literally around the corner from NOC. My fascination with the AT was still very new and purchasing that sleeping bag was my commitment to hit the trail. It would take 7 years for that to Happen.
2014 was a rough year for me. A major change happened at work which caused me to rethink what I want to do to make life more fun. I decided to start working out with a personal trainer with the goal of getting outdoors more. I lost about 25 pounds and was ready to get going on my outdoor life. In fall 2015 I purchased a backpack from a store called River Sports Outfitters in Knoxville, TN. The salesperson was a former AT thru-hiker that had a lot of knowledge to share and extra time to spend talking me through my very first purchase of a Gregory 36L backpack. I still had not hiked but planned to do so come spring. When my kids gave me a gift card for my birthday in January 2016 to purchase hiking books I returned to River Sports and spent time with the same sales rep to purchase a pair that would work for me. I landed on Salomon X ultra mid GTX MID TOP hiking boots.
March 5, 2016 I took my first hike up Frog Mountain with a hiking club. I was slow. I was lighter but my heart was not strong. I breathed like I was near death and I was ill prepared (backpack and boots do not qualified as prep for a winter hike). I didn’t even make it up to the top of Frog Mountain. I stopped ¾ of the way up and so did the hiking club’s sweeper. I was disappointed but driven to get into the woods. Lesson learned: If I hike alone I won’t hold anyone up.
March 25, 2016 I hiked to Charlies Bunion just off the AT. My picture at the top says it all. I was officially hooked on hiking and on mountain top pictures of triumph.",,View Entry,"Mar 25, Fri",0
Frosty and Roadkill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596564,"Fire tower hikes are, by far, my favorite.  I want to go up to the top of every single fire tower in the United States.  Mt. Sterling happened to be my fire tower of choice on January 8, 2017.  I packed up for a winter hike with all the safety and security needed in case I got caught in a storm at the top of Mt. Sterling.  It was quite an adventurous hike.  It was also quite cold but I loved every minute of it.  I remember sitting at the top of the mountain, alone, eating lunch while sitting on a piece of Tyvek and telling myself that when I decide to spend the night for the first time in the woods, it would be at the top of Mt. Sterling.  On September 10, 2017 I started out on my trek.  I had read everything I needed to about lightweight gear.  I was in a position to buy really nice gear and did.  I felt confident in my gear and in my ability to hike a long distance.  I had hiked a number of long hikes of 10 – 16 miles in all types of weather and in every temperature.  I decided to take the long route.  After all a thru-hike requires long distances over multiple days I better get going and train for it.  Here is the post I made the day I finished the hike:
I just completed my first overnight backpack/camping trip and found my breaking point. Not sure if anyone in this group can resonate with me. 
I hiked Mt Sterling back in January on the Mt Sterling trail. It was a ""short"" hike compared to what I usually do. Decided that day that Mt Sterling would be my first overnight when I finally got the guts and the gear to do it. 
Last night I finally did it. Big Creek to Swallow Tail Falls to Mt Sterling (Campsite 38) and back down Baxter Creek. According to GSMNP (18 miles). I've never wanted to quit or cry on a hike. Ever. Yesterday I was done and I'd been preparing a year for this trip by buying UL gear and getting long hikes under my belt. About 2 miles from Mt Sterling I nearly planted my tent right on the trail. I laid down on my back and thought about hiking the 10 miles downhill back to my car. I was done. Done. Done. Done. 
In desperation I asked the Lord to bring me help. I had Charlie Horses in both calves and my back was buckling under the weight of my pack. 
1/2 mile from the top about 20 college age adults from India came bounding down the trail with a music player screaming Indian music. The last 5 in the group took one look at me and asked if I was okay. Then one of them

took my pack, two others took my arms and held me up and two walked behind me making sure I didn't fall backward as we walked the last 1/2 mile of trail. Humbling. Embarrassing. Overwhelming. 
I hugged them, set up my tent, blew up my mat and pillow, unpacked my sleep bag, hung my food bag, took off my boots and crawled in. I didn't cook in my titanium pot on my new pocket rocket. I didn't eat my pasta and ready made bacon. I didn't hammock and enjoy the sky. I didn't build a fire and make Jiffy Pop. 

I got up in the night 3 times to pee. My 20 degree bag was no match for Mt Sterling winds. Praise God I had an emergency blanket. 
Coming down Baxter Creek around mile 4 I was done again. My feet are like raw meat (yes I had moleskin on and smartwool socks). My knees were throbbing, both ankles were turned and took a solid fall that almost took me into a ravine.
I've hiked many 8-15, one 18 and one 20 mile hike. I've run 2 half marathons in the past year as well as 15k and 10k runs but I misjudged this hike and my ability to hike this much in one day.  Lesson Learned:  Hike realistically.  The trail isn't going anywhere.",,View Entry,"Sep 10, Sun",0
Frosty and Roadkill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596568,"This is my official thru-hike prep entry.  The first question most people wonder is the start of my thru-hike is starting at Davenport Gap, TN in the Smoky Mountains and not at Springer Mountain or Mt. Katahdin. Well, I’ve never been very conventional in my personal life.  My thru-hike is no different.  An email went out to all the members of the Smoky Mountain Hiking Club asking if anyone was interested in joining a team of volunteers who would work with the National Park Service (NPS) to do shelter surveys on all shelters/privys/bear cables/tool boxes located on the AT in the Smokies.  I raised my hand to type a response email accepting the opportunity without thinking much about it.  My thought was that a hike with a few other people for multiple days would be a great way to kick off a longer hike since the longest time I’ve spent in the woods was a single night. 
We started preparing a few months ago with decisions about what shelters we would stay in and how far we would hike each day.  As the Smokies go, the bears are in charge, so we’ve had a number of agenda changes due to shelter closures.  The plan was to prepare to stealth camp in case the shelters were all closed due to bears or filled with other registered hikers.  That’s the plan I went with and prepared my pack accordingly.  
After a few overnight stays in the woods I realized a few things about my backpacking habits.  I overpack and I bring too much food.  I made sure that all the gear I purchased qualified as “ultralight” or UL so that I could maximize the weight I could manage and still backpack long distances.  My goal was 30 pounds.  My trial runs had my pack above 30…more like 33.  That’s a lot of pack weight.  That is too much pack weight yet I don’t have any frivolous items in the pack.  However, if my pack is at the 30 pound mark, then there is frivolous items in the pack and I have to accept that I’m a bit bougie with my gear but going UL with food is very difficult.  Food and water are by far my heaviest gear.  Neither of which I can leave behind.

For several days I weighed every single piece of gear and every item I have in my pack in order to get an idea of my general pack weight.  My calculations came up in the 24 lb mark.  Math is fun but it’s not my strength so my calculations were clearly off by a few pounds but not enough to concern me.  On June 6, 2018 I took my pack to the US Post Office to weigh it and was pleasantly surprised it weighed only 26lbs 14oz.  That pack included:

Gregory Deva 70L backpack, Sierra Designs 20 degree sleeping bag, Tensor Insulated sleep pad, Exped inflatable pillow, Eno Sub6 UL hammock and Helio Straps, REI hammock tarp, hammock bug net, Marmot rain parka with pit zips, Crocs camp shoes, Sawyer Squeeze water filtration system, 2 Smart Water bottles (2L), Platypus Dirty Bag, Sea to Summit camp towel, sleep clothes, spare socks, toileting items, bathing items, foot care items, bug repellent, bug head net, fire starter/matches, first aid kit, 1lb 6oz food per day – 3 days with a resupply at Newfound Gap on day 3.

Bear activity, shelter closings and reopenings, and a mandatory backcountry campsite stay required because of a full shelter has changed the contents of my pack. As a result I’ve dumped the hammock and straps, bug net and tarp.  I’ve replaced it with my Big Agnes Copper Spur UL1 tent and footprint, Outdoor Research bug bivey which will add an additional pound to my pack.  I’ve contemplated adding a blue Tyvek tarp to put down on the shelter floor to add another layer/barrier under my sleep area.  But every item added is additional weight.  Ounces equal pounds and pounds are heavy to carry.  The plan is to reweigh the bag on June 8, 2018, the day before we depart, to get a final pack weight. Will I dump more weight at the resupply on day 3? I cannot imagine what I could offload to lighten the pack and still hike with the bare necessities.  I will know in about four days…",,View Entry,"Jul 07, Sat",0
Frosty and Roadkill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596642,"The best laid plans don't always pan out and that is the case for the start of my hike.  What was suppose to be a 7 day, 75 mile hike, has turned into a 5 and a half day, unknown mileage hike.  What was suppose to be an entire hike on the AT has turned into a 3/4 hike on the AT and two days in the back country.  What was suppose to be a hike from Davenport Gap, TN to Fontana Dam, NC has turned into a hike from Davenport Gap, TN to Silers Bald, NC and then down to Elmont Campground via two nights in the backcountry.  In my professional life I'm ""Semper Gumby"" which means always flexible and I'm quickly finding out that my life in the woods requires the same thing. The Smoky Bear and his crew are in charge in the mountains and they decide when and where they will roam.  They decide which shelters they will invade.  And the bears are the reason why the best laid plans didn't pan out.  Three of the six shelters we planned to stay in are closed to everyone except thru-hikers due to serious bear activity such as bears stealing hiker food bags, slashing tents, bluff charging hikers and walking into shelters.  Those of you that know anything about the Appalachian Trail you realize that a hiker on the AT is called a ""thru-hiker"".  Because I didn't start my hike 50+ miles outside of the park, I'm not considered a thru-hiker to the rangers in the Smokies so tent camping on the trail is not permitted so have to follow the hiking plans of the group instead of staying on the AT and continuing to Fontana.So that's the update.The hike must go on.  I must remain Semper Gumby.  I start Monday morning, July 9 2018 and will knock off at least a few miles of the AT before venturing off trail to two back country campsites for the conclusion.  I expect to learn much along the way, probably hone a few of my techniques, and possibly whittle down my gear a bit more.  After my final pack start weight of 29lbs 14oz still feels heavy on my back despite a great fitting backpack.  I suspect I may end up with an ultralight pack in the future but that's a journal entry for another day.  So off I go...",,View Entry,"Jul 08, Sun",0
Frosty and Roadkill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597535,"Hiking is easy from the comfort of a vehicle.  Period.  In my mind we are going to conquer every mountain and celebrate at every mountain top.We are going to hike for miles and miles while still taking the time to enjoy the views, the flora, the fauna, and all the scents that a hiker experiences while in the woods for days on end.Bears! Eh, bears!  Yes, you thwarted our intended plan to hike from Davenport Gap, TN to Fontana Dam, NC but we shall go on.  I may have seen a plethora of snake pictures on the Hike the Smokies FB group but heck, we are about to enter their territory so I am ready to squeal, step over, skirt around, or wait for the serpent to pass if necessary.  Ticks...what is a hiker to do except use a strong repellent (preferably not DEET) and tick check every night.  Bugs, mainly mosquitoes, are a fact of any hike.  Some times during the year the bugs are worse then others but I'm armed with a bug net for my hat, a repellent with Picaradin, and Benedryl should I succumb to the pests.  The sun, well, I welcome the sun as a motivator to hike back in to the shade.  The rain that the Weather Channel says we will experience every day just needs to be a bad weather report.  After all when are the weather men ever right anyway?Our hiking friend and accomplished thru-hiker, Cindy, has us loaded up in her Subaru and surprised us with Panera Bread Crunchy Cinnamon Bagels while she drives us to the trailhead. I ride shotgun because I get car sick.  I know.  Lame but it's true.  I'm pumped but I'm nervous.  In my mind I am ready for this trek.  I have mentally prepared.  I have prepared my gear until I can prepare no more.  My food stash is well thought through and despite the fact that I haven't been to the gym in 6 months due to back to back leg injuries, I feel confident my body can handle the workout I'm about to have.Riding in the car is a chat fest on a variety of topics including bears, weather, the beauty of the mountains, the view from Neil's home, work, our expectations, and last minute questions of our thru-hiking friend.  Riding in the car we've already conquered this trek.  We talk about what the last day will be like. It's total euphoria from my perspective.  I've waited for this day, for this ""kick in the rear"" to hike/backpack overnight for more than two days, for over a year and I'm about to step into the reality that this is happening.Stepping out of the car at Davenport Gap was only the beginning.  A quick tinkle in the woods, two swigs of water, a few Excedrin and two Motrin,  a quick load of my pack on my back and I was ready to take on this incredible adventure I've helped plan for months.  Whatever my concerns were, they were now officially shelved.  There is no turning back once the official picture of the start of hike is taken.  And off we go...",,View Entry,"Jul 10, Tue",0
