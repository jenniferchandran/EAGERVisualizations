Met 6 TH SOBOs at Wolfe Shelter, leaving as I arrived. Lots of day hikers in Humpback Rocks area.
Too long a day. Pack shifty, unbalanced, top-heavy. Ended up with bad backache, particularly after adding extra 2.5 liters of water for dry-camp. Backache made it hard to set up camp. 
Shoulder strap water bottle holder broke, wtf, been using it for 6 months. Lost washer for water filter, have to switch to Aqua Mira drops — have to wait to drink so can’t camel-up at water stops and thus have to carry more water.","Rockfish Gap, AT mi 862.9

Commentary:
Quiet night, bit of traffic on BRP above me and dogs barking in distance. Mild and breezy. Took almost 4 hrs to get up, eat, crap, break camp, and fiddle with pack loading (!?). 
Hot sunny day, super sweaty on climbs. Back much better, pack riding much better. Discovered soap dropper bottle leaking mess at Maupin Field shelter. Met trio of 60-ish trio of day hikers climbing Three Peaks mtn for excellent views at Hanging Rock — buzzards wheeling below, endless green peaks. Tough, long, steep descent from Three Peaks. Passed by a solo uber-TH SOBO doing at least 4 mph. Heard later he was headed for Priest Shelter — another 9 mi plus 2000 ft down and 3100 ft up (!). At another view spot partway down, full bags of trash plus a crap and TP, no cover, 1 ft off trail.
Harper Creek Shelter is nice spot. Three 50-ish guys from NJ on last night of long-weekend trip at shelter. No bear pole, no good bear-hang branches. Camped across creek from shelter.","Tent site at AT mi 845.7

Commentary:
Quiet night with rushing Harpers Creek as soundscape. Morning a bit quicker, but I discovered I left my soaker jar and spoon behind when I unpacked for dinner at The Priest Shelter.
Left camp just ahead of trio I met at shelter, SOBO for their last morning to car at Tye River.
My day was focused on the 3100 ft climb up from the river to the summit of The Priest mountain, in 4 miles. Saw no one on trail all day.
One guy arrived at the shelter ahead of me, my age and section hiking my trip, except NOBO (Damascus to Rockfish). His trip was interrupted mid-hike by Florence. Says he’s passed a lot of SOBOs just ahead of me.  He is carrying a bear canister — 2 lbs penalty and limited volume, but convenient with great piece of mind. Later maybe 10 people showed up, mostly SOBO THs, some in the shelter, some in tents, some back up to tent sites at the AT junction at the ridge line; at least a couple hammockers did that.
Had a hard time finding a good spot to hang hammock below shelter. Lots of too-small trees between tent sites, and just scattered giant trees, many too large for my tree straps. Probably spent two hours trying spots until one worked. It rained for 15 minutes in the middle, with me scrambling to cover everything and trying to get my rain jacket. Then I wasted another hour trying to hang a bear bag - few suitable limbs, many blocked by smaller trees; plus my arm is weak and my aim terrible. In the end when I hoisted the bag the limb broke and it was too late to try again. Hangs so far, 0 for 3.
Since spoon and jar are gone, have to eat finger food and can’t soak until the full jar of peanut butter is empty. Pure peanut butter is messy to eat with fingers, worse since cleanup options are limited. 
Discovered phone battery crashed from 50% to zero with nothing running, in airplane mode. Battery is shot. My Ancor backup battery works, but is running down. The Spot satellite device in standby mode and NOT tracking ran down today (2 1/2 days) to near zero as well. It’s advertised to get 20 days on one charge when doing low rate tracking. I don’t understand how to use it, I guess. I charged it up and then powered it down.
Need to replace phone. Will talk to Asta about how to proceed.","Harpers Creek Shelter, AT mi 836.0

Commentary:
Windy overnight. Had to adjust tarp but it was still a bit noisy. Wonder how the hammockers on the ridgetop fared.
An easier day trail-wise. Mostly good tread-way, gentler grades, no big climbs or descents.  Shelter empty when I left, last one to leave. Saw only person all day on trail, a day hiker who crossed well ahead of me headed for Spy Rock.
Debated what to do about spoon, filter washer (not sure how long Aqua Mira supply would last), and most importantly, phone. I turned phone off as far as Spy Rock trail junction. I could jump off AT at Spy Rock Rd & head 2.4 miles w and far downhill to general store in Montebello VA for spoon and hopefully washer then climb back up. Getting a phone and getting everything transferred and set up would require going off trail for some time. I thought about going home for a week to take care of it.  At the Spy Rock Trail junction I called Asta, who talked me out of that idea. She agreed to drive down to Lexington or Buena Vista to meet me on Saturday, get a new phone and transfer stuff to it, and bring replacement gear. Thus buoyed by the support and pep talk, I carried on.
I stopped for the night at an “unofficial campsite” (as Guthook calls it), about halfway from The Priest to the US-60 junction into Buena Vista.  The spring Guthook noted at 818.2 had moved considerably downhill (despite Florence), not worth a bushwhack. The campsite location is wrong in Guthook, as comments have noted.  After getting to the campsite, I emptied my pack and walked back n to the Lovingston Spring Trail and headed down it towards the sound of a gurgling stream for water. Ate peanut butter using a stick. Still lots to go to empty the jar for a soak container. Interesting night: see tomorrow’s entry.","The Priest Shelter, AT mi 828.4

Commentary:
Lost sleep at tent site due to coyotes very nearby howling & barking from 0130 to 0430 and an insect imitating 10 minutes of an emergency alert signal — random-length VERY loud buzzes from 0.5 seconds to 5 seconds long with maybe 0.5 second between each with the same tone and timbre as the EA signal. Weird. Also several owl species hooting all night: interesting, not disturbing. Light rain 0200 To 0400.
Lots of day-hikers out of Hog Camp Gap to 360 deg views in meadows on Cole Mtn Ridge — spectacular.
Missed the 0.3 mi trail to spring at Hog Camp Gap, so had to take 0.5 mi trail to Cow Camp Gap shelter for water; arrived 12:00. Considered whether to end day there — nice spot — or head in to Buena Vista a day early. I decided to carry on after lunch.
Outside of knees very sore towards end of day on uphills and more so on the steep downhills.
Was able to arrange room & shuttle with cell service s of Cow Camp Gap.

Rainy, windy, loud night. Shelter has tin roof, so every drop was amplified. Everything in shelter damp from blowing foggy mist. The 3 SOBO THs slept til 07:00, and apparently tend to hike until near nightfall.
Really foggy and gloomy most of day. Light rain at times. Hiked under “The Guillotine” rock, too foggy and dark for photo. Crossed peak of Apple Orchard Mtn, elev 4225, in deep fog — could barely see the bottom of the golf ball antenna beside the trail, much less any spectacular views.
Ended up at Bryant Ridge Shelter, a big, 2-story affair with a big covered porch. No good tent-site or shelter options noted in Guthook for a few miles beyond there. Next shelter, Cove Mtn, too far, and with no water source(!). Plus the crappy weather. Stayed in shelter. 
Planned out stops to next resupply and mail drop, in Daleville VA, in about 30 mi, in 3 days ( Saturday). Sent Asta texts (via satellite!) to arrange the mail drop.
Eventually, 3 SOBO THs arrived. Four of us in a space for at least 12 plus room on the porch.","Thunder Hill Shelter, AT mi 771.4

Uneventful night. Warm, not much rain. After leaving, rain started and increased in intensity throughout day. It was too warm to hike in rain gear. Midday the wind began to increase while the temperature began to drop. I started in convertible shorts and a tee shirt. Along the way I zipped on pant legs and put on my rain jacket with hood up to cut the wind — soaked to the bone already, it wasn’t going to keep me dry. The trail was becoming a waterway — pools on the flats, a creek on the slopes. When I finally climbed up to the Blue Ridge ridge-line and got the full force of the wind, I witnessed the top 20 feet of a 30 ft dead tree trunk at least a ft in diameter break off and crash to the ground. It was about 100 feet ahead of me and off to the side of trail , but still sobering.  All the time I needed to keep moving to stay warm.  The AT crosses the Blue Ridge Pkwy at Mills Gap Overlook, on the ridge-line, completely exposed with no trees cover on either side.  With horizontal torrential rain and howling winds the full severity of the storm was apparent. I stopped for a minute to empty my trash in a receptacle there, and a SOBO TH I’d passed a few times emerged from woods still in tee and shorts. Hypothermia seemed a possibility, but he was pressing on. It took a bit of searching to find the trail on the other side because of the poor visibility, and I followed where he disappeared into the woods down the road.
Fortunately Bobblets Gap Shelter is only about 1.5 miles from there. When I arrived about 14:30 he was there along with 2 SOBO THs that I started the day with. All were drying off, grabbing a bite, and changing into warmer gear. In the process the floor of the shelter got pretty wet. They — being THs — were pressing on to the next shelter, 6.5 mi, for the night. I stayed. Eventually another solo SOBO showed up and we spent the night. The rain tapered off, but wind continued. We hung stuff to dry on a line under the eave in front of the shelter and hung more stuff inside. The floor dried some from the cold draft coming up in the spaces between the floorboards.","Bryant Ridge Shelter, AT mi 761.2

From: 747.7, Bobblets Gap Shelter

Stats:

Commentary:

Cold and very windy last night, with drafts between the floorboards of the shelter. The stuff hanging across the open front of shelter mostly dried out; stuff hung inside, mostly not. I got a late start after sorting and packing wet vs. dry clothes. My usual tee shirt was the wettest; I hung it on the outside of my pack to dry. I changed into damp underwear, pants, and socks; my shoes were still pretty wet. The day started clear, windy, and cold. I think it’s the first time this hike when I started out dressed for cold: fleece beanie, gloves, a puffy jacket, all (thankfully) dry.

The first four or five miles paralleled the Blue Ridge Pkwy along the ridge, crossing the parkway and the ridge crest number of times. The gushers from gullies across the trail were dry but still evident. Depending on where I was, the microclimate varied from warm to cold. On the compass southeast side of the ridge, protected from the wind and in full sun below a parkway overlook with no trees, it could be very warm; near the top of the ridge on the northwest side, in deep shade but exposed to the full force of the wind, cold. The SOBO AT then descends on the trail-west (compass northwest) side of the ridge, crossing a number of small creeks and what normally would be dry washes. The creeks were still really high from yesterday’s deluge, covering the rocks you’d generally use as stepping stones. My choice was to wade across shoes on, thus soaking my shoes, socks, and feet repeatedly. The alternative is time-consuming, tedious, and somewhat dangerous; remove shoes and socks (maybe removing pack and putting it back on), wade across slippery rocks in bare feet, try to dry off feet on the other side, get everything back on, and repeat a few minutes later at the next crossing. (My two-layer Wrightsocks are hard to put on properly even after drying feet; the liner layer tends to stick to the slightly damp skin and the sock rolls halfway inside out, making it hard to get the seams where they should be. Mornings, with dry socks and dry and not swollen feet, it’s not a problem.)

My plan was to hike to Fullhardt Knob Shelter, 13.6 mi, for the night, and then do the remaining 5 mi to Daleville and the Howard Johnsons Express motel tomorrow morning. I got to the shelter trail just before 16:00; with 5 mostly downhill miles, 2 and a half hours of daylight remaining, and a care package and real bed awaiting at the end in Daleville, I decided to press on (despite sore knees and some hotspots on the tops of my right toes from 2 days of wet feet.)

The last two miles, after the descent from the knob, included a couple of short but moderately steep ups and downs over low hills (100-200 ft). My knees definitely felt it. I got to the US-220 crossing shortly before 18:00. The most dangerous part of the day was crossing US-220 at rush hour -- 2 busy lanes each way with no breaks in the traffic, particularly on the northbound side. Fortunately, it has a wide grassy median at the AT crossing.

The motel is close to the AT with just a BP gas station in between. I believe the whole place had been repainted recently, so it doesn’t look so bad. The room was basically clean, the but carpet and curtains really filthy. I’m not sure most of the electronics in the place actually work, including the door card reader (died the next day, needing new batteries), the TV remote (needed new batteries), wifi (one bar or nonexistent, even in the common areas; I never got a connection). The advantage over the Super-8 across the road is that HoJos does have two washing machines (one actually working!)  and dryers. No detergent though. I had to hike to the Kroegers down the road (0.5 each way) for detergent. (My knees were much happier not schlepping the backpack.) I needed 1 pod; I left the other 17 at the front desk for future hikers. I took a shower and ordered a pizza and a salad for delivery, leaving laundry for the morning. Altogether it was nearly a 20-mile day.","Bobblets Gap Shelter, AT mi 747.7

Tough day despite modest stats due to endless short, steep ups and downs after the initial descent from McAfees knob, compounded by the rough, rocky trail on ridge s of VA-311.

A couple miles later, on the easy descent, possibly scarier than the ascent to Dragon Tooth was encountering a hunter in full camo with a high-power rifle standing in the middle of the trail “hunting squirrels”. I had heard a few shots earlier while traversing the ridge.

Got the Angels Rest Hostel shuttle from the motel to the Cross Ave. trail-head, underway at 08:10. A frosty, foggy morning in Pearisburg. Climbed above the fog; near top of climb, Angels Rest view showed entire New River valley fogged in. Original plan was to stop at famous Woods Hole Hostel, 10 AT miles in (+0.5 mi down the road), but got to crossing around 13:00 so hiked on to Wapiti Shelter for the night (17.8 AT miles). Knees felt much better after the zero, despite the distance and pack heavy with 7 days food. Arrived around 16:30. Later one of the two 18-year old section hiker guys I'd been hiking around showed up (we'd been camping at the same shelters since day 18 at Laurel Cr. and they also took a zero in Pearisburg.)

Commentary:
Cold last night in shelter, despite addition of ""polar-weight"" underwear. Left shelter around 08:15. Most of the morning was fast, hiking on fairly level terrain in a deep valley following Dismal Creek. My intended destination was Jenny Knob Shelter, 14.5 mi, or perhaps a campsite beyond there near the VA-611 rd crossing, 17.6 mi. However, when I climbed to the ridge s of VA-606, about 10 mi in, where I had cell service, I had texts from Asta that our cat was seriously deteriorating and had spent the previous entire afternoon and evening at the vet and then pet ER, with another appt. on Thursday 10/25 where a decision to euthanize might likely be made. Examining my options, I could get off the AT at VA-608, Lickskillet Hollow, about 3 miles ahead, and get to the Lickskillet Hostel 0.8 mi. down the road, where I could arrange a hiker shuttle to a one-way rental car pickup to get home tomorrow.
The Lickskillet Hostel owner, trail name Mongo, is a terrific guy, with a really neat, clean, well-organized and equipped hostel in a former small church. I called him at the VA-608 crossing for a bunk. He picked me up there and offered to shuttle me to a car pickup location tomorrow morning. By evening, there were maybe eight of us, including some slack-packers Mongo was shuttling.
I reserved over the phone an Enterprise rental car for pickup in Wytheville, VA, 23 mi from the hostel, and arranged the shuttle with Mongo. The end of this section of the AT for me. When I get back on the trail, I'll be better equipped for cold weather. (Warmer quilt, higher R-value mattress, tent instead of a hammock.)
Postscripts:
1) The next morning the Wytheville Enterprise office called and informed me they did NOT have a car available. A thru-hiker at the hostel said he'd seen this happen 2 or 3 other times to fellow hikers; the small rental car offices near the AT generally don't have that much available, but the national reservation desk is oblivious. It took more than an hour and several phone calls to change the reservation to Bluefield, WV, a similar distance from the hostel but in the wrong direction from Baltimore.
2) Our cat is still ticking after the 10/25 vet appointment, with some additional meds and therapies.","Wapiti Shelter AT mi 617.6

From: 862.9 Rockfish Gap, left 07:30To: 869.4 Summit of Little Calf Mountain, arr 12:00

Stats:

AT NOBO 862.9 to 869.4, 6.5 mi, up 1774, dn 774, 7.4%Total: 13.3 mi, up 2457, dn 2457, 7.0%
Commentary:

I beefed up my gear for winter hiking: replaced hammock setup with tent; replaced inflatable pad with a closed cell pad under a higher R-value inflatable pad; added a heavy sleeping bag liner, butane stove and pot, heavier gaiters, balaclava, heavy mittens, and Micro-Spikes, and switched to waterproof shoes. Base weight climbed to 22 pounds; with 5 days of food and 1.7 liters of water, 35+ pounds. (Yikes!)  I also have a 15° F quilt on order to replace my EE “20°” quilt.

The intent today was to start a 15-day section hike NOBO from Rockfish Gap to Harpers Ferry; today I planned to hike 7.8 miles to Calf Mountain Shelter at 870.7. The south district of Skyline Drive (which the AT parallels) has been closed since the ice storm on 11/15. I had checked the ATC site for trail updates after the ice storm, but I guess too soon: the site’s 11/22 notice for SNP tells the story of what I encountered — downed trees, possibly impassable areas, etc. Lesson learned: check the site immediately before departure.

I should have gotten the hint 0.4 miles in, where the SNP self-registration kiosk had been obliterated by a large downed tree. The steel box with the permits had been sheared off and was pinned under the big end of the trunk. Beyond, the crown of the tree rested on the trail. I took the side trail (also with down trees) down to Skyline Drive and deposited my pre-filled permit at the closed entrance station up the road, then retraced to the AT and continued. Sure enough, there were numerous downed trees requiring off-trail detours and/or gymnastics to go over, under, or through. In the mature forest, the under-story was open enough to allow detours, if slow. Beyond McCormick Gap, though, is second-growth with impenetrably dense undergrowth of briars, vines, shrubs, and small trees lining the trail. Where trees were down, pulling the vines and undergrowth with it, getting through was really tough. At one point, a mat of undergrowth and small trees at least chest high blocked the trail for 25 feet, requiring a belly crawl dragging my pack behind me. I hoped things would improve in the mature forest beyond Beagle Gap, but it was worse than the climb out of Rockfish Gap, requiring more detours and slower going. At the summit of Little Calf Mountain, I had been out for 4.5 hours (including the side trip near the start and a cat-hole stop) and had covered 6.5 AT miles. Trail cleanup had not been started, and with Skyline Drive closed, there was no prospect of cleared trail ahead. I was scratched up, muddy, and worried about the abuse my pack was enduring -- snagging branches, etc. I had day-hiked this section several times and knew there were a number of problematic scrub/second growth areas ahead. With a half day of rain followed by high winds in the forecast – likely to bring down even more trees -- I decided to abort and return to Rockfish Gap via Skyline Drive. I called Asta, who was almost home by then. She decided to drive back down right away as opposed to waiting until tomorrow. Even Skyline Drive was littered with down trees; park crews had only cleared as far as McCormick Gap (3-4 miles in more than a week). SNP estimates 100 down trees per mile, which is about what I observed.

 Another hiker arrived well after dark, around 18:30, using a headlamp and accompanied by a string of f-bombs.

Commentary:
Late start. Lingered over great hot breakfast, talking with hosts Scott and Lisa, then a bit with fellow lodger looking for suggestions for hikes in SNP N district. 30s-low 40s, overcast. Tiring day. Plan was to either stop at Manassas Gap Shelter (~10 miles) or continue to Whiskey Hollow shelter depending on tiredness and time. Arrived at Manassas Gap Shelter tired but in time to continue. By Manassas Gap shelter, the hard climbs are done, so decided to continue. In particular, the climb from I-66 at Manassas Gap to the shelter of that name has a staircase profile: flattish sections alternating with usually short but steep climbs, sort of interval training.
Whiskey Hollow Shelter is new, large and impressive. A brand-new ADA-compliant (!?) moldering privy is nearby. The new access trail is not shown in Guthook or AWOL. Old trail is still there but unmarked, the old 4x4 signpost is lying on the ground. It looks like maintainers blocked the start with limbs, but someone has moved them. The new trail uses a fire road north and uphill from the old trail and the creek. The fire road parallels the creek, but well uphill. It is deeply gullied (2 ft) in parts.
Whiskey Hollow Shelter has no bear box. A bear pole is ~200 yds downhill at the older Dicks Dome shelter, which is falling apart. Decided to hang food over high beam in new shelter rather than face the round trip in the cold and dark in the morning. I was alone at shelter, as usual.","US-522 at Mtn Home Cabbin hostel, AT mi 971.1

Cold and windy overnight, maybe 20 deg. Water bottle not in quilt partially froze. Sleep system without liner worked, but was reaching limit.
Packed up and ate bars by light from valley floor and increasing light near dawn. Started hike with lightweight Capilene bottoms under pants and rain pants; polar weight sweater over normal stuff and under puffy; with balaclava, knit beanie, and puffy hood on head; and thicker gloves plus pole mitts on hands. Later, removed sweater. Unzipped and shed layers on head and hands when hot, back on when cold.
Arrived at ATC HQ before noon. Got picture taken for yearbook, and hang tag issued. Asta arrived around 13:00 to pick me up.
Lessons learned in this section:1) Bag liner too much trouble to use. (Will try wearing polar weight bottoms instead.) Even without liner, cold weather sleep system works, keeps me warm enough to at least 20 deg.2) Problem with headlamp was mostly weak battery, exacerbated by cold (determined using freezer at home). Change battery when symptoms first appear.3) Need to find way to keep fingers and hands warm when I need bare fingers to do camp tasks (like unpacking/packing pack).4) Balaclava is warm and versatile.5) In January, short day lengths limit how far I can hike each day.","David Lesser Memorial Shelter, AT mi 1015.5

Reached Tumbling Run at ~1200, too early, and Rocky Mtn Shelters ~1510, but did not relish the 0.5 mi. steeply downhill for water. Decided on Caledonia State Park, 3.4 miles farther. Park office is about 0.5 from AT, but a flat walk. Office closed at 1600, I got there 1630. Anyway, way expensive, not really for backpackers. So backtracked to the AT and pressed on 2.2 mi further to Quarry Gap Shelters. Arr 1745. Felt remarkably good, tired but not exhausted, no aches or pains.

Waded across beaver dam in Rausch Gap. And again at stream at 1182.6 — while there was a log to use as a bridge, I did not trust my balance and traction, given it was a 5 or 6 foot fall. Caught up to Zorro a couple of times. Feral was an hour back, spent time exploring Rausch Gap former village. LOTS of dayhikers/strollers out, including a group of ~20 Amish teens and smaller groups of Mennonites, mostly on the easy-walking forest road between PA-645 and PA-501. (Zorro mentioned he had encountered the Mennonites on the eastern slopes in Bolivia!)
501 shelter (hut?) an enclosed largish wooden building with a huge skylight and a wooden floor. It is pretty much a hostel without electricity or indoor plumbing. Ordered pizza etc. (for delivery!) with F and Z. Waited at 501 trailhead lot for delivery. Had pizza for dinner & breakfast. F, Z and I were the only residents.
F & Z planned a really long day (25 mi?) into Port Clinton/Hamburg. I’m planning 2 days, meeting Asta Wed. morning for resupply. So we’re splitting up after 6 days, from Toms Run Shelter to here.

Endured slow stretches of boulders in a few places, separated by long stretches fast, pleasant forest road walks. Negotiated first of two worst spots in PA for non-rock climber AT hikers: the Knife Edge (the other is N side of Lehigh Gap).
At Outerbridge Shelter, there was already one hiker present, an asshole who had set his tent up in the shelter, taking up half the shelter. Really bad trail etiquette, particularly in good (not bitter cold) weather. Later, close to dark, another SOBO backpacker arrived with good info on water situation NOBO.

Commentary:
Mild, mostly. Off & on rain in PM. Backpack off and on a ridiculous number of times. Took undershirt layers off before climb of Lehigh Gap. Stowed poles for rock climb, then retrieved after climb. Under-layers back on a couple miles later when cold wind preceded rain. Missed turn off from power line road, had to backtrack a couple of minutes. Warmed again, layers back off. Then rain jacket on and off a number of times as rain started and stopped, trying to avoid sweating up the jacket.
The grassy road walk along the mountainside, with the Superfund cleanup site out of sight above and views of Palmerton below, is really enjoyable and fast, a respite from the rock climb and bouldering that precedes it. I think the AT should keep the road walk instead of rerouting the trail along the rocky ridge as I fear they are planning. I also think the “winter alternate” blue trail and the AT should swap designations, the rock climb is too dangerous. Or at least carve a handhold or two above the toughest ledge approaching the spine.
LS shelter is old, small, low ceiling, not really set up for food prep in the rain. A lot of litter inside the shelter. Swept it into the far corner; I don’t have a extra space in my trash bag to carry it out. Had to walk down to the 2nd spring for water, as the rain began to pick up. Should have put on my rain kilt as well as my rain jacket. Pants got rather wet while sitting and filtering. I should have just filled my bottles and treated back at the shelter with Aqua Mira.

Rained hard most of night, tapering off towards morning.
In morning, got additional water at “1st spring”, now running, below shelter to carry full 2.7 liters. Access to water ahead known to be a problem; only one spring of iffy quality (a lagoon) ahead. The tap at the last shelter before DWG, Kirkridge, was reported as “off for the winter”. 
Left ~0745 after water trip. Foggy, drippy, warming. Passed Hopscotch and Deja Vu again SOBOing. May be the last time for a while, they’re taking some time off. Weather was clearing on descent into Wind Gap.
Plan was to camp near Kirkridge Shelter, then a short day Sunday into DWG, spend the night at the hostel in DWG, then zero on Monday and spend the night in a motel for Asta’s belated resupply run. 
Climbing out of Wind Gap, it was getting hotter and still humid, requiring water to drink.
To me, the most tedious part of the trail in PA is the 6 miles between the ridge just N of Wind Gap and Wolf Rocks. 6 miles of soul-crushing shark tooth rocks all standing vertically on the treadway. Cuts speed in half, requires concentration on every foot placement, and I’m still beating my feet up on rocks. You go around a bend and see yet another quarter mile of the same into the distance.
Made 2 night reservation for Sunday & Monday night at Staybridge Inn in East Stroudsburg.
Stopped at the iffy spring. Water was good enough to treat, but bits of algae would clog filter. Talked with a thruhiker doing the same section I’m doing, but SOBO. Topped off water, treating it.
At Wolf Rocks, saw a turkey buzzard standing on the ledge, at eye level, maybe 20 feet away, unconcerned by passing hikers. Got a picture.
Kirkridge shelter had a camo tarp over half the front, and two large camping chairs with trash strewn around in the other half. Didn’t see anyone inside, but suspicious.  Need ridge runners to enforce rules. Tap still gone, pipe capped. Camping sites not great. Decided to press on into DWG. AT down the mtn to DWG very wet and muddy in places.

More small ups and downs and foot bruising small rocks in AM. Spotted first snake of trip, a small ribbon garter snake.
Stopped at High Point SP HQ. Bad idea. Sign board says HP shelter closed for repairs, but nice and very helpful woman staffing HQ desk says not (why not remove sign since October?).  Fountain outside off, broke over winter; she suggested use faucet in mens room, but only bladder would fit there so she helpfully opened the janitors closet for me, to use hose for mop buckets. Found out a few minutes up the trail that the water tasted really foul, sulfury. Is it really the same water as the fountain and bathroom taps? Fortunately the first sip didn’t make me ill and was able to rinse out bottles, refill & treat at HP shelter 1.7 mi later.
N of HP shelter, as promised, the small foot-bruising rocks since Duncannon, PA finally abated and my pace improved.
“Secret Shelter”(Guthook’s quotes) is on a beautiful private property, not listed in AWOL. Acre or so of grass suitable for tenting. Well water from frost-free tap in yard. Privy.

Commentary:
Crossed out of NJ into NY for last time. Got first taste of NY pointless ups and downs (PUDs in thruhiker lingo) with irritating, hairy, hand-over-hand rock climbs and descents, but open forest floor suitable for great and much safer and enjoyable treadway visible below. It should be a hiking trail, not a rock climbing gym. Fine and safe enough until it rains, when the rocks become water slides. (Fortunately, today was clear.) Two plus miles of tedious, really slow going, with no real views as reward. Curse the sadistic NY members of the NYNJTC. Left W shelter ~0715, got to NY-17A ~ 1330, including ~45 minutes of unpacking, changing clothes, repacking in prep for doing laundry. Twice: 1st, underpants, before area likely to encounter dayhikers; 2nd, rest of duds, near (and unfortunately in sight of) NY-17A traffic. Much better to check in first, shower, then do laundry. 
Asta spent a lot of time figuring out where to stay off NY-17A, and booking a room. Warwick Valley B&B is top-notch; great rooms, great breakfast, great hostess. Decided to extend to two nights in light of rain expected tomorrow.
Got an Uber from trailhead to laundromat; did laundry, then walked to B&B. Asta overnighted a resupply to the B&B, on front porch when I arrived. Downtown Warwick is a really nice, tidy, and prosperous — lots of good dining options in easy walking distance.","Wawayanda Shelter, AT mi 1363.7

Statistics:
AT 16.3 mi, up 3879, dn 3667, 8.8% plus walk fr old 17A AT trailhead to new, and a 4? mi SNAFU around Little Dam Lake


Commentary:
My most tiring day. Rained hard overnight, stopped by morning. Very lucky to get an Uber before 0600 from B&B to trailhead. Arrived ~0615. But Google Maps & Uber show an old? AT trailhead and parking, which is a blue blazed side trail, and worse, the AT signage is still at that spot and not the new? parking area 0.1 or 0.2 farther along 17A where the AT actually crosses. Faked me out, and I had been to the new parking area 2 days earlier. So road-walked to the crossing. Two pointless climbing gym exercises before Wildcat Shelter, especially slow due to the wet rocks. At least these had blue blazed bypasses (I was tempted, but stuck to the white blazes.) From there to Harriman State Park there are a series of very rocky, steep-sided glacial? ridges 100s of feet high that need to be crossed. Very tiring, slow going.
The SNAFU was dealing with the stream crossing at 1382.8, Little Dam Lake stream crossing. Guthook comments note this crossing as dangerous and very deep after a hard rain, so I was concerned. When I reached the road crossing before there, an experienced, 60-ish dayhiker from CT asked me if I was headed for the crossing, said it looked impassible, and a “knowledgeable” local had given him detour directions around the lake, shorter than the Guthook comments detour (which involve a 2.4 mi roadwalk, missing 1.4 miles of AT). The direction started okay — we found the gated access road to the dam spillway. But, what the local thought was a bridge over the spillway turned out to be a fence preventing access to the spillway. So we ended up with a worse ford, thigh deep, in fast water over slippery rocks in the outflow below the spillway. From there it was a bushwhack back to the AT above the shore of the lake — fortunately, not too difficult. When we reached the AT, I decided to out-and-back back to the road where we started, thereby not missing any of the AT white blazes. My companion decided to follow as far as the 1382.8 stream crossing to pick up what he missed. There was a dam or log jam at the crossing, but it did not look safe to me to use, so I forded that above that, partly thigh deep but not fast moving, and hiked up to road and back. A crowd had collected by the time I got back to the stream. Someone had managed to cross on the rickety logs on the top of the log jam with barely wet feet, and people were following. A troop of SOBO Boy Scouts were crossing very slowly. one by one, and spending even more time trying to add more branches to the top to try to make it easier. It wasn’t helping, just adding stuff to trip on. They gave us a chance to cross. We crossed NOBO on the logs as well and proceeded. A couple more steep ridges remained before the bigger climbs in Harriman SP. A bit of rain and sleet now and again around this time. I slipped descending on loose gravel, landing on my butt and pack bottom. My 3rd fall since my 9/30 start. A minor fall, no pain or bruising.
At the bottom of Harriman SP, there were a zillion cars (100+?) in the access lot. My CT companion from the SNAFU and I started the climb about the same time as a group of inner city kids, ages 8? (or a small 10?) to maybe 14 and their leaders. CT eventually pulled well ahead, with a longer hike to his car. (I never did get his name.) I passed the front of the group of kids well below the “Lemon Squeezer” rock feature, but they caught up while I was trying to figure out how to get up the white blazed ledge above the squeeze. I eventually gave up and took the blue blazed “easier” bypass (not easy due to a downed tree in the middle of the boulder scramble). My first missed white blaze.


(Above the Lemon Squeezer, the trail through the rest of NY gets easier, though I didn’t know it at the time.) The kids passed me when I stopped to fill up and filter water a couple of miles before Fingerboard Shelter. I caught up with them again on the final climb up to the shelter. Most of the group had turned back at or before the Lemon Squeezer. The dozen left spanned the age range, with one older  teenage leader in charge. They were all exhausted by this point (so was I), and asked me how far they had yet to go. Assuming they would picked up at the next road crossing (they weren’t sure of the road name) I used Guthook and told them 1.6 mi, maybe an hour. I left them still resting before their final push. 


Arrived around 1730 at Fingerboard Shelter. There were probably 20 tents scattered around the tent sites around the crammed full shelter. Saturday night close to NYC. “No privy, no place to hide”. No bear boxes either, despite a notorious bear problem. Lots of campfires with sparks burning holes in tents, gear, and clothing. I pitched my tent somewhat close to the shelter, away from nearby fires, and realized later why a lot of tenters went to the most distant sites ... ahem ... closer to the edge of the woods. 


A tent stake pulled out, when I reset it and readjusted the guy lines, one of my hiking poles that I was using to support the tent buckled in the middle. wtf.  (Not fatal for the tent, I was also using the freestanding struts.)
I called Asta. She offered to drive up tomorrow with her poles, 3.5 hrs each way, not counting stops — unexpected and above and beyond. We arranged to meet at the next AT road crossing in the morning. In retrospect, I‘m sure I damaged the pole 4 days earlier, Tuesday PM, when the pole slipped between the first two bridge slats as I was lifting myself up onto a bridge. The pole buckled at about the level of the slats where it took a sharp levering force. At the time I was more concerned about my shin, which bashed the end of the bridge and really hurt. Also in retrospect, I’m lucky the pole hadn’t buckled while I was climbing or descending a rock face in the meantime.","NY-17A crossing, AT mi 1373.8

Light rain overnight, breaking camp, and off and on til early PM. Left ~0830. Met NOBO flip flopper Tortoise leaving camp. Walked down Arden Valley Road from AT crossing to Tiorati Circle to meet Asta. Exchanged poles and rain jacket, and Asta drove me back to the crossing. (ZPacks jacket needs wash to restore its waterproofing.) Tortoise mentioned he was going to Bear Mtn Inn. I had planned on a short day to West Mtn Shelter, 8.7 miles. Checked Guthook and AWOL, decided to follow Tortoise to inn. Called and made a reservation for a room. Shortly thereafter, caught up to Tortoise, mentioned I made a reservation. He had not, but now did so, but had to get a cabin, more $$$. Felt a little bad about that. Trail and treadway much better than farther south. Thousands of steep rock steps installed on AT on West and Bear Mtns, strenuous but much easier and faster than scrambles. Looks like trail crews are building rock steps working southward, passed 2 work areas. At Bear Mtn summit, lots of cars and people. Skipped climb of observation tower; thousands of rock steps is enough. Lots of tourists climbing the AT on N side of Bear Mtn. Not sure how many make it to summit and observation tower. From Hudson River to summit, trail is 4X-wide, gravel the whole way, with full-width, consistent height cut stone steps instead of slopes. Talked with a few tourists who had questions about backpacking, etc. Arrived at Inn about 1715, checked in, showered , had dinner at Inn.","Fingerboard Shelter, AT mi 1390.1

Commentary:
Had breakfast at Inn restaurant. Checked out ~0945 for zoo opening at 1000. But, a sign saying zoo closed today when approaching entrance. Unannounced. Took blue blazed bypass, not shown in Guthook, and shown incorrectly in AWOL: blue trail is not on road, it is down the embankment between the road and the zoo fence and rejoins AT at road crossing S of bridge. Zoo gate was open at AT N end, so I talked to employees just inside. Tree maintenance day, decided yesterday since weather window and no school groups scheduled. N of bridge trail is on road up the Hudson for a bit before climbing the mountain. Few blazes. And no blazes (single or double) at stone steps and no indication on signboard up the steps a bit that this is the AT, just state park info and regs. Very unusual. After continuing down up the road a bit, seeing no blazes, checked my location in Guthook with GPS, decided the steps must be the AT after all, and returned to steps. Indeed, after the steps and a turn, there was a blaze not visible from the road.


Passed Tortoise. Said he was going to Franciscan campsite not very far. Stopped at Appalachian Trail Deli, but lunchtime line too long, got a Gatorade and left. Passed ruins of George Washington’s inoculation station with plaque.


On climb to stealth campsite on ridge at S end of Fahnestock State Park, stopped for water. Could have waited, streams running most of the way to top. Good campsite for 1 2-P tent (though probably illegal) since within park boundary.","Bear Mountain Inn, AT mile 1404.5

Debbie dropped me off a bit before 0700. I descended to Guinea Brook, which was raging after yesterday’s rain. Looked like thigh or waist-deep and very fast. An info sign gave a high-water detour via roads, so I climbed back up to CT-4 and road-walked back to the AT, an additional 1.1 mi.
The day was sunny, and warm in the PM. Some road-walking, crossing the Housatonic River twice. Passed the Housatonic Valley High School at dismissal time, with lots of traffic. Passed the Great Falls (topped by a dam) on the river.The trail down to the shelter was a long 1/2 mi to the shelter, with a very steep rock staircase down a cliff next to a small waterfall in the middle of the descent. My sun hat restricts my peripheral vision, so I missed the seeing the shelter itself, despite seeing the beautiful wooded campsite: tent pads, space for many more tents, a privy, and a bear box. The shelter itself is up the hill from the campsite, hidden as you follow the access trail down. And not shown on any Guthook map, the access trail continues on down the mountain, (according to AWOL, which I checked later, to a road). Guthook’s data shows the trail ending at the shelter. I probably walked another .3 mi before it dawned on me that I might have missed it. Checking my location in Guthook, I turned around and back at the campsite, sure enough, headed uphill, the shelter is visible above and off to the side of the campsite. I got there around 1730. The shelter itself is a disappointment given the rest of the site: small, low, relatively crude, and a sleeping platform only ~7 feet deep. Plus it badly needs a new roof. I considered pitching my tent, but decided not to. Fortunately, I was alone, and was able to choose a likely dry spot in the shelter. It rained a bit in the night, and I did stay dry.","CT-4, AT mi 1480.2

Plus entering MA at beautiful Sages Ravine after Bear Mtn. The descent from Bear Mtn was hairy and wet in a few spots, with several backwards hand-over-hand descents over steep rock faces. (But less time backwards than the super-steep rock staircase descent from CT’s St. Johns Ledges.) Glad it wasn’t raining.
At the ford at the north end of Sages Ravine, passed the young couple I met at Telephone Pioneer Shelter near N end of AT in NY. (I didn’t see them at all in CT.) Hiked up and over Mt.

Tough day despite stats because of heavy rain yesterday. Cool, clear morning. Left TH Shelter ~0645. Shelter mates sleeping in, headed for resupply at Great Barrington. 

Wet feet all day, starting with submerged stepping stones. The trail across ridge to Mt Bushnell and steep descent to Housatonic valley were rocky and super slippery, slow going. Then lots of muck, flooded fields , etc. in valley. The trail on the climb and ridge on the N side of the valley were very rough, lots of boulders, steep slabs, short, steep ups and downs. I missed two sharp right-hand turns climbing in boulder fields due to lack of peripheral vision under sun hat, losing time and  backtracking. My toes were sore due to wet feet, making the hike even harder.
I decided to call it a day at the first shelter, TL, at about 1530. Soon after I arrived, a trio of hikers trickled in, two former thru hikers who SOBOed from Katadin (one a flipflop) and strongly advised I do the same after I do GA to VA. Better weather that way. They were just taking a break and headed for the next NOBO shelter, hopefully before dark, to make it easier to get to Upper Goose Pond hut tomorrow, before a rainy Friday. Water from the stream in the ravine was tannic, OK when filtered, but still a bit brown. I washed my socks and attempted to dry them in the sun, then on a line I hung in the shelter. (Still a bit damp the next morning.) I Leukotaped the persistent blister on the 4th toe of right foot, and a hot spot on the big toe of my left foot.

I had 2 days to make it to Lee, MA tomorrow (Friday) afternoon. The original plan was 2 easier days to cover the 23 miles, staying at a campsite about half way today.

Cold and cloudy most of morning; warmer, some sun in the PM. I reached the trail junction to the cabin ~1630. The sign there said cabin closed. (Guthook and AWOL say it is scheduled to open mid May, so that was a known risk.) As opposed to tenting in the rain, I called my AirBnB hostess, Pamela, who agreed to extend the stay to include tonight, and agreed to pick me up.

Up early to pack break camp before rain started. Left at 0540 in rain pants and jacket. I got the weather forecast for the planned next shelter on the phone: cold rain and snow all day, no accumulation. It started to rain during the walk through Dalton, MA; I passed tents in the backyard of a Dalton trail angel, no one stirring. The rain picked up and mixed with snow after the climb to the ridge N of Dalton. Lots of puddles on trail, slippery rocks and logs at stream crossings, and rain led to wet feet and cold hands, so I put on gloves and rain mittens. By the Crystal Mountain campsite, snow was sticking to ground. Given similar forecasts for the next few days, I decided it was time to bail and head to Georgia, 2 1/2 days before the planned end of this section in VT. I called Asta, who arranged a hotel in Pittsfield and a shuttle from Cheshire, MA.  Debbie and Joel called to offer a ride to their house later in the afternoon. (I called back later and declined.) I estimated 2.5 hours for the 3.5 miles to Cheshire. Stops for multiple phone calls and texts ate up the time. Phone rings, stop, drop poles, remove right mitten and glove (hard because polartec is sticky when wet), unfasten chest strap and unzip jacket to retrieve phone, answer phone and deal with call/texts, getting wetter and colder in the meantime; then reverse the process to get going again. (Getting the glove back on is even harder.) My wet hand and glove despite rain mitten led to a very cold right hand.

Commentary:
Flew from Baltimore to Atlanta on a 0700 flight and got a pre-arranged shuttle from Richard Anderson, from the airport to the AT trailhead at mi 1.0. Arrived Springer mi 0.0 about 1300. On the SOBO walk, observed 2 people whose had problems there: one from a bad fall, one with a turned ankle. The guy who fell had moved on by my way back NOBO; the guy with the turned ankle was still in the same place. When I asked if he was okay, he explained what had happened, got up and started to limp back to the trailhead parking area. “Not broken, I can put weight on it.”


A third guy missed the side trail and sign to the Springer Mountain Shelter and water; I gave him directions. I saw him later at the shelter; he had intended to stop at the campground 0.7 mi before the shelter, but missed the sign and trail there as well. He is relying on the AWOL profile cards to navigate the AT, not even the guidebook. I suggested he might want to get Guthook. At dinner at the shelter picnic table, I learned he was starting his thru-hike, as was one girl who had just graduated from college. Both plan to flip-flop up to Katahdin and head S at some point due to their late start.



The day was warm, no rain.When I arrived at the shelter, there were several people there. I set up my hammock nearby. Over time, more and more hikers arrived, occupying the large number of tent sites around the shelter. Among the last was 2 30s-something sisters with a bunch of kids. One sister had thru-hiked with her kids (!) a couple of years ago. The kids were noisy well after hiker midnight (2100) but the long, long day that started in Baltimore allowed me to sleep regardless.","Springer Mtn, GA, AT mi 0.0

Commentary:
I got up around 0445, planning to be off by 0600. In MA, there was plenty of light for hiking by 0530. In GA, at 0600, it was still pretty dark, barely light enough to hike without a headlamp to see the treadway. A lot farther south and west, I guess.


Another warm day, no rain.


My plan was a 15.9 mi day to the Lance Creek tent site. I got there ~1400 and it was full already, and not a very nice spot. It looked like the forest service had turned a gravel road into a campsite: no shade, heavy underbrush on the edges, no privacy between tent sites, dusty, no trees to pitch a hammock. I considered going SOBO a bit back to a couple of sites but decided to press onward instead. The reason Lance Creek was full is that it’s the last formal site before a 5 mi stretch closed to camping until June 1 unless you carry a bear canister (which I do) so hikers tend to pile up on either side of the closure.


Before Jarrard Gap (the S end of the closure) where the trail sidecuts a steep slope, I passed a mother bear and her cub 20 yds up the slope. They took off farther up the hill.


I stopped at the first shelter in the closed area, Woods Hole, a long 0.4 off the AT, at ~1600. It is on a beautiful, if isolated, side ridge. The  shelter was empty and very clean. Not many visitors, I guess — too far off the AT for a lunch  stop, particularly with the Blood Mtn summit and its views just 1.3 mi ahead. I spent the night alone, in the shelter. No bears.","Hawk Mtn Shelter, AT mi 8.1

Commentary:
Summited Blood Mtn in the morning with no views, just fog. Stopped in Neel Gap at Mountain Crossings outfitter (the AT runs through their breezeway) and bought a small pack towel to replace the one I didn’t see when I packed before leaving Balt. 



The day was warm. In Tesnatee Gap, got my first trail magic. A father & middle-school son were serving water, sodas, bananas, apples, and oranges. I had a 0.5L ice-cold water and a banana. I met two other hikers already there, a father and college-age son. Father had an old-school outside frame pack (very much like the one I had in high school); son had a huge army desert camo rucksack (turns out he’s in ROTC). With others present, the hiker father did almost all of the talking; on the trail (and later in camp) the son talked continuously to his father or on the phone to his girlfriend. You knew they were there whenever they were in earshot.In the afternoon, had a bit light rain off and on, barely enough to justify digging out rain gear, particularly given how warm it was.


Arrived at Low Gap shelter ~1545. The shelter area has several big blow-downs making the trail a bit tricky to follow and requiring detours through tent sites. A couple of people were on tent sites along the trail, but I was first at the shelter, and decided to stay in the shelter. Later father and ROTC son were heard and then showed up. They tented farther down the creek. A bit later two 40s-ish women arrived, exhausted, and also chose the shelter. They met on a Facebook group for hikers and teamed up (with one other lady who dropped out the second day) to do the GA section of the AT. They’re from FL, so no place to train for the climbs. One of the women had not been able to keep any food down since Springer (she surmised altitude sickness?) so things are getting desperate. They are planning a zero day in town after tomorrow.","Woods Hole Shelter, AT mi 27.7

Left LG shelter ~0700. Day clear and warm. Lots of hikers waiting for rides at Unicoi Gap. Good view from Tray Mtn summit ~1415. There I met a group of thru hikers headed for the next shelter N of Tray Mtn Shelter. Given the time, I would have too, but did not want to get too close to tomorrow’s destination, Dicks Creek Gap and a reservation at the Holiday Inn in Hiawassee, GA for resupply.


Arr TM shelter ~1430. A number of tent sites were already occupied. I chose a smallish site about 100 yds up the trail from the shelter and set up my hammock. While prepping dinner in front of the hammock a lizard (skink?) with stripes along its 5” back and a surprisingly short tail scampered out of the bushes, sat for a moment, then scampered across the clearing into the bushes on the other side.


Around 2045, shortly before hiker midnight, I was already zipped in the hammock, when a family with a couple of young kids arrived. The mother had a really loud voice. Apparently they parked at the forest road crossing just 1.3 mi down the mtn. They almost decided to camp next to my site, encroaching on the tenters who had set up on the far edge of that site. Someone thankfully convinced them there were better sites beyond the shelter, and they moved on, having made sure everyone knew they’d arrived.","Low Gap Shelter, AT mi 42.8

Commentary:
Left ~0730. Per AWOL, called at the top of Powell Mtn ~1100 to arrange a shuttle to Hiawassee from Dicks Creek Gap with a pickup at 1300. The most local guy, Affordable Taxi, said he was booked until at least 1500 and declined. I called a few other shuttles, no answer. I tried Affordable again, no answer. I was resigned to hitchhike the 11 mi into Hiawassee. Part way down the mountain, I checked my phone and still had signal. I tried Affordable again, got thru, and agreed to wait. I sat in the shade for quite a while in the gap, and Affordable Taxi showed up. On the way into town, i arranged for him to pick me up in the morning to get back to the AT. I got to the Holiday Inn at 1500, checkin time. I retrieved my box, showered, did laundry, ate at Daniel’s Steakhouse across the street, packed provisions, etc.


Lesson learned: always arrange transportation when you make a reservation. Estimate when you’ll be at the trailhead for pickup, and arrange for the return as well.","Tray Mtn Shelter, AT mi 58.2

Shuttle dropped me off about 0745. Clear, warm, breezy. Hiked into NC; climb out of Bly Gap long and steep. Noticed that there is no poison ivy along the AT in this section of the AT, whereas on the GA side of the border it was rampant. (Found out later the maintaining club patrols for it and pulls it all up — mechanical means, not chemical.) Unfortunately, in many places, the trail in NC is overgrown with other understory plants.


Met older guys Robert & Darrell at SI shelter. Darrell is a retired AF and airline pilot, 69, very outgoing, doing an AT section hike to Fontana. He has done a number of sections, including Katahdin and 100-mile wilderness, and the Presidential range in NH. Robert, early 60s, is sort of paralleling/following the AT with a loosely defined northbound itinerary on a vacation jaunt.

Another clear, warm day. Stopped at Standing Indian Mtn summit; the views were just as good on the way up. Darrell planned to hike to LB shelter as well; he passed me while I was making a phone call on the ridge; I caught up later while he and another hiker who passed me (Erica, 30, Dr. doing residency) were having lunch. The three of us stayed fairly close, including a stop for water, to the summit of Mt Albert, where a historic fire tower stands. The final ascent was very steep, hand-over-hand in places. Great views, with a picture naming the peaks. Darrell & I continued to LB shelter, Erica to her car parked near the summit. (There’s a road up to there, and a number of people sightseeing.)


At the shelter, another old folks home. Tim, around 60, was there. He and Darrell, both being retired military, talked for quite a while. Younger folks tented around the shelter. The three of us slept in the shelter.","Standing Indian Shelter, AT mi 85.9

The climb was hot, without shade for much of the way — but some nice views. Plus a continual stream (100?) of day-hiking tourists doing a loop hike back down to the Clingmans Dome parking lot. At the summit, I decided to bypass the crowds (1000s? based on the noise) at the observation tower and stuck to the AT past the zoo. The last obstacle after Clingmans Dome is a 500 ft, 0.9 mi climb to the Mt Collins summit. I was spent; it was a long climb.

Commentary:Larry fed me a huge breakfast which kept me going all day. Left the hostel about 0730 after getting some of his life story. Good hiking today despite the climbs.
At LM shelter, about 1730, “thru-hiker” Mechanic rolled in with his big, but too thin, dog. He spent an hour building a fire to pan fry burgers with all the trimmings he packed out of Damascus. His gear included a hatchet for firewood and a frying pan; 60 pounds, plus what the dog was carrying. Talking with him, he seems to be sort of thru-hiking, skipping sections along the way (including the Smokies, because of the dog). He ended up tenting near the shelter.","Damascus VA, AT mi 471.0

Commentary:

Overall, a tough day hiking. Second half of the day around Mt. Rogers and down thru the Grayson Highlands was rough trail, slow going:,around Mt. Rogers, rocky, rooty, very wet trail with short, steep climbs & descents which the stats don’t capture. The Grayson Highlands, which I had been looking forward to, were a bit disappointing. The views from the southern balds were much better. Half the time in the GH, the trail was a rubble-filled ditch surrounded by scrub, which means no shade and no view at all. Pony trails leading off in all directions and erratic AT blazes made the AT hard to follow. Ponies also mean lots of pony poop and flies, lots of flies, and polluted streams. Sections of the trail through the GH were also very rocky, requiring use of hands on the descents and more slow going.



I arrived at Wise Shelter around 4:15 to find lots of people. Fortunately, only three of us stayed in the shelter. In the evening, a series of thunderstorms hit, with torrential rains and some wind. For the most part, we stayed dry in the shelter. I took advantage of a rain-free lull to stow my canister in the bear box, a bit of a hike. About 1900 in the middle of the downpours 3 soaked hikers came in and debated whether to stay or continue 2 mi mostly uphill back to their car. Eventually, they continued.","Lost Mountain Shelter, AT mi 486.6

Commentary:I had slept with my hand sanitizer bottle because of the rain and the distance between the bear box, the shelter, and the privy. It leaked and an edge my quilt got soaked. One older guy who tented near W shelter said he was up violently ill all night with Noro-like symptoms. Yikes. (No spread to me 48 hrs later.) Was probably bad water, given all the pony poop.Rain had gone but it was overcast and windy. Despite a wrong turn which took me up Wilson Creek trail for 15 minutes, which I then retraced, overall it was a much easier day with better footing.Lucky, a 40s-something section hiker, also stayed at Trimpi shelter.","Wise Shelter, AT mi 504.1

At Partnership Shelter, saw “Mechanic” and his dog again who tented at Lost Mtn Shelter with me. Apparently, he skipped a bunch of trail and shuttled north.","Trimpi Shelter, AT mi 524.2

Observations on south 600 miles:1. Tent would have worked as well as hammock. Good tent spots everywhere in south 600 mi.2.
