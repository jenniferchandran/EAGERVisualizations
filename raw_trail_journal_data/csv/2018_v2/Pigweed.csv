Pigweed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582413,"In July my friend Greg Grant and I went to Washington State to hiked up and on to Mount Adams. You can see from this photo that Mount Adams is gorgeous. The following day the view from behind this position of the photographer revealed Mount Saint Helens and Mount Rainier in all their Glory. Beautiful. This was the inaugural first backpacking trip of my Duplex tent. It worked out wonderfully and I am happy to say I am pleased with this tent in every respect. It is light but durable and pitches easily, I can’t wait to try it on the Appalachian Trail. I keep vacillating back and forth between planning on using this tent and my Hennessy Hammock system. The advantages of the tent are that it is lighter, and it also will allow me to easily do my morning stretches that are important to keep my back functioning. The disadvantage of any tent is that it needs a flat rock free spot. While the advantage of the hammock system is I can pitch it anywhere because there are trees everywhere on the Appalachian Trail. At this point my plan is to start with the tent because it will be fairly cold at the beginning and then at some point probably swap out for the hammock. The only thing that makes me reconsider this decision is that the beginning of the hike will be the most crowded and potentially where the highest degree of difficulty would be found in getting a spot for the tent?",,"Mt Adams, Washington State ","Jul 07, Fri",7
Pigweed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581847,•	During the last week of September we did a week-long hike in Medicine Bow Wyoming. This turned out to be a little too wintery for our case.  Snowed significantly. One of our team had a rotten tooth so we abandoned mid-week.

Pigweed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582252,In October my friend Bill Bartz and I did a weekend hike in Harriman State Park in lower New York. We parked at the Northern end of Harriman on Rt 6 which is right below West Point. From there we hiked South about 8 or 9 miles on the MY Long Trail.  The following day we hiked North along the Appalachian Trail back to & beyond our car. There’s a monument right at the border of West Point called Torrey Memorial.  If one hikes beyond and over the monument there is excellent Camp spots to be had.   The monument affords above Tree Line 180° views looking directly onto Bear Mountain. On some weekends I have camped here and been awakened by artillery and helicopters flying around it is that close to the southwest corner of West Point. The picture shows me standing in front of a Hut on the AT that is on a massive rock monolith.  Cave shelter and hippo Rock are also identifiable locations on this part of the Long Path.,,Harriman and Long Trail loop,"Oct 20, Fri",20
Pigweed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582192,"Today I went for a hike in White Clay Creek State Parks in the rain because I wanted to test my trekking umbrella. I first read about trekking umbrellas on Bigfoots YouTube site when he reviewed it while doing a John Muir trail hike.  It rained mostly vertically with some occasional gusts but certainly not a sideways blow. I wore my outdoor research lightweight raincoat with the hood down the entire time. I also had my zipper down to about mid chest level. This is a normal hike I do as a training, it is about 3.5 miles.I'm pleased to report that this system worked quite well. The pack and my head were quite well covered.  The system seems to have several advantages. The ventilation with the umbrella is vastly superior to having the hood up on any rain coat. There's also no rain water running down the back of your coat between your pack and your raincoat. While the weather today was relatively warm at almost 60 degrees, so quite comfortable for hiking, I think it safe to say that this is a much cooler method of rain protection.  The umbrella is black on the bottom and white on the top.  This will a allow it to be used in above tree line hiking for some protection and in desert conditions. I believe the use of a light rain skirt will make this system perfect.EuroSCHIRM Swing Liteflex Umbrella Silver U",,"White Clay Creek State Park, Delaware ","Jan 13, Sat",3.50

Finishing my last days of work have been interesting with global friends that have come together in the US for a global alignment meeting.   They gave me many nice trail related gifts and wrote me a nice poem.  My Delaware based colleges had a luncheon and a cake imprinted with a pic of me backpacking. My wife and  daughter had an AT symbol placed on a cake at a dinner with my  life long friends.Logistics for transportation to the trail involved flying to Charleston South Carolina where my wife picked me up and we stayed with her parents. We had a very nice dinner with them and the Oyer family on Friday night.We then drove to Atlanta hooking up with my friends Vernon and Lois Clark at their house with Greg Grant where we had a last weekend party with them over Saturday and Sunday. Greg and I were them delivered to the beginning of our adventure at Amnicola Falls State Park by my wife Cindy on Monday and were on the approach trail at 10:15 am am Feb 26th.  I am humbled by the support and good wishes of so many.

We said our goodbyes and started from the top of the falls, hiking the 8th mile approach trail to the beginning of Springer Mnt  Georgia. Over 30 thru hikers signed in today for the hike. The bubble of people starts now and will build through March. Approach trail had some steep moments and we worked up a sweat but not too bad. We set up camp tonight at the Springer Mountain shelter, tenting near a good water source. There were lots of folks milling about the hut to chat with. Temp as I went to bed at 10 o'clock was 39.  Tomorrow it's forecasted to be a nice sunny day then Wednesday and Thursday quite rainy.

Pigweed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583495,"Our first day on the trail was hiked after Tent camping at Springer Mnt. Shelter. We intended to go only 8 miles to Hawk Mnt but decided to push on because the day was blue bird nice and the next two days are rain. The problem with pushing past Hawks Mnt is that there is no water for 6 miles.  We knew that we were not good for 14.5 today so pushing on meant carting enough water for a dry camp’s dinner, breakfast and 4 miles tomorrow. I carried 5 liters for the last 2.5 miles. There were two hard climbs that left us camping for the night in Horse Gap at the 10.5 mile mark. Tomorrow we will wake to rain and a 650 ft climb in a mile to get over Sasafras Mnt. We are considering trying to get a shuttle in 10 miles tomorrow at Woody Gap to get to a town or hostel to take a zero Thursday and wait out the second day of the storm.  Failing that we will need to do two 10 mile days in the rain from here to get to Neels Gap where we have Greg's car waiting. So a bit more than I hoped on the first (second day after the approach trail) day, but great weather.  We met and camped tonight with Pendulum.

It consists of a trekking umbrella, a rain Kilt, and a raincoat.  Behind me you can see hiker Pendulum under his tarp after having taken down his hammock. We easily hiked up Sassafras Mountain down and up another Mountain. After about 5.5 miles of steady rain we got to Gooch Gap shelter. We had lunch there with other hikers and found a shuttle driver that could meet us up the trail at Gooch Gap. Fortunately we had cell service to call around to find a shuttle driver.  We decided that we would get out of the storm and have a Nero for today, and a Zero tomorrow on Thursday. Apparently many other hikers did so as well because when we got to the town of Dalonega Georgia there are hikers all over the place.  We got some Mexican food and some beers and dried and cleaned our gear and clothes in the hotel room.

We got to Lance camp area by 12:30 and had lunch.  Bagel with peanut butter and peanut m&ms.  Because the area ahead has a required bear canister to camp over night we had to stop at 7.5 or go all the way to 15 miles today and up to Neels Gap.  I was tempted but my plan was to stay under 10 miles for a while to ease into it.Greg and I are  camped with 4 other guys with tents crammed close on the valuable flat real estate.  We had a nice time chatting and cooking dinners together.  Pyro, Dave, Steve, and Charles who I just named Alamo because he is from San Antonio. We climb over Blood Mnt tomorrow for the highest spot on the Georgia AT section at around 4500, from our camp at 2800.","Gooch Gap

Feet. Just one small blister on a “ring finger” toe that always wants to get pinched by its neighbor toe. Fine after all this time of hiking on it.2. Ankle/Achilles.  My current problem.  Strange, as ankles have never been my problem.  I hiked for years in sandals with full backpack weight.  This should not be a hike ending injury it just requires patience and time to let it heal. I have time.3. Knees. Holding up well so far with mild soreness especially on big descending days.4. Hips.  My right hip is an indicator of my back causing a nerve pinch. I do a standing stretch on the trail as soon as I feel any of this and that seems to be working so far.  5. BACK. This is the big one for me and my potential hike ending issue if I don’t keep it straight. I have two bulging discs in my lower back that are kept under control with the hip belt from the pack and a religious dedication to stretching it morning and night and also standing stretches during the day when I feel the hip pinch. So far so good. Thanks Dr. Lodus for the years of chiropractic care to get me to this point.6. Weight.  If the scale here at the hostel is to be believed I’ve lost 10 lbs in 20 days and a hundred fifty miles.

Smokie Mnt national park has rules that require camping by the shelters or designated tent spots.  I wimped out of stealth  camping when I saw the signs and heard the story of bears knocking down tents with campers in them at night at this site.  The damaged tent is still there with sign that says there is some bear monitor inside?Unfortunately this meant doing 12 miles on the first day.  Not how I planned to start slowly on my ankle!  I hammocked outside of Mollies Ridge shelter.  The weather was very nice and it was a nice hike.  Ankle was happy with it.

This is the major event of the hiking season with a massive three day party, a hiking parade with people dressed up in silly costumes, a prom for prior hiking classes and a talent show. Also many equipment vendors have booths and displays which I took advantage of to buy some storage pods for food from Hyperlite Co.  I even hiked in the hiker parade with the other hiker trash, lots of fun. (Can anyone find me on a video? Hundreds of people videoed it so there is likely evidence somewhere) Lots of free food with the local churches and charities putting on hiker feeds. It was a bit of a crazy mud bowl in the woods where the hard core parties happened. So I elected to camp in the field section.  It rained both evenings.On Sunday I woke up to get myself back north to my spot on the trail. First I exchanged some unpleasantries with some giy that had a rooster that woke everyone at 530 am.

Pigweed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591323,"This morning I woke to exit the shelter which is near the Mount Rogers visitor center to find a nice blue sky day. The day went from Pleasant blue skies to thunderstorms somewhere around mid morning. Going over a 4,000 peak my umbrella became unhappy in the thick rhododendron tunnel area. Fortunately most of the thunderstorms and heavy rain were over at that point so I hiked without it down into the valley. The valley that the trail followed was a deep V gap and the heavy rains from the thunderstorms made the River that it followed swell. Unfortunately the trail crossed this river multiple times and provided for sketchy crossing in what would normally have been an easy hike. After the trail exiting this valley it went through a series of quite muddy hiking areas.  Along the way I came to a one room schoolhouse that the local ministries keep stocked with trail magic for hikers. I’d seen this on videos doing research for this trip so it was kind of an interesting stop over. See pics. I came into the town of Adkins VA after about 11 miles checked into the relax Inn (which is a dive) and cleaned up. I’ll get new shoes at the post office tomorrow and resupply for the 48 miles to Bland VA.  Unfortunately this is a linear valley town and the post office is 3.5 miles away.  I’ll hitch. My mileage is off I realize by about 20 miles too high on Trail Journals.  Somewhere I must have double entered something. It is easy to do so.

Lunched at the top and covered several sub peaks of Carter before the brutal climb down which involved a fair amount of hand-over-hand climbing over sketchy wet rocks. After eight miles we arrived at IMP Campground where it costs 10 for a wooden platform to pitch your tent on the side of the mnt.Tomorrow we race the rain into town, but need to get up and down mnt Moriah. I will zero in town for a while and try to heal up my foot. Mnt Madison and Washington are next and my foot is in bad shape.","Wildcat Mountain

Pigweed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601001,"We left IMP camp and walked the 8 miles up and over Mnt Moriah to the intersection of Route 2 to the west of Gorham. Stayed in Rattle River Hostel Friday the 17th.  They were full after this so I moved down the road to White Birches Campground. I’m staying in an old barn on the top floor that is converted to a comfy bunkhouse. The people are nice and it’s only $15 a day. So this is a good spot to rest my foot which I will do for several days planning to get back on the trail after the Wednesday rain. I have new boots being delivered (hopefully) 25 miles down the trail from Pinkham Notch at the Highland Visitor Center. We’ll see how my foot responds to the hike up and over Madison, Washington and several other Peaks on that 25 miles to the visitor center.","IMP camp

Pigweed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601770,After a week of zeroing in Gorham NH I decided to get back on trail and see how my foot tolerates the hiking in my new Vasque boots. I spent most of the day getting a rental car picking up my shoes from 25 miles away at the Highland  Center then going back to Gorham return the car and hitching a ride to Pinkham Notch. So after getting on trail about 5 I raced the darkness to hike 5 miles to Osgood tent site. This site is at the base of the climb of Mount Madison that will leave me to Mount Washington tomorrow. I don’t have High Hopes based on how my foot feels that it will go well but I’m going to make it to the top of Mount Washington.,"Pinkham Notch Visitor Center

Pigweed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601771,"Climbed Mnt Madison and up the ridgeline to Mnt Washington.  Here my journey comes to an end I'm afraid.  My foot is still unhappy even after spending a week of zeroing in Gorham and getting new boots. So I will hitchhike off of Mount Washington and work my way back home to get some treatment for plantar fasciitis. My research tells me this is not a quick recovery so I am pessimistic about completion of the AT at this point. Mount Washington with its pay road to the top and cog railroad is a tourist attraction. Kind of interesting at over 6,000 feet.  The weather was good so I took lots of pictures and had an easy time hitching a ride back down.Indeed I did make it home by bus and train after camping near Pinkham Notch Visitor Center to catch the morning bus. I’m working on my plantar fasciitis with the podiatrist. I hope to get on the trail and meet up with some of my hiking flip flop friends in the south, but the north end will likely close down before I am trail ready again.","Osgood tent site
