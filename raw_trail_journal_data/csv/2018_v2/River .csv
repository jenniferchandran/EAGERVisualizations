River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586164,"I'm trying to get more familiar with navigating this forum.  My original entry indicated that I would be doing a NOBO hike starting the beginning of April.  I have decided to complete a ""flip flop"" starting from Harpers Ferry.  I'll spend the last weekend of April attending the ""Flip Flop Festival"" and start hiking north on May 1st.  I'm finishing up food prep and logistics, and trying to make sure everything is ready to go on the home front for my 6 months away.  I'm a little nervous, but I have a great support network, and can't wait to get started.",,View Entry,"Apr 09, Mon",0
River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587121,"I'm 10 days out from leaving Michigan and heading to Harpers Ferry.  As the day draws closer, I am vacillating between so many emotions and feelings...excitement, nervousness, anxiety, calm, anticipation.  I am also experiencing what I'm sure many people preparing for a thru hike (especially their first one) do - organized chaos. I've had tables set up with food and gear EVERYWHERE!  I also suffer from ""shiny object"" syndrome, sometimes abandoning a task before its completion, to start another task, prompted by seeing an object, or a random thought that pops into my head.  I move things to a different location, thinking it will help me be more organized.  Despite all this, it's coming together.  Making plans to be gone from home for 6 months is difficult.  I am trying to anticipate any needs, or any upcoming issues that will need to be addressed at home while I am gone.  I had the furnace and hot water heater replaced recently, and hoping for a break in the weather to clean the gutters.  Having retired in October, there are lots of house projects to be done, many of which will have to wait until I return. As far as the trail goes, I should have what I need, and will make adjustments as I go.",,View Entry,"Apr 17, Tue",0
River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587837,"Up to this point I have used my computer for my journal entries. I thought I would practice with my phone, since that will be the device I will utilize throughout my hike. I am somewhat technologically challenged and don’t like using my phone for anything other than phone calls, text messages skimming emails, and playing candy crush. I don't do any social media, so this journal is my first ""social media"" account.  
I thought I would go all out with my practice phone entry and add photos.  I attempted to load photos, but it didn’t work. I did some research and found out that I needed a photo uploader. I downloaded it and uploaded photos, but now trying to figure out how to move and edit them, and do a journal entry to  coincide, so this is my first journal entry with my phone...without photos.  I’ll try to figure the photo thing out later. The good thing is I can use voice recording for my entries! Big bonus for me since I dislike typing on my phone.  I’m now three days out from leaving. I’m looking forward to the festival this coming weekend!  Any elementary children  out there for hire to do my journal entries and photos?  LOL!",,View Entry,"Apr 24, Tue",0
River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587843,"A lot of people ask me about my food on the trail.  I use a combination of different food options, but my dinners are primarily freezer bag cooking of homemade meals.  I like to have food that I would normally eat at home, with the same flavor.  The best way to do that is to actually cook the meal, then dehydrate it. It doesn't look anything like it would at home (it's usually a brownish powder), but the taste is just like home cooked.  Not all my dinners are brown powder.  I also utilize some pre-packaged foods which I use in combination with other foods.  For example, I use quinoa and brown rice packets (thanks for tip on one of your favorites, Ayden!) which I heat in the microwave, the add canned chicken, which I've dehydrated, to make a meal. See my photos labeled ""food prep"" for a visual of the process. Breakfast will typically consist of combinations of chia seeds, oatmeal, dried fruit, and nuts. Lunches and snacks will be a variety of items such as hummus (dehydrated and reconstituted on the trail) and tortillas, beef jerky, cheese, snack bars, and other snack items.  I will also be adding olive oil and coconut oil to a lot of my food for the added calories.  Bon appetite!",,View Entry,"Apr 24, Tue",0

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588634,"I'm leaving today.  I spent the morning at the ATC HQ yesterday meeting thru hikers coming in from GA.  As they came in and set their packs down in front of the ATC, I couldn't help but notice how ""streamlined"" and organized they were.  My pack doesn't look like that...yet.  They were very encouraging and said their packs were not that efficient when they started.  As you hike, you figure out what you don't need, and send it home, or put it in a hiker box for someone else.  I'm getting a late start today, as my morning didn't go exactly as planned, but that's ok.  I don't like rushing around, so I got a cup of coffee and went with the flow.  It's a beautiful sunny day in the mid to upper 70's. The heat is coming the next 3 days - upper 80's to 90 degrees.  Thanks to everyone for all your messages and encouragement.  It is greatly appreciated. 
I'm off - headed north!",,View Entry,"May 01, Tue",0
River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588932,"Today was the first day. Before leaving ATC HQ in Harpers Ferry, I met Balto heading SOBO (Southbound), Ulysses heading NOBO (Northbound), and Wind Eagle (NOBO). The weather was absolutely beautiful. Coming out of Harpers Ferry, the Appalachian Trail is the C&O (Chesapeake & Ohio Canal) Towpath. It is a beautiful walk along the river. After getting lulled into complacency, I then hit “the trail”. There’s about 1000 foot ascent after getting off the tow path. I’m in decent physical condition, however getting in backpacking shape is very different. At the end of the day, my deep hip muscles felt like I had laid on my side and did 1000 leg lifts. Getting to camp was a relief, until I had to go get water. The shelter and campsites were at the top of a ridge....the water was at the bottom. It was a very deep descent with switchbacks, and of course, once I went down, i had to go back up. It took me 54 minutes to get my water, when all I wanted to do was relax for a minute. No time for that. Once I got my water I had to set up camp, eat my dinner and hang my bear bag.  Luckily there was a bear pole for the bags and I didn’t have to hang it from a tree.   I’m not gonna lie. It was a rough first day. It was very nice guys from Cleveland at the campsite along with Field Trip,  ulysses, and the Canadians, very nice couple from Toronto Canada. The Canadians don’t have trail names yet. I will do my best to keep my journal up-to-date, but with limited battery life I may have to catch it up when I get to locations with the electricity.","Harpers Ferry, WV

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589411,"The day started off well.  I'm a little sore, but the trail was nice and soft the first half of the day. I noticed on the easier parts of the trail, I get a ""cadence"" going and develop a rhythm with the trail. It motivates me to keep going. I'm not sure if that's unique to me, I suspect other hikers have the same type of experience.  The afternoon brought on rocks. These are not like stones in a driveway that are easy to walk on.  My best description of them is that a dump truck 3/4 full of rocks ranging from 2 inches to 2 feet, and 1/4 full of dirt, drove down the trail, dumping its load. The rocks are at all sorts of odd angles, and there's very little dirt to step on.  As carefully as I tried to step, my feet turned every which way in my boots. I think because the rocks in Pennsylvania are so much more challenging, and go on for much longer (I wouldn't know from experience since I haven't hiked there yet), no one talks about the rocks in Maryland.  I just look at it as a training ground for what's to come, but it was sure nice to get to camp and put my feet in a cold stream.  It was another tough day, but the sunset made it totally worth it.The three gentlemen from Cleveland, the Canadians, and Field Trip stayed at Rocky Run.  Slept in my tent - it was hot, tomorrow will be hotter.  During the day I met Ex-FedEx, Ferrell Dad, Sawdust (who knew what kind of tree had 7 trunks - see photos), and Taxman.","Ed Garvey Shelter
",Rocky Run Shelter,"May 02, Wed",9.10
River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589413,"Today was a very hot day - unseasonably hot. The normal average temperature is in the 70's, it was 88 degrees in the shade. The trail was very nice coming out of Rocky Run.  I got a later start than I wanted.  I woke up at 5:30, then promptly fell asleep until 6:50!  Not my normal time to get up. At home, I am at the gym at 5am... speaking of which...A shout out to my CrossFit family at Light The Fire Crossfit in Monroe! I've been training there since October 2015 and feel I have a good base of strength to work from for this journey. Thanks to the 5am crew for the nice send off and thoughtful gifts (that don't weigh a lot) after my last workout before leaving town. You are the best! I also sprinkled in a bit of Bikram yoga for my physical preparation.Anyway...getting up late is not good when it's going to be hot. Add in the fact that I'm still in ""organizing"" mode, since I didn't do a ""shake down"" hike adds to the slowness in getting ready in the morning. Efficiency is about simplicity, and having a system.  Everyone has their own system, and everyone has to figure out what system works for them. Some people organize gear by stuff sacks, some simply stuff items into their packs to fill spaces, food is organized different ways - by day, by meal ect.  I have talked to other hikers and it's the same for most people, constantly reworking their system. Even some of the hikers who have come 1,000 miles from Georgia say they are still working on their system.  Part of the organizing is figuring out what you need and don't need, sending the things you don't need home. It's took much weight. Things have to be put where they make sense, then you have to remember where you put it!  So needless to say, I am organizing while I am packing, which slows me down.After taking off from Rocky Run, I had a 1.8 mile hike to Dahlgren Back Pack Campground, where there was running water, and free showers! It was hot...I took full advantage of the shower, soaked my shirt in cold water, and got back on the trail.  Nice!  Hard Knocks came into the campground just before I left.  He started hiking in Georgia in January.  Wind Eagle also came in.  She was waiting for delivery of a supply box that someone was bringing in. It was another 1.8 miles to Washington Monument State Park where I came across the Canadians sitting under a shade tree.  It was sometime around noon, and the heat was brutal, especially carrying a backpack.  We all sat under a tree for the entire afternoon.  They took off about an hour before me, and I starting hiking after 4 1/2 hours. After leaving the park area, the trail led up to the original Washington Monument.  Along the well groomed trail were signs with milestones of George Washington's life.  It was a really neat walk for me, especially considering my admiration of George Washington as a leader, having not taken the offer of being a king, opting for democracy.  What would our country be like if he had chosen to be king?I took a photo of the monument from the trail.  I really wanted to go look at it, but I was so beat down by the heat, even after sitting all afternoon, I couldn't muster up enough gumption to walk up there. Besides, I can drive to the park and go see it another time when I can really take the time to enjoy it - add it to the life list...","Rocky Run Shelter
",Pine Knob Shelter,"May 03, Thu",7.50
River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589427,"This was my fourth day of hiking.  I felt pretty good today.  It was overcast and cooler out. I got out late again, but managed to go 13.1 miles. Hard Knocks got up very early as he was planning to do 22 miles today. The hikers from Georgia are like gazelles on the trail.  They have 1,000 miles under their feet and glide along, while those of us just starting seem to trudge along.  It will come with time and patience.  The trail continues to train us, giving us what we need.
Coming out of the shelter area, there was a steady climb with rocks - a good warm up for the legs.  My hip muscles aren't as sore, it is now moving to my glutes, which are getting quite a workout. Lots of rocks throughout the morning and early afternoon. I came across a day hiker who had stopped and pointed out a snake in a tree! It was an interesting sight. Another day hiker, Chuck, came up behind us and stopped.  After taking photos and moving on, Chuck and I struck up a conversation, which led to his offer of a ride when I came off trail.  My first Trail Angel!  I have a photo of Chuck in my photos, with a description of what a ""trail angel' is. It is part of the amazing culture of the trail which drew me to want to hike it.  I stopped at Black Rock Cliffs, overlooking Hagerstown (MD), took off my boots and had lunch.  In the afternoon, I caught up with the Canadians. We had some rough ups and downs today.  In the afternoon we found a nice cold stream to get water, and soak our feet. They are such a pleasure to hang out with.  Young love...they have fun, and make each other laugh, which I believe, is the most important thing for a long and happy relationship.  We also ran into Pocket Dock and Snugs, who are NOBO from Georgia.
I headed off to Raven Rocks Shelter, and they took a food break at Ensign Cowall Shelter. I had a nice hike through the woods which opened into a meadow.  I saw deer just before coming out of the woods.  It was a very pleasant walk through a couple of meadows, then through another woods, and a steep down to a creek.  After crossing Antietam Creek, I hit the hardest part of my day, a steep 600' elevation climb.  600' up doesn't seem like much, unless it's steep.  I trudged along, my steps barely longer than a boot length, for about 35 minutes, steadily going up.  I haven't mentioned it yet, but I hike with a very light umbrella, attached to my shoulder strap. So far, it has been my best piece of gear.  Since there are no leaves on the trees yet, it has kept the sun off me, and this particular afternoon, it kept the rain off me. 
As I ascended, I was using my umbrella for the rain. There was a large boulder I was navigating up, as the trail took a sharp left turn. To my right was a 15' drop off.  As I was coming up the boulder, a gust of wind caught the umbrella at the moment I had the least amount of stability.  It caused me to lose my balance to the right, and I fell to the boulder, landing on my knees and grasping the boulder with my hands. Whew!  No more umbrella today!
I made it into camp late. There were several hikers.  I can't remember everyone's name, but I was greeted by Wingnut and Phaedrus, thru hikers in 2014.  I was very excited to meet them.  I read their journals in 2014 while they were doing their hike. Thumper joined us and we stayed up late chatting. They were a wealth of information.","Pine Knob Shelter
",Raven Rocks Shelter,"May 04, Fri",13.10
River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589434,"Got up and had a leisurely breakfast with Wingnut, Phaedrus, and Thumper.  I texted Chuck about a ride to Waynesboro.  I am taking a ""Nero"" day today. A nero day is a partial day of hiking, and a partial day of rest.  A Zero day is a day of no hiking.  The 4.9 mile hike was a mixture of nice, comfortable trail, and some uncomfortable rocks, boulders, ups and downs. In some locations (like in the middle of a big boulder field going up) there were no visible white blazes on the trees. It was incredibly frustrating, stopping several times to find the blazes, sometimes moving several steps the wrong direction to finally see a blaze, on a tree BEHIND cover, when there was a very visible tree which should have had a blaze on it. These invisible blazes were interspersed with smooth, soft, open trail, which had blazes on seemingly every tree, as far as the eye could see. Many of the hikers were complaining about it.  
Chuck was going to pick me up at High Rock, but I would have been 3.1 miles short of my goal of reaching the Maryland/Pennsylvania state line.  He graciously agreed to pick me up a little later at the state line, despite the fact that his son's prom was tonight, and Chuck was cooking dinner. He met me close to the line, and walked the rest of the distance to the state line. He recommended a hotel in town (Cobblestone) that was easy walking distance to Walmart, Applebees, and Subway, with a post office not too far away. The hotel had a washer and dryer, free breakfast, and free wifi - a hiker's dream.  He dropped my off, and offered to assist me while I'm in the area if I need it.  Thanks Chuck!  My first official ""Trail Angel""!
As I was checking in, I heard a voice behind me call my name. It was Puddles, who I met during the weekend.  She left a day before me.  Her husband Brian, is very supportive and out for a few days while she gets started. After checking in, I went to the laundry room, waiting for a washer to open.  A gentleman in crocs showed up and I asked if it was his laundry in a the washer, which it was. I asked if he was ""Bite Me"" and it was.  I had heard about him from Thumper the night before, as he was staying in the shelter where I camped.  He left camp earlier than I did, so I hadn't met him yet.  We sat down on the floor of laundry room, and chatted while our laundry was going. I was dressed in my rain kilt, and the only clean shirt I had left. He's a retired biologist from North Carolina, who started a thru hike from Georgia, before getting a hernia.  He had surgery and returned to the trail in Harpers Ferry to do a flip flop hike back to where he left off.  
Had dinner at Applebees.  It's quite different looking at a menu.  I am now looking for what has the MOST calories!  Weird!","Raven Rocks Shelter

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590390,"I decided to take a zero day today, it wasn’t because I felt physically unable to hike, but that I needed to get more organized and caught up. I think it will prove to be very beneficial to me in the long run. I was able to upload all my photos, and catch up my up my journals. I also re-organized my backpack to layout that makes more sense to me. I now have a lot less food and less gear. This will be process for a while, constantly tweaking the system.
Today was my first resupply day out of a store. Prior to going to store, Bite Me and I had dinner with the Canadians.  Matt is now “Snickerdoodle” and Rachelle is “Chattacoochie”.  As Chattacoochie was deciding what beer to select and considered the Yuengling, I suggested that would be appropriate for a Canadian to have a Yuengling as her first “Trail beer”, since it was the oldest brewing company in America. She agreed and was happy with the selection. After dinner, Bite Me and I headed over to Walmart. I selected my food items and we headed over to the toiletries section. Bite Me needed hand sanitizer. As we wandered around in separate aisles, I found the hand sanitizer, and hollered out “Bite Me” as I looked down aisles in search of him. Several customers gave me an odd look, and I directed him to the sanitizer. I found a few more items that I needed then looked for Bite Me. I found him near the foot care area.  He had been having trouble with his shirt rubbing his nipples while he was hiking, which was become quite painful for him. As I walked up to him, he selected a package of corn pads. They are little round cushions with a hole in the middle, designed to keep corns from rubbing on shoes. He held them up and proudly announced, “I think these will work” which immediately made us burst into uncontrollable laughter! More odd looks from customers followed. 
We returned to the hotel where I sorted and organized my food into daily bags. During the flip flop festival, a previous thru hiker mentioned that she organized her food this way and made it easier and more organized. Each daily bag includes all meals and snacks for the entire day. It made sense to me, so that’s how I organized my food. Tomorrow I’ll be back on trail.","

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590506,"Bite me got up and left at 8 o’clock this morning. I also saw Wind Eagle who is having trouble with her right shoulder blade. I gave her a couple of devices to try that I’ve been using to loosen up my muscles. She felt a little better after that and hit the trail I ran into Chattacoochie in the lobby who told me that Snickerdoodle was very sick, and had been throwing up since 3 o’clock in the morning. They’re taking another day for him to recover. All the staff at the hotel (Cobblestone Inn) has been fantastic. They are very “hiker friendly” and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I’ve heard that not all locations along the trail are hiker friendly, probably because hikers are sometimes dirty, with a hiker odor that goes with it. I finished posting journals, and headed to the post office to ship some items forward to a friend in New Jersey, who I’ll be seeing in about 3 weeks, when she’ll pull me off the trail for a break. I hadn’t made any arrangements for a shuttle, so I walked the 3/10 of a mile to the Rouzerville post office. I decided I don’t want to plan every single minute during this adventure. It’s important to me to go with the flow, be spontaneous, and figure things out as I go. Before I retired, one of the things that I looked forward to the most was not rushing around, so I am enjoying just being. 
When I arrived at the post office, I was greeted at the door by John, a local farmer who held the door open for me. He asked if I was hiking trail and I told him I was. He then asked if I needed a ride and I told him yes, that would be great. He was out running errands with his mom, Beckie, who is 94 years old. John patiently waited for me to box my things up, lending me a pen to use. As I got my box processed, I chatted with the postal clerk and postmaster about my hike. As I was leaving, I received a warning about bears and snakes in the area, then received a handful of werthers originals from the postmaster for energy. I tossed my pack in the back of John’s jeep and we proceeded up a steep curvy hill to the location I had stopped hiking two days before. John told me all about the history of the trolley system that ran up and down the hill in the late 1920’s,until a crash of two trollies caused a shutdown of the system. As I got my pack out, I noticed water on the mat in the back of the Jeep. I was looking for the source of water, thinking my hydration pack was leaking. John advised me the water was from an open bucket of water, designated for some lilac bushes. It splashed around as he drive, sitting opposite of my backpack. I took a quick look to see if my pack was wet, then put it on. I shook John’s hand, and thanked him for the ride,then realized I didn’t have my trekking poles! Crap! I took my pack off and tossed it back in the car. We went back down the curvy road to retrieve my poles, and now that I was aware of the bucket of water, I found myself looking over my shoulder to make sure the bucket didn’t spill on to my pack. John was very kind and patient about the situation and told me “that’s why there’s erasers on the end of pencils”. 
He continued to provide historical information, along with other tidbits on various topics. He was very knowledgeable about the history of the area. His mom Beckie was very sweet and chimed in on some of the conversation.  He drove me back up the mountain, where I took my pack, thanked he and his mom and started back where I had left off. I appreciate their kindness very much, my second Trail angels. 
Today’s hike was very pleasant. My pack felt a lot more comfortable. I felt more at one with my pack, rather than being at odds with my pack. I ran into Field Trip and Double H at Deerlick Shelter. My goal was to hike 8.3 miles into Tumble Run Shelters, but with a late start, and the sun going down, I decided I was going to stay at Antietam Shelter. As I approached Antietam, I could hear loud, male, teenage voices, shouting in unison.  As I came Into camp, I saw a large group of teenage boys. At that point I decided to move on to Tumble Run.... where I was greeted with the shrill screams of teenage girls, piercing the forest. It was almost dark by now, so I really had no choice other than to stay at Tumble Run, or move on and find someplace to stealth camp. I stayed, and slept fairly well.","Pennsylvania Maryland Line - Waynesboro, PA
",Tumbling Run Shelters,"May 07, Mon",8.30
River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591091,"I slept in and missed Bite Me and Puddles leaving camp before I got up.  Apparently I need the sleep, so I’m just going with it for now. I’m sure I’ll be getting up with the birds soon enough. I was enjoying my breakfast when the screaming teenage girls, who were no longer screaming, came by.  They were walking in a single file line, packs on, headed to get water. Their packs swallowed them up. They looked so big compared to the girls’ small bodies. 
George, the volunteer caretaker of the shelters came by.  He and his family have been caretakers since the 1990's.  He comes to the shelter every day to fill toilet paper (a majority of shelters do not have toilet paper - it's bring your own) and tend to any issues that need to be addressed.  His son built the privy (otherwise known as an outhouse).  It's very good quality, just like everything at this location.  It includes a pavilion, a snoring and non-snoring shelter, fire pit, clothes lines, and food hanging pole.  I would have to say in my limited experience on the trail, and from talking to other hikers, it's one of the best locations on the trail.  George takes great pride in making it the best, and it shows.
Double H and Field Trip came by before I left.  Double H is using Instagram to document history along the trail. Field Trip is a retired elementary school teacher from Ohio and looking for Lady Slipper flowers. He has also been featured in the Mighty Blue Podcast. They are both great guys.
The hiking was very peaceful in the morning hiking this morning.  It started off sunny and became overcast with a light rain, but not enough to get wet. I stopped at Chimney Rocks for a snack and a great view. In the afternoon I came across a box in the middle of the woods with a trail log. It was a pleasant surprise.  I stopped and signed the book. I chatted with ""Lefty"" who was going SOBO (southbound). 
Mid to late afternoon I got into my trail cadence. The sun had come back out so I had my umbrella deployed and was moving along a good pace, the exertion almost effortless. Off trail, just to the right of me, I heard a distinct sssssssss.... for a split second I scanned the ground, looking to see what it was. Up to this point in my life, I've never had an encounter with a rattlesnake. My understanding of rattlesnakes is that they don't rattle unless they are threatened. I'm sure the sight of my umbrella coming down the trail looked like a giant cobra to him. I don't know if rattlesnakes and cobras are mortal enemies, but I wasn't willing to stick around and find out. My natural instincts kicked in, and I ran until I couldn’t hear the rattle anymore. My heart was pounding and my hands were trembling. I finally calmed down and was on a relatively smooth part of the trail, with a few rocks. I started to get a drink of water, glancing down briefly to look at my hydration tube. My boot tread got caught on a rock, and down I went! Up to this point on the trail, I had stumbled over rocks, stubbing my toe guard, or sometimes pulling my toes back, stretching the front of my ankle. I looked back and saw the culprit, a triangular shaped rock, pointing straight up. It had caught me mid-tread on my boot. I didn’t hit my face, but I did get a nice lump and scrape on my left shin. 
As I continued on, I encountered some boulders and a climb took a while to get through. I was approaching a road that led to Fayetteville, PA. One of my hiking buddies suggested I stop at Timbers Restaurant to eat. It’s a mom-and-pop joint 1/2 mile west of the trail off US 30 in Fayetteville Pennsylvania. It was around 7pm, and I only had 4/10 of a mile to get to the state park to bed down for the night, so I decided to take advantage of a burger and fries. Tim and Wanda are the owners, and are absolutely fantastic. They welcome hikers with open arms. They have a hiker log to sign, poster boards for hikers to sign, a charging station, and a hiker box. They serve breakfast all day, lunch, dinner, and ice cream! I had a burger and chocolate milk. The burger was made fresh and was great. I chatted with Tim and Wanda for a few minutes and left after the sun set. 
I hiked to Caledonia State Park with my headlamp on. I had called earlier, and got an answering machine. The message indicated that late arrivals should go to the office, and follow the instructions, using the honor system, paying with a payment envelope. Not wanting to break any rules, and wanting to stay in the park, I arrived and saw a sign indicating the direction of the office. After that, there were no signs. I wandered around for about 40 minutes, trying to find the office. I had a map on my phone, but it was dark and hard to figure out where I was since I couldn't see any landmarks beyond whatever location I was. The maps didn't do me any good since I didn't know where I was, so I couldn't figure out where I was going. I eventually found the office and saw map of where the campground was. I pulled it up on my phone and tried to get an interactive map so I could figure out how far it was. I figured it couldn’t be too far so I picked a site, put my money in the envelope and put it in the payment box. I wandered a little bit, then saw a sign that pointed to where the campground was, down Route 233. I walked to the road and looked in the direction of the campground, seeing nothing but darkness. I checked on my phone, trying to figure out how far it was, coming across information that indicated it was a quarter-mile from that intersection that I was near, so I started walking, and walking, and walking, and walking...in the dark with my headlamp on. When I knew had easily gone more than a quarter-mile, I started to regret my decision, thinking that I should’ve called a shuttle while I was at Timbers to take me to a local hostel. I was in too deep now, so I kept walking. It ended up being at least a mile. I went into a driveway that I thought may take me to campsites, but ended up near what appeared to be vacant buildings. I felt like ghosts were watching me from inside, so I quickly went back to the road and continued on. I finally arrived at the park, trying to be quiet and not to disturb any of the campers. I quietly found my campsite and started setting up camp. A few minutes later, a truck pulling an RV pulled up to a campsite near me. The driver kept trying to maneuver the RV in the place, as his wife was outside the vehicle, trying to help him navigate. He was hollering at her, and was obviously frustrated he couldn't get the RV to go where he wanted. He ended up in a position where his headlights were pointing directly across at other campers who were sleeping. The campers across the road started yelling at the driver to shut his headlights off. After 25 minutes of unsuccessful parking of the RV, they left the site and went to the other side of the park and disturbed other campers. When I returned from the showers, they were either gone or they had parked and just went to sleep.

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591097,"The first steps in the morning are the hardest. I slip my feet into my camp shoes and stand gingerly, as the there is always a “zing” to the feet, like pins and needles.The first few days I simply put my shoes on, got up and tried to walk, usually coming to a complete standstill, due to the discomfort. I've learned to ease into the first steps. It takes a few minutes for my feet to feel somewhat normal, as the blood circulates through them. 
I took a shower, finding the only thing I had to dry off with was a half of a Trader Joe absorb-able towel, and a salty bandana. It seemed to work pretty well, and I finished drying off under the electric hand dryer. It’s funny the things that you remember when you’re not in a position to retrieve them. As I was in the shower I was thinking that I should’ve grabbed my rain kilt to put on after I got out of the shower to cover up. I wear it when I when I do laundry, but I never considered it for going to shower. I ate breakfast and as I packed up, John, a camper from New York stop by to chat. We talked about my hike. When he found out I was going to Maine, he recommended Oak Pond Brewery. I'm not sure where that is in relation to the trail, but I thanked him for the information. I walked the mile back to the main part of the state park where several groups of elementary children were on a field trip. Everything looked so different in daylight! I went back to where I ended hiking the night before. I ran into Nicole, who was looking for water. I had met her yesterday at Tumbling Run. She is hiking until Saturday, trying to get as far as she can. I enjoyed a well groomed trail, until the park ended, and I was met with my morning climb, a half mile elevation of rocks. I'm still trying to get my trail legs so it was challenging. 
I stopped at Quarry Gap Shelter for lunch. Nicole stopped also.  It was warm so the break was nice, with cold spring water at our disposal. The rest of the 10 mile day was a nice hike to Birch Run Shelter.","Caledonia State Park

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591533,"I awoke to the gentle and quiet sound of bells softly ringing at 6:00 a.m.. It’s not a sound typically heard in the wilderness, unless Buddhists on a pilgrimage are at camp. It was their wake up alarm. A short time later, the aroma of incense wafted into my tent through the screening. It was a wonderfully relaxing way to wake up, which I would gladly use to replace my alarm at home if it was feasible. No heart pounding after hitting the snooze too many times then realizing I’m late, or worse yet, accidently shutting the alarm off altogether.  I haven’t set an alarm at camp yet. Waking up has been a natural process. This morning felt even more natural and relaxed. I layed on my sleeping pad, enjoying the sounds and scents. 
No Doubt took off and said he was headed for the half-gallon ice cream challenge. He knew he wasn’t going to feel well afterward, but was going to do it anyway. Noodle came into the shelter as I was packing up. She decided she was going to spend the day there. She’s also a flip-flopper.  After eating breakfast and packing, I left going the opposite direction of the Buddhists. I was disappointed that I wouldn’t have another opportunity to wake up as I had this morning.
I could hear some thunder in the distance, but the sky didn’t look threatening, so I left and shortly thereafter, and took my morning climb. After the climb, it leveled off and started raining, so I put my umbrella up and went to take a drink of water out of my hydration hose and.,.nothing. I didn’t check my hose to make sure it worked before I left. I didn’t feel like stopping to fix it as I had just attacked my umbrella to my shoulder strap. I also had a bottle of water to sip from if needed. I stopped a while later and took a look in my pack, moved a couple of things, checked the hose and it worked  I put my pack on and started hiking, it didn’t work. I eventually stopped at a stream and basically unloaded almost everything in my pack  I had changed the configuration from what I had been packing things, so I put it back to how I had been doing it. As I leaned over my pack I smelled something stinky and thought “what is that smell?”  As continued my unpacking and re-packing, I kept smelling it.  I finally realized it was me! I try to keep myself clean with wipes and wiping myself down at streams, but the sweating and no consistent, daily ahower was finally catching up with me,and i was gstting “hiker stank”. It was bound to happen sooner or later.There was trail magic along way in the form of tapwater, blueberry donut holes, and Gatorade bottles in the stream. Each was at various locations in the woods.The terrain varied throughout the day, but was nothing extremely difficult. I stopped at Tom’s Run Shelter pavilion to eat lunch and free my feet from my boots. I went to the shelter to sign the log and met Liberty, a woman from California who was inside the shelter journaling. I signed the log after some small talk, then packed up to leave. I could hear thunder in the distance and prepared accordingly by putting on gaiters and a light DWR jacket. As I was getting ready to depart, I decided to check the weather forecast as the sky looked more volatile than it did in the morning. There was a storm warning with hail up to dime size possible, and wind gusts up to 50 miles an hour. I immediately moved to the shelter to wait it out and informed Liberty what was headed our way. We conversed as the wind picked up and it began pouring rain. A hiker came from around the corner of the shelter, sprinting to get out of the storm. He apologized for his abrupt entry and climbed into the shelter. He was Red Bird, a thru hiker from California who had started in Georgia. The three of us watched the rain turn to hail, bouncing off the picnic table. After about a half hour, the storm began to let up and the sun started to shine through the trees. I saw what I thought was a rainbow, but it disappeared quickly. I thought I was seeing things and mentioned it to the others, when suddenly a rainbow appeared in the woods. I’ve seen rainbows, but never anything like this. We all sat in amazement at the beauty of it. I took several pictures and videos. After it disappeared, I departed the shelter and continued my hike through the fresh air brought on by the rainfall. I came to the half way point of the trail, mileage wise and had thunder nipping at my heels as I came down the mountain, trying to get to the campground ahead. I arrived at the Pine Grove Furnace State Park main office, which was closed. I texted Puddles and Ambassador with no response. Based on my experience at Caledonia State Park,I thought I should find the campground before I paid. I called Puddles and a polite young man named Kyle answered the phone (which I later found out was her son). I immediately remembered that she said her calls were being forwarded to her real estate business. He said she was away and that he could help. I explained that he wouldn’t be able to help me, as I was trying to find her “in the woods”. I pulled my phone out and started following my Guthook app to what it indicated as being the State Park,4/10 of a mile away. When I arrived at the destination,there were no signs for the campground, and no one around.i texted Puddles,indicating I was near the snack bar and asked where to go. She didn’t know where I was and said she would walk out to the road and look for me. I crossed a bridge I thought would lead to the campground, with no luck.Puddles called me and did her best to try to direct me into the campground. Because she didn’t know where I was, and I didn’t know where she was, it wasn’t working. She mentioned the general store and told me where to go from there, so I headed back that direction, which was about 1/2 mile away from me.  A short time later, she texted me said someone was coming to pick me up. It was Wind Eagle! She was slack packing with a home base at the campground. Trail Angels,even among hikers!  She took me to the site next to Puddles and Roaming Ambassador Dorothy. I set up camp, ate dinner and showered. 
The shower was incredibly frustrating. It was a push button, which released a burst of warm (not hot) water in 8 second intervals. I get the idea of water conservation. I try to do it myself with efficient appliances,and not running it unnecessarily, but eight seconds?  It’s barely enough time to wash or rinse any body part. At least the shower at Caledonia ran for 30 seconds at a time, and I thought that was short! To add to my exasperation, the button was about a foot above my head, so I had to hold my arms straight up over my head and push it in. I was getting cold so I pushed the button multiple times, like I was performing CPR, in hopes I could build up time by adding the eight second intervals together. As soon as I stopped, the water lasted...eight seconds. The water wasn’t very warm anyway, so I stopped once i was clean. After drying off with my miniature towel and banana, I went to the sink and brushed my teeth. The sink was also a push button with automatic shut off. I pushed the button to wet my brush. I brushed my teeth, rinsed, and left to retire to my tent, the water in tbe sink still running...","

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592227,"I hadn’t paid for my campsite, so I sought out the campground host. I inquired about the host from a woman at the campground and she directed me to him. She then stopped at an RV where a woman (who I would later find out was Wanda) was cooking breakfast for several people. Wanda said “there’s a lot of bacon over here” as if she was encouraging people to take more. I had already eaten breakfast but was still hungry and bacon sounded good, so I walked up to Wanda and politely asked if I could buy some bacon, after explaining about being a hiker. She told me I didn’t need buy it, I could just have some. I insisted on paying she said to take some, then asked if I wanted breakfast. Someone at the table invited me to sit down. I again offered to pay and she wouldn’t have it. I ended up eating two eggs over easy, two scrambled eggs, toast, hashbrowns, orange juice, and several slices of bacon. There were 13 family members and friends who were staying at different campsites, but met for breakfast and dinner at Wanda, Bill, and Lucy’s (their dog) campsite. Family and friends rotated in and out, eating their breakfast. There were some teenage girls who were curious about my backpacking trip. They stopped by my campsite later and we chatted a bit more about it. A man later showed up dressed in camouflage, who had been turkey hunting. He was getting questioned by Wanda about where the turkey was for dinner. I hung around for a bit after breakfast, taking to family members, then returned to my campsite. Thanks for breakfast Wanda, Bill, and Lucy!
I spent some time with Puddles and Roaming Ambassador Dorothy. I got a ride out of the campground from Lee, who was slack packing Wind Eagle. She dropped me off at the general store where they have the half gallon ice cream challenge, this being the half way point of the trail. Field Trip was there opening his resupply box. I had a burger and picked up a few necessities for a short resupply, and hung out with Field Trip and other hikers. We talked about storm the day before. Everyone who had been in the woods saw a rainbow after the storm. It didn’t matter where anyone was, even miles apart, we all saw a rainbow.
I left the general store and stopped at the A.T.Museum, then hiked for a little over 3 miles, before having an incline up some boulders. When I got to the top, Field Trip was there.  He found a nice stealth tenting spot. He invited me to set up camp, and after chatting for a few minutes, I looked at the map and decided to stay there for the night. It was too late to get to the next shelter at a decent time. We had also heard through the grape vine that there was a couple of hikers not too far behind us who were creating havoc along the trail. I thought it was best that I didn’t go on and end up at a campsite by myself, and we both felt there was strength in numbers. Besides,he’s great company. He’s a retired elementary school teacher from Ohio, looking for lady’s slipper flowers and butterflies during his hike. I didn’t know what a lady’s slipper was until I met him. It’s also known as the Pink-and-white Lady's-slipper or the Queen's Lady's-slipper, and is a rare, terrestrial, temperate, lady's-slipper orchid native to northern North America. I love spending time around him. I was a little nervous about being away from a shelter for camping. He had been backcountry camping several times and reassured me that we would have no problem getting through the night without any issues with bears. We hung our food bag lines, then had dinner and great conversation. It was my first time actually hanging my line.  Whenever I’ve been backpacking, my friend Jo (Hummingbird) always hung the food bags. I found a great branch that stuck out and away from the tree, which was perfect. I threw rock bag over the branch but didn’t unwind all of my line, so it went up off the ground. I pulled the line down, and my second throw went up and over the branch perfectly. After dinner we hung our food bags.  I clipped my bag onto the carabiner and pulled it up.  I was attempting to do the PCT method of hanging the bag, which requires the use of a stick, and a clove hitch knot. I was in the middle of putting the bag up,and couldn’t remember howto do a clove hitch. I referred to a diagram on my phone, and got the clove hitch correctly, then realized I had pulled the rope out of the carabiner, which is required to lock the food bag in place. Field Trip had been assisting me almost the entire time, but wasn’t familiar with the PCT method of hanging a bag. I ended up tying my line on a nearby tree. I knowvnext time I hang my bag, I should be able to do the PCT method.  Field Trip and I settled into our tents after talking for a bit, and I mapped out some possible scenarios for mileage for upcoming days. At about 2:40 in the morning, I awoke to hard rain and gusty wind. Fortunately the wind was blowing through the treetops and wasn’t effecting my tent At home I would never wake up during a storm like this, I always sleep through them. Not this night. I laid there thinking “is there any dead trees near my tent? Is there any dead branches above me? Is water going to gush into the tent?” I stayed perfectly dry and comfortable the entire night.","Pine Grove Furnace State Park

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592905,"At about 6:20am, after we started rustling to get up, I heard Field Trip say “we made it! No bears!” We got up, had breakfast, and packed up. Fog rolled in as we were breaking camp. Reboot, a thru hiker with a British accent came by camp before we left.  
It was a crisp, cool, damp morning, much cooler than previous mornings. I hiked in shorts and a T-shirt, thinking I would warm up, but it took a while. My hands stayed cold as fog continued to roll in. The hike was typical with ups, downs, and flats, including the usual “morning climb”.  As I made my way along, I kept checking the time and my pace, due to a thunderstorm in the forecast. At 3.4 miles out from the next shelter, I concluded the storm would hit at a time that I would be between a road crossing and the shelter. I knew there was no way I could make it to the shelter before the storm hit. I also didn’t know how many people were at the shelter, or if there would be any space available. I could hear the storm faintly in the distance, so I decided to contact a shuttle service for availability. Michael answered the phone and I told him where I was and that I would like to be picked up at Whiskey Springs Rd.  I estimated I would be there in 1 hour. He told me it would take two hours, and based on my pace up to that point, I countered. He then asked if I had made it to “the rocks” yet. Up to this point, I had walked over all kinds of different kinds of rocks. Little rocks, medium rocks, mixtures of rocks...rocks, rocks, rocks. At the time I called him, I was going through a beautiful pine forest with a nice, smooth, soft, pine needle trail. Apparently, I hadn’t gone through “the rocks” yet. I told him the rocks would probably slow me down, but I did not believe it would take me two hours to get to the road. He said he could pick me up, and we agreed that I would call him when I was a half a mile from the road. Shortly after hanging up, I arrived at “the rocks”. He wasn’t kidding! These were giant boulders The trail weaved in and out, up, over and down. every which way around the boulders. From what I could see, the trail could’ve gone alongside most of the boulders, but it appeared as though the people mapping out the trail thought it would be fun to create a maze that hikers wound have to have to climb up, down, and around. Up to this point I was thinking that my upper body strength was starting to wane, so I finally had an opportunity for an upper body workout. I had to climb rocks and opted to leave my pack on. I probably should’ve hoisted it on top of the boulders first, but liking a good challenge, I climbed up and down the boulders with my pack on, sometimes tossing my trekking poles ahead. I got through the boulders and came to a nice evergreen forest, with the trail covered in pine needles. I waited until I was a half a mile from the road then called Michael and told him where I was and my anticipated time to arrive at the road. Almost as soon as I hung up, I encountered more boulders. Holy cow! I thought I was done with them. I made my way through the remaining boulders and scurried down to the road with the thunder now nipping at my heels. I made it to the meet location in 52 minutes, and had to wait a bit for Michael to arrive. It’s amazing what an impending thunderstorm will do to motivate someone to move a little faster from the top of a mountain. We headed to the Days Inn in Carlisle. Still needing to hike the 14 miles between Whiskey Springs Road and Carlisle, I figured I could do it with a couple of ""Nero"" days out of Carlisle. I asked Michael what amenities were in the area of the hotel. I knew there was a diner and a convenience store/gas station. There wasn't much else, but the hotel was convenient to the trail. I asked if there was any place to get beer. I found out Pennsylvania law only allows beer to be sold from a bar or distribution store. He offered to take me back to a distribution store, turned around, and took me to Stan‘s where I got a couple of local micro brews. I paid for mine, and a six pack for him for his trouble. I arrived at the Days Inn, which needed serious attention. It was a very transient hotel, primarily catering to backpackers and truck drivers. Carlisle is a large trucking hub of the east coast, and the Appalachian Trail is 3/10 of a mile away. Rumor has it that the hotel is going to become a different hotel soon, so I'm sure the owners don't want to put any money into it. It had a warm shower, clean bed with no bed bugs, and a washer and dryer, a backpacker's dream. Despite all the amenities, I never walked on the floor without my camp shoes on.
I took a shower, went to the the Middlesex diner next-door and had a big hamburger, french fries and chocolate milk, my meal of choice the past week, as I’ve eaten it three times.","Campsite North of Pine Grove Furnace

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592906,"I slept fairly good on and off.  I decided to get my laundry done last night, before other hikers came in today. There was a lot of rain, and with that, a lot of mud, so the washers and dryers would be in high demand. I started my laundry at 11 p.m., dozed off, got up at 1 a.m. and put my clothes in the dryer. I woke up again at 4 a.m. and got my clothes out of the dryer. I had breakfast at the hotel, and chatted with several hikers. Mighty Mouse and Shaggy were doing a thru hike from Georgia and were a wealth of information. Thumper showed up, and I saw Double H checking out to head north. It was raining quite hard in the morning and I decided to ice my sore joints and muscles. I had a phone call with nephews, and my mom and dad, wishing my mom a happy Mother’s Day. The rain stopped and I decided to knock out eight of the 14 mile section that I had missed. I hiked from the hotel, which is only 2/10 of a mile from the trail, south to Boiling Springs. I took a bottle of water and a couple of snacks. It was nice not to have a full pack. On Monday I will take a shuttle back to Whiskey Springs Road and hike north to Boiling Springs. About a half mile out, I ran into Field Trip! He was tired and ready for a hotel room. He had stayed in the shelter 12 miles away, last night during the storm. I texted him after I decided to come off the trail yesterday and he said the shelter was packed, and I made a good choice getting off trail and going to the hotel. 
As I hiked along the damp and sometimes muddy trail, it was very fragrant. When I left home, I was disappointed that I was going to miss The Russian Olive trees in bloom. It’s one of my favorite things to smell in the spring. The blooms are very fragrant and I always look forward to it. As I started down the trail, Russian Olive trees started to appear. They lined the trail almost the entire way to Boiling Springs. I kept inhaling large breaths of air, taking in the full fragrance. It made me not miss home so much. It was a very pleasant, flat hike to Boiling Springs. The air was fresh after the recent rainfall. I saw a bluebird, a couple of rabbits, and a woodchuck along the way. Bluebirds are my favorite bird. I always look forward to spring when I can try to entice them into a nesting box in my yard. If they show up, I immediately put meal worms out to encourage them to stay. 
Occasionally, I would see an imprint of Field Trip's size 15 shoes going the opposite direction. It’s so nice to hike without a pack on for a change. I wanted to get used to my pack before I started any slack packing, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to take advantage of the hotel being so close to the trail. I opted to hike 8 miles today and 6 miles on Monday to break up the 14 miles I had intended to hike on Monday. It will give my body more of a break, by doing active recovery days. If I don’t take care of my body, it’s not going get me through the entire hike. I'm having some tightness in my right shin muscle, so I don't want to irritate it too much. The hike encompassed open pastures, woods, and fenced in horse pastures. Getting in and out of the pastures is interesting. Stairs are built up and over the fences. I love the ingenuity.
I passed a few hikers going northbound. Two miles from Boiling Springs, I passed thru hikers who had a distinct marijuana odor. Today’s hike is fairly easy, but I certainly wouldn’t want to be under the influence of anything hiking out here. It’s hard enough to hike otherwise. It was a very pleasant hike. I really enjoyed not having my pack, and not having my feet and ankles getting torqued in my boots. I considered it an active rest day, or active recovery day. It was great to get some miles in, and have a nice, peaceful, enjoyable hike, even though it was in the mud. It was misting the entire time, but not a soaking mist. It was a good ""rest"" day.","Carlisle

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592907,"I woke up and got breakfast at the hotel, then joined Puddles in our scheduled shuttle at 8:15. It would be a short slack pack day for me. Puddles was going a little further, hiking from Boiling Springs north past Carlisle. I was hiking 6 miles from Whiskey Springs Road to Boiling Springs to complete the section I didn't finish when I came off trail two days ago. It was a damp, foggy, peaceful morning. The ground was still wet from the rain yesterday. I started off hiking over some rocks and then had a short climb, settling in at a nice, easy pace. My knees, right ankle, and right shin were a little sore, so I was hiking slower than yesterday. It would be an easy day of hiking, an active rest/recovery day. 
Some of the rock formations are amazing. It makes me wonder how the rocks ended up where they are and in the configurations that they’re in. Looking at some things along the trail makes me want to do more research into the history behind either the geology, or the history behind things like family cemeteries. I had Michael shuttle me back to the hotel yesterday, and he told me about a town that no longer exists, except for remnants of some buildings, the tannery which can still be identified, and a cemetery. The town was called ""Pandemonium"". He didn’t know how the name came about, so I was curious and looked it up online. Legend has it there were several ethnic backgrounds making up the town. Because of diversity, people argued about what the language of the church should be. At that point the town didn’t have a name. Because of all the arguing that was going on, one man yelled, ""we should just call ourselves pandemonium, because that’s what this is!""
 Three thru hikers from Georgia passed me. We exchanged pleasantries. The men are usually getting quite skinny by now, and many of the women gained enormous muscles in their legs. One of the three was a female this morning. She had long, red, braided ponytails. As she passed me, I couldn’t help but notice how large her calves were. It was amazing for her size. A lot of the men lose muscle mass making this trek, and many women gain enormous muscle mass. Unfortunately it’s almost all lower body and I fear I will use some of my upper body strength during the next six months.The last hiker to pass me had a British accent. I mentioned I was still trying to get my trail legs under me. He assured me that they would come. He said when they do, it would be a marked difference in my hiking. I’m looking forward to that day, but in the meantime I need to remain injury free. 
I came across a single spiderweb strand that went from a tree to a rock, spanning approximately eight feet across the trail. I still can't figure out how they can make a strand of web material go across the trail like that. Most of the time, it ends up on my face as I'm hiking. I had a water crossing, and as I was trying to determine where I was going to cross, a small snake swam through the water away from me to the other side. 
As I hiked, I reflected on my almost 2 weeks on the trail, thinking about what I really enjoyed. It’s the people. The community is amazing. Everyone supports each other and encourages each other. It’s not a race and everybody is willing to give advice and tips. We all learn from each other out here. I enjoy the solitude during the day. I haven’t hiked with anyone, but socialize in the beginning and end of the day. It’s a nice mixture of the social aspect along with the solitude. Yesterday at breakfast someone mentioned they heard someone say that the trail exposes all of your weaknesses. 100 miles down, and I realize this is true. I’m in decent physical shape, but the rigors of the trail, along with the weight I carry on my back, definitely made me feel some discomfort. I'm not as organized and efficient as I'd like to be, and continue to ""tweak"" my ""system"".  I feel stronger every day. I have to temper my desire and drive, with common sense to remain healthy. A journey to be enjoyed and savored
I also thought about how important feet are in accomplishing a thru hike. My foot care, includes soaking my feet in cold water, switching out to dry socks throughout the day, and reapplying anti-friction cream to my feet I make sure my boots are tied in such a fashion that my feet don’t slide to the end of my boots. It requires cinching up laces where the ankle bends to keep feet secure, so the toes don’t slide in the boot. This is how people lose toenails, especially if footwear is small and toes hit then end of the toe box. My boots are one size larger than normal, which is common on the trail. It’s necessary to have footwear larger than normal to accommodate socks, swelling of the feet, and movement of the foot. I’ve been very fortunate in the section hikes I’ve done, along with the current hike, to be blister free. In addition, I utilize a file to keep calluses filed down. For CrossFit workouts, I file hand calluses so the calluses don't rip open when using the pull-up bar or barbells.  I file my foot calluses to keep them from ripping open.  
Trail Names
Most everyone on the trail has a trail name. Some people select their name before coming out on the trail, others are bestowed a trail name from other hikers, usually stemming from a mistake, or something odd about the person. Some trail names have deep meaning to the person and selected as a reminder of who they want to be, or be more like. Some people pick their own names so they don't end up with one they don't want. There’s many different reasons people choose trail names for others, but if you start hiking without one, you feel pressured to get one so you can fit in.
Safety 
It’s funny how people back home worry about my safety. People definitely have misconceptions about the trail and the safety aspect. I actually feel safer here than I do in ""society"". Sure there’s bears, and snakes and other things, but typically they’re more afraid of humans then we are of them. Violent encounters on the trail are very rare, as our bear attacks. I feel very comfortable out here, surrounded by my trail family, or ""tramily"". I am more concerned about ticks than anything else. 
Support System
I have an excellent support system. I wouldn’t be able to do this without it. T is taking care of the home front while I’m gone. I tried to take care of as many things as I could before I left, including getting vet appointments done, setting up automatic payments and other things. I appreciate Tressa's support more than I can say. It’s nice to be able to come out here, and not feel guilty about being gone for six months. it was hard to leave, but I knew once I got out here and started hiking that I would feel comfortable. I also have great friends that I know will not only support me on my journey, but will support her during the time that I’m gone. I appreciate the messages I've received from friends. I feel very supported by friends and family.  
I'm oblivious to what’s going on at home most of the time.  It is a totally different life from being at home. Tressa teased me before I left about me ""going on vacation"". It is a vacation of sorts, but it’s definitely a working vacation with physical, mental, and emotional challenges. There are camp chores to be done every day, and on days off, or partial days in town, there are additional chores in the form of laundry, resupply, figuring out future resupplies and orders, and other odd and end. I have friends that will be meeting me at different locations throughout my journey which I greatly appreciate. It gives me something to look forward to as I continue on. I also look forward to hiking with my dad when I flip-flop back to Harpers Ferry and begin my journey south. He will join me somewhere in the Shenandoah Valley. Knowing that he will hike with me at that point keeps me motivated to keep moving on. If I don’t complete the northern half, I won’t have an opportunity to backpack with my dad.
When I arrived at Boiling Springs today, I stopped at the ATC for a minute, went to the outfitter, checked on an Uber ride, then ate lunch at Cafe 101. During my lunch, I had a conversation with Teresa, who was sitting near me.  We talked for most of lunch. As I was getting ready to summon an uber, I realized the price had gone up from $17 when I checked it before lunch, to $24. I made a comment about not understanding how the price jumped so much during the time I was eating lunch. She asked where I was going and told me she was going to  Carlisle, and offered me a ride. The only ""catch"" was that she had to stop at Aldi. No problem, I needed a couple of items anyway, and I had never shopped there. I thoroughly enjoyed our conversation at lunch and in the car during the ride to Carlisle. I noticed that she had an angel hanging from her rear view mirror.  How appropriate for a true ""trail angel"".  Thank you Teresa Irvin for the ride from Boiling Springs to Carlisle.  You are an official ""trail angel"", and your kindness very much appreciated.","Whiskey Springs Road

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592908,"Today I’m heading back out on the trail with my pack. I’ve stayed at the Days Inn long enough and it’s time to move on. I rearranged things in my pack, and moved a small bag I had been attaching to the back of the pack to the front for easier access to snacks. I hiked for two hours and stopped at a stream to soak my feet and eat lunch.  The hike took me through grassy fields, a functional cow pasture, and wooded areas with fragrant blooms from Russian Olive trees. It was quite an interesting range of fragrance from the cow pasture to the blooms! It was sunny and 87 degrees, and although it’s hard, I feel stronger than I have in previous days. I didn't want to push it too hard and force myself into heat exhaustion, as I don't do well in the heat. When I sat down to lunch, the chance of thunderstorms was 40%. My friend Jodi sent me a text warning me about storms coming in. After lunch, the chance of thunderstorms was 90%, and I could hear thunder in the distance. I quickly packed up my belongings and headed toward a nearby road about half a mile away. The forecast called for up to dime size hail, and 60-75 mph straight line winds. I knew I couldn't get to the shelter before the storm hit, so I figured I would get to the road, and catch a ride if I could. When I got there I was delighted to find a tunnel under the road in which I could take cover. The storm hadn’t come in yet so I dragged a log into the tunnel and made myself comfortable. I waited it out as several hikers came through. I was getting sprayed with rain as it was being blown into the tunnel, despite me being so far inside of it. A day hiker came through and stopped in the tunnel for a bit. He seemed very agitated at getting caught in the storm. When everything cleared, I hiked up to Darlington Shelter, passing several downed trees and limbs, as well as large puddles in the trail. The shelter was packed. T-Bird and RX were there, along with 60'ish Sisters, who are also doing a flip-flop hike. There were also several other young hikers who were thru hiking from Georgia. I also found out later that Puddles had to sprint in to the shelter during the storm, the second time on her hike that she got caught in a thunderstorm. I pitched my tent, ate dinner and fell asleep almost immediately.","Carlisle

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592912,"I woke up this morning I realized I hadn't taken my contacts out since I fell asleep so quickly. I woke up to the sound of rain pelting my tent. I fell back to sleep, and by the time I got up, almost everyone had left. I got my food bag out of the bear box and returned to my tent to cook my breakfast in the vestibule. I made some alterations to my tent by hanging a line inside my tent from peak to help my dry clothes on in the future. I packed everything up in my backpack and pulled it out of my tent. The last thing I did was take my tent down and stuffed it into the side pocket of my backpack, and off I went. It was very nice hiking, and cooler than yesterday. Everything is covered with rain, including the trail, which created areas of mud. The hike consisted of going through forest, and open pastures with tall grass. Although the tall grass in an open field is nice, that’s where ticks are. I’ve taken extra precautions to protect myself from getting bit by ticks. All my clothing has been treated with permethrin, spray myself with tick spray, and I have flea and tick collars looped through the laces of my boots. As I came up on the field with very tall grass that encroached into the trail, I stopped and put on my zip off pants legs. It is one more layer of added protection. You can’t be too careful to protect against Lyme disease. I stopped to take several pictures raindrops on plants today. They look like little rain diamonds. That is what is catching my eye today. Every day seems to be something different that gets my attention. It's mainly been flowers up to this point. I never know what kind of flowers they are but I enjoy trying to capture their essence in a photo. I ran into Giselle before I hit the grass fields. She’s a through hiker from Washington DC, who started in Georgia. After the grassy pastures, I enter back into the forest where I came up on several trees, freshly downed by the storm yesterday. They were calling for straight-line winds which apparently came through this area, as the trees were uprooted or broken down into the trail. As I approach one tree that was down, I observed a woman climbing over the it. She Was from the local area, and doing a section hike. She is trying to string together some section hikes close to home before she starts venturing out further. Her trail name is Mother Puma. We chatted for quite a while and had a very pleasant conversation, exchanging information about hiking and then parted ways. She was going the opposite direction of me. There were several downed trees along the way, most of which had to be routed around. I stopped at a stream to get water and fashioned a protective cover with my umbrella and hiking poles. I had a nice location to sit, staying dry while exchanging dry shocks for wet ones. Roaming Embassador Dorothy showed up and also got water. We chatted for a few moments and she took off for the next shelter. I was telling her how great I was feeling, and that I would probably continue on into Duncannon. I continued on, coming into some pointed rocks, sticking up out of the trail, which I refer to now as ""foot torquers"". I actually have a few more descriptive words for them, but want to keep my blog rated for all ages, so for now, they are foot torquers. I got to Cove Mountain shelter, which was 1/10th of a mile away off the main trail. I checked my trail app and saw that it was 3.6 miles into Duncannon. Looking at the time, and what my normal hiking pace was, I knew I could make it into Duncannon before dark. I looked at the trail before me and it was a nice soft path of decomposing leaves. It lured me into the forest, promising good trails to come. About 3/10 of a mile in, I started encountering some rocks. They were the typical rocks that I’ve been walking on since the beginning of the hike, interspersed along the way. I walked between rocks in some dirt, with decaying leaves. It was slowing me up a bit but I still figured I could make it to Duncannon before dark. I then encountered a very steep climb, which kept going, and going, and going and ended at Hawk Rock. I’m sure normally it’s a very nice view, but today there was thick fog, and no view. After passing Hawk Rock, the trail took a sharp descent into steps fashioned out of rocks. It was very steep, and I was only comfortable taking one step at a time, mostly sideways, making sure that both my feet were solid on each step. I did not want to fall down the steps, so I tediously taking one step at a time down...down...down. I then came across the mountainside completely covered with rocks. There were steps fashioned out of rocks, going through the middle of the rocks, but it was still a very difficult descent. It felt much more difficult going down this hill than any of the climbs I have encountered so far. I could feel the sides of my big toes rubbing on my shoes and getting hotspots, but I did not feel comfortable stopping at any point to try to change out my socks. I kept checking my trail app and at one point it told me I had 1.9 miles to go then it told me I had 2 miles to go then went to 1.2 and then back up to 1.9. Darkness was now settling in because I was moving so slow. I had one mile to go and had to pull out my headlamp. This particular part of the trail was hard enough when it was light out, but it was also raining, and now dark. I continue to move slowly and very carefully down the mountain until I finally reached flat ground. Knowing that there was no way I was going to make it to the shelter, I called the Red Carpet Inn. Fortunately they still had ride service available and I headed into town for a ride. The driver was Dave. His name didn’t really seem appropriate given his heavy Indian accent, but he was great. He pulled up I asked him where he was taking me, just to confirm that he was the one who was supposed to be picking me. After I got in, he pulled up toward a convenient store and asked me if I wanted to go in and buy anything, which of course, I did. I quickly ran in and bought ice cream, potato chips, a packet of salmon, a banana, a stick of beef jerky, and something to drink. I arrived at the motel, checked in, and received two bottles of water. I got to my room and set up my boots, socks, and insoles to dry and ate all the food I purchased. The room was very simple and small, with just enough room for the bed, a small dresser and a sink in the room. The bathroom had a shower stall and toilet. I turned up the heat to ensure that my boots and socks would be dry by morning, and settled in for a good nights sleep.","Darlington Shelter, PA

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592911,"As I was packing up, there was a knock at the door. It was one of the hotel workers asking if I was going to stay another night or if I was checking out. I told her I was checking out she said the shuttle would be leaving for town, but she said they could wait for me. I quickly put the rest of my things in my pack, knowing that I would have to tend to my feet when I got to town. I was getting ready to drain the small blister I developed yesterday before I heard the knock on the door. While at the motel I took some ibuprofen and did a melt ball treatment on my feet, as well as a cupping treatment with some essential oils. I'm feeling a lot better. After the driver dropped me off, I sat in front of the Doyle hotel and drained my small blister one more time. I applied Leuko tape over it, as well as two pairs of socks to prevent rubbing on the foot itself. T-Bird was in front of the door of the Doyle. He had been up since early this morning waiting to hike the trail, but his hiking poles had gotten locked inside the vestibule of the bar area of the hotel, and no one would be there until 11 o’clock to let him in. So there he waited. Dude, a hiker from Georgia who is completing a hike from last year, was sitting on the bench waiting for a ride to Trail Days in Damascus, VA. I asked Dude if he had any tips for handling the rocks torquing my feet. He said that he keeps his hips loose, and allows them to rotate as he’s kind of going over the rocks. The last time I remember consciously doing anything with my hips was the first couple of days when I started this journey, when my hip muscles were very tight and painful. I tried to walk like a race walker, shifting with an over exaggerated wiggle, trying to relieve the discomfort. It didn’t, but at this point I'm willing to try anything to relieve the pain when I hit the rocks. If I can absorb the shock with my hips rather than my feet, I certainly would be better off. Every time I hit the rocks, I feel like I sprain my feet over and over again. 
Dorothy, Roaming Embassador showed up and sat down for a minute and then took off. When I was done with my feet, I put my pack on and took off. As I went down the sidewalk, I was looking at the map on my phone to make sure I was headed toward the trail, then SPLASH! I had stepped in a hole in the sidewalk filled with water and soaked my boots! I wasn't even half a block away from the Doyle Hotel. So much for the work I did all night, getting my boots and socks dry! 
Even though my feet were wet, it was a nice walk through town and crossing the bridge over the Susquehanna River. Then the trail led up and into the forest. There was a steep climb that kept going up, then turned into a big rock scramble. I love rock scrambles but it is more difficult when carrying a backpack. I went up, down, over, and through the large boulders until coming out on the other side. I stopped at Clarks Ferry Shelter to get water as there was no water sources for 6 miles until the next shelter. At the next shelter, it’s 300 steps down to the water. I learned my lesson about climbing down a steep trail to get my first night on the trail at Garvey shelter. I don't want to experience that again, so I’m hauling water from Clark shelter. Dorothy showed up before I left the shelter. She's staying there for the night and wondering who her shelter companions will be. We both figured it would be the 60'ish Sibs, three sisters that we saw in town. I’ve seen them on and off for the last couple of days, and they were at Darlington shelter the night I stayed there. Dorothy is looking forward to having them as shelter companions tonight. I continued on got to Peter's Mountain Shelter when it was nearly dark. Most everyone was in bed. I wandered around looking for a tent site, stopping by the shelter for a moment. I grabbed a hunter sausage stick and trail mix, quickly eating and put my food in the bear box. As I put my food in the box, I could smell the distinct smell of marijuana coming from somewhere, but it didn’t appear to be outside the shelter. There was nobody standing outside the shelter. I took my pack and found a tent spot next to a hiker sleeping in a hammock. She was still awake and we quietly talked for a minute. I pitched my tent, threw my gear inside, and started prepping for a good nights sleep. I came across a bag of trail mix that was in a bag where it wouldn’t normally be. In my haste to get out of the motel to catch the shuttle in town, I had thrown the trail mix into a different bag because my food back was already packed. I had to get up and go back to the bear box one more time. I certainly didn't want to entice a bear to join me in my tent. I could again smell marijuana and I saw no one mingling outside the shelter where people would normally smoke. I wondered if they were smoking in the shelter, but it was of no concern to me, as I was sleeping in my tent.
My feet were throbbing, and I couldn’t go to sleep right away. I checked the hike for the next day, trying to determine how far I might be able to go, but up to this point I’ve learned that the distance is totally dependent on how your body feels, and how the trail and weather conditions are. Despite my aching feet, wet socks, and wet boots...I am happy.","Duncannon, PA
","Peters Mountain Shelter, PA","May 17, Thu",10.90
River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592913,"I woke up sometime between 6:00 and 6:15. I laid there for a bit, stretching my feet and calves and listening to other people begin to stir. I finally started packing up my things to change my clothes at 6:30. As I came out of my tent I looked over next to me and was delighted to see Field Trip! I excitedly exclaimed his name and we greeted each other with a big hug. We talked about the Lady's Slippers that he was able to see on the trail. It was the one thing that he really wanted to see while hiking, and he’d seen several. We chatted for a bit, then I went to get my food bag. He finished packing and took off, knowing that we would see each other get down the trail. Thumper and Puddles were in the shelter packing their belongings while I ate my breakfast. Steady, who I hadn’t met yet, was also there and RX was organizing his gear on the deck of the shelter. Puddles and Thumper slept in the shelter instead of pitching a tent, and were treated to the smell of cigarette and marijuana smoke from someone who thought smoking near the opening of the shelter was “outside”. Now I know why I smelled the smoke and didn’t see anyone “outside”.
As I packed up, Ibex and I chatted. She had also come in late the night before, arriving shortly before me, and slept in a hammock near me. She was doing a flip-flop hike out of Roanoke and started in April. She finished packing and left. 
As I hit the trail today, it was cool and overcast. It was nice not to have rain. It was perfect weather for hiking. Perfect days for hiking don’t occur every day. According to some sources, it only happens about 20% of the time on the AT.  The rest of the time it’s raining, hot, cold, etc. The trail was also better to hike on, with more dirt trail, with some sections of rocks. The rocks grabbed my feet like they normally do, torquing them, and occasionally grabbing my trekking poles, but today was a good day. I tried the loose hip wiggle on the rocks like Dude suggested, but suspect I wasn't loose enough to go with the flow of the rocks shifting my hips to absorb the shock of the rocks.
I noticed a very small snake less than a foot long, with a diameter smaller than my pinky finger. I took a quick picture of it and headed up the hill to a rocky exposed ridge. After seeing the snake, I was thinking about how it was overcast, and the air was somewhat cool, so there probably wouldn’t be any snakes up on the ridge I was climbing up to. As I made my way along the ridge, with rocks to the right and left of me, a large black and silver snake caught my eye to the left. It was about the height of my head and approximately 3-4 feet left of the trail. He really didn’t seem too concerned with my presence, although he definitely was aware of my presence. I didn’t hear a rattle, but assumed it was rattlesnake. The trail passed where the snake was, and even though he didn't seem concerned, I didn't want to trigger him, and decided to take a detour on some rocks below the trail. I took some photos and a quick video, then made my way down the rocks and bypassed his location. He looked to be approximately 4-5 feet long and at least 1 1/2 inches in diameter. So far I’ve observed three snakes and I’ve heard one rattle at me. I have to look up the spiritual meaning of snakes. I have looked at animals as a spirit guide over the last few years. I never really thought about it until several years ago deer started appearing everywhere in my life. I saw them in fields, in the highway median near Metro Airport grazing,and in my backyard. They ran in front of my car causing me to slam on my brakes or swerve to miss them. One day I almost hit some deer and when I got home there were deer in my backyard. One of my coworkers told me that the deer had a message for me. Apparently I wasn’t listening. He had a book about animals as spirit guides and looked up the deer. There was a lot of information about the meaning, but what stuck with me the most was that I needed to be gentle with myself, and not so hard and critical. With whatever I had going on in my life at the time, it made total sense. Ever since then, when animals show up, especially animals that I don’t normally see, such as fox and eagles, I look it up to see what the meaning is. It always coincides with what I have going on in my life.  
Today brought good hiking with nice trails. There were some ups and downs and climbs. A typical hiking day. I also enjoyed cold spring water today, stopping a couple of times to soak my feet and change my socks. I was headed toward Yellow Springs Campsite, and on my way, I came across Steady, the woman I met earlier in the morning when I was eating breakfast. We Chatted for a little bit as we both walked up the trail and I asked her where she was from and she told me Oklahoma. I asked where she was camping for the night she said she wanted to stop at the next campsite, but was almost out of water. There were no sources of water listed before the next campsite, so she figured she would have to go to the second campsite. We chatted a little longer, then I took off. Shortly after hiking on, I found trickle of water running across the trail. Most people don’t have the means to gather such a small trickle, but I did. I stopped and pulled out my water collection bag and laid it down under the trickle to collect water. A short time later Steady came up. I told her I was trying to get some water for her if she wanted to try to fill up. I gathered water, about 16 ounces at a time and poured it into her water bag and she filtered it into her water containers. Once she had sufficient water, I headed out. She was very happy as her ankles were sore and she was ready to stop. My last stop before I camped was Yellow Springs Campsite where several of my ""trail family"" were camping for the night. RX, T-Bird, Puddles, Thumper, and Field Trip were there. 
A couple miles later, I came upon a stream where Ed, a hard of hearing gentleman, who camped next to me the night before, was getting water. I waved at him and he flag me down. He asked how far the next campsite was and I told him 1.2 miles, but several people from the night before would be at 1.7 miles at Yellow Springs. He said 1.7 was too far, but was hoping to camp with Field Trip, who he appeared to have bonded with at camp the day before. He also asked about a water source. I checked my app and I told him there was no water source at the campsite he was looking to stay at. My last stop before I camped was Yellow Springs Campsite, several of my ""trail family"" were camping for the night. RX, T-Bird, Puddles, Thumper and Field Trip we’re there. I chatted with them and showed them video and photos of the snake while getting a snack and changing out my socks. I signed the registration book and was packing up to head out and down the trail and Ed was coming into camp! I told Field Trip that Ed was hoping to catch up with him. I'm glad he was able to. I left with 5 miles left to get to Rausch Gap Shelter. Since it was such a great day of hiking, I had decided to keep going. I had a resupply box waiting at the post office, and with the next day being Saturday, I had limited time to get it. It would give me 4 miles to hike in the morning instead of 9, and a much better chance to get my box, instead of waiting until Monday. 
I got into Rausch Gap just before dusk. It was my biggest mileage day so far, with perfect hiking conditions, and the motivation of a resupply box waiting for me. Ibex, Lorax, and Cody Coyote were at the shelter. Ibex had set up her hammock at the tent sites before the shelter. I had dinner and found out there was no bear box at camp. I went back to the tent site, put on my headlamp, set up my tent, then found a limb to hang my food on. The tree was at the edge of a steep hill, but plenty of flat ground to stand on to hang my bag. I stood back, did a few practice swings with my rock sack, filled with rocks, then let it go. I heard a sound on the ground, going toward the right, and did not see the rock sack go toward the limb. I pulled the nearly weightless rope toward me, and when I got to the end I found a carabiner...with no rock sack. I walked around the edge of the hill, with my headlamp on bright, looking for the blue rock sack that escaped the rope. It was only my second time using it. The first time I used it, it worked fine. Apparently the carabiner wasn't attached well to the rock sack. I searched and search and couldn't find it. I walked to Ibex's hammock and asked her what she did with her food bag. She had hung it on the shelter ropes as Lorax had apparently suggested. I walked back up to the shelter and hung my bag. I climbed into my tent, checked the weather, and saw it would be 100% chance of rain when I had planned on getting up in the morning. I was trying to reserve a hotel in town, for the next day, but had a poor cell signal. I knew there were few hotels available as Thumper and Puddles had been looking to get one and not having much luck. I texted Tressa and asked her to check on a hotel for me. She found one, but had questions and asked me to call. I tried to call, but it wouldn't go through. She tried to call me and couldn't get through, so we texted our way through the details of the hotel reservation, with her getting the last room available at a Comfort Inn.

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592915,"I got up at 6:00 so I could get to the post office. Just as promised by the forecast, it was raining. I hiked 4 miles. It would normally take me two hours, but this morning it took me three hours 15 minutes. The 4 miles this morning was more difficult than the 18 I hiked yesterday, when the stars were aligned with a nice cool breeze, cooperative trail, and my feet feeling great. I was strong and my confidence grew with each step that I could complete 18 miles. This morning was a struggle to go four miles. It was raining and I had my umbrella up, attached to my shoulder strap. The trail was covered with water. Before I started to hike this morning, I had pulled out my gloves and rain mitts because my hands were cold. I put them in an accessible location, but had put on my pack and started hiking before I realized I hadn't put them on. I tried to keep hiking, but my hands were too cold and wet to continue without covering them. I checked all my pockets and everywhere I could think of to find my gloves with no luck. I finally found a semi-dry boulder to set my pack on, and as soon as I swung it off my back, I saw my gloves and mitts, neatly tucked into a pocket on either side of my sit pad, located in the lower back area of my pack. I had put them where I could easily reach while hiking, but forgot I had put them there. It was a pretty miserable hike. It was cold and raining, with trees down, and a controlled burn area that was still smoldering and smelled like smoke. Today I kept thinking ""I just want to hike"". I would then hear another voice say ""You ARE hiking"". It just wasn't my ideal conditions, slogging along in the rain with water flowing down the trail. I kept thinking about my trail family who would be hiking 9 miles today instead of 4 miles, as they had camped further back. The trail went through an area that was the Village of Rausch Gap from 1828 - 1910. The peak population was just over 1,000, but the coal mining industry there was not productive, and the railroad removed its operations in 1872, negating the need for the railroad equipment repair that was located there.  
As I hiked through the controlled burn area, a bright red bird caught my eye against the dark, bleak background of rain and burnt forest. It kept moving quickly from tree to tree, barely giving me an opportunity to get a good look at it. I would later find out it was a Vermilion Flycatcher. It was a beautiful, bright red bird, with black wings and a black eye band. No matter how miserable I might be while out here, there is something every day that makes me smile and glad to be here, doing what I'm doing. Today it was the Vermilion Flycatcher.
I had to get to the post office by noon in order to get my package. Within half mile of the road I tried to call a shuttle and got an answering machine. I left a message and called the second number listed for the same service. That person was currently in Carlisle. I checked Uber and there were no cars available. I figured if I got to the road, I would eventually get a ride, either from Uber or a passerby who felt sorry for a wet hiker. Uber came available and I decided not to take a chance on missing picking up my supply box so I confirmed. Jonathan was the driver, a very pleasant young man who had been an Uber driver for three months. It appeared that he was still figuring out the system, trying to follow the map as he passed by the street where the post office was located in Jonestown, and kept going until I told him he needed to turn around and go back. The shuttle driver had called me back and I asked him about a good place to eat in Jonestown. He didn't have any suggestions. I asked about a place near the Comfort Inn and he suggested McDonald’s. I told him I wasn’t really interested in McDonald’s and he suggested Moose's LZ. When I mentioned it to the Uber driver, who previously had no opinion about a restaurant, he lit up and said it was a great place to eat. I added Moose's to my Uber itinerary. This choice was confirmed by the Postal Service clerk, and a customer in the post office.
The big deck burger is an eight ounce burger with bacon, lettuce, tomato, sautéed onions, sautéed mushrooms, and bbq sauce. I had a cup of coffee to warm up before my food arrived and a Yards Brawler to wash down the burger. Conscientious of my body odor, I sat at a table in the corner of the dining room, as far away from people as I could get. I would’ve preferred to sit in the bar room area where sports were being broadcasted on the several tv screens, but I didn’t want to overwhelm people trying to eat with my hiker stench. The restaurant began to fill up, with many customers from the local military base. Two young military ladies, Jackie and Brittany, sat at the table next to me. They were both in the medical field for the army. We had a nice conversation throughout our meals. Brittany recommended a restaurant in Cumberland Gap, TN of which she knew the owner. I noted it, and they left before I finished my lunch.
When I was done eating, I went to the bar area and selected a couple micro brew bottles for later at the hotel, and put them in my pack. I got my resupply box, and began the 1.4 mile walk to the hotel. I had gone about 2/10 of a mile when a large white pick up pulled off to the side of the road in front of me and stopped. As I approached, I saw it was a Pennsylvania DCNR truck. The female driver offered me a ride, which I gladly accepted. We had a nice conversation during the short ride to the Comfort Inn. Another Trail Angel, which I am very grateful for. When I arrived at the hotel, Puddles, Thumper, T-Bird, and RX had just arrived in an Uber. We were all able to check in early. I told them about Moose’s LZ and that I was willing to go back for another meal with them. We all got busy with our chores before dinner.  
It’s different arriving at hotel or hostel than it was at the beginning of the hike three weeks ago. It started off as a reprieve when arriving, chores were somewhat secondary at the beginning. I felt like I needed rest when I arrived and, other than laundry and getting a good meal, everything else was secondary. Washers and dryers are at a premium because they are usually in demand by other hikers. I needed rest, but would scramble to get the rest of my chores done before I checked out. Now there is a clear process at each stop when amenities are available. Shower, laundry, clean and put gear out to dry, eat, resupply food, back wash water filter, wash items such as freshette and water collection bag, sort food and snacks into daily bags, and tweak the organization of gear and supplies. An example of a change I made to my re-organizing is that I now have a “sock bag” instead of keeping socks in my clothes bag, which gets packed away each morning. The sock bag remains accessible throughout the day so I can change to dry socks when I stop for breaks. I keep nail clippers, anti-friction lube, and leukotape in the bag. I re-apply lube at every stop that I remove my boots and socks. I have gotten one small blister since I started, but I knew I was going to get it, because I didn’t want to stop on the steep hill coming into Duncannon. 
After arriving in Lickdale/Lebanon and began to complete chores, every was hungry, so we went to Moose’s LZ. I had another Big Deck burger and Brawler. We left there and went to grocery store, then back to the hotel. Puddles and Thumper still needed to do laundry. Everyone was drying their gear as it had rained during the night, and all morning. Puddles was using a blow dryer to dry her tent, which was hanging over the shower curtain rod in the bathroom. She and Thumper were sharing a room, which was like a sauna with all the wet gear and their heater turned on high. I shared my beers with RX and T-Bird. RX was very happy, as he had stayed at the hotel when the rest of us went out to dinner and the grocery store.
I organized my food, sharing a few items with my trail family. There is very little down time when coming off the trail, unless a zero day is taken. Even then, there is very little time to relax.","Rausch Gap Shelter, PA

I didn’t sleep much at the hotel. I updated a couple of days of journals. I tried to eat breakfast which wasn’t cooperating with me and took Imodium to get relief. Puddles and T-Bird took off early. Once I felt better, Thumper, RX and I got an Uber back to the trail.  The trail was reasonably nice and a pleasant hike in the beginning, with a very dicey water crossing over a fast moving creek. There was a log was over the fast moving water, about 1 1/2 feet across, and approx 20’ - 25’ long, but oddly shaped, with a hump in the middle that was about half the length of the entire log. The last 6-8 feet angled up, with the end going over the top of another log to step down on. It wouldn’t have been so bad, but it was wet and slick, and with the rushing water below, it wasn’t anyplace you wanted to fall into. I got on the log and straddled the hump with one foot on each side. There was just enough room for the width of my boot. I shuffled my feet along, maintaining contact with the log.  When I got to the angle where the log went up, I found it was too slick to walk on and was afraid I would slip off. I tossed my trekking poles to the ground, and bent over onto my hands and bear crawled to the end of the log at an upward angle, then climbed down to the lower log. Whew! I waited for Thumper who had made a quick stop along the trail behind me. I wanted to make sure she had moral support to make the crossing. She came around the corner and saw the challenge before her and stopped to analyze it. I described how I had crossed it. She gathered herself and climbed onto the log, stopping briefly saying “I’m having a little anxiety over this”. She then shuffled across, bear crawled, and climbed down. We then continued on, Thumper with a faster pace than I, disappeared. After the short bit of pleasant, flat hiking, the trail led into the forest at an incline. The weather forecast called for 84 degrees and it was 68 when I went into the trees. I started going up, sweat pouring off me. Even though the temperature was relatively cool, it felt like a tropical rainforest. The trail continued to climb, getting steeper toward the top. It took me 52 minutes to complete the climb. It was the hardest part of the trail that I had experienced since going for water on my first day at Garvey Shelter. I think it was the combination of the steepness, along with the humidity. I'm sure I was also somewhat dehydrated from my intestinal issues before leaving the hotel. I was nearly in tears, ready to just stop and sit down. I talked to Tressa on the phone for most of the climb. She talked to me about work, home, the gym, anything she could think of, which helped keep my mind off what I was doing. When I got to the top, there were rocks! It was a long day getting into the 501 Shelter. The trail ranged from a dirt path to sections of rocks that torqued my feet. Some sections were great and hiking was smooth and painless, others were tedious and hard on my feet, sometimes getting sharp pains shooting through them. Puddles had texted me about how great the trail was past William Penn Shelter. I had gotten to a smooth section of the trail before that, and moved along really well. What she had failed to tell me (a lie by omission) that there was another section of rocks. When I got to them, it took some of the wind out of my sails, but I was glad she didn't tell me about them. After William Penn, it was four miles to 501 Shelter. Puddles told me about some trail magic just before the shelter, but by the time I got there, the gatorade that was there was gone, but I did get an ice cold bottle of water, which I was grateful for. 
The shelter was enclosed on all four sides, with several bunks inside. It's also unique in that food can be ordered and delivered there. There were two bunks left when I arrived. After claiming an upper bunk, I ate dinner, and went to bed.","PA 443 Green Point, PA

I returned to the trail this morning with Buddha via Uber.  We had stayed at a hotel last night, with Buddha’s brother leaving the trail and going home today.  I had done 15.1 miles yesterday, and 18.9 the day before.  Buddha took off, as he wanted to get some bigger miles in today. My feet were very sore and I only made it two miles before stopping at Fitzgerald Falls to soak them in icy cold water. They were still feeling the pain of the Pennsylvania rocks, with nary a minute to recover. I called the hotel where Puddles was staying tonight to make a reservation, but they were booked. I asked to get on a cancellation list and the owner took my number.  He mentioned he was waiting for Christy (Puddles) to come in and I told him I knew her.  He also said something about another hiker, who I didn’t know. He said Christy had the “large” room with three beds, and maybe I could stay with her. I contacted her later and we agreed to share the room.
After spending quite a bit of time at the falls, I reluctantly put my boots back on my swollen, sore feet. I had an ascent facing me and slowly started my climb for over a mile to Mombasha High Point in Sterling State Forest. As the day went on, I realized New York was turning out to be much tougher than expected. Puddles had sent me a text yesterday about how “Badass” New York was, as she was at least a day ahead of me. It was a rough day with my mileage dropping from the two previous days. There was some trail magic from Susan and The Hikerman, who were leaving several gallon size bottles of COLD spring water near every roadway.  With all the climbs in the heat today, the water was greatly appreciated for refills. I did have a chance to meet them at one of the roadsides, and they were wonderful.  Thank you for trail magic! 
I arrived at Elk Park (also called Elk Penn) and walked to a shady spot in the parking lot, where I dropped my pack.  There were three cars in the lot.  An occupied car was parked in the shade, then pulled ahead to my location. It was Chongo, who I had met on the trail near High Point, NJ and his uncle Rob. Chongo was getting picked up for a couple zero days. They offered me a piece of pizza and a beer, which I gladly accepted. We chatted for a while, then they took off while I waited for my Uber. 
As the Uber driver headed to the motel, Puddles texted me that she was at Palisades Parkway, and could not summon an Uber, due to her weak to non-existent phone signal. She had hiked more miles than she wanted, because she didn’t have cell service at an earlier exit point from the trail. Currently, she could only text. I asked my Uber driver, if he was going past her location, and he advised he was. I asked if he could pick her up on the way back, and he said he couldn’t, he didn’t want to get fired. I then tried to bribe him with cash, an offer which he also refused. Between texts with Puddles, the conversation with my driver was not very interesting. I was trying to explain a nearly 2200 mile backpacking trip, to someone who didn’t know what a tent or camping was. I spent most of my time explaining where I sleep at night. I’m quite certain he did not have a full understanding of what a tent was before the ride was over.  By the time I got to the motel, Puddles said there was a pay phone where she was, and asked for a taxi number, or for me to call one. I went into the motel, where the owner greeted me, thinking I was Puddles. I explained her plight, and he decided to pick her up. I asked if I could put my pack in the room and opened the door to one double bed, in a cute, but tiny room. It wasn’t the large room with three beds. This isn’t going to work” I thought to myself, and told “Grandpa” as he referred to himself, that I would have to stay someplace else. There was miscommunication earlier, and he thought I knew the person staying in the large room. We found Puddles and returned to the motel. I walked across the street, checked in to the Holiday Inn Express and contacted Sugar Foot, who was back after taking a week off, returning to the trail tomorrow. He joined Puddles and I for dinner. It was nice to catch up with him, as we hadn’t seen each other since leaving Harpers Ferry. I returned to the hotel with Puddle’s laundry and gave my best to Sugar Foot. I got our laundry done and into the dryer, then fell asleep.","NY 17A / Greenwood Lake
",Arden Valley Rd / Elk Park,"Jun 08, Fri",12.30
River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593863,"I woke up at 5:30 this morning and sleep walked to get our laundry out of the dryer. I had set a timer but likely shut it off and went back to sleep.  As the elevator door opened, I was cheerfully greeted by the desk clerk, who was sitting in the breakfast area. He invited me to have breakfast. I wasn’t in a mood to speak, only wanting to retrieve clothes and go back to bed. I thanked him, got the clothes, and slept in until 730. I had to go to the post office this morning to pick up two packages, since my hike yesterday took too long to get to the post office before closing. I had a resupply box I had mailed from Jodi’s, and repair tape for my tent to pick up. I discovered at Jodi’s house there were some small holes in some of the mesh in the end of my tent.  I sorted through my belongings and selected several small items to send home that I haven’t used. I showered, ate breakfast, filled my hydration bag with ice, and headed to the Bear Mountain Bridge Motel where Puddles was staying, and where I would be staying tonight. She was taking a zero day, so I left my backpack in her room, took the small bag to ship home and headed to the post office.  I got my packages and opened the resupply box, took a few item out, and added it to what I had already selected from my pack, and put them in a box to ship home. I headed back to the motel, prepped my pack for a slack pack day by taking out everything I didn’t need, and summoned an Uber. As I loaded my pack in the back car, I noticed a military style ball cap. I asked the driver if he served in the military and he said he did. I thanked him for his service. The driver was David and we instantly hit it off. Unlike my driver from yesterday who I couldn’t even explain what a tent was, let alone backpacking, David was very outdoorsy. He talked about backpacking in Europe while he was in the military, and some other endeavors, then told me some stories about people he had dropped off for hikes who were not prepared with basics such as water.
I explained the situation Puddles had yesterday with not being able to get an Uber because of the lack of a phone signal. David gave me his personal number in case we got into a simIlar jam.  We passed a doe and a couple fawns along the way. He dropped me off at the park and I headed out. It started out as a sunny day and became overcast. There were a few climbs and a couple special challenges today. The first one was the famous “lemon squeezer” a narrow path, between two large boulders, barely wide enough to fit a body through, let alone a body and a backpack. The narrow opening also leans precariously to the left, which throws your balance off, forcing you to lean into the boulder to the left. In addition to walking at an odd angle to the left, you have to use your hand or hands to keep pushing yourself off the boulder. Since I was slack packing today, my pack wasn’t as full as it normally is and I was able to keep it on. Many backpackers are forced to take their pack off to get through. I squeezed through, then was faced with a straight climb up a rock face approximately 10-12 feet up, with the rocks jutting out. The rocks were at an angle out, that if I fell, I would likely fall onto my back.  This was the “white blaze” route. There was also a blue blaze route as an alternative with a sign and arrow pointing to the left that said “Easy Way” which went around the rock wall. I decided to investigate to see if I could climb it. The left side had a tree growing in and around the rocks. with a small open area under the trunk that I could probably crawl through. The challenge was to get upon the rock sticking out underneath it. There were no good grips or footholds that would work for me, and a further fall down than if I attempted from the right. The rocks on the right also had more options for gripping, but getting up and over the rock jutting out would be difficult with my pack on. I climbed up on a rock to get as high as I could, and blindly tossed my trekking poles up. Then I held my pack over my head and put it up on the rock as best as I could, with the short reach I had. Because I couldn’t push my pack back further, it took up some of the space I would have available for climbing up on the rock. I found a couple of handholds and a foothold, and tried a couple of practice push offs to test my hand and foot placement. Then I pushed off and pulled myself up and over the rock ledge. I was ecstatic! It was fun and reminded me of things like this I would have done in my youth. I put my pack on, and with renewed energy, headed down the trail. The trail was much more forgiving today, with not nearly as many steep climbs as yesterday. The weather was nice and there were a lot of day hikers out. Everyone was friendly and several people inquired about my hike, asking if I was a thru hiker.  Five miles from the  end of my hike, I had a really good pace going, but was met with a couple of steep climbs and descents that would slow me down a bit, but I was rewarded with some nice views, including a distant view of the New York City skyline. I reached my destination of Palisades Parkway, an interstate commuter route with cars speeding by. There were two lanes of traffic going each direction, with a median divider. It was a Saturday evening, so it wasn’t as busy as a weekday, which causes crossing it like a real life “frogger” game. It’s hard to believe there is no bridge here for pedestrians.  
I walked about a quarter mile to the visitor center/bookstore to call an Uber.  Two young ladies, I would guess in their early 20’s, also came from the trail. They had been given bad directions to Bear Mountain, and were a long way from their car. It was late in the day and they did not have adequate water or headlamps to get them back. I offered to let them hop into my Uber ride and see if I could get the driver to drop them off in the way back to my motel. The Uber driver was awesome and dropped them at their car on the way back. I had a great blackened salmon salad and Yuengling for dinner before turning in.  Puddles and I were now at the same starting point beginning tomorrow.","Arden Valley Rd / Elk Park

6/10 - 10.2 Hemlock Springs Campsite (Tent)
Today Puddles and I began hiking together again. It was a weekend, with day hikers and tourists taking over the trail. We were to go over Bear Mountain in New York today, which many day hikers had warned us about how difficult it would be. 
Today we hiked 10 miles. It was a leisurely day going over mountain. Puddles and I took the time to repair the mesh netting in my tent before we left the motel. We ate breakfast down the street at a local nondescript small restaurant/convenience store serving breakfast sandwiches and fresh coffee. We Ubered to Palisades Parkway and marched against the grain of speeding cars coming at us along the parkway. We couldn't walk fast enough to get off the parkway and back on the trail. The trail wasn’t too terribly bad, but everyone have warned us that we still had to go over ""bear mountain"". After what we’ve already hiked through in New York I couldn't imagine what the mountain would be like. 
Throughout the day we ran into several day hikers. Because it was the weekend, everyone was out getting away from the city trying to enjoy nature. There were couples, families, groups of friends. We talk to several day hikers, some were fascinated by what we were doing, and others who didn’t have any idea what we were doing and probably thought we were homeless. Bear Mountain is a very popular area and we found ourselves marching in single file with streams of day hikers once we got there. During the hike in we came across several trails that intersected the Appalachian Trail. Many people were out hiking the local trails. We came across several hikers who were lost, and we did our best to try to redirect them where they needed to go, but we weren't familiar with the local trails, and couldn’t access any maps our phones due to the week cell signal, except for our Guthook AT App. It was amazing how many people were out hiking that didn't even have a bottle of water with them, and were lost. We had several interesting questions during the day which started off with ""How far is the parking lot?"". This was asked by a young man who was hiking with what appeared to be his girlfriend. They had no water and I'm guessing they had started on a local loop trail, then got off from it and ended up on the A.T. We did not pass a parking lot on our way in. Puddles and I started to have a conversation with him, then his girlfriend came up and said ""We're fine"", so we moved on. I'm not sure how the rest of their day went, I can only suspect. We had also run into a group of women who were hiking and were off track. We were able to help them figure out where to go to get back on the trail they were hiking.
We got to bear mountain and had a variety of trails ranging from paved, to crush stone, to well formed rectangular rock steps, not like the rock stairs that we are used to on the trail that vary greatly in size and shape. Everything was geared towards day hikers and tourists. We had small goals throughout the day. Make it to the vending machine at Bear Mountain. Make it to the lake and concession stand. Make it to the zoo, which the trail went through. We didn't make it to the zoo because it closed before we arrived. The last goal was to cross the Hudson River and get to a campsite. 
On the way up the mountain, we saw a flock of birds eating berries off of a tree on one of the overlooks. We didn’t know what kind of birds they were. I wish I knew more about the birds, flowers, and other natural things I see along the trail. Regardless, I still enjoy being out here in nature. We ran into three young hikers Eric, Andrew, and Stuff Sack. They had just come out of a shelter to the area where the birds were eating berries. We chatted with them for a few minutes then they took off. They were very nice young men.During the day we stopped at a scenic overlook on Bear Mountain for lunch. As we approached it, I was ahead of Puddles and barely visible over-the-top of a climb, I could see a bench that was perfectly positioned to eat lunch and have a great view. As soon as I saw it, I hiked as fast as I could. There was no way a day hiker coming from the other side was going to beat me to that bench today. We usually sit on the ground, a rock, or a log to eat. This was a bench, with a back to lean on! I made there and claimed it! Victory! Just moments before day hikers came from the other side. Puddles came up and was delighted to see our comfy accommodations for lunch. We relaxed and ate our lunch, enjoying the view and the people watching. A couple of day hikers were stalking us for the bench, but there was no way we were leaving until we were done. We’ve been hiking since West Virginia and we earned our right to sit on the bench for as long as we wanted to eat our lunch. During the day we ran into Dozer, who we had met at Cabela’s, and his brother Napper, along with a female flip-flop hiker who started in Harpers Ferry, Riddler. When we arrived at Hessian Lake, we ran into volunteers who maintain the trail. George jokingly asked us if we wanted a beer. Of course we said yes, and of course he didn’t have any. We chatted with him for a while then headed toward the concession stand, walking along the lake as families were enjoying themselves grilling food, using paddle boats on the lake, and fishing. I wasn't sure if I was going to eat anything at the concession stand, but I couldn’t resist. I had a Philadelphia water ice, Nathan‘s hotdog, french fries, and got a root beer for Puddles as part of my ""value meal"". We sat at a picnic table relaxed for a few moments with Napper, who had been looking for his brother. His phone was dead so he tried to call using my phone with no luck. We left there and crossed the Hudson River. As we were crossed, we both saw a steep mountain ahead, which we both knew we would have to climb in order to get to the campsite. The markings near the bridge at the Hudson River for the trail were a little confusing, and we ended up walking on the opposite side of the road from where we should have been. This caused us to have to cross busy traffic on the other end. I took a look at Guthook and saw the very steep climb we had ahead of us. We went up the very steep, half mile climb slowly. Puddles had noticed someone had rated it as a ""moderate"" climb, but we felt it was much more difficult than that. Bear Mountain was nothing compared to this. The only thing difficult about Bear Mountain was landing on the stone stops which jarred our legs with every step down. We ran into another day hiker on the steep climb up, who was very interested in what we were doing. She posed the comment/question about the A.T. ""The trail isn't steep, is it?"" 
Another interesting comment/question we had during the day from a volunteer at Bear Mountain who was trying to sound knowledgeable about a flip flop hike was ""so you're hiking half the trail?"". I clarified that we were hiking the WHOLE trail, but doing the northern half first.
We made it to camp and were delighted to find the three young men that we had met earlier in the day, Eric, Andrew, and Stuff Sack. They had already set up camp and were very welcoming when we arrived. We set up, ate dinner, then Puddles gave a lesson on the PCT method of hanging food bags to the three young man. Darkness came quickly, and so did sleep.","Palisades Interstate NY

Now I have almost 600 miles behind me, and have a better idea of what I’m doing. The nervousness and anxiety I had in the beginning are gone. Now I’m focused on finishing what I started. There’s a part of me that has some guilt about not being at home to help with household chores and caring for pets, but I also know this is temporary, and a once in a lifetime experience It’s an excellent transition for me into retirement, to free myself of cynicism, and restore my faith in humanity. 
I enjoyed spending time with friends, Tressa, and the cat menagerie. There were a lot of things I wanted to get done at home, but there just wasn’t enough time. 
One of my cats did his best to try and convince me to stay at home by spooning with me in the morning, but I wiggled out from behind him and tucked him in, with his head on my pillow. Tressa dropped me off at the airport and I flew to Manchester where Puddles and Brian picked me up. We had a nice dinner with their niece Laura and boyfriend, Aaron, then headed home to Puddle’s house, where I organized and packed my gear and food box I had shipped to myself. Other than my aching knee not being fully recovered from hiking before the days off, I was ready to return to the trail.","

Brian drove us to the trail head where we left off at Rte 9 near Bennington, VT.  Thumper was rejoining is on the hike and was in the parking lot. She had been hiking while we were off, then stayed at a friend’s house. Her friend brought her to the trailhead. Puddles sister-in-law, Becky and her husband Dave were also there. They had trail magic which I took advantage of before getting back on trail. A banana and root beer.  Becky was joining us for a hike today. We said our goodbyes and off we went. We hiked 1.4 miles to Melville Nauheim Shelter...all uphill. We stopped at the shelter for some snacks and to take a break before Becky headed back down to the car. She had stashed some fresh muffins from the bakery in her daypack and offered them to us. Thumper and I devoured the morning glory and pumpkin muffins, which were delicious. When we were ready, Thumper, Puddles and I headed north while Becky headed south, back to the parking lot. It was really nice to spend time with her today, and share part of the journey with her.
The hiking was good today, going through the Glastenury Wilderness. The weather held out, even though it looked like it might rain at times. The trail was sometimes covered with pine needles or leaves, with rocks and roots interspersed. Occasionally I smelled the strong scent of balsam, and would deeply inhale to enjoy it to its fullest.
I have been having some issues with my right knee for a while, and even after taking five days off, it was not happy today. I was getting occasional sharp pain on my patella, and it still feels swollen in the joint, with a lack of mobility. I can bend it further than when I came off the trail, but the inability of it to bend adequately is effecting my ability to hike comfortably. I have ordered a brace, but I still need it to bend, something I will be working on with stretching of my entire lower body, and working on my IT band. Since I’m right side dominate, I think I’ve been subconsciously using my right leg for all the heavy lifting when I have big step ups. I’m going to focus on using my left leg for more of those big steps. I also having issues with a knot in my left shoulder blade and cramping of my left pectoral muscle. I had an adjustment and some body work while I was home and it feels much better. As I was hiking today, I started to feel the tightness coming on. There was no pressure on my shoulder pulling down, but I could feel my shoulder strap pulling back. I started thinking that my pec hasn’t been getting any type of exercise, it has simply been getting pulled back by my shoulder strap. I started to experiment with different techniques of using my trekking poles, focusing on using my pecs and lats more, instead of my triceps. I found a way to use them that relieved the cramping and tightness. This should help with the rest of my hike.
Throughout the afternoon, hikers were fist bumping me because Brian, Puddle’s husband, and Dave, Becky’s husband, were passing out trail magic (in the form of snacks and cold beverages). Some of them knew my name and called out as they approached me. They apparently recognized me from a photo Brian was showing. They would mention Puddles and I let them know she was up ahead. 
Thumper arrived at Goddard Shelter, which looked quite full. We looked at some tent sites, but the ones available weren’t very level. One hiker mentioned some nice campsites up the trail about a quarter mile. When Puddles arrived, we decided to explore the campsites, then realized they were up on Glastenbury Mountain near the fire tower. There was no water source there, so we got water from the source at the shelter and headed uphill. We arrived to find nice campsites next to the fire tower. It was breezy and getting cold. We arrived near sunset and were treated with a beautiful view of the sunset from the top of the tower. I lingered for a while, with the wind blowing hard and temperature dropping. I was cold, but made dinner and escaped into my tent, when I realized I forgot to pee. I braved the cold, and then dove back into my tent, where I bundled up in my sleeping quilt and finally got warm enough to fall sleep, listening to the wind blowing through the tops of the pine trees. It was a good first day back on the trail.","VT 9 / Bennington, VT

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597002,"I woke up to 41 degrees and breezy. We had talked about getting up to see the sunrise, but no one wanted to come out of their tents. Once I got my sleeping quilt situated around my sleeping pad last night, I was toasty warm. I have an insulated sleeping pad, a 10 degree quilt, and a light sleeping bag liner. So far, I’ve been happy with my system. If it’s warm, I use the liner, if it’s cold, I use the liner and quilt.
As I was waking up and preparing mentally to face the morning air, I put my clothes under my sleeping bag liner to warm them up. I was hoping the sun would warm up my tent a bit, but it wasn’t happening this morning. Hunger and a full bladder finally forced me to vacate the comfort of my summer home. Puddles peeked through a small opening in her tent door and asked if she had to come out, then reluctantly did so. 
I emptied my tent, hung it over the the tower rungs in the sun to dry the dew, and ate breakfast. 
The weather was great, with clear skies and a cool breeze. Pine needles coated a lot of the trail, but so did the Vermont mud! There’s no way to get a hiking rhythm going with sections of mud. The strong recommendation for the mud is to walk through it so there is less damage to the vegetation.It’s difficult to force myself to walk through mud bogs that sometimes have industrial strength, suck your boots of your feet, suction power. I try to compromise a bit and tip toe around the edges, avoiding the vegetation, while keeping my boots on. Sometimes there are enough rocks in the mud that I can rock hop through it, but regardless, it is tedious navigating the mud all day. 
There were a couple of breaks today when Puddles, Thumper, and I had a snack or lunch together at Kid Gore Shelter and Story Spring Shelter. There was a Beaver Bog near Story Spring Shelter which had a beautiful reflection of the trees and sky, and a couple of limited views from higher elevations.
 I was behind Puddles and Thumper, which I normally am by 10-30 minutes. About a mile from our planned camping location, I came across the bridge at Black Brook. I saw Puddles and Thumper at a great campsite along the brook on other side and threw my arms up and said “it looks like home for the night”. I love it when we can score a great campsite, especially when it is next to water! I had dinner and was able to wash up in the brook and rinse out some clothes before going to bed. It’s a great bonus to have water to clean up with and get refreshed and rejuvenated. It was a great end to the day.

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597246,"It wasn’t nearly as cold this morning as yesterday, but I noticed my sleeping pad seemed to have less air in it than when I went to bed. It wasn’t completely deflated, and there were no obvious holes in it. I’ll pay closer attention to it to see if there’s any noticeable difference in the future. As I was finishing packing up, Puddles was ready to leave camp. She picked up her trekking poles and said “are you kidding me?” She had her trekking poles laying on the ground, and during the night, something had gnawed on the handles. Thumper and I both suspected it was a porcupine as we have both heard they are attracted to the salt from sweat, and will chew on gear left out to get the salt. Puddles was disappointed about her newly formed cork handles, but had no choice except to hike with them. 
Thumper and I chatted as we finished packing up, neither of us seeming to be in a hurry to leave camp. It was a great location and sleeping to the sound of the brook last night was soothing. 
It was another great day for hiking with clear skies and temperatures in a good range to hike comfortably. We summited Stratton Mountain, where there was a fire tower with beautiful views. I took off my boots and socks to air out and put on my camp shoes. Puddles, Thumper and I went up in the tower to check out the views. When we came back down, Buddha was there! I hadn’t seen him since Warwick NY. He had come off trail for bit, which is why I caught up with him. He was now sporting a kilt, which he highly recommended. There were a lot of day hikers coming up from a parking lot to the tower. After getting a snack and airing out boots, feet and socks, we took off. Puddles left and a few minutes later, I followed Thumper down a trail. After hiking downhill for about 5 minutes, Thumper was coming back toward me. I figured she forgot something, but she said, “we’re on the wrong trail”. It was the trail going to a parking lot for day hikers and tourists, not the AT. Fortunately, I only had to go 1/10 of a mile, but of course it was uphill. I turned around behind Thumper and climbed back up the hill to get on the AT.
Thumper is a faster hiker than I, and disappeared down the trail. Puddles was at Stratton Pond Shelter when we arrived, but was on her way out. I had stopped at the privy and was taking care of business when I heard her ask if I was in there. When I replied, she laughed because I have not yet used my trowel to take care of business in the woods. My timing has worked out so far, that I always make it to a shelter privy or forest service privy. It’s now become on ongoing joke about when my trowel will be christened.
I had a quick lunch and headed down the trail, passing by Stratton Pond. I stopped to take it in for a few moments, and continued on. 
Later in the afternoon, Puddles texted that she wasn’t feeling well and was stopping to rest. When I got to her location along the Winfall River, she thought it would be best for her to stay and not hike any further. She felt bad about not going as far as we thought we would, but I didn’t mind stopping. Then she showed me the campsite she had seen on the other side of the river she thought might work for Thumper and I. Thumper thought we could fit two tents on it, and I rock hopped across to check it out. It was an awesome site. It was on a little peninsula that jutted out where the river took a turn. It was a tight fit for two tents, but Thumper and I loved our home for the night. We set up camp and had dinner at Puddles' campsite, on the opposite side of the river before retiring for the night.

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597943,"I was hiking with Thumper and we ran into Grumpy just before Spruce Peak. I had heard Puddles and Thumper talk about him, as they had met him a while back. I hadn’t met him yet. He is very upbeat and energetic. We arrived at a parking lot on VT Rte 11/30!that leads to Manchester Center. Thumper and I split up from Grumpy and Puddles to hitchhike into town. Puddles and Grumpy got a ride fairly quickly. Thumper and I got a ride ride from Will in the back of a small pick up with a cap. Two other hikers squeezed in with us, and off we went. Will dropped us off at Price Chopper. We bought food and packed our food bags. I donned my laundry outfit (rain kilt and wind jacket) and headed to the laundromat with Puddles, Thumper, and my laundry. A restaurant was conveniently located across the street, so the three of us ate lunch with Grumpy. Puddles and I rotated with each other to finish the laundry while we ate. 
After sorting and repacking clothes, we split up to hitchhike back to the trail. Puddles and Grumpy immediately got a ride, while Thumper and I waited for about 30 cars. We got picked up by Tom, an army vet with an open bed pick up. Tom wants to hike the AT someday. After getting to the trailhead, he chatted with the four of us for a while. We headed up to Bromley Mountain, a ski resort that allows hikers to sleep in the warming hut during the summer. There is no water supply at Bromley,  so we had to stop so we had to stop over a mile from the mountain to get water to carry up. After filling my food bag from the store, it was the most weight I’ve had to carry. I’m guessing it was between 35-38 pounds, and the trail led straight up the ski slope. It was extremely windy at the top, nearly impossible to set up a tent. Puddles and I went into the warming hut where she discovered a “pantry” with no one in it. There were shelves, one of which was just shy of six feet long. She asked if I could fit on it, which I knew I could. There were shelves that went up from the shelf where I would sleep, a perfect place to slide my feet under. She dubbed me the “elf on the shelf”. I had a window next to me where I could see the stars. It was perfect. Puddles slept on the floor. After we got settled, I ate a kale salad and potato chips that I had packed up from the store. Fresh fruits and salad are something I crave out here. It’s a balance between getting fresh food and high calorie food to stay healthy. After dinner, I joined other hikers in the mountaintop to enjoy a spectacular sunset. It was a great end to the day.","Winhall River

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597979,"I slept pretty well on my shelf in the pantry. I could see the stars outside the window I was sleeping next to, and caught a glimpse of the sunrise in the morning. The wind blew strong all night, but was much calmer in the morning. Puddles didn’t sleep well, as she was not feeling well when she went to bed. She felt better this morning, hopefully it holds out.
I was eating breakfast as Grumpy was getting ready to leave. He was planning on going 17 miles. He invited Thumper to hike with him. She was thinking about doing higher mileage, but wasn’t sure about doing 17. She left before Grumpy did. Puddles closed the windows to the hut and left. I was about 10 minutes behind her and ran into Joe, who was hiking the Long Trail. The Long Trail is a 272 mile trail established in 1910 that runs from the Massachusetts-Vermont state line to Canada, crossing Vermont’s highest peaks. It is the oldest long distance hiking trail in the US, and the inspiration for the Appalachian Trail. The two trails run congruently for 100 miles in the southern third of the state. 
Joe and I chatted for a few minutes and I left. It was a beautiful morning as I descended from Bromley Mountain. The trail wasn’t as muddy as it has been. Along the way, a bird flew out in front of me, coming from what appeared to be a hole in the ground. Upon closer inspection, I saw a nest with eggs, on the ground, partially hidden by a moss covered rock, overhanging the trail. The bird flew into a nearby tree and starting scolding me for being to close to its nest. It appeared to be a black-eyed Junco. I took a few pictures and moved on. 
I haven’t been seeing many gray squirrels in Vermont. In the states prior, there have been hundreds of them. I’ve become accustomed to hearing them dashing through them leaves. There are many more evergreens in this area, so I suspect there isn’t a food source as readily available, such as acorns. I’ve really enjoyed the strong balsam fragrance from the evergreens.
I passed over Styles Peak and took a couple of quick photos and headed for Griffith Lake, where I could hear Puddles scream through the trees as she jumped in the lake. I made my way through the woods and also jumped in, enjoying the cool refreshing feeling, after hiking in the warmth of the day. After cooling off, I headed for Baker’s Peak which had beautiful, angled slabs of rock to walk up. I actually enjoyed walking up the rock formations, and had to keep stopping to look back at the views. I spent some time at the top, enjoying the views before moving on. Puddles was ahead of me on the trail, and as I hiked, I heard thunder in the distance. I had a signal on my phone and saw there were severe storm warnings with possible pea size hail. I sent a text to Puddles about the warning, and picked up my pace significantly, getting into Lost Pond shelter before the storm hit. When I got there, I expected Puddles to already be there, but she wasn’t. The next shelter was 1.7 miles from there, so I was hoping she wouldn’t get caught in between. Several people came into the shuttle, including Next Step, Sterling, Guppy, and others. Most of us made dinner while we waited out the storm, and a small bottle of Jim Beam got passed around to those who wanted some. The storm had almost broke and Next Step left. I gave him a message for Puddles that I wasn’t sure if I was leaving or not, it would depend on the weather. I ate dinner and the storm broke. More hikers were coming in, and not wanting to be crowded in the shelter, I took off. Puddles and I had already talked about a nice tenting site along Big Branch River. It was only 1.6 miles, so I headed out.
The sun came out, and with the beads of rain, and mist in the air, beams of light peeked through the trees. It was a stunning hike to Big Branch River. I crossed the bridge and turned right, where the tent sites were and saw Puddles tent, and Puddles sitting and talking to someone. I shouted “honey I’m home!”, and set up camp. Faith, who had just started a hike on the Long Trail, was in invited by Puddles to camp with us. We had great conversation. She had done her homework about backpacking and was very knowledgeable, she just needed to get over some of her nervousness about being out in the wilderness. It will come with being out for a few days. Pegasus showed up at camp and pitched his tent on a nice spot I had located earlier. We hung our food bags, and went to bed.","Bromley Mountain

We would also have an opportunity to do some slack packing from there. The days hike would go past Little Rock Pond, 
Aldrichville (an abandoned town settled in the 1880’s), Rock Garden,
White Rocks Cliff, Airport Lookout, and Clarendon Gorge. It was more views in one day than I think we’ve had to date. It was a nice day for hiking. Puddles and I hiked together past the Aldrichville site, where there were artifacts from the 1880’s abandoned village, and Rock Garden, before she hiked ahead. 
When I got to the White Rocks Cliff area, I wasn’t sure if she was stopping there for lunch. We had talked about it briefly. I tried to text her with no response. I headed toward cliff, which was a 2/10 mile side trail. It was steep descent, then an ascent up to the cliff area. No Puddles. I’m sure she looked at the steep descent and said “heck no” to it. It was a nice view. I took a few pictures and reluctantly headed back to the steep climb up. I caught up with Puddles sitting on a log, eating lunch. I sat down to eat, and she left a short time later. 
Guppy came up and sat down. She was hiking the Long Trail. Sierra hiked up and Guppy mentioned that Sierra was doing the AT. As Sierra arrived, she was commenting on how great it was to slack pack. I mentioned that Puddles and I would be slack packing the next day out of the yellow deli hostel, taking a bus to the trail, hiking, then taking a bus back to Rutland. She hadn’t heard of the Yellow Deli or the bus system, and was very excited. I explained it to her and she couldn’t wait to get to town. She was a teacher from San Diego, and only had a short time left to finish her goal for this year, of hiking to the Long Trail Inn, before flying back to California. 
I continued hiking and got a text from Puddles that she got off trail, and was now behind me. I waited for her and we hiked past Airport Overlook and Clarendon Gorge. We ran into a trail maintainer, his wife, his grandson and his grandson’s girlfriend. He and his wife had previously completed an AT thru hike.
We arrived at VT 103, stuck out our thumbs, and quickly got a ride to the Yellow Deli from Tom. We checked in with Aysh, who gave us a delicious ice cold peach Yerba mate tea and gave us lower bunks in an upstairs room.

During breakfast, Puddles and I made some last minute changes to the hiking itinerary for today and Friday.  Instead of hiking 17.8 in one day, including summiting Mt. Killington, leaving us with either 6.3 or 8.3 miles, to hike the second day, we decided to break it up more evenly and hike 11.5 up to the peak of Killington, then 11.5 to Thundering Brook road. We delayed our start, thinking the bus left every hour to go by the trailhead, but found out it only goes at 7am and 4:15pm.  We ended up calling a cab and were able to start hiking around 8:40am after being dropped off by Greg. 
We had been smelling a floral scent similar to a lilac or hyacinth the past few days and trying to figure out what it was. As we walked through a field before entering the forest area, Puddles found the plant with the amazing aroma. Neither of us know what it is, but we now know what it looks like.
Hiked past Clarendon Lookout, stopped at Governor Clement Shelter for lunch and continued on for the last 4.5 miles, the elevation went from 861 to 4235, with a 10% grade.  Upon reaching Cooper Lodge, a shelter near the Killington Peak, we began a 2/10 mile climb up Killington, a rock climbing scramble nearly straight up 350 feet. There was great views from the top, but we wanted to make sure we had time to catch the gondola, so we headed there. 
We wanted a snack, but the snack bar was closed. I went to the gondola operator and explained that we were AT thru hikers, getting off trail for the day, and coming back tomorrow. I asked about taking the gondola down. The young man went into the operation room, spoke to someone and came back out and told us to go ahead and ride it down. We were elated! It was a great ride down and we only had to wait a short time for the bus back into Rutland. We had a nice conversation with some passengers, sisters who were vacationing. 
We had dinner at the Yellow Deli when we returned. The Deli helps to support the hostel. The hostel is donation based. Hikers can stay for free, but there is a donation box and chores that hikers can do to contribute such as cleaning, helping to prepare the hiker breakfast in the morning, laundry ect.

We were again allowed to ride the gondola, and enjoyed the view going up. We stopped at the snack bar for snacks, and sat outside in Adirondack chairs, while taking in the amazing view of layers of mountains to the east. As we sat there, Puddles said “I walked here from West Virginia”. Sometimes, the day to day hiking makes you forget what you’ve accomplished. Before leaving, we ran into a hiker we had met who was hiking the long trail.
We then headed to the summit where the side trail went back down to AT. We took in the views to the west, then make our way down. I chatted with a woman sitting at the bottom of the side trail, while Puddles explored the Cooper Shelter located there. Another woman showed up and we all chatted a few minutes more before we headed out. It was a nice day of hiking with relatively smooth trail. During the hike, the Long Trail split off from the AT. We had met several Long Trail hikers who we would no longer see from this point on. 
We were walking through a campground the trail goes through, and the two women we saw earlier in the morning were pulling into the campground and stopped and asked where we were going, and if we needed a ride. One of them had thru-hiked the AT, and was in tune with hiker needs, such as rides. We gladly accepted a ride to the Long Trail Inn, where we wanted to catch up to Wind Eagle. We spent a few minutes talking to our trail angels Kaia and Kari, who were wonderful. They left and we joined Wind Eagle for beverages and dinner. It was great catching up with her before calling for a taxi to return us to the yellow deli. When we got back, the street was closed for a street fair. Live music and vendors were set up.

Puddles friend, Kim, picked Us up at the hostel. Before departing to go to Kim’s, we walked down the street to a farmers market.  We had some discussion about cooking dinner. The thought of meal planning and cooking was overwhelming to me. I only craved fresh fruit at that moment and couldn’t think beyond that. With the exception of when I was home for a few days the beginning of July. I haven’t cooked since April 27th. When I was home I made my standby veggie omelette every morning for breakfast. I went out to dinner most of the nights I was home, and Tressa cooked dinner on the only night we stayed home. 
We walked around the market for a while, and I saw grass fed beef. Burgers sounded like the least complicated thing to make. I checked with Puddles and we went with it. I’ve spent the last 74 days either rehydrating meals, eating at restaurants, or being provided meals at hostels. “Cooking” has not been part of my simplified life, and really doesn’t interest me at all. I look forward to it when I’m off the trail and back home, but not now.
After getting Panera coffee to go, we headed to Kim’s condo in Killington, where we were joined by Puddles husband, Brian. Later in the day, Wind Eagle and her sister, Ruth, who was going to hike a few days, came over to Kim’s. We all enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub. Brian had brought a resupply box that Tressa sent him. I took what I needed and put a few items in the box out of my pack, which he will hold onto while we are hiking in the area.

We passed by Kent Pond and heard a loon call. We stopped by Thundering Falls briefly. There were some nice boardwalks, then we began the ascent up Quinby Mountain. No one ever talks about Quinby. We were warned about it from Alligator who said she wasn’t expecting the climb. I also had notes from my ATI class about it. The next 1.6 miles were a continuous climb of 1330 feet at a 16% grade. At one point we came across an aluminum ladder strapped to a rock face that we climbed down. We had switchbacks which assisted us in the climb. We stopped for a snack about midway up the mountain. After the first 1.6 miles there was descents, level sections. and ascents. My right knee felt better for the first part of the day, but started hurting by the end of the day.

Puddles and I scoped out a route coming in from the opposite direction that we had hiked out the day before. From what I could see, I was quite certain Pete could get us back to the trail where we left off, with his Jeep. As we worked our way around the roads (there are no direct routes around this area) we made it to Chateauguay Rd. The road started out as a smooth dirt road, then got rougher. We came upon a “Class 4” Road Sign, that said “Use At Own Risk”.  As you can imagine, Pete was excited about “wheeling” down this road, and off we went! It was a wonderful bumpy ride right to the trail!  When we pulled up, our friends Krista, Ryan and dog Iggy were sitting at the side of the trail. I’m sure they were surprised to see us show up in a Jeep. We spent a few minutes at the trail head before Pete, Michelle, and Jana continued wheeling to a turn around location, and Puddles and I started hiking.

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599213,"I woke up the smell of bacon! We had wonderful breakfast of eggs and veggies and bacon, which Michelle cooked. It was a great change of pace from hydrated chia, flax, and oatmeal. There was a threat of thunderstorms. We hadn’t made it to “The Back Porch” yesterday, so that would be the first stop along the trail today. The Back Porch is off the trail, down a road a few hundred feet, sponsored by Firefly and Loon, previous AT Thru Hikers. It is the back porch of their home, with a refrigerator containing drinks, snacks, and ice cream treats. Hikers pay on the honor system for refreshments and treats. Firefly makes homemade ice cream cookie treats, which are the rave of hikers. It was only a 1/2 mile hike to get there. Firefly and Loon were at home and we were fortunate enough to be able to spend time with them, while we waited out a thunderstorm for 1 1/2 hours. 
The hiking was damp, with a light rain. It was warm on the hilltops, but there was an abundance of wild raspberries and I took advantage of the delicious snacks. One of the hilltops had a bench under a tree to sit and relax. Part of the terrain went through an area of tall evergreens with a pine needle covered trail. When I looked up, it reminded me of Dr. Suess. We crossed the White River coming into West Hartford, and ran across Chilli, who had found someone’s drivers license and credit card on the trail. We were trying to figure out if it was anyone we recognized. Of course the name wasn’t familiar, because most of us don’t know people’s real names. The vast majority of us only know each other by trail names. Chilli was going to hang on to the cards and try to get them back to the owner. Puddles and I continued on to Podunk Road, where Michelle picked us up. We headed back to the house to get reorganized with full packs to start the next day, while Michelle joined family members for the evening. The past several days have been great with the help of friends to slack pack and provide a place to stay. I am forever grateful for the amazing people in my life.

Puddles was excited that we would be reaching her home state of New Hampshire today. The weather was sunny and warm. The trail went into Norwich, VT, and when we came out of the woods, we found a set of Adirondack chairs at the end of a driveway with a cooler of cokes. Puddles and I sat down and enjoyed the cokes. The homeowners stopped by briefly and we thanked them. We headed into Norwich to Lilly and Omer’s, where we would be staying for the night. The Norwich VT/Hanover NH area have a tremendous hiker support system. There are several people who offer up places to stay and rides around town, and to trail heads. As we were walking, a silver lab named Ellafreese (Freesie) an across the street to greet us. Puddles and I stepped on the long leash to keep the dog from going back into traffic, while the owner, Jennie came to retrieve her. As it turns out, Jennie was the pastor of St. Barnabas Church, and a volunteer of the hiker support network. The church allows a limited number of hikers to stay, and  Jennie also puts up hikers at her home. We chatted for a while and headed to our home for the night, which was 2 doors down from Jennie’s.
Lilly met us and showed us to our accommodations, which is also used as an AirBNB rental. It was an upstairs, 2 bedroom apartment with a full kitchen, washer, dryer, full bath, AC, and desktop computer. The accommodations were outstanding. Lilly laid out ground rules for quiet hours and everything we needed to know. We packed some water and a couple of snacks and headed toward the New Hampshire State line, just down the street. We crossed the Connecticut River, the dividing line between Vermont and New Hampshire and entered the city of Hanover. We had lunch at Molly’s, and continued hiking through Hanover to Trescott Rd. We had a nice boardwalk for a time, as well as a steep climb, with a rope provided to assist. Puddles made arrangements for Bill Young, a friend of EddyMan and Aligator, to pick us up at Trescott Rd. He also had backpacks that Aligator and EddyMan left for us to try. He took us to the co-op where we had coffee, and he insisted on paying for food and snacks we had selected in the store. We sat down with him and gleaned a lot of information from him about hiking from Hanover to Katahdin. He also gave us a lot of information about the area. He dropped us off at Omer and Lilly’s with the packs we were borrowing from Aligator and Eddyman. We completed our off trail chores and ate dinner. While we were gone, Omer provided us with an assortment of beers, and we selected one to split. I worked on setting up the new pack so I can give mine to Brian to hold onto. Tomorrow will be a zero day so Puddles can see the podiatrist.","Tigertown / Podunk Roads

Hopefully it will help with the pain she’s been having, pretty much since she started hiking in West Virginia. She also got a shot in her foot at the podiatrist, which should help in calming the spasms and pain. We had dinner and Brian returned us to Jennie’s, where we will be staying tonight. We went out behind the church to pick raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries. I was talking on the phone to my friend Christine, and trying to do some planning for meeting up on the trail at some point. I was feeling extremely homesick, and a black cat that reminded me of my own, came up to me for attention. I was already crying, and this pushed me further into my emotions of sadness, but also joy for the timing of it. A reminder of the comfort of home. As I petted the cat and talked on the phone, Wind Eagle came out the door of the church. She said she was staying there tonight. I was still on the phone, and directed her to where Puddles was. A short time later, a second cat, reminding me of another at home, came up to me. It really was what I needed at the moment. 
Brian left after we dug through the resupply box, and we made ourselves at home in the hiker room upstairs.Thank you to trail angels Lilly and Omer!!!","

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599247,"I slept pretty well. In the late evening, one of the cats had brought a small mole into the house and put it down. The mole then ran under a heat radiator as the cat attempted to recapture it. This went on for a while. Both cats snuck into the room where Puddles and I were sleeping at different times and cuddled up with each of us, but one of them smelled a little “skunky”.  Even so, it was still nice to have some home-like comfort from them. When I got up in the morning, I found the mole, dead, under my bunk. I was so glad it wasn’t delivered directly to me. 
We said our goodbyes to Jennie, the animals, and a woman renting a room from Jennie as Bill Young picked us up to take us to the trail. He came up to the house and introduced himself to Jennie. Even though they were both trail angels on the Hanover/Norwich trail angel list, they had never met. 
Bill took us into Hanover where we took a photo of our feet on the AT plaque embedded in the sidewalk in   Hanover. It is a brass plaque, provided by the Dartmouth class of 1954. We also went to Lou’s Restaurant, where they give a free donut to thru hikers. In addition to my free donut, I had a maple bacon donut. It was covered with maple frosting and sprinkled with bits of bacon. I figured it would be the one and only time I would ever eat one. Once again, Bill paid for whatever we got at Lou’s, despite any resistance. He was very knowledgeable about the area and hiking, and shared interesting facts with us as we drove and walked around town. Bill dropped us off at Trescott Road and we hiked to Three Mile Road, where my friends Joe and Ali were picking us up for lunch. Joe and I have know each other since 2008, when we attended the FBI National Academy together. We had tried to coordinate something when we were in the New York area and it didn’t work out. They were currently on the way to a conference in Quebec and had time to stop for lunch. We went to Latham House Tavern in Lyme. They were very hiker friendly. When we went in, we were taken past a wall with an AT map that had recently been put up, and told to sign our names and where we were from on the wall. We had a good lunch and even better conversation, before going back to the trail. It was great spending time with Joe and Ali, even for the little amount of time we had. Thank you for lunch!
We hiked over Moose Mountain South, Moose Mountain North, and along Holt’s Ledge, stopping at Trapper John Shelter. It was a full house. There were some familiar faces, Stripper, Chilli, Iggy, Ryan, Krista, and Wind Eagle, just to name a few. Many of the tent sites were taken, but none of them were great. Almost all of them had a slant. We got in late and quickly set up camp and ate dinner. Many thanks to trail angels Jennie, Bill, Joe and Ali!!!","Trescott Rd, Hanover NH

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599314,"It was a nice day with good views from Lambert’s Ridge, Smarts Mountain Fire Tower, and Eastman Ledges. It was a nice but sometime tough day of hiking, but I thoroughly enjoyed NOT being in the rain. We stayed at Hexacuba Shelter with Stripper, Chilli, Pirate, Oatmeal, and Wind Eagle. The shelter is a unique six sided shelter, and quite roomy and comfortable to sleep in. There was no water source at the shelter, so we had to get water and carry it up the last 6/10 of a mile to the shelter. When I stopped to get water, I had taken my Z Seat and put it inside some webbing behind my back on the borrowed pack I was using. When I got to the shelter, I realized it was gone. Chilli was kind enough to run back toward the creek where I last had it to look for it. He caught up with some SOBOs (south bounders, going the opposite direction of us) and asked if they had found a z seat. They thought they had struck lucky trail magic, and disappointedly admitted they had it and gave it to Chilli. He showed back up at the shelter, Z seat in hand! My story is that Chilli beat them up to get my seat back, which is more fun to tell, and SO opposite of who Chilli is. He is one of the most amazing young men I’ve ever met. He is kind, introspective, and always smiling. You can’t help but feel good and have a great outlook on life when you’re around him. 
We ate dinner and turned in. We would get up at 4:30am to get to the road for a shuttle pick up to the Hikers Welcome Hostel before the rain hits in the morning.","Trapper John Shelter
",Hexacuba Shelter,"Jul 21, Sat",12
River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600558,"We got up to the 4:30 alarm. I packed up and had a snack bar. One by one we headed out to beat the rain. 
We went through Quartzite Ledges and over Mt. Cube. It was extremely windy on top and I had to lean into it so I wouldn’t get blown over. It reminded me of how I’ve had to lean forward for shotgun recoil during qualification shoots. 
There were good views, which I enjoyed for a few minutes before moving on. Two miles out, I contacted the hostel to pick us up at NH Rte 25C. When I got down to the road, Bisquick was there with a van and everyone was loading up. Stripper asked Bisquick if we could make a quick stop to find something to celebrate Wing Eagle’s upcoming birthday. She found a large Whoopi pie, big enough for several people to share, at a local country store. We arrived at the hostel and selected our bunks. The hostel was modest with the toilet, shower, sink, washer and dryer outside under a canopy. The common room inside served as kitchen, dining, computer room, and movie room. Showers and laundry were first priority, as always. We were driven to a local restaurant to pick up food to go for dinner. Puddles and I had the unfortunate situation of two thru hikers sleeping in the bunks above us, and neither taking a shower. There is no stank like thru hiker stank when showers are not taken, and clothes not washed. Normally when arriving at a hostel, everyone is fighting to get in the shower. It amazes me when people don’t take advantage of the opportunity to be clean. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t smell like a peach. I am embarrassed about the odor that emanates from me after 3 days of not showering. I cannot wait to take a shower, even if it’s only 1 day. I don’t like  walking around with a “pig pen” cloud surrounding me.
The hiker above me layed on his bunk for a while, and when he got up, the odor lingered from his sheets. Ugh! 
Tomorrow we’ll take advantage of a slack pack.","Hexacuba Shelter
",NH 25A,"Jul 22, Sun",4.90
River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600622,"A short time before my alarm went off, the hiker sleeping above me climbed into his bunk. I woke up to an alarm, and stanky hiker #1 standing in front of my bunk talking to stanky hiker #2, telling him he was going to take a shower before starting his hike. Now the shower situation makes even less sense to me. I didn’t sleep much last night due to a guy who was staying at the hostel who was talking loudly downstairs after quiet hours. He was a previous thru hiker who appeared to just be hanging out, and providing a few rides. He slept upstairs in the bunk room on the sofa, but even kept me awake with his snoring and coughing. I can usually sleep through anything.
I got up and ate breakfast and caught the shuttle out to complete a 9.7 mile slack pack from 25A to 25, basically hiking back to the hostel. It was a uneventful day of hiking in the rain. It’s never fun hiking in the rain, and today was no different. I do enjoy my umbrella though. It keeps the rain from pounding on me, and allows me to take some photos. I was treated with trail magic in the form of an ice cream sandwich at the end of the day from a trail angel in the parking lot.
During the night last night, Rainbow, who had been camping behind the hostel, got out of her tent briefly. She had left a snack in the tent, and left the door open. When she returned, there was a skunk who had gone inside to eat the snack. Needless to say, shooing a skunk out of tent isn’t a viable option, so she ended up going inside the hostel to crash. She told me the young stanky hikers were trying to stay awake all night last night, and in their research they learned it’s easier to stay awake if you don’t take a shower. Lucky us that they decided to do that on the night they slept in bunks above us!","NH 25A

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600639,"Ryan, Krista and Iggy were leaving the hostel today, so we said our goodbyes, not knowing if we would see them again. 
We were hoping for dry weather today, but it wasn’t in the cards. It would rain most of the day. We would be going over Mt. Moosilauke, with an elevation of 4802 feet. The climb is approximately 4 miles, with an average grade of approximately 16%. Of course, when hiking up, one also has to hike down. We hiked the 9.5 miles southbound, as it was the safer direction, and ended up at the road where the hostel was located. 
Moosilauke starts the beginning of the hardest part of the trail, which ends approximately 225 miles north, after the Bigelows in Maine. That is not to say that the rest of the trail is easy. Far from it. The consensus is that it is the most difficult. Hiking paces slow down due to significant elevation changes. 
The hike started along Beaver Brook and up to Beaver Brook Falls. As it rained, the trail turned into steep rock slabs and water puddles. The goal was to stay safe, and get it done. Some parts were so steep, there were wooden steps attached to the rock faces to walk up. As I approached the top of the tree line, the wind picked up. Above tree line, it was like a monsoon.  The wind was blowing the rain sideways, and I had to lean into it as it pushed me sideways as I walked. My umbrella was nearly useless, although I did turn it toward the wind to help shield me. The rain stung as it hit my legs. Visibility was poor as I stopped briefly to take fuzzy photos at the peak, then moved quickly to get below tree line to finish the hike down. The sun came out before the end of day, and some of the trail went through a field. 
There was trail magic again today at the parking lot at NH 25. I joined Puddles and a couple other hikers, choosing a Long Trail Ale as my treat. After enjoying our trail magic, we headed back to the hostel for a shower and dinner. Tomorrow we will head toward the Kinsmans.","NH 25
",Kinsman Notch,"Jul 24, Tue",9.50
River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600641,"I had oatmeal, a croissant breakfast sandwich, chocolate milk, and Mountain Dew for breakfast. I said goodbye to Wind Eagle before jumping in the van to get shuttled to Kinsman Notch to start hiking. I’m sure we’ll see her along the trail again. 
We hiked over Mt. Wolf, a 3500 foot, tree covered peak. After crossing over the peak, we ran into Mudsmeller and Cutie Handful sitting on a log at the side of the trail. They were changing their hiking plans a bit, because they were moving slower than expected. They had some reservations at huts, and wanted to keep them , so they decided they would do some day hiking, instead of trying to cover ground backpacking. 
The trail was covered with large puddles of water and mud because of the large amount of rainfall in the past few days. There were some bog crossings where the logs put in place to walk on, had sunk and were impossible to walk on. Puddles and I had to bushwhack around one of the bogs, as the water was at least 1 1/2 feet deep when I checked it with my trekking pole, and we did not want to find out if it was any deeper.  Most of the day was spent navigating water, mud, wet tree roots, and wet slabs of rock. Some of the trail was forgiving, with pine needle covering it, along with the familiar balsam scent that I’ve become accustomed to and enjoy immensely. 
Throughout the day, the hiking required pulling myself up and down with exposed tree roots as well as rock climbing. After having fallen twice yesterday and once the day before, I was happy that I didn’t fall today. Hiking this section of the trail requires focus, and today I found myself getting mentally drained. Just when I think I have good solid footing, my foot slides down a rock or along a tree root. Most of the time I catch myself before losing my balance or falling. When I do go down, it happens so quickly, I barely know what hit me. 
Today was a day of no views. The only view I had all day was when the forest opened up to an area cleared for power lines. I was able to see some mountains in the distance, and a mountainside near the clearing. I did come across a bird nest in the ground at the side of the trail with newly hatched babies. I discovered it the same way I did the last one, when an adult bird flew in front of me, coming from the ground.
We arrived at Eliza Brook Shelter and set up inside the shelter. Rainbow was there with her tent set up. She shared some delicious tea with Puddles and I, which hit the spot after hiking in mucky conditions all day. Several hikers came into camp, many setting up tents. Several wet hikers set up in the shelter. 
I scoped out Eliza Brook, which we would be crossing in the morning. It appears there is a route across some boulders that we should be able to navigate. Puddles and I plan to get up at 4:30 and hike out if it isn’t raining.","Kinsman Notch
",Eliza Brook Shelter,"Jul 25, Wed",7.50
River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601063,"I slept fairly well in the shelter. I woke up a couple of times, probably in anticipation of the 4:30 alarm. Every time I woke up, all I could hear was pouring rain. Eliza Brook was about 75 yards from the shelter, and the roaring white water kept getting louder through the night. I knew that the boulders in the brook I had scouted out for crossing would not be an option by morning because the water was rising with the rain. The alarm went off at 4:30. It was still raining. Puddles and I had a brief discussion, I shut off the alarm and we went back to sleep. The other hikers started packing up and eating a couple of hours later. The rain finally stopped and they were ready to move on. There was a lot of scouting by several hikers to find the best place to cross the now raging brook. These hikers were much younger and athletic than I, so it made me nervous that they were nervous about the crossing. 
One hiker who had hiked in to camp this morning wearing a santa hat, had realized that the brook needed to be crossed 1 mile up, after crossing it near the shelter. His plan was to “bushwhack” up to the trail 1 mile away without crossing the brook twice. Most people were on board with that plan. Puddles and I discussed several options including hiking back southbound and coming off trail, then come back and do the section. We also considered bushwhacking. Rainbow had also been part of the discussion. A short time later, the younger thru hikers had built a makeshift log bridge, crossing to a large boulder in the brook. Rainbow watched the construction, and six people cross over it. She came back and said she thought we should take a look at it, and give it consideration. Puddles and I agreed, and quickly ate our breakfast and packed up. I was very nervous about the crossing and feeling a lot of anxiety over it. I took my time packing, trying to get myself to calm down. I figured if six people had crossed already, there was no reason why we couldn’t. I strapped my pack on and headed to the brook, doing breathing exercises along the way. I stopped to take a couple of quick photos and bushwhacked to the location where the logs were, and where Rainbow and Puddles were waiting.
Rainbow went first, crawling carefully along the small logs, with the whitewater rushing below. As she reached the boulder, she accidentally knocked one of the outside logs off from the shore side. The end of the log went down into the water, with the end that was resting on the boulder popping up and momentarily getting stuck under her. After she cleared the water and was completely on the boulder, the log was pulled completely into the water and swept away. Puddles and I agreed that the log was unnecessary for the crossing. We waited for Rainbow to reach the shore from the boulder on the other side, then Puddles crossed, and I crossed. It was a slow and careful crawl, as I kept my feet hooked on the outside of the logs to ensure they stayed in place. My hands were shaking when I reached the boulder and I slowly and carefully stood up. I took a few minutes to stop shaking, then took my boots off and put on my water/camp shoes to complete the crossing through the water to shore. It was a crazy way to cross, but worked. 
The rest of the day consisted of an additional fording of water and walking down wet and muddy trail. A hiker going the opposite direction told me about some bog bridges that were underwater a short distance after the ford, so I left my water crossing/camp shoes on and hiked in them until I was past the under water boards. At one point, I had stepped in the water and sunk up to my knee, so I was careful to walk through the water on the boards as much as I could. 
It was a very wet day with the hike going over South Kinsman Mountain (4358’) and North Kinsman Mountain (4293’), among with several waterfalls. Parts of the hike were over steep, wet rocks and rock faces, and very difficult. We arrived at Lonesome Lake Hut where we were able to get “work for stay”.  Work for stay is available to a limited number of thru hikers at the huts through the White Mountains. It includes dinner, breakfast, and a place to sleep on the dining room floor. In exchange, a hiker does whatever work is requested by the hut master. Work for stay hikers don’t eat until everyone is done eating. The meals consist of whatever is left over. Usually, most of good food, like bacon, is gone. Sometimes chores are in the evening, but most of the time they are in the morning, which delays hiking start times. 
After dinner the work for stay hikers have to wait until quiet hours, which start at 9:30. Most hikers are usually in bed no later than 8:30, so staying awake until 9:30 is a challenge. Once the “paying” customers clear out of the dining room at 9:30, hikers quickly move tables, sweep, and set up sleeping pads. In the morning, all the hikers need to pack up by 6:15 a.m. and be out of the dining room. After everyone is done eating, hikers eat the leftovers and complete their work. 
The paying customers are not told about the work for stay hikers. When the early risers come to the dining room for coffee and see hikers packing up and getting dressed, they sometimes have a confused look on their face. 
Besides Puddles and I, Rainbow and one other hiker were work for stay hikers. Lights were out at 9:30. We settled in for a good nights sleep.","Eliza Brook Shelter

I woke up and packed. I slept well during the night. While waiting for leftovers for breakfast, I went down to the lake to see the sunrise. After eating, we were given the job of thoroughly cleaning the bunk rooms. This included wiping down window sills, wiping down bunks, folding blankets, and sweeping floors. The four of us went to work and finished as quickly as we could,  while providing quality work. Puddles and I were motivated by meeting Brian and niece Lauren for lunch. Lauren was going to hike with us after lunch. We got a later start than we wanted because of the work for stay, but only had 2.9 miles to hike. Brian and Lauren picked up Puddles, Rainbow and I, and we went to lunch. Afterward, we came out to pouring rain. Buckets of rain. I had reached my breaking point after days of rain, wet and steep rocks, walking through water, hiking up streams of water on the trail, and being wet. I broke out in tears and said I couldn’t take the rain anymore. We were planning to hike an additional 3 miles, but with the amount of rain we were getting, we would be walking up a stream. We decided to take a nero day and stay the night in town. We ran errands for supplies and food. I replaced another lost bandana. Rainbow, knowing that I lose bandannas (and qother items) on a regular basis, picked up a nice bright green one from the hiker box at the post office for me.  Hiker boxes are all along the trail at locations frequented by hikers such as hostels, motels, hotels, post offices, restaurants, and stores. Hikers can donate things they don’t need such as food and gear. Hikers can also take what they need. 
We tried to find a place where Puddles, Rainbow, and I could stay in the same room, but just about everything in town was booked. Puddles and I ended up getting rooms at the Liberty Motel and Rainbow made arrangements to stay at a hostel. We dropped off Rainbow and after getting taken out food for dinner, headed to the motel. Wing Eagle was there with LeAnn. Wing Eagle is experiencing some severe knee pain and will be going home to see a doctor.

I woke up without an alarm while the student leader group camped in front of my tent platform continued to sleep. I ate breakfast, packed up, and left my campsite at 7:00am. I saw Twister and Chad The Dad my way out and asked what time Puddles left. They advised she was about 10 minutes ahead of me. Today was a big day. In 4.9 miles we would get to Little Bigelow Lean To which marks the end of the most difficult 227 miles of the trail. We would also pass the 1,000 mile mark today. 
The sun was a hazy pastel orange-yellow color as I walked the side trail back to the main trail. There was a large boulder over the side trail, forming a small cave of sorts. It reminded me of Hocking Hills in Ohio, on a smaller scale.
There were some steep climbs and descents, as I summited Little Bigelow Mountain. I caught up with Puddles and captured her on video as she navigated a steep boulder and gave thanks to her boots for hanging on, after hanging in the balance of being able to continue up the rock, or slipping down. She also decided that was a location that needed a rope to assist with climb. 
I stopped briefly for a couple of views. Puddles and I looked back on the peaks we crossed yesterday in amazement. It’s always good to looks back and see the accomplishment, something I’ve tried to do throughout this journey. 
I stopped to take some photos along the way and Puddles got ahead of me. I also took time to partake in the delicious wild blueberries that have covered the mountain tops for the past couple of weeks. Today’s blueberries were sweeter than yesterday’s, and much more plentiful. It’s a trail magic treat, given by the trail, and a great change of pace to the packaged snacks I carry.
I arrived at Little Bigelow Lean To well ahead of my estimated arrival time. Puddles was there and agreed we were making good time. I pulled out some celebratory toffee I had been saving to mark the end of the 227 hardest miles and shared it with Puddles. The toffee was a surprise in my last resupply box from Tressa. She always puts a special treat in every box!
When I went back down the side trail from the lean to, I turned right instead of left and added a couple of tenths to my day. At some point during the morning, Puddles mentioned possibly going further than we had planned and camping at East Carry Pond. It would also put us in position to be able to get to the Kennebec River Ferry during the hours of operation, which is 9am-2pm. We were both game and it became our new goal for the day. 
At Flagstaff road, I was making a beeline down the road to the trailhead. As I passed the parking lot, I noticed a canopy and saw several hikers including Puddles and Twister. Trail Magic! I immediately spun to my left with military precision that any drill sergeant would approve of, and headed straight to the canopy. One of the NOBOS parents is providing support to her, also provided trail magic. I selected a cold sprite and a bag of french onion chips. 
Further up the trail, there was additional trail magic along the shore of Flagstaff Lake, root beer and orange soda. I took an orange soda and downed it in about 90 seconds and continued on.
I caught up with Puddles and determined the 1,000 mile mark. We designed our 1,000 mile marker out of sticks and leaves. We also added a curved stick with arrows on each end and two letter F’s to indicate our “flip flop” hike. We took photos and Puddles recorded a video of her singing to Brian and toasting with a root beer she had carried from Flagstaff Lake. 
We headed to West Carry Pond Lean To to take one last break before getting to camp.
Although we were done with the hardest part of the trail, it wasn’t a cake walk. Puddles had read a comment posted by a hiker in Guthook that the trail was “heaven” between Flagstaff Rd and the Kennebec River. It was anything but. Although we were out of very steep and sometimes dangerous climbs and descents, we were now contending with rocks, roots, and mud. Sometimes it’s hard not to get mad at the trail. It’s not the trail’s fault. I am its’ guest for a short amount of time, and I accepted the challenges once I took my first step. Despite the challenges, “the trail provides” as the saying goes out here, and it does. 
As I hiked closer to East Carry Pond, I could hear loons in the distance. I arrived at East Carry Pond Beach and hiked a little further and found Twister and Chad the Dad at a stealth site. Puddles showed up a couple minutes later and we decided to camp with Twister and Chad the Dad. Before I got camp established, I went for a swim at the beach before I cooled down. It felt great to dive in the cool water and wash down. The water was clear and I could see leeches, so I kept moving the entire time so they wouldn’t attach to me. 
I set up camp, and ate dinner. Along with occasional loon calls, we were treated to a beautiful orange moon over the pond before going to bed.","Safford Notch

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601659,"Woke up several times during the night and got up shortly after 5:30. Had a hot breakfast and packed up. Puddles left 15 minutes before me. Today started with a 2.1 mile climb which began immediately. The terrain varied from rocks, dirt, mud, and roots to pine needle carpeted and rock slab paths. There were several locations which required grabbing onto a small tree, rock, or root to assist with climbing up or down.  The day started off cloudy, but the clouds blew off. Prior to summiting Moxie Bald Mountain, there was a unique rock slab overhang with a cave area. I remember it from a section hike in 2012. The top of Moxie Bald had great views today. I walked to the summit which was a short distance from the trail. 
Coming down from the peak gave great views of Bald Mountain Pond. It was a slow, somewhat steep descent but nothing like what I experienced through the White Mountains. The descents here are quick downs, sometimes requiring the use of trees, roots, and rocks to get down, but not like the long, steep, slippery rock slabs I experienced in the Whites. 
On the way down I ran into Dr. Who, Red Hawk, and Cribbage. 
Two miles after Moxie Bald, I arrived at Moxie Bald Lean To. This evoked memories of my 2012 section hike with Jewel, Hummingbird, and Rising Dawn. We hiked from Monson to Caratunk. There was lots of rain and flash flood warnings. When we started out, the weather was nice. We got to Moxie Bald Lean To and set up our tents. It started raining buckets overnight. Everyone who was in the lean to left. The four of us moved into the lean to, and there we stayed. We ended up zeroing, trying to get our gear dry. We challenged ourselves to start a fire, and managed to do so with a lot of birch bark. It started to pour again after that, and back into the lean to we went. It was Hummingbirds birthday so we celebrated with dehydrated cupcakes that I brought, and “cheesecake” which was mislabeled, ending up being instant mashed potatoes! We still get a great laugh out of it. 
I arrived at Bald Mountain Stream where I found Cribbage laying in the sun, and Red Hawk in his underwear. He apologized for his lack of clothing, explaining that he had fallen in the water and was trying to dry his clothes. Puddles was on the other side of the stream, putting her boots on after fording the crossing. She warned me about slippery rocks in the stream. I figured I could cross it in my boots and stay dry, but opted for my sandals to ensure my boots stayed dry. I had no problem crossing, keeping my sandals dry. Red Hawk brought his and Cribbage’s packs across, then sat in the sun. I left and they passed me down the trail. I arrived at the crossing for the West Branch of the Piscataquis River where Puddles was sitting in the shade. Neither of us had eaten lunch so we ate before fording the river. This was the location I had lost my crocs in 2012 when fording. The water was very high with a fast current at the time. The current took my feet out from under me, my crocs came off and floated down the river. It shook me up a bit. The others took my pack across and I crossed in my bare feet.
Today would be different. I strapped on my sandals, found the shallowest location, and easily made my way across. There was a rope to assist with crossing, but it was very high, and not necessary because of the shallow water. I’m sure it’s much more helpful when the water is high.
I put my boots on while Puddles crossed, and moved on. One other hiker came across. 
It was a nice hike along the river. We arrived at Horseshoe Canyon Lean To and decided to move on to find a campsite closer to the river or water source, as the water source was 2/10 of a mile from the lean to. A note in the Guthook app indicated a site 7/10 of a mile. We found it, next to the river, and set up. It was a beautiful site and we would have the sound of the river to enjoy all night. It was a great day which ended with dinner, and Puddles and I sharing “trail brownies”.","Bald Mountain Brook

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602507,"Mt. Katahdin was named by the Penobscot American Indian Tribe and means “The Greatest Mountain”.  It is a sacred place, with most members of the tribe choosing not to summit it. At 5270’, it is the highest point in Maine, and one of the most difficult hikes in the east. It serves as the northern terminus of Appalachian Trail.  Henry David Thoreau described the north woods of Maine as ""stern and savage"" and his attempt to summit Mt. Katahdin in 1846 with two companions failed, but inspired him in his writings.
The morning began by packing up and eating breakfast, which was interrupted by a downpour. It was 30% chance of rain, so we all hoped the downpour completed the 30% chance for the day. Brian drive us to Katahdin Stream Campground, where we made final preparations for the summit. Galaxy completed some yoga, while facing the mountain, properly respecting, and revering the meaning of the mountain to the tribe who named her. Swarms of gnats and small black bugs surrounded us as we prepared. 
We all moved down the trail, with a quick stop for a group photo. I went ahead with Galaxy and Songbird, while Puddles and Brian hiked together. The first mile of the trail was a comfortable hike, then became steeper, with a challenging 1 mile, 1,000 foot ascent during the middle of 5.2 mile summit, a technical climb which was aided by the use of rebar handholds and footholds. A mile from the summit, the trail leveled off to a rocky path called the “Tablelands”. Clouds rolled in and enveloped us in the foggy mist. As we got closer to the summit, the sun began to peek through, with glimpses of blue sky through windows formed by the clouds. 
As I climbed the mountain, I almost felt like a traitor to the Penobscot Tribe. It wasn’t about “conquering” the mountain, it was about respecting it and the meaning behind it. It was a mixture of feelings of accomplishment, knowing this marked the end of the northern section of my journey, the most difficult part of the trail, the transition to final part of the journey in the south, and reverence for the mountain. Despite all these thoughts, I felt “matter of fact” about it all. About 40 yards from the summit, I started thinking about all the times I wanted to quit, all the times I cried, the pain in my feet that woke me up at night, the people who have supported my journey, becoming comfortable with being uncomfortable. Emotions overtook me and I stopped, put my forehead on the top of my trekking poles and began to sob. I slowly made my way toward Galaxy and Songbird, who were sitting just before the Katahdin summit sign, tears continuing to fall unexpectedly. I hugged them and the three of us took in the overwhelming moment. 
Pictures followed. Then we took up a position which sheltered us from the wind that had picked up and ate lunch. A few more minutes at the summit, and we headed down. The wind was picking up and the temperature was dropping as we departed. We crossed paths with Puddles and Brian as we made our way to the Abol Slide Trail, where we would complete our descent. 
One mile from the peak, at Thoreau Spring, is the Abol Trail, one of many side trails that ascend the mountain. We took the Hunt Trail up, which is the Appalachian Trail. The top of the Abol Trail starts off very steep, a nearly straight up and down large boulder scramble. As we descended, the trail turns into steep switchbacks, then loose pebbles, dirt path, rocky path, gradually becoming less steep, to a more comfortable walking path. 
It became clear that we would not make it back to catch the shuttle to Millinocket. Kathryn was going to give us a ride to Lewiston from Millinocket. We stopped at Abol Campground to eat a snack and take a relaxing break. We then moved to the road, hoping to get a hitch for the 2 miles back to the campground. One person stopped with room for one, so I jumped in with Judy. She was camping in Baxter Park, and dropped me off at the entrance to Katahdin Stream Campground. Galaxy and Songbird arrived a short time later after getting a hitch. We gathered our packs, hoping to hitch a ride to Millinocket. With no luck in the park, and swarms of gnats around us, we decided to walk to the road at the entrance of the campground. Some campers were packing their car, but had so much gear, there wasn’t room for anyone. The gnats didn’t follow us, so we at least had relief from them. 
I was able to contact Kathryn at some point to let her know we missed the shuttle and didn’t know when we would be in Millinocket. I also let her know that my friend from Lewiston planned to pick us up in Bangor, but could get us in Millinocket, if needed.
We made a couple attempts at a ride with no success. We watched for Puddles and Brian in a car coming to the park, figuring they would be able to catch a ride from someone. After a while, they pulled out of the park. They had caught a ride from a ranger and went into the campground on a backroad and we missed them going in. They looked puzzled when they saw us and not sure if we could “all” fit in. A hiker popped out of the car. We got all our packs in, and squeezed into the back seat. We stopped at the entry gate where Brian visited with a woman he had served in the navy with, but hadn’t seen for several years. We had dinner in Millinocket, then went to the hotel where Puddles and Brian were staying. Sara showed up about 10 minutes later, and Galaxy, Songbird, and I piled into her car and drove to Lewiston.  What a great day it was! The north section of the trail is done, and the south awaits...","Katahdin Stream Campground

It was a foggy morning and we all walked through the southern end of town before saying our goodbyes. Puddles, Eddyman, and I headed out and crossing the Shenandoah River. I felt a little stiff and it took a couple of hours before I felt warmed up. The trail started off ok with a mixture of dirt and rock, then was some decent, comfortable trail for a while. There were rocks, but enough dirt to step on to avoid the rocks. At some point I moved ahead for a while. I saw eight deer throughout the day, most of which had very little interest that I was there. One baby deer was feeding just off the trail and I spent quite a bit of time taking photos and videos of him, and talking to him. We all stopped for a lunch break after crossing into Virginia from West Virginia. I heated up some water for coffee and we relaxed for a bit. Eddyman and Puddles took off before I did. They were headed to the Blackburn Trail Center. I wasn't sure if I would stop there, or move along further, waiting to see how I felt as the day went on. Before I arrived at the Blackburn Center, I got a call from Blueberry, a hiker I met at Poplar Ridge Lean-to in Maine, then crossed paths with a couple of times after. She knew I had a date in mind that I wanted to finish by, and so did she. The projected path of Hurricane Florence was currently taking a northernly route. Shenandoah National Park was closing the next day, which would limit the amount of mileage once the park was reached. Blueberry was going to head home to Tennessee, then start hiking south in North Carolina in order to keep hiking, and not be stuck in Front Royal. Her dad was picking her up and she offered the option to me to go with her. It seemed reasonable. I had about two more days I could hike, then would have to stop. I told her I would think about it and call her back. I caught up with Eddyman and Puddles who were waiting at the side trail to Blackburn. Puddles said she could barely see me coming through because of the fog. I told them about Blueberry's plan and that I was considering it. The offer was open to anyone who wanted to go. Puddles and Eddyman decided they would stay. Being up for an adventure (as if what I currently doing wasn't enough) I decided I would go. We said our goodbyes and I headed off, hiking another 7 miles to get to a location for a shuttle to pick me up and take me to Front Royal. The rocks on the trail increased to the point that the trail was completely covered with them, and there was no way to avoid them. I also began hiking the ""roller coaster"" which is exactly what it sounds like, hills going up and down. The rocks reminded me of the rocks in Pennsylvania, which mutilated my feet at the beginning of my hike in May. The last four miles to Rte 7 for a shuttle pick up was rough, and it was nearly dark by the time I got there. A copperhead snake in the trail reminded me that I was back in poisonous snake country again and would need to be alert. Mike picked me up and took me to Front Royal to jump in with Blueberry and her dad, David. Mike is a former through hiker who now runs a shuttle service and hostel. I'll admit, I was a little grumpy after walking on the rocks. Everyone was talking about how great the trail was in the south and I wasn't expecting the rocks. Mike was a good conversationalist and helped me lighten up a bit. We got into Blueberry's parents home late, and I settled in to the pool house in a very comfortable bed.","Harpers Ferry ATC Side Trail

I watched news about Hurricane Florence, which had not made landfall. Today we would get laundry done and repack our gear. I spent some time with the cats, one of which doesn't come up to strangers, except me. Every time I open the door to go outside of the pool house, the cat would run across the pool deck and wanted attention. It felt like home. 
By the afternoon, we were ready and headed out. We stopped at grandpa's house, where Blueberry and I were given a bag of dried fruit medley to take with us. We left and headed toward the trail. We would be starting at Fontana Dam and hike south three days to Franklin, NC. At Franklin, we would assess the weather and if it was good, would continue three more days to Hiawassee, GA. On the way, I took a look at the trail alerts. An alert had been issued while we were visiting with grandpa which indicated the trail where we planned to hike was being closed the next day at noon. We stopped the car, checking all the information. We were done. Florence had taken a more southernly route and was projected to follow a different path. Based the information we had when we decided to to go south, it all made sense, but Florence had a different idea. 
We stopped and picked up some food and beverages on the way home and talked about how we would likely be changing our plans down the road for the rest of the hike to accommodate the delay. After dinner we went for a nice boat ride and enjoyed a great sunset. Blueberry and her parents could not have been nicer.

As I was waking in the morning, but not fully conscious, I started my morning stretching ritual which begins with stretching my legs lengthwise, as if I’m trying to make them longer (as if...). I then attempt to contract my quads. This is something I have been doing for a few weeks, but barely get a response, and it causes pain in my kneecap. My knees and patellar tendons are inflamed and tight. I have lost a lot of mobility since starting my hike, especially during the time I hiked through the White Mountains where they were pounded by going downhill on rock. My knees have hyperextended more times than I can count, and every time they do, it causes a shooting pain that stops me dead in my tracks until I recover. I stretch every morning, but with my quads not contracting properly, I am unstable when I hike, especially when going downhill and down stairs.  I have learned to widen my stance as I hike to make up for the instability. Going down is the hardest part of hiking for me as it is painful, and my right knee occasionally gives out. 
As I laid in my half asleep state, thinking that I was home, and just had an MAT treatment, I couldn’t figure why my legs didn’t work. As I woke up, I realized I had been dreaming. This prompted me to take another look at the possibility of going home. Airfare was expensive but a rental car $99 plus tax, and a 7 1/2 hour drive. I got a ride from Blueberry’s mom (“The Warden”) to pick up a rental car, and I was on my way. I made a quick stop in Cincinnati for a break, and to say hi to my friend Jo, who came out to be a trail angel in Pennsylvania on Memorial Day.

It will certainly help in keeping me healthy to finish the trail.
Mike, a shuttle driver, picked me up from the airport, stopped so I could get fuel, and took me directly to the trial. It wasn't raining, but it was damp and the trail was wet. When I left off, I had completed 4 of 14 miles of the ""Roller Coaster"", a 14 mile stretch of steep climbs and descents with few views. In addition to the climbs and descents, there are several rocky sections. It was a good re-introduction back to the trail. The day was relatively uneventful and I ended up at Rod Hollow Shelter with Gizmo, Dreamer, Spirit, and Jim, who arrived after I did.  I arrived a little late and did not feel like setting up my tent, so I slept in the shelter.

There was more mud than yesterday. There really hasn't been much give in the weather to have the trail dry out. The rain stopped after a short time, and I ran into a lot of day hikers, some in large groups, including boys scouts. I talked to a few day hikers who were curious about my hike. Many people don't know much about the Appalachian trail, even though they're hiking on it. I can't say that I knew a lot about it the first time I hike on it either.I hiked 15 miles to a point that I could get picked up by Mike, who also has a hostel. I will be staying at his hostel and doing some day hiking, also referred to as ""slack packing"". I want to keep my feet dry, so staying at a hostel affords the opportunity to dry out wet shoes and clothing. It also gives the opportunity to do some day hiking, which helps keep the body healthy by not carrying a full pack, along with the ability to hike more miles. Hostels are also more reasonably priced than hotels, and provide picks ups from the trail. I will likely be taking advantage of hostels and day hiking opportunities during the southern half of my hike.

There really wasn't anywhere to go around him, or to bushwhack around him, so I told him to please get off the trail. He slowly moved off trail about 8 feet. He then raised his head up in a somewhat coiled position, like a copperhead. I had been told by another hiker a while back that Black snakes will mimic the behavior of other snakes, which is exactly what he was doing. Black snakes are not poisonous, but with him mimicking a Copperhead snake, he was very intimidating. I slowly worked my way by him, then quickly moved on. I normally like to get some photos if I can, but I didn't waste any time getting away from him. I saw a few deer during the day.

Whenever another cat comes near her, she passes one going in or out, or when she gets petted, she hisses. She climbed up on my lap and let me pet her, without hissing at me, and took a nap. Alison couldn't believe it and called me ""River the Cat Whisperer"".  It was a good day.","Keyser Run Rd, Skyline Dr, Shenandoah National Park

While I was home, Puddles notified me that she was going home to recover from her Fibromyalgia flare up. I’m disappointed that she has to come off trail after coming so far, but she can’t hike until she gets healthy. Being home gives her the best chance of recovery to get back on trail. I’m confident she can get back and still finish this year. She’s one of the toughest people I know out here, with everything she’s dealt with since we started. I’m not sure I would have stayed the course with some of the painful conditions she has had. All my best to her for a healthy return. Eddyman also decided to come off trail. I enjoyed spending time hiking with him earlier in the summer, and for a few days more recently. I will miss them both while they are off trail.
My friend Christine and I had breakfast at a local restaurant and headed out. I’ve known Christine since 1990. She has moved to Franklin NC since retiring, and has been very supportive of me the entire summer. I’ve been looking forward to getting to the south so I can spend some time with her. She has offered to shuttle me around and help me get through the south. 
It was foggy at Clingmans Dome with no view. Christine walked the half mile up up to the dome and bid me farewell. I started hiking, and she then appeared from the other end of the loop of the trail, where she walked and met me on trail, before heading back to the parking lot. It was misty, which I don’t mind hiking in. It sprinkled a little, but not enough to concern me. There was a 40% chance of rain with 1/10 of an inch accumulation forecasted. I had a 16.3 mile day planned. Based on my usual average speed, I figured it would take about 8 hours.The trail started off pleasant, and gradually became more difficult. After a couple hours, it began to rain lightly, then more heavy and steady. I attached my umbrella to my shoulder strap. Because it was 40% chance of rain, I anticipated it would stop at some point. With 6 miles to go, I stopped at Derrick Knob Shelter and had a quick snack. The terrain was getting increasingly difficult with rocks, roots, mud, and water. It was still raining and I briefly contemplated staying at Derrick Knob Shelter. If I did, it would give me a 22 mile day the next day, which I wasn’t up for, and probably wasn’t capable of, given the terrain I was encountering. I was still at a point where I could get to my destination of Spence Field Shelter with daylight remaining.
One of the gear ties securing my umbrella broke, so I had to repeatedly adjust it with the small piece that was barely functional. To complicate matters, I felt off balance, like my equilibrium was off. Sometimes I would step, feeling like I would fall backwards or sideways.
I continued on, and so did the rain. 
There were steep ascents and descents with little to no switchbacks. About an hour before sunset, I saw Thunder Mountain towering ahead of me. I knew it was going to be a big climb. The mud and water on the trail continued getting worse. I completed the climb, while it became increasingly rocky and dark. I put my headlamp on. Hiking with the headlamp made my balance feel even more off. I summited Rocky Top in the dark. I was hoping for a better view than darkness when I summited, but at this point, I was just ready to get air lifted off the peak and go home. The hiking was slow and miserable in the rain. Every step was unsteady.
It was still raining and I headed down the rocky, unstable descent to get to the shelter. I kept trying to call home to say that I was quitting the trail, and would be home as soon as I could get off, but my calls didn’t go through. I ate a protein bar while hiking so I could just hang my food bag and go to bed when I got to the shelter. I finally arrived at 8:40 and everyone in the shelter was asleep. I found 1 spot open on the 2nd level, but there was a puddle of water there from a leak in the roof. I decided to brush my teeth and hang my food bag before dealing with my sleeping arrangements. 
I took my food bag to the bear cables, which all had food bags hanging. I selected a cable with one small bag on it and unclipped the spring snap clip from the hook on the tree. I lowered food bag, put my bag on the hook, and pulled down on the cable. I then started to walk toward the tree with the cable to secure the snap hook. The cable pulled me back as it quickly stopped. I pulled on it and it appeared stuck. With my headlamp shining through the rain, I could see the snap clip was clipped onto the cable. When I pulled on the cable, I had inadvertently pulled the cable into the snap clip. There are several pull handles approximately every two feet along the cable, and I   could only pull the food hook up and down between two of the handles. The cable loop and pulley system was now non-functional. The snap clip was about 8 feet up, and out of my reach, and would only move between the handles. The food bags were not high enough to be safe from bears, so I needed to figure out how to get the cable out. I looked around camp for something to stand on with no luck. I took one of my trekking poles and reached up with it to push the clip open. The trick was to hold it open, while getting the cable out. This was rather difficult, since there was no leverage due to the cable being able to swing. I was using my headlamp, as raindrops fell on my face and into my eyes. After several attempts of trying to time the opening of the clip with pulling the cable out, I took the trekking pole and hooked it behind the cable while opening the clip. This gave me   more leverage to pull the cable out. After several attempts, I was finally able to release the cable. I pulled the food bags up and secured the cable. 
Now I had to figure where to sleep. The only dry place was crossways, between two other hikers, under the shortest part of the roofline. I set up my sleeping pad and quilt, banging my head occasionally on the rafters. I slid into my sleeping bag liner under my quilt, reminding myself not to sit up in the middle of the night, as the rafters were directly above my head. It was finally the end of one of my most difficult days on the trail. Tomorrow would be a new day...","Clingmans Dome/Smoky Mountains

I met my shelter mates who were all sound asleep when I arrived last night. There was a group of section hikers led by triple crowner (someone who has completed the Appalachian Trail, Pacific Coast Trail, and Continental Divide Trail) ""Karate Kid"". He was working as a guide for Jennifer Phar-Davis' company, leading a section hike. He and the group, most of who had British accents, were a pleasure to be around while I was preparing breakfast. There were a few other hikers, including a couple who took a rough side trail up the day before. The husband was given deaths threats by his wife if the next side trail going out was as rough as the one coming in. After a hot breakfast and coffee, I headed out. As is typically normal after a rough day on the trail, the next day is always fresh and new. The day was sunny and I enjoyed the fall colors as I traversed a couple of steep climbs while I made my way to Fontana Dam. The trail was good and I enjoyed the hike.

There were more open overlooks than I have passed recently, and I was able to enjoy the sun. Charlie's Bunion, a rocky outcropping, was one of the features along the way.  There was a narrow side trail that led to it, with a lot of day hikers making their way up to it. I arrived at TriCorner Shelter, which was quite full, with two spaces remaining. I selected a spot on the lower deck between a couple of men. There was a variety of people there, mostly section hikers, made up of couples and friends who were close to my age. Three young hikers from Ohio had a fire going when I arrived. After dinner I hung my food and polished off a swig of a ""warm you from the inside"" adult beverage offered by by a shelter mate. The night chill came quickly after the sun when down, so I climbed into my sleeping quilt. It was 7:41pm, probably the earliest I had been in bed the entire hike.

The fall colors continue to reach their peak, and I hiked through rhododendrons and rock formations along the way. I was pleasantly surprised to run into Napper, a hiker I had met early on in Pennsylvania. He and his brother, Dozer, were hiking together. Napper got sick, then found out he had a stress fracture and had to come off trail, while his brother continued.

I slept comfortably in Chris's camper during the night.  Chris and I walked to the ""Punkin Roll"", which was just a couple blocks away. All day long there heats of pumpkin rollers, sending their pumpkins down a steep road in town. The winner is the one whose pumpkin goes the furthest. I never thought watching pumpkins rolling down a hill would be so entertaining. I learned quickly that paying attention to the pumpkins was imperative. Errant and rogue pumpkins went in unpredictable directions, and I had to jump over one on the first heat I watched. Chris laughed and mentioned how ironic it would be for me to have hiked over 1400 miles, to be taken out by a pumpkin! Pumpkins were smashed all along the road. After watching some of the pumpkin roll heats, we joined her husband Tom for dinner at the Root and Barrel. Dinner was excellent and I added another craft beer to my list, D9 Brewing ""Brown Sugar, Brown Cow"", which was excellent. During the day I met Chris's RV neighbors, Bill and Mary Ann. Chris had told me they had been reading Puddle's trail journal all summer, so I wanted to make it a point to meet them. I saw Bill outside and walked over and said hello. He threw his arms up in the air and excitedly said ""River!"" and gave me a big hug. He went into the camper and got Mary Ann and we had a great conversation. They were a very energetic couple, and I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent with them. I hope to be as healthy and energetic as they are as I get on in age. Thanks Bill and Mary Ann for your support as I continue my journey. Puddles will be back!  
For those wondering why I am now hiking in Tennessee and North Carolina, since I haven't finished Virginia, I am trying to get some of the higher elevations done due to the impending cold weather. I have some time off trail coming up due to previous commitments, and want to give myself the best chance for finishing the trail this year by not having higher elevations left to do in late November and early December. I also have friends like Christine who are available and willing to help me get through these sections, making it easier to move around to different sections.","

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605260,"I've been looking forward to this day of my hike since I began May 1st, the Grayson Highlands. I had hiked through this area when I took my lightweight backpacking class in 2011. The area is comprised of several balds with wild ponies grazing along the way. The area was clear cut with extensive logging in the late 19th century. It was then used for cattle ranching before being turned into a state park in 1965. The ponies were brought in by the U.S. Forest Service in 1975 to control the growth of brush along the balds. The ponies have flourished in the area. The Wilburn Ridge Pony Association maintains the herd. The ponies are considered ""wild"" because they don't rely on humans for food, water, or shelter, but a many of them are friendly toward humans.  The morning started off in the low 30's with a wind chill to boot. There were sustained winds of 20 mph, with forecasted gusts of 37 mph. I had a rental car, which I dropped at Fox Creek/VA 603 and would hike to. My shuttle driver, Matt, picked my up and drove me to Elk Garden, where I started my 17 mile hike.  On the way to the trailhead, Matt asked me if I was interested in seeing rock that was 150 million years old, which I was. He pulled over and showed me a dark brown, rock mountainside. There was a hold drilled into the rock where a core sample had been taken for analysis. He explained how it was formed, and that he had met the geologist who was studying it. I enjoyed him sharing his knowledge of the geology in the area before he dropped me off.
The snow and ice crunched below my feet as I hiked. The air was nippy, but the trees at the beginning of my hike helped shelter me from the wind. I hiked four miles to the Thomas Knob Shelter where I stopped for a quick break. It was cold sitting still, so I didn't stay long. There were a few hikers waiting for some others to get water. They were bundled up and walking in place to keep warm while waiting. The trees were covered with icy frost. After leaving Thomas Knob shelter, I started to feel the cold of the wind, easily putting the wind chills into the 20's. Before stepping out of the trees and onto the open balds, I made sure I had everything cinched down. It was sunny, but with the wind and the cold temps, it was still extremely cold. I would remain above treeline most of the day. It warmed slightly, but was never comfortable. As I made my way across the balds, throughout the day, I was able to see groups of ponies grazing along the way. They were beautiful animals in a variety of colors. Today was one of the biggest highlights of my hike. I stopped several times to take photos and admire the ponies. Toward the end of my day, I was able to get back into tree-line to give some protection from the wind, which felt like had picked up. As I passed Old Orchard Shelter, it was packed with hikers. There were a couple fires going, with hikers huddled around to keep warm. I spent a lot of time with the ponies during the day, which made it a late day with me arriving at my car in the dark. Even though it was cold and windy, I had a great day enjoying the ponies. This will be my last day on trail for a couple weeks due to previous commitments. I'll return the week of November 19th to finish the remaining 439 miles.","Elk Garden, VA 600

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605436,"Today was my first day back on trail after two weeks off. I had a great vacation in Florida, and now ready to get back to finishing the  trail. I drove my car from home for more flexibility for shuttles and moving around. I returned to Fontana Dam, where I left off in October, after completing the Smokies. I drove in from Alcoa, TN in the morning, along the Little Tennessee River.  A light fog hung over the river as the sun came out. It was a gorgeous drive, and one I highly recommend in the fall. Along the way I saw an eagle perched in a tree across the river. I thought it was important to look into the spirit meaning of the eagle. Basically, it’s time to look inward and allow my heart to guide me. 
""An eagle is indicates that opportunities may present themselves when least expected. Those who are guided by the Eagle spirit animal are grounded. Even though the Eagle can soar to great heights, they are still strongly connected to the earth. Those guided by the Eagle are also resilient and in complete harmony with the spiritual aspects of their lives. Unafraid of the unknown, these seekers accept life’s challenges with unshakable courage, determination and confidence. Eagle totems appear to inspire (push) you to reach higher and become more than you think you are capable of. They tell you to be courageous and really stretch your limits and see what you can do. They bring a sense of courage and a desire to explore and grow. To dream of a flying eagle or one who is perched high signifies good fortune or victory coming your way. The lesson of the eagle is to take a look from where it sees. You must have the courage to relinquish stale and comfortable habits and beliefs to soar into unknown realms and new realities - continually expanding your view. Now is the time to take full responsibility for your life and be prepared for instant destiny.""
Seeing the eagle this morning seemed apropos. The hike today was a little rough, but I expected that after being off trail for two weeks. There were some steep climbs, and it pushed the limits of my glutes. I wanted to start back on trail here though, because of the elevations and the fact that it would get my trail legs back under me quickly. The day was sunny and pleasant. I stopped by the ""Fontana Hilton"", a nice, modern shelter perched over the lake with bathrooms, a solar charger for electronics, and a nice fire pit. If I was camping in shelter, this would definitely be a place I would want to stay. When Blueberry and I made a run at and end-around of Hurricane Florence, we were planning to camp here our first night. Our effort was thwarted by the closure of the trail. 
As I approached a road crossing, a short way from the Fontana Dam Shelter, I saw an 8x11 posted attached to a sign post. I stopped to read it, as sometimes people are looking for lost dogs or passing on important information to hikers. The photo was of a man named James, trail name ""BamaHiker"". it was his dream to hike the AT after he retired, but unfortunately, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer two years before retirement, and passed away. His wife had posted the poster, and put his boots at the foot of the sign post, filled with pebbles. Her husband had done some short hikes, completing over 165 miles of the trail. Fontana Dam was the last point he had hiked on the AT. She encouraged hiker to take a pebble and carry it, being symbolic of James hiking the AT, and help her husband's dream come true. She provided an email address for hikers to take a photo at the end of their hike, and email to her. I reached into one of the boots and selected a dark reddish/brown pebble, put it in my pocket and took a photo of the poster. ""BamaHiker"" will remain with me for the remainder of my hike.
The leaves have become a much deeper layer during the two weeks I've been off, to the point I can't see rocks and roots underneath. I love the sound of the leaves as I walk along, but it is difficult hiking as the invisible roots and rocks make my ankles and feet twist and turn. It appears I am going to step on flat, solid ground, then ""whoop"", I'm slipping on a root or torquing my foot. It does require slowing down to be more assured of footing.

After hiking with wet feet yesterday, I decided to try and keep my as dry as possible today, so I developed a technique of occasionally tapping my with my trekking poles as I hike to knock the snow off the top of my shoes. I am wearing trail running shoes with short gaiters, not quite appropriate for the current trail condition, but they have a good tread. My feet stay warm with my wool socks, even if they're wet. I plan to go home when the storm hits, and pick up boots and taller gaiters to finish my hike. 
I ran into some thru hikers who were heading south. They all appeared to be in their 20's. Pony Keg and Gritty were the first two I saw. Pony Keg spotted my orange ""Thru Hiker"" tag from down the trail and shouted out ""Hiker Trash!"". This is a term that a lot of the young hikers embrace, but not so much the older hikers. I have detested this term all summer, but now, I suddenly embrace it and feel proud. I think it's combination of having hiked nearly 2,000 miles, and that a young hiker recognized that I was accomplishing the same goal as he. Not that it has been an issue, because everyone who is doing a thru hike knows what others hikers are going through, despite their age, background, or lifestyle. One of my main reasons for hiking the trail was to experience the culture of the trail. Now I feel like I have been absorbed into the culture of the trail.
I mentioned the incoming storm and Pony Keg and Gritty expressed their excitement about it. That was the glaring difference between our ages. I was not looking forward to the storm. I suppose when I was his age, I probably would have been excited about the storm, but now, 30 years his senior, I had no interest. I told him I where I would be hiking to in a few days which included ""Dragon Tooth"" and he excitedly told me about climbing, using rebar handholds, etc. The only thing I could think was how there would be snow on it by the time I got there, and how dangerous it might be!  They were trying to get to Damascus before the storm came in. We parted ways and I exchanged greetings with three more from the group, Fish Fry, Tree Breaker, and the last one whose name I can't remember. It was nice to run into some thru hikers, as there are so few of us left out here now. It's instant camaraderie, and they were such nice young men. I wish them well in the rest of their hike.
Jo met me in the middle of the day as I crossed a road near the hotel where we were staying, bringing me some cold drinks. She had been ""scouting"" tomorrow's location and the report wasn't good. It was a narrow mountain road with ruts and ice. She didn't feel comfortable driving her vehicle there, and the hiking distances between other road accesses were either too short or too long. I had her call around to hostels and shuttlers and she found ""Bubba"", who will be dropping me off at the rutty mountain road tomorrow.
I continued and finished in the dark for the second day in a row. I don't mind hiking in the dark, although it is sometimes a little more difficult, depending on the terrain. The days are shorter, and it's hard to hike over 20 miles without being in the dark at the beginning or end of the day. Puddles and I have been in contact with each other. She will be summiting Springer Mountain today, then waiting out the storm in Georgia. I will go home and get out of the path of the storm, do an equipment change, then Puddles in Virginia, where we have approximately 150 miles in common that we will hike together.","Mt.

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605821,"After checking the weather forecast one last time, Jo and I dropped my vehicle at the end point of my hike, and she drove me to where Bubba was waiting to drive me to the trailhead on Rte 623. I was bummed not to spend more time with Jo as she planned to help me day hike this section from December 6th-10th, but Diego was arriving at midnight tonight, and we both wanted to get out of the path of the storm. I texted Puddles to let her know the forecast had the bigger snowfall staying toward the south. I told her of my plan to return to the Catawba, VA  and start hiking south from there no later than Tuesday the 11th, as only a few inches of snow were forecasted in that area. 
Bubba had a jeep and we made our way up the dirt mountain, taking about 35 minutes to get there. At first I thought I would be able to drive my SUV up the road when I returned, but the road became increasingly worse and I changed my mind. I'll use Bubba again when I come back. Shuttle driving is his livelihood and I don't mind supporting local people, especially those who provide a valuable service to hikers. He told me some recent stories about people hiking and getting injured, and not being found right away. Before departing, he asked me to text him when I was done hiking to make sure I was safe. 
It was cold and the trail was covered with snow, sometimes with small drifts. The sun wasn't shining like it had been the past two days, and the trail was rocky and a little difficult in some areas due to the snow. I had some steep ascents and descents again today, and the snow was deeper than the past two days. It was also very powdery and slippery, so I dubbed it ""silicone snow"". It was hard to get traction and instead of sliding on mud as I have done throughout my hike, I was now sliding on snow. The first eight miles were slow and sometimes tedious due to the snow and steepness. I'm getting worn out from the climbs, so today I decided to not look at how far they go uphill. I just put my head down and kept moving. I suspect this is what Puddles did this summer when we had climbs. She didn't like to see the ""never-ending"" climbs, so whenever we got to one, I told her ""don't look"". This strategy seemed to work well for me today. Yesterday I kept looking up and ended up breaking down and sobbing on the trail twice. It's amazing the extreme emotions that are experienced on the trail, sometimes all in one day, or even hour to hour.    
I arrived at Chestnut Knob Shelter, an enclosed stone shelter at the top of Chestnut Knob. I had been looking forward seeing this as it was an unusual shelter, made of multicolored stone. It was an old fire warden's cabin which had been converted to an enclosed shelter. When I arrived, there was a hiker putting out a fire in the fire pit. It was midday and obvious that he had spent the night at the shelter. We introduced ourselves and he started asking me questions about towns, and resupply, noting he needed to get food. I gave him some basic information and pulled out my phone to which he said, ""you have information I need"". I was a little annoyed that he didn't have a map or any basic information about where he was, or where he was going, other than south, following the white blazes. He appeared prepared, but was ""old school"" and I'm not sure that he even phone with him. Everyone has to hike their own hike and he was doing it without modern technology, which I can't help but admire. I just thought that he should have some basic knowledge about where he was going to resupply, and I wasn't in a mood to be a caretaker of anyone. It was an odd exchange that threw me off at that point, and I did not spend any time exploring the shelter. He made a move to start hiking. I wished him well and took off at a quick pace through an open field of snow that was ahead of me, getting ahead of him on the trail. I don't think he had any ill intentions, but he was the only person I saw on the trail up to this point and I wanted to stay ahead of him so that I would arrive at my vehicle alone. As I hiked, I realized I didn't take the time to look at the shelter, but still felt I made the best decision to leave. After getting through the field and back into the woods, the snow slowly disappeared to the point there was none for the last half of the hike. I began to wonder if the hiker knew about the snowstorm coming in, and started to feel a bit guilty that I hadn't mentioned it to him. It wasn't on purpose, I just didn't think of it at the time. I stopped for a break and waited a few extra minutes to see if he would catch up. I wanted to finish hiking before dark, so I continued to the next shelter and left him a note, repeating the same information I had shared with him earlier about the main road coming up that had a hostel. I also told him where the next town was the trail went through, and that there was a snowstorm coming. Puddles had texted me a screenshot of a weather forecast while I was hiking. I didn't read the forecast, but she mentioned going to Roanoke on Sunday (tomorrow) or Monday, which was near where we would start hiking, so apparently the forecast wasn't too bad. I finished my hike and read the trail forecast which indicated only 2-4 inches where we were to hike. The storm was due to arrive in my current location at 12:00am, and I headed toward home at about 5:45pm. I spoke to Jo during my drive and she indicated the forecast was for the storm to go further north, and Roanoke was expecting 6-8 inches but could go as high as 13"". Now it's a waiting game to see what happens, but I will be home tonight.","VA Rte 42, Ceres VA

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605875,"I monitored the weather throughout the morning on computer and television and it didn't look good. One meteorologist even circled the exact area where I still need to hike and talked about the high amounts of snow that would be falling there, especially in the higher elevations. Some of the locations I have remaining to hike are calling for up to 18"" of snow. I texted Puddles, who was monitoring live cams in addition to checking forecasts and said it definitely was not good. She asked if I was thinking about waiting until spring, which I was contemplating. We also talked on the phone, and by late afternoon she texted that the live webcams in Virginia were showing lots of snow, that she bought a ticket to go home, and would be back on trail in March. I told her that unless there was a miraculous melting of the snow, I too would probably be back in spring. I will continue to monitor the weather for the next couple of days, but even if the snow melts, it can create other issues such as flooding.","

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605899,"I'm officially off trail until spring. I had approximately 10-12 days of hiking remaining, and was looking to complete my hike on December 20th. With up to 24"" of snow in the areas I have left to hike, and damage from an ice storm that occurred in November in some areas, I have chosen to put my hike on a temporary hold. I'm disappointed, but not devastated. It's a continued lesson of the trail's unpredictability, and the ability to deal with it. There are so many things you have no control over while hiking the AT, including trail conditions, and weather. The only thing I can control is my response to these challenges, and making the best decision possible. I decided early on to ""go with the flow"" during my hike. This is one of many times I have done that, and it has served me well to this point. It doesn't mean I haven't been frustrated to the point of crying, wanting to quit and go home, or ran an entire gambit of emotions in one day. I have learned to cope with the emotional and physical demands the trail presents, and continue on, sometimes blurred by tears, but knowing the next day is a new day, with a fresh new start. This has enabled me to the complete 1978 miles, with 212 miles to go. The comradery on trail has been amazing, with new friends and many great memories I will cherish forever. I look forward to adding to those memories when I finish my thru hike in early spring.

River ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608314,"I am back on trail to finish the last 212 miles to complete my AT hike.  My body was beat up when I came off trail in December.  I felt like a big ball of inflammation, and could barely walk.  Stairs were the most challenging as I had to walk down sideways. I couldn't squat down due to the lack of mobility.  I began getting body work done including Muscle Activation, massages, dry needling, and adjustments. I started Bikram Yoga sessions 10 days, and CrossFit 5 weeks after coming off trail. I gradually cleaned up my eating and coming back trail I feel very strong, with no inflammation. I will be eating a ketogenic diet this time out to keep my energy levels up, inflammation down, and maintain a steady blood sugar level to avoids cravings and drops in energy. My first day back was sunny in the morning and cloudy in the afternoon.  There were waterfalls, lots of walking along streams, and the first signs of spring with daffodils and robins.  I stopped at Mountaineer Falls and took a short side trail to Jones Falls which was totally worth the short walk. It rained lightly as I left Jones Falls, but not enough to get wet. I'm staying at Boots Off Hostel, which will be my base camp for a few days.  I will complete this section south of Damascus, and a couple more hikes north of Damascus before I move north to Daleville, VA to meet up with Puddles, where will hike some miles in common that we have left.  The air is fresh and the trail is good.

I am so grateful that Tressa and my dad were able to join me for my last day.  It was beautiful and sunny, and an amazing last hike into Damascus Virginia. My ""finish line"" was the Appalachian Trail ""Welcome to Damascus"" archway at the Damascus Town Park. It's hard to summarize my feelings after so many months and miles. I already posted on Instagram and repeat here... 
With so many mixed emotions, words are so inadequate. I'll need time to absorb and process this experience. One thing I do know, it has changed me, probably in ways I don't yet understand. You can't change the trail. It just is. It will change you. This was a journey that was not undertaken alone. I hiked the miles, but the incredible support I received from others is beyond comprehension. Support from friends and family, hostel owners and shuttles drivers, trail maintainers, long and short term hiking partners (and ""trail spouse""!), trail angels, and complete strangers. The list goes on and on. My faith in humanity was restored. I especially want to thank Tressa. I could not have done this without her encouragement and complete support. 
It was the culture and community surrounding the trail that drew me to it, and ultimately sustained me. Thank you to everyone who played a part in my amazing journey.

*My last day was actually 10.8 miles, but missed entering 3.5 miles somewhere along the way, so I entered 14.3 to make the final total come out to the entire 2190.9 official miles for 2018 of the Appalachian Trail.","McQueens Gap
