CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591063,"For the last 11 months there has been this question in the back of my mind.  After my hike in 2017 from Springer Mountain in Georgia to High Point State Park in New Jersey, it seemed like there was some unfinished business.  It was like do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti……and then just stopping.
I’m sure I could live with that.  Watch the news, listen to your neighbors, talk to friends and family, and there are a lot of things going on more pressing than that.  But, if I wake up at 4:00 in the morning and can’t sleep, I find myself remembering what I saw and experienced in Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and part of New Jersey last year, and I can’t help but turn my mind northward and dream about the rest of New Jersey and then New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.  The Appalachian Trail is all of that.  Each part has it’s own value and worth, but the whole trail is the whole trail.  I’ve always wanted to hike it all.  Maybe I should go again and finish it.  
Marlene and I have talked about it a lot over this time. If I don’t bring it up, she does.  She’s not pushing me, but she catches the same vision for it that i do.  She immerses herself in the experience and is my biggest cheerleader.  She is my home base and support team.  There is nothing but encouragement coming from her.
Since last June there has been a long list of life events and obstacles, so I have been cautious about getting too set on it.  Very recently I got past the last of these and got the okay to go.  Since then I have been doing a crash course in planning and prep.  Things have fallen into place.  With each day I am getting more excited.  I’m starting to think of being on the trail at sunset, and waking up to a sunrise in the woods.  I have the bug again.  Even getting an appetite for Pop Tarts, SPAM and tortilla wraps, beef jerky, instant potatoes, dried fruit, granola bars and milky way bars.  Can’t wait.
So it’s all set.  Wednesday morning (very early) I will be taking a direct flight from Birmingham to the Newburgh/Stewart airport in New York, with a little side detour to Detroit.  I will be picked up by the proprietor of Mosey’s Place - a hostel near Port Jervis, NY - and will spend the night there.  Then they will shuttle me to the headquarters of High Point State Park in NJ on Thursday morning.  There I will be met by a box of gear that I sent yesterday, containing stuff that the TSA probably would frown upon at their airport security check, and some stuff I just didn’t want to carry on the plane, looking like a hobo with a huge backpack as luggage.  After that things are a lot less planned out.  That’s just the way I like it because life on the trail is very much “rolling with the punches”, “going with the flow” and staying open to new experiences as things come up.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591157,"I kind of want this trip to be a continuation of last year’s trip so it can feel like a hike from Georgia to Maine, since that is what I originally set out to do.  In last year’s AWOL Guidebook, High Point State Park in NJ was 1,336.3 miles from Springer Mountain in GA.  This year that distance is 1,337.4 miles, or 1.1 miles further - probably due to some trail relocations along that part of the trail.  I am just going to “plug” that distance into one of these preliminary journal entries so that my position in the journal count matches the distances in my 2018 AWOL Guide.  I may try to report this year’s distance somehow so I can track current progress, but the calculated total shown at the top of each entry will reflect my position for the thru hike end to end.  Hope that’s clear.  
As it turns out the trail distance from High Point State Park in NJ to Katahdin in Maine is exactly the same as last year so the guidebook will be accurate as I track myself north.  The total distance this year is 2,190.9.  If you do the math that leaves 853.5 miles to finish up this year at Katahdin.  
Generally, hikers who start and end their hike in one calendar year (or possibly within a 12 month period, depending), and hike all the miles between Springer and Katahdin regardless of direction and sequence, are called “Thru Hikers”.  When you meet other hikers along the trail or around the campfire a typical question is “Where are you headed?, or “Going to Maine?”  If you answer that yes, I am hiking to Maine, they typically assume you are a thru hiker.  There is usually a good mix of hikers around - thru hikers, weekenders, section hikers, day hikers, etc.  Thru Hikers are afforded a certain amount of respect, though few actually seek it out - and they are only attempting to be thru hikers until they actually finish up.  Last year I started on March 3, and I was a thru hiker, until I got injured and had to leave the trail.  Most hikers are not dogmatic about it.  They are just glad to meet other hikers and, within seconds, you can have a great rapport with anyone you meet along the trail.  It might be fun and helpful to meet up with a compatible hiker and hike together (or nearly together) to Maine, especially with some of the remote and tough stuff that lies ahead, so I want others to know that’s where I’m headed.  Normally I will try to explain my situation and my attempt to finish this year.  Someone could assume or misunderstand since there is often not time to go into it all in detail.  If I finish up this year at Katahdin, I will have hiked it all the way, and that’s what’s important to me.",,View Entry,"May 20, Sun",0
CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591165,"Before each hike I have tried to do as much walking as possible and also practice hikes carrying close to a trail-weight pack.  i suppose it helped, but my normal experience has been that there really isn’t any way to get ready for a hike except to hike.  When I get to the trail the early days are tough, carrying the weight, climbing and descending the mountains and breaking my feet, muscles, and joints in to handle the strain.  The last couple of months I have had some health issues that have prevented any real workouts.  I have gotten the go ahead from all my doctors recently and feel fine.  But I expect the first days or even weeks to be pretty tough.  I plan to give myself all the time I need and do short mile days at first.  There is nothing forcing me to an end date for the hike.  If I had continued north last year it would probably have taken about two more months to finish.  Starting over will take a little longer.  I tend to be my own worst enemy once I get out there, but I hope to make myself work up to it.  We’ll see how that goes.",,View Entry,"May 21, Mon",0
CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591399,"Ironically, I woke this morning at 4:00, the time i will HAVE to wake up tomorrow morning to head to the airport.  The reality is that going back to sleep is unlikely so my mind starts to run through the mental checklist of things I need to do today - great and small.  I am distracted by all of this but I am still “present”.  Knowing myself, I’ll probably wake up tomorrow with a military mindset and march through the task list to load up and get on the road to the airport, checking them off mentally or actually on a paper list.  I might not be as much fun to be around until that is accomplished, I’ll admit.  My mind will start to be in New Jersey, not “present”.  
At 5:00 Marlene stirs and I hear her moving around in the bedroom to get ready to head out to the Y.  I hear her slip out and the car leave the driveway.  I am retired and she is working probably until the end of the year.  Over our life together I have enjoyed being “domesticated” and doing little things around the house.  I like to surprise her.  When she is in the shower I make the bed and like to see a little smile or hear the sigh of relief when she comes out and notices.  There are lots of those tiny little things that have become a normal part of the routine.  The last spoon and plate from last evening are in the dishwasher.  I have stocked the pantry with a box of cheerios, and two rolls of paper towels from downstairs so she doesn’t have to fetch them.  The wastebasket and recycle basket are emptied and new bags are in - she hates to find them packed full when she goes to toss something and she’s in a hurry to leave.  I love having them empty for her. 
Early in our marriage as we were settling into routines and figuring out how to live together I discovered that we are different from each other - in several ways.  One of those is that I’m more like “a place for everything and everything it it’s place”.  She was more “relaxed”.  That’s the kind of thing that can cause a little friction as you work it out.  Soon I noticed a book on the coffee table titled something like “Cleanies and Messies”.  We were surrounded by many great married couples and lots of resources to help young couples adjust to marriage, and I’m sure some older and wiser woman suggested it to her.  It talked about the practical aspects of setting up a household and also how to grow together as a couple rather than apart.  She worked on becoming more of a “Cleanie”, and I learned that I could help.  
She came home from her morning workout, showered and got ready.  I was sitting at the kitchen table on the computer, having just found out that my box of gear and supplies is “Out for Delivery” by FEDEX up in New Jersey.  She came up behind me, slipped her arms around me and kissed me on the neck.  She thanked me for stocking the bathrooms with toilet paper and boxes of tissues.  I had packed in as many of each as I could.  Not enough for three months though, so she will think about me again when she runs out and has to go downstairs to get them.  
It is hard for her when I’m gone like this.  Cheerios and tissues and spare light bulbs aside, there is a lot to do to stay behind and live life while I’m gone.  Added to that Marlene is my base camp and trail boss. She helps with everything from sending mail drops for food and supplies to finding a hostel or motel if I need to get off the trail for a night.  Every time there is a water heater or A/C repair or some other thing to handle, and she has to handle it all.  Thankfully we have many friends who take care of her a little like a “damsel in distress”.  She’s not helpless, but it’s great to have friends to call on who know the situation and are willing to help.  Tomorrow the separation begins again, but we will have a “wireless” connection across the miles that couples know about.  There is some comfort in that.  
PS. Thinking about it I remember how much it meant to me last year when friends would sign the guestbook here on the journal to let me know they are following along.  It helps so much to have a little contact along the way.  I appreciate it.",,View Entry,"May 22, Tue",0

Up before 4 a.m. but already awake for over an hour starting the day in my mind. Mixture of anticipation and excitement.  Quick shower and a small checklist completed and we’re off. Marlene and I have done this before.  We have a fairly relaxed ride to the airport but we’re a little later than I would normally be so I’m kind of tight.  As anticipated, we had a long clinging hug and a knowing smile as she drove away. Around the corner inside and I spot the longest TSA security check line I’ve ever seen. What?  Birmingham at 5:00 a.m?  It goes fast and I sail thru with my weird carry on luggage (backpack). Flight to Detroit goes smoothly as I am entertained by a cute 5 year old girl sitting next to me on her first flying experience.   Three hour layover, then I am seated next to Juan on the plane. We hit it off and talk non stop the whole way. He is on a business trip and works as the financial executive for the Carmelite Nuns old folks homes organization and has a background in computers and software development too. In NY at Newburgh I contact Mosey from the hostel and go outside to wait her arrival beside the quaint and very small “one room schoolhouse” airport building. Juan joins me to wait for his cousin and we have more lively conversation. His “cousin” arrives - a van containing 5 of his female family members - all exuberant souls like Juan.   Somehow they have gotten the idea that I am also Juan’s cousin. So after they all line up to hug and kiss Juan in turn, then I’m next (No worries, peck on the cheek!).  It was fun as far as that goes, but imagine the 5 different looks on their faces as they began to get to know me. We had a good laugh over that.  
Mosey arrived and I mentioned my shipment was delivered to the High Point State Park headquarters and she tells me that another hiker will be getting there in a few minutes. I ride along and collect my gear. That allows me to go thru it all today instead of in the morning when she drops me off to start the hike. So things have gone very well so far.  I am ready to head out in the morning on the early shuttle with Now, a hiker from Connecticut. Also here are two young hikers from Germany and Hook from TX who is about  my age, who came in later.   We are all getting along great and their company has put me back into the hiker mode almost like I never left.
Talked a couple of times with Marlene, Charity and Angela. I’m set to go tomorrow. A little nervous as my pack feels heavy and the terrain around here is very rocky.  The trees have a good canopy so I hope to avoid sunburn. Sounds like very hot and very cold temps here lately.   I so look forward to the first steps on the trail tomorrow. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Birmingham

Good first day. It was hot this afternoon so that sapped my energy. There were some nasty rocky areas but many easier parts too. The climbs were fairly tame. It was a very walkable section. First days are first days so I was kind of a wimp as expected - kind of a “fat guys in the woods” character. Did not expect to make it into town but was open to it. My butt was dragging when I got here. 
Mosey’s is a very nice hostel. Started out with a home cooked breakfast which was great.  Quick trip up to High Point State Park on the early shuttle where I took my time to unpack and repack my gear and waiting until 8 to send home my civilian clothes and a few gear items I decided not to carry.  The first couple of miles reminded me of the Pennsylvania rocks with a few decent climbs. Then things opened up a little with some easier sections mixed in. I tried to stay relaxed and go slow and steady, not planning any destination that I felt like I had to make. As there were no huge mountains and the tread was nice I later tried for Unionville NY because they allow hikers to set up tents behind City Hall for free. Also there are restaurants so I had real food for supper with plans for breakfast and a carry out for tomorrow’s lunch. I can eat trail food anytime!  I’m inside New York State tonite but the trail is still in NJ for another 25 miles or so but it goes right up the border wobbling back and forth between states until it finally leaves NJ for good.  Some sections today were fairly remote and some were near farm property and also the backyards of private homes. I have also hit some of the NJ swamps and mud holes. Sections were very muddy and with standing and flowing water - cattail swamps.  Long sections were above the mud and muck  on boardwalks made of a couple of planks set side by side and sitting on logs or timbers similar to railroad ties sitting down in the mud or sometimes sunken into the mud. Other times you just had to slosh through. Lots of flowing streams with footbridges or rock hopping to cross. I ate lunch at a footbridge dangling my feet and then took a nap before moving on. So far 4 of us have our tents set up and are ready for the night. I don’t have plans set for tomorrow yet. I did well enough today with not too many aches and pains but I was exhausted when I got here. I still plan to take it easy and take a day off as needed.  Hope I can sleep well tonight.

I had a difficult night last night. Did not get any sleep at all. I remember last year the same thing happened as I tossed and turned with an active mind and not settling down or getting comfortable.   First two nights the same.   Decided to do a short day to the next shelter and rest. Got to the shelter by lunch time. Was unable to sleep any as other hikers came in and then moved on but conversations going on. Still unable to get my mind to stop.  Hope I can shut down tonight.   Feeling exhausted. 
We awoke at daylight. Packed up but left tents standing so the sun could dry the dew while we went to the deli for coffee and breakfast.  I left around 8 as I had no rush with the low miles planned. Long road walk back to the trail and a good climb right away. After that there were some meadows and a good view of a long and beautiful valley with a high long ridge on the other side. Turns out the shelter is on that ridge and a way on down to the north. Much the same terrain as yesterday with rocks, swamps with boardwalks and many streams with footbridges. Skirted the Wallkill Reserve which is a flat trail along the side of a huge wetlands with lots of birds, snakes and who knows what else living there. It was a mile long rectangle and hiking one side, across the end and then up the other side.  The wetlands actually straddles the NJ/NY border. Then onto a mile long plank boardwalk through another swamp before a challenging climb to the ridge top I saw this morning to this shelter.  A short way up the ridge from the swamp area there is a side trail about 100 yards to an abandoned home but they still maintain a spigot on the back foundation so hikers can get water. I carried every available container full to the shelter as there is no water source here. Heavy, especially on the steep trail to the mountain top.  
No rest so far and the heat has been stifling these last two days.   Recovery is pretty quick though when I drop the pack to rest and then have lunch.  Feet, knees etc doing well, lung power so-so. 
Was able to send pictures and a video to Marlene and we had a chance to talk so I enjoyed that.   Doing well overall, just need sleep. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Unionville NY - at City Hall

Up early this morning after another nearly sleepless night. Hope that improves soon. Morning chores went well. I was away by 6:30. I hope to start early while I get used to the heat and get as many miles in by noon as I can.   By then it’s really hot.  
Pochuck Mountain was a good climb with nice woodsy sections mixed in. Many country gravel roads to cross and lots of streams and footbridges. There was a mile-long section of raised boardwalk with a suspension bridge over Pochuck Creek. Then lots of the smaller plank boardwalks I have been seeing every day. Didn’t know New Jersey had so many lowlands. I am tenting at Rickey Farm in a grassy field behind their old traditional red barn with three cupolas along the ridge line. 
Even got a shower so I feel almost human again, at least temporarily.   I am right at the bottom of huge Waywayanda Mountain - my obstacle right away tomorrow morning. I can look up and see massive bare rock cliffs.  The last section at the top is called “stairway to heaven” and apparently some of it involves ladders.  Can’t wait to see that. 
NJ and NY are strict to require hikers to only camp in designated campsites, threatening large fines for offenders. I am concerned that with my need to hike low mileage days for awhile and the placement of shelters and campsites as much as two or three days apart I could have problems. They also don’t allow hitchhiking so my normal means of going in for resupply or to overnight in town is also a problem. We’ll see how it works out. 
I was able to send Marlene pictures and videos today but the signal is very weak here tonight.  I need sleep badly so will turn in soon. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Pochunk Mountain Shelter

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592036,"2018 Miles:  25.6
Today I fought with myself a little over the need to hike short mile days as I break in to life on the trail.  Shelters and campsites are spaced better for hikers going 25 miles than for me. Taking it slower is good for getting my body up for this kind of exertion without getting hurt.  It also is about all I can do right now as I was not able to do much prep to be ready.  It is 5 miles to this shelter from last nights tent spot. I would prefer to have hiked on about 3 more miles but NJ has pretty strict rules and apparently they enforce them.  I’m not allowed to pull over somewhere in the woods and set up for the night.  The next shelter ahead is way beyond my limit so we will see how tomorrow goes. 
This mornings climb was a tough one. Very steep. Most of it a rock pile the whole way.  My breakfast somehow was making me feel yucky (trail food can do that).  Then it started to rain. I called Marlene just to hear her voice and we talked thru some of the issues. Just taking a break and having that time together helped. From there to the top went by quickly. I went to the “stairway to heaven” overlook and got a video. It was cloudy but I could see the whole valley below and several layers of ridge lines and valleys beyond. I was unable to see (or video) the High Point State Park monument, which was supposed to be visible in clear weather. After I sent Marlene the video I sat there for a half hour just to relax and enjoy. Then way off I saw a further ridge line and the monument a little darker gray in the lighter gray cloud shrouded distance. So then I was seeing the entire distance I have hiked since the beginning. That was really great to see. 
The rest of today was normal rocky sections with some very nice smooth sections mixed in.  I like hiking in the light rain which made the temperature cool and comfortable. Since it has been really hot the whole time, today would have been a good time to do a few extra miles. 
I am tenting at Waywayanda Shelter with about 8 others - mostly in their 20’s.   I thought is was thru raining but a light rain has started again. It is cool, almost cold so I hope to sleep well tonight.  Goodnight Sweetheart.","NJ 94 - Rickey’s Farm

It rained continuously overnight giving me a restful sleep. I was in my tent at 5:30 and woke up around 11 p.m. to the patter of rain on the tent fabric. It was cool but very comfortable sleeping weather. I awoke several times as is normal for me but finally caught up on some rest.   Packed up a wet tent again. Stopped at the Waywayanda State Park office to use their facilities and get water and was off. Normal rocky trail with streams and footbridges and the plank boardwalks over swampy areas. Then a major milestone when I came to the New Jersey/New York state line up on a high rocky ridge line. These are always so good to cross, but especially this one as I was in NJ for about 11 months. Called Marlene and sent a video too.  We talked for a long time and I got my state line kiss!  The rest of the day was tougher with high rocky ridge lines that went up and down a lot and often were like a knifes edge.  One ridge was very steep to climb and included a section with rods drilled into the rock face ladder-like. I am camped alone so far at Cascade Brook - a nice quiet campsite next to a stream. Tomorrow I need to do a NERO, which means a short mile day (near zero) and then into a town to resupply, laundry etc. Not sure yet of the specifics yet but it will work out.   Need a good nights sleep again.

Town day!  Nice campsite next to Cascade Brook, but a little buggy. New Jersey and New York have been all about the bugs. Ultra Runner, a thru hiker and long distance runner (like 200 miles) came in later and set up off in the woods. I slept so-so. Also heard various unusual animal sounds during the night and something that sounded the way I would imagine my food bag would sound hitting the ground if a bear was able to get it loose. Got up for a pit stop but thought better of challenging for the food.  It was still there in the morning.  Maybe it was just one of the smaller mosquitoes crashing around. 
Short hike this morning and mostly easy, with a very rocky and tough section just to keep me honest.  There is a small informal parking lot at the road. I noticed a hiker leaving headed north and yelling a few last minute things to the family member who was dropping him off.  That person then turned and saw me. He began to ask questions and Benjamin from Maryland offered to drive me to town before leaving for home. So that was easy. 
It took a long time to find a place to stay. As I was walking along the street a woman in a white sedan stopped and called to me to find out if I am a hiker. When I said yes, she asked if she could talk to me. With my ok she pulled over and got out to ask me about myself and my hike. She asked good questions. I could tell she knows something about hiking. Finally Caroline pulls out a 10 dollar bill and informs me that she finds hikers during the season and buys them lunch, handing me the money. After a hug this white haired “Gramma” type gets in her car and drives off with a wave goodbye.  Then I went to the library to use the computer and also called the AT Headquarters in Harpers Ferry. They gave me several phone numbers of hiker shuttle drivers that I did not have. So I have arranged to be dropped off north a few miles on the trail tomorrow morning so I can hike back to town and then shuttle back the next morning to head north after finalizing my resupply.   Being on foot, I have walked a lot today but so much easier without a pack. Getting a shower and the prospect of a real bed is the icing on the cake.  My phone signal has been weak yesterday and today.  Hot today but I think cooler (and wetter) days are ahead.

Today I shuttled north from town 7 trail miles to West Mombasha Road and hiked south back to town carrying a lighter pack.  The plan was to then shuttle back to the same spot tomorrow morning and head north. Today’s hike was beautiful.  I passed Fitzgerald Falls in the remote woods - a quiet peaceful spot. Sent Marlene a video. Great views from Cat Rocks and the Eastern Pinnacles, both large rock slabs along the spine of a high ridge and sticking oddly out of the surrounding trees when viewed from each other.
I did well but struggled more than expected from the effects of what appears to be a chest cold. I have felt it coming on for a couple of days but it’s sort of taking over now. There were two moderate but steep climbs and I seemed to be going in slow motion, stopping sometimes every few feet to catch my breath. Progress was disappointing. A landmark half a mile ahead took so long to reach that I assumed I had missed it. I was strong enough to do the work but I seemed to be in a fog a little. At the road it took about 30 minutes to get a ride (hitchhiking illegal in NY). In town I called Marlene, knowing exactly what she would say but enjoying the process. At CVS I got something to break up the congestion. Back at my room I called my Dr and I will pick up a prescription in the morning. I will take tomorrow to rest and head north again after that. Sometimes it’s just easier when you have a plan. So that’s my plan. Maine will still be there if it takes me an extra day. Goodnight Sweetheart.","NY Highway 17A

Had breakfast at the Village Buzz Cafe, a relaxed small town place where everybody seems to know each other. Sat there for nearly two hours just eating and having coffee and catching up on plans.  The proprietor thru hiked the trail in 1994. She was interested in my story, asking lots of questions as we compared notes.  When I asked for the check she said one of the locals who had come in during my stay had taken care of my breakfast tab. Don’t know who it was but the towns people are so helpful and supportive of hikers.  I left her a nice tip and plan to get a breakfast to go tomorrow morning as I leave town.  On to CVS and they had my prescription ready. Stopped by the library to use the computer, then on to my room to rest. My Dr said I could hike today if I felt good. I decided not to hike and am glad I did. Feeling some better but I guess doing it tomorrow will be the test.  Thanks to all who have prayed for me and expressed concern.  Goodnight Sweetheart. 
PS. I am going to copy something I have seen in another hiker’s journal that has been interesting as I follow them along.  Will see if it seems to add to my journal record.

Everything was going smoothly as I was picked up by Coach, the shuttle driver. We stopped by The Village Buzz and I was soon on my way with a breakfast sandwich and cup of coffee, eating while we drove. I left the trash with Coach and was on my way north again. It didn’t take long to know that the meds for my chest cold were going to sap my energy. Slow and steady over some very difficult rocky terrain. I was able to do only 1 mile per hour. By noon I was spent but nothing to do but plod along. More of the same difficult terrain. One interesting location called the Lemon Squeezer, a narrow crack of a passage between house-sized rocks. The rest was slugging it out with my pace slowing even more. I arrived completely spent at the Fingerboard Shelter around 7. Somehow I got set up and ate. Just before dark a mother bear with two cute and very small cubs began to circle the camp. She was able to steal several hanging bear bags of food, including mine. My neighbor and I hung ours in the same tree and the whole camp watched as this expert thief snuck in shortly after dark, climbed the tree and maneuvered the lines so she could slash the bags, dropping the contents to the ground. We were able to salvage some as the camp approached aggressively, running her off. This was repeated overnight and one more time as I was leaving the next morning. We found she has been reported several times but no action yet - food stolen 3 nights in a row. Talked with Marlene and we have a plan for her to ship a resupply box to the next town Monday. My main concern is getting up to hiking strength. Three more days on meds are scary to think about. Hopefully I will gain some strength when I am done taking them.

Today was much a repeat of yesterday, just shorter. Struggled mightily with no energy probably due to the meds. I arrived by 1 p.m. and got a hamburger, grilled by Adam and Andrew, two local guys out for the weekend.  That was so nice. Got set up and walked a  mile long round trip to filter water - down a rocky path and then back up. Then I got a nice nap. Rest is what I need.

Great hiking day!  My choices were to hike 3.2 miles to the next shelter or 10.2 miles to Fort Montgomery NY.  Last evening the prospect of hiking ten miles was almost overwhelming.  I have been weak from a chest cold and the meds. Overnight it rained and cooled off so much I actually had to use my sleeping bag for warmth rather than just as a pad.  It did not get out of the 60’s today - almost perfect hiking weather. I decided to go for town so I can pick up the package Marlene sent as early as possible.  Black Mountain, West Mountain, and Bear Mountain provided the days challenges.  Very high and each provided views of the New York City skyline in clear weather. I only saw the skyline from atop Bear Mountain. It was faint in the distance with the cloudy day. Bear Mountain is as difficult on the downhill trip on the north side as the climb up the south side. The trail maintenance clubs are completing a legendary volunteer labor to place hundreds of massive stone steps into the mountainside on the north slope. Just imagine walking down the stairs of the tallest skyscraper over a mile of distance. But so thankful for the stairs. The descent of the north slope gave a great view of the Hudson River and valley and the Bear Mountain Bridge which I will cross when I leave. The trail comes down off the mountain at Bear Mountain State Park, and Hessian Lake, with hundreds of Sunday afternoon family get togethers in full swing, grills fired up everywhere.   Winding through that I entered the Trailside Museum and Zoo, to finally come out at the toll booth for cars crossing the bridge. I think hikers can cross for free.  I was picked up by the motel shuttle. I have cleaned up, done laundry, had some real food and then had a long talk with Marlene. After hearing the story of all she went thru to get my resupply box ready and shipped in “emergency mode“ yesterday I can tell you she does deserve “Wife of the Year” honors!!  I couldn’t be out here without her. Time to turn in and get ready for a day filled with running errands tomorrow. Also supposed to be a rainy day.  Good to be here and making my way across New York. Goodnight Sweetheart.","William Brien Memorial Shelter

Spent the night in Fort Montgomery NY and was able to pick up the resupply box Marlene sent and get thru the planning for the next few days. It was such a relief to open that box and find everything I needed (and a few extras). Have my new dri bag for food to replace the one shredded by the bear. Also some new food ideas that Marlene sent for me to try. So good to have her looking out for me. The next few days are hard to plan specifically until I find out if my daily miles can increase as I get off the meds, or at least one of them.  Was also able to repair some clothing and gear today. Going out tomorrow morning to cross the Hudson first thing, followed by an iconic big climb on the other side.  Will see how it goes.   Thanks to all who are following along and praying for my strength and safety. And thank you most to my sweet wife. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Fort Montgomery NY

Felt stronger today. I am thru taking both meds, though Marlene says they will still have an effect for several more days.  Breakfast down the street and back to unpack and repack, trying to improve how things were riding in the pack. Marlene sent a lot of food and I am carrying it all since I am still finding my way with the distance I can travel in a day and how convenient the resupply stores are without being able to hitchhike.   Hobbit and I were ready to leave right at 7:30 and the motel owner was on time.  We unloaded at the south end of the Bear Mountain Bridge at the toll booth. I got a video there, half way across, and then on the north end, showing the bridge, river, and Hudson valley. A big climb started right at the north end of the bridge. It went well and I expected there would be one more view point from above where I could get a panorama of the bridge et al again but no such viewpoint on the trail from above. I sent Marlene what I had and headed north in earnest. The hike went well and much of it was easier terrain with the occasional rocky sections.  All day I was hearing what sounded like artillery fire. I am familiar with that sound both from Camp Pendleton and my time in Vietnam. I would hear the shell impacts and sometimes if I listened just right I could hear the report of the guns when they fired. West Point is just up the river from my crossing point so I expect cadets were learning to fire the big guns today.  By lunch time I was at the place where the trail crosses US 9 and NY 403 where the Appalachian Market serves deli sandwiches etc. so I sat with Green Grass, Sunshine, Dine N Dash, and a few others to have a burger and Gatorade. Less than a mile ahead is the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center where they allow hikers to tent in the ball field area. I opted to keep going past there since it would have meant quitting very early. I am camped alone in a remote spot in the woods, set up and ready for the night. I do not expect anyone to show up at this remote and somewhat hard to find location.  I felt better today and look forward to tomorrow to see if I can begin to expect continued improvement. Moving along in New York. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Bear Mountain Bridge

Got up and away early from my remote campsite. It was the quietest place in the woods I have ever spent a night. No sounds from civilization and even the birds were silent.  The tiniest piece of a leaf fell from overhead and I was able to hear it hit the tent fabric. Slept pretty well at least for me.  I ran into Turtle, New Girl, Kidska, Caleb, Sunshine,  Dine N Dash and several others throughout the day, but mostly hiked alone as I prefer.  Stopped and called Marlene hoping to catch her driving to work - did - so we got to talk for a few minutes, always so nice.  It was great hiking weather mostly. The terrain had few large climbs, but many climbs of a few hundred feet and very rocky, rough terrain.  A storm earlier this year took down hundreds of trees. The trail maintainers are all volunteers and they have done a great job cutting passage ways for the trail thru the debris.  There is still much to do and especially north of here and in Connecticut. Today was my longest day so far and my feet know it.  Stiff joints and aching back so I am developing my “hiker hobble” like the others.   Need to finalize setup for the night. I am in the Clarence Fahnestock State Park where hikers can tent for free one night. No water available at the concession stand (not yet open) but the ranger came by and took all my bottles to the office to fill - so nice - so helpful for me. Need a good rest.

Packed up at the State Park and was off with little fanfare. I felt tired and a little sickly and felt some discomfort in my knees. Usually I get over it pretty quickly and into my stride. But today I felt sluggish with low energy. I decided to go just 5 miles ahead to the next shelter and take the rest of the day to regroup. This seems to have worked as I feel much better after getting some extra sleep. 
The major climb was Shenandoah Mountain where there is an American flag painted on the flat stone surface at the summit. The flag is a 911 Memorial Flag and dedicated in memory of that awful day. I got a video and sent it to Marlene. There have been thousands of trees blown over in this area and both south and north of here in a storm a few weeks ago. In places the trees are stacked atop one another.  Much work has been done and still remains to clear the trail. Many places look like a wood lot. Today I met one of the members of the chainsaw gangs and thanked him for all the volunteer work they do to clear the trail.  I am at the RPH shelter for the night and will give it a try again in the morning.   Goodnight Sweetheart.","Clarence Fahnestock State Park

At RPH Shelter last evening we were pretty much all asleep inside the shelter (my first time not in my tent) and the police showed up with a drunk and possibly homeless person and basically dumped him at the shelter.  He came thru the shelter with a light shining everyone to see if there was room. By just about every measure you could use this was a very unsavory character, and especially made the young women uncomfortable.   He was loud and disruptive most of the night. This morning I got up early and so did he, and he tried to engage me in a loud conversation which I refused to do. He was very unhappy about that but people were trying to sleep.  Glad to be rid of him. Some of the hikers reported this to the ATC. I hope the police are contacted to stop using the shelter to dump problem folks.
Later I thought about that incident as I walked along and it hit me that the New Testament says we should love people like that. I wondered how I could.  Then I thought about everything about that man that I disliked and realized that I must have been that guy to Jesus, except 1000 or so times more since he is perfect and he still loved me. After that when I compare myself to the drunk, it’s just two bad guys arguing about who’s worse. 
Today went well. I hiked to the next shelter and will do the same tomorrow to position myself to resupply in one of the next towns.  There was a 1000 foot climb right away this morning and one or two more a little smaller. It was hotter today than the last few days, which still seems to drain my energy. I was happy to pass the 100 mile mark for this trip. Always good to log a milestone and so encouraging. I was running low on water at Stormville Road and asked a contractor at a home site if there was a spigot. He said the well is new and not yet drinkable. I told him no problem and I’d get some water ahead and God would provide. A couple of tenths of a mile ahead as I was at an intersection to find a road to take me over the I-84 interstate a young man pulls up in a pickup, opens his window and makes a sign as if tipping up a bottle. He asked if I needed water and handed me a cold 2 liter bottle - just what I needed for having lunch. Many streams today were dry but God provided when I needed it. See the picture of the street sign post in the photos section and it’s description for the more complete story.  (Tap picture to see the description text). I got to the Morgan Stewart Shelter after one last big climb and am set up for the night. I have a video and a couple of pictures for today but am very low on battery to last until day after tomorrow. Must conserve. Goodnight Sweetheart.","RPH Shelter

Quiet early morning wake up at the shelter. All the shelter dwellers and the other tenters were sleeping in so I had a nice quiet time to break down my tent, pack up and have breakfast listening to the birds and morning sounds in the forest. Not a particularly difficult day, with some challenges due to hot weather. Some rocky climbs but many nice woods walks and even a few open fields. I came to Nuclear Lake, which I believe is a glacial Lake. Very pretty and remote.  Kind of a big rocky climb up West Mountain where my original destination was the Telephone Pioneers Shelter. There I met several day hikers on weekend outings, riding the commuter train from NYC.  Also met a local hiker named Suzanne (and her dog) who asked about my journal - she has already signed the guestbook. Two brothers from NYC were there and brought out a small wrapped apple pie to celebrate my birthday.   My phone battery was essentially dead and I was planning to go into town tomorrow for resupply so I decided to hike a few extra miles and come in today so I could recharge and also clean up. The Appalachian Trail RR Station crosses the trail and then the trail comes onto the highway with the Native Landscapes and Garden Center nearby. They are very hiker friendly. I got something to drink and was able to contact a motel and get a ride lined up. Planning my resupply and enjoyed real food and a chance to clean up. Was able to recharge my phone and called Marlene to catch up. I think she was starting to wonder with no word from me. Today was my birthday so my phone and Facebook lit up with well-wishes. Thanks to all!  It is so encouraging to find out you are following along. Will finalize plans for next few days. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Morgan Stewart Shelter

He would not even let me give him gas money.  My laundry is done and I got a couple of showers, and was able to rest. Got my phone backed up using the deli wi-fi, so all chores done. Marlene sent me the link so I was able to attend church on my phone via Livestream this morning. Very special.

Big day.  Up and ready, quickly out to breakfast at Ben’s Deli, where Bill showed up at 7 as agreed, right after dropping his child with the school bus. At the trailhead in a few minutes and on my way.  The rest did me a lot of good as I felt strong carrying the heavy resupplied pack. Open fields and pastures for awhile, then a big climb. I had it on auto pilot and moved along at a comfortable pace thru beautiful woods. About 7 miles in I crossed into Connecticut. Later back into NY and still later back into CT. I always love doing that and marking milestones. My original plan was to hike to Ten Mile River Shelter, coincidently about 10 miles for the day. It was early and I was doing well so I did not even stop there, planning to find a spot later or go to Schaghticoke Mountain Campsite (scat-a-coke), a long day that would end with a big big climb. The Ten Mile River area is beautiful with many views of the river, bridges, and mountain scenery. The climb up the mountain was over 1000 feet and looked very difficult so I decided to at least knock the climb out today. It was indeed one of my most difficult climbs, especially at the end of the day. When I reached the top I decided to go for it since it was 2 more miles and the path seemed flat. The first mile was nice and the second mile was very technical and tough. I finally got to camp on a steep side trail with just enough time to set up, eat, and get in my tent before darkness fell over the woods. I am here with Bat Girl and Sally Forth, two young women, and Shelter Dog, a young man.  We had good conversation as we got ready for this day to end. Cell service has been poor since right at the border. I will try to contact Marlene when I climb up out of this hollow where the campsites sit between two massive stone ridges, all strung out in a long line.  It was a long hard day. I am happy with making more miles, but will see how my body responds tomorrow. Goodnight Sweetheart.","NY 22 - Appalachian Trail RR Station

Difficult day. I somehow thought that since I was on top of Schaghticoke Mountain I would start the day coming down in a relatively easy descent. Wow!  Was that ever wrong. From space I am imagining this mountain to be star shaped or X shaped. It must have 3 dozen summits with huge canyons and ravines between. Most of this is piles of boulders and high rocks to step up or down. Often a mountain or ridge is hiked along the summit in one compass direction generally. This mountain  went in all directions and seemingly around in circles. This was followed by a series of regular mountains but with the same rough terrain up and down, mostly with beautiful views to the valleys. Finally I climbed St. John’s Ledges and Caleb’s Peak. The descent is legendary. It comes down a nearly vertical face about 600 feet with hundreds if not thousands of rock “steps” in a treacherous descent. Every step had to be studied. I am so glad it was not raining. The descent takes you down to the Housatonic River. Then a mile walking on a flat gravel road and another mile on nice flat regular trail beside this beautiful river. I had lunch way up on the mountain with three guys and left first.  I arrived at this campsite two hours before they did, as the descent took a long time for them as each had to negotiate the next obstacle before they moved on.  They asked if I had concerns about doing it alone. I was fine but made myself be careful. This morning my plan was to get to this campsite and decide about hiking a little further. My tank was empty and I have never been more happy to get to camp. I pushed myself a little yesterday and that plus today’s difficult terrain wore me out. I am in my tent and ready to rest.  Not sure of plans for tomorrow. May depend on how I sleep. Cell coverage continues to be weak. May try to text Marlene as we have had little contact today. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Schaghticoke Mountain Campsite

Rainy day. Most of the terrain was the same as CT has been since I crossed the border. Started out with a nice easy walk beside the Housatonic River. Then the usual climbs and descents over a rocky and boulder-y mountain trail. Rain makes rocks slippery so I had to be extra careful. Would not have wanted to come down the massive rocky steps of yesterday in today’s rain. Planned a 10 mile day with the option to hike about 2.5 more but there was a break in the rain so I stopped and got set up. Sprinkling now. Some may remember The Lemon Squeezer from a couple of weeks ago. I sent Marlene a video of that and she posted it on Facebook. Today I passed thru what the guidebook says to “Pass thru cracked boulder similar to Lemon Squeezer”.  Apparently this one does not have its own name. I have a video to send Marlene but very weak or nonexistent signal so will send it when I can.   Not sure if I can post this journal entry until tomorrow either. Marlene and I are trying to get a resupply box organized for me to receive in Great Barrington, MA so I hope we can communicate to finalize that.

Unusual Day. Got out by 7 from the shelter and made good time on mostly nice woods trail with a few boulders thrown in to keep my attention. Around 9 (eastern) I called Marlene so we could finalize the resupply box she is sending to Great Barrington. In that conversation I realized how fortunate I am to have her to help me. She really goes out of her way to understand what I need and how important the details are so things can go smoothly out here. It would be very tough without her. Thanks Sweetheart!!  
After that I came to an opening in the trees from the ridge called Hang Glider view. I got a video of the beautiful valley below to send to Marlene. At the time I was unaware of what I was seeing but there was an oval track that at first I thought they were using to race motorcycles, but later realized it was sporty race cars. Too late for the video comments to mention that it was cars. I watched the action for awhile from my perch on the ridge, maybe a mile away. 
I need about two days resupply to make it to pick up the box Marlene is sending so I planned to make a lunch and quick resupply stop in Falls Village CT. I met Muzzy from Melbourne, Australia and we walked into town together. We had lunch at the Toymakers Cafe, but found out there is absolutely no grocery store of any kind in town. You couldn’t even buy a Slim Jim or a granola bar in the whole town. So after a huge hot dog, Pepsi, and a fruit smoothie I made plans to hike ahead tomorrow and make a side trip to Salisbury CT to get supplies for 2-3 days. Muzzy was completely out so he planned to try to do the same by hiking there today and overnight in town. Too much distance for me at this point. 
In the area around Falls Village there was a lot of road walking, and using road bridges to cross the Housatonic River. I also walked beside the river today for a significant distance. My destination became Limestone Spring Shelter. Turns out it is 1/2 mile off the trail and down in a very steep ravine. So steep that the climb out of here tomorrow will be one of the biggest climbs of the day. I would not have come down here but it is the only available water source for a good distance and I was end of day low. Just have to do it. So I continue to move across Connecticut. Making steady progress though my daily miles continue to be a challenge. Goodnight Sweetheart, and thanks for being my trail boss.","Pine Swamp Brook Shelter

Pretty good day. Started out at Limestone Springs Shelter, a beautiful shelter site but a terrible location. It is a half mile off the trail with the last 3/10 scaling down a precipitous cliff.  Climbed out of there first thing - you just have to do it. Since I could not resupply in Falls Village yesterday I had to go into Salisbury CT to buy food and also had lunch while there. Had to walk in but got a ride back out. Worked out great. Climbed to Lions Head and got a video of the beautiful sweeping valley but I had my screen too dark and could not see the video screen clearly enough and forgot to zoom back out so may have ruined the last half by being in too close. Lesson learned. Passed the Riga Shelter and went to Brassie Brook Shelter instead. A shorter day but good with resupply chores done. I am here with Rabbit, Oven, Honey Bun, Mr Peanutbutter and a few others I have not met. It seems cold tonite so I hope to sleep well.

Kind of a tough day for me.  Did not sleep much last night and could feel it when I got out this morning. First thing was a steep rocky climb to Bear Mountain where I got a video of the broad Housatonic Valley. That climb went well enough but I could tell the heat was coming later. Down from Bear Mountain to Sages Ravine, a beautiful swath thru the mountain filled with huge boulders, a picturesque stream tumbling down, and stately old trees. I have known of Sages Ravine from childhood but cannot remember if I learned of it from a book, American history, or possibly from American Literature when we studied something like the Thoreau era.  An idyllic setting.  About half way thru I came to the CT/MA border- so nice to have Connecticut completed. Then began a long grinding climb up Race Mountain, with more great views to the same valley. The climb, the long summit, and the descent were a treacherous boulder filled path the whole way. It continued to get hotter and the work became increasingly tough.  Finally down from Race Mountain and right away the climb up Mount Everett begins - the hardest of all. A straight up climb with about a dozen sections having wooden steps made of thick wood blocks bolted to the surface of the rock slabs to provide footholds. By this time I was low on water as several streams in the section were dry. Finally to the summit and carefully down to get to this shelter site, a beautiful camping area in a forest of very large hemlock trees.  I filtered water and ate, plus a quick bird bath down by the creek. There are about a dozen here, great folks. I am hearing owls off in the woods and other twilight sounds.

Up early for a shower one last time before I get back to the funk. Breakfast at the motel then final packing and recheck of everything.  Joe Sokul the shuttle driver was on time at 7 and we were on our way. Started with more fields and pastures and another crossing of the Housatonic River. Quick climb up June Mountain followed right away by East Mountain. I heard a loud crack and recognized the sound of a huge branch falling from a large tree about 75 feet away. The forest is littered with such debris but you rarely see and hear them fall. I was the only one around to witness it, but it answered a question for me. “If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?”  I think it does. The entire forest seemed to pause momentarily to note the event, then went on. It was a funny experience. 
From the top I could see the valley I had been videoing the last few days from the other side. The view was obscured by trees and not suitable for making a video, but I could see Bear Mountain, Race Mountain, Mount Everett, and Jug End, now on the opposite side of the valley, all strung out in a row for miles. The Housatonic Valley is over 10 miles wide here - so great to see it from this ridge with the other mountains as the backdrop. Pulled in to the Tom Leonard Shelter to filter water - a long way downhill to the source and then back up. Decided to have lunch there.  Talked with Marlene and she sent me some info to help me decide to skip the Mount Wilcox South Shelter and come here to the Mount Wilcox North Shelter- a great choice with good tent sites and reliable water source.  I am down for the night as darkness begins to set in.  There is a group here in training for some kind of outdoor guide outfit and they are talking quietly over in their tent area. I hear a few bird sounds but otherwise a still evening. No one has phone service so I will have to post and contact Marlene once I am back on the main ridge tomorrow.

Long day today for me.  Miles of woods walks and plenty of climbs and rocky descents, including Beartown Mountain, Cobble Hill, and Baldy Mountain. After Cobble Hill I came to Jerusalem Road where some kids had a “trail stand” where I got a coke and other snacks, plus was able get water at their spring - Running Spring Farm. I think I wore myself out today right from the start by determining that I wanted to make it to Upper Goose Pond Cabin for the night - a kind of special place along the trail that is sort of “must see”. The whole day I was watching the miles and my progress and it became kind of a burden with my pushing forward continuously all day. I’m glad I got here but I was virtually exhausted.  It probably affected my ability to enjoy the evening. There is a good group here and I will be in a bunk for the night. I must hold on to the discipline I need to do what I can and be satisfied. I need to decide what will be best for tomorrow. Too tired to think about it tonite and there is no phone service here.

Woke up still feeling worn out from yesterday. At Upper Goose Pond Cabin the Caretaker Joanne provides coffee and pancakes (blueberry today) to all the hikers. There were probably 20 of us this morning. The coffee was great and the pancakes were home made and went away as fast as she could make them.  Hikers began to leave and I was considering what to do. I could have taken a zero day there. I called Marlene and we talked about it. She is good with me taking the time I need but I was unsettled. I finally decided to hike ahead a couple of miles and go in to Lee, MA and buy enough food to get me to Dalton, MA and then forward the box at the Lee post office ahead to Dalton. If you don’t open the box it will be forwarded for no additional charge. About half way to Lee I became very hungry for some reason and stopped to have essentially lunch, after a late start for the day just before 10.  When I got to the road a retired man named Dave pulled over right away - the first vehicle to go by - and dropped me at the Big Y grocery store where I got resupplied and had a great deli sandwich and a coke.  My return ride was difficult as I stood by the road for 45 minutes. Finally I crossed the road to where some construction workers were working on equipment and asked the foreman about a ride. He had one of the men take me back to the trail in a company truck. More of the same Massachusetts terrain, and I am camped alone in the woods just past Finerty Pond, another beautiful glacial pond in the forest. So I am satisfied with how today went with shorter progress but at least some, and I feel better. I need a good rest tonite. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Upper Goose Pond Cabin

The woods were very quiet overnite.  I broke camp alone at my stealth campsite hearing the occasional bird but mostly the quietest tick as small seeds from the trees fell and hit last falls brown leaves. I had heard them hitting my tent during the night. The terrain today was generally more flat than usual with a few climbs mixed in. I stopped at October Mountain Shelter for a morning break and talked to an 11 year old girl and her mom, who are from Alaska. The 11 year old wanted to walk across a state and they chose Massachusetts. A good conversation with them. I had lunch at a makeshift parking lot where the AT crosses Blotz Road, sitting on a large rock. A group of older hikers came out of the woods southbound, having completed a morning hike. Some sort of senior citizen outdoor activity group. They had many questions for me and gave me some water since they were at the end of their trip. One couple were from Australia. I continued on to the Kay Wood Shelter where I am with the ridge runner (trail volunteer/employee who travels a section of trail during the season) and a young woman from Scotland.  Very poor to non-existent phone service here.  I was alone when I arrived and went straight to the water source in the ravine below to filter water and soak my feet in the cold stream.  We are talking quietly as we prepare to eat. Tomorrow I go to Dalton to resupply and possibly take a zero day. Then planning for the rest of Massachusetts.  Evening is coming on, the best time of the day sometimes.

Away from the Kay Wood Shelter early for a quick 3 Miles into Dalton MA to pick up my box at the post office. Retrieved the food and one shirt and sent the cold weather gear ahead to Bennington VT, my next resupply point. Got a room at the Shamrock Inn and met other hikers. We quickly arranged with Tom Levardi, a local trail angel, for a ride to the grocery. That handled, I did laundry and did planning and other chores including a stop at the town library to use the computer. Tom Levardi and I were talking and he offered to drive me 10 miles north on the trail to a road crossing so I could hike back to town with a light pack of basic necessities, and Glider, overhearing the conversation, decided to do the same on Monday morning. Then Tom will drive us to the same point Tuesday morning and we will continue north, with Mount Greylock, highest peak in MA, right in front of us.  Went for supper with Glider and am down for the night.  Talked with Marlene so that was a good time.

Lazy Sunday morning in Dalton MA. Got on church website and caught up on last Sunday’s message and then tuned in to Live Stream for today’s service, live on my phone.  Was great to see friends and participate in the morning worship service from Massachusetts. Pastor Rick was tipped off that I was watching and gave me a shout out. That was fun, and much appreciated. The rest of the day was rest and getting ready. Talked with Marlene several times so we could catch up. A good day. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Dalton Massachusetts

Right on time Tom Levardi was there to pick up Glider and me for the shuttle to the trail. It had rained Sunday afternoon and several times overnight so the woods were dripping wet.  There was a nice cool breeze and by about 10:00 the sky began to clear. Glider and I mostly hiked together and made good time hiking back to town with our light packs.  So my progress of about 10 miles today puts me right at the foot of Mount Greylock, highest peak in MA.  We have set our tents up in Tom’s backyard for tonight. Then Tom will take us to the same road crossing tomorrow morning and we will continue north.   I am planning to be in Bennington VT around Thursday night or Friday morning. That will be a good milestone to make.  Need to plan for supper and get everything packed and ready. Then a little while to relax.  Goodnight Sweetheart.","Dalton Massachusetts

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595477,"I was tenting in the backyard at Tom Levardi’s house in Dalton, Massachusetts. Up at 5:30 to start the day. There were about 8 hikers tenting around the yard.  The dew was heavy and our tents were wet as if it had rained overnight. Sunrise did not dry us out so we mostly packed up wet. After breakfast from our food bags,  supplemented by Tom with coffee and pastries, we were off to the trailhead. Glider and I got dropped off 7 miles south of the Greylock summit and began our big climb right away. The climb was steep, and very rocky in many places, but we felt good about making it to the summit right around noon. The day was clear and temperatures were under 70 most of the way, but the path was a green tunnel with no views to the outside world the whole way.  We were worn out when we got there but were able to rest and refresh with drinks and I had a hot dog in the Bascom Lodge  diner. There is a large tower shaped much like a lighthouse at the summit, which I climbed. You can see probably over 50 miles to the horizon, especially on a clear day like today. Also you can see 5 states from there - Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire.  We had very poor phone service which surprised us. We loaded up to leave, thinking we had an easy 3+ miles downhill to the shelter. Those were the longest 3 miles ever. Steep and rocky (like Pennsylvania rocks) trail and significant ups and downs the whole way. Our progress was way below expectations, making it seem to take forever to get to the Wilbur Clearing Shelter.  We are here and set for the night. I am happy to have completed Mount Greylock and also to be nearing the Vermont border. Much to report on today and plans for tomorrow but almost no phone service all day. I did get a message out to Marlene so she is aware that I have made it over Greylock and am safely at the shelter. There is still much to do to get off of this mountain.  Hope to sleep well tonite.

Great night’s sleep, best since I started.  After yesterday I needed it. I woke at 5:00 and no one else was stirring so I quietly got ready and left to climb Prospect Mountain where I found good phone reception. I sent yesterday’s photos and videos and some from Mount Prospect this morning and Marlene and I traded text messages. I spent an hour at Mount Prospect enjoying the beautiful view.  Then down to North Adams where I crossed the Hoosic River on a footbridge and began the trek to the Seth Warner Shelter.  About 4 miles into that section I came to the Vermont-Massachusetts border.  I got pictures but was unable to send them to Marlene.  Always so happy to cross into another state, and so is she. Rain threatened the whole afternoon but we made it over a fairly nice trail with some extreme rocky sections mixed in. One was so extreme that there was a bypass trail - we didn’t take it.  Glider and I are here and there is an older couple here for a short trip on the Long Trail.  There are 150 miles of the Appalachian Trail in Vermont. There is a trail called the Long Trail that starts at the Vermont/Massachusetts border and goes generally North thru Vermont to the Canadian border.  The AT and the Long Trail share the same path for about 105 miles going north. Then the AT turns east toward New Hampshire for about 50 miles to the VT/NH border. The Long Trail is older than the Appalachian Trail.  So it is a rainy evening here at the shelter and we will likely turn in early since there is little else to do.  I plan to go to Bennington VT tomorrow for resupply.

Rainy day.  Rained all night at the shelter too but I had stayed inside so no wet tent.   Packed up and was gone early. The trail was a flowing stream with generous servings of the famous Vermont mud (Vermud) and a rocky way almost like Pennsylvania.  I slugged it out all morning to the Congdon Shelter where I met Wisecracker, my first SOBO (southbound hiker starting in Maine and going to Georgia).   We talked as we ate and as I was ready to leave Glider came in for lunch. We planned to meet at the Summit of Harmon Hill where cell phone service was available to call the motel shuttle in Bennington.  Another long wet hike ahead to there and when Glider showed up we made arrangements. Then the monsoon really hit. We had a short hike in regular Vermont woods but ahead lay one of the most difficult descents down a steep cliff-like trail to the road. This was treacherous as we came down in that rain. Rocks were slippery and the rain and humidity made my glasses cloud over. Blind man coming down the cliff. It took a long time with many slips and slides but we got safely down. Whew!  The hotel shuttle picked us up and we got right to laundry, resupply and eating.   The plan is to finalize things in the morning and head back to the trail for the hike to Manchester Center, VT, my next resupply stop.  Marlene is sending my new shoes there.

Glider and I were up and ready to get breakfast and then be at the Post Office in Bennington when they opened at 8.  I forwarded my bounce box ahead to Manchester Center and also sent my stove ahead to save that weight since my resupply included no food that required cooking or boiling water - save every ounce I can when climbing these big mountains.  The shuttle dropped us off at 9 and immediately we had a climb of 1300 feet. The day was warmer but we had a green tunnel with shade most of the way.  Lots of big climbs and rocky trail with many steep sections with large rocks fitted into the mountainside as steps.  We are at the Goddard Shelter about 3/4 of the way up Glastenbury Mountain, which has a fire tower on top to see tomorrow morning.  There are big mountains ahead including Stratton Mountain, Bromley Mountain and Peru Peak, with smaller ones between. No rain today and the trail was well drained with the normal mud pits of Vermont. Temperatures were in the 80’s but the forecast for record temps in the high 90’s the next few days has been moderated a little. Cooler is better. We have a full shelter tonight and a good group is here. We are settling in as the birds are having a bird calling competition.  No pictures or videos today.

Goddard Shelter is a few tenths of a mile below the summit of Glastenbury Mountain so I was up early and ready to hike up to the summit to climb the fire tower there. Cool and breezy with a good 360 degree view. I got pics and videos and sent them to Marlene.  Pretty tall tower so they could see over the tall pine trees there.  Hiked ahead and passed the Kid Gore Shelter mid morning and then on to see a beautiful beaver pond in the remote woods just before the climb to Story Spring Shelter where I had lunch.  Glider came in while I was there so we made plans to camp at the campsite by Stratton-Arlington Road at mile 1634.3, right at the base of the huge Stratton Mountain. That will be our first 3.5 miles to hike to the summit in the morning.  Then about 2 miles ahead from lunch - Trail Magic!!  Fresh Ground, a kind of famous roving trail magic provider, was set up off a gravel road we crossed in the woods.  He had a grill for hot dogs with all the fixins, grilled cheese sandwiches, various snacks and chips, and lots of fruit. My favorite was fresh sliced watermelon - cool and sweet. We had just eaten lunch but you’d never know it as Fresh Ground pushes the all you can eat mindset. It was great and I was in a food induced coma.  I powered ahead to the campsite. There are many tents here as hikers opted to do the big climb on fresh legs in the morning. We’ll see how that goes.  It is 7:30 pm and someone came in to say more trail magic about 100 yards below our campsite in the gravel parking lot by the stream. So we went down for a late snack - pizza, watermelon, soft drinks and fruit drinks, snacks and candy. What a day. Hope I sleep well.  Have had no service, but got one bar down at the parking lot but not sure if the text message to Marlene was sent. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Goddard Shelter

Up early for the climb to the summit of Stratton Mountain as planned. Hiked alone the whole way. A hard climb; I kept expecting to see the tower as I rounded turn after turn only to see more trail climbing ever further.  Finally there.   The 360 degree views are really beautiful. I was completely soaked from 92 degree heat and high humidity.  Climbed the tower for videos and enjoyed the view and especially drying off in the high winds at the top.  About 4 miles ahead is Stratton Pond, another beautiful and remote glacial lake. Vermont has many flowing streams of all sizes with rock hopping crossings and some footbridges. There are also lots of mud pits - low areas where the trail is a stream bed and full of mud edge to edge and beyond. Feet wet and muddy most of the time. My legs get splattered with mud and I splash off when I can. There are also very few actual roads to cross, though there are remote logging roads that are overgrown. Very seldom do I have phone service, even from high ridges.  We got to the William B. Douglas Shelter but it sits a half mile off the trail with that same half mile to climb back up to the trail in the morning. My heart wasn’t in it but we decided to hike ahead 3 miles instead to the Spruce Peak Shelter for the night. The heat of the day was stifling but I am glad we are here and set for a shorter hike into town for resupply - Manchester Center , VT. It is late and time for sleep. I am in my tent and watching the day end as the darkness in the forest creeps ever closer.  Everyone is quiet. Not even animal sounds. So peaceful.  Marlene and I caught up by phone as I have service here above the city on this ridge. It was great to catch up and send her all my photos and videos. Time to rest.

So I was ready to get to town after days of heat and humidity.  I was up and away by 6:30 for a cool-er morning in the woods. Still dripping wet with sweat by 7:00.  Fairly easy trip with one climb that seemed to grow as I did it - the way they all do.  When I got to the road I saw two young female hikers standing by the road on the other side with their thumbs out. They had spent the night in the woods over there to wait for morning, stashed their packs in the woods, and were hitching in for a quick resupply.  I’m a little leary about having my pack out of my sight but to each his own I guess. I told them I’d wait until they got a ride since sometimes it’s harder with three people but they told me to join them and we got a ride a couple of minutes later. There is a rumor that hitchhiking goes better when there is at least one female, so I’m not taking credit for the quick ride we got.  Five and a half miles later we were dropped off in Manchester Center Vermont where I went to work getting the new shoes Marlene sent at the post office, resupplied at the Price Chopper grocery and then went to Macdonald’s for a quick lunch. I called Jeff at the Green Mountain Hostel and he was there in 10 minutes to pick me up.  This place is like a 5 star hostel. Very clean and organized. I quickly showered, did laundry and lay down to rest.  Laying on a real mattress is like the sensation I had the other day when I came to Fresh Ground’s Trail Magic in the woods in the 90+ heat and humidity and he handed me a cold slice of fresh watermelon.   I was resting right away.  Arrangements have been made to hike a short day tomorrow with a light pack, good for breaking in my new shoes. Then on Wednesday I will carry a light pack again for a more normal distance and then back to this hostel for one more night. That seems like a good compromise in that I will not get a zero miles day, but will still make progress while getting some rest.  I’m good with that. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Spruce Peak Shelter

Was up early this morning to make breakfast down in the hostel kitchen with the supplies they provide - boiled 3 eggs, English muffin toasted, banana, and Kuerig coffee.  I had a light pack ready with drinks and snacks for the morning walk, plus a few gear items just in case. Don’t Care, Glider and I were shuttled out to Mad Tom Notch - US Forest Service Road 21 (gravel). Our first assignment was a 1000 foot climb up to Bromley Mountain summit and the ski lift area there. A nice climb with a light pack - very comfortable and in no hurry.  The summit area was so beautiful with a 360 degree view and an open clearing there so we could see out to mountains and ridge lines in all directions. We could also see back to Stratton Mountain and the ski slope on its’ flank.  I got pictures and videos and sent them to Marlene via so-so phone coverage - surprising that the coverage was that weak up there - but that’s Vermont   After a nice rest and cool down time with the breeze drying my clothes, I continued down one of the slope runs and then back into the woods, downhill for most of the way to the road. A very relaxing and fun walk since I was in no hurry to make big miles today.   I waited for Glider at the road so we could hitch a ride. Don’t Care had another few miles to walk as he had come off the trail the other day at a different point.  A nice lady picked us up after about 10 minutes and she brought us to the outfitter in Manchester Center where I bought a set of gators to help prevent mud and debris from getting into my new shoes.  This short day was great for breaking in my new shoes. My feet feel great with the protection of new soles.   After a sandwich at a restaurant we called for a ride back to the hostel. I have showered already and am about to work on plans for the next few days. So I am getting some rest while making a little progress too. Happy with that. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Spruce Peak Shelter

We were up early and out to Mad Tom Knotch, USFS 21, a gravel road at the bottom of Styles Peak, a 1000 foot climb to start the day. Don’t Care, Glider and I hiked it mostly together with our light packs giving us a nice enjoyable climb. Styles Peak is basically a twin with Peru Peak so we had a double climb but it went well. Very little scenery since the forest was close in on all sides.   The day grew hot again with the record heat wave and humidity.  The climb to Baker Peak was a surprise as the approach to the top was long angular slabs of stone slanted up to the summit. Funny, but it seemed almost like a nice change of pace.  I was able to get a nice view and a video and photo of the huge mountains around and the valley below. Rounding out the day was the beautiful glacial Lost Pond, true to its’ name, and a very remote river sized stream called Big Branch, which tumbles over a wide bed littered with gigantic boulders. We stood on a suspended footbridge and watched the water tumble below.  I made it to the road, a remote wilderness road, and the others soon followed.  We were picked up by Duffy from the hostel and came back to shower and get organized for the move north tomorrow.   Weather forecast continues the heat and humidity with the predicted return to more normal temps always moving out a day or two. I am satisfied with my stay here at the Green Mountain Hiker Hostel.  It is one of the absolute best.  Also, though I did not get any actual full days off, I got lots of rest and still made over 18 miles progress northward.   Tomorrow I will continue across Vermont.

Another sweltering day.   We were ready to head out to the trail from Green Mountain Hiker Hostel for the last time at 6:30 this morning.  Sad for our stay at this deluxe place to end.  Our first few miles were a gradual climb beside a pretty mountain stream in the cool morning air.  Then another remote pond - Little Rock Pond - a glacial jewel in the forest.  We climbed to a peak that seems to have no name and descended to Bully Brook for lunch beside a nice stream with a rocky streambed and then the water tumbling down over ledges as the stream gave way below us as we began to climb yet another Bear Mountain.  All the Bear Mountains have been a real BEAR and this one was no exception. 1100 feet that started gradually and then became more steep and rocky the higher we went.   Glider and I separated to allow each his own pace. The route up was never ending.  The heat was oppressive.  I was completely dripping wet.  Then the long descent to the shelter area - easier, but by now a pounding punishment for my tired feet.   Glider arrived 10 minutes before me and when I saw him I knew we both were done for the day.   We had toyed last night with hiking 5 miles ahead today but there was nothing left in us to make that happen.  Still satisfied with today’s progress. Very tired. It took an hour but I was able to get one short message to Marlene - very weak service again.  I’m in my tent just before dark listening to birds calling to each other from around the forest, quietly.  It’s nearly dark but still in the 80’s so slow to cool down for sleeping.

How things change.  At 4:00 this morning I heard a distant rumble that turned out to be not so distant. The downpour was quickly upon me. Funny though, it was cozy and I was dry in my tent so the rain was kind of fun. I lay there and enjoyed the fury while I drifted back to sleep. By time to get going the rain was slowing and when I was thru with what I could do inside my tent it had stopped.  I got packed and moved to the shelter. When I had retrieved my bear bag the rain returned. After breakfast Glider had gotten up and we decided to wait a little before leaving. The rain slowed and stopped as we started out. It was a nice cool morning.  Normal climbs and descents to start the day. I came to an overlook above the Rutland Vermont airport and shot a video. A few miles later we came to the Clarendon Gorge with a pretty suspension bridge swaying above the stream and I got another video.   Then a climb up Beacon Hill and down to Gould Brook for lunch and filtering water.  Then the hard stuff.  But first, a couple of miles ahead I came to the famous “Katahdin 500 Miles” sign where I had to get the iconic picture. That was fun.  Then the climb to Killington Peak began.  One of the most difficult and never-ending climbs I’ve done. Rugged steep trail with no end in sight at the end of the day. Finally here to find a dilapidated shelter made of stone with naked openings with no windows and sleeping platforms sagging and tilted at an uncomfortable angle.

I was at the Yellow Deli Hiker Hostel in Rutland VT where they have a very neat, clean and organized hostel. They are located in downtown and close to Walmart, Price Chopper Grocery, and restaurants. All my chores were finished  including a big heavy resupply. Breakfast is included in the donation-based deal so we had a rice and egg dish that was tasty, plus coffee, toast and several kinds of fruit.  Then we retrieved our packs and hurried out the back to the bus station where we caught a $2.00 ride back to the trailhead on US 4.  One mile ahead after a pretty hefty climb I came to Maine Junction.  When the Appalachian Trail enters Vermont from Massachusetts it shares the path with the Long Trail for 105 miles heading mostly straight north.  At Maine Junction the Long Trail continues north to the Canadian border and the Appalachian Trail turns hard east heading for New Hampshire, about 45 miles ahead.  All the Long Trail hikers will be leaving us as they continue north.  So I feel like another milestone is reached in my trek across Vermont.  Ahead I passed Kent Pond, another remote glacial pond in the woods surrounded by mountains, and then on to Thundering Falls, a waterfall seemingly popular with local folks and more tame than I expected it to be.   Then the climb to Quimby Mountain, pretty steep and challenging, including the descent.  I am at the Stony Brook Shelter for the night. Typical of Vermont there is no phone service. I am happy with the progress and miles I am accumulating toward getting to New Hampshire.  Much to plan for there but also good to finally be approaching the really big mountains of New England.  I spent Sunday morning thinking about Marlene and her morning as I followed her thru the church schedule for the day.  Gave me a sense of closeness across the miles and the separation.   Goodnight Sweetheart.","US 4 - Mile 1701.9

I left early to hike ahead to a higher elevation so I could call Marlene to talk about sending a package to Hanover,  NH.  I got service and we got everything set up and as I hiked away there was a tall aluminum ladder on the trail leaning against the high rock I was on so that I could get down the other side. Did not realize until then that I was up on a high rock cliff. I will summarize for today. Mostly the same terrain with many ups and downs. Around lunch time I was at a side trail .1 mile to the top of a high knob where there is a privately owned cabin/Shelter that hikers can use.  It has a small deck on the roof that is accessible via a steep stairs/ladder. The view is great - 360 degrees and clear to many near and distant ridges. The place is called The Lookout - well named. Glider and I hiked ahead to the Wintturi Shelter for the night.

The elevation chart for today’s terrain looks like a sawtooth section up-down-up-down all day.  For some reason I was in the zone and was able to set a pace that I could maintain for the climbs and then fairly steady on the descents.   It went well for most of the day on a steady slog to the Thistle Hill Shelter.  Also rare for Vermont are road crossings but today I crossed many gravel and even paved roads regularly.  Near one of the gravel roads a note was posted that 2016 thru hiker Firefly and her husband bought property 200 yards down the road and welcomed hikers to their “Back Porch”.  I visited them and had a boiled egg, drink, and fruit.  For a couple of dollars I had real food and an early lunch to power me up the next mountain. They are a nice couple with a baby and just love the trail and hikers. I suspect a hostel at their property is in their future.  I finished up today at this shelter just an hour before the predicted rain showered down so I decided to sleep in the shelter instead of my tent.  I usually prefer my tent for privacy and bug proof living but just decided to avoid wet gear in the morning.  I’ll see how that turns out versus a crowded shelter.

The hike today was more typical Vermont sawtooth terrain but we made good time and crossed the Connecticut River between Norwich, VT and Hanover NH at 3:00 pm.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597064,"Today was a day in town to resupply, take care of prescriptions, do laundry, clean up, and get a little extra rest. All went well until we went to the restaurant for evening meal. As an afterthought I ordered some Italian garlic bread, trying to pack in as many calories as possible while my appetite and the availability of food were highest.  I bit into the bread and felt a tooth break. Not just any tooth.  In the early 1970’s I had much dental work done. That included bridges where I had lost molars as a teenager on the middle bottom each side.  As I understand a bridge, a tooth is fashioned to fill the gap and dental structures are attached to the neighbor teeth, front and back, to support the filler tooth, bridging the gap. The part of the tooth behind the bridge where the support is attached broke away.  My dentist and I have been watching these for many years.  So far they have been solid - he said some of the best work he’s ever seen. One bite and it was gone.  The actual bridge is still in place and the best I can do is avoid using it and hope it remains in place until I get back to Birmingham. Tough to do with the kind of food I eat out on the trail. What will I do if another incident occurs and the entire structure of the bridge gives way?   It’s not the kind of thing I’d like to do on the road with a strange Dentist in a faraway place with insurance questions and my regular dentist not involved. I have no pain. So far I have been able to function by just being careful. It’s a hard place to have to be careful though. I have over 400 miles left to hike.   If I leave the trail to have this work done in Birmingham I doubt I’d ever come back out. Too far and too much involved for me and everyone to think about a third attempt to finish. There are other things to do with my life and now is a great time where finishing the hike fits in as well as it ever will.  So I am leaving it in the Lord’s hands. I would like to finish now while I’m here. I am continuing on as best I can and trusting that He will show me/us the way to go.  Only I need to know His will in this clearly.  He can protect my tooth and I am trusting for that and a clear leading for each step of the way. I know Marlene has informed many of you of the situation. Thank you for praying for me. Please keep on and pray me to Katahdin if that is God’s will. If not I will accept that as well.

First full day into New Hampshire.  We had a hotel room in West Lebanon, NH since rooms in Hanover were pretty pricey.  We used Uber to travel back and forth. The trail comes up the hill from the Connecticut River crossing and onto the Dartmouth University campus in Hanover and winds it’s way thru town and the campus for a couple of miles before entering the woods at the back of one of the athletic practice fields.  The terrain is much like Vermont with a hint of the big granite boulders to come.  It is dry here with many streams dried up and water more scarce.  I am at the shelter for the evening with minimal water for tonight and over 6 miles hiking in the morning to the nearest source.  I am at Moose Mountain Shelter near the summit of Moose Mountain - no moose spotted yet.  I got a video from the south peak of Moose Mountain as I passed and will send to Marlene - nice view.  I am settling in for the night.  Nothing new to report on my dental situation.  Thanks everyone who is praying for me.   We continue to plan and modify plans for the approaching White Mountains.   Just have to do them.  Goodnight Sweetheart.","Hanover, NH

I was up and gone early, wanting to hike the six miles to the next shelter and it’s water source while the day was cool since the overnight shelter was dry.   A couple of miles ahead I came to a small flowing stream not mentioned in the guide and was happy to get water for the day and drink my fill. That made a side trip to the Trapper John Shelter unnecessary.   I tried to message Glider about the water source but had no phone service so was unable to let him know.   Next was a big climb to Holts Ledge where I got a video from the cliff side overlook and sent it to Marlene. Then lunch at Grant Brook and I filled every bottle with water to cover getting here today, evening meal, breakfast, and getting off this mountain in the morning because the water source here at the old Fire Warden Cabin on Smarts Mountain is noted as unreliable. Turns out there is a weak trickle down there but I’m set.  But it made for a heavy pack for this afternoons climb.  It was over 3000 feet elevation gain, some of it hand over hand steep.  One of the hardest climbs I’ve ever done.  Got here around 4.  There is a fire tower at the summit, shrouded in clouds. It is very windy and cold on this mountain.  I hope to climb the tower in the morning to see the view of many of the major peaks in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, and back to Vermont.  Hope to get a video as well.  A thunder storm is forecast and we’ve already had a few showers but with no thunder or lightning so far. Nearly time to bundle up and settle in for the night. The old wardens Cabin has a door and window panes so we should be able to keep the wind at bay. Hope to sleep well.

We had hikers packed in at the Fire Wardens Cabin on Smarts Mountain as we were shrouded in thick clouds. The wind was fierce at times.  Bags, a 23 year old young lady, and I were the first up and we took our gear outside to pack and then went to the base of the fire tower to eat breakfast. We had a good time talking and climbed the tower a couple of times but stopped half way up when the clouds eliminated any view.  After she left I tried again and was able to get so-so video but with most distant mountains invisible or dim in the mist.  Then I left for the long and punishing descent from Smarts Mountain, a little over 4 miles steeply down over wet rocky trail.  At the bottom I started right away up the side of Mount Cube, about 1500 feet gain, again steep and rocky.  New Hampshire is going to be like that. At the summit I sat on exposed rock slabs to have a quick lunch, followed by another harrowing descent.   Then one final 1100 foot climb to Ore Hill and the Ore Hill Campsite - former shelter site but I guess the shelter burned down. About a mile before we got to this campsite we ran into Omelette Man, a trail angel who fried me a big slice of fresh ham for a ham/bagel sandwich, and gave me a cold drink. That hit the spot.  Today it seemed hot and humid and I think I filtered and drank more water today than I ever have in one day - stopped at virtually every stream.  Some streams are dry and shelters and campsites seem to have unreliable water sources.  Phone service is spotty in this area so I will send pictures and videos and update my journal when I can.  Goodnight Sweetheart.","Fire Wardens Cabin - Smarts Mountain

I thought I heard the hiker who came in last night to set up a hammock shooing a bear away at about 5:00 this morning. Later when I got out and went over his direction he was packed and gone so I guess it was all ok.  Quickly broke camp and was away to hike in the early morning woods - my favorite time.  My destination, The Hikers Welcome Hostel, lay over 7 miles away with Mist Mountain and a couple of hills between.  I was on a mission and barely stopped the whole way.  I am here at the hostel and have showered and done laundry.  But most importantly I got my resupply box from Marlene (3 cheers) and am set to start into the White Mountains.  Mount Moosilauke is the first big mountain we hit, the first that rises above treeline.  The weather for tomorrow calls for heavy rain and thunderstorms so we have a decision to make as the hostel folks recommend not trying to climb and cross the mountain in such conditions. Weather predictions being what they are we will decide in the morning - not an exact science at all.   The next hundred miles or so have similar terrain and similar decisions along the way.  More weak phone service so I will update when I can.  I’m learning not to expect too much in the way of communication.

Today I climbed the first mountain in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.  We shuttled North and hiked back to the hostel carrying basic gear and supplies. The climb up the north slope was beautiful, following a cascading waterfall much of the way.  Very steep path with high rocks to climb and wood beam steps and rebar hand holds fitted onto the rocks.  Finally I hit the open grassy summit area and left the shelter of the trees. The wind was probably 50 mph and the temp was about 50 as well. At the rocky summit we got pictures and hung out in the shelter of a pile of boulders to block the wind.  Then we gingerly started out on the descent, anticipating the shelter of the trees ahead.  A fairly steep and rocky descent for most of the way with a little leveling off nearer the end. So it was a great start to this section. Back at the hostel Next Step walks in. Every year I choose about half a dozen hiker journals to follow on trailjournals.com and one this year was Next Step and his wife Which Way.  She is injured and off trail but he has continued on. I knew he was in the area and it was so nice to meet and we hit it off well last evening. Then Daddy Longlegs walks in - a hiker I knew well last year who also got seriously injured, ending his hike too.  We had a great time catching up and comparing notes.  So Glider and I have put together our plan for the next 10 days and will go out in the morning heading north. Most likely plans will change but we will be flexible as needed. It is very cold here now, 47 degrees. Better for hiking but concerning for being at high elevation. We will see.  Communication has been very weak and not expected to improve.  
Marlene and I have traded a few texts and I have gotten the occasional pictures thru.  Virtually no videos have successfully made it.  Precious times.  Goodnight Sweetheart.","Hiker’s Welcome Hostel

Wow!  What a day.  We shuttled out to Kinsman Notch and began a long climb right from the road to the summit of Mount Wolf.  Then a long descent to Eliza Brook Shelter for lunch. Then the tough stuff began.  Possibly the hardest and steepest I’ve ever done.  For about a mile the trail ran nearly beside Eliza Brook coming down the huge steep ravine coming down from South Kinsman Mountain.  After that the trail wandered off away from the brook towards the summit. A very long steep slope.  So steep that this 69-year-old’s neck could not bend enough to see the trail running above me.  A continuous rock and boulder scramble up the side in never ending succession. The hardest climb I’ve ever done. Finally mounting the summit of South Kinsman  I got a video and talked with two young hikers who thought that North Kinsman Mountain was that little rise a few hundred yards away.  Turns out it was a significant dip then a climb to a pretty prominent peak a mile away. So I did that and then a steep descent to the Kinsman Pond and Kinsman Pond Shelter.  I was exhausted but very happy to be here. Filtered water and had evening meal as a crowd of about a dozen hikers showed up. There is a caretaker here who is with the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) and she collects $10 per Hiker for the night.  Welcome to the White Mountains.   I hope to sleep well tonight as I am exhausted and have many aches and pains.  No phone service so I continue to collect journal entries, photos and videos.  Hope to talk to Marlene soon.

During the night a helicopter made a couple of runs around our area and over the pond. We were wondering if there was a rescue somewhere. This morning the caretaker told me the National Guard likes to use the area for practice because of the terrain.  She was not thrilled though because apparently they  buzzed so close to her tent area that her equipment and quarters blew and vibrated.  I was up first and packed and went to the path to the pond to eat breakfast where it was absolutely quiet. As others came by they all commented on the quiet in hushed tones.  The pond was placid, reflecting the mountainside bathed in sunlight at the peak. 
I loaded up to hike to Lonesome Lake and the Lonesome Lake Hut, about two miles away.  Lonesome Lake is the body of water I showed in the video I sent to Marlene from atop the mountain. The trail down was steep and rocky.  Very technical in places and would be treacherous in wet conditions.   The huts are reservation only places to stay throughout the White Mountains. Thru hikers can sometimes get work-for-stay spots. The “Croo” at the huts will select a couple of hikers in the late afternoon to do chores mostly related to meals for the paying guests in exchange for sleeping on the floor and all the food they want after the guests have eaten.  I may get to do that at a hut further north.  Also, if you time it right like this morning they let thru hikers eat all leftover food because they have to pack it out if it’s not eaten. Hiking in only, no road access.  All perishable supplies also carried in via pack by the Croo.  Very expensive place and spartan conditions.  I got free scrambled eggs, sausage, fruit and coffee - all I wanted.  Then about three more miles down to Franconia Notch. Along the way I met two guys from the shelter last night who were ending their short hiking trip and had come down a different side trail. One had a pickup at the parking area about a mile from the Notch and offered me, Glider, and another hiker named Craig a ride into Lincoln. We learned that the weather for the next several days is expected to be bad because of a tropical storm. Many inches of rain and high winds are predicted.  The next several days at the high elevations north of us do not look good for hiking.  The weather is a major topic for the whole east and northeast.  We are unsure how the next few days will go.  We may have to hold up to see when things change.   The three of us have a room for the night.  Craig is taking a few days off in Boston to let a foot injury heal.  Glider and I are unsure at this point.  The next section is about a three day commitment for us once we climb out of Franconia Notch.  We are looking for a window and will play it by ear.  These steep mountainsides are dangerous when it’s raining.  I hope to talk with Marlene by phone tomorrow.  It’s been a long time without much communication.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598246,"I have avoided writing my thoughts on the last few days here in Lincoln NH waiting for the weather to clear because I am at a loss for words.  The hike on Friday was so long ago that I’ve almost forgotten what it’s like to make progress and log more miles onto my total.  A few people I know have hiked ahead during that time. They describe very difficult conditions and few opportunities to see anything but clouds and more rain with high winds. These hikers are the ones who were talking about hiking 20 to 25 miles a day with some regularity.  I do not have that kind of range any more.  If I got caught in the high elevation in a bad storm I would try to hike a long day/distance but I don’t know how well I would do.  Their daily totals have dropped sometimes below 10 miles. That reality made staying put seem the better choice.  It is very hard to stop hiking when you are used to hiking every day and racking up some miles.  But it is a choice many of us have gone with.  Much of my information comes from SOBO hikers (hiking from Maine to Georgia) who were already in the White Mountains when this weather pattern began, hiking south.  They describe pretty tough conditions.  They are stopping here to recover while northbound hikers are collecting here to wait for a better weather window.  It will be good to finally move forward.  I wonder how well I will do after so much idle time. The next 3+ days north will take me over Franconia Ridge and a series of mountains to the next gap called Crawford Notch, where we will need to resupply.  Then the next major obstacle is Mount Washington and it’s neighbors.   It is the highest section in New England and the second highest peak on the whole trail behind Clingman’s Dome in the Smoky’s.   But Mount Washington and that section is the most difficult and dangerous part of the entire trail.  Then comes a series of mountains called the Wildcats, which end near the Maine border and finish up the difficult White Mountains.  Mountains do not stop and disappear in Maine, but the White Mountains are a specific obstacle for thru hikers and are a major goal for me to complete now.  The last few days have been a series of downpours with a few minutes between when it stops.  That has happened half a dozen times just while I have written this story.   Everything happening down here in town is exaggerated at the higher elevation.   I have been torn between holding steady and just taking off and dealing with whatever comes.   We have been watching a weather report from the Mount Washington Observatory which is specific to the higher peaks. Tomorrow (Thursday) it may begin to clear out the system that has been stalled in this part of the country.  Our plan is to hike out tomorrow and climb up to just below Franconia Ridge top and camp. Then the next morning we will quickly finish the climb to the shoulder and go over 4 or 5 mountains along Franconia Ridge and down to a shelter back below tree line on the other side for the night.  We are counting on the weather to trend toward clearing by Thursday night as forecast.  I am very excited to get going in the morning. The next section is hard, but beautiful if you can see it.   Marlene sent me a copy of her ladies bible study notes where they talked about God being in control of the weather.  I’d rather have Him in control than anybody.  It was good to renew my understanding of who controls my life.   Thanks to all of you who are following and are concerned for my safety and success.   Please continue to pray as I move forward tomorrow.   It may be hard to communicate the next few days until I reach Crawford Notch - 3 to 4 days.  Thanks in advance for your concern.","Franconia Notch

It rained all night in Lincoln, NH, heavily.    I was concerned the forecast for the high elevations would change back to the bad stuff.   We were ready to go at 9 and loaded up to get to the trailhead.  It was a wet and sloppy morning on the road.  That was nothing compared to the woods.  We had about a mile to walk to get to the Appalachian Trail but the side trail was a muddy slippery mess. Runoff streams crossing and running down the path. Our shoes were soaked in a few minutes. Then you don’t worry about it anymore.  There is a footbridge where we left off. The other day it was a nice quiet stream.  Today it was a howling roaring torrent undulating up and down as it crashed thru the stream bed, now twice as wide as the other day.   So it was a nearly 3 mile climb straight up the side to the shoulder of Franconia Ridge from Franconia Notch.  Climbing a rock pile with every step up a distance to make you strain and pull.  Feet soaked by the running water from nearly a week of drenching rain with no place else to go.  That’s why we wanted to knock out this climb so we could tackle the ridge and Little Haystack Mountain, Mount Lincoln, Mount Lafayette,  and Mount Garfield tomorrow without the added strain of getting up here.  So that has gone well.  Our packs are full and heavy but the rest and just the pull to get going again powered us up the mountain. We got here and set up tents, then spent nearly the rest of the daylight hours in a rain storm. It is nearly dark but we can see what we hope is the beginning of clearing in the west and above us.  If so, tomorrow will be hard but also beautiful.

Our plan for today worked out well enough. I was up early and ready to leave by 6:30.   A steep climb up to Franconia Ridge and a round about route to get to the bottom of Little Haystack (don’t let the “little” fool you).  At the summit I entered the alpine zone, above tree line.  Scant vegetation on an open summit with lots of piles of rocks and huge stacks of boulders.  I could see for miles, both along the ridge and the route over the summits of the line of peaks ahead and the distant views to ridges and mountains both those I had already hiked over and some north coming up.   I crossed Little Haystack and then Lincoln.  Then Lafayette rose up ahead to challenge me.  It was a tough series of progressively higher boulder piles to a windswept summit. Then the descent.  It will be hard to use new language to describe the trip down the back of Lafayette.  I won’t try.  It was very hard and long.  Ahead the last mountain of the day rose up - Mount Garfield.  It took a long difficult hike just to get to the beginning of the Garfield climb.   Then 750 feet straight up.  I began to hear thunder. Only one clap hit close above me.  Never in danger.   It began to rain on the climb and continued as I hit the summit and began the descent to the shelter area.  On the way down the very high step ups continued and I hurt my right knee stepping down from about a 4 foot high rock.  Concerned, but not sure how it will do tomorrow.  There is a nasty descent to finish off Garfield and then both the climb and descent of South Twin Mountain right away in the morning.  I will see how that goes.   It is not a good location for a knee injury.  Many miles to the nearest road. So we are packed into the shelter with the rain coming down.   Just have to make it work. No phone reception at this remote location. Goodnight Sweetheart","Liberty Springs Campsite

I spent a sleepless night in a packed shelter unable to get comfortable and concerned about my painful right knee. I was unsure if I would be able to hike today.  The shelter emptied out early as many hikers were wanting to go big miles today.  I got up and tried to do morning chores normally.  My knee continued to be painful.  I took 2 Advil and Glider lent me a knee brace - he has two.  The first part of the hike was to finish the impossible to describe descent from Mount Garfield.  My knee handled that ok as I could keep it fairly straight most of the time. Then an up and down hike across the distance to Galehead Hut where we stopped in for a bowl of soup and a pastry and coffee.    My knee seemed to handle that fine and I suspect that once it loosens up it is ok but when I am still it gets stiff.   I may have strained something on the inside side of the right knee joint.  I was concerned I might have to stop but so far today is encouraging.   Hope it doesn’t stiffen up again tonight.   The next concern was a 1500+ foot climb up South Twin Mountain.  That was tough but went ok and the descent was more of the same brutal pounding but God answered my prayers and I continued to hike here to Guyot Shelter for the night.  We only went 5.5 miles today to give me a chance to work my knee.  I am pleased with the way it went.  Probably no road crossing until day after tomorrow, with a long day tomorrow to the road a possibility depending on how the day goes.   I tried again for over an hour to get a message to Marlene but no service or service too weak for a text to go.  She’s probably worried - no messages for a couple of days.  Goodnight Sweetheart","Garfield Ridge Shelter/Campsite

Successful day back to civilization.  I am pleased that my knee served me well on a long hike.  It was mostly a downhill trip today.  The shelter last night was located about a mile off the trail and down a steep rocky side trail. The return to the Appalachian Trail was one of the bigger climbs for the day - back up to the main trail and then the completion of the hike to the summit of Mount Guyot. Then a long descent about 4 miles to Zealand Falls Hut where I got a nice hot bowl of soup, plus all the free cold oatmeal leftover from breakfast that I wanted.  Our original plan was to get to Ethan Pond Campsite to spend the night and then on to Crawford Notch in the morning to resupply. My knee did great today and the downhill hiking was going well so we just kept going and got out to the highway at Crawford Notch.  We hitchhiked to a convenience store to resupply.  Then we got a room and it felt so good to clean up and do laundry.  Tomorrow we will continue north by climbing and hiking over Mount Webster and Mount Jackson to a campsite.  Then the approach to Mount Washington the following day, finishing about 1.5 miles short of and about 1200 feet below the summit.  That will set us to climb the big mountain first thing the following morning, with a long traverse above treeline that must be crossed before the end of the day.   I can still feel tenderness in my knee when I do certain movements but the action of hiking seems to go fine as long as I keep it from getting stiff. Lying in a sleeping bag in cramped quarters is the worst.  These big mountains have a steepness and ruggedness that is hard to describe.  Sometimes I think that if Marlene actually saw them and the almost ridiculous trail sometimes she would tell me to come home.   But I have to take it one step at a time and concentrate.  It’s the only way to finish this up.  So pray for each step of the way.  Phone service is virtually nonexistent so I’m not sure when I will update again or even get a message out.  We talked this evening and that was nice.  Goodnight Sweetheart.","Guyot Shelter

We were resupplied and ready to go last evening after hitching a ride to the Irving Store for hiking food and pizza by the slice and subs for supper.  A young man in the parking lot drove us to the hotel.   So good to get a shower and do laundry after four wet days in the mountains - I could hardly stand myself.   Microwaved sandwiches for breakfast, then out to the road to get a hitch.  We got a ride half way with a local man hiking today with a friend to the same location as us - Mizpah Hut.   He hiked up by a shorter local trail.  After that first ride we were later picked up by the AMC Shuttle guy and we were quickly at the trailhead in Crawford Notch.   The climb up to Webster Cliffs, then Mount Webster, then Mount Jackson totaled 2800 feet pretty much straight up. We were surprised at how quickly we made it to the views at Webster Cliffs.  I got a video and some pictures looking back down to NH Route 302 and the route of our resupply and overnight travels.  It was straight down below us a long steep way.  Then we got to Mount Webster by lunch where I was able to send texts and videos to Marlene.  It then seemed to take a long time to reach the summit of Mount Jackson, followed by a couple more miles to the Mizpah Hut where we intended to set up tents for the night. The Croo guy offered us work-for-stay and we accepted both for tonight and tomorrow morning’s breakfast.  Basically we can sleep in the dining room tonight in exchange for doing chores after the paying guests finish their meals tonight and at breakfast.  We also get to eat both meals with the Croo.  I think every hiker should try that at least once, so it worked out well. It will be especially nice if we are indoors tonight if the weather gets wet.  I will update with the details of this adventure once we finish up our duties later.  So we are within clear sight of huge Mount Washington and have seen it most of the day.   Many times in the clouds but also sometimes clear at the summit.   We can see the long route over there to near the summit for tomorrow’s hike, then the long route across the Washington summit and the other peaks. All are above tree line and all must be cleared before we can stop for the night on Wednesday.  Weather tomorrow looks fine so far but Wednesday may not be good.

Work for stay update:  Five of us got work for stay.

After our work for stay chores we loaded up right away and 10 feet from the back of the hut began the long climb up Mount Pierce.  Soon the trail approached the alpine region again with many exposed humps between the major peaks above tree line with the dips between bordered by scrub pines.  I like hiking above tree line where you can see the trail route ahead and what’s coming up.  Today’s named peaks included Mounts Pierce, Eisenhower, Franklin and Monroe.   With the exception of some significant dips between peaks the route was all uphill as we approach the granddaddy of them all - Mount Washington.   So it was a boulder climbing day.   I am at Lakes of the Clouds Hut, an AMC Hut sitting on a saddle about 1200 feet below the summit of Mount Washington. They offer a basement room called “the dungeon” where 6 thru hikers can pay to stay in a basic stone room under the foundation of the hut on 2x4 and plywood bunks.  Pretty dank and dark but out of the weather. The forecast for tomorrow does not look especially good.  We thought the morning would be nicer but the outlook changes and we are unsure.  We are still planning to leave as early as we can and will make final decisions at the time.  It is a long and difficult exposed ridgeline walk for about 10 miles to a tent site with no bail-out points.  So this is the one we’ve been waiting for.  Please pray for it to go well.

From the earliest miles on a north-bound thru hike the “White Mountains “ of New Hampshire are a topic of discussion among the hikers. They are used to claim legitimacy among those who have experienced them or their fearsome reputation causes the hiker to wonder and anticipate what they must be like.  In the south it is easy to put it out of your mind but as you approach the mid Atlantic states their presence up there standing between you and Maine cannot be ignored.  Chief among them is the big brother peak - Mount Washington - with its reputation for causing deaths over the years and the “worst weather in the world”.   My day had finally come.  I was sleeping in it’s shadow last night. Yesterday’s weather was great and the peak stood proud above the assembled hikers below at Lakes of the Clouds Hut.  Today’s weather was more sketchy and we did not know what to expect.   It is a safety issue but also NOBO thru hikers have wanted a clear day to experience this climb and the views to the surrounding peaks and valleys for over 1800 miles.  At first light I got up to see the birth of the new day.  There were high clouds but a mostly clear sky - crystal clear at the summit with a slight hint of rosy sun tinting the edges of the high clouds - the light a silvery metal color. The mountain stood in clear gray and purple hues, almost sparkling, as the dawn advanced through its stages.   Glider and I agreed to be ready early and we set off first I think. When we left the mountain was completely shrouded in clouds with what appeared to be high winds, demonstrating the fickle nature of Mount Washington weather.   The hike up is climbing a rock pile, about 1200 feet.  As I approached the various high ridges and false summits the clouds whipped around me in the high winds, sometimes thick and soupy and other times just wisps stretched into long thin lines.  The wind became a factor as I hopped from rock to rock in a precarious battle to land on my feet, balanced and upright.  Trail over a rock pile is hard to follow. There were no blazes as I remember, but just little (and some bigger) conical piles of stones, called cairns, stretched out in a long line to mark the way. One or two would be visible, the others only there by faith, not by sight, in the swirling cloud. Nearer the top the violent winds began to open up clear areas where I would get a glimpse of the high ridge line or even one of the buildings or communication towers and other equipment along the summit.  It was like feeling my way along even though there was some visibility. It was exhilarating to be part of it, maybe a little eerie.  I “felt” my way between the various buildings and boulder piles to finally find the “Mount Washington Summit” sign. Soon I saw Glider approach and asked him to get a picture, not knowing whether things would clear any better for us.  We exchanged these duties and then found the building where we hoped the visitors center and snack bar would be. Sure enough, a little while later I saw life inside and then they opened the doors and let us in.   We spent about 90 minutes inside and later outside as the weather cleared in short spurts, and then more generally, finally opening up for great pictures and videos of the mountain and the surrounding peaks and valleys.  I even got a video of the first cog railroad run for the day as the belching coal fired engine chugged up the line about 30 feet away as I made my way down from the summit - the passengers taking pictures of the hiker as the hiker was taking pictures of them.   The presidential range includes Washington, Clay, Jefferson, Adams, and Madison along with various other prominent peaks and ridges along the way - all presenting significant climbs, descents, and nasty rock piles as the trail treadway.  It was like the Pennsylvania rocks on steroids and the soles of my feet feel as if they have been pounded with a hammer.  As expected, about mid morning the general weather for the area deteriorated. I was in high winds and blowing cloud banks all day.  A long and difficult day even though we cut it short to stay tonight at the Madison Spring Hut to escape the weather and rest from the day.  Craig, a hiker we were with before the big weather delay in Lincoln, was there also so we reconnected with him. Tomorrow we will hike the final descent to Pinkham Notch, resupply in Gorham NH, and get ready for the next section - the Carter-Moriah Range (sometimes called The Wildcats).  I had momentary phone service atop Mt Washington and sent Marlene a cryptic text that I was at the summit.  No response, and I had no service the rest of the day.  So I am moving across New Hampshire slowly over the most difficult terrain yet.  Today was all I wanted it to be.  Hopefully I will be able to communicate some of the highlights tomorrow.  Goodnight Sweetheart","Lakes of the Clouds Hut

After yesterday it’s hard to imagine a bigger day but climbing Mount Madison is not for sissies.  Really the climb itself was just 500 or 600 feet up a pile of boulders like the other climbs.  But this mountain can lead you on in that you keep climbing over higher and higher “summits” along an extended ridge line. Still though you can see what’s coming and it’s fun to see the progress, especially on fresh morning legs. Craig was in the lead and I would catch him or see him ahead unless hidden by the next hump going up or descending. Glider was similarly spaced behind. But, similar to yesterday, the descent goes on forever.  Just as the ridge line on the way up had repeating climbs the descent had a long long ridge of repeating humps descending, sometimes so formidable in their own right that they hid each other from view. Many of the descents were very technical.  My pace was slowed to a crawl all morning just planning each step down the face of the steep drop offs.  Below tree line the scrub pines closed in on the edge of the trail causing me and my equipment to catch and scrape - my legs are almost raw below the knee.  But it is so good to have the Presidential Range complete.  Hikers have short memories. We came to the road and got picked up by the Rattle River Hostel.  I am cleaned up, resupplied, and have gone thru everything to see what food and gear I can leave behind tomorrow as we go out again trying to complete the Wildcats in two days.  We plan to tent tomorrow night about midway thru that range and hike back to the hostel the next day.  I plan to take a zero day then.  Rest and resupply will be sorely needed - literally.   It’s almost hard to believe that the end of New Hampshire is within grasp.   Marlene and I talked this evening and I think I have her up to date with pictures and videos.  That was a nice time to catch up even if briefly.   So good to have her there and keeping tabs on me each step of the way.

I was on the 7:00 shuttle to Pinkham Notch to start into the Carter-Moriah Range (and Wildcats).  We were planning to hike about half of the 21 miles back to Gorham, NH and the Rattle River Hostel and tent somewhere  in the woods tonight, finishing up on Saturday by hiking the remaining miles back to the hostel and taking a zero day to rest and plan the next section.  That went fairly well and we are set up in a rain-soaked stealth site along the trail ready to get some sleep and anticipating getting back into wet hiking gear in the morning to make the long trek back. Today was a tough hike up the peaks of Wildcat Mountain - peaks E, D, C, and A. I guess peak B must not be on the AT.  As we made our way on the first big climb we could see Mount Washington, sometimes clear and often clouded in, and we could sort of compare our ascent against the height of that mountain.  Wildcat Peak A was about a 2400 foot climb, followed by an 1100 foot descent, before a 1500 foot climb up Carter Dome.  Rain threatened most of the day.  We got wet in the afternoon and all the way to the camp site for the night.  I hear heavy raindrops now as I write.  Mid morning I took a fall.  Trying to avoid planting my face on a rock when both feet slipped out from beneath me, I arched my back. That worked to protect my face and teeth but I took the upper body blow to the chest, knocking the wind out.  I think I have pulled a muscle on my right chest. Two Advil helped. When my feet gave way on the wet rock both shins hit hard on the sharp corner of the rock, causing yet more skin to be scraped away and probably some bruising of the muscle and shin bones. Around lunch time we were at the Carter Notch Hut and the Croo person brought out the first aid kit to clean my “wounds” and put bandages on with Neosporin. That was nice but the rain and my sweat made them fall off during the afternoon hike. I am a real mess.  So I am listening to the pounding of the rain as darkness sets in.  I will be very happy to finish the Wildcats tomorrow. Then plans begin to get to Maine.  It sounds like southern Maine is a continuation of the ruggedness of the White Mountains, maybe worse.  Not a happy prospect after the tough day today, but right now  rest is so sweet.  No service on this remote mountainside.

The rain from yesterday afternoon continued all night and into the afternoon today.  We found a stealth campsite that accommodated both our tents, sort of. The Wildcat Mountains are a continuous rock pile with almost no make-do tent sites around. So we made do.  Everything was soaked.  Sometimes I try to take down my tent in a certain sequence to keep the tent piece dry while still under the rain fly. Today both pieces were saturated as the spot had collected a puddle overnight, and the rain was still coming down. I slept on rocks and roots but got ok rest.  I had inches to spare for the tent to fit between the trees and other obstacles.   I left with Glider still in his tent.  About 10 feet down the trail I realized there was no way to keep my feet dry. The trail was a series of ponds connected by rushing streams.  So I just stomped on thru. It was actually a relief to just get my feet wet and then forget about it.  I wanted to finish the climb up Middle Carter Mountain and North Carter Mountain and the treacherous descent down the north slope to the Imp Campsite. Treacherous it was. Steep, rocky, technical, 50 foot high drop-offs with rain coming down, and most of the time in a wild stream of runoff water, sometimes a foot deep. When it leveled off up on the summits there were plank boardwalks submerged in the flood stage water, sometimes sinking up to my knees.   The climb to Mount Moriah was a relief.  I had the runoff stream coming at me from above but somehow felt more stable going up than trying to come down the slab rock faces.   My “up muscles “ handled the work better than the “down muscles”.   Rumor had it that once I made the summit of Mount Moriah I had the hard stuff done.   The first few miles of the descent were more difficult than coming down from the Carter peaks earlier.  I fell about a dozen times, aggravating the sore shins.  But the worst was a sideways fall down a slab chute similar to the fall in New Jersey last year that sent me home.  It put a strain on my sore right knee and the pulled muscle in my chest.   I sat in about a foot of water half way down the chute counting my parts to make sure everything was still there and still working.  Then I burst out laughing.  It seemed so absurd.  The final comic relief came when I fell again and did a backwards summer-salt in the stream coming down the trail. I guess everything wasn’t wet enough so I gave it a final soaking.  All the way I was crossing dozens of smaller streams and walking down their courses, sometimes seeing half a dozen at a time coming down the mountain in  a braided weave to come together and form what became the Rattle River. The promised flattening out of the trail began gradually. Then I eventually came to 5 or 6 places where I needed to ford the river, each one lower down the mountain and having collected more of the wild water, coming up above my knees.  The last ford was iffy, but I found a wider place upstream about 75 yards where it was fast but not as deep.  Get ready for that in Maine.  The last 3 miles were a nice flatter trail with even some soil showing through the rocks.  I put myself on auto pilot and woke up when I got to the hostel.  I was completely spent and sat on a chair in the yard staring off into the trees and talking quietly with El Gringo Loco.  We came the last little way together.  I had not seen Glider since I left the campsite.   I showered and got settled. That was the limit of my ability to function. Resting. Goodnight Sweetheart. 
Sunday Update
I decided to take a second zero day tomorrow. My aches and pains are not healed.  It seems prudent to give my feet and legs a rest and let my knee and chest muscle have a chance to heal.  The mountains ahead in southern Maine are reputed to be harder than these, if that even seems possible.  The Rattle River Hostel is inexpensive and very accommodating so I will stay here.  Marlene and I talked and that is the plan. Nice to have a trail boss who understands.","Stealth Campsite - Mile 1881.7

Today was the day to try out my legs again.  I knew right away yesterday that it was the right decision to take another day to rest as I was stumbling around in the hiker hobble.  We had a full day planned for today.  When 5:00 came I was down in the hostel kitchen to make myself pancakes and coffee, along with the OJ and fruit from Walmart on last evening’s shuttle run.  I bandaged my “wounds “ as best I could to protect my scabby legs, and put the brace on my knee.  For some reason both ankles were swollen yesterday and that continued today, sore but no overt injuries I know of.   I was ready to go by 7:00 as I checked in with Glider, then left.  The AT goes right by the hostel and down a couple of side roads before  entering the woods in about 3/4 mile.  That was a good warmup on pavement and later gravel.   Then the climb to Mount Hayes of about 1800 feet. Much of the trail today was less steep than the Wildcats were the other day.  The absence of a rushing stream of runoff helped as well. It’s always a little extra work to get going after a zero day, but it went well. I hiked steadily until lunch time then took a half hour to eat and rest.  Then right back at it.  The day was full of both climbs and descents of 500 to 1000 feet. The trail was rocky and muddy but not wet.  There were many areas of significant blow down damage from a storm with much of it having been cleared, with logs and piles of branches everywhere.   I passed by Page Pond, Dream Lake, and finally came to Gentian Pond to this shelter and campsite.  Glider came in about an hour later.  I had not seen him since this morning at the hostel.  As I was setting up and getting water the thunder rumbled. The rain soon came.  I am in my tent early as there is little else to do when it rains. My body seems to have handled the day fine.  I did notice that the swelling in both ankles has gone down but the inside of the left ankle has a big bruise showing purple.  Not sure what caused that or anything I can do about it. They both now look normal size.  There were few views today and little of note except that around 11:45 I passed the 1900 mile point from Georgia.  If tomorrow goes well I will cross into Maine.  I need to sleep well tonight. No phone service here. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Gorham NH - Rattle River Hostel

Out early to climb Mount Success.  It can either signify successfully finishing New Hampshire or getting into Maine.  I’ll take both.  Around 11:30 this morning I was at the state line sign. So good to be in the last state.  Got pictures and sent them to Marlene.  After that I climbed Mount Carlo and the West, East, and North peaks of Goose Eye Mountain.  Some say the hiking in Maine is harder than the White Mountains was, and so far I agree, seeing no relief at all.  Very difficult trail all day.  I feel beat up and tired tonight so I will only summarize the day.    I’m camped in my tent at the Full Goose Shelter and Campsite. Need rest.  Tomorrow the “hardest mile on the trail” - Mahoosic Notch.  That’s followed by a huge climb up Mahoosic Arm.  I will describe more in detail tomorrow.  I was worried about the sores on my shins and the bruising on the right shin especially.  I prayed for help if it was needed and in walks a southbound thru hiker named of all things “Nurse”. He is a VA nurse.  He saw my sores and pulled out a med kit to dress them and put on antibiotic cream.  Gave me instructions what to do tomorrow when I get to camp.  So God answers prayer.   As I think about getting to Maine, there still seems so much to do. It is a huge trail through wild and ever more remote country. However,  while crossing a state line is a great milestone every time, it’s almost like a person is standing there to hand you an envelope with the number of miles in that new state written on a slip inside.  You’ve just finished 150 miles in Vermont, now here’s 160 miles to do in New Hampshire.   This time the end point is Katahdin right here in Maine.  So I count down the Maine miles and nothing will change.  It’s a funny but also a great feeling.  Nothing will move the goal post this time.  Goodnight Sweetheart.","Gentian Pond Shelter/Campsite

Two notable obstacles were on the menu for today - Mahoosic Notch and Mahoosic Arm.  First I had to do a 500 foot climb up Fulling Mill Mountain, then a 1000 foot descent to the south end of Mahoosic Notch.  Two mountains stand nearly side by side with a deep and steep V-shaped ravine between them.  You can see the Cliffs straight up where the house and dump truck-sized boulders broke off and fell into the ravine.  The Notch is a mile long.  The trip through is reputed to be both the toughest and slowest mile on the entire trail.  Hikers all know about it and look forward to their time in “the Notch”.  We took about 2 1/2 hours to get thru.  I have some pictures but none do it justice.  We did it in the rain today, making it extra treacherous. It is a mile of climbing around and over and under these huge rocks just flung into the narrow passage.  Half a dozen times we had to go thru tunnels under the pile and many times we drug our packs behind us or pushed them through the passages ahead of us.  There is a stream beneath the rocks and there is snow and ice too as it does not melt due to lack of sunlight. Knowing that it’s coming made us relax and not worry about speed and distance today and it was a fun time.  We got a few scrapes but nothing serious.  When we finished we stopped for lunch before the climb up Mahoosic Arm which is a notable steep climb and a real punch in the gut when paired with the Notch.   Then after one of the steepest 1700 foot climbs I’ve ever done I had a steep descent to Speck Pond and the shelter and campsite for the night.  So today will be memorable, as every hiker remembers their time in Mahoosic Notch.   I’m tenting near this beautiful alpine pond.  There are mountains all around so no phone service today or tonight.  Goodnight Sweetheart.","Full Goose Shelter and Campsite

Short day planned to get to Grafton Notch and the Pine Ellis Hostel near Andover, Maine.   I left before 7:00 for the climb to the summit of Old Speck, a high sharp-topped mountain.  The day was windy and the mountain was shrouded in blowing clouds with near zero visibility.  The climb went surprisingly well.  Just before the sharp summit is a shoulder of bare rock, exposed and void of vegetation. As I approached the wind nearly blew me off the mountain but also appeared to be creating gaps in the clouds.  I quickly retrieved my phone and got a great video looking back toward Speck Pond and the whole mountainside was bathed in golden sunshine with a great view.  The wind continued strong and interfered with my narration but I got a nice shot of the mountains of southern Maine.  Shortly I reached the side trail to the actual summit and the steep and sometimes gradual and pleasant descent to Grafton Notch began.  Part of the hike down ran beside a stream with a solid rock stream bed causing the water to tumble over drop offs creating cascading waterfalls.  Finally at the parking lot and trailhead I was greeted by some 2016 thru hikers doing trail magic.  They had an awning set up and were serving hot dogs, burgers, chips and soft drinks.  Glider came in and got the same treatment.  We waited about an hour for the hostel shuttle to get us but the hiker feed made it seem mere minutes.  We are at the Pine Ellis Hostel.  They offer as many as 4 days of slackpacking possibilities that we are looking at.  Slackpacking is when you carry a light pack with just the day’s essentials and are dropped off at a point along the trail and either hike back to the hostel or to an agreed upon pick up point.  It offers a chance to make some progress but without the heavy pack.  In light of my present beat up condition after the White Mountains and the Mahoosics I hope to take advantage of this time to recover a little.  We will work out the specifics as we go.  So I have showered, retrieved my resupply box and am doing Hiker town chores.  It’s slow, but I am making my way into the mountains of southern Maine.  Goodnight Sweetheart.","Speck Pond Shelter & Campsite

Slackpacked today.  We were dropped of at Grafton Notch this morning and had a steep 2100 foot climb up to the West Peak of Baldpate Mountain. It had a smaller open area of bare rock surrounded by some scrub vegetation including ripe wild blueberries.  I got some of those.  There is a great view to the East Peak of Baldpate Mountain showing the deep dip between them in bare rock mostly and the steep ledges of bare rock to climb back up to the higher summit of the East Peak.  It was a long scramble to the summit but I really like climbing in the open and on the barren rock ledges so it was fun.  I got a video from there.  The descent down the back was nearly a straight drop off.  We had lunch and got water at the Frye Notch Lean-To.  After a 500 foot climb the trail took an easier turn for the afternoon with about 4 miles of more pleasant terrain including some nice streams and waterfalls in a pleasant forest.  We are back at the hostel and ready to do a similar hike tomorrow.  Moving across Maine slowly.  Goodnight Sweetheart.","Grafton Notch, Maine Highway 26 Trailhead

(Note: Progress above shows todays hiking as if done northbound) We hiked this section from the north end, hiking south.  Doing that allowed us to face the tough stuff on fresh morning legs.  First a 1400 foot climb up to Moody Mountain followed by a steep drop into Sawyer Notch, Sawyer Road, and Sawyer Brook.  Then abruptly back up again 1500 feet to have lunch on the shoulder of Wyman Mountain at the shelter named Hall Mountain Lean-To.  After filtering water for the afternoon I finished the climb to the summit of Wyman Mountain.  The remaining 5 miles were generally downhill to the road in pleasant woods with some rocky and rooty sections and many mud pits.  It was a successful day moving across Maine.  I am back at the hostel planning to do the next section north tomorrow.  Great making some progress while also trying to rest and recover from carrying the heavy pack over rugged terrain.  Talked with Marlene this Sunday morning - always so good to hear her voice and have that time.  Goodnight Sweetheart.","East B Hill Road

A quick 5.7 miles from Maine Highway 4 near Rangeley to the summit of Saddleback Mountain then a side trail down to the ski lodge where we were picked up.  The beginning of the trip was nice trail with the usual rocky, rooty, muddy tread.  Saw a couple of pretty ponds but few other views in the wet and thick woods, especially in the cloud.  Then the hard stuff.  Getting to the first summit of Saddleback was over huge rock slabs tilted up on an angle, wet and slippery with few hand or foot holds.  This went on for a long time to get to the first shoulder of the mountain.   Saddleback has seven “summits” where you think you are getting there but each summit hides the next one.  Add to that the clouds and we could not tell where we were.  More slabs of stone to scramble over to gain the top of each summit in succession.  Finally thinking we were at the summit and the side trail down, I decided to get a video showing the stoney summit area and the misty clouds all around.   After I finished it cleared and we looked ahead 2/10 mile and saw the real summit above with a sign silhouetted so we hiked ahead to there where I got essentially the same video with great views all around the summits and down to the valley.  Sent both to Marlene so I guess you will get a comparison between the two.  Back at the hostel so I will update this when I have phone service again, possibly up on the mountain.  Tomorrow we will pick up again at the summit of Saddleback and go north for about 10 miles to another point where we can take a side trail to a logging road to meet the shuttle.   Moving on in Maine.  Goodnight Sweetheart.","Maine Highway 4 Crossing, Rangeley, Maine

Out on the shuttle at 7:00 and back to the ski lodge where we picked up the side trail to the summit of Saddleback Mountain.  The mountain was socked in clouds as was the next peak, The Horn.  When we got to the top of Saddleback Junior it was more clear so I got a video and sent it to Marlene.  All the mountains had nicer climbs on the southern ascent and very tough and steep descents going down the north side.  It seemed like we hiked slowly all day.  We took a logging road a mile to get picked up again and back to the hostel.  So no phone service until tomorrow when we will be atop mountains again, and in the hostel in Stratton where hopefully we will have electricity and service again.  Moving along in Maine.  Goodnight Sweetheart. 
PS.  My hiking shoes were new somewhere in Vermont but the terrain from there destroyed them.  The left one had pieces torn out of the soles and holes worn through the toe box.  The right one had the same plus the lace and the lace thread holders were broken and I tied them together with knots for the last 4 days of hiking.  True to form my trail boss came through with a new pair that arrived here yesterday.  These should take me to Katahdin, then back home to her.","Summit of Saddleback Mountain

Same routine, out at 7:00 to Barnjam Road and a quick 1 mile walk back to the trail crossing.  A 1000 foot climb to Lone Mountain, then about 700 feet to the Spaulding Mountain trail but skipped the side trip to the summit.  Hiking went faster today.  I passed a plaque commemorating the CCC of Maine who in 1937 near that spot completed the last section needed to finish the original Appalachian Trail end to end.  As it turns out, in 2018 this exact spot is the point at which a northbound hiker has exactly 200.0 miles to go to the summit sign on Mount Katahdin.  So that was great to mark the progress.   The trail does not go to the summit of Sugarloaf Mountain but the trail down the back side is extremely steep - like coming down a cliff face.  After a seemingly never-ending descent over the technical rock scramble and exposed boulders we got to a remote private gravel road and walked .3 miles to be picked up by the Stratton Motel and Hostel shuttle.  Planning the next section for tomorrow.  Also have a food drop from Marlene set for delivery in Caratunk, Maine next week.  Still moving ahead across Maine.   Goodnight Sweetheart","Barnjam Road Crossing

I’m sensing a pattern here as we traverse the big mountains of southern Maine.  It was raining overnight and still coming down so we delayed leaving until 7:30.  Then out to Caribou Valley Road and a quick .3 mile walk up to the trail.  Right away we hit the 1800 foot climb to South Crocker Mountain, hiking in the rain with the clouds close in all around.  Then a descent of about 400 feet and the climb up to North Crocker Mountain begins.  After about 650 feet it was good to have the major climbs for the day done.  The rain continued and the trail all day was a stream of water, but I’m very used to that scenario.  The descents were not killer steep today so the wet conditions did not create such hazardous hiking on the down hill sections. Rain yesterday would have been tough.  Shortly after noon I checked my location, knowing I was approaching the 2000.0 mile point from Springer Mountain in Georgia.   My Guthook app showed it approaching and sure enough we came to the 2000 Mile sign formed of sticks on the ground beside the trail.  This was kind of an emotional experience that I will probably describe in a separate entry once I have a chance to absorb it.  But so good to pass that milestone.  Out to the road a few miles later and we are back in town planning the next 4 days to Caratunk.  Goodnight Sweetheart","Caribou Valley Road Crossing

Out today with full packs to begin hiking the Bigelow Range, sometimes called “The Bigs”.   We are starting about 17 miles north and hiking south over Little Bigelow Mountain and Avery Peak to the Avery Memorial Campsite for the night and plan to hike back to Maine Highway 27 again tomorrow.  We will then spend the night in Stratton and pick up resupply for the following two days to the Kennebec River crossing and to Caratunk where I will receive a full resupply from Marlene.   Little Bigelow Mountain was an 1800 foot climb followed by a 2100 foot climb up Avery Peak after lunch.  The Avery Peak climb really took it out of me, finally arriving late in the day, but the scenery from the peak is among the best I’ve seen.  I got a video and sent it to Marlene, capturing the high mountains all around and the valleys filled with numerous lakes visible below.  Tomorrow I will climb slightly higher to Bigelow Mountain West Peak and South Horn before beginning a descent to the road again.   After that the Bigelow Range will be complete.  It is very cold tonight as we are tenting not far below the summit.  Thankfully no rain or high winds, at least so far.   Traded texts with Marlene tonite and sent a few pictures.   Moving along thru Maine.  Goodnight Sweetheart.","East Flagstaff Road (Hiking South)

Finished the Bigelow’s today, hiking southbound to the road.   Broke camp early and left to quickly climb Bigelow Mountain West Peak, just a little higher than Avery Peak.  I was at the summit around 7:00.  The view was much the same as from Avery last evening but somehow different in morning light.  The clouds over the lakes were particularly unique.  Very beautiful. Got a video and several photos and sent them to Marlene.  Continued on over rugged rocky terrain to climb South Horn and on to Horns Pond for a snack break.   Then a long steep rocky and rooty descent to Maine Highway 27.   Will go into Stratton for the night and resupply for two days to the crossing of the Kennebec River via canoe and then into Caratunk.  All for now.   Goodnight Sweetheart.","Avery Memorial Campsite

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600914,"On Saturday, May 27, 2017 I passed the 1000 mile point from the southern terminus on Springer Mountain in Georgia while hiking in the Roller Coaster in northern Virginia.  What a great feeling.   I remember the place and the day well.  On Tuesday, May 30 while resting in Harper’s Ferry West Virginia I recorded my thoughts on the hike so far and said this -
 “Crossing the 1000 mile mark means real miles to me. When that 1 becomes a 2, I will be in Maine, and I can actually see that happening.”
Now that seems so distant yet the words still ring true.  But I hardly have words to express my thoughts about all that has happened in the time between.  In the past I served on our church board as secretary and one of my responsibilities was to record the minutes of the official meetings.  Friends would remark that I would take a half page of cryptic notes and turn out a 6 or 7 page document that was rarely challenged on the details.  The details of all that has happened since that day in May last year are beyond my ability to describe.  It is too much.  There are so many mountains, streams, rocks, rainstorms, nights alone in the woods, high winds, slips and falls, aches and pains, self doubt, prayers for strength for the next single step, disbelief at the difficult next section of trail, steepness of the next climb or descent, loneliness, wonder at the beauty of God’s creation, heat, cold, bugs, questioning my sanity, all of that and so much more.  Add to that the normal events of life, my health, the needs of those I love, it goes on and on. Now the 1 has become a 2.  That seems so simple.  I recorded the 2000 miles marker I found by the side of the trail made of sticks.   I sent pictures to Marlene.  But as I hiked along after that tears welled into my eyes because the overwhelming events of getting to that point are bigger than me.   I am actually now in Maine.   How did that happen?  As of now I have less than 190 miles to go, and it continues to tick down.  There are still no guarantees.   In planning the next sections I am talking in terms of days.  It’s hard to believe.  I can’t really comprehend the details of that.   It’s hard to understand how anyone could be crazy enough to do this.  I’m 69 years old.  How can this possibly be happening.  Yet each day I creep a little closer to the end.  The first 1000 miles was an adventure.  I have no words to describe the second 1000 miles.  If I’d known how hard they would be I probably would not have come back out here, assuming it would be impossible.  Yet here I am.  So again, this far I have come with the help of the Lord.","Stratton, Maine

Long wet day but good progress made.   The shuttle dropped us off at East Flagstaff Road as the raindrops began to fall in earnest.  It was a soaking rain all day.  Everything is wet thru and thru.  The terrain today was tame, with a 500 foot climb and a 1000 foot climb and fairly nice easy descents.   The rest of the miles were fairly level.  Of course in Maine the rocks, roots, and mud are a permanent fixture but the longer day was done fine since there were no big mountains to climb.  I am set up in my tent ready for nightfall.  It still is trying to decide whether to keep raining or clear, but reports are that tomorrow will be nice.  I was able to get hikers at the hostel this morning to wish my grandson Jake a happy 6th birthday and send the video before I left town.  With the rain and no noteworthy things to see today my phone stayed in its plastic bag all day.  Got more birthday wishes at the shelter tonight but no phone service here.  So HAPPY 6th BIRTHDAY JAKE!!  I will update and send tomorrow.  Also, tomorrow I will hike to the Kennebec River in the morning and take the official canoe ferry across and then go into Caratunk to resupply and plan for the next section to Monson, Maine.   So I’m still moving ahead in Maine.  Goodnight Sweetheart.","East Flagstaff Road

The rain stopped overnight and to my surprise my tent and gear were mostly dry due to the wind.  Packed up, ate, and got on the trail to hike the 4 miles to the Kennebec River and the town of Caratunk. Short of town you are confronted with the river.   Due to tragedies in the past with hikers trying to cross on foot, the trail provides a canoe as the official crossing.  It even had a white blaze painted on it, signifying the trail.  I was third to arrive and the canoe takes two hikers and their gear per trip so I was on the second group.  Glider came in later but in time to video my crossing and I got his from the other side.   Then we hiked to the hostel and spent the day preparing for the trip to Monson, and the Hundred Mile Wilderness to follow.  We continue to move into ever more remote territory.  I am unsure how much I will be able to communicate day by day as I move northward.  Here at the hostel we have wi-fi but no phone service.  Please continue to pray for me as I move northward.  Marlene has sent the final food drop for the trip, to Monson, Maine.  Now I just have to hike forward to pick it up and then move on to Katahdin.  I appreciate your notes in my journal guestbook and the feedback on Facebook, even though I am somewhat unable to respond.  Thanks for going with me on this journey.  Goodnight Sweetheart.","Pierce Pond Lean-To

The hostel in Caratunk was one of the best yet.  If I had known, I could have resupplied there instead of having Marlene send me a package.  So often the guide book says “full resupply” and you wonder how anyone could resupply from that place.  But Caratunk is a great place to do it fully.   We left after our home cooked breakfast and hiked about six miles on fairly nice trail.  Then the climb up Pleasant Pond Mountain began, about 1100 feet but not as difficult as some.  I was at the summit by early lunch time and got a video, and also had phone service, so I sent it to  Marlene.  Very remote the rest of the day so no phone service after that.  The descent from the summit took much of the afternoon.  There were several ponds and nice stream crossings but little else of note.   Much of Maine feels remote and kind of “empty” as far as civilization goes, but that’s nice.   So day one of the three day run to Monson is complete.  Once there, we have to finalize our plans for the 100 Mile Wilderness and then we will be on our way.  Both of my knees are sore but especially the left one.  Hope to baby it along for the remaining climbs especially.  A big one first thing tomorrow morning.   In my tent as darkness falls over the forest.   I can hear Bald Mountain Brook as it tumbles over the rocky bed.  Nice evening sounds.  Goodnight Sweetheart.","Caratunk, Maine

I left early and alone to begin the climb to the summit of Moxie Bald Mountain, over 1300 feet.  It went well.  I was above the clouds on a broad flat summit area covered with huge flat stone slabs.   I got a video but could not get a view over the edge because of the flatness.  While there, a lot of other hikers came in, both northbound and southbound.  When I left I soon came to a ledge over the edge of the summit and got a great view and video out to the valley and a large lake.  No phone service so I have not been able to send anything.  After a long descent the trail flattened out for a ways.  I eventually came to two rivers to ford.  Neither were a problem but the west branch of the Piscataquis was noted as dangerous if there has been rain recently.   It had a rope line strung across to hold onto but I did not need to use it.  After that the trail followed the Piscataquis either on the bank or high above if the canyon was narrow.  Finally got to the shelter for the night and set up my tent to take a nap.  I had not seen Glider since I left camp this morning.  He came in later. After filtering water and having a meal I am in my tent listening to the evening sounds.  Tomorrow we will hike to Monson.  Goodnight Sweetheart","Bald Mountain Brook Lean-To

Today was the final leg of the trip to Monson. It turned out to be fairly uneventful and I put myself on autopilot to just hike the miles and get there.  A fairly level terrain with a few unexpected climbs thrown in to keep me paying attention.  At the parking area beside the road there were a couple of young local men in a pickup who asked me many questions about my hike and offered a ride into town.  When Glider came in we threw our packs and poles and ourselves into the bed of the truck and within a few minutes we were at Shaw’s Hiker Hostel in town.   I received my resupply package from Marlene and have finalized plans for the hike through the Hundred Mile Wilderness, including a food drop about mid way through.  I expect very unreliable phone service but will do the best I can to communicate, even if cryptic messages from some of the high peaks.  Even the service here at the hostel on Monson drops out regularly.  So tomorrow morning the final leg to the base of Katahdin begins.   I will be carrying the heaviest pack of the whole trip when I leave here.

I left Shaw’s in Monson on the shuttle a little after 8 a.m. and was hiking by 8:30, almost two hours later than I like to start.  The first day into the Hundred Mile Wilderness with my pack loaded with five days food - heaviest yet.  The lady at the AT Visitor Center mentioned that hikers underestimate this section.  It showed few climbs but really was loaded with smaller climbs of a few hundred feet all day long.   It made for a long day.   We are stealth camped in the woods along the trail.  We did climb a few ridges and got a panoramic view of this wild and remote region.  Hard to describe but the mountains and forest look so remote and untouched.  The only way to see them is to walk in.  We passed lots of remote ponds and especially beaver ponds.  They are hidden away in the forest. Very beautiful.  There are also many streams, a couple we had to ford but no problem as the levels are fairly low right now.  Nothing much to report and since I am unsure if I will be able to charge my phone again before the hike ends, I must conserve.  Moving ahead in the HMW.

Woke up about 2:30 this morning to hear what sounded like a nice drying wind.  Sure enough the wind blew the rest of the night and had my tent dry when I packed it up.  I was on Chairback Mountain overnight and when I left the descent was about as steep and rocky and technical as any I’ve seen.  The remainder of the day included a long gradual descent to the West Branch of the Pleasant River which I had to ford, followed by a very long and gradual climb to this shelter area. The mileage was not long but seemed to stretch on forever.   I am set up for the night.  I hear thunder rumbling in the distance, moving closer.    Sure enough, a few minutes after 6:30 the rain begins.  I’m praying for another drying wind.  Moving on in the HMW.  Need rest.  Goodnight Sweetheart","Chairback Gap Lean-To

Got my drying wind again and was able to pack up a dry tent.   I left with a series of climbs on my mind.  At the hostel in Monson they said today would be a hard day.  First a 700 foot climb up Gulf Hagas Mountain, followed by a 500 foot climb up West Peak.  More ups and downs between and then about 500 feet up Hay Mountain.  Another drop followed by about 700 feet up White Cap Mountain.   This peak goes above treeline.  On a clear day this summit is where you get your first unmistakable view of Mount Katahdin.  My trip up was over nasty rocks in the rain and visibility of about 20 feet.   It was very cold and windy.   No view of Katahdin today.  I was able to get a text thru with my location to Marlene and we finalized plans for her to send me “civilian” clothes in Millinocket, Maine for my trip home.  How great is that?  I needed to get off the exposed peak for fear of hypothermia so I left quickly.  Also, I am unsure if I will be able to charge my phone before I summit Katahdin, so I’m conserving battery for pictures and videos. The trip down was over slippery rocks but they have done a lot of work to make the path better.  I’m tenting again tonight.   It is very cold again which is alright as I tend to sleep better.   Tomorrow we move close to Jo-Mary Road where we meet a hostel guy with resupply (ATV??) early Saturday morning for the final leg out of the Hundred Mile Wilderness.  All for now.  Goodnight Sweetheart.","Carl A.

What a great day!  I was up and away from camp by around 7:00 on a cold Maine morning.  There were two climbs right away, including Boardman Mountain, but in this section they are small and fairly gradual so I was over them with “ease”.  I passed a couple of nice ponds, one with two older gentlemen fishing.  There were also several beautiful streams with tumbling water.  By lunch time I was at the Cooper Brook Falls Lean-To alone having a sandwich while watching the brook cascading over half a dozen ledges of stone to create background noise in the remote woods.  Two day hikers came by and said there was trail magic about four miles ahead at Jo-Mary road.  That motivated me to hike ahead quickly, though I was unsure what to expect.  Sometimes trail magic can be a chocolate chip cookie.  It turns out most hikers thought the road was a remote woods road suitable for off road vehicles, or even less.  It is a very remote gravel road that you must pay a fee to access.  About a half mile from the road I smelled the unmistakable aroma of grilling burgers.   Dana and Laurie had the best spread we have seen set up and they collected hikers the rest of the day.  It was enough for second lunch for me, plus supper.   A real feast!  Most hikers could not believe having trail magic in the 100 Mile Wilderness and it is indeed very rare.   We are camped here to collect our food resupply tomorrow morning for the remainder of the trip to Abol Bridge.   So the final sections are about to begin.  Really getting excited now.  Goodnight Sweetheart.","East Branch Lean-To

Today was the last full day in the Hundred Mile Wilderness.   I heard the raindrops hitting my tent during the night but I was ready for anything.   I put on my headlamp to get an early start on morning chores.  I have not mentioned it until now to keep anyone from worrying but I have had severe rashes on both hips in the area where my pack’s hip belt comes around the outside.  The first day in the Hundred Mile Wilderness was very hot and humid and I sweat so much all my clothing was soaked through, causing the rash.  I was covering it with duct tape since that is all I had.   Glider had some moleskin tape for blisters but the sores were now raw and running.  I ran out of new duct tape so was using the moleskin tape to hold the old duct tape pieces in place.  My pack was very heavy so I needed to protect the sensitive sores from the painful rub of the belt.   It was looking pretty grim and nasty.  I prayed for help and we met three ladies hiking the HMW on a section hike.  They have camped near us most of the nights in the HMW.  Turns out one is a VA nurse and the other two work at the VA hospital system in administrative positions. They came up with some breathable tape and some antibiotic cream packets.  This helped right away.  All that to say that my morning chores have been very elaborate to try and create a bandage for each side to promote healing and protect the sore area from the weight of the pack and the rubbing, on each side an area about the size of an AT white blaze.   Once everything was ready I got out of the tent and wiped it down with a cloth to remove as much water as I could and quickly packed up wet.  Soon I was on my way on a hike much like the last few days have been.  I did climb to Rainbow Ledges where I had a closer view of Katahdin but the top half shrouded in clouds.  Tomorrow we have a short day to finish the HMW and hope to get showers and clean(er) clothes.  The next morning we hope to have a quick and early hike to the Baxter State Park Boundary where we want to be one of the 12 thru hikers who can sign up to hike 10 miles ahead and camp at The Birches, right at the base of Katahdin, for an early start to the summit on Thursday.   If not one of the 12 we will have to make other arrangements but camping at The Birches is what will work best for us if we can get it.  So that’s the plan.  I noticed that with today’s hike I have now flipped over to the last page in my AWOL Guidebook.  All these things going on and no phone service, so I have not been able to tell Marlene any of it.  Goodnight Sweetheart.","Rainbow Stream Lean-To

Rain again during the night but a drying wind later so my tent was dry.  Quickly packed up and ready to hike.  This short hike was pleasant because I did not need to be anywhere nor go very far.  I just relaxed to enjoy it.   More Maine HMW terrain in a beautiful woods in the still and quiet morning hours.   The woods were often dark like “these woods are lovely, dark,  and deep” but finally ahead I saw a line of light through the tree trunks and knew the end of the Hundred Mile Wilderness was coming.   Sure enough, I came to a smooth, pine needle covered path and the warning sign for those entering the wilderness with the same somber message as 100 miles south of here.  A little further ahead into the light and around the corner I step out onto gravel Golden Road and ahead I see Abol Bridge.  I am officially out of the Hundred Mile Wilderness.  I so wanted to text Marlene that I was out of there but no phone service, maybe none until I get down from the mountain and into town.  I pause to take a video of crossing the bridge and half way over I glance to my left and see the sparklingly clear Katahdin standing like a massive behemoth so close it feels like I could reach out to touch it.  The emotion of finally coming out of the wilderness and then seeing the mountain, my goal for all these miles, was overwhelming.   Not seeing the mountain itself, but the impact of the end being so near.  I cried.  My mind races to specific places, events, people and scenes from this journey.  It all adds up to being here now and ready for the final miles.  What a great feeling.  Glider comes in to the camp store at Abol Bridge and we make arrangements for tonight - their bunk house.  We shower (impossible to describe after 9 days in the wilderness) and do laundry.   A little resupply done for the 11 miles to the campsite at the base of Katahdin for tomorrow, and then some for summit day on Thursday.   A burger and fries for lunch and we’ll be back tonight for evening meal.  I wonder if I’ll sleep tonight.  Even more unsure about tomorrow night.  The mountain and the end of this journey are right there for the taking.  There were so many times when I wondered if I could ever get here.  Now to do it.  I hope I finish well.  Goodnight Sweetheart.","Hurd Brook Lean-To

Earliest start ever.  We were both awake at 4:30 and began to pack for the day while it was still dark.  When ready we headed out by headlamp.   About a mile ahead a kiosk has a sign-up sheet for up to 12 hikers to enter Baxter State Park and have a place to stay at The Birches for tonight and an early start to the summit Thursday morning.   At the park boundary we found tents in the woods, for hikers apparently hoping to be in line early to sign up for the spaces.  They were still asleep and we tip toed by in the dark.  The sign up sheet was supposed to be put out around 7 or even 8, we were told in Monson, but when we got there it was already available, and empty.  I was first and Glider was second to sign in.   Since that chore was done and we were accommodated we sat down right there to have breakfast from our pack supplies.  Then began our 10 mile hike for the day.  It was mostly easy trail thru the woods, with a few rocky and rooty sections and some small mountains to climb. We crossed several streams and saw more Maine ponds. Nesowadnehunk Stream had a rocky stream bed with fast flowing water tumbling thru narrow places. Two of these are called Big Niagara Falls and Little Niagara Falls.  The woods and the hills prevented seeing Katahdin until we were very close.  It’s too big of a mountain to hide though, so eventually we got glimpses and can now see fairly clearly the task for tomorrow’s summit day.  I am taking a smaller pack to the summit - borrowed from the Rangers.   So I am spending this afternoon selecting what to bring and getting that arranged.   Likely we will get an early start in the morning but maybe not as early as today.  I checked as I was hiking along today and saw the miles remaining tick down to single digits.   So the end is near.   The weather gives us some concern as tomorrow shows some likelihood of clouds and rain.  We will just take it as it comes.  Still no phone service.  I so wish I could communicate with Marlene as the final days of this hike wind down.  It may be available at the summit tomorrow so I can at least tell her when I make it there.  The miles tomorrow have to be hiked twice.   It is over a 4000 foot climb over boulders followed by an above tree line boulder field of over a mile called The Tablelands, then to the iconic sign at the end.  Then turn around and retrace the way back down the mountain to the Ranger station.  A very full day.  I will be so glad to get to Millinocket and call Marlene to tell her I am done.  Goodnight Sweetheart.","Abol Bridge - Out of the Hundred Mile Wilderness

Hikers at The Birches talked nervously the night before summit day.  There was excitement and anticipation, knowing Katahdin is a serious climb.  No one has heard of a hiker failing to complete a thru hike because they could not make the final summit, but there is a sense of the difficulty while there is also the desire to just get going.   In the very wee hours of the morning I knew Dr Who in the other shelter had his headlamp out and was getting ready to start out in the dark.  At 4:30 I began to do a few chores by feel only.  Then a sixth sense told me Glider was laying over there still in his sleeping bag but awake. I whispered “Glider, are you awake?” and he said yes and we both began to move about freely, getting ready.   Our big packs were staying at the ranger station and we had separated gear the night before as best we could into our day packs.  After final prep, including breakfast, we hoisted our backpacks onto our backs and carried our day packs in our hands the quarter mile down to the ranger station, by headlamp.  The first mile was winding through the Katahdin Stream Campground and then into the woods, quickly starting to gain elevation, but in a more normal climb like on any big peak. Soon we hit the beginning of the two mile boulder scramble.  Huge rocks straight up where we would wonder how to get a hand or foothold to get up to the next boulder above.   Hard work with no letup.  On such a steep ascent you can see out to the surrounding mountains because you are on near cliff-like structures, though still surrounded by the forest.  So we knew we were making progress because these towering peaks were at our level as we slowly crawled up the side.  It seems that the only mountain you can’t see is the one you are on.  It’s hard to see where you are in the ascent of a peak or how close the actual summit is because false summits and false shoulders hide each other, going ever higher and out of sight.   Then we finally came above treeline and could see the stacked tower of boulders ahead, one tower at a time.   Naked boulders steeply up a rugged incline, hiding the next one until nearly ready to crest the top. Then the next one, looking just like the last one, comes into view.   I was ahead and could look back to see Glider working his way along the stack behind and below me, looking small.  Finally I saw a sign in silhouette against the murky sky ahead and anticipated it would level off at the next crest - The Tablelands.   By this time I had been in the clouds and out into a short clearing dozens of times.  The wind was wild and strong enough to blow me off my feet sideways.  My cap was in my pack for fear of losing it in the gusts.  I would be socked in or get a view out and down as the clouds whipped by.  The clouds were in multiple layers, giving beautiful views to the lower elevations of Katahdin, and to the surrounding mountains, and sometimes all the way to the valley floor.   At The Tablelands sign I waited for Glider and got a few pictures and a video.  The wind was fierce and cold.   I even pulled out my jacket against the exposure, thinking hypothermia a possibility.   Glider came up and soon we moved ahead.  The Tablelands is where the ascent levels off some.  Think rock fields, but also think moonscape.   For a long way the ascent is gradual, hopping from rock to rock.   After a mile we met Dr Who, already returning from the summit.  He was upbeat.  He was excited and somewhat of a chatterbox.  We talked about his summit story, shouting over the wind.  We still had to gain about 700 feet elevation and there was a mini-version of the shoulders hiding each other from view as we continued to hop rock to rock but very steeply now by comparison.  Then I saw the sideways view of the iconic summit sign so I knew we were getting there.   A tenth of a mile remaining, then 100 yards, then a few feet.  Then I slapped my right hand against the cold weathered wood of the summit sign.   From Georgia to Maine, I’m here!  Tears welled up.  Momentary confusion.   I’m here, but you’re supposed to do something.  Yes, get pictures.  Look around.  Try to take it all in.   Try to memorize the way it looks, the way it feels.   I got a cryptic message out to Marlene so she would know.  Other hikers came in. Congratulations all around.  The landscape continued to clear and then cloud over.  The wind continued to whip around.   It did not seem cold.  I took off my jacket.   We got pictures, everyone trading camera duties.  I fought back tears. The hike was over.  Think about all that has happened.  Think about that other summit down in Georgia.  The events between are too many to count.  Yes, I still had to hike back down but that was mere formality.   We stayed about 30 minutes.   Then you look around, then just walk away.  It starts to be a memory right then.  We came up the Hunt Trail, where the AT white blazes are found.   Retracing about a mile, we picked up the blue blazed Abol Trail, going down another way to the Abol Campground, rather than repeating the Hunt Trail. (We thought it might be a little easier, but not so much).   It was steeper but the steep part was shorter, or so we thought.   Hard to tell really.   Look at a picture of Katahdin and you see from a distance a long white gash going right down the center of the front side of the mountain.  That is from a rockslide long ago.  The Abol Trail goes over a steep cliff face above for a long way, and then right down the center of that gash.  In total it is longer than the Hunt Trail.   Very steep almost all the way down until the valley floor forces it to level off.  Our knees took a real beating on the pounding jamming descent.   Finally a more normal woods walk for awhile and down into the Abol Campground.  After that a quick two mile walk on a gravel road with tall trees straight up and close in on either side, back to Katahdin Stream Campground and the ranger station.  Then it’s over.   On the shuttle ride out of Baxter State Park and into Millinocket, Katahdin came into view several times.   Now it’s sort of personal.  I’ve been there.  It’s a memory and slowly the details fade.     But I’ve been there.  I wink at the mountain, and we both know.   Goodnight Sweetheart.","The Birches Lean-Tos and Campsite

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605665,"It's been several months since I completed my hike to Katahdin.  I am recovering well from the aches and pains and have continued to enjoy hearing from folks who followed my trip and also just remembering the time.  Near the end of August I was in Monson, Maine preparing to enter the Hundred Mile Wilderness when I was interviewed by Steve Adams, also known as ""Mighty Blue"", for an episode on his weekly hiking podcast ""Mighty Blue on the Appalachian Trail"".  The interview was published on this week's episode of the podcast.  In it Steve asked me about my 2017 hike and the continuation of my hike this year to finish up on Katahdin.  I think he does a great job of interviewing, both gathering the information and editing the information into an enjoyable story.  If you are interested, I have tried to post a link below to the podcast.  Also, you can google ""Mighty Blue on the Appalachian Trail"" and then select Episode #121.  I hope you enjoy it.  Steve likes feedback on his podcast offerings so if you could, please take the time to write a review on his site.  Thanks.  CBiscuit
