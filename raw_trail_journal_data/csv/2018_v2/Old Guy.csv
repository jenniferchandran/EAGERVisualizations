Old Guy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583935,"When I decided to name my little journal AT follies it was really meant as humor. Seems like it may be totally spot on!Started out around 0800 this morning from the road access about a mile north of the trail south end. Having done the one mile that is south of this road yesterday. I know. Silly. Can't claim the whole thing without doing that one mile!A few other people joined us for the start. Think there were 7 total. Some folks are from NC and all are experienced hikers. That said, I was left behind in short order! No problem for me, I love looking at the surrounding.A fairly short time later, at about mile 2.71 came across a large creek that had a log across it named ""footbridge stream"". Well, i looked at the log, then the creek. The creek had lots of large rocks and could have been easily crossed.Then I decided, you well may have many log crossings, what can go wrong. My shoe's were a little muddy but they should be good. Well, about the 4th step they were not providing much traction. Started loosing my balance and gyrating like a really good stripper. Had no idea I had all those wiggles in me. Probably around the 15th jerk,rotation, wiggles I left the log. It was only about 5 feet to the stream.Had no idea how much velocity could be reached on that short of distance! Landed on my back in the same spot that screamed when I left the log!Then, one of my water bottles jumped out, I could have been evenly matched with a bear chasing a salmon in Alaska! Got the bottle. I could hardly get out of the creek!!Totally jacked up my back. Will see if the world is spinning in the morning.","

Living large!I went to the ER this morning. Lucky enough to get a Doctor that has seen enough to get me what I wanted! Drugs! (Guess that's why many people go to the ER) I'm feeling better already. Says I have some bruising! Like I didn't know?Will most likely stay here for the bed for two nights. After that, all bets are off!!","

Old Guy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584308,"Certainly did not expect to end this one so soon. Â Seemingly just a few years ago when I was still doing some long-distance running I had problems with muscle spasms in my lower back. I sought counsel and examination by two highly acclaimed back surgeons in the Dallas area. Both told me that I did not require surgery and the only way I could solve the issues was to simply stop running long-distance. As expected I didn't listen, when Audrey told me, I listened.No doubt my exit from a log into a river exasperated previous damage to my lower back. I have been abusing the drugs that the ER doc prescribed for me to an embarrassing extent. In some circles drug abuse is normal, not mine. I hope to need my liver and kidneys for several years to come.I am speculating that someone brisk walking with a somewhat heavy pack may replicate the same pressure as running. The symptoms that I am experiencing, of muscle spasms, really sharp stabbing twitching etc. are exactly what I was experiencing at that time.I have always wanted to hike this trail. What time I have had and the beautiful surroundings that I have seen makes me want to scream ""get outside!""Life is so very good when you are married to the person that is meant for you.If you have been looking at this I am in your debt.","
