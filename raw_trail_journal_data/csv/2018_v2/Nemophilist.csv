Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591377,"So last year I hiked 1208 miles on the Appalachian Trail, basically between Fontana Dam, NC and Bellevale, NY. In the fall of 2016 I hiked the 120+/- miles from Amicalola Falls State Park, GA to Winding Stair Gap near Franklin, NC, so I have a small 57 mile gap to fill in before I head to New England at the end of June to complete the northern end of the trail. I ended the hiking season last fall with a bit of a cold and decided to go home early. It turned out to be a good decision because the cold turned into a doozy plus I was just worn out. I thought I might go back last year to finish this short section but if truth be told, I just don't enjoy cold weather camping that much and once I got settled in at home wasn't eager to return. I did miss my new hiking friends, Mudsmeller and Cutie Handful and followed the rest of their journey online as they successfully hiked to Springer Mountain. This year, my 81 year old Mum, Frolicking Dinosaur, said she would like to hike this section with me, so that is the plan. Obviously we will hike slowly and take lots of breaks. Frolicking Dinosaur is in excellent health and walks 4 miles everyday with her dog so we will slowly make our way from Fontana Dam to Winding Stair Gap.",,View Entry,"May 12, Sat",0
Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591378,"The idea was to drive Frolicking Dinosaur's car to Gooder Grove Adventure Hostel in Franklin, then have the owner, Zen, shuttle us to Fontana Dam where we would stay at the Lodge overnight and start hiking tomorrow morning southbound back towards her car. I texted Zen when we were getting close but got no reply so we just went ahead and drove to the hostel only to find out that Zen had evidently forgot about our appointment and had shuttled some hikers over to the Atlanta Airport. I have to give it to him though, he stepped up to the plate and promptly found us another shuttle driver though the price was now $20 more than he had quoted me, supposedly because of higher gas prices. We didn't feel like we had much choice so just went with the flow. Our new shuttle driver, Jim, was at first a bit gruff but then turned out to be a real sweetheart. He offered us fruit and bottled water and offered multiple times to stop for bathroom breaks at gas stations. He took us on a gravel road shortcut that was very scenic and filled us in on the history of the area. I think he took a shine to Frolicking Dinosaur because he gave her a hug and a kiss when he delivered us to our destination. Please note that I didn't even get a handshake! We were soon in a nice room at the Lodge and enjoying a pleasant meal at the Grill. We walked down to the General Store for an ice cream but unfortunately it had closed already. Both Frolicking Dinosaur and I enjoy Masterpiece Theater on PBS so spent the evening watching the telly.",,View Entry,"May 13, Sun",0
Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591380,Last nights stay at the Fontana Lodge was pleasant enough though breakfast service a bit slow this morning but delicious none the less. We had to wait until 9:15 for the shuttle to the trailhead which made for a late start. The major event today was a 5 mile uphill walk with brutal heat and humidity. I had regained my trail legs on the Foothills Trail last month but Frolicking Dinosaur struggled with the rigorous climb and heat. We just took it slowly and enjoyed frequent breaks. I shouldered a bit of her weight in my pack and 2 miles short of our destination left her slowly walking and sped up to our destination and started setting up camp. There was thunder in the distance toward the end of the day but fortunately it stayed away from us. There was a nice group of people at the Shelter and we socialized while preparing dinner. We were in our tents by 9pm though lying on top of our sleeping bags because it was still so hot!,"Fontana Dam

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591381,"It was still quite humid today but overcast so not quite as hot. The terrain wasn't quite as rigorous as yesterdays climb but still typical AT tough. One of the highlights today was seeing a couple of thru hikers with not only their dog in tow, but their cat too. Evidently the cat had been hiking on a leash but it's paw pads had become really sore and it was now being carried in a sling by it's Mom. So cute, though I imagine hiking with pets makes a hike much more complicated. We saw lots of wildflowers including a few new ones for me. Our plan was to hike to Stecoah Gap and stay at the Wolfcreek Hostel that I had heard good things about. We called from Brown Fork Gap Shelter only to find out that they were unable to take guests tonight because of a family medical emergency. I called the other hostel, Cabin in the Woods and they were full, so we decided to stay put at the shelter. We went back and forth on whether to stay in the shelter or put our tent up and ended up making the right decision of staying in the shelter since it rained a good bit through the night. Our shelter mates were 2 guys new to backpacking and a thruhiker from Missouri. The thruhiker told me he would be glad to get out of hiking in the mountains and into some rolling hills. I didn't have the heart to tell him that would be about 2000 miles from here when he went home. He also confidently assured us that he didn't snore but dang if he didn't saw logs all night long!","Cable Gap Shelter

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591382,"It was misting rain on our 2 mile walk down to Stecoah Gap, but not enough to put on a raincoat. It actually felt pretty good! We got to Locust Grove Gap about mid afternoon and it was a pretty campsite. I thought Frolicking Dinosaur would be done for the day but she seemed to have got her trail legs and was game for the climb up to Cheoah Bald. Usually I walk ahead and then wait for her to catch up but it seemed she was always just a short ways behind me today. As we climbed, the trail became quite rocky and there were some neat looking caves, though we didn't investigate. The last mile was really tough and I did pull away from Frolicking Dinosaur and waited for her at the Bartram Trail Junction. It was only another .2 mile to the bald but we decided to camp at a pleasant little spot just off the Bartram Trail. We had carried our water from the Gap since we would be dry camping tonight. Mr N sent me a video of the stream on our property that had become a raging river after they had received more than 5 inches of rain over the last 24 hours back home. Luckily we haven't run into that kind of weather although we are only 60 miles west of home. There was a lot of racket from a hooting owl and another screeching bird that made it hard for me to fall asleep though eventually exhaustion finally won out and I did.","Cable Gap Shelter

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591383,"We decided to pack up, eat a granola bar then walk the 1.4 miles to the next shelter to eat our full breakfast. Frolicking Dinosaur had me rolling on the ground with laughter when she commented that she hit a bullseye on her cat hole this morning. Humor that only a backpacker can appreciate! As we started walking Frolicking Dinosaur complained of feeling nauseous and started dry heaving. She also complained of a headache. We stopped at Sassafras Gap Shelter and she said she felt better after eating breakfast. We had a short climb up Swim Bald then it was all down hill to the Nantahala Outdoor Center where we had a room booked for the night. We had some great views today from Cheoah Bald and down into the Nantahala Gorge. Frolicking Dinosaur still didn't feel well as we made our way off the mountain. We looked forward to stopping at the Wade Sutton Memorial since Sutton is also our last name, my maiden name. Unfortunately, Wade Sutton lost his life fighting a forest fire here in 1968! We made it down to NOC by 3 and were soon feeling refreshed after a shower and laundry though Frolicking Dinosaur discovered a developing blister on her foot. We went out to dinner at the restaurant and I enjoyed my favorite hiking meal, cheeseburger, fries and a beer plus I ate some of Frolicking Dinosaurs salad. Frolicking Dinosaur said she just didn't feel well enough to continue on and we had to decide on a plan on how to get her back to her car. We called Mr Nemophilist and asked him if he would mind driving here to pick up Frolicking Dinosaur in my 15 year old SUV, they would then drive to Franklin to pick up Frolicking Dinosaurs car then go leave my old jalopy at the Winding Stair Gap trail head. He agreed, so that was the plan for the next morning.","Bartram Trail Junction

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591384,"Since I was heading off alone I wasn't keen on carrying the weight of our 2 person tent so I decided to just carry the rainfly and the ground sheet and plan on trying to stay in shelters. Frolicking Dinosaur and I returned to the restaurant for a full breakfast for me to power my hike. Our waiter was a really pleasant young man and upon learning of Frolicking Dinosaurs tummy problems kindly shared some of his own personal yogurt hoping the probiotics might give her some relief. By 8:45 I was back on the trail and heading up the steep climb to Wesser Bald. Great views again today! I stopped at the Wesser Bald Shelter which had been the planned camping stop for Frolicking Dinosaur and I, but since it was early just stayed for lunch. I felt strong today so powered on to Cold Spring Shelter which turned out to be a very tiny shelter built in the 1930's. Four people were already there and I asked if there was room for me. They sort of hemmed and hawed so I pointed out that it was a shelter for 6 people and let them know I intended to stay. They had there stuff all over the shelter floor so I just started unpacking my stuff and sort of pushed my way in. Last year I would never have done this, probably would have just gone and camped by myself. It feels good to have gained that confidence. They turned out to be pleasant enough shelter mates. Salty and Stogie were 2 young college guys, Pi was a young German woman also in college and Grandpa Rick was probably nearer my age. He seemed a bit ill prepared for backpacking, carrying cans of Dinty Moore Stew, a thermos, and wearing jeans and a sweatshirt. None the less we had good conversations over dinner, then Grandpa pulled out his little pipe and fragrant smoking material and continued to puff away until Hiker Midnight. I was concerned that no one but I hung their food bags but figured I'd probably been pushy enough just inserting myself into the shelter and decided not to lecture on bear bagging. I did learn that my old friend, No Rush, who I had camped with last year is back on the trail. He is becoming a trail legend with this slow hiking philosophy and hourly coffee brewing. I'd love to see him again.","Nantahala Outdoor Center

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591385,"I was glad I was under roof as it did rain most of the night. This shelter did have a lot of mice though none walked over me but they did get into Pi's pack and shredded her toilet paper. The young people were off early though I was disappointed to see that some trash had been left in the fire pit. My pet peeve and really hard to understand why people do that! After breakfast and as I headed out, Grandpa was loading his pipe again. Geez, I don't know how a person hikes in such a laid back condition, though maybe it helps with the pain of carrying all those cans of stew. I stopped at Wayah Bald Shelter for a snack and met a young woman from Florida called Seaweed. She had all her gear hung to dry out since she had got really wet last night. After a few minutes of conversation she sheepishly asked if I might have some extra toilet paper since hers was wet. I was thinking that I might go all the way to Winding Stair Gap today, so let her have my roll except for a small emergency supply for myself. Next up was the Wayah Bald stone tower. I have been here before when we had a family car camping trip to Standing Indian Basin probably about 10 years ago. The roof had burned on the tower in the forest fires 2 years ago but was recently replaced. The fires started a week after I completed my Georgia AT hike that year. The view is fantastic! It wasn't long before I approached Siler Bald and the Siler Bald Shelter. It was only 3pm and I had 4 downhill miles to get to my car so I decided to go for it. I was pretty tired but so happy to be finishing this section. As I approached Hwy 64 there was a couple and their dog heading towards me. Evidently the dog caught a mole and they were applauding and saying good job. I joked with them that I thought they were congratulating me upon my finishing hiking Springer Mountain to Bellvale NY. It was a funny moment and so they did give me a round of applause. I had a quick bandana wipe down and got in my car and headed down into Franklin to the Lazy Hiker Brewing Co for a couple of celebratory beers and a delicious Korean BBQ sandwhich. I think I'm ready for Mount Katahdin! Stay tuned!","Cold Spring Shelter

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600493,"There have been many twists and turns with my attempt to get back on the trail and complete my hike. My intention was to return at the end of June and I had all the logistics planned out and airfare purchased when one of my eyeballs decided that it wasn’t time yet. A week before I was to leave I experienced a weird spider web floater in my left eye. It was only there for about 20 minutes then disappeared though I continued to experience an extremely small bug like floater and cloudiness in my vision. I stopped into my optometrist office to have him check it out and within the hour I was on my way to the hospital to have emergency surgery to repair 2 tears in my retina. It was all very random and sudden and quite scary. Evidently you can go blind if the retina detaches I was told. I had a gas bubble inserted into my eyeball that held the retina in place while it healed though prohibited me from flying for a month. Needless to say I’m glad it happened before I started hiking though it delayed my start by 6 weeks.
I had decided to complete the AT by hiking from the northern terminus in Maine to Belleville NY where I had stopped in my initial northern journey last year. So today I had a tough travel day of flights with 2 connections, my very first Uber ride, an hour long bus ride, then a shuttle ride to Millinocket, Maine. I made it to the Appalachian Trail Lodge where I will spend 2 nights before I start my hike on Friday. Most of the other guests here are early north bounders who are finishing up their hike and a few flip-floppers.","

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600494,"The first thing I noticed here is that it gets light really early. I thought I had slept in but when I glanced at my watch it was a little after 5am and it was already light out. I guess that will be great for getting an early start on the trail. I tried to snooze a little longer but finally got up and walked down the street to the affiliated AT Cafe for my complimentary breakfast which was supposed to be eggs, bacon, sausage and pancakes. Since I don’t have hiker hunger yet I asked if I could just substitute some eggs and toast which they obliged. I spent the day organizing my food and filling my food drop bucket. This entailed a mile walk to the grocery store for some of the extras I didn’t bring with me. The Lodge offers a great service of giving you a bucket that you fill with food and they deliver to a prearranged location about halfway through the 100 mile wilderness which will be the first part of the hike.  This is the longest stretch of the AT without any resupply options. I decided it was well worth the $35 to have a lighter pack. It got really hot in the afternoon and there wasn’t any air conditioning at the Hostel plus the WiFi sucked. I decided to walk over to the public library where it was nice and cool plus the WiFi was excellent. I sat in a comfy chair and read some newspapers and magazines while downloading some Netflix shows to my phone to watch later. There was also a great book on the wildflowers of Baxter State Park which is where I’m headed tomorrow. I had really been anticipating a lobster roll and had one  for dinner. It was ok, not spectacular.","

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600495,"Ole Man, the proprietor of the AT Lodge, rounded up the 6 of us who were summiting Baxter Peak on Mount Katahdin today for the 6:30 shuttle bus ride to Baxter State Park. He filled the 40 minute ride with lots of information about the hike up Baxter Peak and the 100 mile wilderness. He said that he had some music to play for us and loaded the CD player with the theme song from Rocky. Hilarious and appropriate! I checked in at the ranger station, got my loaner daypack and was soon on my way. The first mile was fairly easy and I started to wonder what all the hoopla was about. It soon became very apparent as the trail started to climb and the boulders got bigger and bigger. Before long the hike became a rock climb where you constantly had to plan where to put your hands and feet to get a handhold up. I had to use my upper body strength to pull myself up which it turns out is definitely not one of my super strengths. At one point there were metal hand holds to grab on to pull yourself up.To top it all off although it had been clear at the beginning of the hike, a foggy mist rolled in and I started having trouble seeing the best path to take upward. At one point I thought I was almost there when Dad and son dayhikers passed me and told me that no it was a false summit with a short saddle before continuing onward and upward. I started feeling panicky and seriously wondered if I was going to be able to do this. I sat down for a couple of minutes and tried to calm myself down then slowly continued on. Some of the other hikers from the shuttle bus this morning were already starting their descent after reaching the summit. I then met a couple of hikers that encouraged me on and told me I was almost there. I eventually reached the Tablelands which is the beginning of the alpine environment and back to more traditional hiking though I still had 1.6 miles to go. Suddenly the fog cleared and it was just beautiful. There was quite a crowd at the summit and  someone volunteered to take my iconic Mt Katahdin photo at the sign! I sat and ate some lunch and took in the magnificent views though  didn’t linger since it was really windy and I was a little worried on descending that 2 mile rock climbing section. It turned out to be not as bad as I had imagined since the fog had cleared and it was easier to see the route to take. There was a lot of scooting on my bum for sure. I was really tired and seemed to get slower and slower but kept plugging along. I finally made it back Katahdin Stream Campground after 11 1/2 hours and hobbled over to the Lean-to I had reserved. I knew climbing Katahdin was going to be tough  but it was way harder than I imagined but I felt proud of my accomplishment. I guess I was the last one down since my backpack was the only one left at the Ranger Station. I had agreed to share my Lean-to with an Australian lad called All Good since he hadn’t been able to secure a reservation. He had gotten a nice welcoming fire going. I wasn’t hungry so basically swallowed down a couple of Aleve, crawled in my sleeping bag and called it a day, though definitely one for the memory books. (Note: today’s mileage was actually 10.4 miles  since you have to climb up to get back down)","Baxter Peak on Mt Katahdin

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600496,I was so sore and tired last night that I considered going back to Millinocket to recover before continuing south. Also what I  failed to tell you yesterday is that the crown that fell off last year on my hike came off again when I was eating my lunch. So I thought about going back to town to have it cemented back on. When I woke up it was misting rain but I felt somewhat recovered. The post that had held my crown felt fine and I remembered the dentist last year saying it wasn’t an emergency or anything. I really wanted to make some forward progress so packed up and started hiking. All Good bid me an Aussie “see ya mate” and took off. The 10 mile hike out of Baxter State Park was beautiful despite the soggy day. This is definitely a place that would be worthwhile to come back and explore further. The trail went past several lakes or what they call ponds here. I stopped to see both Little Niagara Falls and Big Niagara Falls which we’re running quite well with the rain. There was a rock hop across Nesowadnehunk Stream and I watched 3 young guys struggle a bit on the slippery rocks so decided to take the high water bypass trail that Ole Man had recommended yesterday. Just before exiting Baxter State Park I met another sobo hiker called Seeker. We ended up at the Abol Bridge Campground at the same time and decided to share the last available  campsite. We ate a pleasant dinner at the adjacent restaurant with Archer who was finishing up a multi year section hike at Mt Katahdin in a day or two.

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600497,"Still feeling really sore but figure hiking is going to loosen up the knots in my muscles. I noticed right off that the trail is much more rugged than the parts of the trail I have hiked in the south. To say it is very rooty, rocky, and muddy is actually an understatement but there is a wonderful scent in the air from all the conifers. I stopped at Hurd Brook Lean-to for a snack and met a young women, Money Penny, who was turning around. She was carrying a huge hoop tent under one arm and a bed roll under the other.  She told me she also had a Mac computer in her pack. Not surprisingly she had just fell into the brook. She was still very upbeat and laughing about her predicament. It was then up to Rainbow Ledges for a great view of Katahdin. I stopped for lunch and met Joel who was out for a section hike of the 100 Mile Wilderness. He seemed a tad unprepared too, in his blue jeans and carrying a huge pack. The trail dropped down to Rainbow Lake which was just stunning! I heard the eerie call of the loons for the first time. I soon made it to the campsite which was quite crowded with a group of AT trail maintainers. Seeker was already there and had saved me a space for my tent. I went to the shoreline for a wash up and was tempted to go for a swim except the many leeches creeped me out. Joel also limped into camp too. a little worse for wear. The sunset was beautiful from the shore at the lake.","Abol Bridge Campground

I was last one out of camp since I enjoyed a leisurely breakfast and coffee and if truth be known am still feeling the effects of climbing Katahdin. The morning was pretty level walking although still an abundance of roots and rocks. I stopped and filled up with water and chatted with some of the other hikers at Rainbow Stream lean-to. There was a woman there who I would see a little later on who was carrying a huge pack. When I saw her later she was unpacking some of her gear and carrying it down some steps and then going back up to get her pack. I swear she was carrying a woman’s handbag! She told me she had just had a tooth pulled too and thankfully was thinking of turning around. I’m not really sure what to say when I meet hikers who obviously haven’t done their homework. I would hate to see anyone hurt but don’t want to excessively interfere. I just said maybe it would be a good idea to turn back and left it at that. Next up was  Nesuntabunt Mountain to climb where I found Joel. He was limping badly and told me he had injured his knee. Curiously enough I turned on my phone and had a signal. A message popped up from my friend Mudsmeller who you may remember I hiked with last year with her partner Cutie Handful.  She told me they are off trail because she has injured her knee. I know they must be disappointed. They have had an amazing hike! I was hoping to cross paths with them again because I so enjoyed their company last year. Such is the way of the trail. She is a hard taskmaster! Mudsmeller told me to keep an eye out for the Crawford Family. They are parents and I think 6 kids who have hiked from Georgia. They are somewhat trail celebrities with a YouTube vlog. It wasn’t long after that I saw a teenage boy hopping along the trail with a baby on his back both cheerily yelling hello to me. Few minutes later a young girl then another, I realized they were the Crawford’s and stopped to congratulate the parents. It wasn’t until later that I realized they weren’t wearing backpacks but later found out that a trail angel called Fresh Ground was slackpacking them through the 100 mile wilderness. I reached a nice beach area and set up camp. Just before dark I was surprised to see Joel limp in. He told me he was stubborn but realized he’d bitten off more than he could chew. He told me he was going to stay put tomorrow then make his way to the next road crossing and hope for a ride back to Millinocket. I gave him 4 Aleve since he wasn’t carrying anything for pain relief.","Rainbow Lake Campground

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600500,"I had set my alarm because I’d read there was a great sunrise over the lake. Unfortunately I didn’t hear it and missed it. I noticed Joel was gone so figured the Aleve must have allowed him to move on. I met a young couple camping at a campsite on the south end of Nahmakanta Lake. They had been hiking with their dog who had suffered some cuts on his paws. They decided to stay put and enjoy the beautiful spot until they were to be picked up in a few days. They asked if I’d like any hiking snacks that they no longer needed. Of course I said yes to this awesome trail magic. It was a few more miles to a campsite and new Shelter on the Nahmakanta Stream and there was Joel with his tent set up. He said he was going to just keep inching forward a few miles every day. I ate lunch by the Stream and cleaned up a little. It has been so hot and humid that I’m just constantly soaked in sweat. The weather is like what I’d expect back home and evidently very unusual for here. I was approaching an opportunity to go into the only Hostel in the wilderness, White House Landing, and kept debating whether to go or not. I decided to make a spot decision when I came to the side trail that would take me there. Shortly after,  a thunderstorm passed overhead and I figured it must be a sign. I walked the 1/4 mile to a dock where you call the Hostel and they come over in a motor boat from over a mile away to take you to the Hostel. Bill, the owner, told me he had just seen a Moose and perhaps we might see it on the ride back. Sure enough a bull moose with full set of antlers was feeding at waters edge. It was a real treat to see my first moose and I knew I’d made the right decision to come here. The property was once an old logging camp and now serves as an off the grid fishing camp and hiker Hostel. It was beautiful and very peaceful. I upgraded to stay in Shore Cottage the only remaining building from the logging camp days. I shared the cottage with hikers, Do Right, Sea Goat, and Tinkerbell. We had our own bedrooms but shared the living space. There was a small beach for swimming and kayaks and canoes available if you wished. Being off grid there was a wash tub and washboard for cleaning our clothes and of course a clothesline. I noticed the owners cabin had solar panels and a windmill. I had an enormous delicious homemade pizza for dinner at the Lodge. It was too much to eat so decided I’d have some for breakfast and they would pack the rest for me to take with me tomorrow. Pleasant conversations were enjoyed and as it went dark everyone turned in for the night. I slept great!","Sand Beach Campsite on Nahmakanta Lake

After breakfast Bill loaded us hikers and backpacks into the boat and whisked us back to the dock to continue our hikes. I was the only one heading south so bid farewell to my new friends. It was another hot and muggy day and a little over 4 miles into my hike I came across a sign pointing to a trail to a sandy beach so I took it. No leeches in sight so I stripped down to my undies and took a swim. It felt so refreshing and wonderful. I felt great today. My muscles had finally started to relax and my trail legs felt like they were kicking in. I stopped at Antlers Campsite for lunch where a group of teenage boys from a nearby camp were on an overnighter. I had thought of stopping at some campsites near Jo Mary Rd but a young woman encouraged me to go a few more miles to Cooper Brook Falls because it was such a beautiful spot. I ended up doing my most mileage yet and arrived about 5:30. There were limited camping spots so I asked a guy hammocking if he minded if I set up on level spot near him. A little later a young couple came and set up right next to me and turned out to be quite annoying. They chit chatted and giggled on and on way past hiker midnight  and then progressed to a little noodling. Nothing wrong with that and I’m all for a little romance unless it’s 5 feet away from me  with only silnylon separating us. Pillow talk lasted well beyond real midnight when it started raining and thankfully muffled some of the sound. I hope I snored really loudly when I eventually fell asleep.","White House Landing

I was given specific instructions that led me to a spot behind a big boulder where buckets were stashed under a tarp. I enjoyed a Frappuccino that I had cached in my bucket and spent several minutes rearranging my food bag. I was able to leave my accumulated trash in the bucket for disposal. Of course my pack felt so heavy now with all the food that will carry me to Monson but thankfully the caffeinated sugary drink helped power me up Boardman Mountain. The terrain has been fairly flat so far but is starting to get more mountainous. I passed Mountain View Pond and glanced along the shoreline hoping to see another moose, and sure enough there was a female at waters edge. She was really hard to see except I kept seeing her head move. I got to East Branch Lean-to at 2 and because I was feeling cranky plus my shoulder was hurting decided to take a short day. I found a nice secluded tent spot and the sun finally came out and the humidity dropped. I strung a clothesline and finally got all my clothes and tent dry.

Finally the heatwave and accompanying high humidity had broke and it felt wonderful! There was a good breeze  blowing too that kept all the pesky mosquitoes at bay. It was a good climb up White Cap Mountain but the Maine Appalachian Trail Club had installed an incredible number of rock steps which made the hard climb a little easier. Near the top was a fantastic view of the wilderness with Katahdin in the far distance with of course the clouds covering the peak. It was amazing to see how far I’ve come in the last week. The peak of White Cap was covered in rocks and shale and I found the perfect rock that I could lean back with my pack on and felt like I was sitting in an easy chair. The view was breathtaking and I sat there for sometime taking it all in and being thankful for being able to take this journey. There were three more mountains to traverse, Hay, West Peak, and finally Gulf Hagas. They were all challenging but not as difficult as White Cap. When I got to Carl Newall Lean-to there were few suitable tent sites so I crossed the stream and found the perfect spot in what must have once been a logging camp since there were old rusty tools scattered around.

The trail was an easy walk in the woods and this nemophilist was a happy hiker. I heard someone approaching from behind and turned to find All Good and another hiker. I had figured he would be in Monson by now but he told me he had met up with some guys, gone back to town and drunk too many beers. I had my first real ford of a river and since it has been dry turned out to be very easy. This area is a world heritage site and there is a hike around the Gulf Hagas gorge which attracts a lot of dayhikers. Evidently this particular area was privately owned so is old growth forest. I would like to come back and explore! To make up for the easy morning hiking there was a good climb up Chairback Mountain on the afternoon agenda. It was the usual difficult climb until near the end where it became a hand over foot rock scramble to the top. There weren’t many good tent sites at the Chairback Lean-to so I continued on a little further to a beautiful lake site. It was so peaceful and I was enjoying my dinner by the shore when a group of  Boy Scouts showed up and then some other hikers. There was plenty of room for us all to spread out and share this beautiful spot .","Carl Newhall Lean-to

I was ready to hit the trail at 7am but somehow got confused at the trailhead. I assumed  the big open trail was the way to go but after about 1/4 mile the trail got smaller and overgrown and I realized  I had not seen any white-blazes. I checked my Guthooks app and sure enough I was not on the AT so backtracked to the trailhead. On the way I heard something huge crashing around in the underbush. I didn’t see it but I’m thinking  it must have been a moose. Back at the trailhead I realized that the AT went up a 6 foot rock face but with no white blazes I don’t know how I would have known to go that way. This first mistake was a precursor of how the rest of my day was to go. There were 3 mountains to cross this morning and whoever named them had a good sense of humor. First was Third Mountain, then Mount Three and a Half and finally Fourth Mountain. It was coming down Fourth Mountain that the clip lock on one of my trekking poles somehow loosened and my pole collapsed as I was leaning heavily on it going down a steep section. I fell on my butt and though I wasn’t hurt my pole bent a little. It is still usable and I hope can be repaired when I get to town in a day or two. It just seemed that the rest of the day I was slipping, falling or twisting my ankle at every opportunity. There were some great views today and some really steep and rocky descents. Amazingly despite my clumsy hiking style I made it safely to this Lean-to and am camped above the Shelter. I had hoped to get a little further along to position myself to get to Monson tomorrow but with the way my luck was going figured it was safer to just put my tent up and climb in.

There were several river fords today but all proved to easy because of little recent rain. In the afternoon I realized it was not going to be and then embraced the idea of a short 3 mile walk in the morning and basically 2 rest days in Monson.

I upgraded to a private room and found Seeker and his buddies were roomed across the hall.

She gave me good info on what the rest of my trek through Maine will be like. I must admit to some trepidation! I did try to find a dentist to fix my crown but nothing doing until next week so I’ll just keep hiking. One of the things I noticed about Monson were that kids were riding their bikes all over town, digging dirt in the ditches and just playing and having a great time without parents hovering nearby.

I huffed and puffed the first mile but then the last mile was a gentle climb over rocks and ledges. There was a great payoff at the top with 360 views plus lots of ripe blueberries for the picking and eating. I noticed in the distance a long line of giant windmills. I guess some would consider this view or sight pollution but it makes me happy to see these alternate clean sources of energy being utilized. I sat there for about an hour and enjoyed my lunch. The climb down the other side was a bit hairy in places but I managed to get to the next Shelter by 3:30. I had a dilemma because I knew that the next shelter was beyond my reach today and there was mention on my app of some stealth tent sites a few miles further on but they were near a road. I felt like I could have gone further today but chose to stay put. One of the differences I’ve noticed about this end of the trail compared to the south is the lack of stealth campsites.

There was a little condensation that I took care of with a quick towel wipe. The privy was across a small babbling brook that you rock hopped across but which had turned into a raging stream overnight and required my water shoes for crossing. I made a cup of coffee and could hear thunder in the distance so climbed back into my tent before the rain started again. I read my book on the kindle app on my phone until the rain slacked off about 8. It was pretty much impossible to keep those expensive orthotics I mentioned a few days ago dry with such soggy trail conditions. When rock hopping over one stream one foot slid in followed by the other so it seemed pointless to worry about it any further today. I have figured out that the granite type rock is pretty stable when wet but the slate type rock is like walking on ice. Roots are always hard to hike on but particularly treacherous when wet. I had a tough 4 1/2 mile hike up to Pleasant Mountain. Besides the climb always being hard for me it was extra difficult with the wet conditions. I progressed at a snails pace. Once I reached the summit the weather had cleared and there were some great views including Moxie Bald where I had been yesterday. I carefully headed down the other side of the mountain to Pleasant Pond Lean-to. I walked down to the beach to find the lake surrounded by vacation cottages, called camps here in Maine.

So many hikers have drowned fording this river that AT Conservancy now hires a ferry man to canoe hikers and their packs across the river 2 at a time between the hours of 9 and 2.  We were the first passengers  of the day and signed our release forms and donned the required life jackets.

The after lunch climb was up Little Bigelow Mountain which was a good 3 miles but again not too painful. It was near the top as I pulled myself up to one of the ledges that I saw the most unusual sight of my hike so far. There stood a middle aged dude with his pants around his ankles. My first thought was I had just caught him peeing so I looked away and coughed loudly to alert him to my presence. I glanced over and his britches were still around his ankles and he was muttering something. I didn’t really want to see more but I’m guessing he was having a private PeeWee Herman moment. A second loud cough and he covered himself and nonchalantly admired the view. Well, there’s nothing like such an encounter to help put some wind in your sails. I have never hiked so fast to put some distance between me and PeeWee. I quickly reached my intended campsite and was glad lots of other hikers were there. I was a little scared at the time but in retrospect it is a funny unbelievable trail story that has had  all my family in stitches.

I decided to stay in the shelter and was soon joined by No Tobacco and his girlfriend who I have been crossing paths with over the last week. Another couple soon arrived drenched to the bone. My timing was impeccable since I was the only one who made it without getting wet. The last couple to arrive turned out to be also from South Carolina, in fact just a few miles away from where I live. After dark another storm passed by and I was glad to be in the shelter despite having a  mouse run over my hand during the night.","East B Rd

I was soon crossing Grafton Notch and stopped in the parking lot for a snack and rest. There was a good slog up Old Speck Mountain and I found it really tough since I was feeling tired. I was rewarded with some nice views but couldn’t seem to get much traction today. My intention was to climb down Mahousic Arm today and camp right before the Notch but I  ended up stopping early at Speck Pond. This is the first pay campsite with an onsite caretaker and I had to set up my tent on a wooden platform. Since my tent is not freestanding I had to use rocks to anchor it down though I can’t see this being very good in any rain or wind. I googled a solution and will buy some cup hooks to anchor the corners at the first  opportunity. The caretaker required food preparation to be done under a tarped area and as I complied, a hiker greeted me and distracted, I spilled my pasta primavera on the ground. In typical hiker fashion I quickly scooped it up and ate it anyway. It was a little dirt crunchy but delicious. I had to scoop up the unsalvageable parts and scoop them into my trash bag so as to Leave No Trace.","Baldpate Lean-to

There was a great walk around beautiful Speck Pond and slight climb up to the top of Mahoosuc Arm. That turned out to be the easiest part of the day. The Mahoosuc Arm drops 1500 feet in 1 mile and is probably the steepest section of the trail. I just took it slowly but there was no getting around the difficulty. Glad I didn’t try this yesterday afternoon. At the bottom is the start of the Mahoosuc Notch which is 1 mile of bouldering and rock climbing. It is considered the hardest mile on the AT but the most fun. It was fun at first then got considerably more difficult. I ended up falling several times, mostly on to my back like a turtle with my pack on. I was constantly strategizing how to maneuver my way through and around the rocks. There were several spots that I had to take my pack off and squeeze through and was soon covered in mud and bloody from cuts and scrapes. It took me a little over 3 hours to go 1 mile and with all the stress and adrenaline rush, I was exhausted. I lay back on my pack for about 1/2 hour at the sign signaling the end of the notch. To add insult to injury there was then a climb up to Fulling Mill Mountain. Being so exhausted I just had no energy and also realized I had drunk little water today. I had about 1/3 liter left so was glad when I found a seep where I was able to collect and filter a liter. It turned out to be really sweet tasting water and helped me get to Full Goose Shelter.

Apparently a lot more hikers came in last night as the shelter was full and every barely flat piece of ground held a tent. I’m definitely in the NOBO bubble. The climb today was up Goose Eye Mountain which at first was just a foggy mess but quickly deteriorated to steady rain and was very windy. I covered my pack but didn’t put on my rain gear which I probably should have done with the strong wind blowing.There were several peaks to traverse and lots of boggy areas in the saddles. Usually the bogs have planks to walk across, though some of them have deteriorated and are under water. I came to a particularly wide boggy area with no walk boards. It looked like others had circumvented it by going to the right so followed suit. I took one step and then another at which time my left leg went deep into bog up to my upper thigh. It was definitely a panicky moment for me as I envisioned myself unable to get out and dying of hypothermia stuck in bog in a rainstorm. It was a bit of a struggle to get my leg out and it wasn’t until later that I realized I had badly bruised and scraped my thigh. Of course I was now covered in mud but fortunately it was still raining so it wasn’t long before it all washed off. By the time I reached the New Hampshire border it had stopped raining and I was pretty much dried out. It was a great psychological morale booster to get to the border. I think I must have set a record for the slowest time to hike through Maine!  Maine was so beautiful and rugged but extremely challenging for me to hike. I know New Hampshire will be tough too but it felt great to cross off another state. I had intended to reach Gentian Pond Shelter tonight but soon realized I might not make it before dark.

I had kept in touch with the Dad, Jim, and he had emailed me that he would be hiking with some friends near Gorham this weekend and wanted to offer me some trail magic by letting me stay in the cabin they had rented. I needed to walk 14 miles to reach the road crossing and seriously wondered if I was going to be able to do it with my slow progress over the last few days. Jim gave me some encouragement and told me I could do it. The trail turned out to be quite pleasant and easy to hike. I stopped for lunch at Wocket Ledge and a large bird soared overhead. Thinking it was a buzzard I shook my fist at it and told it that I wasn’t dead yet. It turned out to be a bald eagle  and was a special treat to see and maybe an omen of better hiking ahead. It was then an 4 mile descent with some nice views of the valley below. I reached the road about 6 to meet Jim and his new dog, Pax. Unfortunately Wally had succumbed to cancer after his hike last year. It was great to see a friendly familiar face. We stopped at a grocery store for supplies then headed to the cabin about 8 miles out of Gorham. Only 5 days since my last stop but I was filthy and the hiker funk level was high after such a strenuous section.

My good fortune meant I didn’t get the coffee or breakfast so after an easy 2 miles I stopped at the Rattle River Shelter and had a trail breakfast. My gut was a little wobbly this morning and breakfast didn’t seem to help. I think it’s a combination of nervousness about getting back on the trail and starting the notorious White Mountains plus the fact that I don’t drink enough water in town. Must remember to camel up! The hiking seemed easier today until I started up Mount Moriah. It was rocky but so far not quite as difficult as Maine. I’m sure the views must be great but nothing doing with all the foggy cloud cover. I was surprised to see only 2 couples and a woman hiking today. Maybe I’m behind the NOBO bubble now. I reached my destination early but knew I didn’t have another 7 miles in me today to get to the next campsite. There is no one else here tonight. There isn’t even the advertised caretaker to collect my money. I was feeling a little lonely and homesick so I turned my phone on and it rang immediately. It was my dear friend Kate who lives in NY near where I’ll complete the trail. We had a good chat and before hanging up she told me she is thinking about me everyday. That made me feel better! The encouragement I receive from friends and family is a tremendous morale booster and I’m so thankful. It’s starting to drizzle and now I wonder if I should’ve slept in the shelter.

Last night I ate a freeze dried dinner meant for 2 people that was 1000 calories and 40g of fat so today I definitely felt like I had more energy. I went over the Carter peaks and though there were initially no views because of the fog and being above the clouds, it finally burned off and was beautiful. I met a woman who was tagging all of New Hampshire’s 48 4000’ peaks and was heading to Carter S Peak. We kept overlapping and she was keen to know more about hiking the AT. At Mount Hight the view was incredible and I could see the Presidential Range where I’m headed. My goal today was to get to Pinkham Notch where I had booked a bunk at the Joe Dodge Lodge, a mere 13 mile day. At about 2:30 I realized that despite feeling strong today, I had overestimated my abilities with 6 difficult miles to go and 5 hours of daylight left. All the NOBOs I met today told me how difficult the stretch over the Wildcat range was going to be and I knew I wasn’t going to make it. I was mad at myself and frustrated. I stopped at Carter Notch Hut and I guess  my frustration showed on my face and Jesse, one of the Hut crew asked if I was ok. No I replied and dang it, burst into tears. Hate when that happens! He was so kind to me and went and changed my reservation to stay at this hut instead. Things took a turn for the better when I met a super nice couple, Bill and Carol and a woman section hiker who also hiked from Katahdin called Agent Starling. The Hut was located in a spectacular spot and was very relaxing. A great dinner was served that included soup, salad, homemade bread, lasagna and dessert.

If you are a purist about hiking the Appalachian Trail you may want to stop reading today’s post. In the spirit of hiking my own hike,I decided to skip the 5.9 miles of the Wildcat Range because I figured it would probably take me most of the day and put me behind on a planned stay at Lake of the Clouds Hut on Saturday. I hiked down to the road on the 19 mile brook trail and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was easy hiking along a stream with several beautiful waterfalls and I hiked the 3.8 miles in about an hour and a half. I was able to catch a shuttle bus to Pinkham Notch with the same driver that took me into Gorham last week. As I was getting off the bus I ran into Socrates who I last saw at Human Nature Hostel in Andover. He was taking the bus to Franconia Notch where he was meeting his daughter then flipping down to Virginia to hike. I picked up my resupply box and was eating a sandwich when I saw No Tobacco and Trooper. They had taken some time off in Gorham too. Trooper has a nasty sounding cold. The hike out of Pinkham Notch was pleasant and not too difficult. Right before I got to the Mount Washington motor road I was again subject to a most interesting and unusual sight involving naked bums. A couple were, paraphrasing the great late Marvin Gaye, passionately getting it on right on the trail. I coughed and then couldn’t help laughing . I told them not to mind me, I’ll be right on by and they could carry on. I think they were embarrassed but geez why would you decide to do it right on the AT, the most highly traveled trail on the east coast. I remember last year Moving Target told me he had a similar experience of interrupting trail passion as he hiked to a road crossing. As the trail started climbing Mount Madison it started to get tougher and I was tired. I ran into another familiar face, Oneious (?) a trail angel I had met at the trailhead in Monson though he had run out of goodies to share but offered me wise advise on the stealth sites ahead. I found the nice stealth site at the tree line. No Tobacco and Trooper are my neighbors about 100 feet away. Poor Trooper is coughing up a storm.

It took me about 2 1/2 hours to go the 1.7 miles to the Madison Hut. I filled up on water and took advantage of the $2 soup bowl offered to thru hikers and also had a pastry and coffee. There was a short climb up again and then it wasn’t too bad. The trail is basically a rock hop and very time consuming. I guess I have reached the age where I’m not so agile so I was very slow though I did manage to average about a mile per hour. The views were stunning and everything I’d heard they would be. It was a perfect day weather wise and you could see for miles. I have read that there are only about 40 days per year that the weather is good enough on Mount Washington to see the amazing views and I was lucky enough to hit it on one of them. The AT skirts the presidential range so there weren’t any really tough climbs although Mt Washington was a bit of a slog. It was funny to keep progressing toward Mount Washington and hear the train blow it’s whistle as it chugged up and down the mountain that I was walking up.. I finally reached the top about 4:30 and felt like I was in another world. It was teaming with tourists and there was a huge line for a photo with the summit sign, so sorry no pic. I hit the snack bar for a coke to help propel me the 1.5 miles to Lake of the Clouds and arrived about 6:30 just a little after the start  of dinner. It was quite delicious though I did notice some of my table mates staring at me devouring my food. I explained I’d been hiking for 6 weeks! This is a much larger hut than Carter Notch and a different sort of crowd were staying here. I felt a bit out of place so I snuck some food out to No Tobacco and Trooper who were doing a work for stay and had to sit outside like poor relations until all us paying customers were finished eating. They will get a work assignment, get to eat leftovers and sleep on the floor for free. It’s a strange system!

One of the women in my bunk room came rushing in and apologetically said she and her friend had got up early to watch the sunrise on Mt Monroe and she had accidentally grabbed my pole. Phew! Lake of the Clouds was literally in the clouds this morning and there was a brisk wind blowing. I felt like I was in the Scottish Highlands as I started walking. The trail followed the Crawford Path and was a nice easy tread way with fewer rocks though no views with the fog. It finally did burn off around 9:30 to reveal stunning vistas. I reached Mizpah Hut near lunchtime and stopped in for soup and snacks. The Minestrone contained about 7 pieces of veg and 1 piece of pasta so was more broth than anything but did provide extra sustenance to keep me going . The measly soup bowl was supplemented by some free leftover breakfast though so I managed to fill up. The afternoon was a lot of forest walking with 2 relatively easy mountains to cross with nice views. The Webster Cliffs were a bit tricky to negotiate but the view was outstanding.

I chose the campground and it turned out to be a good decision. The campground was about a mile and a half away and I got a ride on the first car. It was a realtor in a Mercedes with lovely leather seats. He thought I was in trouble but no, I just needed to clean up which I guess is some sort of trouble.. I apologized profusely about my hygiene but if it bothered him he didn’t say though I noticed he lowered all the windows. The campground was lovely and after securing some quarters from another camper hit the shower. The number of quarters you inserted determined the length of your shower.

She is French Canadian and just hiked here from Hanover. She is cutting her hike short because it is taking her longer than she had planned.

Today I slackpacked the Kinsman range which was 16.4 miles plus another 1.1 on the bike trail that leads to the Flume Visitor Center for shuttle pickup. The Hostel seemed to cater more to the dayhikers on the weekend so didn’t offer shuttle service. There was a cranky older women (yes older and crankier than me) in my bunk room.

I stopped for lunch where the trail crossed the brook. The next mile or so the trail followed the scenic brook past many waterfalls and was the highlight of the day for me. The climb up to the south peak of Kinsman Mountain was quite steep with some rock climbing but so much easier with just a daypack. I only saw three other hikers on my climb up, a day hiking man and No Tobacco and Trooper.

It started to get dark as I reached the bike path that would take me to the parking lot. The sunset was beautiful and a big full moon rose over the mountains. I tried calling the Hostel to see if anyone might pick me up but nothing doing so I called a shuttle service that only charged me a reasonable $10.

The trail again was pretty easy to negotiate and I was looking forward to getting into town. I walked along the Dartmouth College athletic fields and popped out in town near a gas station. A women pumping gas said “welcome to Hanover” and asked me about my hike. What a great welcome to town. She recommended that I could get a bite to eat at the nearby food coop so I enjoyed a sandwich there. As I started walking toward the post office I ran into Ellie and her friend who had just completed his hike at Katahdin. She said to him “I told you Nemo is so cool” Haha little does she know! She is such a sweet young women. They are staying at the same motel as me. I caught the orange line bus out to the motel and could hardly wait for a shower.

I did try for a hitch but this doesn’t seem like a hitch friendly type of town. I asked if I could stash my pack at a store where I had bought a fuel canister yesterday and they were happy to do it. I walked back to the Food Coop for some lunch supplies and snacks. They had a great selection and I was also able to buy a half loaf of bakery bread to add some variety to my meals. I went to Lou’s Bakery for a delicious second breakfast of eggs and a muffin. A little after noon I headed out of town. I crossed over the Connecticut River and into  Vermont. I usually like to get a selfie at the border but if there was a sign I must have missed it. The trail continued on toward Norwich before making another turn along a road of beautiful New England style homes. I find road walking really tough and was very glad when the trail finally headed back into the woods. The trail was very pleasant and I reached the Shelter at about 4.

Yesterday when I wanted to sleep in I couldn’t but today I was awakened by Ellie packing up and looking at my watch saw it was already 7. By the time I had stowed my sleeping gear and got out of my tent she was gone. She puts in big miles so not sure if I’ll see her again. The weather was perfect today, sunny with occasional big puffy white clouds. I decided not to push myself today and just enjoy the day and the hike. It occurred to me that the last 2 months of hiking through Maine and New Hampshire were somewhat stressful. The difficulty of the trail often made me aware that if I made a mistake, I could seriously hurt myself. Today’s hike was stress free and wonderful! It wasn’t long before I approached a road and then went under an interstate highway. There was a pretty long road walk that went through West Hartford and most passing motorists honked or waved. I met a group of cyclists getting ready to ride at the library and they called me over. They wanted to hear about my hike and offered me fruit and energy bars. Really nice group! I met a few dayhikers and saw a couple of weekend backpackers. I could tell by their clean spiffy gear and fresh scent. I arrived at Thistle Hill Shelter near 3 but it was too early to stop so I continued on since there seemed to be plenty of stealth sites. After crossing Cloudland Rd there was a bit of a climb and then a perfect open area with a nice grassy spot and a great view. I had found my campsite for the evening. The sunset was a beautiful!

I also awoke to bubble gut or hiker gut. I felt nauseous and there was definitely some major bubbling going on in my belly forcing me to put my cat hole digging tool to work multiple times. Sorry if too much information but it’s sometimes the reality of long distance hiking. Last year at about the same mileage I’m at right now, I had similar problems that were part of the reason I abandoned my hike in NY. When Western medicine couldn’t figure out what was going on, I visited my acupuncturist who concluded I was going through a major detox with all the weight I had lost. She said fat harbors toxins and as your body is shedding that stuff, it’s natural to feel ill. Sounds plausible to me so I’m going to work through this with the hope I’m getting healthier. I do know I have been losing more weight since my hiking skirt which was snug at the beginning is now loose. Mr N, always teasing me, says I just need to fashion a Jethro belt out of my bear rope. Anyway, I didn’t get going until about 9 by which time my tent was almost dry and once moving I did start to feel better. It turned out to be another pretty day and I enjoyed my hike. There were several road crossings and when I reached VT 12 I headed toward On The Edge Farm stand which was reported to be hiker friendly and had baked goods for sale. On the way I passed a farm with a huge red barn and was greeted by Dan who told me he operates a free secret Hostel. He was really friendly and I would have taken him up on his offer if there wasn’t still a good part of the day left to hike. He suggested I stay at The Lookout if I made it that far. At the Farm Stand the owner made me a breakfast burrito and I had an apple turnover. It was delicious and my belly didn’t rebel. Fortified, I easily made it to The Lookout which is a private cabin that the owners let hikers sleep in for free. It had a great Widows Watch that required a steep ladder climb and where I was treated to amazing views of the surrounding area. I didn’t see any backpackers today and only 2 trail runners.

I did start to feel better after a while so just buckled down and pulled out my rain gear and started making forward movement at about 10. Again, I felt better as I started walking. There isn’t much to say about my hike today other than my feet got really wet and I just plugged along. Before the Shelter there was a ladder cabled to steep section that made me laugh. Where were the ladders when I needed them in Maine. I reached the Shelter at about 3 and figured I’d just stay there since if I went on, I’d end up in Killington and have to stay in a Motel if I wanted to avoid tenting in the rain. I hadn’t seen a soul today but as I sat at the Shelter drinking tea I heard several hikers approach. It was Chris and the 2 Steve’s, a group of friendly section hikers. Their funny banter really cheered me up plus they offered me dinner. Someone in their group had backed out of the trip so they had extra food. I had climbed in my sleeping bag to stay warm and one of the Steve’s said we’ll make you dinner but we’re darn well not serving you in bed, so get up and eat.

My plan today was to hike to a side trail that would take me to an outfitter where my resupply box had been sent, then head back to the trail and hike to Hwy 4 where I would catch the bus and head into Rutland. After hiking about .8 mile I stopped to check for service on my phone and realized I had left my P-Style hanging outside the shelter. Now this is one of my favorite pieces of gear since it allows me to pee standing up, so after the palm to forehead moment I backtracked to the Shelter. My forgetfulness causing an extra mile and a half of walking today. There was a bold chipmunk who kept jumping into the shelter last night. I had forgotten to put my trail mix into my hung food bag so when I reached into my hip pocket for a snack there were multiple holes in the plastic bag where the little varmint had helped himself to some snacks last night. It wasn’t too bad in the rain today until after Thundering Falls. All the rain made for a powerful display tumbling down the rocks at the Falls. The rain really started coming down hard and I was drenched by the time I got to the outfitters. The guy behind the counter suggested I try the deli down the street and said he couldn’t really recommend the Hostel where I had planned on staying in Rutland. I had had misgivings about this hostel which is run by a strange cult like group so I left my pack and box at the outfitters while I went to eat and figure out my next move. So despite the best laid plans I ended up staying at a motel in Killington anyway. I took the bus to a local laundromat and drank a beer and ate snacks in the bar above while my clothes were washing.

There was also fruit, pastries, and boiled eggs. Quite the spread. I didn’t get going until about 9:45 when I backtracked to the outfitters and headed back to the AT on the side trail. It was quite foggy and the trail was really sloppy after 2 days of rain. I did something today that I haven’t done the whole time I have hiked. I listened to music on my phone. It was a great distraction! It gave my mind a rest from overthinking everything and re-examining my life for the one millionth time. It made the day go by faster and I didn’t check my app every hour to check my mileage. I have most of my music collection on my phone so I can probably listen for days without a repeat. Since it was foggy there really weren’t any views but it was pleasant hiking through the woods. I got to Cooper Lodge near Killington Peak which sounds more than what it actually was. It’s basically an old shelter in disrepair. I decided to put up my tent on the nearby platforms. While preparing dinner, my interesting neighbors arrived. They are 2 couples that are either Mennonite or Amish. I wasn’t sure how to politely ask. The women wore long dresses and the men sported chin beards.

At least the sun came out today and it was a picture perfect fall day and I didn’t need to listen to music as a distraction. It was too nice a day.

My 2 pairs of hiking socks are both wet and stinky and my shoes are no better. I ran into the Amish couples again. They told me they had gone into town because of rain and were doing a loop trail today. I imagine the long dresses the women wore would be problematic when wet. They appeared to be a very heavy fabric. One of the most enjoyable sections today was the section around Little Rock Pond. The reflection of the colorful tree foliage in the pond was breathtaking.

I took great pleasure in making a lot of noise and hearing the groans of the late night crowd as I packed up. It was pretty foggy and still a little dark and since my night vision is not that great I went pretty slow but was still able to get to the road before Jim and Andrew arrived. We are going to hike together over the next few days, so while they spotted a vehicle near Bennington they dropped me off in Manchester Center so I could do a few errands and resupply. It didn’t take too long before we were all hiking through mud and misting rain. It wasn’t raining enough to dig out my raincoat until after we stopped for lunch and I got a little chilled. Since it is a holiday weekend, Jim and Andrew suggested I hike ahead to secure us all a space in the Stratton Pond Shelter which we expected to be crowded,  so I put  my legs and feet in high gear and took off. Stratton Pond was beautiful despite the clouds and I hung around for a few minutes while I  got my water from the stream before walking the  2/10 mile up to the shelter. The shelter was crowded but I claimed the last 3 available bunks. Surprisingly I met the hiker who I learned is called Ron Rico who I had last seen with All Good near Gulf Hagas in the 100 mile wilderness. He told me that All Good had left the trail and gone to meet up with his family in Italy. I had kind of sensed that his heart wasn’t in it for much longer when I saw him in Monson. Some other hikers I hadn’t seen since I camped next to them in Safford Notch in the Bigelows in Maine were also here. That was the spot where I spent my birthday in my tent because my fear of going over the peaks in a rainstorm. They told me that I had made the right decision because it was awful and they wished they had stayed put too. Jim and Andrew with Pax soon arrived and told me they had stopped to take a swim in the pond when the sun came out. I sort of wished I had done that too since I am on day 5 with no shower but think it was probably a bit too cold for someone who has lived in the south as long as I  have. Jim and Andrew had packed in a supper of real genuine chicken (not freeze dried) and fresh vegetables that they shared with me. It was delicious!!

Unfortunately our bunks were next to a hiker who had to have been the loudest snorer on the planet. I definitely think he had a sleep apnea issue. Jim accurately noted that he sounded like he was drowning at some points during the night. Phew, he and his partner are headed to the same destination as us today too. Jim and Andrew were going to take a different trail today that was a couple of miles shorter than the AT that I’m hiking, so I will meet up with them later. There was a climb of a couple of miles up to Stratton Mountain and it was muddy and misting rain but since morning is when I’m strongest I was soon at the summit. There was a fire tower but not much incentive to climb to the top with no chance of a view. The caretaker who was staying in the nearby cabin came out and I chatted with her for some time. She provided some great trail magic of homemade cookies and an apple. As I started down the other side of the mountain it started to get muddier and muddier. The fallen leaves made it often hard to see where to place your feet to avoid the mud. I was really starting to feel some hotspots on my feet. I was not sure if it was blisters forming or trench foot so stopped at the Black Brook foot bridge to check things out. I do have some Lotrimin for my feet but for it to work you need clean dry feet which is pretty impossible to achieve right now. I spent about 30 minutes washing my feet in the stream and taping up all my hotspots and continued on to what turned out to be the muddiest section all day. I soon could feel the tape coming off my toes so my efforts were pretty useless and I soldiered on. I reached the Shelter about 4 and Jim and Andrew told me that they had been there since 1. I guess I was a slow poke today. Soon our snoring friend arrived and we learned his trail name is Blue Line and his partner who is Chinese is Flow. They are delightful people and enjoyable to talk to but we weren’t looking forward to the loud racket again tonight.

We stopped at Kid Gore Shelter for lunch which had a great view though obviously had some leaks. The sun peeked out fleetingly but not for long. A Taiwanese couple were there and told us this was a four star shelter with the view but the next one, where we were headed, was definitely five star. A Long Trail hiker I had met at Minerva Hinchley Shelter, the mousey one, stopped by and I learned his trail name was Pie Face which had a great back story. He was soon finishing his hike so doubtful I’ll see him again. I haven’t fallen in a while but took a spill on a slippery root and busted open a spot on my knee that had finally started to heal up. We reached the top of Glastonbury Mountain which Jim said had a magnificent view but I’ll have to take his word for it because it was socked in too. The Taiwanese couple were right, this shelter was particularly nice with a great covered porch. We were soon joined by our hiking friends Blue Line and Flow. I was intrigued by Flows cooking.

He likes to be comfortable for sure and although only 9 months old and still a puppy is big enough to make sure he is comfy. We hiked through mist for a couple of hours this morning but lo and behold the sun finally came out. I was so happy to see it and it just made for a great day. The foliage was so pretty in the sun. We stopped at Porcupine Ridge for lunch and finally had a view. There were wind turbines across on a distant ridge which I had always thought were a good thing, but learned from Bookie at the Notch Hostel that there were negative impacts on wildlife and bird migration. I guess nothing is perfect. The sun was out but the trail still a mud bath. Today, it was Andrew’s turn to take a spill and he cut his hand open pretty badly. It actually got quite warm today though the forecast is calling for some pretty cold temperatures over the next week. Jim offered Pax’s dog blanket to help me over the next week. I seriously thought of taking it but it was pretty heavy and I have a lightweight quilt at home. I called Frolicking Dinosaur to see if there was a possibility of her express shipping it to me. She was able to do so though it won’t arrive until Friday. It wasn’t long before we got to the road and parking area and headed into town. I had a motel reservation and offered the use of the shower to Jim and Andrew. It turned out to be a little bit of a fiasco since the Indian motel owner thought I was smuggling extra hikers into my room without paying, plus we had brought Pax inside since the sign said dog-friendly. He got pretty angry but I did some respectful groveling and apologizing and was able to smooth things over. We went into town and had a few beers and good meal to celebrate then Jim and Andrew dropped me back off at the motel before heading home.

I don’t think I’ve been this thin since I was about 20 which ironically was when I first thought about hiking the Appalachian Trail. I know there is a lot of stuff that just doesn’t matter to me anymore and it is so liberating. I haven’t shaved my legs since Monson.

I found a cool restaurant nearby with locally sourced food and had a delicious salad, then over to a bakery for a cinnamon bun and chai latte. I mailed some postcards to my grandkids and stopped in at the Visitor Center to get details on the local bus system. I thought it was so cool that they had bicycles available to use at no charge if I wanted to borrow one. This is a nice town.

Evidently the museum has the largest public collection of her work which is considered primitive art. I’m certainly not an art critic and found it  interesting but not really my cup of tea though I did enjoy seeing the rest of the exhibits particularly the more contemporary art upstairs and some of the exhibits about the history of Vermont.

In fact I made my breakfast from the comfort of my bed. Because I couldn’t get my lazy butt going this morning I missed my goal of getting to Mt Greylock and the Bascomb Lodge. Oh well, tomorrow! What a difference a day makes. Yesterday when I was wet and cold, I thought to myself that I’m never going to be able to finish this hike. Today was cool but sunny and beautiful and everything seemed possible. I had a huge morale booster when crossing another state line from Vermont into Massachusetts. The mud became less and less and all but disappeared. I wonder why Vermont is so muddy when it rains? Maybe something to do with the soil composition. The fall color is not as advanced here as in Vermont. I also began to see a lot of familiar Mountain Laurel. The trail descended a steep rocky section, before following a fairly wide noisy stream. The trail suddenly popped out behind some homes and followed a driveway to the road. There was a good bit of road walking through town but no food options without straying from the trail. When the trail headed back into the woods I noticed a couple of invasive plant species were growing unchecked, namely Ligustrum and Barberry. Sorry to see that! Before losing service I called my grandson to wish him happy 8th birthday. He received a monopoly game as a present and we have a date to play a game when I get home. The climb up Mt Prospect was a grueling mile and a half but had a wonderful view of the valley below from the summit. I watched a couple of glider planes going up and down the valley. I bet that would be an exciting way to fly. There are 3 nice guys from NJ section hiking Mass and Connecticut in the shelter tonight .","Seth Warner Shelter

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604549,"My shelter mates were up at 5 packing up and gone by 6. One of the guys, Walt, hurt his knee on the rocky section yesterday so I gave him my knee brace that I am no longer using. The forecast rain started just as I began hiking but at least it was fairly warm out today. I was looking forward to stopping at Bascomb Lodge for some food at the summit of Mt Greylock, Massachusetts highest mountain. The wind really started whipping as I approached the summit and it was socked in with fog. I understand there are great views and also an impressive war memorial but I couldn’t see a thing. I went into the Lodge to find the 3 guys from the shelter last night and they told me I was going to be really disappointed. The Lodge was closing because of the bad weather. I went into the restaurant area and asked if there was any chance of getting some food before they closed but the cook said no. I pleaded my case to the very nice cashier and she fixed me up with some soup, bread, and a sack of baked goods. We were all told we had to vacate the premises so I went over to the nearby Thunderbolt Shelter which was an old warming hut. Walt called Uber to get off the trail since my brace wasn’t helping his knee and the other 2 guys continued on to the next shelter. The Thunderbolt had signs saying it was only available for overnight use in emergencies but I considered staying put since it was enclosed and out of the rain. I ate my goodies and can’t believe I took a nap even though I’d slept a good 12 hours last night. I stepped outside at 3 and it had stopped raining and even warmed up so I decided to go for it. Steven, one of the guys from last night is here at the shelter. His other buddy must have missed the turn for the shelter or made a run for the next town of Cheshire. The rain is coming down hard again and I’m looking forward to seeing the sun tomorrow.","Wilbur Clearing Shelter

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604550,"There was pounding rain last night then when that stopped, howling winds began. It was fairly warm when I turned in but was really cold this morning. Steven was up early and gone by 5:45 so he could get to the next shelter, 17 miles away. I had a much harder time getting going. My fingers were soon really cold and my wet shoes were literally frozen like popsicles. With cold hands and feet, I was miserable. My emotions were very near the surface this morning and my thoughts were caught in a loop of thinking that the weather was going to sabotage my finishing this hike. I called my Mum, Frolicking Dinosaur and had a tearful conversation. Many people seem to think I’m some sort of badass for hiking this trail, but sometimes I’m just a big wimp especially in cold weather. I knew I needed new shoes and had spent an hour yesterday unsuccessfully trying to figure out where to have them sent. She was able to get REI to ship some to me in the next town of Dalton where she booked me 2 nights in a motel. I’m getting the same shoe I have been wearing but in a waterproof version which I hope will help with the wet feet issue. They should arrive tomorrow. She also advised me to consider staying in a  motel more often if that is going to help me get to the finish line. It is much easier to escape bad weather in the south with the many hostel options, not so much here in New England where there are few. I’m going to look into slack packing options too. I’m so grateful to my Mum who has been a great support to me on this hike and been one of my biggest cheerleaders and providers of wisdom and common sense. Problem solving done, I felt better with some solutions in sight. The trail was pretty wet after last nights rain and there were a lot of branches scattered about too. I came across several blow downs across the trail which looked new, probably from the wind last night. The sun did shine today but there was a definite briskness to the air when the wind blew. I wore my leggings under my skirt for the first time and several additional layers. After 4 miles of hiking I came to a major road crossing in Cheshire and walked 2/10 mile to a gas station with a Dunkin Donuts. I ate about 2000 calories worth of breakfast sandwiches to power my walk to Dalton. There was a bit of a climb up to a rocky outcrop called the Cobbles and then fairly easy walking from then on, in fact it was really pleasant when I was sheltered from the wind. Seemed like a lot of leaves were blown off the trees last night and they covered the obvious path of the trail. I had to keep a sharp eye out for the white blazes. I eventually got to the road and still had about a mile to walk to the motel which is quaint and very clean. There are a few cold nights ahead but a good stretch of clear days that I hope will get me closer to the finish. Less than 200 miles to go now!","Mark Noepel Shelter

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604593,"You know how when you use google maps and make a wrong turn, the app recalibrates and you have to reset. After yesterday’s challenges, today I reset. I had a delicious breakfast at the nearby coffee shop, then did my laundry. Everything done by 11 am so I decided to Uber out to Washington Mtn Rd and slackpack back to town. The sun was shining although rain was on the radar. My awesome driver, Michael picked me up and somehow his Uber app took us down a dead end gravel road that didn’t lead to the trailhead. He turned his app off and I directed him to the trailhead using google maps. He was so apologetic but I told him not to worry, I really enjoyed seeing some of the surrounding country. He gave me a nice hug and wished me best of luck when he dropped me off. The trail had little elevation change and I took off, unencumbered by my heavy pack. Unfortunately the sun soon disappeared and sprinkles of rain started to fall. I did put on my rain gear when I got to Kay Wood Shelter but more because of the gusty wind than rain. It took me a little over 4 hours to get back to town. My new shoes had arrived at some point and I think they are going to help me keep going. Tomorrow a quick trip to Walmart and then I will continue south to my next destination.
I read an eloquent blog post this morning about what it’s like to finish your hike and how it changes you. This young women put into words a lot of the feelings I’ve been having but have had trouble articulating. https://thetrek.co/the-trail-changes-you-2/?ref=author_posts, I guess like the author, I’m peeling away the layers of Christine to reveal the true and authentic me, Nemophilist.

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604616,"While eating breakfast at the coffee shop I noticed a tropical mandevilla plant in a container outside that seemingly survived the cold temperatures last night. I Ubered to Walmart and purchased an orange watch cap since I understand it’s now hunting season and I have been hearing gunfire over the last several days. I also found some extra heavy gloves and some foot and hand warmers so I can survive these cold temperatures  too. A few food purchases and I was ready to Uber back to Washington Mountain Rd where I had begun yesterday. It was frigid but after walking for less than an hour I was removing my puffy jacket. My new shoes are so comfortable and I probably should have retired  my old shoes a couple of 100 miles ago. It was such a relief to hike with warm dry feet and toasty fingers! Despite being really cold, the sun was shining and it was a perfect day. The terrain in Massachusetts has been relatively flat and easy to hike so far and today was no different. There were several pretty ponds that the trail passed, though with the cold temperatures I didn’t stop for too long. It seemed no time at all before I approached US 20 and was heading toward Berkshire Lakeside Lodge. This is one of the nicest motels I’ve stayed at recently and surprisingly one of the most inexpensive. Unfortunately a resupply box sent from home has not arrived yet, despite an expected delivery date of yesterday. I need the food in it so hopefully it will come tomorrow. The motel owner says mail usually comes about noon and I was welcome to stay in my room until it does. I was hoping to push off early in the morning to take advantage of warmer weather before the next arctic blast but if I’m to be delayed this seems like a very nice place to have to wait. I turned on the tv briefly and suddenly realized that there is a good chance I’m not going to be home to vote in the upcoming election and it’s too late for an absentee ballot.

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604665,"It was really annoying me this morning to see a beautiful day unfolding outside and I needed to wait for my box to arrive. I decided to make lemonade out of lemons and found a road access about 12 miles south that if I could get a ride there, I could slackpack back to the Lodge. No cars available on Uber so when I went to the office for breakfast, asked them about it. They had a number for a local shuttler so I gave her a call. Marilyn said sure, soon as her brownies came out of the oven. Turns out Marilyn is an AT trail legend, the “cookie lady”. I was a little concerned when she arrived because she seemed so frail and elderly, but she was a great driver and we had a wonderful conversation during the drive. She pointed out the quaint village of Tyringham, then an old Shaker compound, and we made a stop at the Gingerbread House, an English style cottage with a thatched roof. When we got to the trailhead she pointed to the steps climbing a fairly steep hill and I took off hiking up them. After an hour of hiking, I stopped to check my app to see what my pace was and was surprised to see that I was further away from my destination than at the road. Yep, I had hiked 2.3 miles in the wrong direction. It’s a mistake a lot of hikers make but was a first time for me and hopefully the last. I’ve heard of hikers breaking down in tears when this happens and I probably would have too if it wasn’t such a beautiful day. I just laughed at myself as I turned around and headed back. At least it only took me 45 minutes to get back since it was mostly downhill. The irony is that I’ll have to hike that section for the third time tomorrow when Marilyn takes me back to the trail. I think the trail must be making me pay penance for that section I missed in New Hampshire. By the time I reached the Shaker Campsite it was already lunch time though I’d only walked 3/10 mile from the road. I stopped to eat some leftover pizza from last night. The trail passed through some meadows and I could see the back end of the Shaker compound and the Gingerbread House. There was a hard freeze last night and I could smell the distinct odor of foliage that has been killed by the frost. That smell always makes me kind of sad because it means the growing season is definitely over for sure until spring. There was some board walking over a swampy area then I came across a young cow who must have escaped from the pasture across the road. It kept bellowing for its Momma I guess. I had to climb a stile and the trail actually passed through the field of cows. It really warmed up today and I eventually had to stop to take off my leggings and a few layers.The rest of the day passed uneventfully and was so pleasant. At about 5 I passed Goose Pond and could hear Canadian Geese honking in the distance. I didn’t have enough daylight left to stop at the iconic Goose Pond Cabin and was hiking as fast as I could to avoid having to walk in the dark. I passed over the Massachusetts Turnpike and was soon back at the Lodge. My box had arrived in my absence.","Fernside Rd/Jerusalem Rd

The trail remained similar to yesterday with sections through forest and passed several ponds and farmland. I met 3 thruhikers who were slackpacking today who remembered me from New Hampshire. I sort of remembered them but it was a little fuzzy. I got to Tom Leonard around 4. It’s a very nice shelter with bunks and a loft and located near a deep ravine called Ice Gulch. A couple out for the weekend are tenting on the platform and a couple of trail maintainers, Cottonmouth and ? arrived.

I woke up about 10ish and Cottonmouth and his buddy had put up their tents and retired for the evening. Those stinkers didn’t wake me for dinner. I was up early and packed up and hiking by 8. It wasn’t that cold in the gulch last night but as I climbed to a ridge the temperature really dropped and the wind was ferocious. Somehow I tripped over nothing and twisted my ankle. It hurt enough to make me sit on a rock for about 10 minutes but I was soon fine to keep going. I ran into the 3 thru hikers from yesterday coming from the opposite direction. We all exclaimed “you’re going in the wrong direction”! After much deliberation over Guthooks, it was determined that I was going in the wrong direction. One of the guys asked me if I’d hit my head when I fell but of course I hadn’t. We soon found how I’d got turned around. There was a sharp turn in the trail with a path heading toward a road and it had a white blaze. I took it and must have doubled back towards the north. Hope Cottonmouth fixes that!  I had only gone about 1/4 mile back and thank goodness I ran into the hikers. Just before I crossed a road I heard but didn’t see a large tree come down. The wind was really whipping. There was some nice walking through some corn fields and then along the Housatonic River. As I approached US 7 I decided I wasn’t up to the wind today. It was supposed to go down to 31 in town tonight but probably colder at higher elevations. The wind was making it feel much colder. As I checked for Uber, 2 joggers I had passed earlier stopped and asked if I was ok. When I told them I was figuring out how to get to town they offered me a ride. It turned out that Kathleen and Kevin had also helped out Sandals and Turtle who were also from S.C. and we had shared Bald Pate Lean-To back in Maine. Kathleen gave me their phone number in case I need a ride in the morning. Geez, I am overwhelmed by the generosity of people I have met on this journey! I will never forget the most amazing beautiful kindnesses from so many different people along the way. Great Barrington is a charming upscale resort community. I enjoyed breakfast for lunch, then found a great food coop where I bought salad for dinner later and some arnica for my ankle. I had a good talk with my daughter who told me it is really cold down in the Smokies too. She also told me how moved she is reading about my adventures.

The 3rd hiker, Blue Liner, not to be confused with Blue Line the world class snorer, completed his thru hike yesterday and was beginning his journey home to Florida. € and ¥ were the other 2 hikers who wish to remain publicly anonymous.  They told me how they got into trouble on Glastonbury Mountain. Their gear got wet, the temperature dropped into the 20’s and they woke to 2” snow. Ever since they have been slackpacking to try to get further south. Joe dropped me off where I stopped yesterday and took my photo to post on his instagram. He is a true trail angel, offering shuttles for free, though I threw in $5 for his gas fund. The trail was easy and traversed through more farmland until I crossed Jug End Rd and started to climb. There was a great view at the top and I stopped for lunch. There was much more climbing and descending today than I have done in a while. I had been told it was quite an exposed section and I was glad I had postponed hiking it until today and without yesterday’s wind. My favorite section today was the 1/2 mile ledge walk after the summit of Mt Race. There were nice views of the valley and even though it was cloudy the fall foliage looked pretty spectacular. I’m in my tent for the first time in a couple of weeks. With the colder temperatures it has just been easier to stay in shelters while on the trail.

Sages Ravine was very scenic with a nice stream and many waterfalls. I had wanted to get to the campsite here last night but am now glad that I waited until this morning when I was fresh and not tired and able to really enjoy it.

Bear Mountain is the highest peak in Connecticut and had a fine view of the surrounding area. I stopped for lunch just before climbing Lions Head. I had noticed there was very little foliage color here. A woman out walking her dog said it had been a terrible foliage season this year. There was a pretty steep rocky descent from Lions Head but then a nice pleasant stretch into town. I stopped for a second lunch, picked up my package at the post office and then headed over to Vanessa Breton’s house.

There was a climb up from the road and then a lemon squeezer like rock formation to squeeze myself through. No problem for me with my weight loss and a slackpack. There was a definite briskness to the air especially when the wind kicked up but the hiking was fairly easy and pleasant. € and ¥ had told me to be sure to stop at the Mountainside Cafe just 1/4 mile off trail at Falls Village so I did. I can’t say I was as enthusiastic about it as they were. It was good food but quite expensive . Welcome to Connecticut I guess! There was some nice walking along the Housatonic River in an almost park like setting with benches every so often. I noticed lots of Equisetum or Horsetail growing everywhere. It’s such a weird prehistoric looking plant and I tried to remember if it is native or not. Google revealed that yes it is but it sure grows more abundantly here than I’ve ever seen, as if someone left the gate open. The falls that give Falls Village it’s name were quite a sight and very impressive. The trail eventually pulled away from the River and climbed up Mt Prospect. There were several nice views before the trail sharply descended to the road and the walk back into Salisbury. I was back in town by 4:30 and enjoyed some tea at the local bakery before heading back to Vanessa’s. Vanessa told me that her son said bad weather is coming Saturday and she was worried about me. I had already noticed that it looks like a big rain event and have been trying to figure out somewhere to weather the storm.

I think that would be awesome and hope it’s something we can make happen. She dropped me off at yesterday’s starting point and I was on my way. The sun kept peeking from between the clouds and it was a great hiking day. The trail was similar to yesterday with gentle ups and downs. I did come to Guinea Brook that was impossible to rock hop. Determined to not have to ford across, I bushwhacked upstream about 1/4 mile to a downed slippery log and I was able to inch across without getting wet. The trail eventually dropped down to the Housatonic River again which is now quite wide. This section is really scenic with a wide level path following the river and occasionally passing through some pasture. It was distressing to read a sign that warned against using the river as a water source because of contamination by pcbs and heavy metals. I got to the Shelter at about 3:30 and met Greg who is out here hammocking and testing some new winter gear. He was really surprised to see another hiker since it is supposed to get quite cold tonight. I set up in the shelter which isn’t nearly as nice as the Massachusetts shelters but will do the job. There is a road about a mile away and a train tracks across the river so this beautiful spot is a bit noisy.

There was a great view from the top which I could also recall from that hike 4 decades ago. The rest of the day was pretty agonizing for me because I couldn’t seem to get a good pace going. For some reason I felt really tired today.

By 2 I had only reached Mt Algo Shelter and still had 8.4 miles to go which at my current pace seemed impossible. Unfortunately the nearest town was Kent which is very upscale and super expensive. I dug into my Guthooks app and there was a comment about a women called Barbie who took hikers into her home for a reasonable fee. I gave her a call and she said she would be right there to pick me up. I don’t know how I deserve these extraordinary kindnesses that keep being showered on me but it has happened again. Barbie’s home is exquisite with the most wonderful view. Relatives own the farm next door where they raise a heritage cattle breed called a Randall that originates from Vermont.

As a horticulturist, I found it very interesting to read a book she had put together about the scriptures and meanings behind the plants she had installed. I would love to come back during the growing season and see it. When I told Frolicking Dinosaur about this place, she expressed interest too, so maybe we will return sometime in the future.

She was delighted and we planned timing around a high tea she is hosting for some clients tomorrow. We enjoyed a dinner of soup, bread, and salad and another fabulous desert.

On the way she showed me where the trail passed near Bulls Bridge, a genuine covered bridge, so I would be sure not to miss it. She also took me to the site where a large oak tree had once stood. Legend is that George Washington’s troops sheltered under the oak while he went to the local tavern. Alas the oak died though Barbie remembers it being huge.  We also passed a one room school house which her aunt had actually attended. This area is full of history and I had a great tour guide. About 8:45 I started hiking and it turned out to be a great day for it. Not much sun today but the temperatures were perfect, not too hot nor too cold. The trail followed the Housatonic River again before getting to the road which led to Bulls Bridge. I walked up to the single lane bridge and took Barbie’s suggestions of where to get some great views. She had also told me another George Washington story about his horse falling into the river at this location and he had paid a sum of $215 to have it rescued. I walked a little further to a country store and enjoyed a coffee and snack. Two young women asked about my hike and we chatted  for about 1/2 hour. The trail followed a road for a while before heading back into the woods. There was some easy climbing then a difficult descent from Schaghticoke Mountain. It was pretty rocky and yesterday’s rain made it very slick and slow going. By 3:30 I was approaching the road and giving Barbie a call. Her tea had been a moderate success. Some of the attendees had been small children who really didn’t have the attention span for a tea. As we got back to her home, the sun came out and I was able to get in a quick tour of her garden. After dinner Barbie offered to give me a reiki session and foot massage in her reiki room downstairs. Of course I said yes.  I went into a deep state of relaxation and my feet felt wonderful.

I went over to the hiker friendly garden center and chatted with the guy in charge. When I told him about my background, he almost offered me a job. I laughed and told him working would interfere with my hiking life, though it was a very well done garden center. I had thought of walking 1/2 mile down the road to a deli but the garden center guy suggested I check out a food truck parked a few yards down the road. I had some tasty fish and chips and sat and chatted with the section hikers who had also been tempted by the awesome food, despite just telling me that they didn’t intend to stop. Next stop was the Appalachian Trail train station. Hikers can board a train here to get to NYC. I wasn’t tempted though I am thinking of taking the train home when I’m finished which probably would entail a trip into the city.

They told me they had been forced to go to Danbury to find accommodations during the storm. The afternoon was perfect hiking weather with blue skies and 50ish temperatures. I was soon crossing I-84 and the trail paralleled the highway for some miles. Although it was pleasant hiking the road noise was not and I didn’t really enjoy this section. Just before going under the Taconic Parkway there was a section of trail with many trees down. Almost looked like a tornado had touched down. I arrived at the shelter at about 5 and it is a really nice one with bunks and a covered porch with picnic tables. I chatted on the phone with my friend, Kate who will be picking me up. She jokingly told me to not book my flight home yet since she might drive me back to SC. So I replied “are we going via California?” We had a great laugh imagining that scenario but I’m almost a little serious.","Telephone Pioneers Shelter

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604979,"There was a good frost this morning so I stayed in my bunk as long as possible. Turns out that there is no savings to taking the train home plus it would get to S.C. at 3am so I booked a flight home for two weeks from now. For some reason that made me incredibly sad and weepy. I posted in a women’s hiking group that I belong to on Facebook and got some wonderful support. I guess I’m not the only one to feel this way as they complete their hike and I got some good advice. If there was a foot of snow on the ground and it was 20 degrees, I’d probably be glad to be finished. Today actually turned out to be the nicest day I’ve seen in about a month. It was sunny and 60 degrees. € & ¥ stopped by the shelter as I was packing up. We figure we must be the last SOBO’s this far north. I didn’t start hiking until 10 but made it to the Canopus Lake Beach in time for a lunch of snacks. Everything was shut up tight and no one around. I took my shoes off and waded in the lake but too cold for more than that. I am in a stretch of trail with limited options for camping and no shelters. I remembered Mudsmeller telling me about a camping spot they had found in this area though I’d lost the guide where I’d made note of it. Fortunately I was able to find the text thread and found the really nice spot with picnic tables and porta johns. Loads of bats were flying overhead as I ate my dinner. It is Halloween!","RHP Shelter

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605006,"Last night I was so warm in my sleep system that I had to throw off a quilt and remove my booties. It feels so good to be warm again. The trail started off gentle enough but progressively got rockier with many steep ups and downs. I can tell that I’m near the end because this is similar terrain to how it was before I quit my NOBO hike last year. At a road crossing I ran into € & ¥ and they beckoned me over and said you’re gonna love this. It was the foundation of an old barn used as a smallpox inoculation station during the revolutionary war. I have really enjoyed seeing many of these interesting historical sites along the trail. About 2 ish I got to the Appalachian Deli and killed an hour or 2 eating and chatting with € & ¥. They are an awesome couple who met on the trail. They told me about their plans of retrofitting a van and living and traveling in it. Sounds appealing to me. Rain is forecast tonight through tomorrow and I had a motel reservation in Fort Montgomery. Grandpa, the motel owner, had told me he would pick me up here or at the Bear Mountain Bridge. I decided to have him pick me up at the deli, then I’ll walk the 6 miles to the bridge in the rain tomorrow. Since there is an Army-Air Force game on Saturday everything is booked up though I did find a place to stay at a religious retreat tomorrow night. Grandpa came knocking on my door clutching a $20 bill and told me a welder working at West Point called Roy had left $120 to distribute to hikers. I didn’t really want to take it but he insisted. When I got back from dinner Grandpa called me over to meet Roy who was a little bit in his cups so there was a lot of hugging as I told him about my journey. I thanked him and told him I had decided to pass on his gift, I didn’t know to who or when, but figured I’d know when the time was right.","Dennytown Rd

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605022,"It was raining when Grandpa drove me back to the deli but stopped as I started hiking. Grandpa either went a little overboard with the aftershave lotion this morning or my nose has become more sensitive after living mostly outside for the last 3 months. Geez has it been that long? When he gave me a hug I picked up some of the scent and could smell it all morning. It was really driving me nuts. It’s sort of funny that the hiker funk scent is less objectionable to me now than the artificial scents that permeate the world. I lucked out in that the rain held off during my hike though there were some ominous clouds in the sky. It didn’t take me long to reach the Bear Mountain Bridge and my walk across the Hudson River. I really enjoyed the bridge walk with its beautiful view and the spectacular foliage. A driver from the Stony Point Center picked me up at the south end of the bridge for the twenty minute drive to the center just as the rain started. I’m really glad I came here. It is a religious retreat center for all religions and I saw many represented. My room reminds me of my dorm room in college with bathrooms in the hallway. The grounds were very peaceful and I checked out the labyrinth and meditation building during a lull in the rain. There was even a hermitage for those wanting a deeper more private retreat. The center produces many of the vegetables used in meals and I checked out the gardens and greenhouses that I was pleased to see were still producing some healthy looking greens. I had to pay a little extra for dinner but so glad I did. It was a very healthy buffet of vegetables, salads and a beef or vegan stew. I tried both and they were delicious. The rain is coming down hard and I believe at least an inch is expected tonight.","US9 Appalachian Deli

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605130,"Amira was my driver for the return to the trail and I assumed she was Muslim since she wore a head scarf in the tradition of that faith. She worked in the garden at the center though we talked about my hike and experiences on the trail more than our shared interest in horticulture . She told me hikers bring another dimension to the center and are a great fit into what it’s all about. I would highly recommend a stay at Stony Point. It gave me hope to see so many nationalities and religions all seeking peaceful communion. It rained really hard last night and I’m guessing it was more in the 3-4” range than the 1” forecast. It was in fact still raining when Amira dropped me off. As I entered the Bear Mountain Zoo a woman charged out of a building and said I couldn’t go in until 10am, in thirty minutes. I probably would have waited if it wasn’t raining but since I’m not a huge fan of zoos anyway decided to take the blue blaze trail. I’ll be in the area for a week after I finish and can come back then if I wish. I soon was starting the climb on many steps up Bear Mountain. It was like walking up a waterfall because of all the runoff from the rain. When I reached the summit the wind really picked up and gusted for the rest of the day, though it did blow the rain off. It was really neat to see the NYC skyline in the distance from one of the view points. It became a perfect fall day despite the strong winds that felt at times like they were going to blow me over. The foliage color here in NY is the prettiest I’ve seen in New England. Vermont was nice too but the weather not good for leaf peeping when I hiked through. I reached the shelter just before dark and had planned on sleeping in it but there were about 10 people all cooking dinner inside so I decided to put up my tent. The wind continued to roar through the night and the temperature dropped though I was very cozy and warm.","Bear Mountain Bridge

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605135,"It was time to turn the clocks back last night but it doesn’t really affect me on the trail. I get up and start hiking when it gets light out and stop and climb in my tent when it gets dark, no matter what time it is. The wind finally stopped sometime during the night and today turned out to be the most glorious fall day. I have been on a roller coaster of emotions over the last week as I approach the finish line but today I felt excited and so happy. As I started hiking I saw a herd of deer.  Most of them scattered but a doe and her fawn stood in front of me on the trail and stared at me for the longest time. As I entered Harriman State Park I saw lots of day hikers and my obvious long distance pack caused many to stop and ask me about my hike. It felt great to receive many congratulations and well wishes at my almost completion of the trail. One group of friendly Chinese hikers insisted on a selfie and taught me how to say congratulations in Chinese. I stopped at Fingerboard Shelter for lunch but saw no sign of the problem bear that has been harassing hikers for the last few years. There was a lot of trash in the shelter so no wonder a problem. I passed through the Lemon Squeezer rock formation and it was a bit of a challenge and obstacle course. I had to take my pack off which is difficult to carry when not on my back but like all difficult sections so far I made it through. I made a mistake of not getting water in the park which I realized once passing over the NY thruway and starting the climb up Arden Mountain. Fortunately I saw some water dripping off some cliffs and went off trail a little ways to get a couple of liters. I met 2 section hikers coming from the opposite direction who told me that the outlet from Little Dam Lake is flooded and moving too fast to ford. They had to turn around and road walk that section. I will reach that area tomorrow and will have to decide what to do when I reach Orange Turnpike. Though you are not supposed to stealth camp in NY I didn’t have much choice with the distance between shelters and shorter days. It’s not an ideal site but will do for what is probably my last night on the trail. I keep hearing coyotes yipping and howling and they sound very close.","William Brien Memorial Shelter

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605138,"I went through my usual morning rituals of breakfast and packing up but knew after 3 months and 2 days I was going to get to my destination today and it would be the last time.  Rain was forecast but didnt start until I reached Orange Turnpike where I had to decide whether to stay on the trail or take a 3 mile road walk to avoid the flooding issue at Little Dam Lake. I hate road walking with my pack plus figured that after 48 hours the water should have receded so I stuck with the AT. I should have known that I wasn’t going to finish this hike without another challenge and it turned out to be a hard one. When I reached Little Dam Lake Outlet what was supposed to be a rock hop was a raging waterfall. Determined not to have to backtrack and do the road walk, I walked upstream a little to where the water wasn’t moving as fast and decided to try to ford across. It was pretty deep so I stripped down to my undies from the waist down despite it only being only 38 degrees and went for it. The water came up to my hips and bottom of my pack but I made it across. That water was dang cold too! When I got to the other side I was laughing and whooping and hollering. I must have looked like a crazy woman. I was so proud of myself! When I got to Wildcat Shelter I was officially done and went and sat in the shelter and had a joyful little cry unlike my tears of frustration when I stopped hiking here last year. I talked to family back home then walked the 2 miles to Bellvale Farms Creamery. Today was the first time in all the days I have hiked on the Appalachian Trail over the last two years that I didnt see another soul. The ending was without much fanfare and pretty much went how my hike went. I was alone and incredibly happy! I couldn’t time my ending with my friends day off so Ubered into Warwick to the same motel I stayed at last year. Tomorrow I’m going to rent a car and spend the next week visiting my friend and exploring the area before heading home. 
I’ll write a conclusion when I’ve had a chance to relax and process this extraordinary and wonderful journey of a lifetime. Thanks for following this rambling stream of consciousness journal with its poor grammar and occasional bad spelling. Despite all that, it is an accurate account of my hike and feelings along the way and I stand by it.

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605168,"Hiking the Appalachian Trail has fulfilled a lifelong dream that I had thought was an opportunity I had missed but obviously had not. It certainly didn’t go as I had imagined or planned but I wouldn’t do anything differently and have no regrets. My thru hike attempt became a two year series of long section hikes and I’m fine with that, in fact I’m glad it turned out that way. I was able to enjoy every day, even the difficult ones and certainly hiked my own hike. I loved my many stops in trail towns and the chance to explore those local communities. I never joined a trail family or group that I hiked with consistently but actually enjoyed and embraced the solitude. I did meet many amazing people and certainly feel a kinship with the hiking community. They are my tribe! There were several people that I made deeper connections with and I’m so happy our paths crossed.
I think I’ve expressed my gratitude and amazement at the kindness and assistance I received from people along the way. I am still overwhelmed by this aspect of my hike and it made a deep impression on me. Despite the the divisiveness that many would have you believe is a sign of our time, I experienced a lot of love and generosity. It has definitely made me want to try to be a better and kinder person.
This journey was much more than a hike along a beautiful path. This hike gave me much time for reflection and I discovered I was much stronger and more resilient than I thought. I think I’ve sometimes made life decisions based partly on fear which I resolve never to do again. My wish is that my children and grandchildren receive just a little inspiration from my hike and never be afraid to seek fulfillment of their own dreams. This challenging and wonderful journey has forever changed me.
So what is next for Nemophilist? This journey has just opened the door to wanting more adventure. I was inspired by the many hikers I met in New Hampshire who were hiking all 48 of the 4000’ mountains in that state, so I am going to accept a similar challenge closer to home of hiking all 900 miles of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. I definitely would like to do some trail maintenance and may seek out volunteer opportunities with the Foothills Trail Conservancy of which I’m a member and the trail is practically in my back yard. As for longer hikes, I am interested in the John Muir Trail, the Pinhoti Trail, the Bartram Trail, the  Benton MacKaye Trail and the West Highland Way in Scotland but am open to all hiking opportunities. So many trails to hike and I intend to keep putting one foot in front of the other as long as I’m able. I never feel more alive and as content than when carrying everything I need in my backpack and venturing along a beautiful trail.
Happy Trails!

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605859,"I thought I was finished writing about my hike but am compelled to write one more post. I knew post hike depression was real. I experienced the blues a little last year when I completed my hike, though I was sick with a bad cold then, so consequently pretty content to return home.  Plus, I knew I would return to the trail this year to finish my hike and had that to look forward to. This year it has hit me a little harder. I sort of knew it was creeping up on me when I made my plane reservation to come home and felt so emotional. I didnt want my journey to end despite the poor weather I was running into and seeming to be one of the last hikers heading SOBO. My 40 year dream was coming to a conclusion. I have to admit that I never felt happier than on the trail and when I completed my hike in NY. I keep looking back at my photos and can see it in my face and remember the pure joy I was feeling at those moments. My friends on Facebook even commented on the happiness they saw in the photos I posted online. Life was so simple on the trail! I just walked, ate enough calories to power my hike, made sure I  had enough water, found somewhere to sleep then repeated it the next day but all in the glorious setting of the trail. Life was pretty much broken down to the basic necessities of life and I loved it. I loved the freedom hiking gave me. Fortunately just like childbirth, you dont remember all the really difficult parts so much because the happiness overshadows any pain. In the real world I think Im a bit of a nerdy loner though I know how to put on the act to appear fairly normal and function as expected. On trail I met so many  people that I identified with and genuinely liked. Trail camaraderies turned out to be one of the best parts of my hike.  Ive said it before, I found my tribe. I became braver, less judgmental and open to meeting different people. It was all so wonderful and real!Arghh! So what is happening to me now! I know part of it is chemical. Hiking day after day for months on end sends endorphins flowing through the body that give a natural high so it seems that ending a hike would naturally cause a slump. So although intellectually I know this is all pretty normal and well documented by other long distance hikers it just doesnt help me feel better. I feel disoriented in my return to so called normal life. A few days after getting home I became overwhelmed in the grocery store at the prospect of having to fill the cart with groceries for the next week. The house feels too warm. I dont sleep well like I did in my tent. The high volume drone of the tv my husband enjoys watching is really grating on my ears. In fact I have stopped watching tv altogether, especially the news. Its too stressful. None of my old clothes fit me any more. Im a different person both physically and mentally than when I started this journey. I dont think Mr N quite knows what to think of me now and is a bit afraid of the changes in me. Last year he told everyone that not all of me came back because of my weight loss but this year I think more of me came back at least in mental strength. Im not quite sure what to make of it all either and am still trying to process it.So I am trying to move on by taking the advice of others who have traveled this path before me. I had thank you cards printed up to send to all the people who helped me and places that I stayed while hiking. I was surprised to send out over 70 cards though unfortunately I didnt think ahead to get everyones contact information that assisted me. This was very cathartic and provided a great trip down memory lane. Im continuing to hike with a hiking club that tackles some of the more difficult local trails every Friday. They have been very welcoming to me and it is giving me great pleasure. I spent a Saturday doing monthly trail maintenance on my favorite local Foothills Trail. We installed some new signs in pouring rain. It was so satisfying and great fun and I plan on continuing. One of the guys in the hiking club thru hiked the AT in 2013 so I asked him how he handled his post hike. He told me he didnt, he just kept going and went on to hike the Mountains to the Sea Trail the following year. So in that vein, I have already made plans to spend 3 weeks hiking in Scotland next spring and cross off another bucket list item. I just finished reading a book about the PCT and also discovered all the PCT YouTube videos online.  As I watch them I started to think to myself that maybe I could do that! It looks amazing! When I helped the Conservancy with trail maintenance the crew leader gave me a new trail name because I was so busy and constantly on the move. He said he was renaming me Perpetual Motion. I actually really like that name and thought it very fitting!Just tapping this all into my journal and acknowledging my feelings helps immensely! Like hiking Ill take this one step at a time and will get through it! Thanks for reading! See you out on the trail! Nemophilist",,View Entry,"Dec 12, Wed",0
