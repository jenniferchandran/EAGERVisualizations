We parked at Amicalola Falls Visitor Center and had Ron Brown shuttle us up to Deep Gap, NC. We took 12 days to hike south to Springer Mountain and then down to our car. What a fabulous journey! We hiked shelter to shelter and tented near the shelters. 92 miles","Deep Gap, NC

ProneToWander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547560,"Our second section hike was in October of 2014. We parked at Fontana Dam and Ron Brown shuttled us to Deep Gap, NC. Of the 9 days we were out, we encountered rain on 7 of them. One day we only hiked one mile from A. Rufus Morgan shelter to the Nantahala Outdoor Center. Karen had a fall the day before which gave her a black eye when her hiking pole hit her across the cheekbone. We spent a day and night at the NOC. Then hiked on to Fontana and our car. Our last day was gorgeous views and sunshine. 72 miles.","Deep Gap, NC

ProneToWander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547561,In May of 2015 we hiked the Smokies! We had to stay in the shelters through the national park. We had cold days and warm days and cool nights. One night was down in the 30's! The views were fantastic and we met some wonderful people. Karen still keeps in touch with a few of them. We hiked the Smokies in 8 days and stayed at Standing Bear Farm just outside GSMNP. Got showers and laundry taken care of and set off for Hot Springs the next day. The highlight of this trip was Max Patch. Its a grass covered bald with a 360 degree view. We could look back to the Smokies and see where we had come from. We were fortunate to spend the night on Max Patch. It was windy but not too cold. We saw a glorious sunset out of one side of the tent and a spectacular sunrise out of the other side. two days later we entered Hot Springs and stayed at Laughing Heart Hostel. Great place! Then we had A Walk in the Woods shuttle us back to Fontana and our car. 113 miles,"Fontana Dam

ProneToWander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547562,"Early October 2015 we drove up to Hampton, TN and parked our car at Black Bear Resort. They shuttled us south to Hot Springs. It was a 65 mile drive and we were about to hike 150 miles through the mountains north to Dennis Cove Rd where Black Bear Resort is located. We stayed at Laughing Heart Hostel again and planned to hike out the next day. Due to hurricane Joaquin passing by, we stayed a day in Hot Springs. So when we started we were a day behind schedule. We arrived in Erwin, TN 7 days later and stopped for laundry, showers, a coke and 22 snickers bars. No...we only ate one each but bought 22 for snacks on the rest of our journey! Randy eats 2 snickers a day, Karen has one. This section has so many gorgeous balds and fabulous views. We met Dee and Rocketman just before Bald Mountain--what a tough hike. They left in Erwin to head back to jobs and life in Asheville, NC. Roan Mountain was a challenge and the night in Roan Mntn shelter was a cold and windy one. There were 10 of us in the shelter that night and we were all in the sleeping bags by 6:30 PM just to get warm. No one stirred til 6:30 the next morning. The next day we started over about 4 balds after Carver's Gap. We had gorgeous weather. It was going over Hump Mountain that we met Hooshr and later his hiking partner Mountain Dew. Hooshr thru hiked this year (2016) and we followed his journey here on trail journals. Mountain Dew has little wooden crosses that he makes and leaves on the trail for people to find. He left two for us. We hiked with them to Dennis Cove Rd where we all headed home for much needed rest! 150 miles","Hot Springs, NC

ProneToWander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547563,"Our 5th section was from Dennis Cove Rd through Laurel Falls Gorge, Watauga Lake and into VA where we crossed the 500 mile mark of the AT. It took us about 5 days to get to the TN/VA border and Damascus where stayed at Woodchuck Hostel for a night. Great place--Woodchuck does a wonderful breakfast for the hikers. Along the way we met an 85 yr old woman section hiking the trail for the second time. She had hiked the first time when she was 60. What an inspiration she was! After Damascus we met a couple our age from PA thru-hiking the trail. We hiked along with them til we left in Marion. Bonnie & David are still on the trail. They hiked from Springer to the halfway point in PA then went home for about a week. They jumped ahead to NH in order to finish the northern section before Baxter State Park closes in October. Then they will go back to do the parts they jumped over. They will soon enter Maine. What an inspiration they are, too. Early in this hike we realized that trying to make it all the way to Atkins was going to be hard. We cut back on our miles and decided to end 11 miles before we planned. We had parked at Rambunny's house in Atkins and she graciously agreed to drive to Marion to pick us up. Great lady--she has hiked the AT 3 times I think. Highlight of this section was the Grayson Highlands and the wild ponies. 113 miles","

ProneToWander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550201,11 miles today! Not bad for a second day. We had a couple of steep climbs but most of the day was nice and level with gradual climbs through pastureland. We stopped in Atkins at a gas station got cokes and sat under a tree tot lunch break. One of the VA trail maintainersstopped and chatted for a while. He gaveus a good run down on water sources-its been very dry. We met Yard Sale Abe Hooch SOBO's both from GA! Yard Sale grew up in Marietta but now lives in Lula where Randy is from! Tomorrow we climb Walker Mntn and reach the quarter way marker of the AT.,"chatfield shelter

ProneToWander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550202,Last night we got camp set up just before the rain came. Through the night we had some rip-roarin' thunderstorms. We started climbing first thing today and gotnto the 1/4 way sign. We climbed over many fence stilesnwhich gets really oldnafter a while. At one point we crossed a road and found a cooler with sodas in it! We each had one--well Randyhad two--and we wrote a note to the person. Who left it thanking him for the trailmagic. The climb after went better with all that sugar in us! Camped at a ni e little spot near a creek hoping the tent dries out.,"crawfish trail campsite

ProneToWander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550210,Great day today. We hiked up and over brushy mountain and down to Trent's Grocery. We got showers and did laundry which were very challenging with no soap or towels to dry with! Found a small amount of detergent in a box and used it for the clothes. Showered with a bottle of hand soap we found in one of the bathrooms. Dried off with our washcloths! Not set up for hikers! But the hamburgers and fries were amazingly wonderful! Gobbled those down then headed off for another 6 miles of trail. Camped along a creek in a pretty nice spot. It was so humid though that everything feels wet the next day,"jenny knob shelter

ProneToWander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550211,Knew there was rain coming in so we skipped woods hole hostel and went on to docs knob shelter to cover about 3 miles that we wouldn't have to do in the rain tomorrow. Spent the night on n the shelter so we wouldn't have to pack a wet tent. There was a young girl at the shelter when we arrived. She was very nice but lost in so many ways. I talked to her a bit while Randy got water. She was hiking south and wanted to cover 9 more miles which meant night hiking. I'm still hoping she made it safely.,"dismal creek campsite

ProneToWander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550212,Headed out from the shelter in rain. Climbed to Pearisburg mountain where the wind was blowing and it was cold! The descent into town was steep and we overshot town because of a trail reroute that we were not aware of. Think we did an extra mile or more then had to turn and go back to the road that would have taken us into o town. Now we hen we leave we will have to do that section again! Hotel is dirty but has a bed and real bathroom. Zeroing here because of rain,"doc's knob shelter

ProneToWander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597262,"Where do I start?  In 3 days I’ll board an airplane to fly to Harrisburg, PA to continue a 5 year journey of section hiking the AT.  This trip will be very different from past hikes since I’ll be heading out without Pace Setter, my wife.  She’s been a constant companion for the past 8 section hikes and 1,194 miles that have taken us to the 501 Shelter near Pine Grove, PA.  Our prior hikes, before I retired, took place in spring and fall, lasted from 9 to 14 days and covered distances ranging from 81 to 144 miles.  After I retired our hikes became longer (25, 28 and 17 days covering 225, 268 and 170 miles respectively).  The longer periods of time and distance, not to mention the rocks in PA, took their toll on PS’ knees, so she’s taking time off to heal in hopes of returning to the trail we both love.  She’s graciously agreed to allow and even encouraged me to continue to hike without her.  While I’ll miss her, I am very thankful for this opportunity.
 As the days count down and the things on the “to do” list get crossed off, I find an odd mix of excitement and apprehension: Excitement to get back on the trail, see new sites, meet new folks, test my own physical and mental capabilities, and possibly make it all the way to Katahdin; Apprehension as to being so far from home alone, coping with the summer heat and bugs, finding water, the logistics of resupplying on the trail, and wondering if I’m physically and mentally capable of pulling this off.  Overall, I’m cautiously optimistic, knowing that whether I cover 100 miles or the remaining 1,000 miles, I’ll do my best to enjoy every bit of it.
 More to come,",,View Entry,"Jul 15, Sun",0
