Sharon Kanya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592730,"The pack I own is a NorthFace 35 liter pack. While it worked really well for my previous hikes in Utah and the Grand Canyon, I was starting to realize that the pack was not going to give me the room I need for the thru hike. Jim convinced me to go back to REI to look at larger packs, even though I really was against spending more money on another pack. After trying on 2-3 packs I settled on a Deucher  45 + 10 liter pack which, while being heavier than my old pack, also seemed to have a lot of padding which would hopefully help with the sciatic pain I am having. I did wear this pack on a couple of training sessions I had on the treadmill, carrying any where from 15-21 pounds and it seemed to feel pretty good. Time to take it out for a real hike now!
Jim and I left in the morning for the Potowatami trail. I decided to increase my pack weight up to 23 pounds for the day. It was a nice day with decent temps for hiking. Our intention was to hike the full 17.5 miles but in the end only got in about 11.5 miles. We got a bit turned around and missed some turns that would have allowed us to hike further. That ended up being fine since I had continuous sciatic pain to the point that I was having trouble walking. My biggest concern at the time was, what if my pack is going to aggravate my sciatic continuously and I wouldn't be able to do the hike as planned! I was feeling depressed and worried that I would have to quit this thru hike before I even started.
Thankfully, after a few treatments with my chiropractor over the following week, a lot of stretching and a few tears, I was finally able to get back on the treadmill and begin working out again. My first couple of training sessions were without my pack and then I began adding weight again until I could once again carry up to 23 pounds without worsening pain. My new plan was to add 2 pounds of weight to my pack every 2 days of training in hopes that I could get to my needed 32 pounds by the time we were to leave. It seemed like a race against the calendar at this point.",,Potowatami Trail,"May 13, Sun",11.50

Sharon Kanya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592731,"Today is day 1 and Mount Katahdin awaits us. The day is cold and overcast and misting lightly. We weren't sure we were going to be able to hike today because of the rain and cold temperatures and possible snow on the mountain. We didn't actually know until the shuttle drove us to the mountain if we would be hiking or not. 
Thankfully we were able to switch out our heavy packs for a day pack probably weighing 5-10 pounds. Much easier climbing than with our 32-36 pound packs.
The lower section of Katahdin was challenging enough with stairs of rock going only one direction, up. Talk about exhausting! The burning muscles in the legs was unbearable at times. It was only to be outdone when we reached the higher elevation where we had boulder/rock scrambles with a fall off of thousands of feet of we made a wrong move or lost our grip. Me being afraid of heights only intensified the fear I felt throughout the experience. Every time it seemed like we were at the top, there was another level we had to climb. Reaching the top felt so good but I knew the trip back down would be difficult as well and we couldn't really celebrate until our feet were back on the ground.
In total it took us 9 hours to go up and back down the 5 miles of Mount Katahdin. It was exhausting, grueling, and so mentally and physically draining. I now really understand why they recommend not starting in Maine first. I don't feel that I am as prepared as I need to be for this journey. Time will tell...","
