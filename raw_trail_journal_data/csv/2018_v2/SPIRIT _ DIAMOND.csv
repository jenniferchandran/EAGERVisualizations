SPIRIT & DIAMOND,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582338,"We are two Best Friends who have decided to do this thru-hike together.  We do not have trail names YET.  We are both retired Army and our motto is ""If We Aint Laughin, We Aint Living"".   We CAN be loud, but it's only as a result of our comedic nature.  Life is too short to be anything but happy.  One of us can't help playing pranks on the other, only for a good chuckle - of course.  NOTE: No one ever gets injured as the result of these pranks. 
We are on a mission to Move, Laugh, and Explore!!!  Moving to stay healthy - Laughing to live Longer (because laughing adds yrs to your life :-) ) - and Exploring ANY location every chance we get.   Hope to see and meet as many fellow hikers as possible, though you may not ALWAYS get our humor, we still look forward to releasing as many endorphins as possible!!.   NOTE:  If you want a ZEN moment and we are in the area, we apologize in advance.   :-O.   HAPPY TRAILS",,Mt Katahdin,"Jan 23, Tue",9
SPIRIT & DIAMOND,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583992,"Well, It’s almost here.  My BFF and I, Diamond, will finally start on our journey of thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail in just a few days.   Mind you. we pretty much have zero hiking experience.  Besides ruck marching in combat boots and field exercises in the Military, that’s about it.  But what we do have is determination and the fact that we are extremely resilient has somehow lead us to take on the challenge of a thru-hike.    After a year of research, nearly $3000 spent on gear, clothes, shoes… more shoes… yep.. testing more shoes… still not 100% sure about my current shoe choice, and purchasing accessories… it looks like we finally have our backpacks loaded and awaiting GO time. In just a few days we will take our first steps on the Appalachian Trail.   
We did take about 4 days to do a trail run on the Foothills Trail in SC/NC.  That experience  taught us some good lessons.   We learned to never turn your back on your pot while on the stove.  For some reason “Casper” came out that night and slide the pot off the stove.  Turns out Raman noodles full of Pine Needles makes a very interesting meal choice.  I must admit a little pine tar was actually an improvement to these overrated curly noodles that I hate so much!!!!
So, a friend of Darcy’s insisted to NEVER LEAVE HOME without Gold Bond MEDICATED powder (this friend was also a female).  OKOK.  So we took the advise and had our little mini podwer containers.  About day 2, I decided to take a Baby Wipe Bath…….  Just to “freshen up”.  I took the MEDICADED Gold Bond, put some on my hands and patted it on me, chest to bottom.   WARNING… WARNING…. Medicated Gold Bond belongs absolutely NO WHERE ON OR NEAR a woman’s private parts!!!!!!   I screamed bloody murder, jumped up, fell down, dayum near flipped my whole tent over (as I was all zipped up inside of it).   I rolled over desperately trying to find my baby wipes meanwhile there was a flame brewing in my midsection, or so at least I swore I saw flames!!! . My eyes we all watery, I was literally on FIRE.  You would have thought I caught either an STD from “Gold Bond” or that I was thrown back in time to WWII to a Japanese Torture camp.  Desperately and franticly in search on those daymn wipes… I finally got a hold of them under my sleeping bag.  Thirteen wipes later it finally downgraded to a simmering heat!!!!   Thirty minutes later I was back to normal.  Needless to say, HELLO Johnson & Johnson…… good ole baby power is now in my pack.
