Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586081,"Hoping to leave on April 12th for Harpers Ferry to start another section hike.  The plan is to complete Maryland and Pennsylvania.  Except for 30 miles in VA south of Waynesboro, VA this will complete all the miles from GA to Great Barrington, MA.  I am driving my vehicle on this trip and will use it as a mid-point re-supply for each 60 to 70 mile segment, shuttling back and forth to move it forward every few days.  Plan to catch the 30 miles in VA  on the return trip to GA.
Here is hoping the weather has begun to head toward spring for MD and PA.
Additional editing to follow after May 11, 2018.
You will find that a lot of this journal reflects my attitude of walking in rocks for a couple hundred miles.  Boring and a pain in the royal butt.  With a little luck there may be some humor scattered about.  The only enjoyable part of this trip was the people.  Made some new friends and renewed relationships with some old ones.  The AT is really about the people, not the trail.  Looking at your feet day after day is not much fun, especially in Pennsylvania. Here is hoping the next section I attempt proves to be more enjoyable.
And I did not stop for the last 30 miles I skipped in VA.  Worn down and tired and needing to get home for family stuff.  Will try and collect those miles in Sept/Oct this year.",,"Harpers Ferry, WV","Apr 08, Sun",0
Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586217,"Hard to believe this is the 11th year I have been tackling the AT.  There was a 5-year hiatus in there somewhere for family and personal elements.  Life Happens!
If there are no other issues, I should be loaded and ready to leave early Thursday morning for Harpers Ferry.  I still need to make up a few bags of trail mix and dig the jerky out of the freezer.  Reservations are made for the Teahorse hostel for Thursday and Friday with a shuttle to drop the truck at Penn Mar set for Friday.  The first trail segment will be from Harpers  ( 14 April) to Pine Grove Furnace State Park.  Penn Mar gives me a re-supply point about halfway, that is if my truck is still there when I arrive!!!!!!!!!!
A weekend of fun with a bunch of ""hangers"" is set for the Furnace from 20 to 22 April!  Oh yes! More food and fun than a hiker can stand.",,"Harpers Ferry, WV","Apr 09, Mon",0

Should have taken the other route - more direct I think. But I hate I-81---- too many trucks and rough in many spots.

Uphill from there to top of South Mountain. Famous for Civil War battles leading down to Sharpsburg battle in 1862.
Rest of the day we played tag along the crest of South Mountain and got together again Gatland State Park. Finished the day with a 200 foot climb out of Crampton Gap. Set up hammock and got the usual stuff done before dark.

Weather is supposed to be a killer after lunch. We headed to Rocky Run shelter and arrived at 0930. After looking at the weather radar decided to hang in the shelter rest of the day and night. Great decision as it came a ""wall banger"" of a storm all night. High winds and lots of rain. Seven other hikers came in before dark.

Another short day due to weather. Drizzle all day until 1400.
Left Rocky Run at 0930 in the rain. Temps in the 40's. Good trails today as far as grades and climbs were concerned. Otherwise, there were rivers of running water and ponds all along the trail. Lots of sidestepping to stay dry. Winds driving the drizzle all morning. Made Pine Knob at 1330 and had some lunch. Achin and Trudger were already in and had changed out of the wet clothes. Got some dry stuff for myself and set about looking for a hammock spot. 
Old, old shelter will only hold 6 plus it leaked badly last night. Another reason to hammock. Seven more hikers arrived later in afternoon. One young guy doing a thru and a couple doing flip-flop thru, having started at Harpers Ferry.

Cold wind blowing from the west. Temp at shelter was 33 before we left and never got over 40 all day. Occasional fine snow flakes and ice pellets off and on all day.Hiking was good most of the day. Last 2 creeks to cross were raging and had to take cross-country detours off trail about a quarter and a half mile each to get back on trail. Then ----- one huge 600 foot climb out of the last creek (Little Antietam Creek) at the end of day. A butt kicker!
Got passed by 3 thru hikers today - Flash, John Goodman, and Switchfoot.
Made the Raven Rock at 1645. A beautiful new shelter with lots of room - 2 stories. Eight in shelter including Opa, a thru hiker. Cold night in the 30's when we hit the sack.","Pine Knob Shelter

Asked to join them for the day and got a yes answer. Fun folks. Left Pen Mar at 0815 and headed down to the Mason-Dixon Line at MD / PA border. Got the pictures and headed out for a short day.
Made a "" little"" 600 foot climb and then some rollers until downhill at end of the day. Got to Tumbling Run shelters at 1330 and discussed moving on to next shelter. A 1000 foot climb stood in the way. Not good for day's end so we stuck to these shelters.
Outward Bound group of teenagers were eating lunch and then moved on. Several others came and went. Two thru hikers rolled in late and stayed in the other shelter for the night. Another Outward Bound group came in at dark and tented on the tent area - Yeah!
Today's weather was chilly. Mostly 40s and windy with occasional ice pellets and drizzle for a minute or two at the time. The trail was relatively good for where we have been in the past few days. Some rock scrambles as usual.
Good day hiking with the new folks. Bangles thru hiked last year so she and JW are doing MD/PA again - for ""fun"". Bangles moves like the wind, leaving Johnny and myself behind. Tomorrow will be a blast.","Pen Mar

Not climbing out there in the morning wind at 35 degrees.
Rest of the day was cruising the trail and hopping boulders and rock gardens in spots. Warming sun made hiking a lot more fun today. Met a few folks southbound and a couple headed north. By noon no one else was out.
Made it to US Hwy 30 at 1245 and headed 0.4 mile to the Timbers Restaurant, a hiker friendly place. Lunch with new friends and then ice cream. They left to hike on and I got my shuttle ride back to Pen Mar to collect the truck.
Spending the night in the Trail of Hope Hostel just down from Timbers. Back there for dinner tonight and breakfast tomorrow. Then on to Pine Grove Furnace State Park for MAHHA hammock hangers get together tomorow and Sunday.

Quick climb out of the park for about a mile. Soon thereafter I met Johnny Walker and Bangles heading in to Pine Grove Furnace. She had sprained a knee yesterday and they could not join me for the festivities. We parted ways and hope to meet again further up the trail.An hour later, met M& M (Megan and Matt), citizens of the Crown! They are trying to catch JW & Bangles.Flushed a turkey on an upslope near mile 4. Turkey season started yesterday in PA. DO NOT MAKE ANY GOBBLE SOUNDS here!Today was really good trail. Cruising the AT, kicking rocks and taking names: Quartz, quartzite, phyllite, and some more mundane stuff! The AT was flat and easy - typical trail. Never any rocks or ups and downs. ( see picture)
Made good time and got to Birch Run Shelter at 1245 - --- 9.5 miles, 4.5 hours. Took 45 minutes to rest and eat, then on to Quarry Gap. Mostly smooth trail, few ups and downs. Great weather. Actually got a little too hot.Made Quarry Gap at 1630 ---- 7.5 miles in about 4 hours.
Gizmo (Colorado) and Firetrekker (Ohio) were in already. Grant, a young flip-flop thru hiker came in at 1730. Dinner, water and set the sleep stuff. Then sit and talk until dark. Same old, same old, everyday.

Drove to Boiling Springs to ATC regional office for a parking permit. Parking lot is crammed full of trout fisher persons. Apparently trout season is also in. Big business here. Found a spot and got back to downtown for lunch and new piece of gear. Big Agnes air pad wider than my Neo Air. Maybe I won't slide off for a change.Picked up by my second shuttle guy and back to PGFSP to start northbound again.
Weather is great, blue skies, 60s, light winds. Got down to a short sleeve shirt and no leggings for hiking today. Trail out of the park was graded. Then uphill for a mile or so followed by the usual rock piles, etc.. No hard climbs today. Boring scenery again.
Got to James Fry at 1630 and set about getting ready for tonight. First thing found out that the new air pad was packaged with the wrong size. Box and bag were correct, but pad was 5-inches too narrow. Called the outdoors store and told them I would be in Wednesday to get the correct pad. In the mean time, I will be using this one since I ditched the hammock gear for the next 2 days to avoid the rain issues that will be here tomorrow and Wednesday.

Overcast and rain coming. Quick breakfast and packed for 3 substantial ridges and a couple of smaller ones.
The new air mattress was great even though it was the wrong size. More on that later. First ridge was a long steady ride, maybe 500 feet. Second ridge was a butt kicker due to steep grade. On top was a pair of ""rock mazes"". Generally a place that required hands, knees, feet, poles, and a strong desire to punish yourself. One of the hardest areas I have found over the last several years. Can't wait for the ""real"" rocks of PA to show up further north.
Anyway, made the remaining climbs and downs with no problems other than using a lot of energy. Last roughly 1.7 miles through fields. PA farmers are spreading highly aromatic animal waste on the fields. Unfortunately, I was down wind in this area. Tractor drivers were in enclosed cabs with full air going or they would have choked to death.Made Boiling Springs around 1330 and dumped my junk in the truck to rest awhile. Had already called and arranged a hostel for tonight to miss the rain--- I hope! Did a little shopping for lunch food. Turkey sandwich (appropriate for this mornings mess) and Gatorade. Got some nannas and pop tarts to top off the meal.
Back to the air mattress. Returned to the outfitters with said item in hand. Lady at the counter yells to the back - hey, the guy with the Big Agnes is here. The whole store apparently knew my story. To make it short, someone, somewhere had packaged the wrong pads in two different boxes. Got it straight and returned said ""used"" mattress.
Dinner at the Boiling Springs Tavern. Appropriate beverages consumed.Road trip to hostel where clothes from all of last 7 days got done and all gizmos recharged. Rain started at 1800. Tomorrow maybe a rain delay again - just when I had caught back up to my schedule. It is the trail - deal with it!","James Fry Shelter

Afterward I drove over to Carlisle, PA to see if I could catch Johnny Walker and Bangles for lunch. Could not make contact. They may have gone back to the trail.Carlilsle is home to the U.S. Army War College. Passed thru the gate and did a little shopping at the commissary for odds and ends. Headed downtown to a local bookstore but could find nothing I wanted to read. Passed by Dickinson College right in middle of town. Cool looking campus. Headed out of town stopping to get gas and could not find my wallet. Last known spot was going to the bookstore. Headed back up the street and saw it lying in street where I had been parked. Miracles happen - thank you Lord for looking out for this fool.Got some lunch at Red Robin in Carlilsle and headed back to the hostel. Afternoon was lazy, reading, catching up journal, and re-packing my gear for tomorrow. Long day ahead as we have to do the 15 miles across the Cumberland Valley since there is no camping in that stretch. 
I am reading Earl Shaffer's book ""Walking With Spring"". He was 1st person to thru hike the AT in 1948. Also read Gene Espy's book ""The Trail of My Life"". Cordele, GA fellow who was the 2nd person to thru hike the AT in 1951. Very interesting to compare their experiences then versus the current trail location and gear they'd used.

Left Boiling Springs at 0720. Moved across the Cumberland Valley with ease. Had the one climb out of 500 feet to make Darlington Sheter at 1330 ( 14.7 miles). Decided it was too early to call it a day so pushed on to the next shelter 7.3 miles. The climb up the front side of Cove Mtn was a straight up steady grade. Took a while. Rocks started at far end of the Mtn and lasted to the shelter 2.7 miles ahead. Cove Mtn looks like a horseshoe, twisted upon itself. Apparently a geologic anticline with the center of the arch eroded away leaving a cove between the 2 arms of the Mtn. Made it in around 1700. 
Highlights today: 4 squirrels, 1 fat groundhog running like crazy to beat me to his/her hole in a fence row, 7 or 8 shots from 12 ga ( guy was doing a pattern on his turkey gun by his house), numerous birds, and no cows chasing me across pastures!","Boiling Springs, PA

Got down to Duncannon to vicinity of the ""fabulous"" , now not so famous Doyle Hotel, by 0900. Called my shuttle guy for pick up and he arrived right around 1000.

Stopped for a snack at the state park parking area at this gap and had a good conversation with a volunteer who was manning the entrance. Crossed the river(?) and headed for next climb up 2nd Mountain. Coming down I met Johnny Walker and Bangles who were headed northbound still. 
Weather was getting heavy by the time I reach Rausch Gap and crossed the stream on an old rail bed . Unique solution to acid mine drainage from old coal mines in the area. River diverted thru a series of limestone wells to change overall pH of downstream waters. Installed by Trout Unlimited. 
Just as I reached the shelter the rains let loose. JB and his 10? year old daughter were already in. This place became a city by dark. Three in tents up the road. Two more came in for an overnighter, with more of their friends on the way. Scout troop and five more camped up the road behind the privy location.

They are still northbound.Took a 20 minute break at Clarks Creek (325 parking lot) and watched folks trout fishing. Then the long climb of the day - about 800 feet. Peter's Mountain was a challenge due to one long steady grade with no switchbacks. Just about killed me - again! But I made it and headed for the roller coaster of bumps, rock ridges, and swales. Temps began to drop with wind chill in the 40s. Wind did not let up from the west slope all afternoon.Met a young couple headed toward Peters Mtn shelter. They had one baby in a carrier, one toddler walking, and two other kids - 5, 6, or 7?. Man was overloaded and then had to carry the toddler. Should not have been on this trail, not prepared for the hike or spending the night. They never made the shelter so we all hoped they had turned around and gone back to the parking lot.Shelter almost got full, plus 4 more in tents. Wind howled all night.

West wind was bitter for 2 hours until sun began to take over. Lots of the continuing saga of bumps, piles, crests, and Swales. Finally hit the big stuff toward end of Peters Mtn around 0900. Lots of scrambling to get thru the upturned mess of quartzites. PANGEA LIVES HERE! Thank you Africa and Europe. (for those not familiar with geology, Pangea is the super continent formed when all the continents collided roughly 270 millions years ago.)
Made the turn downhill at Clarks Ferry Shelter at 1100 - 6.7 miles in 3 hours. Not bad for an old goat. Downhill to the Sesquehanna River crossing was another thrill off the steep slope with lots of step downs.Got to the Doyle Hotel downtown at 1330 for a burger and beer.

Sunny day with temps in the 80s. Down right hot. Rocks and washouts over most of today's trail. Lots of stick ups making it hard to find a place for your foot to fit between. Guess this is practice for the ""real rocks"" waiting further north. Got a picture looking from Shikellamy Overlook from the eastern side of Blue Mtn. A really nice stream at Mill Creek flowing into an old power dam that operated as a small hydro. Used to be an old scout camp in the area.

It was already near 80 degrees and I needed to climb 1050 feet to get to the top of Blue Mtn. A long, slow climb ensued. Took a lot of short breaks as my lungs still have not caught up to the need. Stopped at Outerbridge Shelter for a 20 minute rest around 1030. High sun, blue skies, some wind and a long slog to the remainder of the crest. Trail was smooth in a lot of the section so I made reasonably good time. A couple more 15 to 20 minute breaks before I got to Leigh Furnace Gap and the gravel road at a communications tower. Oh Joy! After leaving the road I ran into a huge rock pile (boulders) going straight up the slope of Blue Mtn. ""Moving on up to the west side"" and finding more boulder piles. Two more before I got to clean trail and reached the shelter at 1415. Megan and Matt (previously met from further south) walked in at the same time. We are all beat down from the heat and rocks.

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589066,"Rain last night and strong winds had me re-setting my tarp twice to keep the blowing rain out. Finally got to sleep at 2100. Awoke to clear skies and reasonably cool temps. Jumped off at 0700 since today is ""rock climbing"" day. And did it ever!First up, a nice trail for a mile then the boulder climb to Bake Oven Knob - about a half mile. More semi-nice trail then another pile going straight up the ""Knife Edge"". A thrill a minute using hands, knees, feet, and poles to scramble thru tilting ledges - pictures to follow! Down and thru some more rock stumbles until another pile to Bears Rock. Finally got some decent trail from there to Hwy 309. About normal speed of two mph, even with the rocks. That shows how good the other sections were. From 309 the trail was an old woods road for next 4 miles to Allentown Shelter - a stroll in the woods. Made the shelter at 1215, even after talking to 2 or 3 other hikers along the way.Sun came out at 1200 to ""warm"" the afternoon. Had already decided to stop here and do a bigger day tomorrow so that I can get into Port Clinton by Sunday.Other than rock piles, no significant events today. A few folks drifted by during the afternoon. At 1800, 8 other weekend campers came in and setup down the hill.Looks like a party but rain is coming.","Bake Oven Knob Shelter

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589331,"Sunrise was at 0630 over the far ridge. Found a trail magic item when I rolled out of the quilt. Kyle (one of last nights party) had left me a hand-carved small dog. Wrote a note to thank him and made breakfast. Needed a quick start as I needed to get to Windsor Furnace Shelter to shorten tomorrow's hike for shuttle pick up at 1000.
A long day with several ""rock hops"" ahead. Got thru Dan's Pulpit at 0930. Took a couple of pics to the east showing location of the Pinnacle. Rocks on the trail again, maybe more so than usual. Stopped at Eckville Shelter for a snack and water. This shelter is in a guy's backyard - strange. Then a long grade but on a PA game lands road to top of ridge leading to the Pinnacle. Began to see more folks out for a Saturday hike, all heading to Pinnacle. Got there at 1350. Added my rock to the pile folks have created at entrance to Pinnacle - about 15 high and 20 feet across. Took the requisite pics of next ridge across the valley where ""The Pulpit"" rock resides. Large crowd of day hikers coming up from south side - kids, babies, little kids, teenagers, dogs, and us old folks. None of them know trail rules. Reached the ""Pulpit"" at 1450 and got some more required pics. Finally, thru the last rock piles and downhill to Windsor Furnace, with piles of folks heading down also.
Made the shelter at 1600 and flopped in - dead tired. Cooked supper, laid out my bed and pulled out the iPod for some tunes. Two hours later I'm rolling over for some zzzzzzzs.","Allentown Shelter

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589333,"Rained last night a few times. Needed to be at Port Clinton by 0930 - 1000 for my shuttle.Got out early at 0650 and headed out in the overcast for a couple of ups and downs before the ""big"" down. Slick rocks and wet leaves made for an interesting hike. Mostly good trail until I got to the end of the Hogback - then rocks again. Interesting thing happened there, the beds were perfectly flat lying. Looks like the mountain was rolled over instead of beds standing at a high angle. Very unusual for here. Drizzle on and off for a while. Got to the big down at 0900 and dove off the mountain. Well not exactly "" dove"" but sure seemed like it with the slope. Much like the opposite side of Port Clinton's NOBO slope.
Arrived at 0925 and shuttle arrived at 0945. Good timing for both of use. Allen and I worked out well. He was in 82nd Airborne in early 1980's and participated in 307th Engr Bn bridge demolition at Falls Lake reservoir before it was filled. I was a safety engineer on the same demo exercise. Those guys parachuted into the empty reservoir and humped all their gear to the various bridges. Amazing coincidence that we meet here 30 years later.
Arrived at Church of The Mountain Hostel around 1200. Said goodby to Allen and went to pizza Resturant for a burger and fries. Matt and Megan arrived while I was gone. They are in for 2 nights to re-supply and rest. Five others were also in. Dinner and a shower made for a good Nero Day.","Windsor Furnace Shelter

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589466,"Slept late - up at 0800. Headed down to the Apple Pie Bakery in the Gap for a breakfast sandwich. Nothing else open. I' m late getting started. Left the hostel at 0900. First thing I run into another one of those Roads Scholars groups on an outing. They made a path to let me thru and we chatted for a minute. 20 to 25 folks heading up a nasty climb - nasty in the sense it is 1000 feet to the top for an overlook of the Delaware River and Gap. Did not wait around to see how many made it to the top. Another long day ahead meant I had to push hard to set up tomorrow's hike. This section from DWG to Leigh Gap is 36 miles. I need to be there by noon Wednesday. Took a couple of pics from top of ridge overlooking the DWG and then some more further on that showed the river heading downstream.Took a break after 2 hours where there was good trail and better mileage. Got into the rocks and things slowed down immensely. Made Kirkridge Shelter just after 1200 and went for water. No other water for 13 miles until Leroy Smith Shelter which I could not make today. Moving on into more ""rocks"". Climbed up Wolf Rocks and back down. Not as bad as was led to believe since most of the pile was slabs lying fairly flat. Easy hopping around and off the mess. THEN the trail got really bad. Rocks, rocks, rocks, more rocks for about 3 miles. No place to put your foot, except on or between rocks.
Found a camping spot about a mile north of Wind Gap and called it a day at 1600. Feet are hurting today from the hard stepping and fetching. Got out the hammock and cooled my tootsies for a while. Light, cold dinner as I need to conserve water for breakfast. More tunes tonight to keep the boogers away!!!","Delaware Water Gap

Need to be within 6 miles of Leigh Gap so that I can get on the road home on Wednesday.Awoke at 0530 and laid around until 0700. Quick breakfast and packed by 0730. Checked the area and loaded out for moving at 0745. Next water is 5 miles away at Leroy Smith Shelter. Some good trail this morning and the usual rocks elsewhere. Got in to Smith Shelter at 1000 to find Tweats there. She had fallen on Saturday and had a black eye. Since be re-named ""Brusier"". Chatted a while then got water and rested for 30 minutes. Trail got more rocky and kept switching sides of the mountain - PUUDS. Stopped at noon for a 30 minute respite at a road crossing. Then on to Delps Trail where there is a spring 0.4 miles down the Mtn. Did not go for water. As I was leaving, Happy Hermit came up the trail. We meet again for about the 5th or 6th time in last 2 weeks. Got his website address so that I can follow his progress on his thru hike. Pushed on at 1430 to reach a stealth site near Low Gap. Found said spot at 1600 and pitched in for the night. About 1 mile north of Low Gap.
Today the following folks passed by me again heading northbound: Brusier, Penguin, Old & Slow, Bobcat, Happy Hermit, and last OB.","Somewhere Near Wind Gap

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589705,"Last day on this section. Git-r-Done!Had a good night even with a short water ration. Done, packed, and moved out at 0700. Down the rock pile to Low Gap and up the smaller pile on the other side. Lots of walking along the west side of Blue Mtn. Many views of the mined areas and Superfund site remediation in the valley. New Jersey Zinc smelted zinc ores in the area from 1890 until 1980. Denuded a lot of the vegetation on Blue Mtn and surrounding areas. Reason for the Superfund Site. Heavy metals everywhere from the process. Got some pictures of the mined areas, tailings piles and process plants. Old plants side by side with the remediation process.
Crested the top of Blue Mtn heading to the high rock ridge on the Leigh Gap face of Blue Mtn and took a snack break at 0945. Time finally came to jump off the ""pile"". Not so much a trail as a Goat path. Glad I was not climbing up with 3 days food and 2 days water. Also glad I have had some rock climbing experience. Came in handy trying to find finger and toe holds in the shear ledge drop offs. Lots of hand work to get through safely. Took a couple of pictures of the rock type and slope.
Made the river crossing at 1025 and the truck at the Leigh Valley Nature Center at 1030. Took a bath at the rear of my truck ( top side only) using 1 quart of water and a pack towel. Semi-clean clothes in the truck were a blessing as I stunk/stank after 3 days of woods travel in the heat.
Loaded the junk and hit the road at 1100 after calling our Army son (Thomas) to wish him a Happy Birthday.

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589948,"Spent Wednesday night in Daleville, VA after leaving Leigh Gap at 1030. Another 7.5 hours on the I-slabs and thankfully no issues on the southbound ride got me home Thursday at 1545. Another section in the books.
A review and some notes on the hike are in order. Generally, the sections of Maryland and Pennsylvania were somewhat boring, even though the famous ""PA Rocks"" were encountered over significant areas. The AT for the most part is only made enjoyable by the people you meet. On this trip I made new friends and met some old friends.
This is the first time I have used a vehicle to try and make hiking easier. I set the truck ahead for each 50 to 60 mile segment so that I could re-supply about the mid-point, i.e. each 2 to 3 day hike. This allowed me to cut weight for food and clothes, helping me to move somewhat faster than in previous hikes. The folks who provided shuttles for me to collect and move the truck were excellent and deserve a special thanks: (Robert Freeman; Michael Gelinas; Joyce Carlin; Craig at Rock-n-Sole Hostel; and Allen Wejkszner)
The AT in Maryland is maintained by the PATC (Potomac AT Club). There had been a lot of trail maintenance prior to my arrival. Many trees from winter storms had been cleared and the trail was in good shape. Thanks to those folks for the work they do. The weather was another matter. Met up with a couple of guys in Harper's Ferry and we hiked for several days. The second night was a gut buster of a storm. After that there were 4 days of small sleet pellets, tiny snowflakes, and drizzle with temps in the 40's. Finally reached Pen Mar on the 18th and collected my truck to shuttle both guys to Waynesboro where they decided to go home. Lost 2 hiker buddies but gained 2 more on the 19th as I was leaving Pen Mar (Johnny Walker and Bangles).
Hiking in PA turned out to be 2 different hikes. The first roughly hundred miles is pleasant and much like Maryland. The second hundred or so is different with the rock issues. The Pennsylvania section is maintained by several ATC clubs. Some sections were in good shape but other areas were in need of tree clearing and brush removal. Poison ivy was beginning to sprout in many areas and will need clearing. Long pants are the call for now, or suffer the itch and rash. It is early in the hiker season so I imagine the work will get done soon. I know this is difficult work and the terrain here does not make it any easier. Kudos to those who help keep the trail open and usable.
Passing the Mason-Dixon Line on the 19th, we (JW and Bangles) traveled off and on together for 2 to 3 weeks. Sometimes going northbound and sometimes I was southbound passing them on several different sections. I also had a couple days rest at Pine Grove Furnace State Park on the 21st/22nd to attend a hammock hang. My first MAHHA hang with about 100 folks. Great dinner, gear raffle, and talking with old friends and some new ones also. Back to the trail on the 22nd and moved back to Fayetteville, PA to collect my vehicle.
After Hwy 309, Pennsylvania brings the ""famous"" PA Rocks. Sometimes the trail is completely covered in stones and boulders. Many ""stick-ups"" (those still attached to Mother Earth) and the other stones make for difficult walking as you need to watch virtually every foot placement. It can be slow going at times. The larger ridges, piles, and up lifts were not that difficult and not as bad as I was led to believe.  There was one exception - the north face of Blue Mountain at Leigh Gap. Now that was a goat trail with rock climbing required in some sections.  Dangerous but still exciting.
I normally travel at about 2 mph on most trails that are in good shape and do not have severe climbs or other issues.  On this trip I probably averaged the 2 mph, but there were areas where 1 to 1.5 mph were the norm.  Other areas allowed faster travel up to as much as 3 mph.  Crossing the Cumberland Valley farm lands was really a joy, while the rocks north of Hwy 309 were a royal pain and frustrating at times.  It seems that the AT has been placed in many places that are worthless from a cultural viewpoint, as well as for hiking by the average citizen.  Northern PA is one of those places.
Over the last week or so, I met with my friends for a few days stay at the Rock-n-Sole Hostel near Schyullkill, PA.  This is by far the best hostel I have had the pleasure to visit over several years of hiking.  The owners are friendly and helpful, the hostel is clean and comfortable and located at a convenient spot near the trail.  Craig and Jody are excellent hosts. The shuttles were great.  I rate this hostel as 5-Star from my perspective.  Sometimes they slack-packed and I did a southbound, meeting them along the trail before returning to the hostel for the night.  I used southbound hikes to help offset the truck movements, as on those days I could hike immediately after getting to the new location versus shuttling back south and wasting the whole day.
I used both my hammock and shelters for this trip.  As on other parts of the AT, the shelters range from fairly new in good shape to those ancient structures that need replacement.  Both states have some of each.  Two in particular deserve special mention for their truly good conditions:  Tumbling Run, and Quarry Run .  These are maintained by caretakers who have dedicated their lives to helping hikers enjoy a nice place to stop.  Both are in excellent condition and are well kept.  ATC needs to step up and start replacements all along the trail.  It appears a lot of money and effort is dedicated to protecting the trail corridor but not so much in maintaining the structures and managing safety/risks along the trail.
I used a new boot for this section hike - Hoka One One. These turned out to be a great choice for me.  The uppers are a soft leather that stretched when needed, especially in the toe box.  This prevented toe issues, especially on steep downhills.  The soles are a soft Vibram that had a spring/yield when encountering the rocks.  This allowed the boot to flex and the foot to have a soft landing, versus the hard pounding normally associated with stiff soles.  A couple of pictures show that they survived extremely well considering the number of toe trips, bumps, and scraps that were encountered over the 265 or so miles on this trip.  I think a couple of dabs of silicone will solve the minor separation at the toe where the rand comes up the front of the boot.  The insoles were replaced with a Dr. Scholls Active insole which gave a good cushion to the foot.
And last but not least, the climb down the north side of Leigh Gap was a thrill.  So glad I have had rock climbing experience to call on for this drop off.  I suspect the climb up would not be as dangerous since the pack weight will be behind and lower than when coming down.  A more manageable situation in most instances.  You choose which way you want to experience this rock pile.
Finally, thanks to all those I met on the trail for their encouragement and help.  People are what make the trail.  Not the trail itself.","Home
