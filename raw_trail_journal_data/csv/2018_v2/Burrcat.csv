Burrcat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583226,"Heavenly FatherAs you are aware, I am working toward a start date of March 17, 2018. My route will be a bit unconventional, as I plan to flip flop a couple of times. I will start my thru hike in Damascus, Va. hiking south to Springer Mountain. The plan is to arrive in Georgia in time to celebrate my grand daughter's first birthday. From Springer Mountain I'll head to Harper's Ferry W.Va., and hike south to Damascus, Va. And, to finish my hike, I'll travel to Maine and hike south to Harper's Ferry.My prayer is that you will bless my hike. Keep me strong and healthy. I ask that every person that comes within my sight can sense your presence. Make this an unforgettable experience for me and co-hikers.I pray that you will keep a watchful eye over my family as I take on this adventure. Keep them safe, happy and healthy.It is in Jesus' name I pray.",,View Entry,"Feb 22, Thu",0

Thank you for such a beautiful day today. I was so motivated, that I loaded up my pack; filled up my water bladder; grabbed my trekking poles and set out on a 7 mile conditioning hike with full pack. It hurt! Thank you for the pain. Now I know where I stand as far as conditioning is concerned. My date of departure is three weeks away. I pray for continued improvement in my conditioning. I know tomorrow will be better. Give me the mental strength to grow and improve.",,View Entry,"Feb 25, Sun",0

Conditioning hurts. Thank you for the feedback, I know it's for my own good. Please give me the strength and determination to get through this. You know the age and condition of this body. Help me stay motivated so that I reach a level of fitness that will allow me to not just ""go for it"" but will allow me to conquer the Damascus to Springer Mtn. section of the trail.
Thank you for your blessings.

Today was a good day for my hiking, but sad in that Billy Graham was buried today. Thank you God for his 99 years. 
I did hike with full pack and it felt like I hiked with full pack. I know my strength and endurance are getting better. My plan to reach Springer by 4/23 may be a little aggressive. So, please give me the drive to get it done. 
Thank you again for my family, friends, health and blessings beyond my words.

With family in for  the weekend, I didn't get a lot of hiking in. Instead, I watched my grandson (Ellis) play in a soccer tournament. His new nickname is ""Splash"". You know the details. Thank you for the family I have. I couldn't be more proud! Give me the strength to endure being away for 463 miles of hiking.

Burrcat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583978,"Heavenly FatherI've worked hard this last week, as I quickly approach my departure date. I've been doing longer hikes with a full pack (27 lbs.).The weather has turned cold and wet, not what I was hoping for. I'd appreciate temperatures in the 50s and no rain for the first week. My faith is bigger than a mustard seed (Matthew 17:20), so I'm counting on it to get me up and over a few mountains next week. Thank you Lord for all things. Even the rain and cold, for I know all things work together for good (Romans 8:28).In Jesus name",,View Entry,"Mar 12, Mon",0
Burrcat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584079,"Heavenly Father,This week my preparation focused on getting my head around the fact that my departure date is Saturday. Business dealings this week took me to Charleston, SC where I worked with the pros at Armada Development, great people taking my business partners and I on a fantastic journey. Thank you for the team.Tomorrow I make a final visit to REI, Charlotte. Picking up a few odds and ends...needed more weight.In Jesus name,",,View Entry,"Mar 13, Tue",0

Burrcat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585452,"FatherThank you for this day and those since my last entry.As I've struggled with a knee issue since this adventure started I have to end it well short of my goal of Athens by late April. My problem is going down hill. Even with the assistance of trekking poles, it hurt and slowed me to the point that I need to re-think my adventure. This is a let down to me. I really struggled with stopping, but I know it was the best thing to do.Regardless of the success or failure of my journey, I'm thankful for the time we spent together on my short journey.In Jesus name,","
