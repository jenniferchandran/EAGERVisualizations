First shelter night was at the Hurricane Mountain shelter with Chef from New Hampshire. Just to show the difference, I was hoping for a 14.5 mile day while he was planning a 20 mile day. 

Tent camped by myself near a stream day 7. Perfect camping weather, only issue was I had to get on the trail the next morning. 

Resupplied in Marion day 8.  Great small town where everybody knows everybody, and they all welcome hikers.  Was waiting for the shuttle to take me back to the trail when Jim Sparks drives up and asks if I want a lift.  Turns out his son thru-hiked in 2014 and was so well treated by people, his father now spends a lot of time just helping hikers.

The White's have been the subject of talk for most of the hike, and I must say, they have lived up to their reputation.  While both physically and mentally tiring, they also have some amazing views.  I hope to post some photos today if wi-fi holds up. Like most folks my mileage dropped in the mountains so my choice of using the huts when possible definitely was a good one.  (Thanks to Steve P for the suggestion)  Speaking of huts, I probably should explain these unique facilities. The Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) runs eight mountain huts that can have from 36 -95 bunks and a seasonal crew to provide breakfast and dinner to hikers. While nice, they are still sparse. Generally no hot water, no showers, composting toilets, and common dorm like sleeping. Except for one or two helicopter deliveries per year, all the food/supplies are packed in by the crew. All in all a hut is a very welcome sight at the end of a hard hike. As this entry is named the Presidentials's, it would be wrong not to discuss the range of 4000 foot peaks in the White's. Basically a string of peaks mostly above trendline, many folks have a goal of climbing all the 4000 footers including the ones named for the Presidents.  The AT crosses a couple of the Presidents, but I wasn't sorry to miss Jefferson and Adams on a wet and cold day. Unfortunately, my summit of Mount Washington was on a typical day, cloudy and rainy, but I do have some great pre-summit photos of Washington from the day before when it was clear. Mount Washington really is worth a Google search given its unique weather making ability.  All that being said, I will finish New Hampshire this week and start on Maine.

I think I can confirm they definitely make you work for the finish especially the middle two miles of rock scramble and in some cases hand over hand climbing. Completed the day with a pizza and beer party to celebrate six finishes and my turn to the South.  I don't want to skip the miles before Katahdin. While not hard compared to the White's, the 100 Mile Wilderness is not a cake walk, but you are rewarded everyday with lakes and views that make the roots and rocks worth it as you can see by the photos.  I will be double zeroing in Bangor, ME waiting for my flight and for Florence to clear out of VA/NC/TN.  The National Parks should have reopened when I start hiking South on Saturday and hopefully, the mud and blowdowns won't be too bad. The good news is there are definitely fewer rocks and roots.   Damascus to Springer Mountain is 470 miles so estimated completion is plus or minus 1 Nov.","Logan Brook Road

We spent the night at Red and Pat's place in Danville. Thanks Pat for a great stay. Departed Damascus heading South on Saturday the 22nd. Three days and forty-two miles later I am in Hampton, TN at the Boots Off Hostel. Lot fewer folks on the trail going Southbound. Only 428 more miles to Springer. I do seem to be paying for all the good weather in NH and Maine with rain down South.  Had to leave the Tramily at Katahdin, but hiked the last two days with Steffan, a retired IT guy from Chicago and Princess, a retired City of San Diego person.","Damascus, VA

Low Gear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603653,"Knocked out 34 miles in two days. Good hiking on the Tennessee Express. The best news is I saw my first bears on Tuesday. A Mama bear and three cubs.  Looked like the cubs had their battle drill down. Saw me and headed for a tree. Half way up, Mama bear called an audible and the pack headed over the top of the hill. Of course, my phone was in my pocket in a water proof bag so no pictures were taken. No that I have seen bears and moose, time to finish the last 394 miles.","Hampton, TN

Low Gear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604024,"Sorry about the delay in entries. Was enjoying the trail and hostels so much, I forgot to update the blog. As you can see by the mileage, I am now under 300 miles until Springer Mountain. Had a good week of relatively decent miles and great weather. Got a little slack packing in as well. Worst part was a technical issue or more directly, my phone reset itself and while most things were restored via backup, the contact list did not fully recover so I am attempting to rebuild it manually. Stayed at two hostels, the Greasy Creek Friendly and Natures Inn.  Hostels really help break up the hike. Will be in Hot Springs, NC this weekend and start the Great Smoky National Park Thursday or Friday.","The Station Hostel

Low Gear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604488,"As you can see from the title, I have started the Smoky Mountain National Park. Three days in, I am resupplying in Gatlinburg before the final three days ending at Fontana Dam on Wednesday. With a little dawdling I managed to dodge the Hurricane Michael weather except for a couple of hours of light rain. Thoughts are with the folks in the Panahhandle as they recover from the storm. Michael has appeared to push the fair weather here into history. Temps dropped 20 degrees literally overnight and the forecast says the low temps are here to stay. Last night was 43 and next week is projecting the 30s. I am thankful for my Enlightened Equipment camping quilt and my Big Agnes insulated sleeping pad. I did have another bear sighting on Thursday. Another mama bear with just a single cub this time. Managed to get a photo this time. Back on the trail tomorrow with a climb up Clingman's Dome, the highest point on the AT at 6658 feet.","Jones Meadow

Done with the Smoky's plus two days to the NOC. Marine Vet hiking partner joined me at Fontana Dam for four days of fun in the not so Sun.  Would say we are kicking butt and taking names except two women in their sixties, one with two fake knees, walked away and left us in their dust yesterday.  As mentioned, weather becoming a factor.  Two days in the 20s will test our resolve.  Passed the 2000 mile mark on Tuesday so the short timers calender is in motion.","Gatlinburg

Taking a Zero (no hiking miles) today a the Top of Georgia Hostel.  Projected rain most of the day and I am fighting the first cold of my hike. Will hike out tomorrow and am still projected to finish by 1 Nov. Had some great hiking the last five days. Two with my Marine Vet hiking partner and three on my own. Slept in the Albert Mountain fire tower and had a great sunset, a huge moon, and a super sunrise as you can see from the photos. Shared the tower with a guy living on 1200 calorie survival rations dipped in peanut butter, no thanks. Weather continues to test resolve.  Had my afternoon Snickers Bar snack yesterday and it broke off like I had just taken it out of the freezer. With the high being 49 the next two days, I will get to practice my layering skills. Also climber my last 5000 footer yesterday so I guess it is all downhill from here.","Natasha Outdoor Center

Low Gear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605003,"Before we get to the ""Finish"" portion, there were more days in the week than just today. I am sure NOBO hikers have a hard time appreciating the trail in Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee, but as a Flip Flopper coming from New England, the relatively smooth and fast trail is awesome. Great stop at Mountain Crossings in Neel Gap. A bunk, shower, and pizza for $20 can't be beat. Great weather the last three days as I traversed the Training area for the Mountain Phase of Ranger School. Heard helicopters and firing so I know Rangers were training. With the weather and Fall, the trail is generally uncrowded except on the weekends. The last two night I tented near shelters, but was the only person there. Now I did have a mouse visitor in my tent the first night. Not sure what he was after since there was no food in the tent.  I took mercy on him and merely chased him out of my house, but I did not appreciate the hole he chewed in my tent. All that being said, I did finish my thru-hike on 1 Nov at Springer Mountain, GA. It was a gray day, but I beat the rain to the Summit. Still getting used to the idea that tomorrow or the day after, I don't have to pull on my boots and hike 15 miles. A great journey, a great trail community, and many great friends made over the past six months. Thanks to those who followed my adventure, you are also part of the trail community.","Top of Georgia Hostel
