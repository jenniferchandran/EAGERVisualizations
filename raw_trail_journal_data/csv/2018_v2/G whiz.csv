G whiz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583720,"I am attempting a thru-hikeTo go on an adventure 

To challenge my physical abilities

To be a nomad

To prove to myself I can do it

To seek inner peace and solitude

To assess the next chapter of my life

To take a step outside of regular life and reflect

As a tribute to my mother who always wanted to go on a spiritual quest as the Native Americans call it",,View Entry,"Mar 06, Tue",0
G whiz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583722,"A favorite poem
There is an art to wandering.

If I have a destination,

A plan-an objective-I’ve lost the ability to find serendipity.

I’ve become too focused, too single-minded. I am on a quest,

not a ramble. I search for the Holy Grail of particularity and

miss the chalice freely offered, 

filled and overflowing.

G whiz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585517,"I started today around 8:30 am at Front Royal, VA (936 ft elevation) where my best friend Charles (thank you!) dropped me off.  The weather all day was nice, starting at 49 degrees and getting up to 59 degrees, overcast, and little to no wind. Around 1:30 pm, I arrived at the Jim and Molly Denton Shelter (1,306 ft elevation) where I will be spending the night.  The soreness in my hips, back, and knees are definitely showing that no amount of gym time can quite prepare you for hiking with 43 lbs on your back :). I'm a little worried about my right knee, which I've been struggling with for a little while.5.7 miles - 13,144 steps - 22 flights climbed","Front Royal, VA

G whiz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585582,"Last night was rainy. I slept at the Jim & Molly Denton Shelter and was the only one there. After I left the shelter this morning, everything was wet and muddy. Unfortunately on my first downhill section, I lost my footing and slipped, torquing my good knee. I believe that I caused a minor injury to either my ACL or MCL. Either injury requires medical attention and I had to leave the trail. I am resting at an Econolodge in Charlottesville, VA for the day, and I will be taking a train back home to Ohio where I will get my knee checked by my doctor. To say I’m disappointed would be an understatement.","Jim & Molly Denton Shelter

G whiz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596777,"I saw an orthopedic surgeon who did an MRI that revealed that I had ruptured my ACL.  Because of the type of injury, it does not require surgery. However, I will need six weeks of physical therapy and wear a custom-made knee brace that prevents lateral movement of the knee. He also said that there is a 50-50 chance of reinjuring which would require surgery. To better my odds of not reinjuring, he suggests that I wear the knee brace anytime that I am hiking where there is a steep incline or decent as most of the A.T. is.  I plan to continue/ restart my hike in Harper’s Ferry going south toward the end of August after moving my daughter to college.",,View Entry,"Jun 10, Sun",0
