Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584506,"Over the last week I have started getting all my gear finalized and settled.  It's been a challenge trying to figure out which gear I really need, but I'll figure that out during the course of the AT hike.  Yesterday, I called all my mail drop locations to make sure they were still in business.  People on the other line gave me tips on how to send a mail drop.  The one lady from Fontana Dam near the smokey mountains said ""You'd be surprised how many people don't put their name on their package!""  A lodge owner in Maine said that sometimes the ETA date gets confused with the zip code and the package ends up on the other side of the country.  Hopefully that doesn't happen to any of my packages.  Tomorrow Theresa, Patrick, and I will start driving out to Atlanta which is two hours south of Springer Mountain.  We'll make an overnight stop in Jackson, Mississippi on the way.  It's almost here!!!",,View Entry,"Mar 20, Tue",0
Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584865,"What a day today. Patrick, Theresa, and, I woke up a little late this morning after a filled day of venturing around Atlanta.  We headed out to Amicalola Falls State Park to start the AT approach trail.   The approach trail is 8.5 miles from Springer Mountain.  The southern terminus of the AT.  The park office provided an initial introduction to the trail and what one should pack to for all the types of weather while hiking in the mountains.  It can be anywhere from sunny to full on freezing rain and snow.  They showed us how to do a PCT bear bag hang since the AT bears have figured out how to take down a traditional bear hang.  They learned by watching us hang it.  
Our trek started with a picture in front of the approach trail entrance.  I first saw this entrance in a book called lost on the Appalachian Trail.  In the picture it was the author and his girlfriend.  I found it fitting to have a picture with Theresa.  I was sad to say goodbye, since it won't be a little while before I see her again.  We plan to m meet up in Virginia about 600 miles into my hike, hopefully sooner.
The approach trail starts out on flat, but soon it shoots up near the falls about 600 steps straight up.  It's not bad when you just hike for the day but with a 35 pound pack it definitely gets your heart racing.  Patrick and I were asked several times if we were doing the whole thing.  Everyone wished us well on our journey.  After the falls, the trail was mostly up and down for 6 miles.  It's going to be like that for the next 2200 miles.  They say this trail is harder than the PCT and Continental divide because of all the hills. We were definitely feeling that today.  We made it to the first shelter but decided to call it a day before summiting to the top.  We didn't want to get to the top during the night which would have been an anticlimactic way to start the AT.  I'm now listening to the pitter patter of rain on my tent.  The forecast says it going to rain over the next week.  I'm looking forward to it.","Amicalola Falls
",1.5 miles from Springer Mountain,"Mar 24, Sat",7
Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584975,"For our very first night on the trail the rain poured.  There was so much, that puddles formed around my tent as lightning lit up the sky. I was a bit worried that I would soon be in a lake. It slowed late in the night and the water luckily receded.  In the morning, the outside of my tent was a mess with little flecks of dirt everywhere.  Patrick was in the same boat.  We both said that we should have tried out the shelter instead.
It was a slow start to the day since because we had to pack up a wet mess, but we made it to the top of Springer Mountain!  Patrick and I opened a celebratory peacemaker at the top.  It was the best tasting beer over the whole week.  We split some cheese and bread that really hit the spot.
A little way down from the summit was the Springer Mountain shelter. There we met a guy named Overkill.  He had this dolly type contraption that hauled 100 pounds.  He even let me try it out.  I don't know why someone would need that much weight unless you were not expecting a resupply for several days.  He told us a story about the time he tried to outrun a bush fire only to submerge himself underwater while the fire blazed right near his face.  You don't know who you'll meet on the trail.
We had our first instance of trail magic!  A trail runner was taking counts of how many people were hiking through.  He was giving out rice Krispy treats and little hugs (not actual hugs but the little juices).  It was a highlight after coming down from a mountain.
The trail felt like a rain forest, it was misty, damp, and really green.  Spring hasn't really started yet in the foothills.  After 5 hours of hiking we made it to camp after 9.6 miles of hiking.  I'm lying in my tent as I hear wind starting to wreak havic in this valley.","1.5 miles from Springer Mountain
",Hawk Mountain Shelter,"Mar 25, Sun",9.60
Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584992,"Last night the wind really picked up and it got below freezing in our camping area.  I woke up shivering and had to put on all my layers.  The trees in the wind were making a squaking sound at the wind blew through them.  Patrick said it sounded like a giant goose!  
Today's weather was a lot better than the last few days.  It was cold, but clear.  We could actually see the other mountains instead of this wet dripping fog that had been plaguing us.  Plants were pushing through the fallen leaves showing us signs of spring.  There was a lot more hills today than yesterday.  We started earlier and covered less miles.  We've been making sure to stretch to ease all the hard work our legs have been doing.  We ran into a little more trail magic as well, someone was giving out water bottles in an area that didn't have much water.  
We got to camp around 4:30 earlier than before.  Sounds of laughter were coming from the shelter.  It had a great communal area for hanging out.  We've met people from all over that are planning on hiking the whole trail or just a section.  Everyone was taking about the guy Overkill and his 100 pound cart.  At least that's one way to get a trail name.  
It's a bit cold tonight but not too windy.  Hopefully I'll get better sleep than the last few days. It just takes time for your body to adjust.","Hawk Mountain Shelter
",Gooch Mountain Shelter,"Mar 26, Mon",7.60
Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585110,"Last night's rest was way better than the few previous nights.  Patrick woke up to find acorns in his shoes.  Some woodland creature found a premade hole to store their food.  Unfortunately, that store wasn't permanent.  
Today's weather cold but good hiking weather.  It was one of the clearer days with visibility at least ten miles from tops of mountains.  At one point we walked into the clouds, the environment instantly changed with a super dense fog.  There were large rain drops falling every 30 seconds.  With only a few actually hitting me.  During lunch time I found out that my plastic spoon couldn't handle cold peanut butter and it snapped in half.  I ended up fixing it with duct tape and sticks.
We met many more through hikers today.  Even a person from Austin!  Her name was Mudfoot and she was traveling with her friend Cricket. They told us their real names but trail names seem to stick better.   We started talking about the guy Overkill. He's made a name for himself on the trail.  We haven't seen him wheel through yet.  He might still be camping out at Springer mountain shelter.
When we got to our destination at Lance creek the camping spots were entirely full.   It was bound to happen since that area only had 6 spots.  We decided to fill our water there and push on to camp somewhere down the trail. Lance creek was also a place were there was an outbreak of noravirous the previous year.  We made sure to filter and use chemical treatment on that water.
About a mile from Lance creek we found an offshoot trail that lead to flat ground.  When camping off trail there are no luxuries like bear boxes or bear lines.  We had to set our own bear hang using the PCT method since bears have figured out how to snatch food using the traditional method.  You need a limb at least 15 feet high and 6 feet from the tree trunk.  It's really hard to search for a tree with that perfection in this forest.  We eventually found one.  On my first try using a rock bag, I threw the bag over the limb but didn't hold on to the other side of the cord.  The entire cord flew over the limb.  Patrick said you have to hold on to the other side!  The second time the rock bag got stuck between the fork in the tree branch.  No matter how much I pulled, it wasn't moving.  We ended up taking the loose end, trying it to a rock, and throwing it over the branch.  With Patrick and I hiding behind a tree, I pulled with all my weight. It finally broke loose and shot at us like a rocket.  Luckily we were not in its way!  My rock bag tore as well from all the pulling. 2 broken things in a day!   After about an hour and another 10 rock throws we got it on the branch!  Patrick said my trail name should be stuck bag.
During dinner, 3 hikers showed up wondering if there was space.  We gladly made room for them since they were also pushed out of Lance creek.  One was from New Hampshire and talked about hiking in the white mountains. He said the weather changes drastically since the peaks are in the jet stream.  We'll see in about 5 months what they are like!
We offered them to use our bear hang to hang their bags but when we tried, the rope wouldn't budge.  I feel that tree is cursed for bear hanging.  
We're camping up high in elevation tonight, so it's a little colder that usual.  Tomorrow we conquer blood mountain and hit or first resupply at Neels gap. Apparently they heat up whole red baron pizzas for you.  Sounds amazing after hiking 40 miles!","Gooch Mountain Shelter
",Lance Creek,"Mar 27, Tue",9.60
Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585180,"We woke up in a haze as the fog rolled into our camping area.  The people who joined us to camp left about 5:30 in the morning to make a reservation at hawk cabins in Neels gap.  The things you do for some home comforts.  Patrick and I slept in until 7:30.  Patrick tried to get the bear bag out of the tree and the cord got stuck on his stuff sack. I thought our food was going to be stuck in that cursed tree.  After 10 minutes of swinging the bags around the tree, we were able to get our food down.
We made our way to blood mountain, the highest peak in Georgia.  On the way there we met up with Cricket and Mudfoot.  I learned that Cricket had traveled to Chile to teach gardening to children.  I taught English in Chile back in 2011.  We talked about all the different regions in Chile and how they are very different.  Especially Chiloe island with all its lore about monsters living on the island.  It made me miss Chile and all the great people there.  
We followed Cricket and Mudfoot all the way up blood mountain.  The wind was really picking up as we walked through fast moving clouds.  The trail was littered with  wet rocks and mud that made the ascent slippery.  Laural trees were covering the mountain side with lica covering their branches.  The climb only took about 30 minutes but that was the steepest climb yet on the AT.  When we got to the top the view was blinded by thick clouds.  Trees eerily appeared in the distance as if they were floating.  At the top was the blood mountain shelter, it was sturdy shelter made of brick.  About 15 thru hikers were eating their lunch in it.  At this point Cricket had been referring to Patrick as Chops and me as Chile.  We had been given trail names!  Patrick wasn't overly excited about his name.  You always have a choice to keep a trail name.  
The descent off of blood mountain was just as tricky.  There were steep we rock slopes and large bolders we have to scamble over.  The mud was liquid and made the descent more difficult.   Eventually the clouds cleared from the forest, the air got warmer, and we were closing in on Neels Gap.  
When we arrived at Neels Gap, we were greeted with a large tree with boots hanging from the branches at an outfitter store.   20 percent of thru hikers quit at Neels Gap.  They will throw their boots in the tree as a symbolic way of quitting.  The outfitters had some good resupply options.   They also had whole red baron pizzas for sale.  Patrick and I both bought one and finished the whole thing.  It was soo good.  
At the picnic tables outside we met Napoleon.  We had heard about him from other hikers.  He had thru hiked the AT, PCT, and CDT before. Now he was attempting to yoyo the AT.  Which is 4,400 miles of hiking.  He was spewing knowledge about ultralight hiking techniques, philosophy on life, and cracking jokes non stop.  He was from Baton Rouge and was in the Superdome in New Orleans when Katrina hit.  He said during that time he lost faith in humanity because of all the awful things that happened there.  Hiking the trail and meeting generous people along the way restored his faith.  
We ended up staying at the hostel at the outfitters.  They had a shower and bunk beds, that's all I needed.  It felt amazing to get 5 days of grime and dirt off.  The hostel had a pretty good common area.  Everyone was cracking more jokes about Overkill and his 100 pound cart.  At 7 pm some employees fired up the grill and made hot dogs for all of us!  I ended up eating 4 of them.  The hiker hunger is kicking in!
Towards hiker midnight (9 pm) I remet Helen.  I originally saw her with her partner on the approach trail at black gap shelter.  The day after it downpoured.  She had  mentioned that she had not been getting much sleep on the trail over the last 5 days since she had been freezing in her sleeping bag.  I mentioned that she could do crunches before going to bed to warm herself up.  She really wanted wine to help her fall asleep and was thinking about hitching a ride into town in the morning to grab some.  Another hiker heard her story, went into his pack, and pulled out a box a wine for her.  He had been carrying it for the last 4 days but wasn't going to drink it.  This is just some of the magic that happens on the trail!
Tonight I have a cozy warm bunk bed to sleep on.  The hostel didn't provide any sheets or pillows, but I don't need them since I'm living out of a backpack.","Lance Creek
",Neels Gap,"Mar 28, Wed",8.50
Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585256,"Today was the longest hike yet.  Patrick and I hiked 11 miles over moderate terrain.  At one point, I got into a groove. My feet and hiking poles were in sync.  I was making a good pace and passing up hikers.  However, after mile 10 the ball of my left foot started hurting. It was from the constant pounding my feet have been doing over the last 6 days.  We took a break and I massaged my foot back to recovery.  
We arrived at the shelter around 5 pm and the area was already packed with tents. There were slim pickings for camping spots.  When I set my ground cloth next to Patrick's I noticed there was broken glass on the ground.  After picking up 4 pieces, I gave up on the spot. I have an air mattress and didn't want to pop it during the night.  
It started raining right after I setup my tent in a new spot.  I cooked pasta with tomato sauce leather then added in cheese and milk powder.  It was really tasty after a long day of hiking. The rain finally stopped and a boy named mountain goat got a fire started.  A good fire on rainy day brings people together.  We met a woman who's job was to fly probes around Mars and collect information.  Our group couldn't think of a trail name worthy enough for her.  A guy from Wisconsin showed us how to use birch bark to start fires.  Birch bark has a lot of natural oil which can be burned even when wet.  Patrick and I discussed trekking to Unicoi gap tomorrow and then hitching a ride to Helen, GA.  Helen is a touristy German town and probably has great beer.  We'll see how the hitching goes since we're two dudes.  It's easier for females to hitch rides.  
It started raining again and everyone called it a night.  Right now a puddle is forming under my tent.  I'm glad the tent ground material is waterproof!","Neels Gap
",Low gap shelter,"Mar 29, Thu",11.50
Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585435,"I woke up today with mud totally covering my tent.  It was on the fly, the body, and the under cloth.  A puddle of mud water formed under my tent.  I took my time cleaning it so mud wasn't packed away.  
We had a late start but it was worth it!  A couple of hikers gave us most of their snacks since it was their last day.  We gladly expected all of them.  I was excited to receive extra calories.  I'v been eating more and more calories eat day to counterbalance the amount I burn.
Patrick and I hiked 10 miles today.  We hiked over old avalanche rock beds and up a 1000 foot climb.  My calves were feeling sore today.  Everyday a new body part is sore.  Eventually I'll have my trail legs and will be used to the up and down hikes.  
At Unicoi valley we tried our hitchhiking skills.  We fashioned a sign for Helen GA specifically for beer.  Within 10 min we had a ride from Jake.  He was a land manager who worked for the national forest service.  He explained the importance of minimal impact on the forest and gave us a good tips on the best bars in Helen.  Helen was rebuilt to resemble a small German town even though it didn't have any German heritage.  The boulevards were filled with souvenir shops and kitchy restaurants.  We took the advice of Jake and went to Catch 22 for craft beers and gastropub food.  We gorged on salad and had a pint.  After dinner we stopped at the local liquor store and picked up beer.  We stuck out or thumbs and was picked up in 5 minutes heading back to Unicoi Gap.  The gentleman who picked us up worked for the dental industry.  He showed us all the damage a tornado did to the trees on the hillside from a few years ago to just 10 days ago.  Trees were splintered like tooth picks along the windy road back to Unicoi Gap.  Luckily the damage only occurred on the south side of the mountain.  We were camping on the other side.
In Unicoi Patrick and I setup our tents and drank the rest of the beer.  We stumbly hung our bear bags and tucked in for the night.  The wind rolled in and the weather dropped.  It's about 32 degrees right now and the wind is howling!","Low gap shelter
",Unicoi Gap,"Mar 30, Fri",9.70
Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585436,"Last night we camped near the Unicoi gap parking lot.  We were visited by many cars blaring music all through the night.  I was able to sleep through some of it.  We packed up around 7:30 and ate a cold breakfast.  I had cherry poptarts which I haven't had since college.  
The trek today had a greater climbs then the other treks we've had.  It was a 1000 foot climb, then 1000 foot descent, then a 1500 foot climb.  We were greeted with spectacular views of the Georgia landscape with clear skies.  During the trek my right knee started hurting.  It seems everyday a new body part hurts.  
On our way to Tray gap a hiker told us there was a trail angel giving out food and drinks.  I was excited about having a second lunch.  A man named Cookie Monster was giving out free drinks, chips, candy, fruit, and soup.  I had it all.  A hot cup of soup made my day after doing all those climbs.  Cookie Monster supports thru hikers because it inspires him to hike.  He's gained a lot of weight over the years and was looking for a way to lose it.  While devouring all of Cookie Monster's food we met a boy scout troop leader named Crabby from Akron, Ohio!  I mentioned I went to Highland High School and he tried giving me the trail name Highland.  It didn't really resonate with me.  After snacking, Patrick and I headed off on full stomachs and lifted spirits.  
We made it to Tray mountain shelter around 2 pm.  We decided to call it a day there. The sun was shining and there was a light breeze in the air.  We hung up our tents to let them dry out from the rain storm two days prior.  I took care of my feet by popping a few blisters that have been forming and covered them with leuko tape.  Hopefully, no other ones form.
Tomorrow we're staying at the budget inn in Hiawasee, GA.  It's supposed to be really run down, but it will be nice to sleep in a real bed and have a hot shower.  We'll be resuppling there, eating our fruits and vegetables, and doing laundry.  It's the little things that lift our spirits to get us back in the woods.","Unicoi Gap
",Tray Mountain Shelter,"Mar 31, Sat",5.70
Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585482,"Last night was one of the best rests in awhile.  The night was a bit cool but I didn't need all my layers.  Patrick and I got moving around 9:30.  We had a reservation at the budget inn in Hiawasee today.  We were looking forward to showers and washing clothes.  We needed to make it to dick's creek about 11 miles away to make it into town.
The trail was pretty moderate today.  There were a few heavy climbs, but the descent was gradual.  My right knee started hurting on the descents and I started using my left foot to take the pounding down the steps.  However, the ball of my foot started hurting on that foot.  I'll just need to keep walking, soreness is going to be part of the trail.  
We met up with Crabby and Cuz. They started calling me ""no name"" since I didn't have a trail name yet.  I didn't know I would need a trail name so soon.  We also met up with another group that gave me the trail name heartland since I was from Ohio.  I'm still waiting on an event that gives me a trail name.  Patrick has the trail name Booger Bear.  He got it when he was snoring because of a cold and people thought he was a bear.  We'll see when my name comes.
We eventually arrived in dick's creek.  An old Ford van from the 80s rolled up.  It was our ride to Budget inn.  The van was falling apart from the inside.  Duct tape held together the door handles and the floor was peppered with mud from other thru hikers.  When we checked into the budget inn, it was exactly as you would expect.  Old carpet, old beds, bathroom from the 70s, and an early tube tv.  It was paradise.
Patrick and I stopped at Subway and got a sandwich with all the veggies.  That really hit the spot.  At the motel we started so shaking down our stuff. We have a better idea of what we needed and what we don't.  I shook down my bladder, my stuff sacks, part of my first aid kit, my toilettre bag.  I probably shedded at least 1 1/2 pounds.  When summer hits in Virginia, I'll be shedding my cold weather clothes.
Right now I'm laying in a squeaky bed watching cable access television.  They have a channel totally dedicated to the town Helen.  One man is narrating how he came up with the fake German town.  It's riveting.","Tray Mountain Shelter
",Dick's Creek,"Apr 01, Sun",11
Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585594,"Last night's stay at the budget inn was not too bad.  I didn't get any bed bug bites nor was it too loud. We stayed up until 1 am which is way past hiker midnight.  We headed out around 8:30 am to finish a few errands.  The budget inn van took hikers back to the trail at 9 and 11 am.  At the post office one of the clerks said you must be hikers in those puffy jackets. Puffy jackets are light weight and versatile.  At the grocery store we were stopped in the dairy asile by a trail angel buying grub to feed hikers.  His cart was filled with hot dogs, chips, cookies, and other junk food.  He asked is this food good for hikers?  It was definitely good with all those calories.  We headed back to the motel just in time to catch the van back to dick's creek.
The trail today was not too strenuous, but day after day my feet and legs are taking a pounding.  I started wrapping my right knee to take the pressure off it when going down hills.  The ball of my left foot was also hurting on most descents.  We originally planned to do 6 to 8 miles, but ended up doing 10.  It's weird that my ankle is not hurting but these other body parts are.  Hopefully I'll have my trail legs soon to overcome this pain.
All along the trail was signs of spring.  Flowers and small plants were pushing up through dead leaves.  Bugs were coming out in numbers as the temperature rose.  The sky was clear and it was a Sunny 70 degrees.  I ended up zipping off my nerdy convertible pants into shorts.  
We crossed the Georgia / North Carolina border around 5:30 pm.  Patrick and I cheered and drank our beers that we packed out.  Nothing tastes better than a beer after a 10 mile hike over mountains. Very soon afterwards we made it to camp.
The sky is clear tonight and I see twinkling lights in the distance from people's homes.","Dick's Creek
",Bly Gap,"Apr 02, Mon",9
Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585807,"Last night was one of the quieter nights on the trail.  The wind wasn't howling, the trees weren't cracking, the critters were not making a sound. I still woke up a few times during the night because of leg and hip pain.  Shifting yourself in a sleeping bag is a challenge.  Sometimes I've had the zipper move to underneath me.  Then I'll need to do a few log rolls place the zipper on the right place.  This morning I packed up a little faster since I have less stuff to pack after the shakedown.  I cooked oatmeal with strawberries and cream.  Then made it a ""one stop shop"" with added instant coffee.
We got trekking around 9:30. The start was an uphill battle.  The trail seemed to go straight up the mountain.  It was slow going until we reached the top.  We did a celebratory leg stretch.  I made sure to stretch my it band and took some vitamin I.  That greatly helped my knee from the downhill pounding.  It was slow going over the next 8 miles.  We were leap frogging the same group of hikers all day.  For lunch, I ate tortillas with peanut butter and pepperoni.  It wasn't that bad!  The last stretch was all uphill to the shelter.  My walk became almost a crawl but we made it.
We decided to sleep in the shelter because it was supposed to rain.  I was tired of cleaning mud off my tent and having a damp tent to pack up.  With our sleeping bags added, the shelter was almost full.  One more person showed up and asked if there was space.  He said his name was Santiago.  My cousin Kate told me about him before I started hiking.  He was her sister in law's dad!  He was surprised to meet me on the trail.  I'll be sleeping next to him in the shelter tonight. 
A group of hikers started a fire and we joined them.  One hiker's name was Lieutenant Dan but everyone wanted to call him Baywatch because he was half naked all the time.  He wasn't wearing a shirt had short shorts and his legs and feet were covered in mud.  Eve was from Vermont.  She was vegan and had a hard time finding vegan resupply options.  She had to lax some of her restrictions when food contained milk and eggs.  The woman from bolder showed up with her dog Theodore.  That pooch was super cuddly with everyone.  A dog on the trail seems to brighten everyone's day.  She was trying to eat mashed potatoes from a bag with the same collapsible spork that Patrick had.  This spork always fell apart and into your food bag.   She was having the same issue.   Her hands were covered with mashed potatoes as she was trying to eat the last morsale of food. 
We called it a night around hiker midnight.  I tried putting my sleeping clothes in the dark since I forgot my headlamp.  That prooved to be a challenge.  I snuggled in with 5 other hikers in the shelter.  Some started snoring loudly and a rain storm is one the way.  It's going to be a long night.","Bly Gap
",Standing Indian Shelter,"Apr 03, Tue",7.70
Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585808,"Last night was a loud one.  Patrick and I were kept awake by Eve snoring like a wet sloppy balloon.  The downpour started at 3 am, the metal roof echoed the noise inside the shelter.  I hardly got sleep.  When we awoke, the area was misty and rainy.  Almost everyone left early in the rain except us. Patrick and I left a little later but the rain stopped and the sun was coming out.  It pays to start late.
Our initial climb was up to standing Indian mountain.  It was the tallest mountain we've climbed so far.  There wasn't much to see with all the fog at the summit.  We met up with Fuiji Pump who we didn't see since Bly gap.  He was named fuiji pump because he was expecting water facets every 10 miles.  Most of the trail was pretty gradual.  Hiking seemed easier today than the last few days.  I met Anne and Wizard on the trail.  We joked around about getting tons of pancakes in Franklin NC.  The first Baptist Church gives away all you can eat pancakes and bacon.  We were thinking about packing out a gallon bag filled to the brim of pancakes, bacon, and sryup.  Mmmmhmmm  After 11 miles, we arrived at Betty Creek.  We decide to push further to the next shelter 5 miles away.  The only problem was that Albert mountain was in the way.  The initial climb was gradual until we saw the fire tower at the peak.  Then it was a straight shot up over bolders and steep stairs.  At the top you could walk up the stairs of the fire tower.  It was a breathtaking view.  The wind was fierce and it felt like it would blow me off the mountain.  Leaving the peak, it was another gradual 3 miles info l until the shelter.
The tenting area was packed at the shelter.  There was two horizontal areas in the shelter were Patrick and I had space. We set out our sleeping bags making sure that we were not going to be kicked in the night.  We made dinner and joked about Overkill.  Apparently he got off the trail and couldn't finish it with his cart.  Patrick almost caught his leg on fire when he didn't realize that his alcohol stove was still lit.  I yelled Hey hey hey!  Everyone thought it was so funny that maybe that should be my trail name.  I'll see if I can shorten it.
It's cold tonight in the shelter.  It's supposed to be below freezing.  Eve is also in the shelter with us.  It may be another long night....","Standing Indian Shelter
",Long Branch Shelter,"Apr 04, Wed",16.30
Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585866,"Patrick and I woke up with the crowd in the shelter.  Everyone was joking around while we were in our sleeping bags.  No one wanted to get out because it was so cold.  People were talking about getting up early to use the privy even though it was so cold.  We got up, put our packs together, and ate breakfast.  We headed out around 8:30, our earlier start yet!
We had a shorter hike today to winding staircase.  It was a pretty easy hike until it was uphill for about 2 miles.  It seemed to go on for awhile, but we finally submitted the peak. We met purple streak an older woman who was giving out trail magic.  She was hiking a few days earlier but slipped and broke her wrist.  She was using the straps on her trekking poles, but that caused her to break her wrist as she fell. Patrick and I haven't been using our straps since Napoleon told us about breaking your wrist.  She had oranges, almonds, chocolate, and candy.  I hope she comes back to the trail to try again.  I've heard of many people breaking something only to return later to the trail.
Afterwards it was gradual again until we finally got to winding staircase.  At the intersection we saw Walkman giving out trail magic food.  We met him earlier on a hike were he gave us Miller Light on the mountain.  He wants to live on the trail and get away from a 9 to 5 job.  Ron Haven gave us a ride into Franklin.  He was a business man who owned the budget inn as well as The Baltimore Jack's hostel.  He knew multiple languages as well as Cherokee.  He was an encyclopedia of information and even named all 8 presidents from Ohio which I didn't know. 
We got to the Sapphire Inn and were greeted by our hiker friends.  Anne, Wizard, Baywatch, and Aladdin were in the parking lot hanging out.   We grabbed some grub at Mi Casa across the street.  Their fajitas were really good.  Afterwards we did laundry in our rain gear.  I was really sweaty for an hour while we waited for our clothes to be clean.
We both had showers and felt much better.  Up the hill near the motel, more hikers were hanging out and drinking bud light.  That beer was basically water beer to Patrick and I.  We gladly accepted free beer though.  The hikers were taking about what it takes to get to Maine.  It seemed pretty challenging but doable.  Another hiker showed up with a bag cheeseburgers from McDonald's.  Everyone went to town on those free burgers. Middle brother a hiker who did a thru the previous year said he packed out 5 days worth of McDonald's.  Yes, McDonald's will last that long with all those peservatives. Tripp and Elbow showed up, they were a daughter father combo.  Tripp was a 53 year old retired Marine.  Elbow was a 29 year old cytotechnologist.  Tripp said his body was in pain.  Since he was a Marine, the doctors just gave him prescriptions.  He left and came back with a bottle of Valium and was handing it out like it was candy to all the mid 20 year olds.    He said taking 2 would have you flying in the night.  
After hanging out on the hill we headed to the Lazy Hiker Brewery.  Middle brother tried to get all 10 of us to hitch a ride to the brewery.  It was only a 10 minute walk but he said you shouldn't have to walk more miles than you have to.  It was close to dusk and most drivers won't pick up hitchers at night.  He was adamant about hitching.  After about 5 minutes, Gumby a section hiker, drove to the brewery.  That car was packed like a clown car.  Middle brother jumped in the trunk, but there wasn't any room for Patrick and I.  We ended up walking there anyways.  On the way we met up with Wizard and Anne who were just coming from the brewery.  We conviced them to go back.  
When we arrived at the brewery, Rocking Ronnie was headlining the stage and singing covers.  We had heard about him days earlier and all the partying he had been doing in the shelters.  They called him Rocking Ronnie because he carried a guitar on the trail which was an extra 20 pounds of weight.  Outside people were discussing the new kicks they bought at Outdoor 76.  It's a shoe shop with foot expert.  It seems that he sold everyone the same type of shoe.  I was wondering if he was the music man getting everyone to buy his wares.  I might go see him tomorrow to see if he's legit or not.  
After the brewery, we followed a group of hikers to the Budget Inn.  They had pizza, beer, and two large trays of chilimac from a church event.  It seemed that people staying in the room didn't want a party to start.  We ate a good amount of pizza though.  There were no utensils for the chilimac though.  Walkman tore off the side of a pizza box and made a makeshift spoon.  He funneled copious amounts of chilimac into his mouth getting little pieces stuck in his beard and on the floor.  After we had our fill of food we headed back to the Sapphire Inn.  
Everyone was still partying outside when we arrived.  It was way past hiker midnight.  Walkman appeared with chilimac and salad.  We all made makeshift spoons from Pringles can lids, cups, and pieces of lettuce.  I believe there's still chilimac somewhere in someone's room at the Sapphire.  I won't be surprised if it gets packed out.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585928,"We had a zero day in Franklin today.  A zero is no trail miles, it doesn't count all the miles you walk while you're in town.  We set our alarms for 6:45 am to wake up in time for free pancakes and bacon.  It was rough waking up after partying until 1 am.  However the free food was worth it.   The First Baptist Church gave us all the free food we could eat.  They even gave us letters that we could send home to our families.   I had two plates of food but couldn't eat anymore since I ate so much the night before.  
We got back to our motel around 8:20 and chilled until 10 am.  We headed to dollar general for a resupply.  The prices there were far cheaper than the grocery store.  We filled up on all the hiker necessities.  Tuna, instant mashed potatoes, pasta sides, pop tarts, granola bars, summer sausage, and Snickers. Basically all the stuff you shouldn't eat on a normal diet.  We needed high caloric food to sustain ourselves for 10 to 15 mile hike days.  Patrick bought extra to ship to Fontana Lodge which is the southern boundary of the smokies.  We're planning on not resupplying in Gatlinburg since it's so expensive.  
Patrick broke down the food he bought while listening to his pasta and sunglasses playlist.  We walked to the post office about 15 min away.  He picked up his package drop that his parents sent.  It was filled with homemade cookies, towels that expanded when water was added, journals,  a miniature kite, and plastic bags.  As I waited for Patrick, a woman asked if I needed a ride in town. I told her I was still waiting on my friend.  When we were finished we tried hitching back into town but with no luck.  
We stopped at Outdoor 76 who had a local shoe guru.  We haf heard from many people about his expertise in shoe fitting.  I told him that I had been having knee pain, but other than that I was fine.  I told him the weight of my pack and the number of miles we've been doing.  He said to cut back on the number of miles we're doing to 6 - 8 miles a day.  Katahdin isn't moving and were not in a race.  Patrick ended up buying new shoes since he discovered his soles were falling off the old ones.  He buried the old shoes in a planter in front of Outdoor 76.  They'll grow some beautiful flowers someday.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586124,"This morning we decided to sleep in and not get free pancakes and bacon.  It was a hard choice, but sleep overruled.  We got McDonald's breakfast instead.  It was Patrick's first time and said it was not bad.  We needed to get to Baltimore Jack's hostel before 11 am to take a shuttle back to Winding Stair Gap.  
We put our packs together and checked out of the Sapphire Inn.  We tried hitching to the hostel but with no takers.  It seemed harder to hitch in town then on the trail.  When we arrived, I bought 2 knee braces at the Three Eagles Outfitters.  The shoe guru said I had Jumper's knee and to look up treatment.  I was using the brace to help with the downhill descents
At winding stair gap we hiked up to the summit.  My legs  were feeling better with the new knee braces.  The mountains were covered in mist.  At some points we could see the mist reach out partially over the trail.  It felt like we were in a giant cold suana.  We stopped at the first shelter to figure the rest of hike and eat lunch.  It started drizzling.  As we hung out Aladdin, Scissors, Mr Clean, and Mateo showed up.  They were going to have a short day, then a long push tomorrow.  Mateo was trying to figure a trail name for me when I saved Patrick from setting himself on fire.  He was thinking aspestos.  Aladdin said he liked my trail name Ya-ah since I won't meet another person with that name.  He told story about two people named Seabiscuit on the PCT.  One would sign the trail logs as the real Seabiscuit.  Eventually the two caught up in the same town.  One was a beautiful woman from Europe the other was a guy from the states.  They decided to have a foosball tournament, the winner would get to rename the loser.  The guy was up by 5 points but then the woman crushed him.  She renamed him to Sea Cookie.  That story traveled all over the PCT that year.  
We headed out and the drizzling stopped.  We've been pretty lucky with the rain so far.  We went another 5 miles then found a campsite that was mostly filled.  It started sprinkling again we rushed to setup or tents.  We made dinner in the drizzle, I ate mashed potatoes with lemon pepper tuna.  It wasn't that bad.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586268,"When I awoke I found water inside my tent.  It was from my own breath.  The ground was frozen and my rain fly had ice all over it.  My gloves had been wet from the night before and they were useless in the cold.   I ate chocolate pop tarts and coffee for breakfast.  As I packed up, I would pack a few pieces away then blow warm air into my hands since they were so cold.  I would then put another few pieces away then blow into my hands.  As I was tightening my backpack, I heard a snap.  My internal carbon frame broke from the cold.  With it broken, it affected the load lifters on my pack were weight wasn't evenly distributed.  I would need to fix it somehow.
Patrick and I left the camping area.  It was a gradual climb up the mountains.  We made it to the fire tower which was supposed to have an amazing view.  There was too much fog cover to see anything.  I decided to fix the frame with super glue and duct tape.  As I was fixing it, Aladdin, Lt Dan, Mateo, and Mr Clean showed up.  We ate lunch at the fire tower.  The fog eventually lifted and we could see the entire valley below.  The super glue dried and I tried putting it in my pack. As I was trying to put it in, it snapped again.  I would need to fix it some other way.  I sent an email to Chris at ULA to see if he could send me a new one.  
We left the fire tower and headed to the shelter about 5 miles away.  As the sun warmed up the trees, pieces of ice started raining from the branches.  It felt like we were in a hail storm.  You could hear thoughout the woods ice sprinkling down on the leaves below. 
We made it to the shelter around 3.  Lt Dan already had a fire going.  He's pretty good about getting wet wood to burn.  The fire was warm and it kept everyone there. Strider, a man in his 50s was staying the the shelter.  He was super fast. Sometimes he could hike 10 to 12 hours to cover 30 miles in a single day.  Patrick prepared his dinner by momma birding sausage into his dinner.  Some of the people noticed him spitting meat into his soup.  I met another woman who had a dog with her.  The dog was super cozy with his own sleeping bag and pad!  That was one spoiled pup.  She said she couldn't wait until it was warmer so she could shed the warmer winter gear. I met another guy from Ohio.  He started talking about cedar point, an amusement park in Sandusky Ohio.  It's one of the greatest ones with many rollar coasters.  I haven't been there in years.  I was eventually able to be fix my frame by using my tent emergency field repair time.  People hung around the fire until 8:30.  Hiker midnight was setting in early.

We headed out around 8:30.  The area was covered in a dense fog.  We had a 3000 foot descent into the NOC which was about a 12 mile hike.  The trail was slick mud all the way.  In the fog, the moss was shooting up sprouts that looked neon green.   It looked like an alien planet.  Part of the descent was over steep rocks that had a cliff with trees on the other side.  
After slipping down the trail we finally made it to the NOC.  Aladdin, Lt Dan, Zero, and Mr Clean were already there.  I picked up my package drop from the supply store. It was filled with goodies from back home.  There were dinners, protein bars, cookies, summer sausage, cheese.  There was so much that I shared it with Patrick.  We ate at the restaurant on the river.   From the restaurant you can watch canoers paddled up stream. I ordered a salad because my body was craving greens.  People found out was my birthday and they sung using Ya-ah instead of my real name.  Patrick bought me dinner for my birthday! Yay! 
We ended up getting a bunk at the NOC with Wizard, Anne, and Two Crows.  Aladdin said he completed the 12 mile trek today in 3 1/2 hours.  He was skipping down those steep steps.  Strider told us that we should almost be out of food before we get into town.  You will know that you brought just enough then.  He told us a story about him hardly having enough food on one of his treks.  He was so hungry on the last day that he slurped his entire bottle of mayonnaise.  He said it tasted amazing.  I tried eating more of my food in preparation for the 3000 climb tomorrow.  We drank beer and played drawing telephone and heads up.

Today's climb was one of the tougher ones.  It was 7 miles up hill with a 3000 foot elevation difference.  The trail was pretty steep in some areas.  It felt like I was walking straight up the mountain.  We had a few stretch breaks on the way up.  My knee started acting up, but it was more sore than painful.  About 5 miles up we came to a spectacular view.  It was clear compared to yesterday.  We ate lunch there.  I wish we didn't because after that spot was the steepest climb of the day.  My body was using energy to digest food and trying to climb.  It was tough.  
We arrived at the shelter around 3 pm and called it a day.  It's great to roll into camp early and just chill.  A few other people showed up later including Two Crows, Mountain Goat, and his mom.  We hadn't seen them since Hiawasee.  We started a fire as the air was cooling down.  I made one of my dehydrated meals, Taco Mac n Cheese.  Two Crows gave me a slice off a stick of butter he brought.  It added a ton of flavor.

We headed out around 9:30.  About 30 minutes later we were at the top of Cheoah mountain.  Patrick and I busted out our beers that we had been packing since the NOC.  We cheered at the top and did a shot of Jack Daniel's honey whisky.  We hung out at the top for an hour ehjoying the sun and the view.  A few other hikers did as well. After about 5 miles we arrived at Stacoah gap.  There was trail magic of bananas and apples just sitting in the picnic table.  I ate 3 bananas.  I need that potassium!   Out of Stacoah gap was Jacob's ladder.  I thought it was easy at the beginning but then the trail went straight up the mountain and was covered with stairs.  A few times I had to stop to catch my breath.  I could hear my heart pumping in my ears.  It was tougher than the climb yesterday.
Shortly after the ladder we arrived at the shelter.  There was only one tent behind the shelter.  We were surprised there wasn't more people.  Mountain Goat and his mom showed up shortly later.  I made pasta meat sauce for dinner and shared some spices, parmesan cheese, and summer sausage with Patrick.

The beginning of the hike was pretty gradual today.  There was some decent ups and downs but nothing like Jacob's ladder.  My right knee started bothering me today.  Stairs are not the best friends to my knees.   We had lunch around 1 pm.  That break was what my knees needed.  From our lunching spot we could see Fontana Dam.   It was massive since we were looking at it from 4 miles away.  It was about another 3 miles until we arrived at the Marina.
There was epic trail magic at the end of our hike today!  Sally and Mr. Sally had a full spread of soda, candy, pasta sides, tuna, cheese crackers, band aides, soap, scarves, toothpaste, etc.  Basically anything you need to resupply.  Their son had hiked the trail in 2013 and they became trail angels after being inspired by their son's journey.  Mr. Sally gave us a ride into Fontana village to pick up our package drops.
When we got to the lodge I gave the clerk my ID to pickup the package. However, she couldn't find it.  Theresa sent me the tracking info.  It said it was waiting at the post office instead of the lodge.  The post office had closed though.  Patrick and I will make a trip back tomorrow to pick it up.  We'll also be splitting our food and sending the rest to Gatlinburg.  We don't want to carry 7 days of food over the smokies.

It felt nice to get the grime off me from the past few days.
We called the shuttle and headed back into Fontana village to pickup my resupply box.  When we arrived at the post office it said it didn't open until 11:45.  We did laundry while we waited.  They only had one working washer machine for the whole complex.  Santiago ended up doing his in the sink.  As we waited,  we listened to suped up Volkswagen hatchbacks zoom up and down the street.  The town hosts 500 drivers of Volkswagen golfs every year.  They speed all over the windy roads.  Our shuttle driver said they sounded like wookies in the forest.  I finally got my drop package.  The address was correct, but the mail clerk didn't deliver it to the lodge.  There was no reason for it to be held at the post office.  Patrick and I split our 7 days worth of food and shipped part of it to Gatlinburg. We didn't want to lug all that food up the mountain.  As we were waiting around, Mr. Sally showed up and gave us a ride back to the visitors center.  It was great timing!
From the visitors center we crossed the dam and entered Tennessee as well as the Smoky mountains.  The shelter was 10 miles away from the dam.  We left at 1 pm thinking we'd get there around 5:30.  We were wrong.  Most of the entire 10 miles was uphill.  Every mile today felt like 3 miles as we truged up the smokies.  My knees were doing ok, except the balls of my feet started hurting.  I had to make sure to walk heel to toe so they wouldn't hurt so bad.  Also, there wasn't much water on the trail.  We filled up once about 3 miles in and didn't have access to water for another 5 miles.  I ran out of water halfway up, but luckily I chugged a lot of water before the climb.  Not to mention we started midday and the temp at Fontana Dam was 80 degrees.  It was the hardest climb yet. It seemed to go on forever.  We started seeing different types of rocks, flowers, and wildlife.  I was looking down at the trail making sure I wasn't going up trip. I looked up and saw a deer staring back at me.  It was using the trail as an easy way to get around.  
We arrived at the shelter around 7:30.  I was starving since I only ate some gorp and protein bars.  I ate two dinners and the lunch I missed to make up the calories.  I still feel I could eat more.  The wind at the shelter is picking up and is whipping my tent.  It's a sign of colder weather to come.  Maybe I'll see snow on Sunday!","

We set out around 10 am.  As soon as you left the shelter you were greeted with fields of little white flowers.  There were miles and miles of them.  They would fallow the trail like the bluebonnets that bloom next to highways in Texas.  The wind kept howling all day.  It felt like the trees were going to topple over on top of the ridgeline.  I saw Patrick only twice today.  He was zooming down the trail.  It was a good hike until I got to Rocky mountain.  The descent was covered in flat loose rocks. It felt like I couldn't get my footing on them.  It was slow going for about an hour.  On the mountain balds, you could see for miles.   It was a pretty clear day too.  I also ran into another deer on top of a mountain.  At one point I was hiking on a flat trail, when my left ankle just gave out.  I threw my trekking poles aside and caught myself before I had a face full of dirt.  It's strange that a body part will give out.  Hopefully it doesn't do it when I'm really counting on it.
About 3 miles more, I stumpled apon the shelter.  Patrick had got in 30 minutes earlier.  Apparently 7 people had permits to sleep in the shelter.  If the shelter is full of thru hikers, a permit hiker can kick someone out.  At 8:30 pm those 7 didn't show up.  I doubt they will be hiking in tonight.  It's supposed to rain tonight and decided to tent it instead of in the shelter.  I hope that was a good choice.","Mollies Ridge Shelter

Patrick and I put on our rain suits then headed out.  It was our first real rain hike.  The wind started picking up more as we went along the ridgeline.  It felt like I was going to be blown over as wind and rain slapped my face.  The trail turned into tiny streams.  I felt my shoes let in a little more water with each step.  Eventually, my feet were swimming in my shoes.  The trail however was muddy and soft.  It felt really good on my feet.  The miles seemed to speed by even on slippery roots and mud.
I made it to the first shelter.  A few older gentleman were hanging out getting ready to hit the trail in the rain.  They mentioned they were trying to get to clingmans dome to catch a shuttle.  He also mentioned a Baptist Church group had a free shuttle at 9:30 and noon.  We figured we would go to the shelter right before clingmans dome then try the climb in the morning.  The weather is supposed to drop tonight as well.  We'll see if it snows.
When we showed up at the next shelter.  Sparrow was hanging out.  He had left our shelter earlier.  We decided to build a fire in there.  All the shelters in the smookies have fire places.  First we tried lighting some wet wood.  It went out.  Then we tried some of the denatured alcohol from our stoves.  I had found a whole roll of toilet paper in a field a day earlier and a tuna can.  We filled the can with alcohol then added half a roll of toilet paper into the can.  The thing lite like a torch.  It was enough to dry the wet wood.  We built a larger and larger fire.  A few hours later Reggie showed up then a couple from the UK named Jeans and Slayer.  Jeans had started the thru hike in jeans but quickly realized he would need a different pair of pants.  Another hour two engineers from Houston showed up.  We had a pretty full house.  Sparrow was telling everyone who entered to pay the fire tax by bringing in wood from the rain.  We ran drying lines and put our shoes by the fire to dry off.  It soon looked like a dry cleaning shop with all our gear hung up.   I made a tasty dinner of mashed meat.  It's potatoes with chicken.  
We all hung out until 7 am when everyone started going to sleep.  I eventually saw a message from Anne who sent it at 2 pm.  She mentioned that the access road to clingmans dome might be closed tomorrow due to weather.  We'll see if we'll need to make a trip to newfound gap instead!  It's supposed to be a low of 24 tonight.  Hopefully I'll stay warm.","Derrick Knob Shelter

We headed out around 9:40 to catch the noon Baptist shuttle at clingmans dome.  It was a 2.5 mile ascent up to the highest point on the AT.  Luckily the snow wasn't so much that we lost track of the trail.  The trail was easier on my feet as the snow provided a nice cush.  However, the climbs were harder since my feet kept slipping in the snow.  Snow was powdering us as well as everything in sight. It reminded me of snowboarding in Vermont during a snow shower.  It was silent outside except for the sound of snow hitting our rain jackets.  We didn't run into much ice either.  However, the trail was still pretty slushy from the rain yesterday.  
We made it clingmans dome around 11 am.  The access road to the top was closed due to weather.  We wouldn't be getting a shuttle into Gatlinburg from there.   We went up the observation deck to check the view from the top.  It was blowing snow and ice.  The tower looked like something out of a distopia.  The signs that labeled the views from the top were illegible.  We quickly got down from that tower.  We pressed onto Newfound gap to hopefully catch a shuttle from there.  The snow kept coming down all day.  We knew that Sparrow was in front of us.  We saw his name written in snow where he relieved himself.
When we arrived at newfound gap there were a few cars but no one else.  We heard that the restrooms were heated and headed over there.  That's when we found 8 other hikers huddled in the heated men's restroom.  We were all stuck there since the road into Gatlinburg was closed due to weather.  Jeans called the forest ranger.  They said they couldn't let anyone up the road unless it was an emergency.  Half the group was running out of food including Patrick.  Running out of food is not considered an emergency.  We were supposed to go into town today for our resupply.  Another woman and her son showed up.  She had extra food and was willing to share some with us.  The trail provides!  
We moved all our packs into the handicapped stall and laid out our sleeping bags.  We used copious amounts of toilet paper to clean up the floor from our shoe snow melt.  Hopefully tomorrow the road opens up.  Otherwise we're doing 13 sideway miles into town for a resupply.  Luckily, Gatlinburg has plenty of beer and moonshine!","Double Spring Gap Shelter

Only when the hikers found out she fainted they came to her rescue.  Sheriff Woody got his name because he SOBOed the AT with a short stocky friend and Woody was tall and lanky.  
Around 11 am the access road at newfound gap finally opened.  We rushed out of the men's bathroom to catch a ride.  The first Baptist Church shuttle was there dropping off hikers from Gatlinburg.  All 10 of us crammed into the van.  We were saved from the 18 hour ordeal in men's bathroom.  The weather was sunny and clear.  You could see the mountain ranges as we drove down the mountain. 
The first thing we did in Gatlinburg is drink at the Rocky mountain brewery.  They had 10 5 oz pours for 11 bucks.  Not a bad deal for all that beer.  We hung out with Peabody and Flagstaff, two hikers that we met in the men's bathroom.  We chowed down on hamburgers, quesadillas, salads, and french fries.  Between the 4 of us we had 40 5 oz beers and no other room on the table.  Anne and Wizard showed up a little later.  We made reservations at the Quality Inn. It was definitely better than the budget inn in Hiawasee.  Fainting Goat and Sheriff Woody had shown us a video of termites hatching in their room at the budget inn.  The owner offered them a free night stay in their jacuzzi suite.  However, during the night bed bugs bit them all over.  Patrick and I didn't have that problem though.  We we're lucky.
We hung out at the Quality Inn doing luandry and picking up our resupply box.  We headed back to the Rocky mountain brewery for trivia.  Ann and Wizard killed it at trivia.  We won second place and got $25 bucks off our tab!  Our total bill came to 6 bucks.  We then headed to Shamrocks a local dive bar that had karaoke.  On they way we did a moonshine tasting.  We had 13 small shots of moonshine for 5 bucks.  At  shamrocks, there only hikers and a few karaoke regulars.  We shared a few pitchers. I got up and sung Tribute by Tenacious D.  It's my default song.  Booga bear sung a more obscure David Bowie song.  Wizard and Anne headed out earlier since they were going to catch the 8:30 shuttle in the morning to clingmans dome.  Booga bear and I went on the hunt for late night food.  There wasn't anything open past midnight except one pizza place. We placed a delivery order for our motel.
When the pizza arrived we saw that the delivery person was having an issue finding our apartment.  We went down to meet her at the office.  That's when the night clerk told us that a 900 lb bear that eats out of the garage at the Quality Inn.  She said he also liked to hang out at the pool.  She was irritated that the other clerks don't let the guests know about the bear.  I'm sure that wouldn't be a selling point for the motel.  Booga and I ate our pizza from the balcony waiting for the bear.     Unfortunately, he didn't show up.  It would have been ridiculous to have our first bear sighting at the Quality Inn!  Tonight we have a cozy bed.  A lot better than the men's restroom.","Newfound Gap

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587248,"I woke up and rushed down to the Quality Inn's office for free breakfast.  It was a full spread!  They had biscuits and gravy, eggs, sausage, a pancake machine, a waffle maker, yogurt, dessert, and cereal.  I made sure to have extra helping of breakfast for today's hike.  
We headed over to the NOC to wait for the church shuttle.  While we were waiting Miss Janet showed up. I have been hearing about her for weeks.  She helps a lot of thru hikers with rides and supplies.  We all crammed into her massive van and took off for newfound gap.  She told us stories about taking hikers to the hospital for spilling their boiling food on their groins.  She warned us about cooking food on the table and we should cook it on the ground. She reached for her front dash and grabbed a ninja sword that hiker was carrying on their pack.  The hiker expected to bush wack on the AT except the trail is well maintained.  Miss Janet ripped on all the YouTube hiker experts who sometimes gave bad advice.  Especially about the ones where they told you that you only need your puffy jacket as an insulating layer.  Expect when a puffy gets wet it doesn't keep you warm.  She mentioned that wool, fleece, and silk keep you warm even when it's wet.  She ripped on Darwin a YouTube hiker who had quality hiking videos.  Someone in the van asked her about what tape she had in the tapedeck.  She mentioned it was with the van when she bought it.  She pushed it in and it was a Phish tape.  Of course, that tape would have came from that van.  
We arrived at newfound gap around noon and paid one last respect to our bathroom shelter.  We headed out for a shelter about 10 miles out.  The weather was warm and we had clear skies.  There was still patches of snow from the day before.  About 4 miles in we arrived at Charlie's bunion.  It was an overlook where you could see for several miles.  Most of the trail was covered in flat rocks that really hurt my feet.  I was always excited when a dirt patch was coming up in the trail to relieve my feet.   
We eventually got to the shelter around 5:30.  It was a packed house!  There were a lot of people stuck in Gatlinburg from the weather who had restarted their hike.  Booga and I were in an artificial bubble from the weather.  We met Blood Root at the shelter.  She had just gotten her degree in horticulture.  We were picking her brain about all the plants in the area.  She was called Blood Root because sometimes she has a temper.  Booga and I made dinner.  I had rice, chicken, broccoli, and powdered cheese.  It came out pretty good!  
Tonight I'm listening to the wind on the other side of the ridge.  It's pretty nice being in the tent since I don't have to listen to people snore.  Unless someone is so loud that I'll hear them in my tent...","Newfound Gap

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587733,"Last night was pretty warm.  The wind was howling through the trees but the tenting area was down the ridge.  I got up around 7:30, made oatmeal for breakfast, then we headed out.  It was going to be a 12 mile day.  The air was freezing though.  Yesterday it was 65 today it was around 30.  
The trek was pretty gradual.  We rushed at the beginning to warm up our bodies.  My hands were freezing.  I blew breath into them to warm them up.  As we climbed in elevation it got colder and colder.  The clouds were blowing through the trees.  With them brought cold moisture that froze to the trees.  They became white as the water froze to their leaves and needles.  It seemed that the smokies couldn't make a choice whether it was spring or winter.  Most of the 12 miles were flat stones too.  They really killed my feet.  I hope when were out of the park that the trail becomes soft mud again.  
We arrived at the first shelter for lunch.  I ate a tortilla with herb and garlic tuna, cheez its, and mustard.  When you're hungry it's not that bad, ever.  In the shelter there were still hikers lounging in their sleeping bags.  They were watching a movie too.  That's one way to start the day.  We headed back out.  Our shelter was another 7 miles.  The temperature dropped to 20 degrees with the wind blowing.  It was another mad rush to warm ourselves up. 
We made it to the cosby shelter around 3 pm. It was almost empty.  We quickly grabbed a spot before it filled up. It was supposed to fall to 28 tonight and it's always warmer in the shelter.  I met Splash, Burger King, FiveO, and a few other hikers.  Splash got a roaring fire going in the shelter.  We talked about the last few crazy days of weather.  Most of the hikers in the shelter were stuck in Gatlinburg because of the snow.  FiveO started reciting blue dot by Carl Sagan, his cadence was spot on for the way Carl spoke.  We all huddled by the fire to keep warm.  Splash told us a story about a missing hiker whom we saw signs about a few weeks earlier.  I remembered seeing an abandoned hammock with food at cold spring shelter.  Apparently hammock belonged to the missing hiker.  There was also a rope going down to a steep water source, however, the real water source was right next to the shelter.  The family said he was suicidal.  We might never know what happened to him...  A great story before I head off to bed.","Pecks Corner Shelter
",Cosby Knob Shelter,"Apr 19, Thu",12.90
Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587738,"Last night was really cold in the shelter.  The fire really didn't heat up the place.  I didn't sleep very well either.  The large group FiveO, Splash, Burger King, and 3 other hikers were a train wreck.  They acted like no one else was in the shelter.  I was sleeping on the bottom area and they were on the top.  During the night one of their shirts hit me in the head and woke me up.  They had gadarade bottles and heavy stuff bags falling from the upper sleeping area.  In the morning I couldn't find my aquamira, I mentioned it, and one of the kids had packed it away.  Apparently FiveO told him to grab everything in sight.  That would be ok if they were the only ones in the shelter.  They also believed they had a right to be loud in the morning since they were a group larger than 5.  Booga and I are going to hike faster than them so we're out of their bubble.
The weather was warmer than yesterday.  There wasn't a cloud in the sky.  We hiked for about 3 miles then another .6 to Mt. Cammerer to a fire lookout.  The lookout was constructed during the 1930s and was retired in the 1960s.  From the tower you could see at least 50 miles out.  We were trying to guess from the top were the trail led next.  We hung out for a awhile and ate our snacks.  It was another 5 mile downhill hike to Davenport gap.  Another mile after that was the northern boundary of The Smokies.  I was sad and happy to leave the park.  I won't see vegetation like that again. It felt like a rain forest up there.  However, it's nice that I can camp anywhere now.  Also the weather should be a little tamer.  
As we approached highway I-40 we saw Miss Janet's van and the train wreck crew.  She was going to slack pack us to standing bear farm hostel.  Before she took off she had us all do a dance across the bridge.  She's filmed us a few times.  I wonder if she has a YouTube channel.  It felt nice not to have 25 pounds sitting on my back over the next mile.  
Standing Bear Farm was built by Curtis Owen.  He hiked the AT and wanted to created a haven for hikers.  The farm itself had this rustic look.  It even had tree houses that you could sleep in.  They had a washboard where you could do your laundry.  Everything you bought was on an honor system.  You'd carry a piece of paper with you and wrote all the things you bought.  They would charge you when you left.
Booga bear and I got a tenting space while we're there.  We didn't realize it was 420.  Standing bear hosts a yearly party for that event.  People were coming in from all over to hang out.  They also brought a pot luck!  I was most excited about the food.  I ate 2 hog dogs, salad, macaroni salad, chicken soup, noodle slaw, a pork sandwich, scalloped potatoes, and a cookie.  My stomach felt like it would explode.  I had trouble drinking my beer because I ate so much food.  They built a stage out back and listened to a cover band.  While we were there Ann and Wizard showed up.  They pushed really hard and did an 18 mile day.  We caught up over the last few days.  Everyone had seen new thru hikers on the trail since the road closure at clingmans dome created a new bubble.  I met a hiker who did 27 miles in one day to make it to the 420 party.  My feet would have fallen apart if I did that many miles.  The band played until dusk and it seemed like the party was winding down around 9.  It's strange that hiker midnight applies to parties out in the back country.  We hung out in the kitchen/common area for a awhile longer.  Pumpkin Spice was reading through AT hiker year books.  You can send your trail name and picture in to have it become part of the year book.  We looked for duplicate names.  One book had 5 people named Rabbit.  
On the way back to my tent there was another fire.  There were was a duo playing guitar, harmonica, and banging on a wooden stump.  Ramble was talking to an older guy who was a bit tipsy.  The older guy talked about catching tuna, but in this loud raspy voice.  His wife tried to get him to calm down since he was right next to the tents.  He was really excited about catching tuna!  I left that group and the duo kept playing on into the night.
I feel asleep to music and the man talking about his tuna.","Cosby Knob Shelter

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587740,"I slept really well last night.  I bet it was from the copious amount off food I ate.  I lounged in my tent until 8:30 am.  That's pretty late for a hiker.  I grabbed my package drop which was are replacement frame for my pack!  Chris from ULA sent it to standing bear for free!  My pack felt whole again.  Booga bear and I hung out in the common kitchen area with Pumkin Spice and Blue Grass.  We waited for 3 full pots of coffee to be brewed.  Each time I filled my cup up.  Pumpkin Spice told us a story about him working in a shipyard in South Korea.  He would work 80 hour days. He asked himself if he wanted to continue working like that. The shipyard would bring in migrate works from China and pay them really low wages.  Suicide was common among that work.  Pumpkin Spice said a worker hung himself from a crane.  They just covered the body and let it hang there all day.  The shipyard was very cold when they called the worker's family.  Pumpkin Spice got out of that job and decided to hike the AT.  
I packed up my tent while contending  with Max the cat.  He would jump up and claw at my rainfly's strings.  I thought he was going to tear a whole in it.  Booga bear and I headed out around 12:15.  It was a straight 5 mile up, then another 8 miles to Max's patch.  Not named after the cat, but it was a huge bald on top of a mountain where you can camp.  At mile 4 we hit our first trail magic!  I took use of their folding chairs as I let my socks dry in the sun.  About a mile earlier blister formed on my heel.  I drank a 20 oz bottle of mountain dew and ate some of my snacks.  They said they had more food but it was all out.  I was happy with the free drink.  After 5 miles of ups and downs we had a 2nd trail magic.  The Smith family whom we've seen in the shelter logs were giving out food.  They gave me a sandwich, chips, candy, granola, beef jerky, and more mountain dew!  I had another 3.5 miles to go and the second sugar rush was kicking in.  I booked it to Max's patch trying to get there before sunset.  On the way to the patch was a box of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and bananas!  When it's the weekend there's trail magic!
I huffed and puffed up to Max's patch.  I made it to 30 minutes before sunset.  Blue Grass, Ramble, Two Crows, Anne, and Wizard were already at the top.  As I walked up I heard them yell YA!  I busted out my PBR as a summit present and watched the sun disappear over the horizon.  I pitched my tent and ate a banana, PB&J, and Pringles for dinner.  I was too lazy to cook dinner.  Sunshine and Forever, a young couple, built a fire.  Booga and I hung around until 9:30, way past hiker midnight.  We talked about all the thru hikers on the trail and trying to guess where they were at.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587855,"I woke up at 2 am to watch the meteor shower.  I couldn't see any of them for the 2 minutes I was outside.  It was cold on the bald and I went back to bed.  I also slept through the sunrise as well.  Booga bear, Wizard, and Ann got up early to watch it.  I already woke up once and wanted to sleep in.  In the morning as I was making my usual oatmeal breakfast a couple gave me a box of trader Joe's peanut butter and chocolate candy.  I shared some with Booga since it was way too much. We headed out around 10 pm and had a long day ahead of us.  We were planning on doing a 16 mile day for a nero then a zero in Hot Springs.  
The trail today looked pretty similar to sections in Georgia.  The Smokies had spoiled us with its microclimate and unpredictable weather.  We had a 1000 foot climb over a mile fallowed by another 1500 descent over 4 miles.  Sadly we didn't run into any trail magic today even though it was still the weekend.  My feet were falling apart.  I started to get more blisters than before.  I don't know if it's the mileage, sock liners, or the lack of washing them.  I got a blister on my left heel and under my big toe on my right foot. Hopefully, my feet will toughen up more.
We hoofed it 16 miles to the shelter.  The shelter as was full but there was plenty of camping. I hung a bear line and setup my tent.  It started getting late but a few hikers started fire.  We said the ghosts at the graveyard in the area were going to come out and haunt us. It stated raining as we were huddled around the fire. I called it a night around 9 pm.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587861,"This morning as the wind was blowing we heard a large crack but no boom.  A tree had fallen but it must have laid up against another tree.  Booga bear, Ann, Wizard, and I packed our packs and headed into town.  We were only 3 miles away.  
The AT cuts right through the center of Hot Springs NC.  There were AT symbols in the sidewalk.  We ate at the Smoky Mountain Dinner.  Out front you could see all the packs laid across the front porch.  It was the first food establishment you come through after being on the trail for 4 days.   We drank at least a pitcher of coffee between us.  I had the skillet breakfast which was featured on southern cooking magazine.  It was pretty massive with home fries, sausage, peppers, eggs, and cheese.  I couldn't finish it all.  We tried getting a place to stay but all the lodges were booked up.  The bubble had taken over everything.  Also the local motel in town had closed for repairs.  
We eventually found some bunk space at the laughing heart hostel.  They had a huge line for laundry about 10 people ahead of us.  We made the most of it by hanging out front and drinking beer.  They had free salad too!  My body had been craving vegetables for awhile.  Jeans and Slayer showed up.  Jeans got more heavy things to add to his pack from Amazon.  Jeans talked about UK politics and all the varieties of tea.  
We eventually put our clothes in the wash.  The hostel had loaner clothes that we could wear while doing laundry.  We found the most ridiculous clothes and headed to the local tavern in town. At the tavern was Miss Janet and Rocking Ronnie.  A lot of hikers don't like Ronnie because of his sexist comments.  I think his reputation has caught up with him on the trail.  Most women have heard about him before even meeting him.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588025,"I slept pretty well in the bunkhouse last night.  I got used to the smell and didn't notice anymore.  Gator had several empty Sprite cans on his top bunk.  In the middle of the night he kicked them to the floor and everyone woke up.  Booga bear and I hung out next to the coffee pot drinking several cups of coffee.  It's like were in a twin peaks episode.  
We headed to the Hillbilly Market and picked up vegetables, eggs, beans, and tortillas. We made breakfast tacos at the hostel.  They were super delicious compared to all the trail and restaurant food we've been eating.  We chilled at the hostel for half of the day not walking.  Apache appeared just off the trail.  His legs were covered in scabs and his shoes were falling apart.  It seemed like he'd been doing some heavy miles.  I heard a story that Apache had jumped out of a moving vehicle when their driver had made a joke about him jumping out.  
We made reservations for the hot springs spa.  They pump in natural hot spring water into hot tubs.  Anne, Wizard, Booga Bear, and I asked a few people in the hostel if they wanted to join.  We quickly had a crew of 7 people.  We picked up beer and snacks along the way.  When we got there they gave us our own private tub.  It felt amazing to soak or aching muscles from all the hiking we've been doing.  The tub time was only for an hour but we had finished a whole case of beer during that time.  Eli and Alex were two vagabonds just hitching around the east coast.  They were not thru hiking but did hike some of the trail.  
After the tub soak we headed to the iron horse station for dinner.  We saw Miss Janet there with a few other hikers.  I devoured my hamburger and vegetables.  We picked up more beer on the way back to the hostel.  On the back porch at the hostel, Jeff the hostel manager put on some classic rock. He passed around a jar of moonshine for everyone to try.  It was way stronger than the stuff in Gatlinburg.

I stuffed my pack with 5 days of food since the next resupply will be in Erwin Tennessee about 65 miles away.  The pack was pretty heavy with all that food.  Booga bear cooked up the rest of the vegetables and we devoured more breakfast tacos.  They were still better than the restaurant food we had been eating.  
We stopped at the outfitters to refuel then hit the trail.  The trail fallowed the river for a little while out of Hot Springs.  Then it was a steep climb up out of the valley.  On the way up we ran into Two Crows, Last Spot, Ann, and Wizard.  Two Crows and Last Spot had packed out 6 beers each.  That was way too much weight.  They ended up drinking 4 of them right on the ascent.  We kept trudging up the mountain.  There was scattered rain today.  It seemed like every time we put on our rain gear the rain stopped.  When we removed our gear the rain started again.  We couldn't win!  Booga, Wizard, and I bought rain skirts at the outfitters.  They kept our legs from sweating too much and our pants dry.  It was funny that all the men got skirts.  Ann had rain pants.  We met Amazonian and Francis on the trail.  Amazonian got her name because she was tall.  
We finally made it to the campsite around 5 pm.  We only did 7 miles but my feet started hurting because of all the food weight.  Near the campsite there was an old fire tower.  We didn't go up it because the steps were falling apart.  At the site, we saw Dragon, Yelp, and Scissors.  They had a fire already going.  They started grilling sausages on the fire.  It made my beef stroganoff dehydrated meal look sad.  Luckily someone couldn't finish their sausage and I gladly ate it.  Yelp got his tail name when a soldier with a rifle snuck near his tent earlier on.  It was lightning and he only saw the silhouette outside his tent and let out a Yelp!  The trail fallows an army training facility in some areas.  He told us that he slept with a gaterade bottle to relieve himself inside his tent.  He never did like leaving his tent to use the bathroom.  Scissors talked about Rocking Ronnie and how he made derogatory comments about her one night while she was laying in her tent.  He approached her in the tavern in Hot Springs and she told him to never speak to her again.  We're trying to get his name changed to Rotten Ronnie.  I hope it catches on.

In the morning I ate a large breakfast to try to cut down on the weight.  I had peanut butter on tortilla as well as oatmeal.  Theresa made the oatmeal from scratch.  It had chocolate and dried raspberries.  It was super filling and tasty.  Surprisingly most of the people were still in their tents around 8:30.  I'm used to an empty landscape when I wake up. This crew is more of my style.  We headed out shortly after.
We stopped at the first shelter to eat some more grub and filter water.  An older woman showed up with a Shiba Inu but with a dark coloring that I hadn't seen before.  Most look like foxes but this one looked like a little bear which was also its trail name.  From the shelter it was easy going until I felt a drop then another.  I didn't want to put on my rain gear only to have to take it off shortly after.  However today the rain didn't stop.  It kept raining for most of the day.  The rain skirt kept my shorts dry!  In about 2 miles I came to a gap with a handwritten sign that said mom and dad shop 100 feet.  I went up check it out.  It was a dilapidated building that had boards over most of the windows.  The inside was really dark but they were selling junk food, soda, and beer. I picked up a Snickers and a PBR.  Scissors stopped in to tell me that she was going to a hostel down the road.  After Scissors left the man at the mom and dad mentioned that women talked a lot.  I told him that wasn't true and was just a generalization.  
After leaving the shop it was about a 5 mile climb to the shelter in the rain.  The trail was slick mud all the way up.  It made it difficult to finish miles as I couldn't keep my footing.  I ate my lunch in the rain.  My tortilla was half filled with rain water as I added the filling.  It was a sad lunch.  
I finally made it to the shelter around 5 pm.  Booga bear, Ann, and Wizard were already there. The shelter was full so I had to pitch my tent.  I setup my tent in the rain trying not to get the internal area wet by setting the rain fly first.  It mostly worked.  About 20 minutes later the rain stopped... figures.  I hung out by the shelter making a taco Mac n cheese dinner.  Amazonian, Francis, Mountain goat, and his mom were in the shelter.  After dinner I really had to use the privy except it was so close to the shelter that you could make eye contact with everyone in the shelter.  Also the stall walls only came up to your hips with no front door.  I made eye contact with Booga bear as I was using it.  What a treat!

I felt like smashing the bag with my boot, but I let him live to steal food another day.  Amazonian had the same issue with her food bag.  The mice here are well fed.  
Luckily the rain stopped around 9 pm. We eventually rolled out of the shelter around 11.  It was slow going.  The trail was a muddy mess from the rain.  It was difficult to gain traction.  It caused us to use more energy as we hiked.  Eventually, we climbed up onto the ridgeline.  Except the whole mile was rock scrambling.  It took us longer than expected to get across those rocks. We were treated to gorgeous views of the valley below.  The sun was shining through the clouds.  
We made it to the first shelter and hung up our tents to dry.  The power of the sun really dries out a tent fast.  The shelter was called Jerry's cabin and it had been cleaned up by him.  He hauled garbage bags full of trash from the site and installed a fake telephone and light bulb for fun.  It was the first shelter with a cat!  We called the cat Jerry and believed that it housed his spirit.  It cried for food from hikers and was given food in return.  It went into Booga bear's trash bag and stole an empty cheez it bag.  I bet this shelter didn't have any mice!  They definitely need a cat at the last shelter.  When our stuff finally dried we hit the trail again for the next shelter.  
There were huge flat balds after the shelter.  They were pretty easy to hike since they were really flat.  There was another short climb and we arrived at big butt mountain.  It had a large rounded rock at the top with a crack going straight through the center.  It was big I cannot lie!
We heard that the next shelter was contaminated with giardia or the noravirous.  Some people had vomited in the shelter.  We were planning on camping before or after it since we didn't want to get sick.  On the way there we saw Jeans and Slayer camping on a small bald.  We decided to stop there even though we still had some miles to go before we rolled into Erwin.  
Booga bear tried to set a bear line but got his line stuck in the tree.  I found a large stick to help him pull his line down.  Amazonian, Francis, and Jaipur showed up.  We were all really surprised to see Jaipur since we hadn't seen him in days.  He just shows up out of nowhere sometimes.  Jeans and Booga bear failed at making a fire.  The sticks were just too wet.  We needed the hiker Wet Sticks to help us out.  He's so good that he can start a fire with water.  We all hung out eating our grub.  9 pm rolled around and hiker midnight set in.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588344,"I woke up today pretty well rested.  My feet were feeling better as well.  I heard two people outside my tent at 7:30.  It was Forgiven and Sunshine.  They started hiking at 5:30 in the morning to do some night hiking.  They were trying to catch up with their original tramily.  Jeans and Slayer headed out with them.  I took my time making breakfast.  We were planning on an 18 mile day.
We headed out at 9 pm.  The first 3 miles were gradual and easy.  I got to the flint rock shelter that apparently had noravirous.  It was empty and the shelter seemed like a great place to stay except the Nora.  From the shelter we went another 5 miles. It was the weekend and were were hoping for some trail magic.  The first road we came to didn't have any magic but a large open field with dandelions.  We stretched and lounged in the grass for a little while.  I could have slept there all afternoon.  From that gap we came to another crossing with a sign for Laurel hostel that advertised beer and pizza.  We were sold.  When we arrived a small dog named Oreo came out barking at us.  We tried to calm him down but it took him awhile to get used to us.  The hostel was nothing more than a shack with a few bunk beds.  The guy running the place sold us totinos pizzas and PBR.  We hung out there for an hour and drank another PBR. The hostel had signs about 2nd  amendment rights.  I wouldn't want to steal from that place!  From the hostel was the real climb of the day.  It wasn't as bad as some of the others we'd had before.  We huffed up the mountain halfway to find Jaipur taking a nap on his air mattress.  We caught our breath and moved onto the summit.  At the top, we cracked open our beers that we had been packing out.  It was refreshing.  We marched another 3 miles to the next shelter.  Jaipur and Santiago showed up a few minutes later.  The water source there was about .2 miles away.  It seemed to take forever to get to it. 
We headed another 2.4 to Sams gap.  Someone going south had told us about trail magic there.  Unfortunately, it was too late when we got there.  We hiked another mile and a half to our camping spot.  It was a 16 mile day.  My feet were sore, but nothing else hurt.  I put up my tent and tried to hang my beer line.  It took me a few tries and I scraped up my legs from the briars in the area.  I made my dinner then rolled into my tent.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588504,"This morning was pretty cold but at least the wind stopped.  I ate my usual breakfast of oatmeal that was made by Theresa.  We hit the trail at 9:30.  Upon leaving we saw Comicazi and Theo walking down the trail.  She said there was trail magic with pancakes and coffee.  However it was 1.5 miles behind us.  We were not going to walk backwards.
It was a pretty steep climb but the reward was well worth it.  I could see it from miles away, Big Bald mountain.  From the top you could see a 360 view of the mountains. Theo and Comicazi showed up.  Theo the dog was rolling over over the ground because his pack itched.  Eventually a treat fell out of the pack and he scarfed it down. I believe he was really going for that.  We headed out and found a discarded tennis ball on the bald.  Theo was super happy to have a new toy!  
On the little bald we saw the remains of a chimney that belonged to Hog Greer.  A hermit who lived on the bald in the early 1800s.  He was scorned by a woman and left for the mountains.  He declared his own domain over the mountain and was a nuisance to the townsfolk.  The government tried to bring him to court for tax evasion.  He ended up breaking all the windows in the courthouse.  He was eventually shot in the back by a blacksmith.  They say his ghost still haunts the bald.  
We trekked it to the bald mountain shelter for lunch.  We met a southbounder named House Keeping.  We picked his brain about the trail ahead.  He said Pennsylvania was pretty tough from all the sharp rocks.  As we left the bald we saw Beats approaching.   He always has music playing as he's hiking.  You can hear him coming from a mile away.  
From the shelter it was still another 10 miles to the next shelter.  We passed a few gaps then approached Spivey Gap.  A woman came up from there and said there was Taco Bell trail magic in the gap.  It was close to 3:00 and I took off running down the mountain.  Booga bear, Ann, and Wizard had been talking about Taco Bell for the last few days.  I really wanted it!  I ran down the trail as fast as I could. When I arrived at the gap there was no one there.  Two missed trail magics today. :(
We took off for the last leg until the shelter.  It was a tougher hike without that wonderful trail magic.   The shelter also didn't have a bear line, water, or privy. It was the saddest shelter we've.  At the shelter we ran into Jeans and Slayer.  Jeans gave Booga bear and I ramen from yesterday's trail magic.  We were going to eat a cold dinner since we didn't have any left.  It was amazing to have a hot dinner.  We saw Yelp and talked about bodily functions.  We're that comfortable with each other.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589062,"Last night my air mattress decided to fall apart.  The internal seems started coming apart.  Everytime one separated it let out a loud boom.  The mattress looked like it had a goiter.  I packed up my stuff and we headed off to Erwin.
The 6 mile trek into town was all downhill.  We got amazing views of the Nolichucky river.  We arrived at Uncle Johnny's Nolichucky Hostel around 11:30.  I picked up my sister's package drop.  She sent Booga and I a chacud party with the full spread of cheese, summer sausage, crackers, and wine!  She also sent me some other snacks as well some good instant coffee.  It was a great surprise for our town day.
From the hostel we rented bikes and headed to Taco Bell and the laundry mat.  We stopped by the gas station for tall boys for the bike ride.  Erwin surprisingly had a biking trail to downtown and it fallowed the Nolichucky river. We've been talking about Taco Bell for days.  We loaded up on tacos, burritos, and crunch wrap supremes.  We took some hot sauce packets to pack out as well.  We hit the laundry next. Jeans and Slayer were already doing laundry there.  We hung out in our rain coats and skirts.  Booga was sitting outside in his outfit when a bus of children went by.  He made sure to cross his legs!  After 6 days it was amazing to have clean clothes again.  I was excited to have clean socks so I wouldn't get blisters.  We booked it back to the hostel to catch the 5 pm shuttle to Walmart.  At Wally world I was overwhelmed with the amount of choice I had to buy stuff.  It was hard not to buy too much.  Booga, Spineli, and Wizard went to the liquor store for tonight's festivities.  The shuttle came back 2 hours later and we all crammed in.  I sat closest to the door and felt that I was going to fall out. 
We got back to the hostel and put together a meal of chacud, salad, hummus, grapes, pickles, mixed nuts, wine, cocktails, and beer.  I had my fill of food and lounged around in our cabin.  We got the heater going.  It was warm and cozy compared to the last few nights.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589064,"Booga, Spineli, Wizard, and I woke up in a warm cabin this morning.  We slept in until 10 am then packed up our mess.  I ate some of the food my sister sent me so I'd carry less weight on the climb out of Erwin.     We were planning on having a nero today and only hiking 4 miles.  At the hostel the septic broke and we couldn't use the bathroom.  Wizard and I rode bikes to the Citgo station so we wouldn't have to dig a cathole.  On the way there Wizard got flat tire.  There was a screw directly in the center of the tire.  I walked back with Wizard to the hostel.  Luckily it was only a mile away.
We lounged around the hostel for awhile.  We needed to rest our feet from our 65 mile trek from hot springs.  We hung out with a few people who we've been seeing over the last few days.  Lorax was applying for teaching positions in the fall.  She was editing cover letters on her phone and sending them out.  I couldn't image trying to apply for a job while hiking.  
We got a late start on the trail around 4:30 pm.  The start of the trail crossed the Nolichucky river and the railroad.  Spineli was hiking in front when suddenly she slipped and fell off the side of the trail.  Luckily some trees stopped her fall.  She didn't break or twist anything but had a few scrapes on her hands and legs.  We waited while she bandaged herself up then we headed out again.  
The last mile and a half to the shelter was a steep uphill.  It seemed to go on forever.  Shortly after the climb I could see the shelter.  It was a lot bigger than the others since it was renovated in 2010.  We metup with Amazonian and Francis there.  Spineli and Wizard didn't show.  We assumed that they stealth camped earlier on the trail.  
We made dinner and hung up our bangs.  It looks like there might be mice in the shelter tonight.  I hope they don't run over my face!","

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589115,"Last night it felt like my air mattress was going to throw me off the top bunk of the shelter.  The bubble that has been forming has gotten so large that it resembles a small pillow.  When laying on it, the bubble pushes me to the head of the mattress and to the edge of the top bunk.  I ended up moving my mattress sideways so it didn't feel like I was going to fall off.  Booger bear and I packed up and ate breakfast.  As we were eating Spineli and Wizard showed up.     They had camped next to the river about a mile before the shelter.  
We headed out around 10:15.  It was a sunny day and it only got hotter.  At Indian grave gap we met Brother Tom who usually does trail magic most days.  I had coffee, lemonade, and a homemade brownie.  It was a great pick me up for the next climb in the heat of the day.  In 2 miles we came to beauty meadow.  It was a large bald on the mountain.  I had a snack there and rested my feet.  At the next water source, I met up with my crew again.  Two Crows and Last Spot showed up.  Two Crows told us a story about him meeting a girl who drove him to Ashville, took him to the grocery store, then let him spend the night at her place.  He said they shared a bottle of wine then he went to sleep in the guest room. In the morning she left him the WiFi password as well as some Epson salts for a bath.  We felt that he changed the story about the guest room.  Next time we'll call him out.  
The next section was the hottest hike of the day.  As we climbed Unaka Mountain we were cooked by the sun's rays.  The trees in the mountains didn't have leaves yet and we were left shadeless.  When we reached the top we were greeted by a spruce decorated in Christmas ornaments.  It was a memorial for Max who passed away a few years ago.  The dense spruce forest provided shade from the sun.  In another 4 miles we were at the shelter.  
We hung out with Amazonian and Francis.  We learned that Francis was hard of hearing.  Which made sense now when Amazonian repeated phrases to him.  I tried eating a lot of my food for dinner but failed. I filled up too fast on pasta sides.
Tonight I setup my tent without the rain fly so I could see the stars.  There is a dog or a cayote howling in the distance.  Luckily I only hear one.","Curley Maple Gap Shelter

I got to the first shelter around 12:15.  Booga, Spineli, and Wizard were already there hanging out.  I took a long 2 hour lunch and stretched my legs.  My heels have been hurting me now and it could be plantar fasciitis setting in.  I'll need to make sure to stretch my hamstrings.  I don't have the luxury of taking off a few months for it to heal.  I'll be getting my chacos in Damascus.  Hopefully that will help.  
After the shelter I pushed another 3 miles to Hughes gap and had a chat with Theresa.  She will try to come see me twice!  Once in May then June.  I'm excited to see her.  I started the climb to Roan mountain.  It's the last mountain that could have snow for the spring season.  It was a gradual climb over 3 miles to ash gap.  I met a few people camping in that area.  There was a woman that used to work at Whole Foods corporate office in Austin.  She showed me the back of her foot with a giant torn blister.  She said she didn't feel a thing since she had her vertebrae fused years earlier.  I showed her how to tie her boots so that her heel wouldn't slip and cause more blisters.  
I left ash gap and pushed another 3 miles to the shelter.  On the way there was a large clearing where a hotel once stood from the early 1900s.  There was only a foundation left.  When I reached the shelter the squad was there.  I wouldn't be sleeping in the shelter tonight since I heard it was infested with rats.  I only saw evidence of mice though.  I cooked a late dinner and ate couscous and a sandwich.

We set out around 9 am for the party barn shelter.  It was a barn that was turned into a shelter that could fit 60 people in it.  We descended Roan mountain to find trail magic!  They were giving out chips, soda, homemade cookies, and hot dogs.  Except they were still constructing the grill when we got there. From the parking lot we set out for the mountain balds.  There were going to be several today with excellent views.  Each bald had a different 360 view of the surrounding area.  We could see for several miles in either direction.
We pushed on and arrived at the party barn around 1 pm.  Sometimes the care taker would bring beer, but sadly, not today.  There were stories of beer being there a day ago.  We all ate a large lunch and hung out for awhile.  It was the heat of the day and we didn't plan on leaving until 4 pm. We would be hiking over little hump and big hump mountains after the party barn.  
The climb out from the barn was straight up a bald.  I was glad it was a little cooler.  On the way up big bad there were several false summits.  I always thought we were at the top but then realized we had to climb some more.  The views were spectacular from big hump mountain.  From there the trail fell apart with roots and large rocks.  It all hurt my feet going down.  
When we arrived at Doll Flats we saw Jeans and Slayer getting ready to pass out.  I think they are trying to get up early tomorrow to beat the rain.  Dragon and Yelp had a large fire already going.  We did our camp chores then hung out by the fire.  The conversation degraded into bodily functions by the end of the night.  It was time to call it.  Tonight I'll be listening for the rain.","Roan High Knob Shelter

We had a short hike today down to Roan town.  It was a gradual 3 miles to the road and was pretty easy.  When we arrived there was a shuttle already there to take us to the station hostel.  We were planning on going to town but the hostel had beer and the town was dry.  It was an easy decision.  We hung out there for 2 hours waiting for the shuttle to town.  I had a cup of coffee and hung around updating my journal.
We first stopped at the bakery for lunch.  They had a wood fired oven for making pizzas.  We ordered 5 pizzas for the 4 of us because it was buy 4 get 1 free.  5 pizzas is no match for 4 hungry hikers.  We killed those pizzas.  We walked into town and first stopped at the thift store. Spineli found and flowered Hawaiian shirt for Booger Bear that fit him and his style perfectly.  We ran across the street picked up our resupply, got milkshakes at Bob's dairyland, then got a shuttle back to the hotel.
Booger bear was waiting for the Kentucky Derby to start.  He has hosted a party for it for several years.  This was the first time he wasn't in Austin but told his parents that he would find a TV to watch it.  Pumpkin Spice showed up.  We haven't seen him for 150 miles.  It seemed that he struck up a trailmance with Poncho.  It was the first one that I have seen on the trail.  Scissors showed up next.  We all hung out in the common room in the hostel catching up over the last few weeks.  Pumpkin Spice told us of an older woman named Pathfinder who was hiking the trail at 76.  She had problems climbing the mountains and learned to ask for help from fellow hikers to help her carry her stuff.  Her late husband told her that life was too short before he passed away and she had wanted to hike the trail since she was 50.  She was determined to do it even if it meant struggling to hike.  Pumpkin Spice had carried her pack 3 miles including his to Neels Gap.  He then hadn't heard of her since.  He admired her determination even though the cards were stacked against her.
The derby kicked off while a group of us was playing cards against humanity.  I got a large plate of BBQ that hostel had been preparing all day.  The commissioner of Roan town setup a karaoke booth and everyone started singing.  Then the guitars came out and everyone started jamming.  Rotten Ronnie appeared and started playing as well. He's been pretty tame over the last few weeks.  I wonder if his reputation has caught up with him.

We started hiking around 9:30 then it started raining.  It only rained for an hour then stopped.  We've been lucky with the wet weather.  The trail was pretty easy compared to the other sections.  When there was an up it was only for 100 feet.  When down, it was gradual.  However, it still felt like a lot because we were tired.  
We stopped for lunch at Jones falls it was one of larger waterfalls we've seen since Amicalola Falls.  It seemed that it was everyone's idea to eat lunch there.  The area was cooler from all the mist coming off the rocks.  From the waterfall, it was another 4 miles to the shelter.  When we arrived Wolfman was already there.  Grandpa showed up and built a raging fire in 5 minutes.  He's 65 and has been hiking the trail for 7 years.  It seemed he had energy of a 20 year old.  Using trees as leverage he was snapping branches the thickness of my legs with ease.  Sketch is another character who has 6000 miles of hiking on the AT.  He's in his 50s but looks older than Grandpa.  He's been smoking for 35 years and has had a few strokes on the trail this year.   He was having some kind of episode today but he just needed his Coke and cigarette.  His plan is to die on the trail with a beer and cigarette in hand.  I feel sorry for anyone who comes apon his corpse on the trail.  Plus someone will need to come and pack out his body.  
On the lighter side Chuckles was climbing a laurel to hang a beer bag.  The laurel started falling over.  We were watching in slow motion as he hit the ground.  He was ok and it was pretty funny.  The talk around the fire degraded to poop talk as it always does.  Someone described all the different ways you can squat when doing your  business.  The girls displayed the buddy system where you are back to back or you hold hands and make deep eye contact.  I knew at this point it was time to go to bed.

The trail today was really easy.  There were not any real hard climbs.  On the side of the trail I saw dead morel mushrooms.   They must have died a few weeks ago.  There were hundreds of dead ones.   I went searching for any live ones but none could be found.  I eventually caught up with Spineli, Wizard, and Booger Bear at the shelter.  I ate my lunch of English muffins, spam, and cheese.  Peter Pan showed up in his green hat, but he was also wearing a dress.  It was the same dress that Spineli wore while doing laundry at the station hostel!  She said ""Hey!  You're wearing my dress!"". He felt very emasculated after that.  We started calling him Tinker Bell instead.  
After lunch I headed out for the remaining 6 miles today.   It was still gradual with those dead morels.  I didn't find any live ones today.  Booger bear and I came to the access road to Kincora Hostel.  The hostel was ran by a veteran named Bob.  He had been doing it for 23 years and also maintained this section of the trail.  I grabbed two mail drops from him.  One was my replacement air mattress for the one that had a bubble in it.  The other was a care package from my parents.  They sent me wine, liquor, deer jerky, purell, and protein bars.   It was an excellent package.  Too bad we can't drink the wine yet since Kincora is a dry hostel.   We'll have to wait until tomorrow.  
We all hung out in the common room and chatted with everyone.  Bob did a grocery store run that Booga and I missed.  Everyone came back with tasty pizzas to cook.  Luckily Sketch and his crew made burgers, goolash, and boiled veggies.   It we better than the pasta sides we were going to make.  Two Crows busted out ice cream and I devoured a bowl.  The door to the common room needed to remain closed since there were 11 cats at the hostel.  There was only 1 cat allowed inside.  Bob told us a story about a girl named Hyper who hiked in 1999.  She was the most fit hiker he had ever seen.  It turns out she was a bronze gold medalist for downhill skiing.  We hung out in the common room until 10 pm.  It was late.

From Dunkin, I packed out an everything bagel with cream cheese.  If you have a chance, always pack out if you can!  Bob took us back to the hostel and we packed up and headed out for the trail.
The trail today was flat for the first few miles.  We ran into The Smith family again for a small bit of trail magic.  They gave us sodas for our lunch.  I told them when I ran down the mountain to get Taco Bell trail magic from them.  Only to find that they had left. Then we came upon Laurel Falls. I was one of the wider falls we've seen.  I took off my shoes and rested them in the cold flowing water.  The water was soothing my ankles from the several days of hiking.  I ate my bagel and drank my soda.  We headed out for the large climb on the day.  The bridges built in the area were quality.  Bob had told us that he and his team put a lot work in that area.  The switch backs were gradual and clear.  The climb as was about 1500 feet over 3 miles.  At the top, trees blocked the view and we took a break to eat lunch.  I ate an English muffin with peanut butter and Fritos on top.  Surprisingly not bad.  It was another 3 miles downhill until we arrived at Boots Off hostel near the trail.
The hostel was well maintained.  They had bunkhouses, cabins, and tenting areas.  We all opted for a tenting area since it was the cheapest.  Booger Bear and I were planning on jumping in the lake, but the shuttle was also running at the same time.   We had to do our resupply for our stretch to Damascus.  It also started raining and put the kabash on that idea.  
The food run was pretty hectic.  They used an SUV to haul several people to a Subway, McDonald's, and Dollar General a few miles away.  The SUV could fit 11 people at one time.  There were about 30 people needing to do a food run.  Booger Bear and I were on the last run. The driver was swerving down the driveway.  It didn't seem that he cared that there was a full car with people.  We stopped at Subway first.  Booger bear and I got subs with all the veggies.   We got beer at the Shell station and garbage resupply food at Dollar General.  The driver came back and told us it was the last shuttle back to the hostel.  There were 14 of us and one dog.  We ended up stacked in the SUV.  The dog didn't like being smushed in the back.
When we got back to the hostel.  We chowed down on Subway and split a pizza as well.  We hung out in the common area until midnight.  I met a German woman named Brick who talked about the issues going on in her country with refugees coming in.  She felt that people were not speaking up about what was going on.  She mentioned about moving to Paraguay to get away from her home country.  After that talk I was drained and ready to go to bed.

They loaded up the SUV with the kayaks and paddle boards.  We went out to Watauga lake and got in.  I almost fell into the water trying to get into my Kayak.  Luckily Chill held the kayak in place so I could get in.  On the lake there was a small island with herons nesting. They had made the whole island their nesting ground.  Chuckles decided to stand on his kayak and he toppled into the water.  It was pretty funny since the water was freezing.  We could see where we'd be hiking tomorrow from the lake.  It didn't seem like that crazy of a climb.  We paddled over to the beach area where we met up with Kamikaze and Poncho.  It felt great to jump in the water when we got there.  Chill, Chuckles, Pumpkin Spice, and Scissors all started paddle board wars on the water.  Chill was really good at staying on his board.  Then they got into yoga wars. Scissors tried to do a happy baby but ended up rolling right off the board into the water.  While hanging out, we saw Yelp, Dragon, Amazonian, and Francis show up.  Dragon busted out his frisbee and threw it around.  Theo joined the game except he would carry the frisbee all the way to the other side of the beach were Kamikaze was hanging out.  We eventually packed up our stuff and headed back to the hostel.  We made another dinner food run and it was a lot more tame than yesterday.  
I hung out in the common area eating a Subway sandwich with all the veggies and cooked a digorno pizza to pack out for tomorrow.  I met Ghost and Metric who kept talking about themselves and how many miles they were doing.  Lorax was there also but she seemed half heartly in the conversation.  Ghost got his name because he would sneak up behind people on the trail.  Metric got his name because he told someone that their pack was a metric shit ton.  They were not really fun to talk to.  I talked to Caveman for a bit.  He and his girlfriend have been doing work for stays at different hostels in the area.  I remembered him from standing bear.  He was wearing the exact same clothes as last time.  It was close to midnight by this time and I was ready for bed.  
Tonight I'm sleeping in my tent at a downward agle.  It's not so bad.","Boots Off Hostel

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589985,"Today I woke up to find a tick crawling towards my tent.  They are everywhere down here.  I'm not sure what is causing them to spread.  I flicked them off the rain fly.  I was packing my up my sleeping bag when it started to rain.  If I was 15 min earlier I could have had my tent packed up before the rain.  The rain stopped but I was left with a wet rain fly.  I didn't really feel hungry this morning because I ate a footlong Subway sandwich and some pizza the night before.  I just had coffee and a banana for lunch.  
We headed out around 10:15 to start our hike.  The hike from Boots Off Hostel led directly to the lake.  At the lake beach there was trail magic!  I made room for a homemade donut and some capri sun.  The person doing trail magic had thru hiked the previous year.  From the beach the trail fallowed the lake for a few miles.  People were out fishing and they didn't say anything to us.  They probably didn't want us to scare the fish away.  We passed the closed Watauga Lake Shelter.  It has been closed due to aggressive bear activity since 2016.  A few miles from there we took a break at the Watauga dam.  It had a great view of the lake and the surrounding mountains.  From there it was a climb up an access road then more climbing over 5 miles.  Towns are always in the valleys and there's always a climb out. It worse because we always had a full bag of food and supplies.  After the huge climb we stopped at Vandeventer shelter.  It had a view of the valley from a cliff.  I drank my packed out 20 oz beer and pizza.  I also ate 3 receeses cups, Snickers, and some cheez its.  I talked to Scissors about her job as a Operating room tech.  She said during operations people would have conversations about anything from the weather to drama at work.  The only time people would stop talking if the surgeon was having a difficult time with a procedure.  Bandito also worked in a hospital as a person who records the doctors diagnosis with notes at the hospital.  
After lunch, I felt super tired but we pushed another 4 miles to a campsite.  It looked like it was going to rain, there was even a few drops coming down.  Suddenly, the clouds opened and it was blue and sunny again.  Backcountry weather is mysterious sometimes.  We made it to the campsite around 6 pm.  I made camp and ate a dinner of 4 cheese mashed potatoes and buffalo sauce tuna.  It wasn't that bad.  I shared my dad's venison jerky with the crew around the fire.  The snack pack crew also had smores for dessert.  Theo ate one without chocolate as well.  We called it a night around hiker midnight.
Tonight I'm cozy in my tent.  The weather is calm and clear.  It's going to be a good night.","Watauga Lake

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590807,"This morning laziness kicked in and I didn't really want to get out of my tent.  It was warm and cozy.  Everything was dry too.  As I lounged it suddenly started raining and my rain fly was wet once again.  The rain stopped after 5 minutes.  I ate poptarts and coffee for breakfast.  Theo made sure to visit each of us even if we were at a different part of the camp site.
The hike today was pretty flat.  We were hiking along the ridgeline.  It did get up into the 80s as well.  I talked to Scissors and Pumpkin Spice for a few hours about traveling and lack of diversity on the trail.  We've mostly seen a monochromic class view since most people hiking are from the same social economic class.  If you see most hiking ads they only depict Caucasians.  Someone of color would see that as something not from them.  Also hiking in the south through small towns, they could run into more racism.  There are probably other reasons but I feel that the trail should be inclusive of all.
Scissors mentioned that she wanted to work in other cities for a few months since her job allowed her to do that.  She could get a feel for a place.  Pumpkin Spice also talked about traveling from place to place.  I mentioned I was more in a place were I wanted to stay in one area because jumping around doesn't allow you to create those close friendships.  However, being on the trail brings people closer together faster.  I knew from my experiences as an expact that people of the same group in a similar situation creates closer friendships faster than if they live in their respective cities in the states.
We talked about different religions and how other cultures viewed the world.   Scissors had an assignment in Katmandu Nepal and mentioned seeing Sadhus and thought they were homeless people.  Sadhus live that life by choice and have renounced the worldly life.  
On the trail we came to a large pasture with Creeping Buttercup flowers everywhere. It seemed like a great place to nap except it was totally exposed to the sun.  We heard that there were cows but we didn't see any for a half mile.  In the last pasture there was a heard of them grazing.  They looked at us with minimal interest.  There were also about 4 or 5 baby calf's.  I mentioned the time I went to the Minnesota state fair.  They had a miracle of birth barn that showed a variety of animals giving birth.  There were huge LCD screens that showed the births of the day.  
We took lunch at a shady spot.  I had lemon pepper tuna on a tortilla with cheez its. Kamikaze and Theo showed up.  Theo was happy to have his pack off.  He kept flipping over and rubbing his back.  As he shifted from side to side on his back he scooted downhill.   It was really funny.  We all took naps in the shade and then headed on.  
I hiked for a bit with Kamikaze and talked about what caused her to hike the AT.  She had no intention of hiking but after the loss of Matt her life took a 180.  She had a house and a stable job.  After Matt passed away, that all fell apart.  She left her job and lost her house.  On night she had the urge to put together the site for Matt called Matt's Purple Bandana.  http://mattspurplebandana.org. It's a site to raise opiate awareness.  Kamikaze also has purple bandanas to give out for her cause.  I'm glad she's on the trail spreading awareness.
We stopped at low gap tonight just 5 miles shy of the next shelter.  We've done enough today and it's time to hit the hay.","Campsite past Vandeventer shelter

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590820,"This morning I woke up early but ended up hanging out in my tent until 8:30.  We were planning on getting into Damascus today.  I drank coffee with Irish cream that my parents gave me in a drop package.  Scissors and I talked about relationships and how it's hard to forget about someone you loved.  She had a woman in her life that couldn't commit to her.  I could relate to that from previous experience.
At the other campsite Kamikaze and Theo had already left.  The trail today was supposed to be pretty flat except the weather is going to be 84 degrees.  I wasn't looking forward to hot weather.  It causes my feet to sweat more and gives me blisters.
We hiked 5 miles to the Abingdon shelter.  The water source was about .3 miles down a steep hill and there wasn't another source for 8 miles.  Scissors and I snacked there for a bit.  I decided to get water since it was only going to get hotter.  I grabbed an extra liter for Scissors, but when I got back to the shelter she had already taken off.  That's where I met Pippen, Honey legs, and Zach.  They were part of the crusty tall squaches crew.  Pippen was from Cincinnati and we talked about how the city has revitalized over the past 10 years.  Honey legs was from Taylor Texas which is close to Austin.  We both agreed there wasn't anything to do in Taylor.
I continued on from the shelter for another 4 miles and received a text from Scissors that she had met up with Kamikaze.  They were 1.6 miles from the Tennessee Virginia border and were going to meet up with me to cross it.  When I got there Scissors didn't have much water left.  I shared the extra liter that I had been carrying.  It was really hot to not be carrying much water.  We headed to the border and got photos then headed to Damascus.  
When we reached town it was a transition from the trail to perfectly manicured lawns.  It would be amazing to camp on all that soft grass instead of the mud pads we sometimes slept on.  We fallowed the blazes through town.  Damascus is a super hiker town.  They had murals everywhere about hiking.  
We stopped at the Woodchuck hostel and checked in.  They sold Ben and Jerry's by the pint.  Scissors, Kamikaze, and I both bought one.  We had been talking about ice cream since we crossed the border.  We also ran into Pumpkin Spice, Bandito, and Pancho at the hostel.  They were hanging out and doing laundry.  We put our clothes in the wash and did the same.  I found some epic town clothes.  Jeans shorts and a sleeveless t-shirt from an old radio show.  That it outfit would be the talk of the town!  
I headed to the brewery in my town clothes.  We met up with Wizard, Spineli, and Booger Bear there.  They had live music and pretty cheap beer.  We all hung around for a bit.  Everyone got a kick out of my town clothes.  After the brewery I stopped for late night snacks from Food City.  Booger Bear was there doing the same.  He had cut a lot of weight from his backpack for his summer shakedown.  He mentioned heading out in the morning.  I still needed to do town business and wasn't going to leave until late afternoon.  I headed back to the hostel and filled up on grocery grub.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590849,"I woke up this morning with the dew on my sleeping bag.  Luckily it was going to be a clear day so I hung up my sleeping bag to dry.  The hostel provided us a breakfast of eggs, blueberry waffles, potatoes, and coffee.  It was the best hostel breakfast I had ever had.  It really hit the spot.  
We lounged lounged around the hostel for awhile then headed to Mojo's for lunch. The cafe had great coffee and sandwichs.  I ran into Pippen and Honey legs there.  Pippen and I talked about fixing bikes.  I mentioned my volunteering at bike co-ops.
Outside a woman sat down with us who had been fallowing Kamikaze though Facebook.  She had issues with boyfriend Kevin and his opiate abuse.  We could all relate to her since we know of someone who has gone through it or has lost someone to it.  Most times an addict is trying to fill a void with drugs.   It could be from lack of love and acceptance from family members.  It seems that there is a common story between people with addiction problems.  The important thing though is to always show love for that person no matter what.  When the love is lost it will be harder for that person to recover.
We headed back to the hostel and stopped by the two outfitters on the way.  I was looking for a new sleeping bag for the summer but didn't find any that fit me fine.  We then headed to the hostel, picked up Rolly Pollly, and headed to the old mill for dinner.  It was right on the river front.  Both Kamikaze and Rolly Polly had their dogs.  They wouldn't let us sit on the patio but down on the grass by the river.  We didn't mind one bit!  We ate fried green tomatoes, trout dip, salmon cake, and vegetables for dinner.   Stealth came over and gave us a half of bottle of wine that his group couldn't finish.  Kamikaze and I gladly finished it off.  
We headed back to the hostel to find Amazonian, Francis, Feathers, and Spider at the hostel.  They had left earlier in the day on the trail but were back.  Apparently they ran into a creeper on the Virginia Creeper trail about 4 miles out of Damascus.  The man they met said he was a triple crowner and that his name was Raven.  It took him a while to give his name as if he was going though an internal rolodex of names.  His name was Raven because at 11 years old he did his first thru hike with a pet raven that perched on his hiking stick.  The other strange thing is that he knew Feathers' name without even meeting her before.  He must of found it from her YouTube channel.  Raven would fallow them closely and stop when they stopped.  He couldn't judge distance and kept rolling his ankles on roots.  It didn't seem that his story lined up.  The group got to an access road and hitched back to Damascus.  They said that Raven disappeared into the woods.  I hope we don't run into him tomorrow.
Tonight I'm cowboy camping again under the stars.  Theo is at guard between Scissors and Kamikaze on the lawn.  He's going to be like that all night on the lookout for Raven.","Damascus Virginia

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590872,"I woke up on the lawn with my sleeping bag a little wet from the dew on the lawn.  I put it up on the hammock platform to dry out.  The hostel crew made another batch of blueberry waffle pancakes.  I was only able to eat one plate this time though.  Amazonian and Francis were getting ready to head out again.  Francis blew out the front of his shoes with only 300 miles on them.  They were going to stop by the outfitters in town to get some new ones.  Chuckles woke up with a serious stomach ache and felt awful.  Out here we always think it's noravirus, but I think this was something else.  He ended up staying in the town over in a hotel to recover. Scissors, Kamikaze, and I packed our packs and headed out.  We said goodbye to Chuck and Glen the two people running the hostel.
We walked though town and caught up with Amazonian and Francis at the outfitters.  Chuck offered them a ride back to where they got off the trail.  Scissors, Kamikaze, and I stopped at Mojo's for a coffee pick up.  From there we walked out of town.
Usually the climb out of town is the worst but today it was a lot better.  I had shaved down some winter weight and was now hiking in chacos.  The chacos allowed my feet to keep cool and the thick sole helped my feet with fatigue.  The new challenge is to not stub my toes on roots and rocks.  The air was already hot by 9:30 am.  It was only getting hotter and was supposed to be 89 today.  Luckily there were more water sources than rolling into Damascus.  By noon, I was pouring in sweat.  We talked about getting up earlier to hike when it's cool, however, we always sleep in.  I know when it hits full summer, I'll need to start waking up really early to beat the heat.  Kamikaze and I ate lunch a little before the first shelter.  The heat really didn't help me put down my tuna n tortilla. I kept thinking of rotting fish.  
We hiked another 4 miles to a camp spot near the river.  On the way we ran into Spider, Stealth, and Feathers hanging out at a natural beach in the river.  Spider and Feathers had been hanging out there since 11:30 am and it was 5:30 now.  The spot was open to sunlight and had a large group of yellow butterflies that stayed in the area.  Feathers put out a super cube and 20 butterflies descended to them.  She had some really close shots.  Scissors and I decided we'd come back to this spot to swim.  We caught up with Kamikaze at the bridge and told her about the beach.  We setup camp then headed back for a swim.  The water was a little cold but felt great after that sweltering hike.  I was able to perch on a slanted rock on the other side of the river while butterflies flew all around me.  Theo played fetch in the river for an hour like a kid with limitless energy.  Everytime he came out of the river he made sure to shake off on us then roll in sand and shake off some more.  He made shure that we all stayed just as wet and sandy as him.  I cooked my dinner of mashed potatoes and tuna on the beach.  We hung out until hiker midnight then walked back in the dark to our tents.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590892,"This morning I woke up early to sounds of the river.  The weather was cool and not to muggy from the day before.  I put my tent together and ate an oatmeal packet that Theresa made me.  It was super filling.  Scissors and Kamikaze woke up a little later.  Around 9 am, I heard Pumpkin Spice's voice from the bridge.  The crew had camped about a half mile back.  Theo was super excited to see him.  He jumped on Pumpkin Spice and wined with joy.  Poncho, Bandito, Chill, and Pumpkin Spice headed out.  I stretched and waited for Kamikaze and Scissors.  
The trail fallowed the river for sometime.  After about two miles, I arrived at a shelter.  A couple of section hikers informed me that there was aggressive bear activity at the place we were planning to camp tonight.  They had managed to pull down 5 food bags by snapping branches.  The trees in the area are only 15 feet tall and the branches are pretty short.  I hiked out from there and found Scissors and Kamikaze taking a break.  I told them about the bear situation.  We decided to camp two miles from that area in deep gap. 
In another mile was the climb of the day.  It was a 2000 foot climb over 3 miles. It wasn't tough at the beginning but after an hour ascent I needed a break.  Spider passed me but I found him near the bald waiting for Feathers.  He setup his rain fly to wait for her because it sounded like it was going to rain.  You could hear thunder in the distance.  Scissors and I pushed on over the bald. We had lunch on some rocks and watched the rain come in.  It wasn't the best sitting place since we saw lightning then a sudden boom after it.  It was really close and we were exposed on rocks.  I rushed back down there trail to the tree line.  A guy going south bound wanted to talk to me in the middle of the field.  I just flew past him since I didn't want to get hit by lightning. This section of the trail was covered with little white flowers all over the place.  Bumble bees were buzzing away as thunder pounded in the distance.  
We pushed onto deep gap.  The rain picked up but it wasn't pouring yet.  We made it to the site.  It had great bear bag trees and lots of flat area.  I made camp and ate a tasty meal of pasta with powdered cheese.  I made sure not to eat too much candy before hiker midnight.  That didn't do too well with me last time.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590895,"Scissors and I woke up to rain hitting our tent.  It made me not want to get out in it.  Luckily our bear bags were not harmed since we camped over a mile from the shelter.  I put away my tent then ate oatmeal in the rain.  Scissors packed up and we headed for Thomas Knob Shelter. 
It was a smooth climb to the shelter.  When we arrived Pumpkin Spice, Bandito, Chill, and Poncho were there.  They mentioned that a bear was trying to break into the bear locker all night long.  It even tipped over the locker and tried to dig under it.  There was also the remains of a bear bag with empty food packages all over the ground.  The owner just left the mess there without packing it out.  We made a plan to get back to Damascus by getting a ride from Troutdale.   It was only 19 miles down the trail.  Chill had a friend who was going to drive us to Damascus.
Scissors and I headed to Grayson highlands.  When we got to the border we were greeted by ponies. There were adults and babies.  They liked licking the salt from our legs and hands.  I was happy that their tongues were warm since the rain was cold.  I even hugged one but he didn't really like it.  It seemed a lot of them were hiding because of the rain.  We kept moving on.  They were many large rocks and boulders on the trail.  It was slow going since they were wet and slippery.  The landscape was different from any other part of the trail so far.  There were large fields of green grass dotted with bolders.  Large rock faces jutted out of the ground.  It was what I would imagine Ireland or Scotland to be like.
Scissors was craving coffee and we heard that there was a general store in the state park.  We saw a few hikers and asked them for a ride.  Seawolf, Sticks, and Rock gave us a ride to the county store. They had thru hiked the previous year and were having a reunion for trail days.  The country store was an excellent break from the rain.  We had our fill it of Keurig coffee and ate lunch while it was dry.  They waited for us to finish our food then gave us a ride back to the trailhead.  I hope to see them at trail days.
Scissors and I headed back out on the trail.  We saw Remedy hobbling southbound. Apparently he had hurt his ankle and was going to get a ride into town to rest some more.  He said that Kamikaze was a little bit up the trail.  We were excited to see her and Theo.  As we were walking the trail we saw Theo footprints in the mud and knew we were close.  We came to a shelter and someone mentioned they saw Theo but not Kamikaze.  We eventually caught up with them about a mile further.  Theo was happy to see us and made sure to visit each one of us.  We headed another mile and took a break when the rain stopped.  We laid out or socks and tents to dry.  It ended up looking like a yard sale in the middle of the woods.  I took off my socks to let my feet dry.  I cut off about a pound of skin from wet calises on my feet.  Amazonian and Francis showed up.  Francis had been bitten by a spider last night and his leg was swollen.  They are going to go to the next town and seek a clinic.  We moved on and came to another field with clouds lowly hanging in the sky.  Kamikaze and Scissors stopped at a field to camp for the night.  It was peaceful and had a real bathroom, I couldn't blame them.  I was trying to catch up with Pumpkin Spice, Chill, Bandito, and Poncho to make to Damascus for trail days.  I pushed forward to the next shelter.  When I arrived a fire had already been going.  They were all hanging out in the shelter.  It was getting late and I needed to setup my tent.
I camped in a secluded field in the forest with Amazonian and Francis.  They told me their bear bag was attacked last night at the shelter.  They had a ursack made of kevlar that they hung.  The bear had smashed everything inside and had punctured the bag but couldn't tear it.  He popped all the hot chocolate mix inside.  He probably got a high every time one popped and kept trying to get into the bag.  The bag had several holes and bear saliva all over it.  To make sure no bears were getting their food, Amazonian threw a 30 foot high bear hang. She didn't have enough paracod to hang the bag.  I ended up tying my paracod to hers and we shared the line.  It was the highest hang I've done on the trail.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591523,"The meadow was a peaceful place last night.  I heard Amazonian and Francis get up early to make some miles.  Our food was safe from the bears last night.  I wrote in my journal then packed up.  I met everyone else by the shelter.  I put together the 2 stop shop for breakfast which is oatmeal and coffee together.  We were going to hike 10 miles today to Dickey's Gap and get a ride to Damascus from Chill's friend.   While we were getting ready, Foghat, a section hiker showed up and told us about trail magic.  It was only a mile and a half from the shelter!  
We hiked down the mountain and sure enough there was a tent with a grill setup.  Duck fart, Rabbit, and Bisquick were making omelettes for all the thru hikers.  They said they didn't buy forks because they knew thru hikers would have spoons or forks.  Day hikers wouldn't have utensils to eat with.  I also have l had a PBR and orange fanta.  We hung out there for an hour.  Amazonian and Francis were going to get a ride from them back to Damascus.  Francis needed to go to the clinic to have someone look at his leg.
From trail magic we hiked another hour then had lunch.  We had meals every hour.  I think my hiker hunger has been kicking in.  After lunch my stomach hurt a bit then I quickly dug a cathole.  It was diarrhea, maybe the omelette didn't sit well with my stomach since I've been eating awful food most of time.  We set off again and about a mile away I saw Bandito's pack on the side of the trail.  I knew to keep my eyes on the trail.  Apparently, she needed to make a quick stop as well and didn't even have time to dig a cathole.  It was diarrhea magic.  
We came to a waterfall and hung out for a bit enjoying the cool water.   In about another mile we were at Dickey's gap.   Chill's friend wasn't going to show up for another hour and a half.  We had some time to kill.  Pumpkin Spice lazily laid by the road with a lays potato chip bag and tried to hitch.  He didn't get any stops. While we were waiting it was starting to rain.  We all crowded under the Dickey gap sign that acted as a shelter. The water went sideways though and my legs got wet but everything else was ok.  Chill's friend Dakota showed up and we were on our way to Damascus.  Dakota worked as a paramedic and had loads of stories about saving people's lives.  We arrived at Damascus and hung out at Mojo's while Dakota drove back to pickup Bandito and Poncho since there wasn't enough room in the car.  Pumpkin Spice made a reservation at an Airbnb about 30 min out of town.  We picked up food from Food City for breakfast and dinner.   Again we had to make two trips.  Chill and I hung out at the grocery store watching the hikers and locals get their food.  We were offered rides a few times but I doubt anyone would take us 30 minutes outside of town.  
Dakota came back and gave us a ride to the Airbnb.  When we arrived Poncho had started making white chicken chili soup.  I tried some and it was really tasty.  We hung out eating cheese and crackers. I learned that Dakota was gay.  Towards the end of the night he talked about all the weird genetalia he saw as a paramedic.  It was pretty ridiculous.  We stayed up until 2 am and I called it a night.

Surprisingly it wasn't too crowded in town.  I thought 20,000 people coming in would be a lot.  The crew stopped at the thrift store to pickup clothes for the hiker parade tomorrow.  The idea is to pick the most ridiculous outfit to wear.  I found a romper that was a little too small but it will do for the parade!  Poncho and Bandito found some early 90s clothes.  White washed jeans and short shirts.  I headed over to the post office to send my winter gear home.  I'll be getting it back before the whites.  
We walked over the the vendor area.  There were vendors for all major hiking brands.  Big Agnes, Hyperlight, Gossomer Gear, Z packs, and all companies in between.  They all had free give aways at certain times.  The raffles included expensive backpacks and tents.  They were really crowded and it was hard to win anything with so many people.  It seemed that waiting for the raffles you missed out on other events going on.  We walked the whole way to tent city.  I only saw the entrance but apparently it went deep into the woods.  Since it had been raining it was all muddy.  Apparently there was a huge party in tent city last night with drum circles, fires, and tramilies coming together.  I was still happy with sleeping in a real bed to let my body rest.
I saw hikers that I hadn't seen in weeks.  I met up with Strider, Rayrock, Fuiji Pump, FiveO, Reggie, and Sparrow.   Some were behind us some were ahead of us.  
We hung out in town until about 8 pm then headed back to our Airbnb.  We ate a large dinner of salad, white chicken chili, and grilled steak.  With our bellies stuffed we sat down and watched Fellowship of the Ring until 1 am.  Bandito, Chuckles, and I made it to the end of the movie.  Everyone else fell asleep early on.

We drove into town to ship our stuff.  I was sending back my winter sleeping bag since I got a new quilt for summer.  Bandito needed to stop by the outfitters to pickup her boots.  We waited for her for awhile even though she drove the car.  She eventually showed up walking.  Chill had the key fob in his pocket and Bandito couldn't start the car.  She had to walk back.  We decided to stay in town instead of going back to cut down on the number of trips.  We headed over to the diner to grab breakfast.  It was slammed from all the hikers in town.  They had simplified their menu and were not taking any special orders.  It took us an hour to be seated.  I ate french toast, scrambled eggs, sausage, and drank a bloody Mary.  It really hit the spot since I was starving.  
We headed over to the vendor area for a bit then to Sundog Outfitters to walk in the hiker parade.  I busted out my romper from the thift store to class it up.  The parking lot was packed with hikers from the current year as well as previous years.  Most men were in drag from the thrift store.  The ladies had crazy outfits as well.  Miss Janet's van was there as well.  She was giving out ties to everyone.  Her van had banners that everyone could sign for the current class year.  I suddenly felt this splash of cold water on my leg except it was blue.  Poncho decided to shot gun her drink and it exploded on me.  It looked like my romper power suit was throbbing with blue veins.  The parade started and we marched down the street.  The locals were ready for us.  They used squirt guns and hoses to soak us dirty hikers.  I saw one kid with a hose and a huge grin on his face as he shot 100s of hikers.  The parade went through downtown and to the park on the other side of the street.  It stopped near the stage and a huge dance party broke out.  Everyone boogied for awhile until they started an auction for items and that killed the fun.  I went to a few raffles after that but felt it really wasn't worth the time for free stuff.  It would have been better to attend some of the other events going on.  
We wondered one over to the brewery for the hiker prom.  Except the prom didn't happen.  They had bands and beer so it was still a good time.  Spineli, Wizard, and Booger Bear showed up.  Spineli and  Wizard wore each other's outfits.  I was surprised that Wizard could fit into Spineli's clothes even though he was a foot higher.  At one point a whole group of men in women's clothing showed up.  It was a scene from mean girls where everyone was bragging on how much they were going to be crowned queen.  I saw Spider and told him he was a true gentleman since he didn't stare at my chest while talking to me.  The night raged on and Chuckles got a bit drunk.  We packed the Chevy Cruz to the brim and headed back to the Airbnb.  We pretended to be on a rollar coaster swerving around turns in the rain.  Chuckles got really sick and had to vomit out the window.  We all headed to bed soon after making a quick pizza for a late night snack.  Chuckles passed out in the bathroom.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591545,"Today I knew that I couldn't sleep in.  Dakota needed to start heading back to South Carolina by noon.  He worked second shift and wanted to get home early to nap.  Since I packed most of my stuff the night before I was pretty much ready to rock n roll.  I slammed a cup of coffee and the breakfast casserole.  The first car load to go was Poncho, Bandito, Remedy, and I.  We needed to drop off Remedy first at Grayson highlands.  It still took us awhile to get there since the mountain roads curved every which direction.  We talked about the lack of diversity on the trail and reasons for it.    Remedy had a clear day to hike Grayson.  The ponies were out frolicking around.  Dakota dropped us off at Dickey's Gap, we said our goodbyes and headed off on the trail.  Dakota was going to pickup Pumpkin Spice and Chill next.
We were packing a lot of weight today.  I was carrying 4 beers. Poncho and Bandito were carrying 6 beers.  We were planning on having a feast at a campsite 6 miles in.  Luckily trail was pretty flat.   We did have a 500 foot climb over 2 miles but that was nothing.  The weather did get a little hot but nothing like the hike out of Damascus.  We arrived at the next shelter for lunch.  It was swarming with mosquitos.  It was the first place since starting that had so many little buggers. I've heard that New York will be the worst for them.  We climbed back up from the shelter for lunch since we couldn't handle all of them.  I had a tortilla with cheese and summer sausage.  It was way better than tuna!
After lunch we headed another 4 miles to a campsite.  It was nestled in the shade of tall pine trees.  A small stream flowed around the site.  It had a fire ring with a small spring shooting up from the ground.  We setup our tents and waited for Chill and Pumpkin Spice.  After about an hour they came walking down the trail. Pumpkin had a small day pack on the front filled with beer and an empty package of hot dogs.  He had eaten them cold on the way in.  I haven't done something like that since I was a kid.  He was also packing Johnsonville brats and hoogies.   We started gathering wood to build a fire.  Most of the wood was wet from the last several days of rain.  I started cracking large logs by using the fulcrum of two trees.   Poncho and Bandito worked on getting the fire started.  It took about an hour of struggling with leaves, paper, pine needles, and blowing to get it started.  Once a fire gets hot enough you can burn wet wood.  We placed 12 beers in the natural spring that kept them cold.  I sharpened a stick using a tiny Swiss army knife.  It took awhile but I got it there.  The brats cooked up fast over the fire.  As grease fell in the flames rose higher.  Mine split open to reveal all the pink bits getting killed by the flame.  I had to make sure it was dead.   I slid the brat off using the hoogie and added cheese that Pumpkin brought.  He has a crazy addiction to cheese and packed out Doritos, Cheetos, and 3 blocks of cheese.   Luckily it hasn't affected his bowels too much.  A woman named Try Try showed up.  She got her name because this is her 3rd thru hike try.  We offered her brats and beer.  She gladly accepted a brat.  Poncho lost both of her brats in the fire.  She scraped off the ash and ate them anyways.  We started making jokes about going number 2 by saying that we had to go to the board meeting. Sometimes the board meeting was delayed other times it was a last minute meeting.  That convo was signaling the end of the night.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591546,"Last night was not to bad for sleep with the bubbling stream nearby.  Pumpkin Spice did snore loudly through the night but the stream provided sound over it.  We packed up.  I ate a breakfast of freeze dried biscuits and gravy.   It was a mountain house meal that I got for free from trail days.   I don't usually buy them since they are 4 times the price of hiker food you can get at the grocery store.  We headed out planning on hiking to Aktins, about 17 miles away.   I looked like it was going to be a hot day.  
I hiked about 2 miles then checked my phone for signal.  I haven't had much from here to Damascus.  Luckily there were full bars from the ridge line.  I gave Theresa a call since I'll be meeting up with her soon to hike together.   As I was talking to her, I could hear thunder in the distance.  A storm was rolling in.  It started raining, then it rained harder.  It kept on raining for the next 5 miles to Partnership shelter.  I decided not to put on my rain jacket since the rain was a reprieve from the heat.  My shirt was soaked though.  
At partnership shelter, it had it all.  It was next to Pat's visitors center with flushing toilets and showers. They even had a courtesy phone to call into town for pizza.  The shelter itself had two stories and was well put together.  Poncho, Bandito, Pumpkin Spice, and Chill decided to catch the shuttle into Marion for Mexican food and a movie.  I wanted to push on to meet up with Scissors and Kamikaze.  They hopped on the shuttle and I stayed behind.  The visitor's center also had a live hellbender.  It's the largest salamander on the east coast.  It looked like it came right out of the dinosaur age.  The visitor center attendant said that it lays under the same rock all day.  At night they become active to eat crawfish and minnows.  He said it was important not to move rocks in streams since that can destroy their home that they use all their lives.   Hellbenders can live up to 30 years!
I hiked out from the visitors center.  Not long after I was greeted with large fields of ferns.  The pattern of ferns make it look like one of those magic eye books.  It seemed to play tricks with the landscape.  In about 7 miles I arrived at the next shelter.  It was jam packed and there wasn't much space for tenting.  I took a small break there since I had another 4.5 miles to Atkins.  In about 2 miles I arrived at the Lindamood One Room school house.  It was used until 1937 and the Baptist Church used it to leave trail magic!   It had coolers of soda and water, resupply meds, toothpaste, hand sanitizer, anti itch cream, chips, and cookies.  I replaced my toothbrush and toothpaste there.  From there it was half woods half field hiking.  The trail became slick mud and tried keep to the grass.  My feet slipped every which way and my ankle didn't like that too much.  I arrived in Atkins around 8:30.  Sadly Burrito Loco was closed on Mondays!   I was able to grab some gas station grub though and bought heet to refuel my alcohol stove.  The two gas stations were right next to the highway. I wasn't going to camp in the area so I pushed on in the dark.  
It was my first time on the trail that night hiked.  The trail was still slick mud and I could hardly see the trail markers.  I came to a sign that said Davis cemetery and decided to go visit.  It was on top of a hill in a large field surrounded by a fence with a large tree in the middle. The gravestones were weathered by the rain and looked eerie at night.  Even though the place was spooky, the field was lit up by thousands of fireflies.   I had forgotten that it was that time of year. Their little butts twinkled in the distance.   From the gravesite I was determined to stop at the next campsite.  I hiked thru a cow pasture trying to avoid the cow patties with what little light I had.  I climbed over a fence then immediately saw a flat pad. It was were I would be camping for the night.  
I had to setup my tent and hang my bear bag in the dark.  It wasn't that much more difficult than doing it during the day.  I made a dinner of couscous and had a Snickers for dessert.  I talked a bit more to Theresa about our plans for meeting up.  I heard strange noises next to the fence I climbed over.  Luckily I didn't see any eyes shining back at me.  I didn't really get to bed until midnight.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592424,"Last night I didn't hear anymore sounds from the field.  It was really quiet sleeping by myself and I didn't have to deal with people snoring.  I ate a poptart for breakfast and watched as hikers climbed over the barbed wire fence.  Most of them struggled to get over it since it was an angled ladder over the barbed wire.  I talked to a few as they hiked by.
I packed up my stuff and headed out. My ankle had been killing me this morning.  After walking for a little bit though the pain subsided into a dull ache.  The trail was still mud but more manageable than yesterday.  I met Bombadil and After party.  They had been hiking huge days and had started mid April.  We arrived at the quarter way mark on the trail.   We still have over 1500 miles to go.   I believe the next few months will be our fast months though.  We pushed on another 3.3 miles to the quarter way inn.  We came to a large field then a road.  The quarter way in was only .3 miles away.  It was a hostel you could easily get stuck at.  They had resupply items and food to buy.   I got a frozen protein pack, chocolate milk, and a fudge sickle.   We lazily hung around for awhile. I washed my really smelly socks in the sink.  They were awful from the last day of rain.  Eventually I moved on and escaped the cozy clutches of the quarter way inn.  
It was just another 4 miles to the next shelter.  My legs started chaffing from all the humidity.  I applied some more body powder and headed on.  The shelter and camping spots were full again.  I hung out for 15 min for a snack then headed down the trail to find a stealth site.  I called Theresa again to make any last minute requests before she flies to Charlotte tomorrow.  I also texted Scissors and Kamikaze and found out that I'm only 8 miles behind them!  They were also with Booger Bear, Spineli, and Wizard!  I might see them all tomorrow!  If they don't do a 22 mile day.
I found a site that was about 2 miles from the shelter.  It was on the ridgeline and had a view of the sunset.  I ate a dinner of rice and chili.  It took me awhile to find a suitable bear hang tree.  I pulled a few branches off trees with my line.  Eventually I found one.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592425,"I woke up to sounds of rain falling off leaves.  It was pretty early but I was determined to get an earlier start than yesterday.  As I was packing up, I saw hikers from the last shelter pass by.  Bombadil and After party stopped for a little bit for a break as well as a few other people.  They talked about the crazy things that went down at trail days.  After about 5 min they headed out again.  I was determined to catch up to Scissors and Kamikaze today.  They were only 8 miles ahead and I figured I could close the gap. My ankle this morning was killing me already.  I wasn't sure if it was the chacos or the amount of miles I had been doing.  I may need to switch back to shoes.
I headed out for the Chestnut Knob shelter about 8 miles away.  Before the shelter was a 2000 foot climb over 5 miles.  At least it wasn't over any less miles.  The climb up had me sweating profusely.  The heat was only rising since there was no more rain.  I ran into a geocache box on the trail.  It was filled with an old shirt and a fake beeper.  The woods opened up to a large clearing that let you see the surrounding mountains.  I met Sleeping Beauty who got his name because he passed out drunk and people stacked things on him.  He didn't wake until a girl rubbed his head.  Someone told him ""Good Morning Sleeping Beauty"" and the name stuck.  I arrived at the shelter and there was a whole crew hanging out. It was on a large grassy bald where you could lounge.  The shelter was built out of large cemented stones.  It had an open view of the valley below.  I put out my tent to dry in the sun and mad a wrap of summer sausage and cheese.  The cheese had started sweating after not being refrigerated for a long time.  It was still safe to eat though.  
After the shelter it was an area known as God's thumbprint.  It was one of the largest  sinkholes in the world.  The trail followed the edge of it.  The guides showed it as being pretty flat but they were wrong. There were still large climbs and descents over rocky terrain for 10 miles.  The hiker named Asshole started swearing about how he shouldn't trust people when they say a section is going to be flat.  About halfway I ran into Scooter whom I hadn't seen since Franklin.  He had a stick n poke which he had been giving tattoos with.  Apparently his first work wasn't that great but had been getting better over the course of the trail.  We headed off for the shelter and in about 4 miles I arrived to an area full of hikers.  It's funny how a lot hikers set the shelter as the goal to hike to.  I didn't see Scissors or Kamikaze there.  I was already at 18 miles and pushed onto Laurel creek falls campsite about 4.5 miles away.  I had been feeling the Virginia blues by missing my tramily.  I was hoping they would be there.  
I rolled into camp around 8:30.  Everyone was in their tents and I couldn't tell who was in camp.  I came to a clearing with a road and a couple people sitting around a car with trail magic.  I noticed Scissors' hat and jacket!  She was walking back to the campsite and noticed me.  She instantly gave me a hug and I also noticed Kamikaze and Booger Bear was there.  The woman giving out trail magic had soda and cosmic brownies!  We all hung out by her car catching up on the last few days since trail days.  It felt great to be with my tramily again.  It soon rolled into hiker midnight.  I fallowed Kamikaze back to her site and she showed me a great place to camp.  I had to do all my chores well past 11 pm.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592427,"Last night was pretty cold near the falls.  The quilt I bought has been leaking down feathers consistently.  My fleece jacket looks like it's been feathered every morning.  I got up and packed my things away.  I joined Booger bear, Scissors, Kamikaze, Spineli, and Wizard for breakfast.  Wizard had been having the same issues with his quilt that he got at trail days.  Eventually both our quilts will be nothing more than empty shells.  I was excited today because I'm seeing Theresa for the first time in two months.  We had a 6 mile hike to the access road to Bland VA.   I followed Scissors down to the access road.  I followed her pace so I could have a conversation with her.  She had been listening to Ram Das' book Be Love Now.  There was a part in the book where he talks mostly about his guru and the lessons he learned.  Scissors wasn't jiving with that part of the book.  I'll need to listen to it so we can have a book club talk about it.  The hike was flat and then followed a  road for a mile.  Road walking is never enjoyable since our feet were never really made to walk on consistent flat surfaces.  We arrived at the brushy mountain outpost.  Booger Bear and his parents were there.  Booga and I didn't know if we'd be at the same spot when his parents came and visited but luck prevailed.  They headed into town with Spineli and Wizard to grab grub.  Kamikaze got a massive ice cream cone at the outpost.  It looked amazing!  Theresa drove in 20 minutes later.  I was really excited to see her.  I was also glad to have caught up with Scissors and Kamikaze so they could meet Theresa.
The first thing we did is get food in Bland, VA.  There wasn't many choices and we settled on Subway.  I got the normal sub with all the veggies.  Kamikaze had been  feeling sick after eating.  She was checking Web MD which told her she had cancer as usual.  She went to lay outside with Theo to feel better.  Booga, Spineli, and Wizard had the same idea about the best food in town.  
Scissors needed to go to the post office to pickup a package from mom.  She also needed to send a letter to Vermont to say she was unemployed so she could get Obamacare.  It didn't really make sense that she had to send a physical letter. That's the government for ya.  We went across the street to the grocery store so Kamikaze and Scissors could resupply.  Theresa and I decided to hike the trail tonight so we could roll out with them.  I pulled our packs out of the trunk and started putting Theresa's pack together.  We threw all our stuff out in Bland’s City Hall front yard.  I got rid of the stuff sacks that housed the sleeping blanket, air mattress, and three person tent.  I packed Theresa’s pack like I packed mine.  I took more of the weight so she didn’t have to carry so much.  We saw Asshole in town and offered him a ride back to the trailhead.  We jammed more packs in the trunk of the car and were back on the road to the trail head.  
At the Brushy Mountain Outpost, Theresa left her car in the parking lot.  The trail from this section followed very closely to the highway.  It had steep hills with slick gravel and was Theresa’s worst nightmare.  Theresa found out that her boots were too small as her toes were hitting the front of her boots on the steep decline.   It only lasted a quarter mile and we came to a campsite with a stream nearby.  Kamikaze was calling it quits for the day and Scissors pushed onto the shelter.  Theresa and I decided to setup or shelter there as well.  I figured at least we were on the trail and could have an early start tomorrow.  We placed our tent in a little nook of rhododendron near the river.  
At the campsite Jake the dog and Kamikaze were hanging out.  They were trying to get the fire to burn more but all the wood was wet from several days of rain.  Theresa and I hung out with them by the fire.  After awhile Theresa started talking with Kamikaze about losing Matt.  They both shared their own experiences with grief and how it can change over time.      They talked about the aspect where other people expect you to eventually get over it.  Even doctors tried to prescribe them antidepressants to handle their grief.  They both wanted to feel that hurt instead of muting it with drugs.  They talked until 11 pm and decided to call it a night.

The climb from the campsite was pretty steep.  It got Theresa's heartbeat going immediately.  I thought back to when Booga and I started the trail at Amicalola falls.  Those steps put us out of breath real quick.  I made sure to hike behind Theresa so I didn't get too far ahead.  Once we climbed up to the ridgeline the trail leveled out.  Theresa and I were pretty hungry since we didn't have breakfast yet.  We made it to the shelter in about an hour and a half.  I fired up the camp stove and made hot water for coffee and oatmeal for Theresa and I.  We needed to fill up our water at the shelter since there wasn't any for the next 7 miles.  The water source was .3 from the shelter.  It took awhile to walk down to it.  I filtered 6 liters of water for Theresa and I to carry.  As I was grabbing water for the last liter, my foot slipped and jammed into a rock.  My big toe was stinging.  I hiked back up to the shelter and took off my socks.  My big toe was covered in blood.  The rock had sliced open the front of my toe.  It wasn't that deep though and I applied an antibiotic ointment and bandaid.  We pushed on from the shelter for the 7 miles with no water.  We were planning on stealth camping in that area.
The trail followed the ridgeline for those 7 miles.  Liz retired from Austin's botanical garden and knew a great deal about plants in the area.  She would point out flowers and leaves that she knew.  Booga and I  just walked by all the greenery without knowing the names of most things.  I showed her the app plant snap where you could take a picture of a plant and it will tell you what it is.  Hiking the trail we saw several stealth sites but kept pushing on.  We eventually came to a gravel road which was further than we expected to go.  It was also mile 600!  Someone had put together a stick sign to commemorate the achievement.  We all got pictures next to the sign  Right after the road we found a site and setup camp.
The site was large enough house our 3 tents.  It also had a small fire ring.  There were a lot of bugs in the area and I decided to build a fire.  Luckily there was a lot of dry kindling around.  I tried using dry leaves for a few minutes but gave up and used Heet to start the fire.  The fire got hot pretty quick.  I added more wood to build up the coals.  I was cracking large logs between the fork of a tree and built a nice little wood pile.  I made Theresa and I dinner using the stove.  It took a little longer since I was cooking for the both of us.  I made taco mac n cheese and pasta cheese sauce.  Theresa found them both good but liked the pasta cheese sauce more.  Booga had also packed out 4 beers for all of us.  We got another picture with us cheersing near the 600th mile marker.  We finished eating dinner after hung out next to the fire until hiker midnight.  I decided to hike .3 miles to an unreliable water source in the dark.  I needed some water to put out the hot coals.  I walked right past the water source but then heard a growl in the forest.  I quickly turned around and headed back. I saw the reflection of water from my headlamp. It was hidden off trail.  I filtered 3 liters of water then headed back to camp.  I put out the coals with the water.  Theresa and I went to bed.  I was happy to share a tent with her and snuggle up.  It had been two months since I slept next to her.

It started raining, but only a little bit at first.  Theresa had been worried about hiking in the rain.  The canopy provided protection from it.   It started raining harder and harder.  Soon it was a full on downpour from the sky.  The canopy could no longer hold that amount of rain and it was transferred to us.   It was the most rain I had seen so far on the trail.  We were not wearing our rain jackets since it was still too hot to hike in them.  We were completely soaked after 10 minutes.  Theresa didn't mind being soaked though.  I'm glad she was kinda enjoying it.  We arrived at the next shelter.   A hiker named Squirrel was hanging out trying to wait out the rain.  His grandpa had given him his trail name before he passed away.  We hung out at the shelter for about 30 minutes.  A few other soaked hikers showed up and took shelter.  The rain was not stopping.  We all started to get cold from not moving and put on our rain jackets for warmth.  Then we pushed on.
The trail became a stream with all the water falling fast from the sky.  Streams beside us merged with other streams and became a river.  There was one stealth site completely surrounded by water.  It had its own moat.  After another mile we arrived at Lickskillet and waited for George to pick us up.  The house at the trail crossing had a huge Confederate flag.  We didn't see the owner though.  George arrived and saved us from the rain.  He gave Theresa and I a drive back to our car at the Brushy Mountain Outpost.  Liz gave me a whole bunch of food and beer that they had left over.   We said our goodbyes, but we'd see them again an soon.
Theresa and I didn't want to camp tonight because it was supposed to rain more.  We opted for a reservation at the Holiday Inn Express instead in Dublin, VA.  Before that we got lunch at Al's on First.  We were still in our hiker garb from hiking in the rain.  Everyone in the establishment was dressed in business casual.  We did get some looks.  I ordered a huge fried chicken salad.  I needed those veggies!  Theresa ordered a fried chicken sandwich.  The portions were huge and luckily American portions are exactly what thru hikers need.  I couldn't eat all my food in one sitting but I knew I would finish it off later.
We checked into the Holiday Inn and had a king sized bed.  We took showers in our room.  It felt great to get the 7 days of grime off my body.  The fact that we had our own shower was luxury from staying in hostels.  We took a nap and just relaxed for a bit.  We found a really cheap movie theater in town showing the new Han Solo movie.  The other choice was Deadpool 2 but Star Wars always trumps other movies for me.  We got 2 tickets, popcorn, candy, and soda for $25.   In Austin it would be twice as much. It reminded me of Highland theater in Akron Ohio.  I enjoyed the movie but thought Rogue One was a better offshoot movie.  
We headed back to the hotel but stopped at Sheetz on the way.  They make made to order sandwiches.  I got a footlong grilled chicken sandwich with bacon and provolone.  It reminded me of when Sheetz opened up near my old high school and we would hang out there most days because there was nothing else around.  Theresa got a soft serve ice cream cone at McDonald's because it was her nightcap.

About 2 1/2 plates worth.  I had to get my monies worth of food.  Theresa ate half as much.  We went back up to our room and packed up.  
I wanted to show Theresa Grayson highlands but the weather looked like it was going to rain.  We opted to do trail magic instead!  At Walmart we bought soda, beer, juice, water, bananas, tangerines, donuts, chips, nutter butters, cosmic brownies, Reece's cups, cheese crackers, and oatmeal.  I looked at the guide and remembered Laurel Creek Falls was a good place to give out food.  That was an area where you didn't have much resupply for 40 miles.  Hikers arriving at he point would be running out of food trying to get to Bland, VA.  Also it had been raining for the last few days.  I figured a nice pick me up would be great in that location.  
We setup our trail magic at Laurel Creek.  There wasn't any hikers for about 30 minutes.  Eventually we saw a hiker named Bob come walking down the trail.  He was so happy to have a beer and snacks.  Theresa was happy to make people's day after the long haul.  Other hikers trickled in one by one or in groups.  We got excited to see another hiker come down the mountain.  Everyone mostly wanted the beer and ran out of that first.  At one point we had about 7 hikers hanging out chowing down on snacks and drinks.  Snail Trainer a hiker from Oxford packed out 2 of the beers and had 2 while hanging out.  A guy from Austria named Halfway came down the hill.  He mentioned that he watched a documentary about the AT. It showed the nice downslopes and trail magic. However, when he started hiking the trail he realized that was not the case. Theresa and I hung out there until 4:30 then packed up when no more hikers were coming down the mountain.  
Booga had told us that Happy Feet was going to have a birthday party in the woods.   It was at the campsite right past Brushy Mountain Outpost.  When we arrived everyone started singing happy birthday to me with a cake lit.  They were doing that for everyone that showed up.  They had a large tarp setup with light, a stream filled with beer, 15 pizzas, cake, chips, and snacks.  Sparrow, Reggie, Amazonian, Francis (now Chumbawomba), Happy Feet, and Giggles were there.   I hadn't seen a most of them since trail days.  Booger Bear showed up and we all sang Happy birthday to him as well.  His parents hung out there for a bit as well. Theresa and I stayed a little bit since we had a reservation for Woods Hole hostel.  
We headed to Woods Hole following the GPS.   That was a mistake.  There was a sign saying end of town maintenance. It took us on a dirt road into the mountains.    We were driving a Nissan Versa and it had trouble with the terrain.  There were large potholes and part of the road was washed away.  The GPS told us to turn on a road that didn't exist. It got worse and we decided to turn around because we would get stuck and had no signal to call for help.  We backtracked about 8 miles to the paved road again and finally had signal.   I called Woods Hole and Neville said that the GPS takes you on the wrong route.  We ended up driving all the way around the mountain to the other side.  The road was paved all the way there until the last mile but it was well maintained. 
Woods Hole is a paradise for hikers.  It's nestled in the mountains and really close to the trail. They have home cooked meals with vegetables right from their garden.   There are many places to sit and hang out while enjoying a rustic view of fields and mountains.  When we arrived everyone was eating a homemade dinner.  Unfortunately, we were too late to partake.  Scissors and Kamikaze were there as well.  They took a zero there since it was raining and didn't feel like hiking.  I totally understood.  Theresa and I had a private safari tent to stay in.   It had a queen sized bed with a front porch and chairs.  We hung out with everyone for a bit.  Theresa met a guy from Michigan who was giving her grief about going to The Ohio State University.  I'll never understand the rivalry between those two colleges.  I went to The University of Akron.  Its college football was not in the big 10.  
We all moved to the common room in the bunkhouse to play cards against humanity.  There I met Rocky who was doing a work for stay at Woods Hole.  He had force opened a pressure cooker the day before and had scalding burns on his stomach, legs, and arms.  His legs had huge open wounds.  He had not seeked medical attention and was just trying to keep them clean.  He was young and naive to not go to a clinic.  At least to have antibiotics if the wounds do get infected.  Doctors who rolled through the area told him to keep them clean, but what they told them was filtered through what Rocky told us.  Scissors being an operation technician thought he should go to a clinic.  Rocky also kept prying into Kamikaze's personal life.  I understood that she didn't want to talk about it especially during a game of cards against humanity.  He was also encroaching on her personal space.  Luckily the game ended pretty soon at 10 pm which was quiet time. Theresa and I headed to our safari tent.  It had started thundering and raining.  
Tonight I'm listening to the rain pounce off the safari tent while snuggling up to my lady.  Sadly this will be the last night with her until I see her in a month in Ohio.","Lickskillet Road

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592434,"I woke up in the safari tent well rested from the night before.   Theresa and I lounged around in the tent until 7:45.  We walked down to the main house to get organic coffee.  Kamikaze was already up with Theo hanging out on the porch.  We hung out on the porch for a little bit then they started having breakfast by doing the greatful circle.  Neville the hostel owner had us all stand in a circle holding hands.   We had to mention our name, where we were from, and something we were grateful for.  I was grateful for family and tramily.  Many others were grateful for coffee. Neville asked for volunteers to help serve breakfast as well as help clean up.  There was text all over the hostel about having good karma.  You even had to do chores while staying there.  We went to the side of the house for breakfast.  There were octagon tables where everyone could sit at and eat breakfast together.  Breakfast consisted of scrambled eggs with greens from the garden, cheesy grits, orange slices, and peach bread.  It was all amazing food.  
We went back to the safari tent to hang out.  Theresa and I showed Kamikaze and Scissors our cozy room last night.  Kamikaze said that Neville scolded Theo when he was running through the garden.  Theo was chasing the other dog that lived there but Neville seemed to single out Theo.  Theo made one yelp because he saw the other dog playing fetch.  Neville was quick to tell Kamikaze to settle Theo down.  We heard that Neville's partner left the hostel sometime ago and she had to run the place by herself.  I'm sure it was stressful running that place especially if all your help was work for stays.  For someone who talked about karma so much I wonder if some will come back to bite her.      Poncho and Bandito showed up.  They wanted to travel with Kamikaze and Scissors again before they had to leave the trail.  They got to meet Theresa too.  Bandito had been having issues with rashes from her socks.  Theresa gave her some sock liners that she used on her hike.  The trail always provides.   I tried to convince Bandito to keep hiking but she said she would run out of money.  Kamikaze, Scissors, Bandito, and Poncho all packed up to move out.  We gave them some leftover food that we had from trail magic.  They headed out around 11, I know that I'll meet up with them again soon.  
Theresa and I headed to Parisburg for lunch.  The town was a ghost town since it was memorial day.  Even the Chinese restaurant was closed.  We headed back to Dublin, VA for Mexican food.  We called the restaurant to make sure they were open.  I got a large beer and a huge burrito.  Theresa got chimichangas.  The food was loaded with calories just what I needed.  After Mexican we headed to Walmart to pick up more beer to leave by the road as trail magic.  We drove another 30 minutes to Lickskillet to drop me back off in the woods.  We put two coolers out at the trailhead with beer, juice, and water.  A few hikers passed through and were really excited to have a beer.  I got dressed in my hiker garb and put together my food bag.  I made sure that I had everything before Theresa left.  As I was getting ready Halfway and Lost and Found walked into the road.  They were waiting for a ride to the Lickskillet hostel.  Eventually someone showed and they offered to clean up our trail magic after we left.  I said my goodbye to Theresa and gave her a long hug.  I was sad to see her go, but I knew that I had to keep pushing on.  
The trail was a complete muddy mess from Lickskillet to Dismal falls.  I gave up trying to walk around the mud puddles and walked straight through them. The mud covered my socks and sandels.  It got under my feet and felt sandy.  The bridges I came to were slippery as well.  I heard a waterfall in the distance and knew I was close to Dismal falls.  There was a random path without a sign that I took to get there.  It was about 8:30 when I arrived at the falls.  The fast flowing water looked eerie at night.  I worried I would fall in as I grabbed water to filter from it.  I setup my tent about one tenth of a mile from the falls.  I had issues finding a good bear hang tree in the dark.  I almost lost my rock bad to a fork in a tree.  It took way too long to hang up.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592442,"Today I woke up a little late from the bear bag hanging adventure last night.  I could hear Dismal falls in the distance.  The burrito I ate yesterday wanted to come out right away.  I hurried to dig a cathole and made it just in time.  I went to retrieve my bear bag and when pulling the paracord over the branch a knot formed around the high branch.  It happened by luck and was definitely stuck.  Pulling as hard as I could to break the branch did not work.  I left the rope there while I made breakfast.  It was future Jason's problem.  I made oatmeal for breakfast with coffee.  Hikers passed by to check out Dismal falls as I hung out.  I packed my pack then went to deal with the paracord in the tree.  Pulling the rope around the another tree I pulled the troubled branch halfway down and cut my losses.  Hopefully 40 feet of cord will be good enough for other bear hangs.  I hung out by Dismal falls catching up on my journal until noon. Snail Trainer appeared to check out the falls.  I made my way back to the trail.
The trail was still a muddy mess all the way to Wapiti shelter 7 miles away.  There were places where the mud was so wide that you had to walk through it feeling the mud suck your feet in.  I gave up on walking around it and just walked through it since I could just wash my feet in streams.  I caught up to lost and found on the trail.  I found out she was from Japan.  We hiked together for about 2 hours talking about Japanese culture, food, anime, and work.  She used to be a product manual editor but wanted to become a nature guide in Japan.  There were many exams she had to take to become one. She also needed to be out in nature for 50 days, but will definitely pass that thru hiking the AT.  We talked about Japanese food like okonomiyaki and sushi.  Also how the Ghibli movies animated food so well that it made you hungry just watching it.  She talked about working long hours in Japan and was worried about finding a job when she gets back.  Age discrimination is a huge thing there where it's easier to get a job if you're under 35.  Lost and found was approaching 40. I hope she can get that nature guide job when she goes back to Japan.  We stopped for a quick break by the shelter.  Lost and found headed out and I wouldn't see her again until the next shelter.  
From Wapiti shelter it was a 1400 foot climb up the mountain.  Luckily the mud mess disappeared but then there wasn't any water until the next shelter 10 miles away.  The climb got my heart rate up but it wasn't as long as other climbs. At the top I was back in low hanging clouds.  The air was wet and dense.  Even though it wasn't raining everything was wet.  This area felt like a rain forest.  In 5 miles, the forest floor vegetation stopped and the ground was charred black from fire.  For 2 miles the area was burned up.  It was only the forest floor though.  The tall trees were fine and only their trunks got blackened.  New vegetation was pushing up in some areas.  It was mostly ferns taking over the area.  There was also a small stream that wasn't on the map.  I refilled my water and pushed on.  I came to the access road for Woods Hole but pushed of on since I stayed there a day earlier.  It continued to be wet everywhere until Docs Knob shelter.  
The shelter itself slept 8 but also had a huge front deck for lounging.  Lost and found was there finishing her dinner.  I managed to find a campsite behind the shelter.  My bear hang was much more successful this time with an easy limb to throw the paracord over.  I made beef stroganoff for dinner and hung out on the deck for a bit.  Snail Trainer said that he hiked the PCT and hadn't seen anything this wet as he saw on the AT.  He mentioned that he hiked in a dry season though.  It quickly got dark and I made my way to the tent.  The fog reflected back the light from my headlamp and I could only see 5 feet ahead.  I got a lost for a minute trying to find my tent.  
Tonight the wind is blowing through the treetops.  The leaves are catching moisture from the air and dropping water onto my tent.  It's damp in my tent but warm.","Dismal Falls

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593087,"Last night several twigs kept falling on my tent.  It woke me up a few times and I thought a tree was falling on me.  The air stayed wet all night long.  I packed up and made breakfast on the shelter's deck.  It was the usual oatmeal and coffee.  Lost and found was waiting for Halfway.  He had slept 5 miles back.  I hung out for awhile and waited with Lost and found.  Eventually Halfway showed up and we hiked together into Parisburg.
It continued to be cloudy and wet on our hike.  All the leaves were shiny from the constant moisture in the air.  We followed each other like lemmings all the way into town.  The last 2 miles was another patch of slick mud.  I fell at least 3 times while trying to keep my balance.  Luckily I caught myself before I fell in the mud.  Lost and found called the Angels rest hostel and found out they could also give me a shuttle to town.  When we arrived at the parking lot, Bob's parents were there giving out trail magic!  I grabbed some pop tarts and other snacks.  When the shuttle arrived Pumpkin Spice, Kamikaze, Chill, Bandito, Two Crows, and Poncho were already in the car!  I had caught up to the group again.  Scissors was still 20 miles ahead.  I was excited to see everyone again.  They were heading to the first shelter.  I was going into town for food and a quick resupply.  On the way to Angel's rest the shuttle driver mentioned that they had a day pass for $7 where I could use the full facilities.  I took him up on the offer.  
Angel's rest was one of the nicer hostels. It had newer facilities and clean bathrooms.  I hung up my tent and pack cover to dry out.  I took a shower and used a pumice stone to scrape off all the dead skin on my feet.  The sink came in handy to wash my hiking clothes since I didn't have time to use the laundry.  I wanted to get back on the trail to catch up to everyone tonight.  After we were clean, Lost and found, Halfway, two other hikers, and I went to the all you can eat Chinese restaurant.  We ate several plates of food.  I tried eating as much as I could but my stomach couldn't stretch big enough and only made it through 3 plates. Lost and found was the smallest person there but managed to put 6 plates down of food.  Another hiker was vegetarian and didn't have many choices but ate 8 little prepackaged packs of ice cream.  After Chinese we went to the food Lion to resupply.  I just needed a few snacks and a dinner for the 70 mile stretch of nothing after Parisburg.  Halfway bought popcicles and shared them with everyone.  The sun came out jusr barely while we were eating them.  
We headed back over to the hostel.  They had setup a large slip n slide outside.  I wanted to join but didn't want to get all soapy again before I headed out.  Another hiker showed up with a trash bag filled with snacks.  He had raided the local Dollar General's dumpster.  There were little Debbie cakes and trail mixed up for grab.  The expiration dates on the food was 5/31 but most food will last well beyond that date.  I packed my pack with the new resupplies and said goodbye to Halfway and Lost and found.  They mentioned they were slack packing tomorrow and that will see them going southbound.  I'm not sure how long it will be before I see them again after that.  I took the hostel shuttle back to the trail and started a 7 mile hike to the next shelter at 6:30 pm.
The first part of the trail followed the highway for a mile.  Semi trucks zoomed by as I walked on the sidewalk.  I could feel the bridge flex as they drove over.  In the distance there was a line cut through the mountains where the new gas pipeline was going. The shuttle driver mentioned there were protests today over its construction.  After the highway, I was back the woods.  I came to Paris cemetery nestled along the trail.  There was a sign stating that 205 people were buried there but half of the people were unknown.  Most of the gravestone faces had been washed away.  I hiked up the mountain and came to a gravel road with a forest ranger in a truck.  He said I looked tired and asked me where I came from.  Then he told me where the trail led off from the road.  I believe that road was the access road to the pipeline construction.  About 100 yards from from the road there was a homemade sign about the protest and it said to follow the pink ribbons on a side trail to it.  It was already late in the day and I didn't want to get sidetracked.  Night fell and I got out my headlamp to night hike.  About 10 minutes in I saw a glowing pair of eyes staring back at me in the distance.  They quickly disappeared but that sent chills through my body.  I was determined to get to the shelter soon.  In another mile l saw a group of eyes next to me which turned out to be a group of deer.  I came to a clearing and knew I was close to the shelter.  At the top of the bald was a group of tents.  I heard ""Uncle Ya"" and I knew I made it back to my group.  It was around 9:30 and some had gone to sleep already.  I was still full from Chinese and didn't eat dinner.  I put up my tent and hung my bear bag in the dark.  In the distance I could see the twinkling of lights from homes.  They were suddenly skewed as a cloud rolled over the mountain.  It was time for bed.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593096,"This morning I felt lazy from the hike yesterday.  People had already started to get ready by 6:30 am.  I was not in that group.  I eventually got up by 7:30 and started the packing ritual.  I deflated my air mattress while laying on it, changed into hiking clothes, stuffed the pack with my sleeping bag and sleeping clothes, threw the remaining things in my pack, then took down the tent.  It usually takes me 30 minutes to do but some days slower or faster depending on my sleep.  For breakfast I went to a rock ledge overlooking the valley below.  I ate oatmeal, coffee, and poptarts for breakfast.  Poncho, Bandito, Chill, Two Crows, and Kamikaze headed out.  I hung around with Pumpkin Spice and we headed out together.  
The trail was mostly a rollar coaster of large ups and downs.  There was also a 10 mile stretch without water that I was not excited about.  2 miles down the path a guy came running down the trail saying that he saw a panther in the woods.  He said it had long legs and a puffy tail.  People have said there haven't been panthers in the area for a long time.  He also mentioned there were forest rangers asking questions about the pipeline protest along the trail.  We noticed that the guy was also pretty high and could have mistaken a bear as a panther.  Usually you'll only see a large cat when it's ready to attack you.  A little further down the trail I ran into Halfway and Lost and found they were making good progress slack packing.   We talked for a little bit then they were on their way.  I hope I ran into them again.  There was another large group of people coming down the trail.  They had been helping out a protestor who had climbed a tree and was holding up construction of the pipeline.  They mentioned that he was living in the tree but it seemed like he was only there since yesterday.  A little further we saw police tape but no tree dweller in sight.  We pushed on then saw a ranger pulling a cart behind him with a huge chainsaw.  Kamikaze asked him what he was doing with it and said he was cutting firewood...  Further down the trail we met a group of Canadians who gave us chocolate.  I gladly accepted free food.  There was an older gentleman who looked like Rambo.  He was in all black and had a black bandana around his forehead.  Maybe he was sneaking through the woods and that really high hiker thought he was a panther.  I'll never know.  
The 10 mile drought stretch was broken by a stream then the pine swamp shelter.  The shelter had been closed to overnight use because trees had been falling in the area.  The gypsy moth had been killing trees in the area causing them to fall at an alarming rate.  I ate lunch there and listened for any cracking noises.  I made a wrap of spam, cheddar cheese, snack mix, avocado, and a taco Bell hot sauce packet.  Pumpkin Spice had packed out lunch meat.  Something I'll need to consider for future resupplies.  We heard that the ground was headed another 7 miles to a bald to camp for the night.  I wasn't sure about a 20 mile day with all this food weight.  I hiked another 4 miles to the next shelter.  It was mostly mud and uphill.  When I arrived Kamikaze was setting up camp and Pumpkin Spice was eating his dinner.  Pumpkin was going to head out after dinner and do those 4 miles to the bald.  I found a slanted site and setup camp.  I didn't want to setup in the dark for the 4th time tonight.  At the shelter we played the card game bullshit and I made a knorr select pasta side for dinner.  Theo snuggled up next to an Australian hiker.  Apparently he could feel the common bound.  Night rolled in and everyone went to bed.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593098,"Last night my feet kept hitting the bottom of the tent because I was on a slant.  It was hard to fall asleep since my body kept sliding.  I got up around 7:30 am and packed up.  I made oatmeal and drank instant coffee for breakfast.  Kamikaze hadn't got up yet she rolled out of her tent around 8:30 am.  She said she was having a rough day with grief and didn't want to get out of her tent.  I understood what she was going through as an outsider to grief and decided to hang out at the shelter until she was ready to hike.  We rolled out around 9:30.  
The first part of the day was a small climb from the shelter to flat part of the trail.  After 4 miles we came to wind rock where the rest of the crew camped the night before.  The tent pads were much nicer than the last shelter but we didn't want to setup in the dark the night before.  We pushed on to War Spur shelter and ate lunch.  I had wrap of summer sausage, cheddar cheese, and peanut butter.  My body has been craving more calories as I do larger miles each day.  I also ate a few Receeses pieces.  Kazi ate in the grass because of all the flies at the picnic table.  The bugs have been getting worse as the weather warms up.  I have my bug net ready in case there is a day with several black flies in my face.  We pushed onto the next shelter for the next break.  My right ankle hasn't been doing too well in the chacos.  I'm going to try a different pair in Daleville but will have my boots sent back as backup.  The chacos really help in Virginia because it has been raining everyday for the last two weeks.  My feet dry out faster than if they were in shoes.  However if my ankle goes then I'll need to stop hiking the AT.  
We stopped at the next shelter and took a break and planned on stopping short of Sarver Hallow shelter because it would be dark before we got there.  Kazi found a campsite about 3 miles away that didn't have any water.  We loaded up on 3 liters of water each.  About 1.5 miles in we came to a large pasture will tall grass.  Kazi was in front.  After about a quarter mile she checked her legs and found 4 ticks crawling up.  I didn't find any on my legs.  I think she got all of them because she was in front.  Luckily Theo takes medicine for ticks and they die when they bite him.  After the pasture we arrived at the campsite.  It had one large flat pad for both of our tents.  I setup my tent then built a fire to keep all the mosquitos away.  The wood in the area was pretty dry and burned well.  I made a dinner of dehydrated enchiladas with rice.  It made a lot of food but I had already been eating more.  After eating I let Theo clean the pot.  He cleaned it out really well.  Night fell and the lightning bugs came out.  The entire pasture was lit up with little twinkles in the distance.  They never twinkled in unison but in a more spattered way.

We hiked about a half mile and came to the largest oak tree on the Appalachian trail.   It was 18 feet around and had massive branches.  I looked like a toothpick next to its trunk.  There was another climb to a ridgeline with slated slate.  It was damp from this morning's rain.  It was difficult to keep my footing as I hiked across.  One minute I was stepping across the next minute my foot was up in the air and I was sliding sideways down the slate.   A bush of briars stopped my fall.  I got a few briars in my hand and scrapes on my arms.  I stopped for 10 minutes to collect my thoughts.  Stopping at the next shelter I ate lunch.  It was another summer sausage, cheese, and peanut butter wrap.  From there it was another climb up to up Brush mountain.  We stopped at the Audie Murphy monument.   He was the most decorated soldier of world war ll.  He died in a plane crash in 1974.  We hiked down from Brush mountain. 
At the gap we found out the rest of our crew had gotten a ride to a farmhouse 3 miles down the road.  The farmhouse was ran by a guy named Ned. He had opened his house to hikers a few weeks ago.  At first he didn't have many people stay there.  Only a couple people here and there.  Over the last week he had more hikers arrive. The farmhouse had been in his family for over 80 years.  It looked like a 2 story log cabin.  Ned offered us a place to camp in the lawn.  I was excited to have a soft piece of grass to put my tent on.  He offered us beer and his partner was making us all dinner.  We saw that our tramily crew was there with Pumpkin Spice, Poncho, Bandito, and Chill.  Theo was especially happy to see everyone.  Chill built a fire while Pumpkin Spice and I tried to discern objects in the sky as it set.  The clouds were a dark orange color and it looked like the sky was on fire.  They served us a spaghetti casserole dinner.  It really hit the spot after an 18 mile day.  Kamikaze and I hung out in the common area with another guy who had been in the military.  He started talking about being in the moment and living with mother nature.  He resonated with Kamikaze and what she was searching for through her grief.  I left the conversation to take a shower.  It felt great to get several days sweat off me.  I hung out by the fire until midnight and started falling asleep in the chair.  I knew it was time.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593101,"Last night I was able to sleep longer after using an ankle brace.  It kept me from moving my ankle in the night causing a sharp pain that usually woke me up.  My tent was wet from the dew on the lawn.  I got up and walked to the kitchen.  Pumpkin Spice had started cooking eggs, bacon, and biscuits for everyone.  I took over the French press and started making coffee.  All 10 of us ate breakfast together like a real family again.  We felt civilized because we were sitting at a table.  A mountain biker who was staying at the house offered us a ride back to the trailhead.  He said he was leaving in about 30 minutes to head back home.  Kazi and I rushed to pack up.  About 15 min in he asked if we were ready but we were not.  He hovered over us as if it would make us go faster.  Kazi said he could leave and we'd get a ride with Ned, but said he was in no rush.  He offered to help us pack up, but we knew how to pack our packs and it would be more of a disservice.  After 30 min we were ready and got a ride back to the trail head.  
Back on the trail we heard that dragon's tooth would be a technical climb.  Kazi was worried about getting Theo down it.  It would be test for him when we get to the whites in New Hampshire.  We had about a 4 mile climb up to the tooth.  It was part ridgeline and part trail.  At the top, Kazi followed the AT down the technical side without seeing the blue blazed trail for the tooth.  She was more worried about getting Theo down safety.  I took the short .1 mile to dragon's tooth.  It was two jagged rocks that shot up from the ground.  Apparently you could climb on them but I didn't know at the time.  I hiked back to the AT from the tooth.  It was steep slanted rock for a half mile.  Some parts even had ladders built into the rock to climb down.  There were also many day hikers coming up and I had to shimmy past them. I finally caught up to Kazi.  Theo apparently handled that area like a mountain goat.  We took a break and I drank my packed out PBR.  Theo looked tired from the strenuous hike today.  We hiked down to the road and started hiking to 4 pines hostel.  Joe the hostel owner drove by and picked us up on his way back.  
The hostel was donation based.  It was on several acres of land with chickens, Ginny hens, and dogs.  The hostel itself was built into a 3 car garage.  It had a large common area with old couches and a makeshift kitchen.  Kazi and I were hankering for an all you can eat place called Homeplace.  They served southern food and it was supposed to be really good.  Scissors told us that we had to go.  We asked Joe for a ride and he said to take his mini van to the place.  I couldn't believe he'd just let me drive his car but he did have a few junkers on the property.  On the way to Homeplace I got lost but Kazi led me back on the right path.  Homeplace was a large farmhouse that was converted into a restaurant.  Kazi was also meeting a news reporter there who had found Kazi's article online.  She met the the reporter in the parking lot.  The lady was perfectly dressed and smelled really nice compared to our hiker trash clothes and BO smell.  I'm glad that she found interest in Kazi's story and would help get the word out about Matt's Purple Bandana.  In the restaurant I saw Two Crows and hung out with him.  He had eaten 4 plates of food and was ordering dessert.  I started my food challenge.  They brought out fried chicken, green beans, mashed potatoes, gravy, coleslaw, roasted apples, biscuits, and roast beef.  Everything was refillable!  I filled my plate and devoured the whole thing in about 2 minutes.  It was all really good.  Kazi finished the interview and loaded up her plate as well.  I got through about 3 plates of food and felt full but not sick full.  Kazi and I were planning on hiking more but after all the food we decided to stay at the hostel.  We convinced Two Crows to come back to the hostel as well.  As we were leaving 3 other hikers needed a ride back to 4 pines.  It was just Kazi and I but now we had a full carload.  On the way back we needed a short resupply at the gas station.  It had what we needed but at a premium.  Another hiker joined the caravan back to the hostel.  
Back at the hostel the rest of the crew showed up.  They got beer and pizza from the gas station.   We sat in the field on adirondack chairs watching the sunset.  I was hungry again and hiker hunger has finally set in.  Theo was happily giving love to everyone when the hostel owner's dog suddenly attacked.  He bit Theo on muzzle, luckily it was only a scratch.  I believe that dog was jealous of all the love Theo got.  I gave Theresa a call to see how she was doing.  It was great talking to her after just seeing last week.  I do miss her out on the trail.  I eventually got tired and tried to go to bed.  All the lights were on and people were being loud in the common area.  Pumpkin Spice made the decree that he'd turn off the lights in 10 minutes.  It was almost 11 pm and way past hiker midnight.  The lights went out and I climbed into my bunk.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593487,"Last night's sleep was pretty hot in the hostel.  I was still able to sleep though.  Being on the top bunk didn't help with going to the bathroom.  I eventually woke up and sat right back down on the couches in the common room.  Pumpkin Spice had leftover pizza for breakfast. He offered me some and I gladly accepted.  However, during the 3rd piece my body said no more.  Maybe it's gotten to used to oatmeal for breakfast.  In the hiker box, I happily found a new Sawyer water bag.   My original one started leaking a few days ago.  We packed up and started loading into Joe's pick up truck.  As Kazi and I were getting in, Joe moved the truck forward 10 feet.  He knew we were trying to get in and we almost fell to the ground.  I had heard that Joe had a temper, this morning was not his day. 
Kazi and hiked out from 4 pines.  It was another 6 miles to Catawba.  The terrain was super easy compared to the crawl up dragon's tooth.  We arrived at the road to Catawba.  HAM and Rolly were there.  I heard about HAM since the beginning of the trail but haven't met him.  Rolly I hadn't seen since Neels Gap about 700 miles ago.       I also saw Scetch's friend and his truck with the cooler in the back.  I asked him if he had any drinks.  He said only beer but I managed to get one.  He was reluctant to give one away.  Kazi managed to yogi one off of him too.  We hung out for a bit drinking beer and eating snacks then headed out on the climb to McAfee knob.  
It was a 4 mile climb up to McAfee.  At the top a rock slab jutted out into the sky.  From there you could see several miles into the valley below.  A few hikers were eating lunch on the knob.  I got pictures of Kazi hanging off the edge of the knob.  She also Simba'ed Theo on the knob!  I walked up to the edge and it didn't seem like the cliff fell that far off into the tree canopy.  With my legs dangling off the edge Kazi got a pic of me.  We hung for an hour eating lunch on the knob.  A guy named Miss Roberts packed out a double cheeseburger for his knob pic.  I wish I packed out one.  I was on my last leg of food and got creative. I created a wrap with crunchy peanut butter, a Snickers bar, cheese it mix, and threw a cherry poptart on top for good measure.  It was eatable and provided a good amount of calories for the rest of the day.  I could have stayed there all day.  The day was perfect after so many cloudy rainy days.  From there you could also see our sleeping destination at tinker cliffs.  The cliffs looked so far away yet it was only 5 miles.  
Kazi and I hiked down from the knob on to the ridge that would take us to tinker cliffs.  The was one water source right at the beginning and we had to carry extra water all 5 miles.  The trail did follow the ridgeline but it wasn't too rocky.  When we arrived at the cliffs we looked for Two Crows since he said he would be camping at tinker.  He was all the way on the other side of the cliffs.  We setup our tents close to the edge.  My tent was 3 feet from the ledge.  I made sure to stake it down.  Luckily I don't sleep walk.  We all hung out and ate dinner.  I got a picture of Kazi and Theo looking off into the sunset.  Kazi said she was thinking of Matt at the time I took the photo.  The sun disappeared over the mountain and the sky turned a dark red.  It was time for bed and the wind is picking up.
Tonight I hope I don't fall off a cliff in my sleep.","4 pines hostel

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593532,"Last night the wind really picked up over tinker cliffs.  It got cold and my sleeping bag didn't really protect me.  I didn't have the rain fly on my tent.  The wind would blow through and I would be freezing.  I put on my rain fly in the dark right next to a cliff.  I made sure to keep a firm grip on the tree next to me so I didn't fall off the edge.  Even with the rain fly on it was still cold.  I may need to increase the warmth of my sleeping bag somehow for even the cold nights in summer.  I woke up early and packed up my tent making sure not to fall off.  Kazi and Two Crows were awake looking over the valley.  I ate poptarts and a Snickers bar for breakfast.  I didn't want to leave such a beautiful spot but we needed to do town business in Daleville.
We hiked down from the cliffs.  In a half mile it came to a junction.  I was falling Kazi and she turned left.  Two Crows was following me as well.  After about 5 minutes I noticed that the blazes were an off yellow.  From a distance they looked white.  Kazi was in front and I tried to get her attention about the blazes but she was blasting music so loud that she couldn't hear me.  We went .7 down a steep slope and Two Crows and I stopped on the stairs.  We heard Kazi in the distance yell fuck!  We had gone the wrong way and had to go back.  It was a steep climb back up to the junction.  I built a log barrcade on the wrong trail.  Scissors had gone down the wrong path yesterday as well as several other hikers before us.  We added a mile and a half to our trek today.  In about a half mile we came to the shelter to get water.  Pumpkin Spice, Poncho, Bandito, and Chill showed up.  They had watched the sunrise from McAfee Knob and had caught up because of our yellow blaze.  It would be the last hike Poncho and Bandito will be doing on the trail this year.  They originally planned on only going to Harper's ferry but fell short by 300 miles.  They were going to road trip to DC with Pumpkin Spice, Chuckles, and Chill to hang out there for a few days.  We headed out from there like a caravan to Daleville.
When we arrived we got drinks at the gas station.  Scissors had a reservation at motel 8 and we walked over.  Two Crows was already there since he hiked ahead of us.  Scissors showed up and it was great to see her after a week.  Across the street the rest of the crew was hanging out at Howard Johnson.  Chuckles was also in town.  He had gotten off the trail from shin splints.  He had a rental and was able to give us a ride to the post office.  I got a new pair of chacos from REI.  They were a different style from my current pair and the soles were harder.  Hopefully that will help out my ankle if not I'll be switching back to boots.  We headed back to the hotel and got ready to head out to dinner at 3 little pigs.  I was starving by the time we got there.  Two Crows, Kazi, and I shared a pitcher of beer and hung out while waiting for everyone else.  I ordered the 1/4 rib and 1/4 chicken combo.  The BBQ wasn't as great as the food I'd had in Texas but when you're starving everything tastes great.  We hung out for a bit. Chuckles mentioned he was going on a road trip before he had to go back to real life.  After dinner I stopped by the outfitters to get new sock liners.  Mine fell apart after only 200 miles on the trail.  Chacos tend to destroy socks. I went to Kroger to grab some beer for tonight.  While I was in the cheese section I felt something on my waist line.  I looked down to find a tick face deep in my waist.  I don't know where I picked it up but it hadn't been in me for 24 hours.  I pulled the tick out with my finger nails right there in the dairy section then crushed it under my foot. Ticks were never meant to attach to humans.  I then headed back to the hotel to hang out.
Kazi, Scissors, Two Crows, and I caught up on some drama on the trail.  Apparently Asshole got kicked out of his tramily.  We don't know what he did though.  We all headed over to Howard Johnson to hang out with Poncho, Bandito, and Chuckles for one last time.  We told stories about how we all originally met and good times that really stuck out on the trail.  It's going to be sad not having them on the trail.  We tried to convince Bandito to stay on but she was going to run out of money.  We all said our goodbyes and headed back to our hotel.  It was already 11 pm and we still needed to do laundry.  I didn't get to bed until 1:30 am.
Tonight I'm in a soft bed and clean for the first time in 7 days.","Tinker Cliffs

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593533,"I had a wonderful rest last night at the motel 8.  Two Crows slept like a dead person next to me.  We woke up around 8:45 am and headed downstairs for breakfast.  Two Crows had gotten up earlier to get an early start.  He was determined to catch Last Spot who was 150 miles ahead.   I ate waffles, yogurt, fruit, and cereal for breakfast.  I said goodbye to Two Crows since I didn't know the next time I'd see him again.  I went up to the room got my pack ready and headed over to Kroger to resupply. I bought 4 days of food.  I'm going to try bagels with black forest ham, cheese, and avocado this time.  The black forest ham was from the presliced section.  It had an expiration date of July 27th and I figured it had enough preservatives to last awhile.  After Kroger I made the trek to the post office to send my old chacos back.  I didn't want to carry them since they weighed almost 4 pounds.  It was difficult getting there since the main road was basically a highway.  Semi trucks zoomed by at full speed and I could feel the air pressure increase as they passed. It was nerve wrecking and I made sure to pay attention to any distracted drivers.  The employee at the post office was really friendly and helped me with finding the right box for my shoes.  In the smaller towns it seems that the postal workers are less stressed than in the big cities like Austin.  Kazi and Scissors messaged me saying they were getting back on the trail and only hiking 12 miles to the second shelter.  It would be an easier day out of town.  
I got back on the trail at 1 pm.  The sun was hot but I figured I'd be climbing up into the mountains again with cooler temps.  The initial trail out of Daleville seemed like a well kept park.  The grass was mowed and there were places to picnic.  It was pretty loud since the trail was by several highways in the area.  The trail crossed the road to Troutdale and the highway noise subsided after that.  The first shelter I arrived at had a rain water collector for potable water.  Surprisingly it was empty even with all the rain.  Hikers in the shelter thought that the valve was left open and the water leaked out.  I pushed on another 5 miles to the next water source.  At the stream I found a battery pack with a solar charger.   I picked it up and brought it with me to the next shelter.  The water source was .3 miles from the next shelter and didn't want to do that hike.  There was a stream about .5 from the shelter and I decided to carry 3 liters to the shelter so I didn't have to do the extra .6 to get water. I have started making my decisions around not doing extra miles on the trail if I don't have to.  Kazi decided not to go to the shelter and just camp near the water source.  It was a better idea since she didn't have to carry 3 liters of water.  She had changed out her shoes to Hokas.  At first they were giving her intense Achilles heel pain, but it subsided after 2 hours.  They had seemed to be working out for her.  I pushed onto the shelter.  
When I arrived, Scissors was making dinner on the picnic table.  There was also a small girl scout troop there.  They originally had 4 girls but 3 dropped out.  One got dehydrated, another broke her foot before the trip started, the friend of the girl with a broken foot was a duo and didn't feel like going.  Stealth and Rebel Yell were also at the campsite.  Another hiker named Charles was there.  He hadn't gotten a trail name yet.  We were all hanging out at the picnic table when Charles rolled and lit up a huge joint in front of the girl scouts.  Charles really didn't realized what he was doing until after the fact.  Scissors wanted to give him the trail name Girl Scout.  He didn't accept it but we're going to write the story in the trail journals until other hikers start calling him that name.  Hiker midnight came and we all headed for our tents.  
Tonight the air is chilling, I hope it doesn't get too cold for my sleeping bag.","Daleville, VA
",Wilson Creek Shelter,"Jun 06, Wed",11.20
Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593535,"Last night I had a hard time sleeping since the air chilled down.  My sleeping bag is rated for 59 degrees for summer.  However, in the mountains the weather can be cooler.  Other nights it's been warm.  I ended up ordering a 45 degree bag from REI as well as a liner that adds warmth.  On cooler nights I can use both together.  On warmer nights I'll just use the liner.   I'll have to wait to Waynesboro before I have them though.  I got up around 8 am.  Surprisingly Scissors was up eating breakfast already.  Sleeping in the shelter had caused her to wake up earlier with the early risers.  I ate 2 high protein oatmeals as well as a bagel with peanut butter.  I've started to eat more calories as my body has been burning more and more.  The only problem is now I need to carry more food weight.  Scissors said she usually rolls out around 10 am but thought she'd get out earlier today.  We ended up talking to Stealth and Rebel Yell until 10:10.  We were planning on hiking to Cross Jennings Creek about 17 miles away.  The trail looked pretty gradual today with a lot of road crossing which meant for more chances for trail magic.  However, it wasn't the weekend yet.  
We were lazy hiking today through each road crossing.  Each crossing had a view to the valley below.  It followed a scenic route that you could take by car.  The trail came to areas with a large number of trees cut down to create a view of the valley.  At one view Stealth, Rebel, Scissors, and I hung out overlooking the valley.  We got on the conversation about seeing or being around death.  Stealth was stationed in Afghanistan and had seen it all the time over there.  They were training the local police force to fight the Taliban.  Sometimes a whole vehicle would get blown up by an anti tank mine.  The base would receive all the wounded and dead.  Stealth helped bring those causalities in.  Scissors had seen it being a surgical tech at hospitals.  They were jobs where you were surrounded by it.  I pointed out that in the states death seems to be something hidden away from society. While in other countries like India death is out in the open.  People parade their dead loved ones through the streets. The bodies are dressed in colorful garb with large marigold wreaths.  At the end of the parade they burn the dead out in the open near a river or holy place.  It's not hidden away.
Scissors found out that there was a campground near Cross Jennings Creek that offered free shuttle rides.  They had a small camp store but also had a kitchen with hamburgers and french fries.  For any hungry hiker, food is a great motivator.   We now had a reason to hike faster since they closed shop at 8 pm.  It had been a lazy day until now.  Scissors pushed hard from that point to make it on time before the place closed.  We came to an access road to a shelter with water that was .2 from the trail.  There is no point in doing extra miles so we skipped it and found a small stream with water afterwards.  It was pretty dirty water but I filtered and treated the water.  I shared my aquamira with Scissors as well.  We pushed onto the real water source about 3 miles away.  When we arrived Stealth and Rebel were already there.  We hung out and had a quick lunch.  I had a bagel sandwich with black forest ham, sharp cheddar, avocado, and mayonnaise.  It was the best sandwich that I had on the trail so far!  It had just the right amount of flavor being not too sweet or salty.  
We pushed another 6 miles to Jennings Creek.  There was a long descent to the creek.  I knew I was going to regret tomorrow with a huge climb out of it. When Scissors and I arrived everyone was there.  Kazi had already taken a dip in the stream and had been hanging out.  We all setup our tents and bear hangs before heading to the campground for burgers.  Scissors called them and came back devastated saying that their kitchen was only open until 7 pm.  It was 6:55 right now.  They never mentioned that over the phone only saying that the camp store closed at 8 pm.  All of us were not going to have it.  Scissors called the place back and asked if we could have 5 burgers to go.  They agreed and sent us a shuttle.  Our spirits were lifted!  The shuttle showed up 15 minutes later.  It zoomed up the mountain road to a campground about 3 miles away.  The camp store was filled with grease smoke from 5 sizzling burgers.  They came out in a stack with a good portion of fries.  We all happily devoured our food.  Kazi slammed her burger in 2 minutes.  Even I couldn't keep up with that eating speed.  We also all bought milkshakes for dessert.  It all hit the spot and our tummies were so happy.  I also picked up a tube of hydrocortisone at the camp store.  I've started to have skin breakouts from poison ivy.  It's everywhere on the trail and I can't avoid it.  Maybe I'll build an immunity to it if I get it so much.  The shop manager gave us a ride back to Cross Jennings Creek and we thanked him for keeping the kitchen open later than usual for 5 starving hikers.  Back at the creek we saw a large fire.  A woman named Pretzel had started it.  We hung out by the fire for a bit talking about the whereabouts of other hikers on the trail.  The fire burned nicely from all the dried wood in the area.  Like clockwork, hiker midnight rolled in and we all got tired.  
Tonight my tent is squashed up next to Scissors tent on a limited pad.  A whipper willow just started making noise and I want to throw a rock at it.  Luckily the river noise almost overrides its nightly mating calls.","Wilson Creek Shelter

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593557,"Last night the river was soothing to listen to.  There were plenty of bugs trying to get into the tent.  I was afraid of letting them all in after I went to the bathroom.   Only a few got in but I forced them back out of the tent.  I woke up late after not sleeping from midnight to 2 am.  Stealth was by the river getting his French press and grider ready.  I pulled down my bag and made high protein oatmeal by the river.  Scissors came down to take a quick dip before she started trekking today.  Stealth shared his French press coffee with me.  It was the best coffee I had on the trail.  We packed up our things and headed off.
We had 4 gradual miles to the first shelter of the day.  I talked to Pretzel for a little bit while getting water.  She had worked for IBM in their software transition department.  I mentioned I worked as a software consultant and could relate to her work.  The Bryant shelter was well architected and had a few floors for sleeping.  Scissors showed up and we hung around for a little while prepping for a 2300 foot climb over 5 miles.  The climb seemed to go on forever like I was in Georgia again.  It just kept going up and up.  On the bright side my ankle was feeling better on the climb.  After about 2 hours I met up with Kazi again.  She had been having a day with her new shoes.  The outfitter had told her that the shoes were not zero drop when they actually were.  It was causing more strain on her calves than usual.  The shoes were also giving her new blisters on her heels and toes.  She mentioned that the outfitter only tried to sell her the most expensive shoes.  These little outfitters are not like REI, once you buy it you're pretty much stuck with it.  We pushed onto the next shelter but didn't stop.  I wanted to have lunch at Black Rock overlook since we hiked up so much.  Black Rock had a good view of the valley below.  I made another bagel, avocado, cheese, and black forest ham sandwich.  The ham had been keeping well.  It's crazy to think of how much preservatives are in it to keep it that way.  Kazi had bagels and peanut butter.  Theo ate a whole summer sausage.  He was one happy pup!  
We pushed on from Black Rock on another 1000 foot climb to Apple Orchard mountain.  At the top was a large Federal Aviation Tower.  It looked like a giant soccer ball on top of the mountain.  When we arrived a group of hikers were hanging out by it.  They were eating pizza and drinking PBR!  A trail angel had brought food up the mountain.  I gladly accepted all extra calories.  The trail angels had a baby with them and were feeding him lots of milk.  After hanging out for a bit we headed off to the shelter.  We passed the guillotine which was a huge rock suspended in mid air my two cliff edges.  It looked as if it could fall at any time.  We arrived at the thunder hill shelter and considered hiking 3 miles more, but the camping spots were beautiful.  There were flowering rhododendron all around.  It looked like a fairy forest.  A small spring bubbled with refreshing water right next to the site. Not to mention it had a bear box which I hadn't seen in a few hundred miles. It was not a place to pass up.  The only thing wrong was that there were tons of nats flying around my head.  They were the biting kind too.  I setup and made dinner of knorr asian sides with spam.  Every 30 seconds I blew the nats away while cooking and eating.   It started thundering and the shelter name thunder hill didn't disappoint.  We hung out in the shelter while it rained. At hiker midnight I made my way back to the tent. The nats had seemed to disappear too.  They knew the rain was coming.  
Tonight I'm listening to thunder on thunder hill while the rain is tapping my tent.","Cross Jennings Creek
",Thunder Hill Shelter,"Jun 08, Fri",14
Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594371,"Thunder Hill did keep me up last night.  The flashes of lightning were like strobe lights going off in my tent.  It then proceeded to downpour.  The little spring next to our tents started making intense bubbling sounds as the rain came in.  I thought my tent might be under a puddle of water as the spring filled up.  It never got that high though.  In the morning the black flies came back with a vengeance.  I was tryings to eat my oatmeal and they were flying all around me. Occasionally they would land and commence the biting.  I can't wait for the north with all the black flies!  We headed out around 9 am, one hour earlier that usual.
The terrain today was going to be mostly downhill into the access road to Glasgow.  I was wasn't looking forward to it because down hurts more than going up.  It was going to be a 10 mile down.  About a mile from Thunder Hill we came to an overlook to the valley below.  It was the first time I saw clouds below us in a valley.  They've usually been above or I've been in them.  We hung out there for 15 minutes just admiring the view.  A trail maintainer who I met yesterday showed up.  He had lived in Akron Ohio for sometime as well.  His wife was originally married to William Foot a trail maintainer in the section.  Foot was instrumental in acquiring funds for building a foot bridge over the James River.  Rebel Yell was planning to jump off that bridge today even though you can get fined.  We headed on another 4 miles.  Some of the areas didn't have switchbacks and did a number on my ankle.  I haven't had knee problems in awhile and attribute that to getting stronger.  We all stopped for lunch.  I made another black forest ham, cheese, and bagel sandwich.  The ham has still been keeping and hasn't made me sick yet.  We then headed another 7 miles downhill to the foot bridge.  It was the longest foot bridge on the AT and was 30 feet above the water.  Rebel Yell found his spot on the bridge, climbed over the railing, took one second to gather his thoughts, then jumped into the James.  He was in the air for a few seconds then penciled into the river.  He was completely fine.  Kazi followed in his path and also jumped in.  Theo went nuts.  He was whining and screaming until Kazi came out of the water.  Theo looked out for everyone in the group.  We walked across the bridge then waited for a hitch to Glasgow.  As we were waiting Santiago rolled up slack packing from the other direction.  I hadn't seen him for awhile and didn't know where he was.  A woman was picking him up and offered Stealth and I a seat.  When I got in she said $5 a head.  The shuttle drivers were making bank since they only had to drive 5 miles on way.  
When we all got to town we stopped at Scotto's for dinner.  The front had several backpacks and we knew we were in the right location. They placed us in the back with all the other stinky hikers. I got a pitcher of beer and a grilled chicken salad as well as a cheese steak sub.  Blaze walked in.  I hadn't seen her in sometime and I thought she was way ahead.  We hung out until 7:15 then Scissors and I headed over to the laundry mat.  I got dressed just in my rain skirt with no top.  We hung out in the parking lot as locals stared at us as they drove by.  When laundry was done we headed over to the hiker shelter in town.  The shelter had a shower, electricity, firewood, and port a potties with toilet paper.  It was luxury.  I took a hot shower.  It felt nice after today's hike.  A large group of us sat out in the field.  Stealth told a story about being haunted by his ex girlfriends grandma.  Her spirit was attached to a catus that they all got.  She would place things perfectly in the center of the room and change the TV station to her favorite Latin music radio.  Stealth's dogs would just stare at the ceiling and bark.  Before she left for good she placed 3 clammy fingers on Stealth's leg and was gone for good.  We hung out until 11 pm then called it a night.  Stealth gave me his leftover calzone from Scotto's which I happily accepted.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594372,"I woke up this morning well rested.  Camping on grass definitely helped with the cushy sleeping area.  I got up and had a lazy start to roll out of Glasgow.  My stomach was feeling a bit queezy from all the Scotto's I had the night before.  We wanted to get breakfast but Scotto's didn't open until 11 and it was the only restaurant in town.  I went to the DG to do a quick resupply.  Everything didn't look appetizing as I perused the aisles. My stomach kept acting up like it didn't want anything.  It started to get hot.  A few of us layed under the fiberglass dinosaur in town to escape the heat.  A guy offered everyone a ride back to the trailhead.  I stayed back and ordered a cold sub sandwich from Scotto's.   From town it wasn't too hard to hitch a ride back to the trail.  I got a ride from Gonzo who had been shuttling hikers all day. 
I made it back in time to watch Theo freaking out.  Rebel Yell had jumped off the bridge again and Theo went nuts.  He's really protective of his people.  I ate my cold sub which was a mistake before a large climb.  It was a hot day too and doing a 3000 foot climb would be rough.  We all got water at the next water source since there wouldn't be any on the climb for the next 8 miles.  We all headed out from there around 1 pm.  About a mile in I gave Theresa a call.  I caught up with all the things going on in Austin.  After the call my stomach started grumbling. Not just a normal grumble, but the type that wants to eject everything.  I started climbing more but it was slow going with my stomach pains.  After another mile I had to go!  It was diarrhea and the start of Scotto's revenge.  My bowls wanted to go every half a mile but I didn't want to stop that often.  It made me feel weak on the climb.  I eventually got to an overlook and took a break.  I watched as a thunderstorm rolled in.  The black clouds rolled over the valley and I could see the rain coming down.  I had to go to the bathroom again up there.  As I was packing up I noticed the glass over my phone's camera had cracked.  It must of hit a rock while I was sitting down.  It didn't seem like the crack affected picture quality but Theresa is going to send back my point and shoot in case it eventually breaks all the way.  I pushed on to punchbowl shelter after that.  There was some descents but not as bad as the climb.  
I eventually rolled in to punchbowl shelter around 8:30 pm.  Everyone was already setup and they had a fire going at the shelter.  I setup my tent next to a small pond in the area.  I ate some oatmeal for dinner since my stomach was still off.  I used the privy at least 3 times and ran out of toilet paper.  It was my first day of 4 days on the trail.  I'll have to back country bidet it from here or borrow someone's toilet paper.  I went back to the shelter to hang out for a little bit.  My headlamp caught the glow of two eyes in the bushes.  Someone got their bright headlamp out and we could clearly see that it was a raccoon.  It scurried away into the forest.  The log book said the coon would eat your food if you were not careful with it.  We were all listening to the frogs croak in the pond.  At one point they all just stopped.  Then one would make a noise and they'd all start up again.  Hiker midnight rolled around and everyone went to bed.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594373,"Last night was a rough one.  Scotto's revenge didn't end until 3 or 4 am. I hardly got sleep.  On the good side, I managed to save Kazi's food bag from the trash panda.  I heard a thud outside my tent around midnight and thought that the coon was making the rounds to the hanging food bags.  With my headlamp I could see his beady eyes in the tree where Kazi's food was hanging.  He had ripped a hole in her bag and started eating the contents.  Her bag was an easy steal because it was so close to the branch.  It looked like he only got into Theo's food.  I took the bag down and hung it in the shelter.   Then tried to go back to bed.  I went to the privy again around 2 am and noticed the coon in other trees that had food bags.  He didn't manage to steal anyone else's food.  In the morning I let Kazi know that I moved her bag.  She taped up the hole and still had enough food for Theo.  I ate more oatmeal for breakfast.  It seemed like my stomach was getting better.  I headed out from there around 9:30 it was going to be a 17 mile day with a large descent followed by another 3000 foot climb.  
First it was a long downhill into valley.  In the valley the trail followed a long reservoir.  I eventually came to a sign saying that freed slaves had a community along the river in the early 1900s.  They grew corn and made cornmeal. You could see old stone walls along river.  I eventually came to the Brown Mountain Creek shelter.  Scissors was getting water but just about to leave for the big climb of the day.  I hung out and ate a bagel with peanut butter. Eventually it was my turn for the 3000 foot climb.  It was not as brutal as yesterday.  My stomach had felt better since yesterday.  I took several breaks though trying to catch my breath.  At the top it opened into a large meadow with deer chomping on some plants.  It stared at me for a second. I thought it was trying to read my mind. The clouds were blowing over the balds which made it that much wetter. The fog was so dense that I couldn't see 10 feet in front of me.  The field rolled back into the woods for a mile then came out to the meadow.  Blaze, Growler, Double Stack, Rebel Yell, Scissors, Stealth, and Kazi were already setup.  They were all in their tents because the area was cloudy and wet.  I pitched my tent near Stealth and Double Stack.  The water in the air gathered on leaves then fell.  It was only raining if you were under a tree.  I made ramen with ham for dinner then curled up in my sleeping bag for the night.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594374,"It was cold last night.  My sleeping bag hasn't been providing enough warmth for the chilly nights in the mountains.  I've been wearing all my layers and stuffing extra things in my sleeping bag for heat.   I  can't wait to get to Waynesboro for my new sleeping bag.  We all got up pretty late since it was wet outside.  I got up at 9 am then made 3 packets of oatmeal.  My spoon had broken the day before and I used the spoon end to eat.  Last night I used it to eat ramen and burned my fingers as I ate.  However it felt good because it was so cold out.  Everyone was having a late day today.  Stealth made me a cup of coffee that was fresh ground.  It was excellent compared to all instant coffee I'd been drinking.  My ankle was really hurting me today.  One day it's completely fine the other day I'm hobbling.  I don't know what sets it off.  I'll still hike 14 miles today.  
The beginning of the trail was a narrow path through the bald.  It wasn't great on my ankle because of the awkward direction.  I was basically hobbling for the first 2 miles until it worked itself out.  It usually slows me down and I can't keep up with everyone.  When my feet are doing fine I can go a lot faster.  While hiking I started feeling the Virginia Blues.  The promise that Virginia was flat was a lie. The current section had three 3000 foot climbs.  I had Scotto's revenge, broke my phone camera, broke my spork, and my chacos are destroying socks. I have missed home and my lady Theresa.  I look forward to getting off the trail for a few days to make my way up to Ohio.  I'll be hanging out with family and seeing my new niece for the first time.  It's bittersweet though since taking those days off will mean I'll need to make up those miles to catch up with my tramily.  I hope they don't go to far ahead. However, I've always met new people when not trying to stay at the same pace.  It will be a whole other adventure.  
I eventually made it to the priest shelter on priest mountain.  The shelter location was in a bowl on the mountain.  A small stream flowed next to the shelter.  This shelter was special because hikers wrote their confessions in the journal.  Most were about surface poops or blue blazing.  Rotten Ronnie had a huge rant trying to prove himself to everyone.  He left a mean message to Scissors in the book.  She left a witty message for him even though he would never see it.  The campsite was majestic like thunder hill.  There were small quartz crystals embedded in the ground.  The whole area was misty and there was green lush grassy areas throughout the area.  I made some knor risotto with ham but couldn't finish it all.  I packed out the food I couldn't eat.  It got late and I called it a night.
Tonight the clouds have rolled into the area creating a mist.  I hear the little stream nearby.  It's soothing to fall asleep to.","Hog Camp Gap

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594887,"It was a little cold last night but not as cold as the meadow.  Dew from the leaves kept falling on my tent.  I planned on leaving early to catch a shuttle to Devil's Backbone brewery at 5 pm. It was going to be a 15 mile day except there was another 3000 foot climb in the way.  I ate a brownie with peanut butter for breakfast.  I was running out of food and didn't have anymore oatmeal.  I headed out around 8:30 am.
From the priest it was a 3000 foot descent into the valley.  Chill had sent a message about a copper head on the trail.  I never saw the message, but I also didn't see the snake.  It seemed that the descent went on forever.  At the beginning there was mostly rocks on the top then it was rocks and mud the rest of the way down.  It seemed to go on for awhile.  A few hikers passed me on the way down.  They were definitely ultralighters with their small packs as they flew down the trail.  I met up with Scissors near the bottom of the priest.  She was in a fowl mood from this section.  I could feel her frustration.  Our moods were lifted as we saw a trail angel giving out food.  Cindy was making sandwiches with ham, prosciutto, turkey, lettuce, tomatoe, and mayo.  She also had fruit, chips, and soda.  I really didn't have anything to eat for lunch.  It was a lifesaver.  She also gave us a list of local trail angels who would give us a ride into Waynesboro.  
We left the gap with better moods then started a 3000 foot climb up to three ridges mountain.  It started out as a easier climb up the mountain.  About 2 miles up we took a break at the shelter.  I ate another brownie with peanut butter.  I met a section hiker named Melody.  She was hiking the AT a month at a time.  Kazi was there taking a break as well.  She drank some crystal light to get hyped for the second half of the climb.  The second part was the worst of all the climbs in this section. It was rocky, steep, and wet.  There was a section where I had to scramble up rocks.  It seemed to take forever to reach the top.  At the false summit I ran into Scissors, Stealth, and Kazi.  I took a break then headed down the mountain to reach reeds gap for the shuttle to devil's backbone brewery.  With the beer and good food in mind, I picked up the pace.  The remaining trail was the easiest all the day.  I ran into Cosmic and she also had the brewery on the brain.  We arrived at Reeds gap and Fish, Silver Bullet, and Mouse King were already there.  We were able to hitch a ride to the brewery instead of waiting for the shuttle.  
When we arrived at devil's backbone brewery.  I was blown away by the size of it.  It was it's own campus with a brewery, distillery, stage area, cafe, green house, and campground.  They let thru hikers camp there for free.  I met Fish at the bar.  He bought me a drink to pay me back for the trail magic I gave him at Laurel Creek Falls a few weeks ago.  I ordered a burger with fries and added bacon, cheese, and avocado.  It was amazing.  The bar also loaned us growlers to fill at half price.  We each got growlers and took them back to camp.  Pantalones had made a huge fire.  We all sat on picnic tables by the fire and drank our growlers.  I only had two more pints because I didn't want to be hung over the next day.  I went to bed around midnight and the conversations went on into the night. 
Tonight I'm listening to everyone drunkenly talk about being in a hiker trash porno as I drift off to sleep.","The Priest Shelter

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594894,"I was in and out of sleep as the party died down from last night.  I had to go to the bathroom a few times but it wasn't that bad.  Some people stayed up until 2 am.  Sunshine, Granny Gear, and another hiker told everyone to be quiet as they were trying to sleep.  Sunshine made a passive aggressive post on Facebook about everyone being rude and immature at the campsite.  Scissors was just talking about making a hiker trash porno and dealing with periods on the trail. The comment thread was fierce as everyone got involved.  It was really entertaining to have Mouse King read all the comments.  It was strange to see them using that medium instead talking face to face about it.  I packed up my things and got breakfast at the Summit Cafe at devil's backbone.  They had a $5 hiker breakfast that included oatmeal, sausage, eggs, toast, potatoes, and coffee.  I couldn't eat all the food they gave me.  After breakfast the brewery shuttled us back to the trail head.  
Today's trek was going to be easier compared to the last few days.  The elevation profile didn't look so bad.  When I got on the trail however it was covered with slick rocks for 5 miles.  We were planning on doing 15 miles today to the shelter that was 5 miles outside of Waynesboro.  I was going pretty slow over the rocks since my chacos kept slipping.  I eventually met up again with Melody.  We stopped at a view on one of the ledges.  There was a ski resort on the other side of the valley about 10 miles away.  I didn't think they would get enough snow in Virginia but apparently they do.  I kept pushing onto the next shelter without taking many breaks.  I wanted to catch up with everyone.  When I arrived at the shelter no one was there.  They had pushed the extra 5 miles into town.  I was considering pushing the extra 5 miles then Silver Bullet and Mouse King showed up.  They had started the trail at noon and blasted all the way to the shelter.  I decided to follow their pace into town.  Melody decided to stay behind at the shelter.  We ended up doing 5 miles in an hour and 40 minutes. We cruzed all the way to the access road.  Scissors and the rest of the crew had already gotten a ride into town.  I used the trail angel list that Cindy gave us and called several numbers but no one answered except Tom.  He drove out and picked us up for free.  He told us that Waynesboro is trying to be the nicest trail town.  We all got dropped off at the quality inn and thanked Tom for the ride.
I ended up sharing a single room with Two Crows.  He had been there since Tuesday trying to recover from an ankle injury.  I totally understand that kind of pain.  I hung out with Scissors, Kazi, Rebel Yell, and Stealth in their room.  They ordered some pizza and I gladly ate 3 giant pieces.  We watched naked and afraid on TV and related some of the challenges to hiking the AT.  I eventually went back to the other room for the night.  I soaked my feet in the bathtub and used a pumice stone to grind down some of the callouses on my feet.   I didn't want them to get too large and crack.   I then got into a shared bed with Two Crows.  You got to save money somehow!

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594900,"I woke up late and got dressed for breakfast.  Two Crows and I stopped by room 130 and basically woke everyone else up.  Theo was really excited to see Two Crows and I.  He jumped from bed to bed whining.  We hobbled down to the lobby and they had biscuits and gravy, eggs, waffles, yogurt, bagels, muffins, donuts, and coffee.  All the hikers had taken over the entire lobby and were quickly devouring large portions of food. After breakfast Two Crows, Chill, and I crammed all our stuff into the room with Scissors, Kazi, Stealth, and Rebel Yell.  There will be 7 of us sharing a room tonight!  After breakfast it was time for town business.
I went to the post office to pick up 3 boxes.  One had my camera, the other with a new sleeping bag and sleep sheet, and one with my boots and snacks.  I wanted to switch back to my boots since the chacos had been hurting my ankle.  The clerk only brought back two boxes.  The box with the boots should have been there since I bounced it from Buena Vista, VA on Monday.  I checked the tracking number apparently it went all the way back to Austin, TX then it was back in the Richmond distribution center.   It had not arrived in Waynesboro yet.  I'll have to bounce it again to the town after the Shenandoahs when it finally arrives in Waynesboro.  I walked over to the laundry mat and cleaned my clothes after several days a grime on them.  I stopped by the DG to resupply on meds and lotion.  I made sure to get some pepto bismol tablets this time.  As I was walking back to the quality inn, I noticed a ice cream cone painting on the back of a building.  It was a homemade custard shop.  I got a chocolate custard cone and it lifted my spirits after the post office debacle.  
Back at the quality inn everyone was lounging around getting ready to hang out by the pool.  I layed down on the bed and instantly took a nap.  I guess I was that tired.  Eventually I joined everyone at the pool.  Stealth and Cosmic were working on a banner on her tyvek ground sheet that said ""Honk if you love hikers!"".  They draped it over the railing.  We saw one car slow down honk then almost rear end another car.  After that we didn't get anymore honks.  Stealth said ""If no one honks then I will!"" and let out a huge fart.  Blaze managed to get that all on video.  We hung around the pool until dinner time.  Most people were planning on going to Ming's the all you can eat Chinese buffet.  My stomach wasn't feeling that food.  Chill and Two Crows went yesterday and both their stomachs were in agony.  Chill, Two Crows, and I went to Green Leaf.  It was more of a farm to table place.  There was a musician playing an old Gibson guitar. Two Crows was really excited to see that guitar because he had one that was similar.  The guitar itself didn't have a serial number since those ones were made during war times and they cut a lot of corners when building them.  I got a sirloin steak with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Chill and Two Crows mentioned the food here was way better than Ming's.  My stomach hasn't been able to hold as much food right now.   I'm not sure if it was from Scotto's revenge or something else.  I was able to eat most of my food except for all the green beans.  I usually could eat all that food and was sad to see some food taken away.   Hopefully I'll be able to eat large amounts of food soon.  Back at the room I inflated my air mattress and placed it between the two queen beds.  I had made my nest.  Scissors and Stealth wanted to go to the fair.  I was too tired to even go from eating all the food.  I used the time to update my blog and try to pass out early.  They all came back an hour later from the fair. Scissors had won a stuffed alien.  We stayed up chatting and hanging out for awhile.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594920,"We all woke up around 8:30 and got out of bed to gorge on breakfast.  The lobby was really crowded with non thru hikers.  It seemed that everyone was in a mad dash for food.  Alicia sent me a message saying she would be at the inn around 11 am.  I finished packing my bag and noticed my trekking poles were missing. I looked all over the room, checked with everyone, and checked the front desk about a lost and found.  They had completely disappeared.  Alicia showed up I was excited to see her.  She helped me check the other building for the poles but they were lost to the hiking gods.  Everyone else headed for the trail around noon.  I would be headed there around 6 or 7 tonight.  
Alicia first took me to the outfitter so I could buy new trekking poles and socks. I wasn't too excited to have to buy new ones but I did need some for the the trek.  Alicia then took me to downtown Waynesboro.  She had wheels which made it much easier to get around.  We checked out an art gallery downtown that allowed us to view artist working spaces.  It was interesting to see how each artist setup their space.  We then went to basic city brewing and tried a flight of beers.  They were also roasting a whole pig out back but I couldn't put down that much food.  I caught up with Alicia about life in Richmond.  We ate perogies and buffalo cauliflower.  It was so good.  The beer was excellent too.  We learned about the brewery passport where you can get a stamp at 6 breweries in the area and earn a t-shirt.  We were sold on it. We headed to Staunton to check out Shenandoah valley brewing and Queen City brewing.  Both had decent beers to try from.  Alicia's friends showed up at Queen City.  They had a pitbull that was saved from the streets in Mexico.  Her name was Dulce because she was so sweet.  She was really interested in the brewing equipment at Queen City.  Alicia and I headed over to Chicano Boy for tacos.  I was happy that she could drive me around.  The tacos were pretty tasty but not as good as the ones in Austin.  I've been spoiled too much by tex mex tacos.
Alicia then took me to Walmart to grab food for my resupply.  I grabbed a good amount of junk food.  Alicia wanted to see what I'd be packing for the next few days.  She helped me break down my food and pack it.  I really appreciated that.  We then drove back to Rockfish Gap where she dropped me off to get back on the trail.  I thanked her for all the rides and she headed back to Richmond.  I walked back into the woods then came to a sign that allowed me to self register for the Shenandoahs.  Luckily they don't charge hikers for the back country permit.  I hiked for about 2 hours then came to a radio tower.  There were two girls who day hiked to the top.  They offered me wine and I gladly accepted it.  They were interested in what the daily life of a thru hiker is like.  I gave them the run down.  One of the girls mentioned she studied abroad in Japan and we talked about their customs.  Night eventually fell and we left the towers for the woods.  They showed me a stealth spot right after the towers. I thanked them for the wine and company then they were on their way.  I setup my tent and bear hang in the dark then called it a night.
Tonight I'm sleeping in the middle of the woods with no one around.  Hopefully I don't hear a bear tonight.","Waynesboro

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594921,"I woke up early but then snoozed in until 8 am.  I ate some poptarts and cheese crackers for breakfast.  As I was packing up a hiker named Tree Hugger stopped by.  It was starting to rain and he wanted to put on his pack cover.  The weather forecast said it wasn't supposed to rain until Thursday though.  He had started on April 16th and had been doing some big miles.  As he was leaving Lost and Found showed up as well. She had just gotten on the trail a few hours ago and was going to the same shelter as I.  She mentioned that Halfway was on the trail as well.  I quickly packed up because of the rain and then headed out.  
The terrain was going to be easy today except I had a lot of food weight.  There was also a stretch without water for 11 miles.  It was mostly rolling hills and there wasn't much elevation gain like the stretch between Glasgow and Waynesboro.  Around 12:30 I took a break to eat lunch.  I made a bagel, turkey, cheese, and avocado sandwich.  I'm going to keep making these sandwiches until I get sick of them.  I gave my Dad a call for Father's day and we caught up on the events going on at the end of the month.  They were getting their house ready to have lots of family over when my sister brings Sofia over for the first time.  I headed back into the woods.  My pack still felt super heavy with all the food and water weight.  I'll have to keep eating until it feels normal again.  I met Spot who has hiked the AT 5 times.  He said he didn't bring much food through the Shenandoahs since there's waysides and camp stores.  He asked me about my chacos since he might consider hiking in a pair.  He had hiked in a pair of Keen sandels through the whites.  
I arrived at the Blackrock hut around 6 pm.  The shelter was already pretty crowded.  There were a few section hikers staying at the shelter as well.  Spot told me about flat spots down the hill.  I was happy to hear that since most of the tenting pads were taken right near the shelter.  As I was setting up, I talked to Spot about how technology has changed on the trail.  He didn't like that people were now on their phones all the time on the trail.  Most of the time they're checking Guthooks to see exactly where they are.  Other times they are talking to people and don't converse at the shelters.  I said most of the world is going that way though.  At least there are a lot of sections on the trail where you don't get reception.  People are forced to interact.  I made Mac n cheese with spam for dinner.  It was difficult to finish the whole thing but I managed somehow.  I hung up my food on a bear pole and called it a night.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594922,"Last night the whipper willow didn't stop.  It seemed to be right above the shelter.  I put my earplugs in to block its sound.  In the morning I packed up and ate my cold soaked oatmeal.  There was a group of Canadians from Ontario eating breakfast as well.  They had the fancy food packets for breakfast, lunch, dinner.  They said weather was too hot compared to where they're from.  I headed out around 8:30 am planned on doing a 20 mile day.  
About a half mile from the shelter I was cruzing along a flat path when I looked to the right I saw a black bear staring right at me.  He was about 30 feet away and just stood there staring for a minute. Then he just slowly walked back into the forest.  It was my first black bear sighting in 884 miles!  In about another mile I ran into Rebel Yell and Stealth.  I thought they were way ahead of me.  They had a bear visit their camp last night.  He was rummaging through the ground looking for something.  Stealth used his metal plate and spoon as noise makers to scare the bear away.  Rebel Yell got a ride back into Waynesboro the night before with some fellow hikers.  One of the hiker's mom put them up for the night in a hotel.  She also paid for their food in town.  He also managed to yogi some pulled pork sandwiches off some visitors in the park.  He had all the trail magic.  
We pushed onto to the first camp store in loft campground.  The Shenandoahs are filled with camp stores and waysides where one can get food.  At the camp store I bought a couple beers and hung out back.  Stealth asked Rebel how he chipped his tooth.  Rebel talked about the time he got into a fist fight with a guy in his local town.  This guy had been stealing from houses and Rebel was able to put him down until the police showed up.  He chipped his tooth somehow during the fight.  From the camp store we hiked another mile to the access point to the wayside.  It was a half mile down a steep trail but we were determined to go.  At the wayside we ordered burgers, fries, and black berry milkshakes.  It really hit the spot.  I became pretty sleepy and took a siesta near a tree outside.  It was a proper one and we didn't really move for two hours.  4 o'clock rolled around and we made our way back.  Stealth was considering taking the easier trail back up to the AT but then he would skip .3 miles of the trail.  At the fork where we needed to decide which way to go Rebel Yell said ""Fuck it"" and we went back up the trail we came down on.  It was a rough steep climb up but at the end we didn't skip the .3 section of the AT.  In 2 miles we took another long break.  Rebel Yell took out his slingshot and we all practiced shooting with it.  After about 30 minutes we were back on the trail.  
We arrived at the pinehut shelter.  It was packed already with hikers.  There were not many flat spots left.  I decided to push on to fight a stealth spot up the trail.  There were none the whole way to the ranger station about 2 miles away.  I ran into Melody and Bob at the gap.  They were going to push on to find a stealth site as well.  On the way we crossed the 900th mile and got a picture.  Bob stopped in a flat section near the summit.  Melody and I pushed onto a view site about another mile away.  It was getting dark and we eventually had pull out our headlamps.  When we arrived we could see another hiker's headlamp.  He said he was chasing a black bear away from his camp.  He went to look out at the view and when he came back a bear was about 20 feet away from his camp.  He banged on his metal pan and  scared him away.  Melody and I pitched our camp at the site.  I made a bagel sandwich for dinner while trying to swat away June bugs from my face.  They kept trying to fly into our head lamps every 15 seconds.  After dinner we all hung out on the rock ledge overlooking the valley below.  The sky was clear and we could see a decent amount of stars even with the moon up.  I saw a shooting star burn up over the horizon.  It was worth the extra push to make it here.

I made it a mile up the trail then ran into Stealth and Rebel Yell again.  They pointed into the woods and I noticed a momma bear and her two cubs.  The cubs were really playful around her.  They seemed take delight in just climbing a tree or sniffing around the ground.  One cub climbed a tree and just stared at us.  The trio slowly walked into the woods.  Stealth and Rebel Yell pushed on but I couldn't keep up and lost them.  I made it to the high top shelter and filled my water bottles.  I hung out there for about 45 minutes eating my snacks.  I headed out again for the next shelter about 12 miles away.  The terrain was not too difficult but my legs didn't want to move that fast.  It seemed that I was going in slow motion today.  I pushed another 3 miles then gave Theresa a call.  She was having a rough day.  I talked to her for awhile and she started to feel better.  I pushed on the remaining 9 miles but didn't make it to the shelter but the Lewis campground instead.  I didn't want to push to the shelter because it was probably going to be full with no tenting spots left.  
Flex and Curly Turtle shared their campsite with me.  I was greatful to not have to cram into the shelter.  They were an older couple who were thru hiking the AT.  We talked about people's paces and the wayside coming up.  I can't wait for more food.  Flex and Curly Turtle called it a night and went to their tent.  I went to the restroom and took a shower from the sink.  It felt good to just get that slime off me from today's adventure.

It was a fancy place in the park. I headed out at 8 am.  My first goal was the wayside about 8 miles away.
The trail as gradual and smooth today with not many climbs.  I met a day hiker with his dog.  He asked me about thru hiking and took an interest in my hiking sandals.  I asked him for directions for the wayside.  He said it was about 1.5 miles ahead. I took his word then pushed on.   We passed a cemetery on the way then I saw a sign for Lewis falls.  Thinking none of it I hiked to the campground.   When I walked around I asked a woman about directions to the wayside.  She pointed me to an RV just down the road. I walked up to the RV and saw Kayne and Zippy.  They told me the bad news. We passed the turn off for the wayside.  It was now a mile downhill.  The RV owners Betty and Dick offered us beer and I happily accepted.  They had a general interest in thru hikers and had not given out trail magic before.  Betty started making food for everyone.  Dick was driving to the wayside to pickup more beer.  I grabbed a ride from him since I needed to buy a few resupplies.  As I was leaving the wayside, Stealth spotted me.  He was hanging out in the field drinking boxed wine.  I asked him if he wanted to jump in on this trail magic and definitely did.  Dick gave a ride for Stealth and I back to the campsite.  We all happily chowed down on hot dogs, pulled pork sliders, salad, chips, and cookies.  They fed us really well.  It started to rain hard and we all took shelter under the rain fly of the RV.  Rivers started to form near the RV's tires.  They offered us shelter in their RVs as the rain poured down.  A few other hikers came down the trail and Betty being an entertainer offered them beer and shelter as well.  Stealth and I hung out until we were the last ones left. We said our goodbyes to our hosts and headed down the trail.  
Stealth got a message from Rebel Yell who was hanging out at the taproom at the lodge.  Stealth and I decided to backtrack to the lodge to get beer with Rebel Yell.  We cut through the campsite and made our way to the lodge.  Solo and Goonie were with Rebel when we arrived.  I ordered a few IPAs and wings with a salad.  We talked about how we were probably the smelliest people in the room. Stealth went to check on renting a room for the night.  He had made friends with all the hotel workers upstairs.  We pulled the trigger and got a room for the night.  We had only hiked 8 miles today as well.  Stealth was told that the cabin had two beds but when we opened the cabin we only found one bed. The bed was a twin too.  We were going to get super cozy tonight.  Stealth, Rebel Yell, and I walked to the camp store in the rain to get more beer for the night.  We didn't want to spend taproom prices on beer.  No one wanted to give us a hitch to the store about a mile away.  We got soaked but it really didn't matter.  We picked up some beer, wine, and snacks.  I also got black berry ice cream.  It was so good.  Rebel smooth talked a middle aged woman to give us a ride back.  We rocked out to Janis Joplin on the way back and thanked her for the ride.  We chilled in the cabin for a bit then Stealth and Rebel went to the taproom to bum some smokes.  They ran into a park ranger they knew and he bought them a round of drinks.  On the way back to the cabin they saw a whole bunch of screech owls hanging out near the dumpster.  They invited me outside but I was way too tired to move.  I ate a whole bunch of snacks in bed like a bum.

The trail was rocky today.  I followed Rebel Yell for about 8 miles.  We had the Skyland restaurant on the brain and were pushing for it.  They served lunch from 12:30 to 2:30 and we wanted to make sure we made it.  We got stopped a few times on the trail by day hikers who were really interested in what we were doing.  A family from Wisconsin was thinking about thru hiking even though some of their kids were not into it.  We met another guy who had a German Shepherd that was only 7 months old.  She was a really friendly dog.  Nature called for Rebel and I hiked on to the Skyland restaurant.  I got a table for two and ordered a hamburger with sweet potato fries.  It has felt like Disney Land in the Shenandoahs with so many food places to eat at all the time.  As well as places to stay.  Melody showed up and joined me at my table.  She told me she was a special Ed teacher and she loved her job.  Most of her students will move on to live independently when they graduate.  They just need the support to get there.  I saw Rebel just as he was leaving.  He was seated on the other side of the dining room.  We thought they would want to place the smelliest hikers next to each other.  Rebel bought $30 worth of food. He'll need to start to cut back on spending soon so he doesn't run out of money.  I hung out at Skyland until 5 pm.  I was updating my journal online while enjoying my chai latte.  I got back on the trail late and still wanted to go 11 miles.
It started to get cloudy and then drizzle as I hiked.  Eventually it poured rain and didn't stop.  My hiking clothes were soaked but at that point it doesn't matter about being dry anymore.  The trail turned into a stream as water rushed down the mountain.  The mud wasn't that bad.  I eventually saw the first shelter and peered in.  Melody, Rebel Yell, and another hiker were already there. Rebel and I were not going to do our 20 miles today with this rain.  I was sogging wet and didn't want to push to the next shelter with the chance of it being full.  I made ramen for dinner.  Melody shared some of her tea with Rebel and I.  I was glad to have warm food after being soaked and cold.  Melody read us some poetry that I enjoyed and we listened to the rain tap the shelter's roof.  I hung up my food bag and changed into dry clothes and got cozy in my sleeping bag.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595554,"I woke up last night to my finger in pain.  I turned on my headlamp to find it bleeding.  Apparently a mouse thought my finger was food and bit it.  Luckily it wasn't that deep.  A few hours later we woke up to a grunting noise.  It sounded like a bear right outside the shelter.  When we turned on our headlamps it was actually a huge buck eating plants.  We went back to bed.  In the morning it was still raining and the weather forecast said it wasn't stopping.  I slowly got up and started packing up.  I ate a poptart for breakfast.  I didn't want to put my wet clothes back on but I did anyways.  It was so cold that I put my fleece on under my rain jacket.  When leaving the shelter a huge gust of wind hit me.  It was freezing.
The trail was a combination of slick rocks and mud.  It continued to rain without stop.  Parts of the trail turned into small streams that seem to stretch for a quarter mile.  There were no views either since the clouds were dense.  My shining light was another wayside about 11 miles away.  I pushed on as I could feel my feet turn to mush as they got soaked.  Around 2 pm we rolled into the elk wallow wayside.  Rebel Yell was there eating a chili dog.  At the wayside I bought a grilled chicken sandwich and fries and hung outside with Rebel.  A few people stopped by and asked about how our thru hike was going.  Some had even considered doing it but either had to many responsibilities or debt.  About 30 minutes later Melody showed up and also got food at the wayside.  She said she had been thinking about cheese fries for the last two hours.  I think I've gotten to the point where food is my main motivator.  After lunch we all headed out.  We were aiming for the shelter about 7 miles away but Rebel and I were planning on getting as close to Front Royal as possible.  
I pushed onto the next shelter to find that it was full and most of the tenting places were taken. I filled my water bottle knowing that I would be stealth camping somewhere between this shelter and the Tom Floyd shelter.  I got my water and continued on.  The rain hadn't stopped either.  At the next gap a woman in her car got my attention and asked if I wanted trail magic.  I couldn't turn her down even though it was 6:30 and would be dark soon.  She fed me chocolate milk, chocolate muffins, cheez it's, and pop tarts. I chugged a Gatorade as well.  She was slack packing her son Bo who had started May 6th.  He had been averaging 30 mile days.  I couldn't think of doing consistent 30s but he was on a deadline for school in August.   I thanked her for the food and headed out.  The sky started to darken and the trail was still a mud mess.  I kept hiking without a headlamp as far as I could.  Around 9 pm I had to use it.  The rain was coming down harder and the light from the headlamp could only show 10 feet ahead of me.  I kept my eyes on the white blazes to make sure I didn't get lost.  The trail kept getting worse with more mud and water.  I came to Compton gap and it took me 10 minutes to find the continuation of the trail.  It was an old fire access road that was barely marked with white blazes.  I was walking along and my foot suddenly sunk up to my knee cap in water and mud.  I thought my sandals were going to come off in it.  It seemed that I also lost the blazes but after another quarter mile I finally saw one.  I passed sign that said I was leaving the Shenandoahs park.  Finally!  After the sign jagged steep wet rocks appeared on the trail.  It was the park's way of kicking me out.  After another mile I came to the Tom Floyd Wayside.  It wasn't a wayside but a leaky shelter.  I saw that Rebel Yell and another hiker were sleeping in there already.  The hiker made some room for me on a non dripped spot.  I didn't want to make dinner since it was almost 11 pm.  I had done Rebel's birthday challenge were you hike your age in miles.  We had done 28 today.  I ate a Snickers bar, got into dry clothes, then curled into my sleeping bag.  It was a long 13 hour hike day and I felt it.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595556,"I woke up around 7 am but kept sleeping until 8.  Rebel woke up and got ready.  Apparently his sleeping bag got wet yesterday and he slept in his wet clothes.  He was still in a good mood because of the miles we did yesterday and today was his  birthday!   We only had 3 miles to go to the access road to Front Royal.  I got up and ate a poptart and cheese it's for breakfast.  The hike was pretty easy.  There was an area where I had to ford a river.  I just blasted through since my socks were already wet from the day before.  I got to 522 and there was a shuttle already there.  She was an older woman who had just dropped off some hikers.  She told me no charge since she had to go back to Front Royal anyways.  We passed a Smithsonian Institute research building.  She mentioned that they had an open house every November that showed what they were working on.  They did a lot of research on endangered species in the area.  It seemed like an event to go back for.  We rolled into Front Royal and she dropped me off at the post office.  
I saw Rebel coming out of the post office and I made plans to get lunch with him.  I picked up my general delivery package that had been bounced several times.  The box looked like it was run over but the contents were mostly intact.  It had my boots and lots of food.  I grabbed all the food and shipped my boots to Harper's ferry since I wanted to keep rolling in the chacos.  I met Rebel at the gas station and got a message from Kazi and Scissors that they were going to the post office and Walmart.  They had stayed at an Airbnb right next to the trail.  The woman driving them around was the owner and she reluctantly gave us a ride.  We all resupplied at Walmart.  I didn't have to buy much since I had lots of food from my resupply.  The hostel owner dropped us off at the quality inn.   Kazi and Scissors were going to hike 5 miles today.  Rebel got a room but we had to wait until 3 pm to check it.   Next door was a Thai restaurant that we were craving.  I got Kao Soi chicken and Rebel got pad Thai.  That food really hit the spot. I got a text from Kazi and Scissors saying that they didn't want to head out today because they were in a funk from the Airbnb they stayed at.  We offered them the room at the quality inn which was $80 split between 5 people.  Apparently the owners at the Airbnb had treated them like kids and were patronizing them.  The one didn't like Theo dirtying the floor even though several other hikers were staying there.  The owner told Kazi to get on her ""hands and knees"" to clean up the dirt.  It was a depressing experience.  We all got the room and their moods lifted.   We just hung out in the room for awhile drinking beer, watching the world cup, and doing our laundry. 
Rebel and Scissors saw a nice log rolling hill from across the street and decided to roll down it.  Theo was with us and went crazy when they rolled down.  I think he wanted to join them.   Afterwards we went to C&C ice cream.  I got lemon cookie and brownie batter ice cream.  We all headed over to the square with ice cream in hand.  Theo was getting all riled up.  He hadn't hiked today.  A group of children came over and gave Theo pets.  He was getting extra love today.  Rebel, Lit, and I went to the local brewery.  It was more like a gastropub with the prices to fit.  It took a long time to get our appetizers.  Rebel and I wanted to get second dinner but the brewery was keeping that from happening.  Luckily the food came out at 9 pm.  We devoured it then headed over to Pave mint for BBQ.  It was close to closing time but we were still able to order.  We struck up a conversation with a family next to us who were interested in thru hiking.  They asked us all sorts of questions.  We asked the woman how she knew we were thru hikers.  She said we looked ""athletic.""  Our spirits with lifted with that comment and we came to find out that they paid for our first round of drinks!   We had levelled up in the art of yogiing.  I ate a french dip with brisket and Rebel got a cubano.  We were stuffed.  We hobbled back to the hotel room. It was still early but Rebel was done for today.  I gave Theresa a call to catch up with her.  She had been missing me more lately.  I'm really excited to see her soon in Ohio.  I talked until 12:30 am then headed off to bed.  Rebel was taking up the whole bed and I had to push him over to make room for me.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595558,"I woke up to Theo jumping on me and giving me love.  It's the best way to wake up.  We all stumbled down to the lobby around 8:40 to eat the quality inn's continental breakfast.  It was legit with eggs and bacon.  It was also in the same room as the Thai restaurant.  After breakfast we lounged in the room until check out.  The room had looked like a tornado went through it.   With mud all over the floor and in the bathtub.  We walked down to the street to hitch a ride back to the trail. With 5 of us trying to hitch it was hard to get a ride.  Eventually a truck with hay bales in the back gave us a ride.  We jumped in the back and zoomed to the trail head.  We thanked our drivers and got back on the trail.
The plan today was for a 15 mile hike.  It didn't seem that difficult.  I should have known something was up when I saw the wooden pallets on the trail saving us from the mud mess below.   My socks were clean from the day before but I felt they wouldn't stay that way for long.  At one point I was tiptoeing my way around the mud and water on the trail.   The mud spots seemed to go on forever.  I was inching along when my foot slipped right into the liquid mud.  After that I said fuck it and just stormed through the mud.  I was tired of trying to hike around the mud.  My socks had reverted to the day before.  Virginia is not going out easy.  I can't wait to be out of the wettest state on the trail.  I arrived at the first shelter to find Kazi, Scissors, and Lit taking a lunch break.  Thunder clouds had started dumping rain and I was lucky to have a roof over my head.  It poured for a good hour and didn't let up.  It slowly lightened and I used the shelter's shower to clean out the mud in my socks.  The mud, rocks, and sand make it abrasive on my feet.  Cleaning them out helps with less friction.
I headed back on the trail.  It wasn't long before my socks were muddy again.  I wasn't getting away from it.  After about 3 miles I saw Rebel and Lit hanging out at a picnic table with a woman named Summer Camp.  She had thru hiked the previous year and was giving out food!  I gladly accepted all the snacks and drinks.  She had hot dogs, chips, chocolate, hummus, carrots, broccoli, and cheese.  I ate it all!  We talked about her adventures on the trail since she has seen the whole thing.  Rebel asked her if there was anything she would change about the trail.  She said she would change the fact that the AT is a second class citizen in the whites in New Hampshire.  They don't even list the trail as the AT there.  You can easily get lost if you don't pay attention.  We hung out for about an hour then headed back into the mud.  
There were some climbs the way to the shelter.   Half the trail was a climb and the other half was balancing on sticks to make sure your feet didn't get muddy.  I started listening to the audiobook ""A Stranger in the Woods.""  It was about the hermit who lived for 27 years in the Maine wilderness.  He would sustain himself by stealing food from summer camps and homes.  I imagined him living in these woods as I was hiking thru them.  I'm sure the winters here didn't compare to the harsh ones in Maine.  I eventually arrived Dick's Dome shelter around 8:30 pm.  Everyone was already there eating dinner.   I setup in the shelter and ate mashed potatoes and spam for dinner.  I used the river nearby to wash out my socks again.  Tomorrow the they'll get back to brown.   I had a few blisters on my toes that I needed to pop.  I didn't want to pop them earlier since I was trudging through mud.  I caught up on my journal from the last few days then called it a night.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595560,"I stayed up last night catching up on my journal until 11:30.  As I was getting ready for bed I stubbed my toe that had been regrowing a toenail.  It was super painful and my nail started bleeding.  I bandaged it up and tried to go to bed.  It kept stinging all night.  In the morning I got up around 7 am and ate my cold soaked oatmeal for breakfast.  We will be hiking part of the roller coaster today.  It's 13.5 miles of ups and downs with no break in between.  The crew headed out at 9 am.
The trail was still mud squish for most of the day.  I made sure to keep my socks dry by stepping on logs, rocks, and grass to avoid the puddles.  The weather was pretty fair.  I came to a bench and had a snack on it.  That's when Bo came flying by.  I mentioned that I got some trail magic from his mom.  He said he had to average 24 mile days to finish the trail in time before he goes back to school.  I pushed onto the first shelter at 9 miles for a lunch break. I caught up with Rebel, Lit, and Scissors in a flat field.  I wonder if this is the section that deemed Virginia was flat.  I eventually arrived at the shelter for lunch.  I felt pretty tired from not sleeping well from the night before.  Rebel Yell and Lit said they got sad message from one of their friends.  A hiker named Buckets who got off the trail because of hip problems died in a car crash.  I never met her on the trail but I was saddened by the news.  She was only 19 years old too. They didn't know how it happened but the news has been spreading up and down the trail.  We're like one huge extended family out here.  
From the shelter I saw the sign that said I was entering the roller coaster.  It was then a straight up over rocky terrain to the top of the first mountain.  Then down another rock mess to a valley.  Then straight up again over rocks and stones that seemed to slip under my feet.  It was exhausting.  I felt that the trail was built on purpose this way.  There were hardly any switchbacks.  Virginia needed to go out with a bang.  I started smelling BBQ in the forest.  I thought maybe there was a glamping site nearby.  A day hiker coming southbound said there was trail magic up ahead.  I was excited for the prospect of free food.  I came to an access road and the crew was hanging out in the grass.  I then saw Wokman who I hadn't seen since Franklin, NC.  He was doing trail magic in this section and offered me a little hug and burger.  I gladly accepted the free grub.  I remembered him telling me that he would start Virginia in the middle then flip flop if he thru hiked again.  I was on the same thought on Virginia.  His whole family was with him too.  I stayed for a little bit then pushed on.
About 2 miles in, I heard Rebel Yell screaming and making rebel yells.  I knew that he crossed the 1000 mile marker.  I was excited to see the marker and couldn't believe I hiked 1000 miles.  Lit was playing ""I'm going to be"" by The Proclaimers.  Theo was super excited as well since he could feel the energy of the ground.  We poured out some wine for Buckets then headed on.  It was another two rocky climbs until we got to our campsite.  We all pitched our tents close together and built a fire.  It took awhile to get the fire started from all the wet wood.  I made one of my pasta dinners and shared one with Kazi.  We hung out by the fire until 10 pm then decided to call it a night.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595563,"I woke up a bit slated but rested enough.  I checked our tents to find Rebel Yell's tent gone.  He had left at 4:50 am in the morning.  It was way earlier than I would want to leave in the morning.  I might have to do it eventually with the days getting hotter and hotter.  I got up around 7:30 am and ate my breakfast of cold oatmeal then headed out at 9 am. 
We still had another 4 miles of the roller coaster to finish and after that the elevation profile didn't look so bad.  The remaining 4 miles of the coaster was still the same steep mess of rocks and bolders.  It never felt like I could get a solid footing.  It made my feet work extra hard.  I was hiking together with Scissors when we saw the Virginia / West Virginia state line.  We were elated to have finally left Virginia after so many miles.  Virgina was not an easy state.  It has the longest section of the Appalachian trail.  Hiker's said it was flat which was a lie.  Our minds were tested against pain, rain, sickness, and boredom.  It was a huge milestone to cross that border.  Shortly after the the border the roller coaster ended and the trail flattened out.  Even though it was flat it was still covered with several rocks.  They put my feet and ankles to the test.  After about 5 miles I came to the shelter to eat lunch and grab water.  A hiker was resting in the shelter.  I ate some snacks for lunch then headed about .25 miles to a water source.  It was a rough hike down but there wasn't any water for another 9 miles.  
I left the shelter and hiked on to highway 9.  Kazi and Scissors were taking a break.  My feet were hurting by that point from all the rocks in the area.  As we were hanging out, we saw two men with baskets walk by.  I thought they might be foraging for something.  Kazi left first but she soon returned. Apparently one of the men jumped out of the forest and started running down the trail.  She said they were tweaking and didn't want to hike alone.  Scissors and I hiked with her until we met up with the men again.  They had been out picking chanterelle mushrooms.  One looked like he was constantly itching himself.  They walked back towards their car and we didn't see them again.  As we got closer to Harper's Ferry we started getting strange vibes in the forest.  This place had a lot of history during the civil war and many soldiers died in the area. Stealth sent the following text when he camped near the Manassas shelter:
""It was at the stretch of woods at manassas shelter where the confederate army had a huge base and the energy was really heavy. It's hard to explain... but i had set up my tent in the woods last night and before I went to bed I was talking with my dad about my great great grandfather who was a drummer boy in the civil war for the New Hampshire volunteer army and how when he made it home he was so frail and small that his mom held him like a baby. So that was on my mind as I went to sleep. The moon was really bright and high up in the sky when for some reason at 3:20 am I woke up to what I thought was an animal sprinting out of the woods but turned out to be an enormous heavy energy that swooped out of the woods and began so encompass me in and around my tent to where I couldn't move or speak like sleep paralysis. And for about 4 or 5 terrifying seconds all sides of my tent were being warped and pushed in repeatedly and was on top of me with this heavy weight holding me down. And keep in mind that the moon was so bright I was watching all of this wide awake...So I tried as hard as I could to scream anything at all and all that came out was a forced, closed mouth groan and as soon as I did that whatever energy it was swooped back into the woods like a fucking death eater from Harry Potter. When I packed up my tent this morning the tent stakes were moved from the force of whatever it was pushing on and warping my tent.""
This area was definitely heavy from its past.  Kazi and I hiked over the Shenandoah river then came to the access road to the quality inn.  Kazi waited outside since we had to sneak Theo into the room.  This hotel didn't allow dogs.  The front clerk was missing and there was a sign saying he was helping another customer.  I waited for about 20 minutes but the clerk didn't show.  Scissors hiked in and also waited.  Eventually the clerk came barrelling out of the restroom.  We got our room keys then collapsed on the bed.  We didn't want to go out and ended up ordering Italian food.  Lit showed up an hour later then Rebel Yell an hour after that.  We all gorged on salad, cheese sticks, and chicken parmigiana.  I quickly felt sleepy and went to bed.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595708,"I woke up in the hotel room with everyone still asleep.  I was a bit tired myself but got up to get breakfast at the quality inn.  They had the normal quality inn breakfast with biscuits, sausage, eggs, waffles, pastries, juice, and coffee.  After breakfast we headed out to the ATC to get our psychological halfway pictures.  
At the ATC I got my picture taken near the ATC sign.  I have seen several hikers before me get the same picture in front of this sign.  They printed it out and I filled in the rest of the into on the picture.  I placed in the book with other fellow hikers for the 2018 hiking year.  I messaged my friends Penny and Dave who had hiked in 2014 and asked when they passed through Harper's Ferry.  I found their picture in the ATC records.  The ATC's bathroom was filled with inspirational quotes that made me feel that I could finish the rest of the trail.  After the ATC we got lunch at the Cannon Ball Deli.  I ate a gyro with a salad and chips.  It really hit the spot.   
After lunch we headed to the old fire house where John Brown led a famous revolt to steal firearms.  His plan was to use the weapons to attack plantations in Virginia to free slaves.  John' revolt only lasted 46 hours in the fire house.  General Lee who was still under the Untied States Army ordered troops to storm the firehouse and arrest them.  John Brown was captured and his men surrendered after that.  He was eventually tried and charged with murder and treason.  He was hung on December 2nd, 1859.  
We explored a few other buildings downtown.  There were college students interning for the summer.  They were dressed up in 1850s clothing and knew a lot about the history of the town.  We were all interested in the ghosts in town.  One student didn't want to talk about ghosts.  We did find another student who did.  He told us that there was a ghost tour in town that regularly ran at 8 pm.  We thought about making our own tour but it would be really hard to go out after 9 pm.  We all headed back to the hotel to rest some more.
Back at the hotel Kazi and I wanted some wine and beer but we didn't want to walk.  We called Anthony who was like an Uber eats driver.  He went to Walmart and face timed Kazi while in the store so we could check out the the selection.  We ended up with 3 liters of wine and a six pack and didn't have to lift a finger to get it.  There was a premium for the service though.  We all hung out in the room eating leftover pasta from the night before and watching movies.  I felt super late lazy but I was giving my feet the rest they needed.  Stealth rolled in a little while later.  He struck up a 2 hour conversation with a local while hiking through town.  Everyone stayed up pretty late while I passed out early.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596534,"It was another breakfast at the quality inn.  It seems all these hotels get the same kind of food.  We didn't mind because we had to eat a lot of calories.  Stealth, Rebel, and I headed back to the ATC.  Stealth needed to get his picture in front of the sign.  I hung out in the hiker lounge and got more ice cream and soda.  We saw Silver Bullet, Tree Beard, and Mouse King there.  Mouse King and Tree Beard were going to do the 4 state challenge which is 44 miles in 24 hours.  Silver Bullet wasn't feeling it and asked if she could stay in our hotel room tonight.  I didn't blame her.  44 miles in one day would destroy my feet.  
I headed out with Stealth to pickup his package drop at the post office.   The post office shared the same building with the police station and a liquor store.  We grabbed his package then headed downtown to check out the historic area.  On the way, there were houses from the early to mid 1800s.  Some had been remodeled while others were rotting away.  Other houses looked really creepy and we wondered how many were haunted.  We passed the John Brown wax museum and decided to check it out.  The museum depicted a timeline of John Brown's life.  It showed how he got his initial hatred of slavery and his exploits to abolish it.  Some scenes were intense as he raided people's houses in Kansas to kill anyone who supported slavery.  The museum depicted scenes from the failed raid on the armory in Harper's Ferry.  The last scene showed him walking up to the gallows.  After the museum we met Rebel Yell at an outside bar downtown.  Someone asked Rebel if he was one of those ""trailers"".  Rebel responded by saying he was trailer trash.  We all laughed.  
We headed back to the hotel and chilled in the room for the rest of the night.  It was going to be my last night with the kaboose crew before I head to Ohio for a week.  I'll be seeing my niece for the first time!  I can't wait!

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596535,"I rented a car from Harper's Ferry and drove home to Ohio. The drive was about 5 hours and it was really easy compared to hiking several miles a day.  I arrived at my parent's house around 9 pm.  My mom greeted me and she was holding Sofia.  It was the first time I had seen her and really happy to finally have met her.  She was born while I was on the trail. I was looking forward to meeting her for two months while hiking through TN, NC, and VA.  She was smiling and looked really content.   A baby's life is pretty easy when the world revolves around them. I unpacked my car and stayed in the guest bedroom.  
On Saturday my sister had a party for Sofia.  Our family and friends came over to our parent's house to meet Sofia for the first time.  She was handled by several people and she took a nap for a few hours.  I couldn't blame her after all that stimulation.  There was tons of food and beer as well.  My family's plan was to fatten me up for when I got back on the trail.  I ate a plate of chicken, sausage, potato salad, and macaroni salad.  I really wanted to eat more but I've become a snacker on the trail.  A few people asked me about the trail.  Most of the questions were about food I ate on the trail and where I went to the bathroom.  At the end of the day I dropped Theresa's parents back at their house in Akron.  I visited my friend Matt at the coffee shop he worked at.  He noticed my mountain man beard.  I had been working on it over the last 3 months.  We caught up a little before he had to close up  shop.  I headed home and passed out fast on a comfy bed. 
Sunday was a pretty lazy day at my parents house.  Sofia was pretty chill as she mostly slept or ate.  Even when she got fussy she looked really cute.  I held her, fed her, and burped her.  Luckily she didn't burp up anything but I've had worse things on me on the trail.  She was eager to drink all the milk.  I felt really happy to be with her and to take care of her.  I'll look forward to finishing the trail so I can see her again.   Theresa showed up in the evening after driving back from Columbus.  She had gone to a wedding over the weekend.  I was really excited to see her since it's been a month.  We caught up on all the things.  It felt great to have her in my arms for the night.  
On Monday Theresa had to go to work.  I headed up to Akron to hang out with my friends Adrianne and Matt.  Matt was moving out of his house and I help him move a few things with my rental car.  The day was already hot by 10 am.  We tried going to La Loma and Nepali kitchen for lunch but both were closed on Mondays.  We settled on Rancheros.  I got a massive burrito but couldn't finish it since my body was still in snacking mode.  We explored the local Indian stores.  They had a grocery store filled with spices and exotic fruits and vegetables.  Another store was filled with colorful Indian clothing.  I never knew these places existed in Akron.  After heading back to my parent's house we visited my grandma at the nursing home.  It was the first time she saw her great granddaughter.  She was excited to see her.  My grandma is 92 and is still going strong.  Afterwards we headed back home and watched some movies.  Theresa came back over and I became really sleepy.  I think my body was trying to recover from all the hiking.  
On Tuesday my sister, Cris, and Sofia headed back to Texas.  I was sad to see them go.  I know I'll see them all soon when I finish the trail.  My parents were also leaving for Seneca lake for the 4th.  Theresa ended up taking a half day and we made our was to Blue door for lunch.  We raced to the restaurant since they closed at 2 pm.  I got chicken and waffles.  The waffles were way better than the Quality Inn.  Theresa got some really tasty french toast.  I was super content with the food.  We then got some ice cream since it felt like 100 degrees outside.  A heat wave had been hitting the east coast.  I'm glad I wasn't hiking in this heat.  At night Matt invited Adrianne, Theresa, and I to the Orrville fair.  I hadn't been to a fair in awhile.  I gorged on all the deep fried things.  I really didn't care about the calories either.  We got on a ride that made you feel like you were flying.  Another ride was a giant loop.  The loop spun us upside down several times.  I could feel the blood rush to my head.  We called it a night pretty early.  Theresa and I stayed at her parent's house in Akron.  I was happy to pass out in a soft bed by her side.  
On the 4th, we grilled hamburgers, hotdogs, and goat at Theresa's parents house.  I was the grill master for the burgers but the neighbor grilled up the goat.  Theresa's cousin Nick showed up with several large boxes of fireworks.  He was planning on having his own display tonight.  Theresa and I headed over to Penny and Dave's.  They had hiked the AT back in 2014.  They gave me some tips on bugs in the north.  We hung out with their kids Frances and Abe.  Abe was such a happy baby.  He seemed to be smiling all the time.  Dave put on some music and we all danced with Frances.  In the backyard Frances played with a sparkler as other neighbors started lighting off fireworks.  West Akron is where you go for home grown firework displays.  It seemed that every other house started shooting off mortars and rockets.  We watched the displays all over.  We said our goodbyes to Penny and Dave then headed back over to Theresa's parents house.  Nick was lighting off huge mortars in the road.  A few of the mortars hit the power line causing them to explore near the ground.  We had to dodge flaming pieces of mortar as they hit the ground.  One mortar went off and hit Theresa's mom in the arm.  Luckily the shell glanced off her body and exploded behind her.  Theresa and I were ready to get out of the war zone.  We headed back to my parent's house to pack up.  I stayed up late getting my pack ready.  Sadly it would be the last night with Theresa until I see her again on the trail. We still need to figure that out.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596536,"Today I woke in bed with Theresa.  It felt great to sleep in a real bed.  I'll be leaving today for the trail.  It's been wonderful to see my family and friends. Especially my new niece Sofia.  The trail calls again and I need to catch up to my tramily.  I got up and packed the rest of my backpack.  Theresa had to head to work and I was sad to see her go.  I hope we can figure out a place to meet when I'm further north.
I started the 5 hour commute back to Harper's Ferry.  It was a short drive back and I would be on the trail today. I stopped at Walmart to resupply and picked up some bagels and peanut butter. I already had a decent amount of food from when I left the trail.  I drove back to Harper's Ferry and returned the rental.  They dropped me off at the ATC building.  In the hiker lounge I ran into Fiji.  I hadn't seen him since trail days in Damascus. He was part of a tramily now.  I got an ice cream and headed back on the trail.
The path leaving Harper's Ferry followed the Potomac river.  It was flat and every 1/8 mile there was a beach.  A few families were walking back to the town as I marched forward.  I was planning on 16 but figured I would fall short.  It was already 5:30 and dusk would be in 3 1/2 hours.  I hiked and night eventually fell.  I rolled through Garthland state park.  It was a civil war battleground and was pretty eerie at night.  Luckily I didn't see any lost soldiers.  After the park the shelter was .3 down a steep road.  I ran into Snorts and her friend who was building a fire.  They pointed me in the direction of the shelter.  A few women had setup their tents in the shelter. I didn't want to deal with bugs while trying to sleep and setup my tent in the shelter.   I know it's taboo to do this but no one else wanted to use the shelter.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596538,"I didn't sleep well last night as the person snoring sounded like a monster in the night.  I wanted to get up early but slept in.  I made oatmeal for breakfast and had some coffee.  I met a southbounder named Firefly.  She was continuing her thru hike from the previous year.  She had to get off the trail from an ankle sprain.  Going south she hadn't seen many people when she got back on this year.  She said the worst thing about Pennsylvania is the not the rocks but the rattlesnakes.  It was the only area were she saw several of them.  I packed up the rest of my stuff then headed out.
The elevation profile was pretty flat today.  I hiked for 7 miles then came to the Dahlgren backpack campground.  This campground had flushing toilets and warm showers.  It was a luxury on the trail.  I ate lunch consisting of a bagel with peanut butter and Pringles.  I took a shower knowing that I would be sweaty in an hour anyways.  Snorts told me about being bluff charged by a bear.  She screamed at it and the bear ran away.  I pushed on from the campground to Washington monument state park.
When I arrived at the park a group of hikers were hanging out on some picnic tables.  I came to find out a majority of them were from Austin Texas.  We talked about breakfast tacos for 5 minutes before we had to stop because we were all getting too hungry.  From there I hiked to the monument which looked like a giant milk jug.  I climbed the steps inside of it and was greeted with a view of the valley below.  The breeze was refreshing from the top.  From the monument the trail went on through people's backyards and over a highway.  It was pretty flat compared to Virginia.  One part had several rocks and did a number on my ankle.  I had been wearing new Ultra shoes and had been getting used to the zero drop.  My calves weren't burning at all but my ankle had been hurting me.  I arrived at the shelter around 9 pm. Snorts was there as well as the rest of her tramily.  I made some chicken with a potato sauce for dinner.  Another hiker packed out a tenderloin and started cooking it over the fire.  It was a massive chunk of meat.  Snorts ate it like an animal.  I grabbed some water, hung my food bag, then setup my tent for the night.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596760,"Today I woke up not so well rested since my ankle was in pain for most of the night.  The 21 mile day did a number on my ankle.    I got up and hobbled on my bad foot while packing up my tent.  I eventually got my tent packed up and headed to the shelter to eat breakfast.  I planned on doing a 20 mile day but I figured I would fall short.  
The trail was pretty flat but with my ankle in costent pain it could have been a 3000 foot climb.  Walking over rocks set my tendons on fire.  I kept thinking my ankle was going to end my thru hike today.  It never seemed to let up and I took several breaks to ease the stress on my foot.  After 10 miles I arrived at Pen Mar park just before the Dixon Mason line.  I took a long lunch to catch up on my journal and to rest my foot.  Several other hikers came through the park.  Some were hitching into Waynesboro for resupply others were ordering pizza to be delivered to the park.   I stayed until 5 pm then headed out.  About a half mile later I arrived at the Dixon Mason line and passed into Pennsylvania.  I was finally in the north!  The log there was filled with many people I recognized.  I hiked another mile and came to a gap with a lunchbox and a box of donuts.  It was trail magic!  There was one beer left in the lunchbox and one donut.  It really made my day after being in a lot of pain.  I felt a wave of joy as I drank the beer and slammed that donut.  I hiked another 4 miles and came to The Deer Lick Shelters.  
At the shelter only one other person was there.  Her name was Galileo and she was from Houston Texas.  I thought she might have been from a smaller town with her accent but she lived in a small town as a kid.  There was already a fire going and I helped gather wood.  Galileo worked in the oil and gas industry.  A typical field in Houston.  Her work gave her a leave of absence to hike the trail.  She got her name from trying to seek out a meter shower on the trail.   She had a huge interest in astronomy.   We also talked about the burning man festival and she mentioned there were several regional burns all over the nation. Apparently there was one in West Virginia that's supposed to be the largest.  It got cold and we moved the picnic table closer to the fire.  I made a pasta and meat sauce for dinner.  We ended up staying up to midnight watching cowboy TV before calling it a night.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596761,"I had a late wake up this morning since I stayed up so late.  Galileo ended up sleeping in as well.  She usually woke up early but this was the latest start she has had on the trail.  That's the power of the caboose crew!  We slow people down to enjoy the moment on the trail.  We hung out eating breakfast until 11 am.  A few other hikers stopped at the shelter to break as well.  Galileo had oversupplied at Waynesboro and had food to share.  I happily took some food off her hands.  She ate pretty healthy with dried veggies and fruit.  She had just started on the trail in June and was wondering how long eating healthy would last.  I headed out and I hope to run into her path again.  
I planned on going into Fayetteville today to resupply but I've been getting more food from hikers.  I decided to skip the resupply and get food tomorrow after I attempt the half gallon ice cream eating challenge.  My ankle had been doing better.  It was more of an ache instead of feeling like a thru hike ender.  I hiked for about 2 miles then ran into Stryx, Hummingbird, Fire Poops, and Bubbles.   Stryx had worked in the wilderness searching for protected owl areas.  She would use an owl call to locate them.  I hung out and stretched my legs to get them ready for the rest of the hike.  Heading out from there the trail went over gas lines and under high tension wires.  There were rocks but not too many.  It's going to be rough when I get further north with the PA rocks.  I eventually arrived at route 30 that went into Fayetteville.  I hiked a half mile with Hummingbird, Fire Poops, and Bubbles to Timbers.  It was a restaurant with an ice cream parlor.  Hummingbird, Fire Poops, and Bubbles ordered double entrees and the food could hardly fit on the table.   I got a double cheeseburger with a milkshake and didn't want to overdue it like Scotto's revenge.   Afterwards everyone was super tired.   I was ok since I didn't eat until almost exploding.   We headed out around 7 pm.  They all stayed at the state park about a half mile down the trail.  I pushed onto the shelter.  
The Quarry Gap Shelters were some of the best shelters I've seen on the trail.  It was well taken care of.   It felt like someone's home.  There were flower baskets hanging up and the area was well landscaped.  The privy was really clean and had an air freshener, purell, and even a light!  I setup my tent in the shelter because I could.  One day someone might make a fuss but I didn't want to get eaten by mosquitos.  Everyone at the shelter was talking about the half gallon ice cream challenge.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596764,"Sleeping in the shelter was pretty peaceful last night.  There were mice scurrying around but none jumped on me nor bit my finger.  I got up and ate a bagel with peanut butter and honey.  Today was the day for the half gallon ice cream challenge.  I was pretty excited to eat all that ice cream and would use it as motivation for my hike.  I got up around 8 am and headed out around 9 am.  
I hiked out with Snorts and Chomps.  Snorts was having issues with her calves locking up and had to stop to stretch them out.  She had also been hiking in Chacos.  I pushed ahead and didn't see them for the rest of the day.  The trail was pretty easy today.  In some areas it was flat for miles.  Southern Pennsylvania has been easy so far except I know the rocks are coming.  I ran into Squirrel and Brian.  I hadn't seen Squirrel since Bland, VA when I was hiking with Theresa.  Squirrel mentioned he hiked 102 miles without stopping through that area.  It took him 3 days and he didn't sleep.  By the end of the trek he started hallucinating.  He mentioned that gorilla duct tape did the trick when his feet got fatigued.  We came to a gap and I saw a truck, coolers, and a grill.  It was trail magic!  I retired couple fed us burgers, hot dogs, chips, soda, moon pies, and fruit.  I was stoked for this meal since all I had was peanut butter and tortillas for lunch.  I ate all the food and was greatful.  It's always a treat to have trail magic during the week.  We headed out from there and eventually came to the actual midway point on the AT.  I was now more than half done.  In another 3 miles, there was another halfway sign except this one was installed in 2011.  It was not the actual halfway point but they would need to move the sign every year since the trail's length always changes.  
After another 4 miles we arrived at the pine grove furnace camp store.  It was the home of the half gallon challenge.  The store invented the challenge to sell ice cream at high prices but I was going to still do it.  Bubbles, Humming Bird, and Fire Breather were already there.  They all just finished their half gallons of ice cream.  Humming Bird wasn't looking so great.  Bubbles was handling it like a champ and was plotting how to beat the time record which was 12 minutes and 30 seconds.  I went into the store and got a half gallon of chocolate ice cream.  I started digging into it.  The ice cream was tough but I was determined to eat all of it.  I was thinking about Theresa since she likes ice cream so much.  About 3/4 of the way into the tub I hit a wall and ate at a slow pace.  I eventually finished it but had to get a cup of ice cream since the tub wasn't an actual half gallon.  I crawled through eating it and finished in 30 minutes.  They gave me a wooden spoon and I entered my name into the log book.  I felt ok after eating that ice cream and thought about if I needed dinner.  We all got pictures of us in an ice cream comatose on the lawn then headed over to the lake.  The park had a beach on a lake.  Humming Bird, Fire Breather, Bubbles, and I went swimming.  It felt great after a 17 mile day.  Luckily no ice cream came back up.  We packed our bags and headed a quarter mile to a stealth site.  It was an island between two streams with hemlocks growing on it.  It was a beautiful site.  We all setup and hung out for a bit.  I didn't eat any dinner since the ice cream still filled my belly.  I setup my tent and turned in for an early night.

I was excited about a deli about 8 miles out.  It was a reason to hike a little faster today for those deli sandwiches.  I tried to convince humming bird and fire eater to go but they were not having it.  The trail had gradual slopes and it was easy to get there.  At the deli I ordered a taco salad and hung outside.  Two women who were section hiking sat next to me.  We got to talking about the different sections in PA.  The one woman ordered too much food and she shared her sandwich with me.  I was happy to get some extra food.  They headed back to the trail and I stayed behind to update my journal.  I got back on the trail at 12:30 pm.
The sun started cooking the forest today.  The humidity was high too.  I made sure to drink extra water.  After a couple miles I came to some high tension wires and a saw a tarp with a quilt on top with a backpack laying beside it.  I didn't see anyone around and it seemed strange for it to be there.  I came to a road crossing and found a man walking down the road.  He was wearing a yellow shirt and had a long beard. He said he was suffering from PTSD.  He said his knife was in the woods and that I shouldn't be worried.  All of a sudden the woman who I met at the deli told me to come into the woods since she called the police on the guy.  He had been making some threatening statements.  The police rolled up and the guy just lost it.  He talked about making pipe bombs and light bulb bombs.  Also how the government had been tracking him for some time.  The police didn't seem too worried and let the guy rant for awhile.  We didn't stick around long enough to see what happened.  I hiked with the woman for 4 miles to make sure we had a safe distance from the guy.  She said she was a 7th grade English teacher as well as an EMT.  We pushed on through the rock maze which was not that fun.  Some places you had to climb over bolders.  I hiked ahead and came to an open cornfield.  It was the start of the Cumberland Valley and was 17 miles of farm fields.  It was 5 pm and super hot in the open field.  I pushed on another 2 miles and arrived in Boiling Springs.  
Boiling Springs was a small town but it looked like it had history with all its houses with character.  I stopped by the outfitters and got more fuel for my stove.  I then went to the tavern for a drink and dinner.  Humming Bird, Fire Breather, and Bubbles were already there having drinks.  We all ordered food.  They got some of their drinks paid for by locals in town.  Fire Breather got all his drinks paid for.  I thought because he had an accent and was from South Africa. We talked to the bartender about camping in town since we didn't want to hike back a half of a mile to the site outside of town.  He mentioned camping in the gazebo in the park since there wasn't many police who went by at night.  We took his word for it then headed out to the gazebo.  It was a very tranquil location with a lake and some ducks.  When nightfall hit we all setup our tents in the gazebo.  It started raining shortly after.  We had to keep from using our headlamps to not give away our position.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596937,"I woke up to ducks quacking in the lake.   No one bothered us during the night in the gazebo.  They should make it a shelter for hikers to use rather than a mile outside of town.  Humming Bird, Fire Breather, Bubbles and I got up around 5:45 am to beat the midday heat in the valley.  We will have 13 miles of corn fields today.  I ate some poptarts and a Snickers for breakfast.  It seems that I'm eating more and more sugar.   Aladdin who I met months ago said by the end all I'll be eating is candy.  Humming Bird dumped out her food bag at she had at least 10 days of food.  She shared some candy with us.  Fire Breather got most of the food, but that's what partners are for.  We hit the trail at 7:15 am.
It was going to be a pretty flat day of hiking.  The elevation profile didn't show much change but that doesn't mean there's no rocks.  We blazed the first 5 miles of the trail except when we stopped to eat wild berries along the trail.  They were like raspberries but a little more sweet.  It seemed every 200 yards we were stopping to eat berries.  You don't get many chances for free food on the trail.   We stopped at a water source to refill.  Fire Breather had a whole in the bottom of his new pack that he got at the outfitter in Harper's Ferry.  He called the outfitter to see if he could return it but the person in charge of returns was at a trade show.  Bubbles needed to go to REI to swap out his pack.  They were deciding on renting a car to do all these errands.  I told them I was going to keep pushing on to Duncannon, PA.  I rolled out and kept pushing on through the flatlands. 
After about 10 miles I came to a sign saying there was trail magic in the parking lot. A man in a pick up truck was giving out drinks and candy. I hung out for a little bit.  He mentioned that there was a hiker feast in Duncannon at the Lutheran Church from 5 to 7.  It was 3:30 then and I still needed to go another 9 miles.  I didn't think I could make it but it was still a push to get me there.  I headed out.  It was still pretty flat but then I hit rocks.  There were rocks for miles and they didn't seem to end.  They slowed me down but I still thought about the hiker feast.  I passed another hiker going south and she asked me if I was going to the hiker feast.  She said that Duncannon was only an hour hike away and it was 5:30.  I had a fighting chance but I know that you can't always trust someone's interpretation of distance and time.  I came to a steep decline that was covered in rocks.  Jumping down from rock to rock really hurt my feet.  It was 6 pm now and the town still looked like it was 2 miles away.  I eventually descended the rock mess and came to a road leading into town.  I was on the edge of town at 6:50 and the church was a 10 minute walk away.  I hoofed it over there.  When I arrived they were still serving spaghetti, salad, bread, and dessert.  I was so excited to have made it in time.  I loaded up on pasta and greens then got to work making it disappear.  Volunteers kept bringing me more and more food.  I had to start declining some because I didn't want to eat too much.  They even had some resupply things like bandages, batteries, toothbrushes, etc.  I loaded up on the resupply stuff as well. I had to rush because I had to check in to The Doyle Hotel at 8 pm.  
The Doyle was known for being the dirtiest hotel on the trail.  It was legendary and I was surprised it hadn't been closed down.  The woman who ran the place told me everything in the reviews was true except for the bed bugs and flying locusts.  I knew what I was getting myself into.  The building itself was a relic and it looked like it was in disrepair.  I got my room key then ascended 3 flights of stairs.  The ceiling had water marks from years of leaking water.  It was also pretty dark inside and it didn't seem that the lights worked.  I got to my room on the fourth floor and peered in.  It was a simple room with a table, chair, dresser, and bed.  The floor looked like it hadn't been cleaned in awhile.  The window had to be propped up with a wooden dowel rod.  The ceiling looked as if it could fall at anytime.  It was home for the night.  I made sure to check the bed for bed bugs and layed down to rest.  I gave Theresa a call to catch up on the week.  I then took a shower.  The bathroom was equally as bad.  It seemed that the floor was going to fall through.  There was a little note that said the importance of closing the shower curtain all the way or it destroys the ceiling of the other bathroom below.  It looked like the toilet hadn't been cleaned in a week.  It was all well worth the $25 for my own room.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597266,"This morning I woke up to the fan blowing cold air in my face in The Doyle.  It stayed pretty cold though the night even without A/C.  No bugs ran across me and it was pretty quiet.  I got up and sorted the food in my pack.  I needed to resupply and do laundry since I didn't want to do anything the night before.  I figured I needed 4 days of food since the next decent town was about 70 miles away.  I packed my bag then headed over to the laundry mat first.  It was great to have clean clothes again.  I then stopped my a restaurant called Goodies for breakfast.  I saw Lupin and her friend who I met at The Doyle the night before.  They mentioned that the post office had a really good hiker box.  I ate a breakfast sandwich and home fries. It was way better than oatmeal.  I hoofed it over to the post office since they closed at 11 am for lunch.  The hiker box at the post office was loaded with protein bars, dinners, and other resupply stuff.  The protein bars alone were gold since they're usually 2 bucks a pop.  I stashed 10 of them.  I headed across town to the convenience store where everything was triple the price.  I just got bagels and Gatorade there.  Before heading out I went to The Doyle to have a drink.  
Vicky was working the bar at The Doyle.  She had owned it for 17 years and wondered why she got in the business in the first place.  She was always joking around with the hikers but mentioned that they should keep in line unless they wanted to meet Queen Bitch.  I ordered a pint of Yuengling and hung out.  I asked her why you could see through the floor to the next bathroom.  Apparently hikers kept flooding the floors in the bathroom and the ceiling tiles would fall out from the floor below.  She didn't want to keep replacing them.  Rocky rolled into The Doyle.  Vicky checked his ID and she affectionately called him a puppy since he was only 19.  In her hotel register she had a space called ""Pup"" and marked Rocky's with an X.  It was getting later in the day and I decided to head out.  I wanted to do 15 miles but it might be less with me starting at 1 pm.
I walked for 2 miles on road through the town, by highways, and over two massive rivers.  The real hard part was just about to begin.  The start was a 600 foot climb up rocks.  I was already feeling tired by this point and kept yawning.  Maybe I spent too much time in town but still needed to pull through.  I got up to the ridgeline then was greeted with about a quarter mile of rocks.  My rock hopping skills are not advanced yet so I slowly made my way across them.  After about 2 miles, I came to the first shelter and grabbed some water.  Grey Goose an older woman who I met in Cumberland valley was taking a break there.  She was taking on this part of the trail like a champ.   I got water then headed on.  The trail eased out until the next shelter.  I was still going slow because my toes had a few blisters from the day before.  I arrived at the Peters Mountain shelter around 8 pm.  
A few hikers were in the shelter already.  They said the water source was a steep descent with 300 rock steps.  I wasn't looking forward to that.  As I was setting up my tent a woman named Quetzal showed up.  She was from Mexico City and had started hiking the trail on May 23rd.  She was at the same point I was and started two months later. She had already hiked the Hayduke which is an 800 mile trail in Utah.  Then jumped on the AT to thru hike the whole thing.  She hiked the PCT the previous year and showed me some intense pictures of hiking through snow in the sierras.  I was amazed how much miles she covered in such a short time.  My feet would fall apart if I did that many miles.  She had built the website http://www.zelzinaketzalli.com to record her feats.  I believe she's on to do the CDT next.  We talked until 10 pm then I called it a night.

The elevation profile for today was really flat.  They should say that Pennsylvania is flat instead of Virginia.  There were rocks on the trail but not they were not too crazy yet.  I was skipping along and tapping my poles to the beat of the band Washed Out. It made the hike flow. I followed the trail for 6 miles then came to a road crossing with a water source.  I sat by the river, took my shoes and socks off, then placed them in the cold water.  The water helped my ankles with inflammation.  A hiker named Rosie showed up.  He had been speeding on the trail like Quetzal and had started May 21st.  He said he wanted to slow down to hang out more instead of doing consistent 30 mile days.  He also mentioned that his friend Lupan was helping a trail angel bring magic to the gap today.  I was excited for the prospect of free grub.  We hung out for about an hour and a half.  I decided to roll out because I didn't want to arrive too late at the next shelter about 11 miles away.  I would have to miss out on this magic but I know there will be more. 
The rest of the trail had rocks but again it never got too wild.  A sign said the trail was most difficult but l didn't find it so. The only hard thing was my toes had seemed to become blister magnets in the new shoes.  I had 5 blisters since I started using them.  They sting at first but then become a dull pain.  Hopefully my toes become tougher to handle the shoes.  I may have to think about sizing up since that seems to be what could be causing it.  I hiked another 11 miles to the shelter area.  A lot of hikers were camping next to the river. I found a spot but it was right under a widow maker.  I walked up to the shelter and met a man named Mission who had started on March 14th.  I had never met him before.  I setup my tent again without the rain fly then made mashed potatoes and spam for dinner.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597268,"Last night it didn't get too cold.  The stars shown brightly though the tree cover.  I woke up at 5 am but slept in until 7:30 am.  I didn't feel like getting out of bed but I needed to make some miles anyways.  I packed up then headed over to the shelter to make breakfast.  A hiker named I walk with Jesus was there.  He had been sectioning the trail for some time.  He packed too much food and offered me some ramen, oatmeal, nuts, and jerky.  I gladly accepted the free food.  I made oatmeal and coffee for breakfast.  I eventually headed out at 9 am.  
The trail was flat again and a little rocky.  Not like the crazy rocks we were promised.  I hiked a mile then came to a beaver dam.  Beavers had made a barrier of sticks and mud to create a shallow swamp.  They use the swamp to build the their beaver lodges which keeps them safe from predators.  The whole trail was flooded from the dam.  I had to jump from log to log to keep my feet from getting wet.  At the last section my foot fell in the swamp.  Luckily it dried in a few hours.  In another few miles I came to a log bridge about 5 feet in the air.  I initially tripped on the log then fell on it.  My trekking poles fell in the water below as I straddled the log.  I got up and kept moving.  At the gap a man named Mike was giving out trail magic.  He had soda, beer, and candy.  I had it all.  His wife was in Texas and told him to get out and do magic.  Rosie and Lupine showed up.  They mentioned the trail magic from yesterday was only at night.  We hung out then hiked out together.  
We came to the next road crossing and planned to hitch into Lickdale for some grub.  We tried for 10 minute to get a car to stop but they all zoomed by.  Many were only filled with one person.  Rosie tried showing some thigh but it didn't work.  We moved up the road to give the cars more runway to stop.  Eventually a man in a pick-up stopped.  Lupine and I jumped in the back while Rosie sat in the cab.  I love the feeling of wind blowing over me while in the back of a pick-up.  He dropped us off at the gas station where we got iced coffee.  I walked over to Subway and got a footlong with all the veggies.  I met them at the Wendys and we all hung out for awhile.  Rosie was picking on Lupine about a bet he won and got to use Lupine's inflatable pillow for the night.  
We all got a hitch back to the trail at 3:30 pm.  The humidity was really high.  The climb up to the ridgeline was brutally hot.  My elbows turned into faucets as sweat dripped off them.  We got to the top and was greeted with a flat trail.  After about 5 miles we came to a view and ate snacks there. We were going to shelter about 8 miles from there but settled on one only 2.7 away.  It was getting late and we didn't want to hike through the dark. We pushed for an hour then arrived at the shelter area.  I setup my camp and ate ramen for dinner.  A hiker named Giggles camped in our same area.  Rosie asked eat of us what was our thorn, our bud, and flower for today.  Thorn was what didn't go well.  I said I didn't get moving as early as I did today.  A bud was what went well.  I was happy to go on the food excursion to get Subway.  The flower was what are looking forward to tomorrow.  The shower at the 501 shelter.  At 9:30 pm we called it a night.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597617,"This morning I woke up to the sound of deer antlers crashing.  It sounded like two deer trying to establish dominance in the area.  There were a few clashes and then nothing else.  I went back to sleep until 6:30 am.  I got up and packed my bag.  I ate some poptarts then hit the trail around 7:30 am for the 501 shelter about 4 miles away.  Thunder was already in the air.
The trail followed a flat road bed for a few miles.  In the distance I could see lightning striking other tree tops.  I would count after each strike to see how far it was away.  It still seemed to be awhile out.  I came to a gap then it started sprinkling.  Soon it was a full downpour.  I put on my poncho then went sloshing in the rain.  The rain fell harder and harder.  The trail became large puddles and mud.  The storm seemed to strike more and more as the main cell passed over the mountain.  It felt like I was going to get hit by lightning but I knew trees were overhead.  They would get struck first instead of me except I was also sloshing through puddles of water.   After about 2 miles I came to a small sign pointing me to the 501 shelter.  
As I approached the 501 I noticed it had a massive sky light in the shape of an octagon.  It was a fully enclosed shelter and had a care taker who lived next door.  Rosie and Lupine were already there when I arrived.  It was an excellent place to shelter from the rain.  A hiker named Smoke and two others were there.  With the weather being so bad we were thinking of zeroing here.  We also started salivating over the prospect of ordering pizza from the shelter.  The care taker walked in and offered us a ride into town.  He said the pizza place didn't deliver until 4 pm but we could pick it up.  He asked if anyone needed to resupply.  Rosie, Lupine, Smoke, and I did.  We put in a huge order then headed to town.  The care taker needed to do some errands.  We stopped at the bank and convenience store. He was pretty quick then we stopped by the local grocery store for our resupply.  They had a huge gummy section and I bought 2 pounds of gummies.  After the grocery, we headed over to the Italian restaurant and picked up our food.  We had pizza, calzones, tacos, mozzarella sticks, breaded mushrooms, and pizza fries.  Back at the shelter we gorged on all the food and hung out for a few hours.  The sky cleared up and it turned into a beautiful day.  Rosie, Lupine, and I decided to push another 6 miles to a campsite with swimming.  
The 6 miles went by pretty quick. The rocks in that section were not that bad.  At the campsite there was a lot of water. I setup my tent on a tent pad.  The rock fire pit next to the tent pad had a rattlesnake curled up in it.  The snake didn't care about us around the site.  It just poked its head out once and awhile to check out the area.  A little further down the blue blaze trail there was an old dam that created a small lake and it had a rope swing.  Squirrel and Brian were already there.  They mentioned that the water was really cold but refreshing.  Rosie swung out first he came up yelling about the coldness.  I swung out and hit the water.  The coldness hit me and sucked the breath out of me.  I quickly swam to shore and got out.  After shuffling out of the lake the air felt much warmer.  Squirrel decided to go in again except he climbed the tree and he could easily slip off it.  He got on the branch then swung out wide and landed in the water with a huge splash.  After swimming we all made dinner and hung out. I made couscous which was pretty filling.  Jaipur rolled in at about 8 pm.  He looked pretty tired from all the rock hopping.  Another hiker named Space Bear showed up.  He had been battling Lyme disease and had been taking antibiotics.  He said that they gave him diarrhea though.  It was hard for him to sleep at night because he didn't know when his body really needed to go.  It got late and I decided to call it a night.
Tonight I hope the rattlesnake doesn't get too cozy next to my tent.","William Penn Shelter

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597618,"This morning there wasn't a snake sleeping next to my tent.  It was still held up in its fireplace den.  I got up and ate my cold soaked oatmeal for breakfast.  We headed out around 7 am.  
The trail was pretty flat again.  It didn't change in variation much and there were some rocks.  Our shoes were still wet from yesterday's rain.  Rosie and Lupine left the campsite first.  I eventually ran into Rosie near a sign.  He pulled back his shirt to reveal he was wearing a bra.  He had found it hanging on a sign.  We planned a little joke on Lupine.  I said it was getting too hot out here and decided to take off my shirt.  Rosie decided to take off his revealing the bra to Lupine.  We all laughed then headed out keeping the bra with us.  We hiked for about 10 miles then hung out at a view to eat lunch and dry out our clothes.  I needed to bounce my box from Boiling Springs to Delaware Water Gap.  On the phone the post office clerk said it was delivered to a residence even though it was supposed to be general delivery.  The clerk had me call the Carlisle office since they delivered the mail.  They got my name and number.  I was expecting my package to be  gone but after 10 minutes I got a call back from the Boiling Springs office. The clerk walked over to the residence and found that the package was still there!  I was relieved and had them bouch it to Delaware Water Gap.  We moved down a steep decline and eventually came to Port Clinton.  
Rosie was already in town and went to the local candy shop.  He bought sodas for Lupine and I.  I was excited about a cold drink and drank it very quickly.  As we were waiting for Lupine a man named John Harrison invited us into the Port Clinton Fire Company bar.  I had recognized the door of the bar from a website about pub crawls on the AT.  The bar was part of the fire station that was volunteer only.  The fire station used it to raise funds for its operations.  A member had to sign us into the bar since we were guests.  John bought all of us our first round. We met a guy named Tom who Lupine knew since Hiawassee.  He offered us slack packing service and told us about a sketchy guy named the mechanic.  The mechanic lives next to the trail and dumps out water caches so hikers have to use his stream.  The mechanic has creeped out several people.  We ordered pizza at the bar and french fries. It was also happy hour and beers were only a $1.  John then bought us shots and we hung out there until 8 pm.  We were planning on hiking to the next shelter but not in our current condition.  In town was a pavilion and tenting field for hikers.  We headed over there and put up our tents.  We didn't feel like cooking.  I ate a peanut butter and bagel sandwich.  It got late and I went to bed.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597621,"I woke up to birds chirping at 5 am but I didn't want to get up.  I slept in until 6:30 am since I hung out at the bar late last night.  Tom showed up and asked us if we wanted to slack pack.  I wanted to have all my gear on me and declined.  Another guy offered the same service and I had him carry my food bag since it was the heaviest.  He also drove us to the local diner called the 3 C's.  It was under construction because a car crashed into the building.  It was right on the highway.  Lupine was thinking about quitting coffee but she just couldn't right now and ordered a cup.  I ordered the big breakfast that included bacon, ham, hash browns, eggs, french toast, and toast.  I finished most of it except the eggs.  We got picked up an hour later then headed out on the trail.
It was a steep climb up to the ridgeline but not as bad as other climbs I've been on.  Our plan was to push for the Eckville shelter for lunch then go to the next shelter.  Once we got to the top it started sprinkling then raining.  We played in the rain.  My shoes were soaked again and my feet were prunes.  There was some rocks but they were not that bad.  One part of the trail was an old service road.  We talked about having a photoshoot with the bra that we found for a hiker calendar.  We thought of different things that thru hikers do like resupplying, showering at a shelter, grocery shopping, etc.  All the scenes would include a man wearing the bra.  We ran through the rain as we got closer to the Eckville shelter.  We arrived a little while later.  The shelter was fully enclosed and had a flushing toilet and shower.  I saw Grey Goose there whom I hadn't seen since I lost her in the rain storm a few days earlier.  She didn't see the sign for the 501 shelter in the storm and walked right by it.  I ate my lunch then took a quick shower.  I got back on the trail at 5:30 pm.
This is the point were Pennsylvania showed its teeth in the form of bolders.  There were rocky sections seemed to go on for a quarter mile.  You could easily slip and end your thru hike if you were not careful enough.  They also tend to harbor rattlesnakes during the day.  I skipped on the tops of the rocks to move faster.  Sometimes my foot would slide sideways and I would catch myself.  After about 2 hours I met up with Lupine on the trail.   We hiked together to the Allentown shelter.  It started raining again and getting dark.   The combination of rain, dark, and wet bolders didn't appeal to me or Lupine.  At one point it started pouring.  We still managed to move across the rock fields.  Some rocks were more slippery than others.  It became hard to see the rocks and we donned our headlamps.  The slippery rocks were shiny and we tried to avoid them.  All I could think about was getting to the shelter before I got hurt.  We came to a junction and saw Rosie's trekking pole with his buff on it and knew we made it.  At the shelter most of the tenting spots were taken and I decided to sleep in the shelter.  I made Mac and cheese for dinner and hung out for a little bit before calling it a night.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597624,"I woke up to the birds chirping and Rosie rolling around in his bivy sack.  The rain had stopped during the night and the sun was out.  I was happy that we were going to have a dry day.  I ate a protein bar for breakfast then headed out.  About .3 down trail I got water at a spring. Lupine was making her cowgirl coffee and shared some with me.  Rosie had quit coffee 4 months ago but had a sip.  It might not be long before he's drinking coffee again.  We headed out from there.  
The water sources on the trail today were all a half mile down the trail except for the last shelter before town. We decide to camel water and carry enough for most of the trek.  The trail was flat all the way to town but there were bolder fields in the way.  Some of the fields were exposed to the sun.  The rocks were a lot easier to skip across than yesterday since they were not wet.  In some areas the rocks were so slanted that I had to lean far enough so I didn't slip.  A few times I had to jump down boulders.  We all stopped at a water source that was .3 downhill and other hikers were there.  They had already went down and brought back extra water to share with us.  We pushed on.  I made sure to reserve my water for the rest of the hike.  From the ridgeline there were plenty of view points along the way.   Most were from the boulders we were hiking across.  My ankle started acting up from all the rock hopping.  I had to slow down and let Lupine and Rosie hike ahead.  I hiked on listening to Radio Lab until the shelter before town.  Rosie and Lupine were there hanging out.  I got another liter of water at the spring then hiked to the access road. 
We walked to the stop light and put out or thumbs.  A guy in a small white car waved us in.  Both Rosie and I got in the back of the car while Lupine sat in the front.  We tried to rush and squeeze into the clown car before the light turned green.  I don't know why both the tallest people got in the back though. It was a quick ride to Bert's, a local restaurant in town that also had a hostel.  When we arrived we checked in at the restaurant and they showed us the room.  It was basically an apartment with a living room and a shared bedroom.  It had a TV with a bunch of movies.  Two other hikers were going to show up but they never did and we had the whole place to ourselves.  We walked to the Chinese restaurant and order a ton of food.  We then walked over to the local beer store and saw a bowling alley that had $1.50 games tonight. I was excited about the prospect of bowling.  We took our food and beer back to the apartment and chowed down while watching episodes of Seinfeld.  At about 9:30 pm we decided to play one game at the bowling alley.  I called them and they mentioned they closed at 10 pm. We didn't have enough time to play one game.  We took showers and hung outside instead.  The hour approached midnight and we called it.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598318,"Last night the bunk room got hot.  Rosie and I decided to move the mattresses in the living room where Lupine was sleeping and have a slumber party.  We rearranged the chairs so we could fit both mattresses in the room.  It was a tight fit but we managed to do it.  The window AC made the room frigid and I have to grab my sleeping bag.  It was better than sleeping in a hot room.  We woke up well rested and ordered take out right next door from Bert's.  I got the creamed chipped brisket with home fries.  We hung out in the living room watching the movie Hide and Seek.  We did laundry in Bert's basement while we watched the movie.  Check out was 11 am and we hung out outside after check out.  The woman who ran the hostel made us feel that we had to leave so we packed up and hit the town.
Lupine and I needed to go to the post office so we headed down there while Rosie hit up the local coffee shop.  I got a resupply box at the post office with my replacement foot inserts, dinners, and protein bars. Lupine got some Oreos from her friend and other fun stuff.  We stopped at the local ice cream shop since the day was only heating up.  We met Rosie at the coffee shop and hung out for a few hours.  I ate my leftover lo mein from last night which didn't make me sick.  I broke down the resupply and packed everything into my food bag.  Rosie and Lupine went to the grocery while I headed over to the barber shop.  Over the past few days my hair had been getting into my eyes and I needed a trim.  The barber told me that she used to get more thru hikers in town but this year there wasn't as many.   I said most hikers were probably deterred from coming to Palmerton because there were not many places to stay and the police started cracking down on hikers sleeping in the park.  With my hair shorter it felt like I had less wind drag.  I walked down the road to meet Rosie and Lupine at the grocery store.  Rosie picked up a few items for me.  We stopped by Dunkin donuts for bagels and water then headed outside to hitch back to the trail.  A guy on his lunch break saw us and offered us a ride.  We noticed that he was wearing a workout outfit.  Rosie asked him if he had just finished working out.  It was a strange question and he said he just got on break from his job.  We got a quick ride back to the trailhead. 
Back on the trail we found a note saying not to trust the mechanic man.  He never showed up to pick up a few hikers.  We had heard from Tom in Port Clinton about him.  I don't think we'll run into him since we planned on carrying enough water to not rely on him.  The initial climb out of Lehigh gap was steep.  There were large boulders that we had to scramble up. The view from the climb was beautiful as we could see the valley below.  I had to put my trekking poles away since I had to use my hands.  Sometimes it felt like my pack would pull me backwards with all the water weight that I was carrying.  We eventually got to the top and noticed a large fence.  It was a revitalization area for plants and wildlife to combat the heavy metals that were dumped on the mountain from zinc smelting.  It had taken several years to grow plants on the mountain.   We ran into a guy named Kent who Rosie and Lupine saw the other day.  They had asked Kent how he was doing and he replied by saying that he was constitutional.  Which Rosie and Lupine had to look up.  Apparently it was a New England phrase.  Kent said that he lived in the town when the zinc smelting was still operational.  Back then you couldn't see more than 150 feet from all the smoke in the air.  When they dumped the slag from the operation it poisoned the whole mountain.  Some trees had started growing back but they tent to pull the heavy metals out of the ground.  When the trees die they don't decompose since bacteria has a difficult time growing.  We said our goodbyes to Kent then pressed on.  The trail was flat and we had a continuous view of the valley.  We ran into a berry bush but refrained from eating from it since it could contain heavy metals.  The sun started setting and we watched as it disappeared over the mountain.   Night fell and we night hiking over rocks and boulders.  Lupine hadn't been feeling well and we stopped after 6 miles in a pine forest.   The pine needles had made the ground soft to setup a tent.  I got everything setup and made chicken with mashed potatoes.  We talked about other shooting prospects with the bra.  It started to get late and I hit the tent.

The first water source was at the blue mountain ski resort.  There was a small piece of paper on the trail pointing us the way to the resort.  We took a barely visible side trail to the ski slopes of the resort.  We walked along the slopes following the ski signs to the lodge.  It was a huge resort that had a lodge overlooking the valley below.  At the lodge we used the restrooms and filled up our water bottles.  We would be carrying 3 liters of water over 10 miles.  Lupine wanted to look more like Rosie and she wanted her sleeves removed.  Rosie cut the sleeves off and Lupine had started her transformation.  We hiked on from the resort to the shelter about 10 miles away.  The trail was mostly rocks that made your ankles work extra hard.  I had to take a few breaks to let my feet rest.  We pushed onto the shelter to eat lunch and get our next water supply.  I ate 3 bagels for lunch to make sure I had eaten enough carbs.  We did the .3 trek to get water.  The first spring was dry, the second spring was a puddle, and the third had flowing water.  We sat and hung out while we filled our bottles and listened to our tramily's theme song.  I had really bad gas today and kept apologizing for my farts.  My body had been digesting a lot of food recently.  It was never ending.  Hopefully my body works out whatever it needs to do. We headed out on the 14 mile trek without water to the next shelter.
The ridgeline had some excellent views and most had berry bushes around them.  I would peer out just to eat more berries.  I made it to a view with a good sitting rock and took the time write a journal entry.  A hiker named Rainbow Scorpion showed up and gave me some good intel on Delaware water gap.  There was an excellent bakery in town and that you should resupply at Walmart instead of the gas station in town.  That was all I needed to know.  A little later Lupine and Rosie passed and headed for wind gap.  I finished up and headed down the mountain.  
Wind gap was a small mobile home community.  I didn't go into town but found a water cache on my way up the other side.  I took a 1/2 liter and drank it all since I didn't know if I would make it to the shelter.  It was already around 7 pm and we still had to hike another 9 miles.   The trek on the other side was more rocks.  This day had the most rocks compared to previous days.  Night fell and we were hiking again on rocks in the dark.  Lupine and my feet were in pain and we decided to camp early before the shelter.  We found a flat spot and setup our tents.  I made mashed potatoes and ate my last bagel.  Rosie was planning on waking up early to make it to the post office before it closed at 11 am.  He set his alarm for 5 am.  After dinner I went to bed.

Lupine pointed out blueberry bushes next to our site.  There were bushes everywhere!  I ate a whole bunch and didn't want to stop however we needed to get to town.
The trail was still mostly rocks.  We came to wolfs rocks which were not as intense as other rock sections in PA.  They were mostly large slanted slabs but were easier to hike on than the smaller rocks on trail.  There were several day hikers out since it was the weekend.  Lupine and I got to the shelter where we were supposed to go last night.  It had a spigot for water since the spring was dry.  We filled our water and snacked by the shelter.  We met Pistol and Pinch there.  They had gotten off trail for 5 days since Pinch had a throat infection that was really intense.  He thought it was going to end his thru hike.  Luckily on day 5 it finally got better.  We headed out the last 6 miles to Delaware water gap.
The remaining trek had some rocks but also an easy dirt road to hike on.  It was so easy that I started hiking backwards for a bit.  We came to a descent and it was blocked by 60 high school students. We managed to push past them weaving in and out of the different groups. After passing them we realized that Lupine had the bra hanging off her pack.  Those teens must have been snickering to themselves about it.  We passed more day hikers then rolled into town.
Rosie had been napping by the bakery since he had been there already for 6 hours.  Lupine and I were starving and ate at the first place that seemed to have good food.  It was a local pizza joint and it was delicious.  Maybe it was the spices and dough or maybe because we were starving.  Lupine, Rosie, and I ate an extra large pizza and garlic knots.  The pizza was way better than any pizza in the south.  We headed to the bakery afterwards.  I ordered the love affair which was a piece of pie and a hot dog.  After eating we went to the outfitters for fuel and socks.  The owner was able to repair my pack since the ladder locks had been slipping on the straps.  He didn't charge me anything for the service.  We then hitched to Walmart for our resupply which was overwhelming as usual.  I bought more food than I needed to make sure I didn't run out.  At Walmart we debated going back on the trail when it was supposed to rain all night.  We decided to stay at the local church in town instead.   At the church, there were several hikers.  We claimed a spot in the bunk room and then went outside to cook dinner.   We bought ravioli and salads for dinner.   We needed some greens.  Outside it was raining but we stayed dry under the awning.  We made dinner and shared some with Pantalones who I hadn't seen since Damascus.  He talked about staying with The Mechanic man and had a pretty decent time.  Pantalones mentioned that Mechanic man stole unattended trail magic since animals could get into it.  I called Theresa to catch up from the week.  It felt good to hear her voice.  I started to get tired and curled up on my bunk.

The initial walk out of town was next to the highway.  I saw the NJ/PA border in the distance.  Lupine was ecstatic to finally be leaving PA that she ran in the rain without care.  We got pictures of us crossing over.  It instantly felt different once we got back in the woods.  The air, streams, and rocks felt better than Pennsylvania.  It just felt good to be in New Jersey.  We hiked the initial 5 miles to sunfish pond. There were couple women there who were trail runners.  They were on our heels most of the time but didn't manage to pass us.  We ate snacks at the pond.  Rosie and Lupine packed out hummus and bread.   Their snacks were amazing.  I had some cheez its, cookies, and a protein bar.  Rosie decided to do get some bra shots on the lake.  We got a couple pictures of him wearing only a bra and underwear looking off into the distance.  We pushed on to the next water source about 3.5 miles away.
The walk on the ridgeline was beautiful.  There were views all along it.  The trail was also covered with blue berries!  So many berry bushes as far as I could see.  I stopped a few times to eat the fruit. I had to stop eating or I would get far behind.  There is more bear activity in New Jersey since they have so much berries to eat.   We came to a breathtaking view of the Delaware Water Gap and stopped for a break.  The land below looked so green and lush.  We then headed a few miles to our lunch location.  It was another view of the valley.  I ate two bagels with ham and cheese.  Rosie and Lupine packed out curry and rice for lunch.  Again, their meal was way better than mine.  I ate a second bagel to make sure I had enough calories.  After lunch it was easy rolling along the ridgeline.  The rocks were still there but not as sharp and jagged as PA.  
We pushed another 7 miles to crater lake and filled up our water bottles for the stealth site.  At the lake I wanted to build a bridge out from the shore to make it easier to fill.  I started throwing rocks in the lake one by one.  At one point Rosie was on a rock and I aimed at getting him wet.  I threw a huge rock and the splash backfired.  It got Lupine totally wet from the front.  It was really funny and she though so too.  Until she said I was in the dog pound until further notice.  
We pushed another mile to the stealth site and setup camp.  Our area was right under a hemlock tree and the ground was soft.  I realized as I was setting up my tent that I left my tent poles at the church in Delaware Water Gap.  I needed them to pitch out my rain fly since it was supposed to rain tonight.  Luckily Lupine and Rosie had extras to spare.  We all sat next to each other and cooked our dinners.  I had another one of my dehydrated meals and never seemed to get sick of them.  We listened to tiny desk concerts as we cooked our food.  The mosquitos had gotten worse and I needed to guard my legs from them. Hiker midnight rolled around and I got into bed.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598327,"I woke up to rain hitting my rain fly.  The water was pooling around my tent but luckily it didn't get in.  We called the large puddle ""lake bramily.""  It then rained harder and we didn't want to pack anything down because it would get wet anyways.  I ended up eating poptarts in my tent.  Lupine made some coffee and that really helped me get ready for the day.  The rain stopped at 8 am.  We hurried and packed everything up while it stopped.  We then hiked out around 9 am.  
The rain started again but it was more of a sprinkle. The tree canopy helped block the rain as we hiked.  We got water then planned on hiking 10 miles to a shelter for lunch.  The trail was wet and my feet were soaked.  My socks were grinding into my feet and at one point I had to stop to take care of a blister on my middle toe.  I didn't see Lupine or Rosie for ten miles to the shelter.  On the way I met a hiker named Lauren who showed me all the newts on the ground.  They were a dark orange and I had trouble seeing them in the leaves.  It was probably because I was color blind and the newts blended in perfectly.  I came to a road that had a tavern but decided to walk on because I had so much food still.  On the other side of the road I ran into Rolly who I hadn't seen since the roller coaster in Virginia.  He was waiting for a package in the near by town.  I caught up with him and he gave me a swig of his bourbon.  Feeling warmer I headed onto the shelter.  
At the shelter, Spot was already eating there.  I sat next to him and built myself some bagel, ham, and cheese sandwiches.  Spot had thru hiked the trail 5 times since 1996 and had seen it change over the years.  People had flip phones back then but they hardly worked.  The main way of communicating was through the log books at the shelters.   He told me about a few swimming holes coming up but with all this rain I might not hit a single one in New Jersey.  I made a couple bagels with ham and cheese for lunch.  The mosquitos were in full force at this shelter.  Spot was smart and had long sleeves and pants.  I was eaten alive.  I got more water and quickly got out of there.
A mile down the trail I ran into Rosie and Lupine.  They thought I was way ahead but I took a lot of time to eat lunch.  We were going to hike to high point state park about 11 miles away.  There were still a lot of rocks on the trail.  We reached a shelter were I changed into dry socks since my pinky toes were killing me.  The sky darkened and it started to rain again.  It was a little at first then a sudden downpour.  My dry socks were instantly soaked.  We started climbing small rocky mountains in the wet and cold.  Our shoes would slosh in the puddles between the rocks.  Some areas were steep with sharp jagged rocks and we made sure to go slow over those areas.  After a slow crawl we came to a clearing and we were at the state park.  We were hoping for a gazebo to camp under but there wasn't one in sight.  Luckily there was a water spigot were we could fill up.  We walked over to the hiker parking lot and found a grassy area next to the lot.  There was a lull in the rain which gave us enough time to setup our tents.  We cooked our food on the picnic table nearby.  I made a pasta dish for dinner.  While we were eating it started to downpour.  It was the saddest meal on the trail yet.  I quickly finished my food and got into my tent.  Inside my rain fly was so saturated that it started dripping inside my tent.  The water was hitting my shoulders.  I put my fleece in that area so it got wet instead of my sleeping bag.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598330,"It was still raining out when I woke up.  Rosie and Lupine had stayed up until 2:30 am watching Portlandia.  There was a lull in the rain and I quickly packed up.  I ate some poptarts for breakfast then it started raining again.  It was a sad breakfast.  The rain didn't let up in the morning.  We were only going to Unionville, NJ to meet up with Lupine's friend John.  
The trail was still rocky in this part of the state.  After we crossed a certain area, the land got flatter and the rocks disappeared.  It reminded me what the trail used to look like. I was happy to not have rocks.  Rosie and I came to a wooden structure with  a viewpoint.  We climbed up it and was instantly greeted with a 220 foot obelisk on the next mountain.  It was the highest point in New Jersey.  We then hiked to one area that was a large swamp.  There were boardwalks to let us cross except they were really slippery.  I imagined falling into the swamp and how I would deal with it.  Spot told me there were sections in Maine were the boardwalks were under a foot of water.  If you fell off you would probably be up to your shoulders in water.  The trail smoothed out and we were arrived at the access road to Unionville.  
Lupine's friend John came by and picked us up in his car.  I decided to only do 9 miles today since having someone with a car means I can get a lot of errands done quickly.  The first order of business was to the post office to pickup our package drops.  Rosie and I both got our sandels!   We had been talking about hiking in them for days.  The rocks had ended and it was safe again to hike in sandals.   We then went to a local deli where I got a rubeini which was a ruben panini.  It was so good.   New Jersey is filled with delis.  I didn't realize there was such a deli culture here.  As we were eating, the deli owner gave us some prepackaged apple pies that had expired.  We knew from the amount of preservatives in them they were still good.  After eating we went to the laundry mat and washed our dirty clothes after many days of rain.  Our clothes still smelled after washing them but at least they were still clean.  We also laid out all our stuff to dry in the parking lot.  It looked like a hiker trash garage sale.  Both Rosie and I were in our rain suits while doing laundry.  The locals in the town got a free show.  One woman mentioned that she saw Rosie's goods.  I laughed really hard at that.  With our clothes dry we went to the grocery for our resupply.  I ended up buying way to much food but I needed the calories anyways.  
We drove back to Unionville were you could camp in the local park next to the basketball courts.  Apparently you needed a permit to camp from the local general store but it was closed by the time we got there.  At the camp a man named Butch said he really didn't care about us not having permits and we setup camp.  We bought curries and rice for dinner and cooked on the basketball court.  We all shared our different curries with each other.  The sky had cleared up for a little break from the rain.  I laid back on the asphalt and watched the clouds roll by.  Past the clouds I could see the stars.  After dinner I crashed in my tent.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598334,"I heard rain hitting my fly in the middle of the night.  The rain had come again.  I went back to sleep until 7 am.  In the morning it was still sprinkling and I didn't want to get out of my tent.  It let up for a little bit and I quickly packed up my stuff.  Lupine and John were sharing a tent.   Lupine said she wasn't hiking today because her feet had been beaten up by the several days of rain.   She wanted to rest them and let them heal.  Rosie and I understood. We were still planning on hiking 17 miles today to a drive in movie theater where you could camp.  I hung out in the gazebo while Lupine and John got their stuff together.  I ate some bananas, oranges, and muffins for breakfast. We then headed over to the local general store for 2nd breakfast.  I got a sandwich with eggs, cheese, and sausage.   It was really good and I was stuffed.  I was sad to be splitting up with Lupine today since we had hiked so many days together.  I'm sure our paths will cross again. John dropped Rosie and I off on the trail and we had a heartfelt goodbye with Lupine.  
Back on the trail my feet were getting used to hiking in Chacos again.  There didn't seem to be any pain in my ankle or arch and my feet were free again.  The trail was pretty gradual and didn't have too many rocks.   There was still lots of mud from the several days of rain.  Rosie and I arrived at a long boardwalk and we stopped under a tree for lunch.   I ate a Pad Thai meal that I had been given by a couple of hikers who were doing a relay of the AT for LL Bean.  As we were eating it started to rain.  It rained so much that the trees couldn't protect us anymore.  It unloaded its wet leaves onto us.  I quickly covered my stuff with my poncho.  The rain let up again and we headed out.  The boardwalk went over a large section of wetlands for about a mile.  In another mile we came to a mountain which was a 1000 foot climb.  It was entirely covered with boulders.  We hadn't had a climb like that in some time.  The rocks were slippery and wet from days of rain.  I huffed up the mountain and made my way to the top.  There was a spectacular view of the valley below.  I could see the wetlands we hiked through as well as the New Jersey high point in the distance.
It started sprinkling then raining hard.  I got on my poncho in time before the downpour.  My feet were soaking again as I hiked through the mud puddles on the trail.  At one point I came to a gap with a cooler.  It was trail magic!  I slammed a root beer then hiked on.  In one section there as a huge puddle.  I walked carelessly through it to find that it came up to my knees.  Luckily I didn't fall into it!  After another mile I met up with Rosie and we pushed on to the shelter.  We didn't think the drive in was happening tonight with all this rain.  At the shelter it was pretty jammed packed with hikers already.  Cosmic and Naked Santa were there! I hadn't seen them in sometime.  We talked about the caboose crew.  Apparently Stealth had taken a zero and was now behind me.  It was good to hear that I was catching up on them.  Everyone in the shelter made room for Rosie and I.  We were going to be jammed packed in there like sardines.  I would be sleeping at the foot of the shelter since the rest of the space was taken up.  I made my enchilada meal in the rain and tried quickly to eat it but it was way too hot.  All I could think about is crawling into my sleeping bag for the night.  After dinner I stripped off my wet clothes and got into my bag.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598955,"Last night the mosquitos were making a feast of my face in the shelter.  I had to put bug repellent on to keep them off my face.  Rosie had the same problem.  I didn't sleep too well last night but I knew I could push through today.  Rosie had headed out to the state park about .2 miles away.  They had a bathroom with a forceful blow dryer.  He was looking to dry out his socks.  I got up and packed my stuff and headed over to the state park.  
I found Rosie next to the bathroom.  He had done his business.  I used the hand dryer to dry out my socks from the night before.  It was jet powered and dried them really fast.  I ate some muffins for breakfast.  I decided to take my time to catch up on my journal entries and Rosie pushed on.  I stayed at the state park for 4 hours.  At 1 pm I got back on the trail.  
As soon as I left the park I heard a familiar voice call my name.  It was Stealth!  He had taken a zero and I caught up to him.  I was really glad to see him.  He was thinking about when he would see me again.  On his backpack he pulled off a Tibetan prayer flag that he had made me.  He had been carrying it for sometime.  I hung it across my pack.  We rolled out together.  I got a call from Rosie saying he was going to stop at the Bellvale Creamery for ice cream in 10 miles.  That was excellent motivation for me to hike there.  The weather had cleared up and it started to get hotter.  I made sure to hydrate extra today.  We rolled through New Jersey on our way to the border.  The landscape started changing as we hiked over mountain tops that were carved by ice age glaciers.  We soon arrived at the NJ/NY border.   Scissors had sent a video of her twerking at the border.  Stealth and I decided to make our own twerking video to send to everyone else.  
We had another 5 miles until the creamery.   There were a few rock scrambles and really slanted areas.  Rosie said he was going to hitch to the drive in movie theater from the creamery since it wasn't supposed to rain tonight.  I really wanted to check it out because it was a unique experience to camp at a drive in.  Stealth and I took a blue blaze to the creamery.  We saw Tree Beard and Aladdin.  Tree Beard had an ice cream sundae that looked really good.  I went inside and ordered one.  It came with 3 scoops and 3 toppings.  The staff knew to load up the sundae for hungry hikers.  They added extra ice cream and toppings. It was so much food.  I happily ate the sundae but couldn't finish it all.   Tree Beard finished it for me.  I asked the hikers there if they wanted to go to the drive in and split a shuttle. It didn't seem like anyone wanted to go.  Stealth had spent a good amount of money during his zero and wanted to save some money.  He headed out to the next shelter.  Rosie sent me a number for a local shuttle driver named Josie.  I called her and she said she would pick me up in 30 minutes.  As I waited Aladdin said he wanted to go as well.   I called Josie 45 minutes later and she said she got a flat tire.  She gave me info for a local taxi driver.  I called them and they showed up 10 minutes later.  
At the Warwick drive in there were several hikers hanging out on the hill watching Mission Impossible.  They didn't charge hikers for watching movies either!  Rosie, Lupine, John, Spot, Naked Santa, Cosmic, and Easy Going were already there.  Easy Going handed me a beer.  I didn't really pay too much attention to the movies and hung out with everyone.  They were playing a double feature and the movies went on late into the night.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598999,"Last night Easy Win stayed up pretty late listening to an odd college station using the radio from the drive in.  He seemed that he was going to stay up all night in his tent with the radio playing.  I asked him to turn it down since the music was creeping me out.  The sun blasted my tent at 6:30 am and it instantly got hot.  There were no trees to block it from coming in.  Everyone started packing up and we walked over to the grocery store to get breakfast.  In the same plaza there was a bagel shop.  I got a bagel and coffee.  The bagels just seem to be better in New York.  We hung around by the grocery store.  Rosie called Josie to get a lift back to the Creamery.  While we were waiting for Josie a trail angel named Moose showed up.  He was giving Spot a ride back to the trail and offered us one.  He got his name when he night hiked in Maine and ran right into a moose's butt.  The moose turned around and tried to pound him into the ground with his hooves.  Moose took his jacket and threw it over the moose's head which made him docile.  I'll definitely remember that trick when I'm in Maine.  He headed out and came back 15 minutes later.  He had picked up Kayne and Zippy to take them back to the trail.  Except they were in a spot that would be an hour round trip.  Aladdin, Easy Win, and I waited and finally got a ride back.  
Back at the Creamery Rosie, Snags, and Cosmic were hanging out.  They were waiting for the creamery to open at noon.  Customers started rolling in at 11:30 to wait for ice cream.  We got Aladdin to have a photo shoot with the bra.   I found a jar of bubbles and added them to the background as Rosie took pictures.  Luckily no kids had shown up to the creamery.  Rosie wanted me to pose with two scoops of ice cream on my chest with the bra.  I didn't want to do it because it would be too sticky.  I wanted to eat more food and walked over to the hot dog stand down the road.   There was an older gentleman running it.  He told me that the next shelter had a really nasty privy.  Apparently they were going to replace it but the carpenter didn't want to haul lumber 2 miles into the woods.  He wanted to build it somewhere else and have a helicopter drop it in.  The ATC didn't want to do that because it would cost too much.  I got two hot dogs loaded with chili and kraut and walked back over to the creamery.  The creamery opened and I got a chocolate milkshake that had about a liter of ice cream.  By that time I probably had enough calories for the day.  It didn't seem like anyone else was going to leave.  I escaped the vortex of the creamery and headed back into the woods.  
The shelter was only 2 miles away and was a pretty easy hike.  By the time I got there I needed to use the privy since all that ice cream was going through my system.  At the shelter Easy Win was there drinking all the beers he packed out from the night before at the drive in.  I ran over to the privy to find that it was filled to the brim and poo water was leaking onto the floor boards.  I didn't want to use it and dug a hole instead.  Easy Win was following the weather.  It looked like we were going to get hit with rain again but it didn't seem consistent.  I headed out from there.  In 3 miles I met a hiker named Magic from the UK.  We hiked together until he met up his tramily.  He had funded his hike by selling his Bitcoin.  He didn't like talking about it much unless someone showed an interest.  We got to talking about English food and why it had such a bad rap.  He talked about the amazing sea food and comfort food.  I got hungry just talking about food.  We hiked up some pretty steep rocky climbs.  At some points I would just have to throw my trekking poles up and climb.  Magic met up with his tramily and I moved on.  I heard thunder in the distance.  When I climbed up a small mountain I could see a wall of rain and lightning heading my way.  I quickly ran down the trail to find a stealth site.  I didn't find any pads and had to make my own by moving sticks and rocks out of the way.  I setup my tent just in time before it started raining.  I cooked dinner in my tent's vestibule making sure not to burn my tent down.   I carefully ate in my tent without dropping any food for bears to smell.  I noticed that my rain fly was leaking again.  I'll need to seal it in the next town before another rain storm.  The hour flew past hiker midnight and it was time for sleep.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599048,"In the morning the rain had stopped and my things kept dry.  It felt like something was watching me in the forest.  I peeked out in the distance during the night with my headlamp looking for the reflection of eyes. There were none.  I got up and talked to Theresa.  There was a mouse in the apartment that had been visiting the food pantry every night.  It sounded like my usual nights at the shelter.  I made oatmeal for breakfast but had a hard time putting it down.  My body is starting to reject it.  Magic and his tramily passed my site.  They told me about a swimming spot in 6 miles.  It also had a shower which I was looking forward to after not showering for 7 days.  I packed up the rest of my stuff and headed out.
It seems that every climb in New York is covered in boulders.  It takes awhile to traverse them.  Aladdin and Snags caught up with me.  They had slept at the first shelter 2 miles past the creamery and didn't make it too far.  Snags looked like he jumped into a lake.  He was just sweating so much that he could wring sweat water out of his pants.  He thought he might be getting sick.  I offered him some energy chews with extra sodium but he already had some.  In about another mile was the lemon squeezer.  It was a foot wide space to wiggle through.  I had to take my pack off to get through it.  The harder part was after it with a small rock climb.  You could either blue blaze or climb up.  I decided to climb it.  Again I had to take my pack off because it was only pulling me backwards.  It took me a few tries but I finally pulled myself up.  I hiked on to Tiorati lake for a swim.  The place was packed with people since it was the weekend.  Several people were grilling and it smelled so good.  I tried Yogiing food my using my hungry face but no one was having it.  I walked over to the beach and jumped in the lake with my underwear.  It felt great!  I got out then used the shower to get all the grime off from 7 days.  I bought an orange creamsicle and ate lunch on a large boulder near everyone grilling.  The grill smoked wafted over me as I ate a bagel with peanut butter.  It was a sad comparison.  I headed out and ran into Cosmic on my way back to the trail.  She had also slept at the first shelter past the creamery.  We were both excited about going to the zoo and being an exhibit there for all the locals to stare at.  I pushed on and planned on camping on bear mountain about 11 miles away but heard it was super touristy and was hard to find stealth sites.  
Back on the trail I ran into a section hiker named Fetch who I had seen before.  We talked about international travel.  He had also taught English abroad in Japan.  The conversation moved to food as it always does.  We talked about all the great food in Southeast Asia.  Especially in Thailand and Vietnam. We arrived at the next shelter.  Fish was there who I hadn't seen since Devil's Backbone Brewery in Virginia.  He had taken off some time from the trail and was also hiking with his brother.   He gave me some good intel on where to resupply past Fort Montgomery.  A woman gave me some intel on where to camp past the next shelter since I wasn't going to make it to bear mountain.  I hiked on and climbed up black mountain.  In the distance I could barely see the NYC skyline.  It was difficult to see with all the haze in the air.  I climbed down into the valley and had to cross a highway with cars flying at 70 miles an hour.  It felt like I was in the video game frogger.  On the other side I filtered 3 liters of water since I would be stealthing without a water source.  The next climb was steep but trail maintainers had built rock steps.  At the top I watched the sun set behind some clouds.  I found the campsite with a view of West mountain and the Hudson river.  I setup camp and cooked chili with cheese for dinner.   The moon rose in the east.  Its full yellow body hid behind coulds.  Theresa called and told me about the amazing cookies in my next resupply package!  I'm super excited for them.  The hour hit 11 pm and it was time for bed.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599052,"I woke up at 5:30 am and saw that the sun hadn't come up over the mountain yet.  The sunrise was at 5:48 am.  I  hobbled out of the tent and walked over to the view to watch the sun come up.  As the first rays of light shined out over the mountain I played The Lion King's circle of life song.  The sun rose to meet the clouds and everything was bright orange.  I hobbled back to my tent and got ready for the day.  I made some oatmeal and coffee for breakfast and ate it at the view.  I had my stuff sprawled out on the view as other hikers walked by.  I got packed up and headed down the mountain.
On the way down I stopped at a water source to get an extra liter of water.  Spot stopped by and told me about camping at the spiritual life center.  It had camping in a large ball field and had a shower and outlets.  It was not too far ahead.  He always stayed there on his past thru hikes.  I trekked onto bear mountain.  On the way up I ran into Magic, Big Red, and Gazelle.  They were sitting on a fancy wooden bench admiring the view.  I hiked on with them up the rest of the mountain.  Bear mountain was covered with day hikers.  It's a place where a lot of New Yorkers go for the weekend.  It was the most people I had seen on the the trail.  At the top there was a large lookout tower but it was closed.  We hung out near the vending machines.  A guy showed up with sodas and candy.  Trail magic!  We all chugged a soda and got hyped on sugar.  We all headed down the mountain to the trailside museum and zoo.  On the way to the zoo we passed hundreds of people grilling and eating BBQ.  I now believe this is the hardest part of the trail.  No one was feeding us.  Luckily this time there was a concession stand and I got a Nathan's hot dog.  We hung on a bench near the water and watched people paddle boat across the lake.  I was getting excited for the pool and zoo.  
We headed for the zoo.  At the the entrance there was a large pool filled with tons of people.  They allowed thru hikers up swim for free!  They had signs on what you couldn't wear in the pool.  Underwear was one of them.  I decided to jump in with all my clothes.  At least they would be semi clean!  My first dip in was a cannon ball off diving board.  It felt so good after hiking in hot humid heat.  I imagined brown water coming off me but it didn't happen.  Gazelle and Magic were diving off the diving board.  Unfortunately flipping wasn't allowed.  I sat in the sun trying to dry out a little.  It didn't matter since it was so hot that my pants would eventually dry anyways.  We headed out from the pool and checked out the zoo.  The zoo featured animals and plant life that lived in the region.  The reptile exhibit was interesting since it described how rattlesnakes choose snake dens.  They usually had the same den for centuries.  There were also two black bears at the zoo.  Their cage was filled with turkey vultures.  The bears didn't seem to care about the birds.  I hiked out of the zoo.  At the exit there was a huge suspension bridge over the Hudson river.  It was built in 1924 and only took 20 months to complete.  On the other side was a steep 700 foot climb.  My motivation was an the Appalachian trail deli on the other side of the mountain.  When I got to the top I ran into Stealth and Truck at the top.  I thought Stealth was further ahead of me.  He ended up staying at a spiritual life center where they fed you dinner and breakfast.  He also managed to yogi some hamburgers at Tiorati lake yesterday which I couldn't manage.  We hiked onto the deli.  
At the Appalachian deli there were several packs there already.  Tree Beard, Bear Box, Toast, Magic, Big Red, Gazelle, Fetch, and F Word were there.  It was the place to be.  Inside I ordered a hero size chicken BLT sandwich.  Stealth decided to try four loco.  I told him it was the drink of choice for underage kids in college who wanted to get drunk really fast.  I ate at the picnic tables outside.  Cosmic walked up and bought two huge sandwiches.  She had been having a great 4 month trail anniversary today.  Stealth gave her a deep tissue back massage to make the day even better.  From the deli we headed over to The Graymoor Spiritual Life Center to camp.  It was a monastery that allowed hikers to camp for free.  It also had a Latin festival going on!  As Cosmic and I hiked over to the monastery's ball field we saw several people leaving.  The festival had ended. At the ball field there was still a few people packing up their food.  It all looked amazing and I wished I had gotten here earlier.  There were about 20 hikers at the ball field hanging out.  I setup my tent in the field.  Some hikers were playing baseball with an axe handle and a tennis ball.  They switched when someone found a football to throw.  Stealth started working on a new prayer flag.  He had materials to make about 30 of them.  Cosmic gave me some shampoo and I took a cold shower.  My body clenched up as the cold water hit my body.  It was still worth it.  Stealth told a few stories about the place he lived at in Hawaii. He told a story about a cow named Moony who gave birth to a cow coming out hooves first.  She was in labor all night.  Stealth had to help her by pulling the calf out of her body.  Tree Beard had been reading a single chapter of The Hobbit each night.  He didn't want to speak too loud since there were 20 people in camp.  People started cramming into his two person tent.  By the time I got to the tent 5 people were in there. Stealth and I crammed in.  We were all huddled together while Tree Beard read a chapter from the Hobbit.  He made different voices for each character.  Gandalf had a french accent.  Beorn was Scottish.  I tried to stay in the tent as long as I could but my legs started cramping up.  I walked back over to my tent and listened from there.  He finished up the chapter and I was finished for the night.

The beginning of until hike was pretty easy.  There were not many steep long climbs.  We all took a break by the river and talked about the prospect of swimming.  I snacked on a complete cookie.  I rolled out  following Bear Box with Stealth behind me.  All of a sudden I felt a sting then 2 at once.  I knew that I disturbed a bee hive.  I started flaying my arms in the air and running down the trail.  Bees were on my pack, shorts, socks, and shirt.  They really wanted to take me out.  I left my trekking pole on the trail.  I noticed about 5 bees on my crotch and shoved them off me.  Luckily they didn't sting through that area but they tried.  As I ran past Bear Box she started getting stung by bees and she ran up the trail.  When I stopped running I was stung at least 6 times.  Bear box was stung twice.  Stealth was behind me and saw the whole thing happen.  He grabbed my trekking pole and walked around the bee hive.  There were 20 bees angerly flying around.  At the top of the trail we waited to warn people about them.  French toast tried to get past them but was stung in the ankle and butt.  Another hiker named Butters came up the trail who couldn't really hear us.  He didn't seem to get stung but when he passed us he casually mentioned that he was stung.  From his composure you wouldn't think it.  French Toast gave me some sting aid to clean up my wounds.  They were burning on my back and legs.  I recovered for a bit then headed out.  Right up the trail was the remains of a farmhouse that was commissioned by George Washington for small pox inoculations.  There were cobble stone walls everywhere in the area.  After a few miles I found Stealth sitting on a large rock eating lunch.  I decided to stop there too and eat.  Soon everyone was stopping there for lunch.  Snags showed up too.  He had taken a break from the trail the other day when he was sweating buckets.  His legs were cramping up from such a large loss and had to take it easy.  He looked a lot better today.  I finished eating lunch and headed out. 
I put on the best hits of Creedence Clearwater Revival and cruzed down the trail.  The beat of CCR helped set a good pace.  I arrived at a road and saw a couple of hikers hanging out by a car.  I knew it was trail magic.  They had donuts and chips for us.  I gladly ate the extra calories and pushed onto Canopus lake.  There were signs saying that there was camping on the beach.  When I got to the beach it looked more like a swamp.  It wasn't that inviting.  Snags, Aladdin, and Pappa Bear were hanging out on a picnic table.  They had made it to the concession stand before the grill closed.  They were still open selling ice cream and snacks. Stealth and I went up there to buy ice cream and drinks.  We ran into HAM who had built a fire at the park's campsite.  I was excited about the fire since I hadn't had one since Maryland.  Snags, Aladdin, and Cosmic pushed onto the RPH shelter about 5 miles away.  You could apparently order Chinese food there.  Stealth and I were content with camping at the park tonight.  The campsite was a huge field with a fire pit and a large pile of wood for burning.  There was a pretty good fire going.  HAM had been carrying a hatchet with him and was chopping wood.  That was the heaviest luxury item I had seen on the trail.  They had taken a trip to NYC with it and had to hide it while on the train.  I setup camp and ate mashed potatoes with spam for dinner.  Stealth was working on a new prayer flag.  Pappa Bear showed us the laughing train video on YouTube and we were all soon laughing.  I walked about .3 miles back to the concession stand to use the shower.  It was a cold one but it felt nice to be clean before going to bed.  When I came back everyone was huddled around the fire.  Tree Beard busted out The Hobbit and read the next chapter in the story.  I could imagine the adventure in the book and how it related to being on the AT.  Instead of goblins, evil forests, and monsters to battle we had bears, ticks, giardia, and 4 lane highways to fight.  Everyone listened intently as we gazed into the fire watching cowboy TV.  Tree Beard finished the chapter and I was finished for the night.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599287,"My tent in the morning was soaking wet.  The dew in the field had gotten everyone's tent wet.  Pappa Bear was safe from the dew since he hammocked under the trees.  I set my stuff out to dry then ate breakfast.  Stealth was grinding beans and making coffee.  He shared a little with me and it was so good.  I chilled for a bit then headed out at 9 am.  There was a deli I was aiming for in 10 miles.  
In about 5 miles I arrived at the RPH shelter.  It was a large brick structure and had beautiful gardens out front.  Tree Beard found a can of spam and happily ate it as a snack.  I hiked onto the deli.  I ran into Bear Box and we talked about professions.  She had taught in Bariloche, Argentina.  I mentioned I had been there when I was living in Chile.  She had picked up the Argentinian accent.  We arrived at the deli. Pappa Bear and Train were already there eating.  I ordered a ruben and hung out back.  After I ate it I instantly got tired and laid on the ground to sleep it off.  When I awoke, everyone was talking about Double Stack's birthday.  He had rented an Airbnb to celebrate.  Kamikaze, Rebel Yell, and Growler were already there.  With only 10 miles into the day we decided to get an Uber over to the house.  I was looking forward to seeing them all again especially Theo.  It had been so long since I'd seen them.  We ordered 3 Ubers since there was 12 of us.  The first car only allowed 4 people.  The second car looked at the hikers and said they only had room for 2 people even though he was driving an SUV.  They didn't even come to a complete stop and left.  I ordered one and didn't have an issue with the driver.
When we arrived at the house Kazi was outside.  I gave her a hug and was really glad to see her again.  It had taken me a month to get within 15 miles of her.  She thought that she wouldn't see me again after Harper's Ferry.  I was being consistent with my miles and was able to catch up.  Theo was playing out back chasing tennis balls as Rebel Yell threw them.  There was 17 of us there for Double Stacks birthday.  He had a birthday cake yesterday and now a whole party.  He had truly double stacked his birthday.  We all crammed into the living room to take a photo doing Mouse King's pose.  We all layed on our sides with our arms propping up our heads.  Pappa Bear ordered pizza and we all destroyed that food.  Growler had cooked a set of ribs and they were so good.  With our bellies content Tree Beard read another chapter of The Hobbit.  I almost fell asleep as I listened.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599289,"I woke up on the living room floor.  It had been a cold night since the thermostat was set low.  Double Stack cooked up some bacon seasoned with brown sugar.  I also ate some more poptarts.   Kazi, Rebel Yell, and Double Stack were heading out and I said goodbye to everyone.  I hope to catch up with them soon on the trail.  We were planning on slack packing the 15 miles that we didn't do when we got an Uber from the deli yesterday.  I packed my bag with the bear essentials.  Food, water filter, first aid, and my poncho.  We tried getting an Uber but no one was picking us up.  We called a local taxi service and got a ride to the deli.  
When I arrived at the deli I saw a familiar face. It was Booger Bear!  I hadn't seen him in a couple months.  He had caught up with me during my nero week.  We were now at the same point.  He had been hanging out with a completely separate group of people.  Most of them I didn't know.  Booger Bear and I caught up from the last two months.  He was planning on hiking another 15 miles to Pawling, NY and that was my stop for the Airbnb.  I grabbed another sandwich and Booger Bear and I headed out.  The trail was relatively flat today.  There were a few little climbs but they were not that intense.  We came to a water source to grab more water and the sky opened up.  It poured for about 15 minutes.  I put on my poncho to save myself from being soaked.  The rain let up and the sun came out.  We arrived at Nuclear lake.  In the 50s and 60s it used to have a Nuclear research facility on it.  There was a chemical fire and an explosion which dusted the lake and the surrounding area with plutonium.  The EPA took over the area as a super fund site and cleaned up the mess.  Eventually the lake was deemed safe for public use.  Booger Bear and I took a swim in it.  It was the perfect temperature.  We didn't come out glowing or anything either.  I called Theresa and put her on speaker phone.  She was going to send a package to Booga with homemade cookies.  We talked a little about life in Austin and the people there.  Booga and I pushed on to route 22.  I invited him to stay at the Airbnb since the more the merrier.  
We got to the Airbnb around 8 pm.  I introduced Booga to everyone there since he hadn't met this bubble yet.  The bathroom was open and I took a quick shower to get off all the grime that had accumulated in the rain.  Pappa Bear came back from the grocery bearing food and beer.  He was a chef in his non trail life and cooked us a huge dish of spaghetti carbonara.  Stealth and Bear box put together a salad to go with it.  The food was amazing.  It was getting late and it was story time with Tree Beard.  We all piled into the bedroom to listen to the next chapter.  I was cuddled up on the bed with 4 other people.  Tree Beard finished reading and it was time for bed.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599291,"I awoke to Pappa Bear making biscuits and gravy for everyone.  It smelled amazing.  I still didn't want to get up though but coffee was calling me.  Everyone was eating breakfast and hanging out.  I drank a lot of coffee and ate biscuits and gravy.  I wish we could have more mornings like this.  Pappa Bear and Booger Bear were going to head into Pawling.  Booga was taking a zero day to use the library and hang out.  They got a taxi to town.  I said goodbye to Booga knowing that I would see him again soon.  I packed up my stuff then headed out around 9:20 am.  On my way to the trail I ran into Pappa Bear who had picked up his package drop.  He had a lot more food than he could carry.  I gladly took some food off of him.  Tree Beard and Pappa Bear had been playing Pokemon Go.  They walked in the opposite direction to go fight at a Pokemon gym.  I headed back on the trail.
There were bigger climbs than the ones yesterday.  I was looking forward to a corner store that was about .4 off the trail.  I hiked to the first shelter where F Word was already hanging out.  He made a sandwich with cheese, ham, and hard-boiled eggs.  The sandwich looked amazing.  I just had bread and peanut butter.  While we ate Tree Beard and Pappa Bear showed up.  We all ate lunch there and hung out for an hour.  I pushed on from there to the Connecticut border.  I waited for the crew so I could get a picture in front of the sign.  Tree Beard was thinking up different poses to take in front of the sign.  They were pretty ridiculous.  I laid on the ground and made the famous Mouse King pose.  We pushed on from there to the deli.  The road to the deli had an old covered bridge.  It looked like it was 100 or more years old.  When we arrived at the deli Stealth was already there. He had been hanging out for a few hours. He said the woman who ran the place was really friendly.  I walked in and bought a beer and a frozen curry dish.  The woman who ran the country store was Indian.  I talked about the time when I went to India.  I couldn't get enough of the curries.  I sat with everyone at the picnic tables outside.  It started pouring again.  Stealth and I stood on the picnic take under the umbrella to shelter from the rain.  The downpour only lasted for a few minutes then the sun came out again.  A mechanic from next door gave us a huge cookie that his daughter had made.  He couldn't eat the whole thing and we gladly ate it.  It was homemade and delicious.  Pappa Bear, Tree Beard, and French Toast headed out.  I hung out a little while later then headed for the Mt Algo shelter.
There were was a 700 foot climb then a trail of slanted slippery rocks.  It wasn't my favorite terrain.  I kept slipping sideways as I walked across the rocks.  I called my parents, my sister, Theresa, and my friend Tom to catch up with everyone.  It got darker and darker.  It became more difficult to see the rocks then I put on my headlamp.  I was about 2 miles from the shelter when I came to a steep downgrade with sharp boulders.  It was increasingly difficult to hike down in the dark.  Eventually I saw people's headlamps in the distance and knew I was at the shelter.  F Word and Silver Bullet were there.  Apparently Pappa Bear, Tree Beard, and French Toast camped a few miles back.  I setup my tent and cooked mashed potatoes for dinner.  It was time for bed.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599293,"Last night rain hit my tent pretty hard.  I thought some trees were going to collapse.  My rain fly was also leaking and I needed to repair it soon before more rain hits.   I didn't sleep that well since my right foot had been hurting.  It felt like tendon pain but I hope it isn't a stress fracture.  That would take me off trail.  I tried to get some sleep in the early morning but it was no use.  Even if I had to get off trail I feel that I got what I needed.  For me it's about the journey not the goal.  I woke up at 6 am and worked on a few journal entries. I didn't pack up until 9 am.  I met a hiker named Shepherd who had been interviewing people on the trail.  He was collecting data for a book about what a thru hike is like.  The book would explain the community around a thru hike.  Shepherd was also traveling with a large white dog named Ghost.  The dog had pulled Shepherd off the trail numerous times chasing wildlife.  Shepherd was injured a few times when this happened.  I eventually left the shelter at 10 am and headed into Kent, CT.
French Toast was at the access road to Kent.  Trish was getting dropped off from a hostel.  Her driver was able to give us a ride into town.  We went to the coffee shop to hang out.  French Toast was from Michigan and we talked about the upper peninsula.  I'd would love to see that part of the state.  After coffee we walked over to the post office and the grocery store.  We ran into Tree Beard and Pappa Bear playing Pokemon Go.  They were heading over to the visitors center that catered to hikers.  I got food at the IGA then headed over to the hardware store to get fuel.  They had tools I could borrow to fix my pack.  I cut off the old ladder locks on my shoulder straps and replaced them.  They had been slipping for awhile now.  
At the visitors center all the hikers were hanging out.  Charlie was cooking up some bacon in his skillet.  He would pack out bags of cooked bacon and sausage.  He offered me a beer and I gladly accepted.  Everyone was also drying out their stuff in the front lawn.  It looked like a hiker yard sale.  I broke down my food and packed my bag.  I headed over to shoe store.  I was looking to get new shoes since my Chacos had been slipping a lot.  I also wanted to have more protection for my feet.  At the shoe store they had one pair of Merrell moabs in size 15.  I knew those would work.  I headed over to the post office to grab my box with my foot inserts and my Ultras.  The Ultras I'll be returning to REI after the end of this trip since they tore my toes up.  I headed back over to the shoe store and got the Merrells.  I then headed to the outfitters which was in an ice cream shop and bought seam sealer for my rain fly.  I went back over to the visitors center and setup my rain fly inside out.  I applied a thin coat of sealant to all the seams.  As I was finishing up I saw huge rain clouds in the distance coming our way.  I moved the tent under the awning before it came down.  About 7 of us were hunkered under the awning as the rain hit.  Silver bullet was sitting under my rain fly.  The rain started going sideways under the awning.  It was pretty intense.  I made my way to the post office in the rain to bounce my old shoes forward to the next town.  When the rain died down mostly everyone headed to the next shelter about 7 miles away.  I stayed behind to wait for the seams to dry.
A girl named Toast and Easy Win were still at the visitors center.  We were trying to figure out if we should get back on trail and camp close to the road.  With all this rain most spots would mostly be muddy.  Easy Win talked to a bartender earlier on and mentioned there was a pavilion down the road where no one would bother us.  That seemed like the perfect place to camp for the night.  I ordered Chinese from the local restaurant and brought it back to the visitors center.  As we were hanging out we heard someone in a car yell ""hikers""!  There were three guys in a car who stopped in the parking lot next to us.  They asked us if we wanted a drink and we said of course!  The driver had a large bottle of vodka in his lap.  He may have been a little intoxicated as well.  The trio had been slacking sections of the trail with the car.  They were really excited to do specific areas.  They let us take a few swigs of vodka from the bottle and then they headed out.  I packed up my rain fly and headed over to the pavilion.  It was a little bit out of town but there was a large pavilion with a few picnic tables.  It even had an outlet.  I setup my tent quickly because the mosquitos were starting to attack.  Easy Win rolled in with a hamburger.  He setup his tent outside the pavilion since it wasn't free standing.  A motion sensor light turned on.  Luckily no one was in the house in front of us.  I quickly turned in for the night.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599572,"It rained all night.  Luckily I was under the pavilion where my tent stayed dry.  No one showed up to bother us either.  I woke up around 6 am and didn't really want to get up.  It was still raining and wasn't supposed to stop until 9 am.  Easy Win got up early to tear down his tent.  It got soaked last night.  I made a bagel with ham and cheese for breakfast.  Easy Win talked about all the Greatful Dead concerts he went to back in the day.  I tried to finish writing in my journal but I was distracted by Easy Win constant need to talk.  The rain eventually turned to a sprinkle and I headed out towards the trail.  On the way out of town I stopped by Annie Bananie for coffee and a blueberry muffin.  I updated my journal online then walked back to the trail about .8 down the road.  No one wanted to give me a lift back. :(
The trail today was going to be a whole bunch of ups and downs followed by a 5 mile river walk then more steep ups and downs.  I walked about 4 miles and ran into Charlie, Rolly, HAM, and F word playing hackie sack near their campsite.  It was noon and they were also having a late day.  I kicked the sack with them for a bit then headed back up mountain.  In one area was a steep descent with slick boulders.  It was hard to keep on my feet.  It felt like I was going to fall forward and smash my face in.  Fortunately I didn't have any bad falls.  We ran into 3 socks who was chilling at a view.  She said someone yesterday broke their arm on the same rocks yesterday.  I wish they would add more switchbacks in Connecticut.  The land flattened out into a 5 mile river walk.  I hiked next to French Toast.  We talked about our careers and what we would be doing after the trail.  French Toast was thinking about teaching English abroad and I told her about my teaching experience in Chile.  She wasn't sure if she was going to pull the trigger on it though.  At the end of the river walk was another 8 miles to the Pine Swamp Shelter.  I was planning on pushing there so I would have an easier hike to Salisbury, CT tomorrow.  I pushed past everyone onto the shelter.
The climbs today got me sweating pretty hard.  It seemed that they went straight up the mountain.  I would be dripping sweat at the top.  There was a river walk where you couldn't keep your shoes dry.  I changed into my camp shoes and waded through the rapids.  I made sure to put my phone and camera in a ziplock bag in case I fell.  I made it to the other side with my camp shoes only getting wet.  I pushed onto the shelter.  The terrain got softer with all the pine tree forests.  There were still boulders to climb though.  When I arrived at the shelter Butters and Too Sweet were already there. They were finishing up eating.  I setup my tent, got water, and ate more bagels with ham and cheese.  After one and a half sandwiches it was time to call it a night.

There were a few climbs from the shelter but then it soon flattened out into the Housatonic river valley.  Butters and Too Sweet caught up with me.  Too Sweet asked me about the name Bagel + Biscuit.  She was planning on opening a small breakfast place in her home town.  She had a degree in accounting and could handle all the finances.  We came to an area with a hydroelectric plant and a small building with a cold shower.  I headed over to the building and took a shower in my hiking clothes.  The cold water felt great as I cleaned up.  Other hikers came over to use the shower.  I walked over the iron bridge to the park on the other side with picnic tables.  I started cooking macaroni and cheese.  A guy came over and asked me how far I'd been hiking.  He had done some trail maintenance on the AT.  He asked me if I wanted anything.  I mentioned a soda would be nice.  I finished cooking my Mac and cheese and headed over to the other table.  The group of people were from Ecuador.  They were surprised to hear that I had been hiking for 4 months from Georgia. They asked me how I got food and how I didn't get lost in the forest.  I spoke a little Spanish with them since some didn't speak English.  They gave me a turkey sandwich and some ice cream.  They headed over to the water fall and I said goodbye.  I packed up and headed out.
On the way out I ran into a huge waterfall which Falls Village is known for. There were many people swimming in the area.  It looked refreshing but I decided to push on to pick up a package in Salisbury, CT.  I hiked up a large mountain.  Sweat was dripping off my elbows in the heat of the day.  I arrived at the summit and ran into Tree Beard.  He was laying against a tree relaxing.  We headed down the amountain.  At the bottom I ran into Pretzel who I hadn't seen since Devil's Backbone Brewery.  We pushed onto Salisbury.  In a field of ferns I felt a hot sting in the back of my leg.  I didn't see what bit me.  A hiker said he saw a wasp nest in the area.  It must had been that.  We passed the 1500 mile mark.  We were over two thirds done.  I went into Salisbury to pick up my package drop.  Theresa had sent me homemade cookies.  There were trail mix, Mexican cake, and a cookie bar.  The cookie bar was amazing as well as all the other cookies.  I ate the turkey sandwich from earlier then headed back to the trail.
It was another 4 miles until the shelter.  On the way I ran into Butters and Too Sweet.  They were making dinner before they camped.  I went a little further and saw Silver Bullet who hung out at the falls for most of the day swimming.  I pushed on over the next mountain.  It was steep and got my heart racing.  At the top there were hundreds of dragon flies.  They were buzzing around my head.  I made it to the shelter around 8:30 pm.  Everyone was cooking up food.  Right in front of the shelter was a view of the valley below.  Not many shelters have views but this one was amazing.  I sat down to make mashed potatoes for dinner.  The mosquitos were making a feast of our bodies as we ate.  I thought about sleeping in the shelter but with this many mosquitos I setup my tent instead.  Tree Beard read the next chapter of The Hobbit in the shelter.  He made a deep ominous voice for Smaug the dragon as Bilbo entered his domain.  He finished reading and it was time for bed.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600381,"I woke up around 5:30 am to watch the sunrise.  I walked back to the shelter and most people were awake already overlooking the the valley.  It was cloud covered and you couldn't see the valley.  We waited until 5:52 am then the sun rose over the mountain.  In the distance the clouds were burning bright orange.  I made sure to play the lion king's circle of life song.  I ate some poptarts and a hiker made me some coffee.  I was ready to start this day.  I had 17 miles to hike before 5 pm to make it to the community center in Great Barrington.  They will be serving free dinner!
I started hiking from Riga Shelter at 7:30 am.  I ran into Butters and Too Sweet on the way.  We climbed up bear mountain.  It was a hard steep climb.  At the top we had some pretty amazing views.  The problem was the way down.  It was steep slanted rocks with roots.  It felt like I could easily fall face first into a boulder.  A few times I had to get on my butt to make my way down.  At the bottom we were greeted with a stream with moss covered rocks and tall pine trees.  We were about to cross into Massachusetts and it felt different.  At the border I tripped and had a yard sale of all the stuff in my pockets.  Butters was watching me as I did it.  I scraped a few spots on my leg but got up and kept going.      The next climb was Mt Race that had a half mile ridgeline walk with a view of the valley.  The rocks were taking a toll on my feet.  I stopped for a little bit to eat snacks, but I wasn't planning to break much on my way to town.  The next climb was Mt Everett which was steeper than the last climbs.  They had built small steps into the rock so you could make your way up. I was getting mad at the trail at this point.  It was going to make me miss free dinner if the climbs kept this up.  I blasted some punk music which helped me get up the mountain.  I hiked down the mountain and ran into Pocket Fire who I hadn't seen in a long time.  He was traveling with his buddy Stitch.  We went down a large rock wall then it came to a long flat swamp. There was a ton of mosquitoes and I was feast for them.  I was doing about about 4 miles per hour into great Berrington. When I got to the access road to the great Berrington Butters and Too Sweet we're already there. They have gotten a ride from a local farmer into town but unfortunately he did enough room for me. I stuck out my thumb and got a ride to Great Berrington pretty fast.  The woman who picked me up was a section hiker and had hikedThe Long Trail. She was interested in where I was coming from and how long I've been on the trail.  
When I got to the community center there was already a whole bunch of hikers hanging out under the pavilion. Then I went inside the community center to use the restroom, showers, and pool. They had a therapy pool in the community center. When I got in the therapy pool Butters and Too Sweet also joined me. After 17 miles of straight up and downs my feet definitely needed it. A couple of southbound hikers joined us in the pool and soon had a little party going on in the therapy pool. They ended up putting on a fake aerobics class. They picked up picked up some weights and started dancing to some pop songs. After swimming they have the community feast which was a free meal from 5 to 6 on Mondays.  When I got to the area where they are eating there was a long line of people but the line went click quickly. The servers gave me chicken, kale, and rice. It tasted so amazing especially the kale since I've hadn't any greens for quite a while.  After dinner I set up my tent in the woods behind the community center. Apparently some people tried to camp in the field next to community center but they all got tickets on their tents saying they couldn't tent there.  The guy who was handing out the tickets would call the cops if they didn't move them. Up in the hills there was that many flat spots. I ended up having to move a whole bunch of pine needles to make a flat area. I stuffed clothes under my air mattress to make a level sleeping area.
I then headed to the McDonald's right next to the community center.  It was the hiker hangout. You could sit there for a few hours and see all your friends. I got a Big Mac meal and devoured it. Butters, Too Sweet, and I head over to the bowling alley.    The alley was really run down and it was only ran by one person named Brian. He ran the bowling alley, the Putt-Putt course, and the bar.  Booger Bear, Giggles, Rebel Yell, Growler, and a whole bunch of other hikers we're getting drinks at the bar.  I hadn't bowled in such a long time.  The lane was kind of run-down and it was difficult to get a decent throw because the floor was so sticky.  We played a few games and then hung out at the bar. Sparrow, Reggie, and Growler were buying shots by the end of the night.  We ended up draining three bottles of liquor.  Since Brian was the only one running the show we basically had free reign of the place.  Sparrow, Reggie, and I snuck to the back of the bowling alley where we could see the machines setting up the pins.  I've never seen the machines that did this before.   The Putt-Putt course had a whole bunch of random statues of dinosaurs. It had a giant dragon on the second floor and we all got a picture of us riding it. You're probably not supposed to climb it but with Brian only running the bar we could do whatever we wanted.  The hour passed 12:30 am and it was time to head back home. I walked with Silver Bullet, Growler, and Rebel Yell all the way back to community center. On the way back Growler, Rebel Yell, and a few other people disappeared.  I came to find out that they hung out at the hotel pool skinny dipping and playing Marco Polo.  I made it back to my tent try to level out my air mattress a little bit more and went to sleep.

I went over to the Price Chopper to resupply. I felt like I end up buying too much food for 50 miles into Dalton. We walked across the street from McDonald's stuck out or thumbs. A woman driving a large Nissan SUV picked us up. She was planning on going to work out at the community center with her husband but decided to take us to the trailhead. When we got dropped off I saw Silver Bullet and Tree Beard. They had gotten off a bit earlier and finally hiked up to the same spot that we were. We all headed out together. 
The climbs were a little bit steep and I was kind of out of breath.  I didn't have much energy since it was so hot.  I was trying to make it to the shelter about 3 miles away because a thunderstorm was heading in. I saw Bob hiking behind me and we're all racing to try to get to the shelter at 5:30 pm.  We could hardly see since the clouds were so dark.  All of a sudden I heard a rumble in a distance and knew it was rain. The rain instantly dumped down on us. Everything that I had dry basically got soaked.  I had about one more mile before the shelter. When I got there Growler, Double, Stack, Booger Bear, and Giggles were there. Booger Bear decide to stay to keep his feet dry because he didn't want to get any more blisters from wet feet.  Lupine, Zack, and I push on another four miles to Bear Town Campground. We heard yelling in the distance as we walked up to the campsite. We got to the lake and everyone was swimming. There is a pile of beer cans right next to the lake.  I jumped into the lake and I instantly felt good because it got me away from all the mosquitoes. Sunny pretended to be a shark and was attacking people underneath the water. I eventually got out and it was a bit freezing.  I put my t-shirt back on and felt a little bit warmer.   I slammed down two sandwiches that Day Walker and Pretzel provided and then headed to the campsite to set up.  When I got there Lupin and Zack and birthday boy we're already cooking dinner. They were making couscous with vegetables. It was way healthier than any meal I had in awhile. I set up my tent in the grass and headed over the fire that Day Walker made. Pappa Bear, Pretzel, Sunny, and Mouse King were already hanging out there. We reminisced about times on the trail. The hour passed and I decided to go to bed.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600385,"I woke up a little slanted in the tent but I slept ok.  I usually don't sleep well when I'm a little bit slanted.  Lupine and Birthday Boy got up a little bit early.  I made a groan because I really didn't feel like getting up. Lupine luckily made her cowgirl coffee.  It woke me up pretty well. I also ate 4 poptarts for breakfast.  Day Walker had practiced midevil sword fighting.  He had two shields and two swords.  Tree Beard and Sunny side had a duel with the weapons.  It was ridiculous to watch them both fight.  After their battle I was ready to head out.  It was going to be a 17 mile day up upper goose pound shelter.  I heard that several tramilies were going to be there.
I got on the trail around 8:30 am with Lupine and Birthday Boy.  The trail was wet from rain the day before.  Luckily the sun was coming out.  I was moving along the trail and met Griz moving pretty slowly.  He had taken a large fall earlier and had hurt his leg.  He was moving pretty slowly.  I pushed on to an open field.  I opened my pack and spread all my stuff around to let it dry in the field.  It was a large hiker garage sale.  I really wanted my shoes to dry out since they were still pretty wet from the day before.  I made a bagel with ham and cheese while waiting for my things to dry.  Rebel Yell, Growler, and Double Stack passed me as I ate.  After my stuff dried, I packed up and headed out.  I met Lupine and Birthday Boy drying out stuff on Cobble Hill.  They told me that the next road access had a fruit stand stall with drinks.  It was pretty hot and I was excited about the prospect of having a soda.  When I got there Pappa Bear told me the bad news that there wasn't any soda left.  I went to the house that had the stall and knocked on the door.  I heard a dog barking inside but no one came to the door.  I walked back to the picnic table and hung out.  About 5 minutes later a woman came out and refilled the fridge with soda.  I was really happy.  The soda was warm but I still drank it down.  I pushed onto upper goose pound.
There was an 800 foot climb.  I got to the top and had to put some leukotape on my back since my pack was digging into my skin.  From there it was pretty flat.  I heard thunder in the distance and knew it was going to rain.  I got a little further and it started pouring.  My dry shoes were once again wet.  The trail had huge lakes of water.  I started walking straight through them since there wasn't a point to walk around them anymore.  I listened to CCR as I was pushing through large streams that seemed to cover the whole trail.  Singing the lyrics gave me energy and I moved faster across the trail.  The rain subsided and I came to the outer edge of goose pond.  The sun came out again and the trees reflected in the water.  I took the side trail to the shelter.  
When I arrived, I heard laughing out front.  The shelter was a two story building with bunks upstairs.  The place was already filled up.  Cosmic, Blaze, Santa, Double Stack, Growler, and Rebel Yell were already there.  Santa told me that Scissors and Kamikaze were already there too.  I couldn't find them at the shelter and went to the beach.  Out on the lake was a small island.  I could see a few people on the island but couldn't make out their faces.  The canoes were gone but I found a life jacket and put it on.  I jumped in the lake and made the .3 mile swim to the island.  The water was pretty warm and still with only my body making motion in the water.  The life jacket allowed me to take breaks as I swam to the island.  Double Stack came out on a canoe and offered to pick me up.  I told him that I wanted to keep swimming to the island.   As I got closer I could see a few people swimming out front.  It was Blaze and Scissors.  I yelled out to Scissors ""You sure make it hard to catch up to you!"". Scissors was really surprised to see me.  We gave each other a huge hug in the lake.  I was really happy to have caught up with her.  We climbed up rocks on the island.  We watched as several other hikers started swimming out to the island.  Their heads bobbed up and down as they made the swim to the island.  About 20 of us were hanging out on the island.  We were like hiker seals sitting on the rocks making lots of noise.  Rosie and Cosmic showed up in a canoe to shuttle people back to the shore.  I swam all the way back.  
I was really hungry when I got back to shore.  I headed to the back of the shelter and found Rosie, Lupine, Booga Bear, Giggles, and Double Stack making dinner.  Most of us were making Mac N Cheese.  I gave Double Stack a whole bunch of Cheese Its for his meal.  I made taco Mac N Cheese.  We hung out for awhile and eventually called it a night.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600388,"It rained hard last night.  Luckily I stayed dry as it came down.  Rosie got a bit wet in his bivy sack and tarp combo.  A puddle got him in the middle of the night.  The bunkhouse in the morning smelled like pancakes.  The caretaker was cooking breakfast for everyone.  I got in line and had two pancakes with coffee.  It was amazing to get food like this at a shelter.  Coffee was the hardest resource to get.  Everytime the percolator would finish, it would be gone in seconds.  I had to wait in the kitchen to make sure I had a cup.  With 50 people staying in the area it was hard to keep up with the demand.  Tree Beard, Pappa Bear, Silver Bullet, and Mouse King Decided to take a zero at upper goose pond.  Scissors and Kamikaze decided to head out and so did I.  I packed my stuff and hiked out of upper goose pond.  I hope I can go back there someday.  I met Kazi and Scissors  about two miles down the trail.  They were picking up a supply package from Theresa.  She had sent them homemade cookies, dinners, snacks, and letters.  They both said I was lucky to have Theresa.  
We got back on the trail.  It was flat but a  mud mess with streams all over the trail.  It was difficult to keep your feet dry.  After about 8 miles we took an early lunch near a beaver bog.  We tried dying off our socks but it was no use since the sun could only come partially through.  Kazi ate the curry meals that Theresa sent.  Scissors hydrated one of the dinners in her Talenti jar.  After lunch we ran into an 85 year old named Moose Burger who was section hiking the trail.  He told us a story about his hike in Maine where it rained for 14 days straight.  He said his feet looked funny after being wet for so many days.  We hiked onto the next road access where the cookie lady lived.  Out front there was an older man who was hard of hearing.  He said to knock on the door out back.  We did but no one answered.  The side of the house had large blueberry bushes.  Kazi, Scissors,  Scatter, and I went over and started devouring blueberries.  We sat on the picnic table and ate some of our snacks.  The older gentleman who I assumed was the husband of the cookie lady came over with a basket of cookies.  They were peanut butter with m&ms.  They were really good.  I told him I was from Ohio and he told me about a John Denver song about that state.  The cookie lady came out from the house.  She had a list of states and countries with check marks next to them.  I checked off Ohio which there were already a whole bunch.  Scissors, Scatter, and I decided to head out.  Kazi stayed behind to eat blueberries and more blueberries.  Our goal was to hike another 4 miles.
During the hike the sun set and it was dark in the forest.  Scissors had forgotten her headlamp at upper goose pond.  She walked between Scatter and I for light but eventually opted for her phone's light.  We stopped on top of a hill that didn't have any stealth sites and decided to make our own.  Right next to the trail was a bed of ferns.  I put my tent on them and the ground was really soft.  I ate a bagel with cheese and meat.  Scissors had a whole bunch of bugs in her tent.  She was deciding which bugs lived and which ones died.  The cute ones only survived.

We got into Dalton and ran by Tom's house.  He's a local in town who hosts hikers in his backyard.  Sonny was there.  He had injured his eye with his tent pole.  His eye was all bloodshot but he didn't want to go to the doctor.  Scissors and I went to the Cumberland Farms gas station.  It had 99 cent hot dogs with a load of fixings.  Scissors got 3 and devoured them.  I saw Snags there.  He was also getting hot dogs.  We ran into Rebel Yell and he said he tried going to the laundromat 3 times but it wasn't open.  The owner opened it whenever he felt like it.  I really wanted to wash my socks though.  Scissors bought some dawn soap and we decided to wash our stuff at the community center.  We first went to Juice and Java to get coffee.  Kamikaze came in and said she was going to a bar named Paddy's for a drink.  Scissors and I went to the community center and took showers.  I washed my socks in the shower.  There was a sauna and I tried drying them out in there but it was no use.  I met a Sobo in the locker room and asked him about the upcoming terrain.  He said Vermont was mud and New Hampshire and southern Maine had really difficult terrain.  In the whites you have to pay for camping at most of the campsites.  That area is part of the Appalachian Money Collectors (AMC).  Scissors and I packed up our things and headed back on the trail.
Theresa was at the Richmond airport waiting for her flight.  I called her and put her on speaker phone with Scissors and I.  Scissors thanked her for the resupply package she had sent.  We told Theresa about our reunion at upper goose pond.  Scissors ran into a Sobo who she knew through co-workers when she lived in Steamboat Springs.  They caught up for a bit while the mosquitos attacked us.  We pushed onto Cheshire.  Our motivation was a Dunkin Donuts in town.  We hiked on into the night.  Right before town we saw a grouping of sticks in an odd formation.  It wasn't natural and reminded me of the Blair Witch Project.  With our senses on full alert we rolled into Cheshire.  A few of the houses we walked past had fires burning in the backyard.  We wished someone would invite us in but it didn't happen.  We walked to the church that allowed you to camp in their yard.  We setup camp and planned on hitting up Dunkin about .6 away.  Onyx and Butcher showed up.  They had just come from the bar.  Scissors and I went to Dunkin and ordered enough food for dinner and breakfast the next day.  We ate our sandwiches and headed back to the church to pass out.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600771,"At midnight eerie clown music played from across the road.  It was so loud that it woke us up.  After the music an animal started making screeching noises.  It was a loud night.  In the morning Scissors and I ate our Dunkin Donuts food.  We pushed out of town to start the climb up to Mt Greylock.  
The big climb of the day was 2800 feet.  On the way up I got a message from Rosie saying he was in the next shelter.   Scissors and I decided to visit that shelter and take a break from the drizzle.  Rosie was still sleeping in the shelter when I arrived.  He looked pretty cold and was tired.  I made some black cherry tea for Scissors and Rosie.  It felt good to have a hot drink when the weather was getting colder.  It started raining harder and harder.  We decide to hang out there for awhile to wait out the rain.  I didn't want wet shoes again. Rosie said Lupine was going to take off a few days to allow her feet to heal.  She was going to Maine to go to the doctors to get them checked out.  Rosie said he was going to wait for her to get back on the trail.  He had a friend in Connecticut that he might crash with for the next few days.  Scissors and I stayed there for 3 hours waiting for the rain to stop.  
We left when it was still sprinkling.  I had put plastic bags around my socks too keep them dry.  Everyone thought I was crazy for doing it.  Back on the trail it was mud and water city.  It was hard not to put your foot in a lake of water on the trail.  Luckily there were a lot of rocks to jump onto.  My shoes got soaked but my feet were dry.  I came to the access road to the top of My Greylock.  It was already foggy and damp.  There was a lodge at the top. I was looking forward to for food.  I found Scissors at the lodge with the saddest face.  They had closed the lodge for a private event.  I bet they were hoping for good weather too.  A family offered to drive us off the mountain to get something to eat.  They probably thought we were starving the way we were acting.  We declined their kindness and moved to the war monument tower.  On clear days the tower had a beautiful glass light at the top.  It was so foggy that we could hardly see the tower from 50 feet away.  It materialized from the fog like some long forgotten structure.  You could climb up the tower and look out over the valley.  We didn't see anything.  The inside of the tower was warm so we decided to eat some snacks and hang out.  We told people that there wasn't a view as they climbed the stairs to the top.  We packed up and headed out.
On the way down from the tower we ran into the shelter that could only be used in emergencies.  It was filled with Sobos staying for the night.  We pushed on another 3 miles to the next shelter.  The trail was the same as it was when we climbed it.  We got to the shelter and there was an older man making food with two other hikers in the shelter.  I put my pack down inside the shelter to keep it dry.  The younger guy in the shelter told me to move it away from his stuff.  He had just gotten water and I asked him where the water source was.  He said just follow the blue blazes like every other shelter.  Scissors asked him what his problem was since he was being really rude. He said he didn't appreciate people walking in being loud and noisy.  It was 7 pm and we were just talking.  We didn't understand what made him so mad.  Magic and Big Red showed up and could feel the awkwardness.  We all ended up setting up our tents in the rain instead of staying in the shelter.  This guy is going to have a hard time on the trail since people always congregate at the shelters.  I setup my tent for the first time on a wooden platform and had to figure out how to tighten down the rain fly.  The bottom of my tent was already wet from the wet wood slats.  I got the rest of my stuff together and made dinner at the shelter.  Onyx and Butcher were there making dinner as well.  They were going to stay in the shelter.  We had a whole conversation about dehydrated food and alcohol stoves.  The guy in the shelter didn't say anything.  Probably because he saw that Onyx was a huge guy and didn't want to mess with him.  I finished my dinner and headed back to the tent.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600772,"It rained hard last night.  So hard that rain splashed off the wooden boards and onto the tent's bathtub.  The bathtub got wet then the water seeped through.  My sleeping bag got a little wet from the side walls.  I should have put leaves around the awning to keep the splashback down.  In the morning I got ready and ate some trail mix for breakfast. We were going to town in 3 miles and were going to eat there.  Scissors and I got our stuff ready and talked to Magic and Big Red for a bit.  They had stayed with a woman who Magic met in the airport on his way to the trail.  She had given him his trail name.  She cooked him a huge homemade meal and let them sleep at her house.  I bet it felt amazing after all these days of rain.  Scissors and I  packed up and headed down the mountain to Williamstown.  On the way down we talked about minimalism and how great it felt to have less stuff.  Scissors told about when she was 19 and her roommate accidentally burned down the apartment.  Scissors lost everything.  Instead of feeling sad she felt more liberated with less stuff.  I told her Theresa and I were using the Konmari method to tidy up our house.  It's a practice were you only surround yourself with things you love.  It helped us get rid of so much stuff.  
We got to the access road to Williamstown and stuck out our thumbs.  Within 5 minutes we had a ride to The Clark.  It was Scissors' favorite art museum.  The person asked us where we wanted to go.  We said the Clark.  He asked you sure you don't want to go to the Mass MOCA?  Scissors said no because she liked the Clark more. The person who gave us a ride was the art director of the Mass MOCA.  He told us about some areas to explore in Williamstown.  We thanked him for the ride to the Clark.  We got out and met group of employees getting surveys for the art museum.  They told us about where we could check our bags.  One guy was really interested in hiking the trail.  We gave him the low down on it.  I used the bathroom there to take the plastic bags off my feet so I didn't look so trashy.  It destroyed that clean bathroom floor.  We walked into the front entrance and the guy taking the surveys gave us free admission into the museum!  We went in and first went to the food court.  We were starving.  They had pozole and we each got bowls. It was amazing after all the junk food we had been eating.  The museum had a special exhibit with women artists in Paris.   We walked over to the permanent exhibit and saw Scissors' favorite painting of nymphs trying to push a half human half goat into a lake. A museum worker said that the nymph painting was one of Mr. Clark's favorite.  He had seen it as a teenager and found it later in life and bought it.  In his old age he used to be wheeled by it and he would pat the one nymph on the butt.  We looked at a few other paintings before heading to downtown Williamstown.  We went to The Purple Pub and got salads for lunch.  Afterwards we found a small park in the middle of the shops and had a hiker garage sale to dry out all our stuff.  People walked by and just stared at us as we laid everything out.  We dried out or stuff then got a hitch back to the trail.
At the trailhead we ran into Tree Beard and Silver Bullet who were taking a break.  We were about 4 miles from the Vermont state line.  We pushed on uphill to the border.  When we got to the famous long trail sign Sunny, Mouse King, and Pappa Bear were already there.   We got a few group shots around the sign.  Scissors jumped on my back and we got a stacked person shot.  I didn't want my picture in front of the sign but got it from the back instead.  We all pushed onto the shelter.  As soon as we crossed the border the trail turned into thick mud.  In some places it was so deep that it came up to your knee.  I tried rock hopping around it but sometimes my foot slipped into it.  It made me hike slower too.   Night fell and I put on my headlamp.  My batteries slowly died and I used my cell phone for light.  I slipped on a root and fell  on my butt.  I was ok though.  We all pushed onto the shelter.  It was jam packed with people and tents.  The NOBO and SOBO bubbles were colliding.  I found a flat spot and setup my tent next to Sunny, Scissors, and Bullet.  I made a vegetable bark dinner and called it a night.

The trail continued to be a mud mess today.  I talked to some SOBOs and they said the mud lasts 80 miles.  I hope it does stop after that.  My shoes were slowly getting caked in more and more mud.  They started to weigh 3 pounds each with all the extra mud.  Scissors and I had plans to go into Bennington, VT to do laundry and resupply.  We slowly got the rest of the crew to go into town too.  We told everyone there was a Taco Bell in town and that was enough to convince everyone to go.  Tree Beard wanted to push for extra miles today but it didn't seem like that was happening.  The descent to the road was really steep and the rocks were wet.  We saw a shuttle pull into the parking lot and tried to run down faster.  Luckily Scatter was ahead of us and was able to talk to them.  Unfortunately, they were going the wrong way.  
A guy on the trail gave us rides to Taco Bell.  I got to Taco Bell and ordered a whole bunch of food.  We all sat around a round table and hung out for awhile.  It started raining outside and we decide on getting a motel.  I booked two rooms at the Knotty Pine Motel and we all walked over there.  We dropped off our packs then headed to Walmart to resupply.  I ended up buying way too much food but figured it might get me to Rutland, VT.  I brought all the food to the motel and broke it down.  We also did laundry at the motel which felt amazing after having muddy socks.  I took a shower and washed off days of mud.  I'm surprised we didn't clog the drain with all our  messy bodies.  We chilled in the room and watched Golden Girls into the night.

At the trailhead Butters and Too Sweet were taking a break.  I decided it was a good place to eat my salad and avocado before doing a large climb. I ate my food then headed up the mountain.  Tree Beard, Bullet, Sonny, and Mouse King talked to a woman who just hiked down from the other side.  Apparently at the last shelter a tree had fallen on three people who were hammocking.  The tree was alive but the ground was so saturated with rain that it couldn't hold itself up.  One woman was taken to the hospital for a fractured vertebrae in her neck.  I hope it does stop raining.  Out of the gap the climb was steep and with a full resupply it wasn't fun.  I kept hiking on though.  I didn't see Scissors or Kamikaze since they left a little earlier than me.  I ran into Tree Beard, Mouse King, and Silver Bullet at a water source hanging out.  They were taking an extended break.  I rolled out and had to fight the mud.  It seemed to go on forever.  It was hard not to get your shoes wet.  There was another climb to the Goddard shelter but I finally got there.
At the shelter Kamikaze, Scissors, and Scatter were already there making dinner.  I got water and washed off my legs.  I made a ramen bomb for dinner.  It was so much food and took awhile for me to eat it.  There was another guy from the Netherlands there named Yoni.  He had a super heavy pack but was only doing 8 mile days.  We all packed in the shelter to watch Jurrasic  Park 3.  It was around 8 pm but another guy told us that he couldn't sleep with it playing.  We turned it off then headed to bed.

The terrain wasn't that bad with elevation until the end of the day.  I hiked for awhile with Scissors and Kamikaze.  We hadn't hiked together in awhile.  They talked about me being a gallentine and not a bro. We hiked onto the shelter about 9 miles away for lunch. I made a sandwich with salami and cheese.  Everyone hung out there for awhile just trying to dry their feet out from all the mud.  Scissors and I were still planning on hiking another 11 miles to Stratton Pond Shelter.  Kamikaze and GG were planning on taking a blue blaze around Stratton mountain to the shelter.  Kazi was in survival mode.

The trail was mostly down hill all the way to town. There wasn't much climbing.  Scissors' dad was coming into town to pick us up from the gap.  I wanted to make sure I stayed with her.  I didn't see Scissors or Scatter for the whole hike.  When I got to the gap Scatter was getting into a hitch when he saw me.  He told the woman that he didn't need a ride after all. As we waited for Scissors, a couple cars rolled in with our friends.  It was Santa, Cosmic, Scooter, and Charlie.  We hung out talking going back to the real life.  Scissors showed and her dad Dwight rolled in.  They took Scatter, Scissors, and I to the local pizza place in town.  We got two large supreme pizzas and Scissors' dad paid for them!  It was amazing trail magic.  He asked us mostly about the tail and our experience on it.  Kazi showed up and got some free pizza as well.  We all headed to Starbucks to negate the affects of the pizza.  Scissors had to do laundry and I threw my socks in with her wash.  After coffee, Scatter and I went to the local outfitter.  They fixed the tip of my trekking pole for free!  It saved me about $20 if I had to buy new ones.  Dwight came and picked us up to take us back to the trail.
At the trail head Dwight had a whole bunch of dehydrated food that he shared with us.  I made my own veggie mix to add to my meals.  Dwight headed out and we hoofed it up the mountain.  It was a 3 mile climb to Bromley mountain.  I stopped at the shelter to grab 3 liters of water since there was none at the top of Bromley.  About .3 from the summit the trail opened up into a ski slope.  As I got to the top I noticed all my friends perched on a rock.  They were watching the sunset.  As I walked up the hill everyone applauded.  I took a bow.  I opened the large Busche Ice that Scatter gave me as the bottom.  The sky became dark and we could see the stars and milky way.  It's usually hard to see that when there's so much artificial light.  Everyone was staying in the warming hut.  I decided to pitch my tent since the warning hut sounded too warm.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600777,"Last night the moon went down and the milky way shown even brighter.  Then clouds rolled in and the sky couldn't be seen anymore.  I woke up to everyone eating breakfast on the ski lift.  I packed up my stuff and joined them.  The view of the valley was pretty clear this morning.  I made some coffee and ate a salami and cheese sandwich.   Scissors and I got pictures in the ski lift chair.  We headed out for a 17 mile day.
The descent off the mountain was wet but the trail was gradual.  We were going to the little rock pond shelter and it was mostly down hill.  I got to the Peru peak shelter and everyone was eating lunch there.  Cosmic and I talked about government jobs and how people seemed to never leave one since it had such good benefits.  It felt like people were trapped in those jobs because of the fear of leaving and not getting that job again.  As I was eating Booger Bear and Giggles showed up.   They got out of the rain and ate lunch.  Booger Bear was pushing for Rutland, VT to have WiFi for his fantasy football league.  I took off for the remaining 9.7 miles to the shelter.  I didn't see anyone except Kazi for the remaining of the hike until the shelter.  Everyone took a break earlier and I passed them all.  I had been listening to The Alchemist and had thought about my own personal legend.  I'm not sure if I've attained it yet but I'm on the right track.  
When Kazi and I arrived at the little rock pond shelter we met the caretaker there.  There was an overnight fee of $5 for each of us.  It was the first time I had to pay for a shelter.  The caretaker told us the fees were used for the caretaker program.  He also mentioned that he had to stir the privy.  It didn't sound like the best job in the world.   He kept talking as the rain started pouring on us.   I just wished he stopped talking sooner so we could get out of the rain.  We walked up to the shelter and Cosmic and Santa were already there.  I claimed a spot on the bunk.  Scatter and Scissors rolled in.  Soon the shelter was pretty full.  I made a ramen bomb for dinner and it took awhile for me to eat it.  It got late then Booger Bear and Giggles showed up.  There was only floor room in the shelter.  With the rain coming down so hard it was better than setting up a tent.  I shared my water with Booga since he didn't want to go out in the rain to get more.  They ate dinner and setup their pads on the floor.  Booga ended up sleeping under the picnic table.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600785,"Last night the rain came down hard.  A few people camped in the woods and one person's stuff got wet.  It was the kind of rain that would soak anyone's stuff if you didn't setup your tent right.  I woke up with my stuff dry.  Some people were getting ready at 6:30 am.  I decided to sleep in until 8 because it was still raining.  I never want to leave the shelter when it's still raining.  I eventually got up and packed my stuff.  I ate grits for breakfast but they were getting harder to put down.  Yoni had opened a can of tuna, put a piece of toilet paper on top of it, and lit it on fire.  The tuna oil burned causing the tuna to warm up.  I've never seen a can of tuna warmed up this way before.  I was the last one to leave and said goodbye to Yoni.  He would be studying in Vermont for the next 4 years.  He talked about hiking the long trail.  I said he needed a lighter pack than 60 pounds.  
The trail was a river.  The large rain from last night caused streams to flow over the trail.  It could have supported salmon swimming up stream with this much water.  I tried to keep my shoes dry but it was no use.  I was skipping on rocks but eventually I took the freedom step right into the water.    After that I was sloshing through puddles and mud.  My feet were soaked but I was moving faster.  I got a text from Scissors about meeting her Grandpa today and I was on board.  We were going to meet him at route 103.  Scissors originally said we would be there at 3:30 pm but that didn't seem doable with the amount of miles and terrain.  Scissors had gone .3 down the wrong trail.  It allowed me to catch up with her though.  We hiked through a really deep river that came up to my thighs.  I'm glad I didn't fall down.  We met up with Kazi and hiked together.  We had another 6 miles to go.  There were wet roots and steep slick rocks that I had to watch out for.  It was pretty easy to slip.  Right before route 103 we met some trail angels giving out food.  They gave me a hard boiled egg from their chickens and it tasted amazing.  
At the parking lot I met Scissors' grandpa.  He was in his 80s and still drove around.  He told us about the wet weather they had been having in Vermont.  I wished it would stop.  He drove us to Middlebury where he lived.  We went to the Thai restaurant in town.  I ordered Tom Kha and Kai Soi.  It all tasted amazing after our cold wet day.  After dinner we toured the town a little bit then Scissors' grandpa took us to the grocery store to resupply. I was going to make some omelettes for breakfast since it had been already awhile since I cooked.  Grandpa picked us all up and took us to his house.  
We laid our packs outside to keep the stench out.  I hung out on the lazy boy.  Grandpa talked about his time in the Korean war.  He didn't want more war and wanted peace.  Most veterans want that since they've seen war.  I washed our clothes before hitting the hay.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601380,"I woke up this morning well rested because I slept in a real bed.  I updated my online journal entries until 9 am.  Scissors and Kazi got up late too.  We were all comfortable at Grandpa's house.  I went into the kitchen and started making breakfast.  I roasted red potatoes with spices and made red pepper, spinach, and goat cheese omelettes.  It was a real breakfast.  We all sat at the dining room table.  Grandpa told us about the time when he owned a farm with animals.  He had a female cow that chased him through the field because she was in heat.  He had to run for his life.  Scissors talked about the time she was volunteering as a surgical tech in Nepal.  They would go to rural areas and preform routine check-ups on the people there.  After breakfast we packed all our stuff up.  Scissors' brother Allen came to take us back to the trail.  We hung out until 1 pm then said our goodbyes to grandpa.  
On the way back to the trail we stopped at the A&W to grab another bite to eat.  I slammed a hamburger and french fries. My stomach wasn't feeling a root beer float though. We headed back to the trail head.  Scissors and Kazi wanted to only hike 7 miles today so they decided jump ahead a little.  I still wanted to do the 4 mile section and got dropped off where grandpa picked us up.  At the parking lot, a family was interested in how far I had hiked.  They were surprised to hear that I had hiked from Georgia.  I put on my wet shoes from yesterday and got back on the trail.  Today I would be climbing Mt. Killington.
The first part of the trail hit me with a boulder climb.  I had a full resupply and hoofed up it.  A few miles down the trail I ran into Pappa Bear.  He was slack packing from Rutland.   I then ran into Rebel Yell, Scooter, Tree Beard, Mouse King, Sonny, and Bullet.  They were all slack packing South.  All of them were staying at the Yellow Deli in town.  Everytime I saw someone I stopped for a few minutes.  By the end I had used up 30 minutes talking to everyone.  I was trying to get to the summit of Killington before nightfall but it didn't seem like it was going to happen.  I started the 5 mile climb up Killington.  The bottom wasn't that bad but halfway up the trail became narrow with roots and rocks.  It was already dark and I was worried I was going to fall and stab myself on a root.  I made it up the climb and the trail evened out.  I called my sister on the top.  We had been playing phone tag for the last few days.  My cell phone service had been getting worse since going further north.  I made it to the shelter around 9:30 pm.  It was completely empty and dilapidated.  The sleeping surfaces were slanted and there was broken glass on the floor.  It seemed that people used it to party.  It was .2 from Killington lodge so that made sense.  The shelter felt haunted with wind creaking through the walls.  I ate my packed out salad and made some tea.  It's cold tonight on a 3900 foot mountain.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601391,"This morning I woke up in the creepy shelter with the light shining through the windows.  The shelter didn't look that bad when it was lit up.  I made steel cut oats for breakfast.  While eating a hiker named Breezy came in to use the table.  We talked about the trail in Vermont and joked about it's condition.  He said he was going to nero in town at the Yellow Deli.  It seemed like a lot of hikers were staying there.  After breakfast I made my way up to the summit of Killington.  I ran into Kazi and Scissors who had stayed up there overnight.  They had made it to the sunset but didn't bother waking up early for the sunrise.  I've seen the sunrise twice on this trip which is good enough.  The climb up was steep with boulders.  At the top Fish was hanging out.  It was cloudy but every so often the clouds would part and I could see the valley and mountains below.  It seemed like an endless expanse of ranges.  It felt like I was in real mountains again.  I stumbled back down to the shelter to hike out.  Kazi and Scissors were finishing up eating.  Today we would be meeting Kazi's friend Catherine who would be taking us to the Yellow Deli in Rutland.  
The descent off of Killington was not as bad as the climb up in the dark.  The mud was less and the roots didn't try to turtle me.  I ran into Rayrock and Stryder who I hadn't seen since Damascus.  They must had been taking it easy since they were about a week ahead of me the last time I saw them in the shelter logs.  I then ran into Sparrow and Blaze who told me that I would be staying at the Yellow Deli tonight.   The place was like a vortex for hikers.  I pushed on and eventually got to the gap.  Catherine was there waiting for Kazi, Scissors, and I.  Kazi and Catherine hugged for a awhile.  Kazi was really happy to see her.  She took us to the Yellow Deli to grab lunch.  I ordered a Deli Rose which was a roast beef sandwich with their in house baked bread.  It was the best sandwich I have had on the trail.  I was still hungry and got a tomato basil soup that was just as good.  Catherine and Kazi had been friends since 6th grade.  They talked about shenanigans back home.  Catherine worked for North Face and had a lot of free time on the job to hang out.  They had some girl talk which I couldn't partake in.   We decided to stay at the Yellow Deli hostel since it was so relaxing there.  Sometimes you just need to take a break.
At the hostel Ashe the hostel caretaker showed us around.  The dorms were split by male and female.  There was a common room to hang out with free juice and mate.  It had an open patio with fresh vegetables growing on it.  The hostel provided free breakfast for hikers.  Ashe said we could pick any vegetables on the patio to add to our breakfast.  In the men's dorm I found Scatter who had been staying since yesterday.   He was tweaking on coffee, mate, and the hostel's homemade energy bars.  It didn't look like he could keep still.   I hung out for awhile talking to other hikers who got vortexed into the Yellow Deli.  It seemed that most had stayed for a couple days.  Kazi instigated a bar outing.  Scooter, Scatter, Bob, Scissors, Kazi, and I went to the Saloon.  We played shuffleboard and drank a good amount of beer. I found out that Kazi had played shuffleboard back in Boulder.  She had the finesse to place the puck in the right spot.  She was the person you wanted on your team.  We were hungry and set out to search for food. The bartender told us about an Italian place down the street.  We walked over there but found the prices to be too high for hiker hunger.   We ended up finding a pizza joint and a bar called union jack's.  The bar allowed us to eat our pizza while we ordered $2 PBRs.  We stuffed our faces then headed back to the hostel before the 10 pm curfew.  The curfew was just for the front door.   We found several hikers in the common room.  Ashe brought leftover food from the Yellow Deli and everyone destroyed that food.  I only made it another 30 minutes before going to bed.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601392,"I didn't fall off the bunk last night.  Everyone was sleeping still when I got up.  I prepared my pack to slack pack today.  Scissors had setup a slack pack 20 miles ahead from Rutland, VT.  Yellow Deli provided free breakfast to hikers.  It was an egg scramble with veggies and faro rice.  We had coffee and mate.  It was so good.  Ashe asked if anyone wanted to go to the farm to volunteer.  Scissors and Kazi didn't feel like hiking today and got several other people at the table to go to the farm.  I decided to go as well since I wanted to see what the Yellow Deli cult was all about.  We cancelled our slack pack and got ready for the farm!  Woman had to wear a specific garb that included long loose pants and a blouse.  They looked like they were from the 1800s.  We all met downstairs where Ashe gave us free peach mate from the back.  We started feeling energized from the drink.  I don't know what that put in that stuff.  We walked out back and got on a short blue bus.  We took some peach mate to go.  
We only got 5 miles from the deli when we stopped for gas.  Ashe had to top off the oil in the bus since it was low.  We headed back on the road only to turn around 5 miles ahead since Ashe thought he put gas in the tank when he didn't.  By this time an hour had passed and the we started mate crashing.  We kept making jokes that the mate was taking our brains over.  Ashe switched driving with Lemanual who ran the farm.  We continued driving for another 45 minutes until we arrived at the farm.  Lemanual was in his 70s and had joined the community 30 years ago.  He was married before but got divorced when he joined the community.  He showed us around the farm and explained what was growing.  They tried to plant certain flowers and herbs that attracted good bugs.  We went to the barn to see the goats and cows.  After exploring the farm we sat down to eat lunch.  They served us goat's milk sweetened with chocolate and maple syrup and wraps with fresh vegetables.  We were spoiled with good food.  Lemanual talked about the religion and the different communities around the world.  They got olive oil from their community in Spain and mate from Brazil.  They got goods from communities all over the world.  Lemanual made a racist comment with the n word but referred to himself when using it.  Everyone got quiet and I thought about the racist grandpa.  We asked why he used that word but didn't really have an answer.  
After lunch we went to the fields to pull weeds from carrot plants.  Xaer was there help us out.  We asked him all sorts of questions about the religion.  They didn't allow homosexuals in the community.  They promoted childbirth over any other recreation.  Children were homeschooled and trained in their ways.  Sex was not seen as enjoyment but as a way to create offspring.  If they had a medical emergency they would go to the hospital.  They worked 6 days a week and had Sabbath on Saturdays.  When someone joined they would share their possessions with the community.  If someone was in debt they would pay it off when they joined.  We asked him questions until it was goat milking time.  The goats were bread to produce more milk then their offspring needed.  They would milk them everyday.  Scissors and Gigs had a hand at milking the goats.  They missed the bucket a few times.  After the milking it was time to go. We all got back on the bus and headed back to Rutland.  Lemanual changed drivers out of town with Ashe.  Ashe said we could all get free sandwiches for helping on the farm!  I was super excited for more tasty food.
Back at the Yellow Deli we all sat at a large round table and ordered our free sandwiches.  We played a phrase and picture telephone game that produced some pretty crude stories.  I got a ruben with a bowl of potato cheddar soup.  It was amazing.  After dinner I went to Walmart to pick up some supplies and a pomace stone to scrub my feet.  I went back to the hostel and took a shower.  I stayed up a little late to wait for my socks to dry.  At 11 pm it was time for bed.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601393,"I woke up a little late this morning but they were serving breakfast at 7:30 am.  I went downstairs to the deli to grab free grub.  It was an egg, potato, and cheese frittata with rice.  I ate most of it.  We were still talking about our weird experience at the farm.  Scatter and I wanted to catch the 9:15 am bus back to the trail.  We went upstairs and packed everything up. I didn't see Kazi nor Scissors before I left but figured I'd see them on the trail.  The bus station was behind the deli.  Scatter and I hopped on the bus and headed back to the trail.
The trail was just as we left it except it was raining today.  Past Rutland the mud had seemed to stop.  There was still muddy areas but less mud now.  I pushed 10 miles into the next shelter for lunch.  Gigs, Scooter, Scatter, Forgiven, and Sunshine were there.  I made a bagel sandwich with ham and cheese and headed back out another 10 miles to the next shelter.  At a water source a chipmunk had gotten really friendly with people.  He would run really close to me looking for food.  I would make a noise and he would run away but not too far.  Over the past week we have all been feeling the trail has become monotonous.  We just want to hang out, camp, and not hike.  It's coming down to the mental game of finishing now.  I compared the trail to being in a relationship.  In the first part you're in the honeymoon phase.  Everything is new and exciting.  You're happy to just hike on the trail.  Around a 1000 miles it feels like everything has settled and you've worked out the kinks in the relationship.  Somewhere past 1500 miles you feel that this relationship should had only lasted 1500 miles but you grit your teeth and keep in it.  Towards 1800 miles you get into fights and she throws the white mountains, mahoosuc notch, and a 100 mile wilderness at you.  By the the time you climb Mt Katahdin you and the trail have a mutual breakup.  You have learned a lot of lessons along the way but it's time to end it.  
I hiked to the lookout about 3 miles away.  Scatter, Scooter, and Giggles were there.  It was a cabin with a tower built on top of it.  From the tower you could see for miles.  I talked with Giggles for a bit.  We talked about our lives as expats.  She was considering going abroad again but didn't want to teach English.  She was going to stay at the cabin tonight since it was getting late.  I pushed onto the shelter.  It got dark and I had to use my headlamp for the last mile.  I arrived at the shelter to find Scooter and Scatter camping and eating dinner.  Someone had built a fire near their tent site.  I had missed the smell of fire for some time.  It seems no one wants to build fires anymore.  When we get into camp we're too tired to do anything but setup camp and eat.  I ate some couscous for dinner then called it a night.

A chipmunk came by and tried to steal some food.  It must have tasted human food before.  I packed up and headed out the shelter.  
My ankle was acting up today and I had to put it in a brace.  It was slow going after that.  I got to a gap and noticed a sign for on the edge farm.  It had food and drinks.  That's all I needed to read. I bought some Starbucks moca, a breakfast sandwich, pastry, pickle, and cherry tomatoes.  I met a hiker named Striker who had slowed down due to an injury and got behind her tramily.  She said she could only average 15 mile days.  I headed out from there to the next gap about 4 miles away.  There was a sign about a place to buy food about 100 yards down the road.  The couple who owned the place southbound hiked the AT a few years ago.  They had bought a farm next to the AT and started a family.  When I went to their back porch there was an 8 month old baby furrowing his brow at me.  Loon the house owner welcomed me in.  I bought a homemade ice cream sandwich and hung out.  A bunch of SOBO hikers showed up and took over the porch.  They didn't even know they were in a SOBO bubble since they really didn't see anyone.  I got some tips on hiking the whites from them.  I got off the porch and headed out.
I still had another 12 miles to do and it was already 3 o'clock.  I wasn't going to make it to the shelter.  I climbed out of the gap and hiked as far as I could without having to setup late in the dark.  I made it about 10 miles with a stream and a few flat tent pads.  I setup my tent and ate a bagel with ham, cheese, tomatoes, and hot sauce.  It really hit the spot after another long mile day.  The air got cooler and I was glad I would be getting my cold gear weather tomorrow.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601917,"I woke up a little earlier than usual to get a head start on the day.  It was cold again last night and I had to bundle up inside my sleeping bag to stay warm.  I rolled out of my tent to make oatmeal and coffee for breakfast.  My ankle was hurting a lot this morning as I grabbed my food.  I put on my ankle brace then headed up the mountain.  I had an 8 mile hike into Hanover, NH today.   
There was a small climb up Happy Hill then it was downhill until Elm Street.  At Elm Street there was coke trail magic!  I hung out on the chairs and enjoyed a cold soda.  About 100 yards down the road there was banana bread and watermelon.  In another 100 yards there was a hiker box with duct tape that I needed.  It was the trail magic mile!  In a mile I arrived at the small town of Norwich.  It had many historical locations.   Scatter later told me there was a place for free sandwiches but I missed out on them.  From Norwich it was a 1.5 mile road walk to Hanover, NH.  I crossed the Connecticut river and was officially in New Hampshire.  The live free or die state.   As I walked into town I noticed a lot of people in their teens and twenties.  It was home to Dartmouth college.  Main street reminded me of the drag in Austin but much fancier.   I called Booger Bear to find out where he was in town.  He just got a ride to Lebanon to visit the outfitters there.  He told me about free donuts and pizza in town for thru hikers.  I stopped my Lou's and got a free donut.  I stopped by the post office to grab my cold weather gear.  I swapped out my summer gear.  My pack was instantly fatter and heavier.   It's going to be tough carrying it through the whites and Maine.  Sunshine and Forgiven were there.  They had resupplied then opened their box at the post office to reveal more food and ended up throwing a lot of it in the hiker box.  
I walked over to Brick and Oven to get my free slice of pizza. Snorts was there who I hadn't seen since PA.  She told me that Chomps had to get off the trail because his ankle never improved.   I could feel his pain.  Scatter walked in and we hung out for a bit.   I told him that I was thinking about hiking another 10 miles.   He wasn't really feeling it especially after beer and pizza.  We headed to Molly's for more beer.   Booga met us there for a drink. He said he was going to wait in town for Giggles.  Scatter and I went to Boloco for burritos.  We met Blaze on the way who joined us.  Boloco was exactly like Chipotle.  I got a huge bowl with rice, chicken, guacamole, corn, salsa, and veggies. It definitely hit the spot.  Scatter was feeling even more tired and didn't want to leave town.  I felt the urge to not get vortexed in Hanover and walked to the edge of town.  At the edge I ran into Rebel Yell and Scooter.  They were not feeling the urge to leave either.   Rebel Yell had zeroed there already.  It seems that the trail funk had been hitting everyone.  I got the heck out of there.  It was 6 pm and I planned on doing 8 miles.  My pack felt like it had stones in it with the cold weather gear.  I was considering sending some stuff home that was too heavy since it would be hard to carry through the whites.  I ran into Sunshine on the trail. She had forgotten a prescription in town and had to go back.   Forgiven was 10 miles ahead of her.  I helped her with her bear hang and kept on trucking.  Night fell and I was night hiking again.  It seems to be the common theme for this section.  I eventually arrived at Brinks stream.  There was already 3 tents in the area.  I setup my tent on a small island near the stream.  I didn't want to cook dinner and just ate some Cliff bars.   I hung my food and settled into bed.  I saw a mouse dart around my campsite looking for food.  He kept getting really close.   Later I felt something hit the side of my tent.   It was a  toad!  He was climbing over my stuff in my vestibule.  He hopped out but then about 5 minutes later he was back again.  He visited me 3 times and I was excited to see him each time.

The 15 mile section included 3 large climbs  today.  The first climb was right from the campsite up moose mountain.  It was pretty easy compared to other climbs.  The moose mountain shelter had a privy without walls.  Anyone could walk up on you sitting on the throne.  I hiked to the next mountain that had holts ledge.  It was more tough as the climb was steeper.  I ate lunch up there and caught up on my journal.  A group of Dartmouth teens were looking for the ledges and I pointed them in the right direction.  I climbed down off mountain then got ready for smarts mountain.  It was the largest climb of the day.  On the way up I met a woman who was picking trumpet mushrooms.  I told her I had seen several different types of mushrooms while hiking the AT.  She offered to take my trash which I gladly accepted.  I pushed on to the top of smarts mountain.  It was easy at first.  Then came the ridgeline with solid granite.  It was hard on my feet.  The final climb up the mountain was steep and slippery.  It was smooth slanted rock.  I pushed up the mountain to make it to the sunset.  I arrived at the fire tower all sweaty and out of breath.  The sun was still in the sky and I watched from the fire tower as the sun turned the sky a bright orange.  It disappeared behind a cloud.  It was really windy on the fire tower and I was cold from my sweat filled shirt.  Maga had built a fire at the shelter which was more like a cabin.  It had 4 walls with screens in the windows to keep the bugs out.  I went outside and made beef enchiladas for dinner.  I quickly ate it since I was so hungry.  I setup my sleeping bag in the cabin then called it.

Maga and I struck up a conversation about living abroad.  He had studied Chinese in China and had lived there for 3 years.  He had spent a good amount of time in Vietnam.  We talked about all the wonderful food there.  Maga worked as an accountant and only worked 4 months out of the year.  He made enough during the tax season to travel and live off what he earned. We split up near the shelter and I hiked on to the of Mt Cube.   The climb was almost as long as Smarts mountain.  At the top I could see the mountain where I slept.  I ate lunch then hiked on.  The descent was much easier as the ground laid way to a decent grade where I could hike around 3 miles per hour.    At the bottom I grabbed more water then hiked on.  There were a few more climbs but not as big as Mt Cube.  I arrived in Glencliff around 7:30 pm.   
At the hikers welcome hostel Double Stack and Mbtap were there.  I got a bunk and did laundry.  Ben Tillman sent me a package from Austin.  It was filled with candy, snacks, and Jameson!   I was happy to have enough food to get me over Mt Moosilauke tomorrow.   I hung out in the common area watching movies until 10 pm.

The initial start was pretty gradual and it wasn't that bad.  There were fields and a few road walks.  I got about 2 miles up then ran into Maga filtering water at a stream.  We hiked on together.  The climb got steeper and more rocky.  We then ran into Ham, Rolly, Fungi, Twigs, and Natty Daddy.  Natty Daddy was carrying a Natural Light Beer from Georgia to Maine.   Natural Light had started following his pictures on Instagram and had sent him some Natty Swag.   Maga and I pushed on from there.  I had to stop and eat something since my stomach was growling.   Maga pushed on to the top.  It was another hour of climbing when I reached a flat section and the trail opened up.  I was about a mile from the summit.  As I walked closer to the summit I could see that the treeline stopped and opened up to a field of grasses and rocks.   Cairns marked the path on the top.  I stumbled across lose rocks but eventually made it to the summit.  The clouds were covering the mountain but there were a few breaks that led to amazing views of the valley below. Maga was at the summit by the Moosilauke sign that I had seen so much through Instagram posts.  Double Stack came up the other side since he was slack packing.  The clouds opened up and I could see the other side of the whites. The range was massive as it went on into the distance.  I was getting really hungry and made Mac N Cheese on the mountain.  It really hit the spot.  Natty Daddy and Natty Light pulled out a Natural Light flag and got a picture next to the Moosilauke sign.  There were a group of college kids there that got excited when they saw the sign.  Probably because that's what they drank on a regular basis. We continued to hang out on the mountain for an hour then headed back down the other side.  
The climb down was supposed to be worse then the side we went up.   It wasn't so bad at first.  We stopped at the shelter to grab water then head back down.  A whole group from Tuffs college was there.  They were interested in us and thru hiking.  They asked the typical questions about how long we were on trail and how had it gone so far. Maga and I left and then headed down Mt Moosilauke.  The trail disappeared and was replaced by boulders, steep slanted rocks, thick roots, steep stairs, and mud.  We had to go down really slow to keep from tripping and killing ourselves.  The terrain could have been on the next American Ninja Warrior.  At one point I almost tripped on my trekking pole which would have flung me down a steep rock into trees.  Another part of the trail looked like it was hit with a boulder.  There wasn't much to stand on except a few rocks.  Luckily there was a rope to hang on to.  It took us about 2 hours to go 1.5 miles.  We were warned about low mile days in the whites.  At the road crossing we got a hitch into Lincoln.  The driver had picked up several hikers before and knew about Chet's place in town.  Chet allowed hikers to stay at his place for free or if you had some money to donate.  
When we arrived at Chet's a man came hobbling down the stairs and sat in a wheelchair.  He asked us a series of questions like where did you come from and what mountain you would be climbing next.  We answered the kinsman mountains.  He said that was wrong.   We didn't know and he said thru hikers would know which mountain they would be hiking over next.  He was just messing with us.  He let us into his place and showed us around.  There was a common room with bunks, laundry, and a shower.  He had a whole bunch of hiker supplies and food as well.  Maga and I got settled in then went to the Price chopper to resupply.  I got enough food for 3 days and then headed to McDonald's.  Maga showed off his Chinese speaking skills when he asked the woman at the counter where she was from in China.  We ate off the dollar menu since it was the most calories per buck.  Back at Chet's there was his story in a binder on the table.  Chet was an avid hiker and was a big part of the hiker community.  He was an outdoors man and loved the mountains.  One day he was tinkering with his camp stove when it exploded in his face.  The stove had burned 40 percent of his body and he had inhaled some of the white gas which burned his lungs.  He was hospitalized for months and the doctors put him in a chemically induced coma since the pain was so bad.  Through all the medications he had lost his ability to walk.  By opening his house to hikers he can live through them.  I hope he can get back on the trail someday.  I put the book down then headed to bed.  
Tonight I'm thinking how Chet can get back on the trail.","Hikers Welcome Hostel

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601921,"It seemed that everyone had slept in this morning.  No one was moving around before 7 am.  A jack russell named Jax jumped in bed with me to cuddle.  I was really happy.  It reminded me when Theo was still on the trail.  He would visit everyone in the morning and give out love.  I started packing up and Chet came rolling in.  He warned us about the thunderstorms that show up in the afternoon.  You don't want to be above treeline when they hit.  I said my goodbyes and Chet said we could always come back even in the winter.  I'm sure he doesn't get many hikers then.  I walked down main street and shipped my sleeping bag liner back home.  I really didn't need it.  I met Maga at Dunkin Donuts and got 2 bagel sandwiches, an iced coffee, and a donut. I would need all the calories I could get.  We stopped by the McDonald's so Maga could get more food.  A Korean war veteran named Jim offered us a ride back to the trail.  We gladly accepted his offer.  His late wife would pick up hikers in the area.  He told us about the fire they had on the mountain.  We could see the whole side of the mountain was missing trees.  He dropped us off at the trailhead.  We stay saw Double Stack, Twigs, Ambassador, Mud Bug, and Moonpie there.  They had just gotten dropped off from the Hikers Welcome Hostel.  They mentioned that there was some trail magic on the trail.  It was a cooler filled with soda, candy, and local peaches. I had my fill then got back on the trail.
We would be climbing Mt Wolf today.  It was only a 3500 foot mountain.  The terrain was still tough though.  We had to climb up boulders using roots as supports.  There were plenty of areas were you could easily trip and get hurt yourself.  It was slow hiking.  They say you can't do big miles in the whites and it's true unless you want to hike late into the night.  I wouldn't want to hike at night on this stuff.  Maga and I talked about a fictional phone game called Legend of the AT.  It would use your phone's GPS to figure out where you were.  The game would entail finding treasures along the trail.  Your character's health would be affected by what you would be eating for that day.  The terrain would affect your character's health and mood.  It would also include all the information that Guthooks had.  We talked about the hiker IBTap and his YouTube channel.  He would get resupply packages from his fans.  We thought about trolling him with resupply packages.  We could send him either melted ice cream bars, only sauce packets, or my lucky rock collection.  He would have to go out of his way to pick up the package too.  We continued to climb up Mt Wolf and it seemed to take forever.  I think the rest of the whites are going to go slower too.  We ran into Double Stack taking a nap on a log.  He had been there for an hour.  We made it to the top of Mt Wolf but there wasn't a view.  We hiked over more mud pits and root mazes until we arrived at the Eliza Brook Shelter.
At the shelter a group of college kids had started setting up.   They were pretty noisy as they took over one side of the camping spots.  I claimed a spot before they could take it over then called my sister to catch up.  Back at my site Maga and I started singing Careless Whisper by George Michael then Twigs joined us.  I made some Chili Mac and Cheese.  Then Twigs broke out his guitar and started singing other songs with Maga.  I joined them and listened along.  I made my way to bed.  The college kids were still noisy.  I joked with Maga about being a bear and scaring all of them.  I then drifted off.
Tonight I'm hoping the college kids shut up.","Chet's House

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601922,"The college kids woke up early this morning.  They were making a lot of noise.  At one point they were doing jumping jacks.  I had no idea that you needed that kind of warm up for this hike.  I ate raisin brand cereal and some poptarts for breakfast.  Maga and I headed out around 8:30 am for the Kinsman mountains.
The hike up the Kinsman was a challenge.  It was steep. In many spots we needed to pull ourselves up with roots and trees since the trail was so slanted.  Many of the rocks were wet which didn't help either.  I was constantly worried that I was going to trip.  It took us two hours to hike up the South Kinsman.  At the top we could see the ever expanding valley below.  In the distance was the presidential mountains.  We could see Mt Washington jutting up into the clouds.  I ate some snacks and made myself a sandwich.  We hung out there for an hour taking in the view.  Twig shared some of his gummy worms and starburst with us.  I wanted to eat the whole bag.  I was on a sugar binge.  We headed for North Kinsman.  It was a pretty short hike to the other mountain.  Maga at the summit Maga found that someone defecated and put a rock over it.  He used a log to push it off the ledge.  It was pretty nasty.  
We then hiked down the south side of the mountain.  It was the same terrain as climbing the mountain and took us awhile to get down.  We checked out the Kinsman pond shelter.  The caretaker wasn't there since he was sick.  The shelter was built with quality.  It was almost like a log cabin.  The only problem was that the pond was the water source.  We then hiked down to the lost pond hut.  The hut had a huge kitchen inside with drinks and snacks.  Their dinner menu looked amazing too.  The workers had to carry all the food up the mountain to the hut for making breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  We saw one woman carrying a heavy pack of veggies for the meals.  She had to carry it 1.6 miles .  Some hikers had to carry food for 5 miles in other huts.  I got a coffee and some coffee cake and hung out for a little bit.  We then headed out.  We ran into Twig about a mile down the trail taking a bath in the river.  He was washing his clothes as well.  His plan was to make it on top of Franconia ridge tonight.  Maga and I were not feeling that climb and decided to go back into town to stay at Chet's.  We threw rocks into the river trying to skip them across.  I threw a huge rock in and got Maga pretty wet.  We headed out to Franconia Notch to get a ride back into town.  
A woman picked us up on route 3 and took us back to Lincoln, NH.  She had just finished hiking and saw that we were probably as tired as she was.  She dropped us off at the Price Chopper.  I got a text from Scissors saying that she wanted to have a get together for Kazi who was jumping ahead to the 100 mile wilderness.  I thought that the event would be today but she was going over the section we just did.  I'm going to miss it because I need to take less zeros to finish the trail on time.  At Chet's Too Sweet, Butters, Griz, 50 cent, Sparrow, and Scatter were there.  They were planning on slacking the section we just did.  Scatter had been feeling sick and the doctor thought it was Lyme disease.  He was on doxy to fight it. I hope he feels better.  Maga and I grabbed pizza for dinner.  It was pretty tasty.  Back at Chet's I took a shower and called it a night.
Tonight I'm passing out on a pretty dirty bed but at least it's free.","Eliza Brook Shelter

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601923,"Today I woke up pretty sweaty at Chet's place.  His place was hot last night.  I got up around 7 am. Only a few people were awake.  I heard Chet rolling around and talking to other hikers.  He was in his element.  Butters, Too Sweet, 50 Cent, and Scatter were going to slack pack over Mt Wolf and Kinsman.  It would be much easier with a lighter pack.  Maga and I ate our breakfast burritos that we bought the other night.  They were pretty bad and it was hard to finish them.  Scatter was wondering if he should slack pack since he had been feeling sick for the past few days.  Maga and I headed out for our climb up Franconia ridge.  We grabbed coffee at the gas station.  A man named Dave asked if we needed a ride back to beaver creek but we were headed to Franconia Notch.  He went on his way.  Maga and I walked a short distance and Dave drove up to us and offered us a ride.  Dave was retired and moved to the area 3 years ago.  He had hiked all over the white mountains too.  Dave dropped us off at the access road.  We got our packs ready and headed for the climb up to Franconia ridge.
The sky was blue and clear from the beginning.  It was warm as well.  The trail up to the first campsite before the ridge was well maintained.  It had boulder steps and was clear of roots.  You could tell this path was more popular than Mt Wolf or the Kinsman.  We made it up to a campsite and met a guy named Deluxe.  He was called that because he carried a lot of extra weight.  He had hiked many trails around the states and some abroad.  Maga and him talked about the PCT a lot.  We hiked together just before the treeline ended.  Maga and I needed a snack break.  I ate a thawed chimichanga and a bagged salad.  I also called Theresa to catch up on what was going on in Austin.  By this time clouds had rolled in and there wasn't anything to see.  We hiked out onto the ridgeline and was instantly greeted with freezing wind in the clouds.  The weather forecasted 40 to 60 mile per hour winds with gusts up to 75 miles per hour.  I had to put on my warmer layers since my rain coat wasn't doing enough.  We hiked on the exposed ridge and saw nothing because of all the clouds.  At Mt Lafayette we decided to head to the Greenleaf hut to try score a work for stay.  It was 1 mile downhill and we didn't think any thru hikers would make the trek.  The downhill to the hut was steep and wet.  We were worried that we wouldn't be able to stay in the hut since other hikers could be there.  
When we arrived at the hut there wasn't any other hikers there. Janna, Charlotte, Kyle, and Allie were the hut's croo.  We asked Janna if we could do a work for stay and they did!  She told us that we really didn't need to do anything until 7:30 pm.  Charlotte gave the history of the huts in the whites.  Some had been around since the 1880s.  We watched as they served salad, pizza, soup, and cookies for dinner for all the guests.   We would get to eat after everyone else.  The clouds eventually parted over the ridgeline and we could see the Franconia ridge.  Part of the ridge was still covered with clouds and they draped over like a blanket.  The clouds were flowing over a section of the ridgeline.  It looked surreal.  At 7:30 pm the croo fed us the leftovers.  They were so good.  I made sure to eat everything.  The pizza was really tasty as well as the soup.  Afterwards they put us to work scraping pots and pans.  Maga sang Garth Brooks songs as we scrubbed along.  The croo told us that we could stop cleaning since the pans took awhile.  They let us setup our sleeping stuff in the common area.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601924,"The croo at the hut woke us up around 6 am.  I usually don't get up that early but they were going to serve breakfast at 7 am.  I packed my things and watched as the croo served breakfast.  It was pancakes, oatmeal, sausage, and eggs.  I was starving as I watched everyone eat.  All the guests eventually left and it was our turn to eat.  We had a couple plates each.  Kyle had made breakfast burritos for the croo.  He couldn't finish his and shared it with Maga.  Our duty this time was to sweep the hut.  We went above and beyond their expectations.  I even swept out the restroom which hikers usually don't do.  We finished sweeping and packed up our stuff.  We said goodbye to the croo and set out to climb back up Mt Lafayette. 
The clouds were parting and we see the valley below.  It stretched out in the distance for several miles.  The boulder path from yesterday was really clear.  We could see the other mountains that we were hiking to.  I got a few pictures of the terrain.  It didn't seem real.  We hiked down to the saddle that connected Franconia with Mt Garfield.  Climbing up Mt Garfield was tricky with boulder climbs and roots.  At the top I stopped to eat lunch.  I made a ham and cheese sandwich.  Maga ate some poptarts and headed out.  The hike down the south side of Mt Garfield was more difficult than the climb up.  A stream flowed down the path and it turned into a steep rock face.  I was just trying to keep my feet from slipping down the rock face.  The trail leveled out once I got to the bottom of the mountain.  I hiked on to the Galehead hut.  I bought a bowl of tomato soup with corn and rice. 
The climb out of Galehead hut to South Twin mountain was 1100 feet over .8 miles.  It was really steep and I huffed my stuff to the top of the mountain.  There I was greeted with a view of Mt Washington in the distance.  The top of the mountain was clear which rarely happens.  I could see the route that I would be hiking over the next few days.  I pushed on and planned on camping at the Guyot shelter but learned it was .6 off trail. I pushed on to Zealand pond another 2 miles away.  This section of trail reminded me of the old days where I could hike at least 2 miles an hour.  It felt good to go faster.  At the pond Maga, Valc, and Tom Brady were there.  They had decided on the same thing.  Grabbing water at the pond was a little tricky since most of the shore was mud.  I hiked over some rocks to get the water.  It was a yellow color and I made sure to chemically treat it too.  I ate another bagel with ham and cheese.  I didn't feel like cooking again.  When I went to hang my bear bag I noticed a bunch of small owls in the trees staring down at me.  They didn't make a sound and when they flew.  It got dark and the temperature dropped.  It was time for bed.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602322,"This morning I was planning on going to the hut to grab breakfast but I slept in late.  It seemed that no one wanted to get up early.  I got up and packed my tent.  I ate peanut butter and raisin bran for breakfast.  We headed out together and soon came to Zealand cliffs.  You could see into the valley.  Luckily the clouds didn't block our view.  There was phone service there and I took my time to update my journal.  Maga pushed on while I was busy updating my site.  
From the cliffs was a mile downhill to Zealand hut.  I got coffee, chicken ginger soup, and a lemon poppy seed muffin.  It was all really good.  I'll miss the huts when I'm out of the whites.  From Zealand falls it was really flat for 5 miles.  I zoomed down the trail since there was not any obstacles.  The trail dropped into Crawford Gap.  The hut was .5 off trail and I decided to skip it.  I started climbing the presidential range.  It was a tough climb with all the normal trail obstacles.  I grabbed 3 liters of water on my way up to make sure I had enough for a stealth spot.  Carrying 3 liters is tough.  Especially up a steep hill that doesn't get easier.  Close to Mt Webster I found a stealth spot.  It was a small patch of pine needles with flat ground.  I didn't want to keep climbing until it got dark.  I setup my tent and cooked a pasta side for dinner.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602323,"The sun hit my tent from the other side of the mountain.  I was cozy in my small stealth spot.  I had a big day ahead of me.  I would be hiking over the presidential mountains today.  Most of them are over treeline and you can't camp for 12 miles.  I got up and ate peanut butter and raisin bran for breakfast.  I mixed instant coffee with hot cocoa for an extra energy boost. I packed up my tent then headed out at 8:30 am.
The initial climb was over Webster cliffs.  Some areas were sheer rock faces that I had to climb up with my hands.  The views of the valley were spectacular though.  I kept climbing until I was in the Alpine region.  Trees gave way to large exposed mountains.  The mountains were composed of white granite where they got their name.  I passed several people hiking since it was Labor day weekend.  The mountain was full of day hikers.  I hiked with authority and most people stopped to let me through.  If I had to wait for everyone that would add an hour to my day.  I stopped at the Mitzpah hut for soup and coffee.  They had free breakfast leftovers which I devoured.  I pushed on to the presidential range.  The range seemed to go on forever.  I stopped and talked to a day hiker about hiking the range in the winter.  Apparently it's easier when you don't have to hike over boulders.  With 10 feet of snow you can just glide right over them.  At the lakes of the clouds hut I got minestrone soup.  It really hit the spot.  From there it was a 1.4 mile ascent to Mt Washington.  The trail up became small boulders.  I had to skip from rock to rock and it was slow going.  At the top was a zoo.  There were tons of people on the summit.  People were driving and taking a train to the top.  At the summit sign there was a line to take a picture next to it.  I really didn't feel like waiting in line.  Valc and 50 cent were trying to find a campsite off trail because they didn't want to pay the AMC.  I pushed forward to try to make it to the Madison spring hut.  
The trail turned into loose boulders and I went slow.  It felt like Pennsylvania except that trail gave you a break from the rocks.  It was mostly rocks the entire way to Madison Hut.  Luckily the rocks were not slick and surprisingly my feet were not in pain from the constant pounding.  I could see the valley below but also a huge dark cloud coming my way.  The area darkened as the clouds started blowing past.  The wind picked up but it wasn't that hard.  I came to a junction that took me down a wrong path since the cairns went in several directions.  Luckily Stretch showed up at pointed out the right direction.  We hiked a mile down to the Madison Hut.
The Hut was crowded when we arrived.  The croo had just served dinner.  Stretch and I went in and asked if we could do a work for stay.  They were happy to have the extra help.  We waited until everyone finished eating then it was our turn.  They fed us stuffed pasta shells with cheese.  I had about 3 plates worth.  It was so good.  We also ate pretzel bread and chocolate muffins.  I was stuffed.  Our chore was to deep clean the drying racks to get them ready for the seasonal close.  The croo was really animated and really enjoyed working at the hut.  They worked 11 days on and 3 days off. The AMC charged them $90 a month for food and board.  The time got close to 9:30 pm which is lights out time at the hut.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602325,"I was awoken this morning by one of the croo making baked goods at 5 am.  Stretch, Blue Stripe, and I woke up and watched everyone eat breakfast.  We waited for our turn to eat.  One of the croo brought over corn bread, oatmeal, and eggs.  We devoured it all.  They were happy that we ate it since they would have had to pack it out.  Our morning chore was to make the bunks and sweep the floors.  It only took us around 30 minutes to do.  Stretch, Blue Stripe, and I headed out around 9:30 am.  
From the Madison hut there was a 600 foot climb to the top of Mt Madison.  At the top clouds were blowing across at 30 to 40 mph.  Blue Stripe almost lost his pack cover.  I had to use my trekking poles to keep myself balanced on the rocks.  Right when we crossed over the peak the wind subsided.  The way down was all boulders and loose rock.  My trekking poles helped me make my way down.  The clouds at the along the ridge seemed to dance in the air as the valley heated up.  It took me 2 and 1/2 hours to descend from the presidential ridge.  I was happy to leave the Alpine area so I could camp anywhere again.  The trail flattened out as it entered the valley.  On my way to the Pinkham notch visitors center I ran into 50 cent on the trail.  He was bugging a little bit from his hike yesterday.  From Mt Washington he took a side trail that was really steep.  It was basically a steep boulder pit.  At one point he dislodged a boulder about the size of himself and it went rolling down the mountain.  As it gained speed the boulder started splitting and jumping into the air 15 feet.  It was probably going 80 mph.  Luckily there wasn't anyone below. In some parts he had to slide on his butt to make it down. At the bottom of the trail he had to use his orienteering skills to meet Valc and Tom Brady at a stealth site.  50 cent was on pain killers since he hurt his back.  He was planning on taking it easy today.  At the Pinkham notch visitors center I bought vegan chili and a turkey sandwich.  When they brought it out it was a huge serving of chili.  I could only finish the chili and packed out the sandwich.  
From the notch we started climbing the wildcats.  It was steep and straight up the mountain.  At one point I had to just put my trekking poles away and use my hands to climb.  Stretch and No Problema passed me as they went up the mountain.  We could hear thunder in the distance and knew it could hit at anytime.  Hiking on steep wet rocks doesn't help.  The back of my right knee started hurting from all the climbing.  It feels like its stiff.  At the first peak we came to a chairlift for the ski resort.  It had just started raining and we took cover under the chairlift.  We watched as the clouds came rolling over the presidential ridge.  Then the rain stopped and the clouds parted to let the sun shine through.  There were clouds in the valley but they disappeared after a few minutes.  In background we could see a double rainbow!  It was an epic moment to witness.  The rain completely stopped and we hiked on.  The steep rocks were now a bit harder to hike on.  We kept pushing forward to the hut for a possible work for stay.  It got dark and we put on our headlamps.  I almost fell a few times in the dark but I always caught myself.  There was a steep descent to the hut.  When we arrived we could see the lights in the hut.  Maga was in there cleaning the dishes.  We didn't ask the croo if we could have a work for stay since it was so late.  We asked him about stealth sites in the area.  He mentioned Carter mountain which was a steep climb and I wasn't feeling it.  He also mentioned a spot .25 off trail that we could use.  Around 9 pm the croo shut off the lights and we had to make our way to the stealth site.  It had rained a lot but had let up.  We made our way to the site to find 3 other tents there.  They had also tried to stay at the hut too but failed.  It started raining again and I hurried to setup my tent.  I didn't even have time to do a bear bag hang.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602326,"I slept pretty well last night as the rain fell down.  A puddle started forming under my tent but it didn't get too wet inside though.  I woke up to find that I had camped next to Santiago.  He was planning on hiking the section I would be doing today.  It didn't seem as crazy as the Wildcats but there was still some pretty good climbs.  I went up to the hut to grab some coffee and baked goods.  Maga was there eating breakfast with the other hikers that did a work for stay.  He was waiting on some packages in town and would be taking it easy until they came in.  I filled my water and got ready for the day.  
The initial hike up Carter dome was a steep one.  It took me about an hour to go one mile.  At the top I could see Mt Washington and the route I came down yesterday.  I ran into Bear Claw at one of the peaks and we hiked together for a few hours.  She was supported by her husband and two kids that follow her in a truck all the way up the trail.  Bear Claw was from Thailand.  She had met her husband while giving him a nature tour in Thailand.  Her husband decided to hit on her and 14 years, a marriage, and two kids later they are still going strong.  Her husband had a kush government job but he quit to help her on the trail.  They are running on fumes but are very happy.  Bear Claw is planning on hiking with her daughter Crusty Butt sometime soon.  We stopped to take a break and dry out our stuff.  Santiago and Stretch passed as I was eating and talking to Theresa.  I packed up my stuff and headed out.  
The rest of the trail down was more boulders and roots.  At one point I slipped on a board and my whole foot went in the water.  It was soaked and covered in mud.  I kept pushing on.  At the bottom of a 3 mile descent I came to the rattle river shelter.  A woman named Freddy was giving out trail magic!  She had foraged for wild mushrooms and cooked them.  There was also cheese, crackers, guacamole, fried chicken, and hot dogs.  I helped her with getting the fire going.  I ate a bit of food at the shelter then headed out with Bear Claw and Easy Bake.  Bear Claw was talking about an all you can eat Chinese restaurant in town.  Down the trail her husband and two kids surprised us.  They were waiting for her on the trail.  The boy named Duct Poop wanted me to go with them to the Chinese restaurant.  It really didn't take much to convince me.  We met a man named Marathon man who had hiked the trail in 1991 and 2011.  He kept repeating his stories and couldn't remember my name after telling him several times.  He mentioned that he lived north of Katahdin with his wife.  I went with Bear Claw and her family to get some Chinese food.  The buffet was not bad but I was starving anyways.  The kids wanted to sit next to me and were bouncing off the walls.  It seemed that they couldn't sit still.  Santiago and Easy Bake joined us for dinner.  I plowed through a few plates of food.  The bill came and it was all combined with the family.  Bear Claw's husband paid for my food!  A two trail magic day.  They dropped me off at the hostel and I said goodbye to them.
At the hostel they made me take off my shoes outside.  They then had me take a shower and wear town clothes before I could enter.  It's one way of keeping a hostel clean.  My bunk was really clean with its own sheets and a blanket.  Way fancier than other hostels.  Stretch and I watched a movie on Netflix called Goon.  I didn't pay too much attention as I texted Theresa and worked on my journal.  The hour hit midnight and it was time.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602789,"Last night I was pretty wired and couldn't really sleep well.  There was a guy on the bottom bunk that would cough but it sounded more like a bear.  I eventually fell asleep around 2 am.  I got up at 8 am to make myself pancakes that the hostel included.  I ate 3 large cakes and a few cups of coffee.  I signed up for the noon shuttle that took you to town then to Walmart.  I lounged around and hung outside.  Growler showed up.  He had taken a lot of zeros and was allowing everyone to catch up with him.  Then Hails and Fish Ears showed up.  They had stayed at the Imp shelter about 7 miles back.  
We all crammed into the shuttle.  It seemed that the driver was impatient with us but that's typical when you got to herd hiker cats around.  He dropped us off in Gorham and would come back in 2 hours to take us to Walmart.  I stopped at the outfitters that was also a hardware store.  They really didn't have much but I picked up 8 new tent stakes that were lighter than my collected ones.  Hails, Fish Ears, and I went to the local BBQ joint in town.  I ordered a ruben made with pulled pork and a couple ribs.  It was not bad but Texas BBQ is still better.   I learned that Hails used to be on a rowing team in college.  She would go to Austin to compete sometimes.  She was the person that told everyone to row and was good at bossing people around.  After lunch we walked back to the outfitters to wait for the shuttle. Another hiker there was talking about slack packing the 21 miles from Pinkham notch to US 2 where the hostel was.  It had taken other hikers 14 hours to do that trek.  He hadn't night hiked either and really didn't want to do it.  But his pack weighed a lot and he didn't want to carry it up the Wildcats.  He kept complaining that the hostel van should leave earlier than 7 am so he wouldn't have to night hike.  I told him not to slack if he was really worried about night hiking.  He was determined to do the slack though.  I hope he doesn't rush it since it's easy to get hurt on that terrain.  The shuttle showed up to take us to Walmart.  Another hiker named Hills thought it was going back to the hostel and he threw a fit.  Apparently when his blood pressure spikes he can get in a fowl mood.  The driver said he would go back to pick him up after Walmart.  Hills just sat on the bench and waited for his return. At Walmart I bought too much food as usual.  I also replaced the Sawyer mini I found in a hiker box with a squeeze since the water flow had been so bad with the mini.  I even popped a Sawyer bag trying to force water through the mini.  
Back at the hostel Maga was there.  He had come down from the mountain.  He had met a girl named Grape that he had been hiking with for the past few days.  Deluxe mentioned that he bought food to make burritos for the hostel staff.  I said I could help him cut veggies and meat for the meal.  He took me up on the offer.  I called my parents and thanked them for the resupply package they had sent me. It included a good amount of alcohol that I shared with everyone.  My dad had sent some of his home made salsa that was really good.  I got in the kitchen and laid out all the alcohol for everyone then got to work chopping vegetables.  Stretch just watched me as I cut the green peppers and onions.  We laid out a spread of cheese, beans, rice, guacamole, chicken fajitas, chips, and tortillas.  The hostel staff loved the food.  Maga had been doing a work for stay and also ate some grub.  We hung out in the common area.  Stretch put on the movie The Replacements and I zoned out for a little bit.  I made sure to stretch my legs since they would be working tomorrow.  I started falling asleep on the floor and went to bed.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602791,"I slept better than the previous night by using melatonin to help me sleep.  I got up around 8 am and went into the common room to find Maga making pancakes.  He was making them for everyone as part of his work for stay.  I really didn't want to start hiking early and decided to start sometime in the afternoon.  I got my pack ready with the food resupply and did some health insurance errands online.  I ate my bagged salad that I got from Walmart.  I had to eat something healthy.  I finally rolled out around around 1 pm after the rain stopped and planned on hiking to a shelter about 12 miles away.  
The first climb of the day was gradual as I headed out.  The trail was relatively easy with not much roots or rocks.  I ran into Blue Stripe who had snapped his trekking pole.  Luckily Leki was going to send him a new end.  At a lake I ran into a SOBO who was setting up camp.  She mentioned that the next section was really beautiful with plenty of views.  I was excited to climb up there.  I pushed on and golden hour started to come into play.  The golden orange sun hid behind the clouds.  I got signal and called my sister to talk about my niece Sofia.  At one point I came to a downhill with lots of roots and fell.  My legs went sideways and I kicked my trekking poles down the hill.  Luckily I only scraped my arm and pressed on.  I heard some talking next to a lake to find HAM and Rolly setting up camp.  I told them I was going to hike to the shelter and kept going.  
It was getting dark as I was entering a bog section.  It was hard to tell which boards would cause me to slip in the bog.  It became totally dark and I put on my headlamp.  The trees were so thick that I couldn't see deep into them.  It felt like someone was staring at me.  About a mile from the shelter I took another spill and bent my trekking pole.  I bent it back and kept moving on.  The sign to the shelter appeared in the darkness.  I followed the trail to find that everyone was already asleep in the shelter.  I quietly setup my stuff and hung out back to make dinner.  As I was cooking some chicken with potatoes a mouse ran up to my food bag.  I smacked him and he ran away.  It was just enough to scare him from eating my food.  I finished eating and put my food in the bear box.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602792,"I woke up early because everyone else was waking up early in the shelter.  I rolled out of bed around 7 am and started packing up.  I got water from the local pond but really didn't feel like drinking it.  I boiled water and made coffee and steel cut oats for breakfast.  Maga walked into the shelter.  He had camped on the hill.  He was planning on pushing ahead today through Mahoosuc notch.  I was thinking it was doable with the upcoming terrain.  We talked about the family of 8 that just finished a thru hike.  It must of been hard to manage that many kids during the hike.  It was also probably rough to carry a two year old through the whites and this section.  You would have to constantly worry about falling.  I had fallen several times in the last few days and would be falling more in Maine.  Maga took off and I took my time.
The initial hike out was up Mt Success.  It was a 1400 foot climb that took around 2 hours to do.  At the top I ran into Maga writing in his journal.  We ended up hiking out together.  We joked about the 24 beer challenge where you had to drink 24 beers, one every hour, and hike 24 miles.  We made up the El Monterey Chimichanga burrito challenge where you packed out 24 frozen burritos and ate one every hour.  It would make you need to dig cat holes every few miles too.  We could hear commotion in the forest.  It was the Maine state line.  The last state!  I got a picture next to the sign and ate some snacks.  After the sign the trail became more of a bog.  Wooden boards traversed long sections of trail to save us from those muddy, dirty, depths.  Maga pushed ahead and I could only see him when there was a clearing.  In the bog land, I went walking around large mud puddles.  Some planks tricked me into thinking it was solid.  I stepped on a wet one and the whole board went under dirty water.  I jump off the board into the bog grass but my foot sunk in and got soaked.  From then on I made sure to look out for the boards that were wet on one end.  As I got closer to the shelter I came to a section with a steep downgrade.  I stepped on a root then fell backwards into a mud pit.  My pack took most of the mud.  Everything on the back was covered.  This is when I decided to stay at the next shelter for the night instead of climbing through Mahoosuc notch at the end of the day.  
I rolled into the shelter around 8 am.  I had been hiking for 8 hours and only made it 9 1/2 miles.  I only took a few breaks too.  Two of the Tennessee trio was there.  I setup my tent and washed off my pack at the water source.  At the shelter I cooked a pasta Knore side and ate a bagel sandwich.  Bliss rolled in an hour and a half later.  In the bog she had taken a detour to get around some mud patch.  She stepped on what she thought was solid ground and her whole leg sunk in up to her thigh.  Her other leg sunk in half way.  Her leg was stuck in the bog and it wouldn't let go.  She threw her pack to a dry section and was stuck there for 35 minutes trying to get out. She tried calling for help but she was the behind everyone.  She moved her stuck leg in a circular motion to get finally get it out.  I'm glad she made it out otherwise we would have gone back to find her.  I finished my food and went to bed.  I called Theresa and caught up with her over the past few days then passed out.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602795,"This morning was pretty cold in my tent. It seems that the temperature is dropping everyday here in Maine.  I got up around 7 am and packed up my tent.  I made oatmeal and coffee next to the shelter.  The Tennessee trio had already left to hike over the Mahoosuc notch.  It took me awhile to eat my oatmeal as usual but I knew it provided sustained energy.  I rolled out of the shelter around 8:30 am.  
The was one little climb before entering the notch.  I made sure to put my trekking poles away and not to have anything outside my pack.  When I got to the beginning of the notch it was a mess of boulders that had fallen from each side of the canyon.  I had to climb over and under rocks.  There were blazes and arrows that pointed the way.  I went a few wrong directions since some areas were not marked well.  At one point an arrow told me to crawl through an opening between two rocks.  I had to take my pack off and push it ahead of me to get through.  I was on all fours crawling through the crevice.  When jumping from boulder to boulder you could easily fall into a pit of sticks or mud.  I also made sure I didn't lose anything in a crevice.  When it was all finished it took me two hours to go one mile.  It's supposed to be the hardest or most fun mile on the trail.  I met up with the Tennessee trio after the notch for a snack.  We were prepping for the Mahoosuc arm which was supposed to be pretty steep.  I ate a bagel with ham and cheese and got ready for the next climb.
The climb up the arm was supposed to be the steepest on the trail.  There were sections were I had to hold onto roots to make my way up.  Another section had steep slanted slate but I managed to pull myself up.  I ran into Santiago coming down the other way. He was headed south towards US 2 where the Rattle River Hostel was. He said he would slide on his butt if he needed to get down the arm.  I finally made it to the top and met with the trio again.  I felt tired and took a nap at the top in the sun.  Afterwards I headed out towards Grafton Notch.  I passed the speck pond site and did another climb up old speck mountain.  At the top was a steel fire tower and I had a 360 view of the mountains around me.  There were several lakes dotting the landscape and the clouds seemed to space themselves out evenly in the distance.  I video chatted Theresa then headed down to Grafton Gap.  I found Frolic and Fish ears there camping.  They were not going any further.  I decided to push onto the shelter about 2 miles away.  The climb was pretty easy until it got darker.  I couldn't tell the trail from a stream.  I went down one trail thinking it was pretty easy.  Then I checked Guthooks to find I went .3 off trail.  I backtracked to the AT and continued the climb.  At the shelter Bear Claw was sleeping there.  She saw me and we caught up over the last few days.  She had built a fire earlier but it had went out.  I boiled water for ramen and added pink salmon.  It was pretty good.  It made Bear Claw hungry again.  I setup my sleeping pad and went to bed.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602796,"This morning was cold at the shelter.  It felt like it got close to freezing.  I'm surprised it's already getting this cold and it's only September 9th.  Bear Claw got up and wasn't having it.  She restarted the fire from last night and had it going in a matter of minutes.  I made my breakfast near the fire.  Bear Claw talked about getting into Rangely, ME on Tuesday.  It seemed we had some difficult climbs in the way before we got there.  I packed up my stuff but didn't get out of camp until 10 am.
From the shelter it was a steep climb up Baleplate mountain.  Luckily volunteers built rock steps all the way up which made it easier than the normal boulder climbing that I had come used to.  At the top you could see the other baldpate mountain that I would be climbing.  It was completely clear of trees and was a large bare rock.  It only took about 30 minutes to climb up the other one.  Frolic, Hills, and Baby Bird were hanging out at the top.  We could see for miles in the distance.  Work Horse climbed up and pointed where his new house would be.  Hills was foraging through short shrubs on the top.  I didn't realize what he was doing for awhile until he mentioned he was picking blueberries!  They were Alpine berries that tasted amazing.  After snacking for a bit I headed down the mountain.  The descent was pretty easy compared to the climb and I made my way to the next shelter to eat a quick lunch.  
I hiked down a gradual descent to East B road there were two shuttles were already waiting for slack packers.  It didn't look like the road got much traffic into town either.  A few slack packers came down to the road and I got a ride from the one shuttle driver for $6.  Andover, ME was a tiny town.  It had two general stores and a few hostels.  I went to the one store to resupply a little bit and ordered a large burger.  The burger really hit the spot.  I met a guy from Miami named Nick.  He planned on just doing the Maine section in 24 days but didn't have any previous hiking experience.  He tried doing larger mile days at the beginning of Maine and ended up hurting his knee.  It wasn't realistic to do big mile days out here with this kind of terrain.  I ate my burger then headed out.  I got the same shuttle driver back to the trailhead.  He charged me $8 to go back since I was the only one.  The driver told me a story about a backpacking trip he did with his son.  He carried about 50 pounds in weight but packed out steak and hotdogs.  At the shelter he started cooking up food and a few thru hikers woke up and smelled the delicious food.  He ended up feeding some hikers as well as a group of woman that showed up.  I wish I was there.  I was dropped back on the trail at 6 pm.  I hiked for 2 miles then ran into Frolic and Baby Bird next to a lake.  They had started a fire and it was so welcoming in this cold that I decided to stay.  I setup my tent and hung out next to the fire.  Frolic talked about old video games that I used to play as a kid and teenager.  I only ate a few snacks since I had the burger earlier.  It got dark and we could see the stars through the trees.  We all didn't want to leave the fire since it was so cold.  It finally rolled past hiker midnight and I was ready for bed.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602798,"I woke up well rested from the previous night.  Frolic, Baby Frolic, and Navi were sleeping in.  I got up and got water near the abandoned cabin. The cabin was falling apart and had graffiti in it.  Thru hikers had stayed in it before calling it a secret shelter.  Back at the campsite people started moving about.  Navi restarted the fire and I was excited to have warmth.  Stretch came rolling by and got sucked into the fire.  He was planning on hiking another 8 miles and staying at the human nature hostel.  We hung out until 10 am.  I was planning on getting to a shelter in 17 miles before it starts raining at 8 pm.  A tropical depression is coming in and it supposed to rain all day tomorrow.  
I pushed out at 10 am with little plans of stopping until the shelter.  The first climb was easy compared to the rest of the climbs in southern Maine.  As I was hiking up I saw Amazonian and Chumbawomba coming towards me!  They had flip flopped to Katahdin and were now heading south.  Chumbawomba had been taking some pretty good falls in Maine. One almost took him off trail but he recovered ok.  They were planning on getting married on the top of Katahdin but there wasn't anyone ordained on the top that could do it.  They were planning on moving back to Austin for a little bit so we'll definitely get to hang out with them again.  Their plan was to finish on October 31st in Unionville, NY.  They had been getting stopped by every NOBO going north.  It seemed that they might need more time.  I said goodbye to them but would see them soon.  I pushed onto the next shelter for a quick snack since my body was telling me ""feed me!"".  I kept going then hit the ascent up Moody mountain.  It was steep but there was a lot of rock steps.  I climbed over that mountain in an hour and 40 minutes.  At the next gap I took a quick break to eat more.  Then it was another climb up old blue.  That mountain was twice as tall as Moody but it wasn't as steep.  I tried pushing harder but my legs couldn't go any faster.  The thought on my mind was to get to the shelter before it started really raining.  Once I got over old blue it was easier terrain to the shelter.  There were more climbs but I had done the two biggest today.  
About a mile from the shelter I could smell a fire.  I was excited to have one since it's been so cold.  When I arrived Bullet, Sonny, Maga, and Grape were there!  I hadn't seen Bullet and Sonny in awhile.  I caught up with them on all the things that happened over the last month.  They had broken off from Tree Beard and had done their own thing.  I met Grape for the first time.  Maga and her had been hiking together for a little while.  She was sectioning and planning on only going to Stratton, ME.  The fire was really warm and I made my ramen dinner next to it.  It started sprinkling a little bit and the storm had finally come it.  I quickly ate my food and got into the shelter.  We all were sleeping in the shelter like happy sardines.  I was excited to have a shelter from the incoming storm.

The trail was wet today after last night's rain.  It seemed that we were in Vermont again with all the mud.  We were doing a lot of rock hopping to avoid soaking our feet.  My shoes did get wet little by little as I walked on the sides of the trail hitting shrubs and grasses.  At one point Grape completely stepped in a mud puddle.  I almost stepped in a few times.  The roots were the trickiest since now they were wet.  It was easier to slip on them and fall.  Most of our descents were filled with roots and it was slow going.  We came to a river that we had to ford.  Maga and Grape walked right through but I put on my Crocs since I didn't want my shoes wet for the rest of the day.  The stream was pretty powerful in some deep spots as I walked on rocks under the water.  I made it across and put my shoes back on.  I was starving and ate most of my snacks.  Grape had pushed on and Maga did some laundry in the river.  Maga and I pushed up the hill to find Grape hanging out on a bench near the highway.  There was a view of a massive lake with an island in the middle.  I talked about taking a zero and hanging out on that island.  
Maga and Grape were ahead of me and I took my time on the rest of the trail.  Most of the time spent was avoiding mud pits and falling into bogs.  I arrived at the little swift river campsite to find Grape on a canoe in the lake.  This campsite came with its own canoes!  Grape came back to shore and we took a paddle on the lake.  On the other side was a huge beaver home.  We wondered if a beaver built the lake.  Back at shore Maga took the canoe for a spin.  I kept thinking about the movie Pokahantas for some reason.  We setup camp and then foraged for firewood.  Using Birch bark we were able to easily light wet wood.  We had a large fire going in 10 minutes.  I made some more ramen for dinner and dried out my feet.  Maga and Grape both dried out their pruned feet from the river ford earlier.  The stars made their appearance after overcast all day.  The time rolled around 10 pm and I stumbled off to bed.  At camp I found two slugs on my hiking shoes.

The trek was pretty easy since it was a gradual downhill.  The was still roots and bogs to contend with.  When I got to the access road to Rangely, ME I walked .3 miles west to the hiker hut hostel to pick up a resupply package from Theresa.  The hiker hut was off the grid and used solar energy to power the lights and shower.  There were a couple hikers there.  One that I recognized from Virginia that would never stop talking.  It was the same at the hostel.  He wouldn't stop and it seemed that it was always a one sided conversation.  I got my package and waited for the hiker shuttle to go to the laundromat.  The shuttle took awhile so the owner took us in his car.  He gave me some soap to use as well.  I did my laundry and then got a hitch to town.  An older woman picked me up.  She had picked up several hikers over the last few days.  She dropped me off at Sarge's so I could grab a bite to eat.  I got a salad with steak and a large Baxter IPA.  After lunch I headed over to the convenience store for snacks and toilet paper.   I walked back to the pub and a woman offered me a ride back to the trail for $10.  I said I would look for a hitch.  She dropped me off at IGA anyways. From IGA I got another hitch back to the trail.  The driver talked about how all the moose were dieing off because of ticks.  There used to be several in the area but he hadn't seen many recently.
Back at the trail I had to hike another 3 miles to where Maga and Grape were camping.  They mentioned I would come to a dirt road then I would need to hike .2 to their spot.  About 2 miles in the sky darkened as it approached 8 pm.  The trail was not forgiving as I climbed root staircases up steep terrain.  I came to a campsite with 8 hikers huddled around a campfire.  They told me the road was just up the way.  At the road I walked west and saw a fire.  It was Maga and Grape.  They had made their own stealth spot in the forest.  Grape showed me the spot.  Walked through a dense wall of trees to 3 flat pads for camping.  They had cleared a spot for me.  I setup my tent and then joined them at the fire.  I made beef stroganoff for dinner.  We listened to a few classic rock songs on my phone.  The time rolled around 9 pm, the music stopped, and it was time to return to the woods.

Grape and Maga headed out and I took it slow.  I got my pack together but trying to hike with the stomach pain was unbearable. I sat on a rock hunched over trying to escape the pain.  Around 10 am the pain subsided enough that I could start hiking.  I could still feel the shooting pains in my stomach as I climbed.  It seemed to be less and less painful as I climbed up.  At one point I felt a tweak in my stomach and the pain was gone.  Maybe something was stuck in my stomach and it finally broke free.  
The climb up Saddleback wasn't so bad.  I thought it was going to be mostly root climbs but it was more gradual than that.  I hiked above the Alpine zone and the trees shortened so I could see the valley below.  Rangely, ME could be seen in the distance with its massive lake that was carved as the glaciers from the last ice age retreated.    At the top of Saddleback I ran into Sunny and Bullet taking pictures.  They had gotten stuck in town yesterday and didn't make it very far.  I hung out there for awhile admiring the view and watching the clouds dance in the sky.  HAM, Rolly, and Fungi showed up.  I called Kazi since she had just summited Katahdin yesterday.  She was said it was a very emotional day for her since she completed the trail on her late fiance's anniversary.  She was now in Bangor with Brittany, Matt's sister.  They were getting food and were going to chill for the rest of the day.  I got off the phone and called Theresa for a little bit to catch up.  Around 1 pm I descended Saddleback and headed for the horn.  I could see the trail leading up to the horn about 1.7 miles out.  It had its own challenges with steep slick rocks and boulder climbs.  At the top of the horn I took a small break to get some calories in my system.  The descent off the horn was a little more sketchy.  At one point I had to do a hair point turn on a ledge where you could easily fall down 10 feet.  I made it to the bottom of the mountain to a campsite.  I grabbed some water and ran into HAM and Rolly again.  They were flipping a coin to see if they should stay at the campsite.  The coin told them yes and they were stopping for the day.  
I pushed up Saddleback junior to another excellent view and another snack break.  I climbed off the mountain and stopped at the Poplar Ridge Lean-To.  In the shelter was a small memorial for a hiker named Inchworm who had passed away a few miles from the shelter.  She had gone into the dense woods to use the bathroom had gotten lost in the forest.  She had tried climbing a few peaks to get cell phone reception but didn't get any.  She survived for a month and eventually died of starvation only a mile off trail.  A hunter found her remains a few years later.  As I hiked on from the shelter I looked into the forest to see how easy it could be to lose the trail.  The forest here is a lot denser than anywhere else on the trail.  At the bottom of the descent I ran into a large river where I had to rock hop and balance on logs to not get my feet wet.  On the other side was a waterfall and a dirt road at the top of the falls.  A whole group of hikers were camped out there.  It was the same group I saw the night before.  They said Maga and Grape pushed on from here a few hours ago.  It was getting dark and I decided to setup camp at the falls.  The group had a fire going and I made my dinner next to the fire.  I ate chili Mac for dinner.  We talked about Inchworm and the Maine hermit.  Thumper mentioned that Inchworm got lost right around here.  Through the trees we could see the stars.  They are brighter here with less artificial light.  I finished my food and headed to bed.

It was a steady climb up from the campsite.  Then it leveled off for two miles until I got to the shelter.  Maga and Grape were there hanging out and eating snacks.  There was the book Oh the places you'll go by Dr. Suess.  I read the whole book out loud to Maga and Grape.  I told Grape that Hopper was looking for her.  She was trying to avoid him since he's been trying to follow her for the past few days.  We left the shelter and I had to grab some water.  There was another easy climb up Spaulding Mountain.  On the way down to Carrabassette river was another story.  It was basically boulders on some parts.  I banged my knee into a rock but luckily it wasn't too hard.  It took me an hour and a half to descend.  At the bottom I found Maga and Grape hanging out by the river.  They were enjoying the cold water in the sun.  I took a bath in the river.  It was pretty cold but I needed one after a week of not showering.  
From the river we hiked a mile up to campsite before Crocker Mountain.  There were a few hikers already there but a lot of camping spots.  My spot had a dead tree next to it that I managed to push over.  It left the top part hanging in a tree though and I didn't want it to fall on me in the night.  I setup my tent in a safer spot.  Maga pulled rocks from the river and built a fire pit.  He had a fire going in about 5 minutes.  I built a seat from the tree I knocked down.  We hung out by the fire listening to Fleetwood Mac and a few other classic songs.  I ate two dinners tonight since I was pretty hungry.  We watched cowboy TV into the night.  I gave Theresa a call to catch up.  She sent me pictures of dogs she was thinking about fostering.  There might be a dog in the house when I get back!

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603110,"Last night I heard my plastic cup making noise.  I realized that my cup was in my food bag.  I shined my light on my bag and a mouse ran out of my bag and up the paracord line.  It was the first time a mouse got into my bag from my bear hang.  I checked the damage.  He had eaten into my chip snack bag and gotten my combos.  I took my bag down and brought it into my tent for safe keeping.  The mouse didn't come back.  In the morning, Maga and Grape packed up early.  I joined them near where the fire pit was.  Maga had moved all the stones back into the river.  I ate some poptarts for breakfast and then headed out.
From the campsite it was a 1.2 mile climb to South Crocker Mountain.  It was pretty steep but I didn't have to grab on any roots to help myself climb.  At the top was a small view.  I made my way to North Crocker Mountain to find Grape admiring the view.  There was a cloud ocean in the distance.  We waited for Maga but he didn't show.  We figured he passed us at some point.  I talked to Grape about her last year in medical school.  She was going to become a family medicine doctor.  She would need to go through 3 years of residency first before coming a doctor though.  We pushed on from the cloud ocean and then descended down the mountain.  Maga was waiting in the forest near the 2000 mile marker!  I can't believe I had walked 2000 miles.  There were only 190 miles left to go.  We got a few pictures near the sign.  Mayday showed up and helped us take a picture of all 3 of us.  We hiked down to the road to get a ride into Stratton, ME.
At the gap we hitched into town.  The driver told us to get lunch at the plaza in town.  The town had more options than Andover and had a small grocery store to resupply.  We went to the plaza and got lunch.  I ate a Philly cheese steak sandwich with sweet potato fries.  Maga got a 16 inch pizza for himself.  We played ping pong and table hockey while we waited for our food.  Today was the last day Grape would be on the trail.  She was sectioning up to this town and was getting a shuttle to Boston to fly back home.  We ate our food then played some corn hole.  Maga was pretty good at all the games.  We walked over to the grocery store to grab our resupply.  Fotters market had everything a hiker needed.  I also got brats to pack out of town tonight.  I said goodbye to Grape.  Sometimes you don't know if you'll see someone again, but that's life on the trail.  Maga and I waited outside the grocery store.  A church van pulled up asking if we needed a ride back to the trail.  We got on board and got a ride back.  Back at the gap the woman gave us popsicles and they were on their way.  Maga and I hiked 2 miles to the campsite to find a few hikers already their with a fire going.  I setup camp then collected some wood for the fire.  Maga and I sharpened sticks and cooked brats on the fire.  They were so tasty.  I felt sleepy around 8 pm and headed off to bed.  I got a text from Theresa showing a dog in our house.  She had fostered a dog named TJ.  He was really tired since he had been in the animal shelter for 3 months.  I started passing out and went to bed.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603112,"This morning I awoke to the sound of cracking sticks.  Someone was rebuilding the fire this morning.  I got out of my tent and packed up my stuff.  Maga was starting to cook eggs and toast bagels near the fire.  His breakfast made my poptarts and coffee look sad.  Gear Head and Mira were up hanging out near the fire.   I finished my breakfast and headed out with Maga.  
It was a slow long climb up to South horn.  I started sweating a lot and could feel shirt becoming saturated.  Maga was feeling sad today because Grape had got off trail because she went back to school.  I could see that he had slowed his pace a bit more than normal.  The hike was also coming closer to an end.  We hiked up the first horn and was greeted with a spectacular view of of the valley below.  There was a large lake that seemed completely void of people. You could have that lake to yourself if you wanted.  We hiked down one horn then up another.  Then down again and up to Bigelow mountain.  It got rockier as we summited Bigelow.  We ate lunch at the top and watched the clouds make shadows on the valley below. It seemed that the clouds were stuck in the sky and hardly moved.  The next peak was Avery mountain named after Myron Avery who was instrumental in creating the Appalachian Trail.  Maga and I joked that he used the CCC to create his own mountain for himself.  He wanted to make the hardest climb on the AT by smoothing the rocks and teaching the rodents to steal all your food.  We climbed down Avery and came to Stafford Notch Campsite.  With only 8.5 miles today we were spent and ready to setup camp.  
At the campsite I ran into Truck who had flip flopped to beat the weather at Katahdin.  I found a spot and setup camp.  When I came back Maga had a fire going.  I toasted bagels on the fire and made sandwiches.  I also ate rice with broccoli and cheese.  I could have kept eating but I decided to save some food for tomorrow.  I talked to Maga about pushing ahead tomorrow.  We will probably split up because I'm planning on finishing sooner than him.  I want to get back to Theresa before the end of the month. The fire died down and it was time for bed.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603381,"Last night mice were trying to get into my tent.  They wanted my food and kept jumping into the side of the tent.  It seemed that they came back every 10 minutes.  I setup a trap for them with a plastic bag and food.  When I heard the bag crackling I tried to hit it with my shoe.  The mice always got away.  In the morning I wasn't well rested.  I packed up and ate poptarts for breakfast.  Maga and I headed out around 8 am.
The terrain for today was totally different than southern Maine.  It was flatter and there wasn't any steep climbs.  The only thing to contend with was still roots, rocks, and mud.   The first climb was easy and we made it to the valley.  I was hiking at cruising speed since it was so flat.  Maga and I hiked together for part of the day.  I got to a road gap and exchanged my hiking shoes for my Crocs.  My hiking shoes had been wearing down.  Hiking in Crocs was a bit different than shoes.  They were softer and didn't provide much support.  The cush did relieve the ball of my foot though.  I ran into Mayday who did a 7 mile hike for a resupply.  He seemed a little out of it after doing that many sideway miles.  We stopped at Flagstaff campsite for a quick dip in the pond.  The water was cold and warm in some spots.  Maga took a bath after in the pond using Dr. Bronners.  Maga and I pushed onto West Carry Pond Shelter.  Maga decided to stay at the shelter since he was doing low mile days all the way to Katahdin. I had Theresa motivation and needed to push on.  It would mean that I wouldn't see him again on trail.  We both wrote a goodbye to each other in the shelter log.  I gave Maga a fist bump and I was on my way.  
I hiked another 3.7 miles to a stealth spot near East Carry Pond.  At the beach Georgia Peach was hanging out.  We watched a few fishermen in the pond.  Georgia Peach was going to night hike to Pierce Pond right before the Kennebec River.  I stopped at a stealth site on East Carry Pond.  Opie was there with a fire already going.  I'm glad I didn't have to start one.  I setup and ate a dehydrated meal.  Opie and I talked about old video games.  We also talked about hikers setting hard finish dates and those dates forcing them to constantly worry about finishing on time.  The fire burned out and it was time for bed.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603383,"I woke up early this morning to make the 10 mile hike to the Kennebec river.  Luckily my bear bag hang wasn't attacked my mice or chipmunks.  Opie was still in his tent when I packed up.  I ate a poptart and had coffee.  I was running out of food but luckily I'll be resupplying in Caratunk.  
The hike today didn't have any real climbs.  There was still plenty of rocks, roots, and mud to contend with.  I was still able to make a pretty good pace even with all the obstacles.  I stopped at the Pierce Pond Lean-to.  It was right on the pond and had great access to it.  I hiked a little further and saw an old wooden sign that said Harrison's.  It was a hunting lodge that catered to hikers as well.  It was the place that had a pancake breakfast if you stayed at Pierce Pond.  From a distance it looked like an old cabin where nature had been taking it over.  I hiked on and found Bear Claw climbing down a steep hill to take a picture of a waterfall.  She had taken a zero and I had caught up to her again even with all my low mile days.  We hiked on together and came to the Kennebec River.  I could see Opie and the ferry on the other side.  The ferryman came across the river and gave us life jackets.  I was in the front, Bear Claw was in the middle, and the ferryman was in the back.  The ferryman and I rowed across the river to the other side.  The river looked shallow enough to ford.  The reason for the ferry is that there's a dam upstream that releases water during the day.  The river can rise rapidly and you could get swept away.  One person had died this year trying to ford the river.  On the other side we hiked a quarter mile to Caratunk B&B.
The B&B was the only place in town that had a resupply.  The people who ran it were really friendly and didn't try to rip you off on resupply food.  They had pulled pork sandwiches and milkshakes.  I had both and they really hit the spot.  I stopped at the post office to pick up my resupply package from Theresa.  It had lots of protein bars and dinners.  My food bag was heavy again but it will get me to Monson.  While I was hanging out, Scooter rolled in.  He looked exhausted and apparently went down the wrong road for about 30 minutes.  He also had developed a nasty rash between his legs from sweating so much.  He took a shower at the B&B and decided to stay and recover.  I left Caratunk around 4:15 pm to make it to a shelter about 5 miles away.  It was a gradual climb all the way there.  It seemed really hot outside but then cool air hit me.  A rain storm was coming in.  It started raining and then harder.  The rain was cold and I put on my rain gear.  The roots, rocks, and mud had gotten a challenge multiplier.  I tried to avoid all of them.  I arrived at the shelter a bit wet but luckily there was space in the shelter.  Bear Claw was there as well as a couple who had hiked the trail in 1991.  They explained that ultralighters didn't exist back then.  All their packs were heavy.  The typical average time to finish the trail was still 6 months back then.  I wonder if we have just gotten weaker?  Our packs probably weighed at least half of what theirs weighed back then.  I made some meat pasta for dinner and ate lots of snacks.  I was starving.  After dinner I curled up into my sleeping bag.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603386,"It was cold out this morning and everything was still damp from the night before.  Bear Claw and I didn't feel like getting up early.  We got up around 8 am.  I ate poptarts and oatmeal for breakfast.  Luckily I was able to keep the oatmeal down.  We were planning on an 18 mile day but with our late start we might only go 14.  
The shelter was right at the base of pleasant pond mountain.  The ascent was pretty easy but there wasn't much to view with all the cloud cover.  The descent took awhile since all the roots were wet from the day before.  Scooter caught up to me as I was descending.  He had stayed at the hostel in Caratunk the night before.  His rash had healed up pretty nicely.  He was bummed that a lot of his friends had jumped up to Monson and he probably wouldn't see them again.  He was planning on doing large mile days until Katahdin.  We stopped for a lunch break.  Eventually Bear Claw caught up with us.  I told her that I was only going to go to the Moxie Bald Mountain Lean-to in about 12 miles.  I didn't want to setup in the rain.  We all pushed onto Moxie mountain.
As I was hiking I saw Scooter coming the wrong way.  He had turned the wrong way coming from the privy.  I pointed him in the right direction.  The climb up Moxie was mostly slanted rock except close to the top where it became boulder and root climbs.  It had started drizzling near the top.  My pack and I started to get soaked and I put on my rain gear.  At the top I couldn't see anything.  It was all cloud cover.  I made my way down Moxie as it started drizzling harder.  At the bottom of the mountain was the Lean-to.  Luckily there was 2 spots left for Bear Claw and l.  Everyone was in their sleeping bags at 6:30 pm.   Maybe they were planning on getting up at 3 am?  A hiker named Blue Diamond was there.  I hadn't seen him in 5 and a half months.  It's strange how you'll re-meet tons of people near the end.  I made chili n cheese for dinner making sure not to wake anyone.    I guess they all needed to crush miles.  I got ready for bed and climbed into my sleeping bag.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603388,"My body kept scooting towards the shelter edge in the middle of the night.  The boards in the shelter were at an angle and the blood rushed to my head.  I still slept ok in that position.  I heard someone rummaging through the food sacks at 6 am.  It was Spot!  I hadn't seen him since Bear mountain in New York. He was still going strong on his thru hike at 68 years old.  We talked about the upcoming 100 mile wilderness and the possibility to resupply in it.  He was happy to see me still trekking on the trail.  I had some more coffee and poptarts for breakfast.  Plenty of sugar for my 18 mile day.  I packed up and headed out around 9 am.
The elevation profile today looked flat but I knew that was deceiving.  The trail followed the Piscataquis river for miles.  It would follow the river then go up 200 feet then back to the river over and over.  It felt like a mini rollercoaster.  At one point I had to ford the river but luckily the rivers had been low enough that I could rock hop across.  I did manage to toe dip my shoes in though.  With a wet shoe I stopped at the next shelter to eat lunch.  Spot was there setting up his tent.  He said that if they did move the northern terminus from Katahdin then the trail should end in obscurity.  Maybe like a dirt road or a dead end.  Springer mountain wasn't that grand and the trail would be more about the journey rather than the goal.  I ate lunch then pushed on another 9 miles.  There was another river ford but I managed not to get my shoes wet.  At a road crossing a a truck slowed down and stopped.  His name was Richard and he talked to me for awhile about the state of Maine.  He told me that the state was ran by a bunch of Republicans that controlled everything.  He mentioned that a family started living in the Maine woods and people in the area thought they were crazy.  They decided to hike the Appalachian trail south then ended up in the jungles in Hawaii.  The time was getting late and I needed to move on before it got dark.  The remaining 5 miles was a climb up to the road to Monson, ME. 
At the trailhead Bear Claw and her family were there.  I was happy to see them.  They shared some food with me and drove me into town.  I was thankful for the ride.  At the Lakeshore hostel I ran into Sunnyside and Bullet.  I asked them if they wanted to form a tramily since everyone had pushed ahead.  At the bar I ordered pot roast.  It really hit the spot.   In the bunkhouse I ran into Magic who had just resupplied.  He was leaving tomorrow for the 100 mile wilderness.  He was going into Chicago after he summits Katahdin.  I gave him some recommendations for places to go in that city.  We talked until 10 pm then it was time for bed.

I went back to the hostel to relax.  I put on the movie the mask on VHS and watched the rain come down outside.  It was coming down harder and harder.  I was glad that I took a zero today.  Around 4 pm I headed downstairs to the bar and got the fish fry.  The bar filled up with hikers and locals.  It was so crammed that they sat an older couple at my table.  They had lived in the area for over 30 years.  They also talked about how conservative the county was.  Monson used to be mined for slate but the mines had run dry.  There were a few other industries but that had all closed down.  It was harder for the younger generation to live in the town since there wasn't work.  They talked about how bad the black flies, mosquitos, and noseeums were in June and July.  There used to be a large bat population that ate them but most had been killed of by the white nose disease.  The bug population had gotten worse since then.  The older gentleman talked about getting a permit to hut moose.   He had won the lottery this year for one.  I couldn't imagine how much meat that would bring in.  Sunnyside, Bullet, and Blaze showed up.  They were getting dinner and drinks.  The bar was super crowded at this point.  Sunnyside and Bullet were going to head out tomorrow and planned on doing 15 miles the first day.  It seemed like a lot with all that food but I was up for the challenge.  Rebel Yell walked into the bar who I hadn't seen since Hanover, NH.  He was still in good spirits after hiking 22 miles in the rain today.

Back at the trailhead my pack weighed like a boulder.  It was really heavy to carry.  Once it was on my back though I could carry it.  I felt the weight shift around in the pack as I hiked.  I hadn't even hit the hard the climbs in the 100 mile wilderness yet.  The rocks had changed in this area to slate.  They were slicker than the previous rocks.  With a heavy pack I went slow over the roots and rocks since it felt easier to fall.  I came to the first shelter and left a journal entry for Maga.  It contained the lyrics to the Whitesnake song Here I Go Again.  I pushed on another 6 miles and came to Big Wilson Stream.  There were no rocks to hop across and I had to ford the river.  The water came up to my knees as I walked across.  The rocks in the water were covered in green slime and were really slick.  I made it across without falling in.  On the other side it was a mile to the shelter.  
At the shelter there were about 7 or 8 people camping out back.  The shelter had a couple people in it.  The tenting spots were not great and I took one that had a couple roots and rocks.  I setup then ate my dinner next to the shelter.  The one hiker was a massage therapist.  She had to keep that on the DL since people would always ask her for massages.  I ate a pasta dinner and made some tea.  The sun went down and it instantly got cold.  It's supposed to be in the 30s tonight.  I walked back down to my tent and went to bed.

I joined them and made breakfast.  Maverick also didn't want to get out of his sleeping bag.  I made coffee and oatmeal. The oatmeal bag warmed my hands as I ate out of it.  I was pretty lazy and didn't get out of camp until 10 am.  
My pack was still really heavy from all the food I had been carrying.  I packed some food at the bottom of my pack to even out the weight.  I hiked up Barren mountain and it was a struggle up the 2000 foot elevation climb.  I had to readjust my shoulder straps to keep them from digging into my shoulders.  I got to the first shelter and took a snack break then headed up the mountain.  On the way up I ran into some jars with trail magic!  There were candy bars, chips, and first aid supplies.  I was surprised to see trail magic this deep in the woods.  I kept pushing up the mountain.  There was some rocky parts but the terrain wasn't awful.  At the top I met a day hiker who worked a summer job in Greenville, ME.  She lived in her parent's cabin in the area but wasn't sticking around for winter.  She had been climbing mountains in the region and had explored most of them.  She was planning on working at a ski resort in Colorado when she leaves Maine.  On the way home to Georgia she is going to stop in Akron Ohio, my home town, to visit her family.  She was really excited to eat Swensons there.  It was a local burger joint in Akron.

The climb down the chair backs was steep. There was a rock slide to traverse. It took me awhile to get down the mountain.  At the bottom it was pretty much flat for a few miles until I got to Pleasant river.  I didn't see a way across without getting my shoes wet.  I changed into my Crocs and forded the river.  I was warm before I crossed but the water made me cold again.   After the river it was 5 miles to the shelter before the white mountain range.  I filled up my water at the shelter then headed up into the range.  My pack was extra heavy with the water and all the food.  I wore my fleece sweeter at the beginning but soon removed it when I started sweating.  I gave Theresa a call for her birthday.  She had gotten my flowers and my email.  I was glad she enjoyed my present.  I wish I could have been with her for her birthday.  Me coming home will be her birthday present.

The trail up white cap mountain was not so bad except my hands were freezing with all the cold wind.  I got to the top and was almost taken off my feet.  It felt like the wind was blowing 50 mph.  It was clear though and I could see for miles.  The sky was golden with lakes dotting the landscape.  Cloud oceans took their place in the distance.  I almost got blown over while trying to take a picture.  On the other side I could see Katahdin!  It seemed like the mountain was so close but I still had another 70 miles to go.  The mountain range seemed to stand alone in the middle of forest.  I hiked down to the shelter to grab water.  It was still really windy at the shelter and I rushed to grab water.  I hiked out of there pretty quick.  Down the rest of the mountain was pretty gradual and didn't seem to hard.  It was flat for a little while then I came to Little Broadman mountain.  The climb wasn't that difficult.  At the top I could see the storm clouds rolling in and had to book it to the next shelter.  The trail got really flat and I enjoyed the change of pace.  At one section I ran into a group of trail maintainers.  They were replacing the bog boards.  They had to haul all the wood until the forest.  They gave me an apple and I was on my way.
At the shelter Rebel Yell was hanging out.  He said he couldn't get wet since he had only one pair of clothes.  He was stopping early because of the rain.  A few other hikers showed and wanted to use the shelter.  They had hiked a considerable distance before the white cap range.  I built a fire since I hadn't had one in a little while.  I was also at the shelter at 2 pm and really wanted to eat.  The fire was built before most of the rain.  We talked about the end of the trail and what we would be doing afterwards.  It's hard to imagine that it's almost over but I feel that I'm ready for it to end.  I cooked up some chili and rice for dinner.  Then got cozy into bed.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603859,"It rained all last night but luckily the rain had stopped in the morning.  A hiker talked about playing Mario party 64 in the shelter.   If we did, no one would make it anywhere that day.  As usual I was the last one to leave the shelter but I did love having it to myself.  The shelter had a beautiful waterfall in front of it.  I ate my oatmeal and drank some coffee.  I had to do some pack maintenance.  I left the shelter around 9 am.  
The trek was pretty flat the 15 miles I was going to hike today.  There were a couple hills but nothing much.  I was planning on stopping at the shelter.  After hiking for an hour I decide to stay at White House Landing.  At Jo Mary road I had service to message Bill and Linda to book a reservation.  They said I needed to be there before 5 pm for dinner.  It was 11 am and I still needed to go 10 miles but it was an easy hike.  I met a hiker there named Overhill who had been having knee issues.  I let him use my phone so he could call a shuttle from Millinocket to pick him up.  I pushed onto the next shelter.  A hiker named Traveler was there who had been feeling sick.  He was hoping to get a ride into town from White House Landing.  We hiked on to the dock where you could get a boat ride to the hostel.  I texted Bill and explained the situation with Traveler.  He said Traveler couldn't stay there because the hostel was at capacity but knew someone in town who shuttled.  Bill showed up in a motor boat and taxied us across the lake.  We zoomed around large boulders in the water and it felt great to be flying across the water.  
At White House Landing, it was a hostel that was off the grid.  Everything was ran on propane.  Even the lighting used propane.  On the front porch I ran into the Snooze Crew which was Reggie, Charms, and Sticks.  They had gotten in a few hours earlier.  Dinner started at 5 pm and I quickly  hand washed my hiking clothes and took a shower.  At dinner Bill and Linda cooked pizza and hamburgers.  It was a little pricey but I got a hamburger and a Budweiser.  It was better than the food I had been eating over the past 5 days.  We learned that a hiker named Gandalf had a reservation in Baxter state park for Saturday that he wasn't going to use.  We all jumped on that instead of trying to fight for space in The Birches.  It was a nice little trail magic.  We watched as the storm rolled in over the lake.  The wind picked up and the gas lighting flickered with each gust.  It created an eerie atmosphere.  After dinner I handed my phone over to Linda to charge overnight.  The Snooze Crew and I went to the dock to hang out on the water.  There was a warm breeze and the rain hadn't started yet.  At 7:30 pm we went back to the bunk house and played Egyptian rat screw.  I was super tired and didn't last long.  It was time for bed.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603860,"I was awoken last night by someone hacking and coughing at midnight.  It sounded like they were getting sick.  They kept me up for a little while but then I went back to sleep.  I had to wake up early this morning since breakfast was at 7:15 am.  I packed up my stuff and headed to the main house for coffee, eggs, bacon, English muffins, and ayce pancakes.  The rain clouds had cleared overnight and we were left with blue skies overlooking a blue lake.  It was definitely a  magical place. After breakfast, Bill shuttled us across the lake back to the trail.  
We had another 15 miles to do today until the shelter.  It was pretty flat except one 700 foot climb.  The trail did have the usual Maine ruggedness, but it wasn't that hard.  I did slip a few times on roots.  We came to a beach that had mountains on either side.  The trees had been changing to yellows and reds.  Fall was well on its way.  We stared out at the view for a little while then moved on.  At the top of the 700 foot climb we could see Katahdin in the distance.  Even though it was 16 miles away we still had over 30 trail miles left.  The 100 mile wilderness doesn't go in a straight line to Katahdin but in an S shape.  Sometimes you're even going south on a trail.  We stopped at a shelter to eat lunch.  Reggie, Sticks, and Charms all had leftover pizza to eat.  I wished I got pizza last night to pack out.  I just had some lousy tortillas and peanut butter.  It was another 8 miles to the next shelter.  On the way we found several canoes tied up near a lake but there wasn't any oars.  Sadly we pushed on.  
At the Rainbow Stream Shelter Charms gathered wood to build a fire.  I helped collect wood from across the stream.  The shelter sat right in front of a wide stream with a good water source.  I setup my tent then headed back down to the shelter to cook dinner.  Charms got the fire going and everyone showed up to eat around it.  There were several hikers there who stayed at White House Landing the night before.  We all ate our dinners watching cowboy TV.  Reggie talked about seeing everyone's posts about summiting.  We were very close to doing the same thing ourselves.  The shelter log book was filled with hiker's last thoughts about ending the hike.  Some were ready for it to end others were not.  At the beginning of the hike it never seemed that anyone put any real thought into the shelter log entries.  Now at the end everything was coming out.  I finished my dinner and hung out by the for a bit.  Charms built the fire larger then snuck into his sleeping bag for the night.  It was time.
Tonight I'm thinking about how close we are to ending this adventure.","White House Landing

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603861,"When I woke up it was cool again.  The air chilled overnight.  I packed up my tent and walked down to the shelter to make breakfast.  Charms was still sleeping in his sleeping bag.  I boiled water for my oatmeal and coffee.  Another hiker came down with a bundle of sticks to start a morning fire.  I was all for it.  We hung out around the fire until 9 am then headed out. 
It was another easy 15 miles to Abol bridge with flat in between.  We stopped at a pond for lunch and watched a prop plane fly over the lake.  The plane could land on water.  We went another six miles to rainbow cliffs and saw Katahdin up closer.  I texted Theresa that I was still alive.  She appreciated it.  I hiked another 6 miles to the golden road.  It was a dirt road with gravel.  While walking over the bridge I got an amazing view of Katahdin with the trees  and the river.  There was a convenience store and restaurant. They also ran the campsite behind it.  I paid for a camping spot with Charm's dad.  It included free breakfast.  Charm's dad Jim rolled into the campsite while we were all setting up.  He was retired and used to be a car salesman.  Good wood and Toasty showed up.  They had just summited today and were super stoked.  They were excited for us to summit on Sunday and said it was an amazing experience for them.  We all got dinner at the restaurant.  It was the last night the restaurant was open for the season.  I got a steak and cheese sandwich with homemade potato salad with a large Baxter IPA.  
Back at the campsite a number of thru hikers showed up to hang out.  We built a fire since the temperature was dropping.  A older man talked about what it takes to be a thru hiker.  We all understood exactly what he meant.  We all drank beers and partied late (9:45 pm) is late for hikers.  We were a bit rowdy and were asked to quiet down.  I was a bit sleepy myself and decided to go to bed.

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603862,"This morning I had a hangover from the night before.  The several Baxter IPAs did it.  It was slow going in the morning.  I did manage to get up for the included breakfast with the camp stay.  It was basically the same kind of breakfast that Quality Inn had.  At least the biscuits and gravy were not bad.  Charms, Sticks, Reggie, and I packed up.  There was plenty of leftover beer from last night and we decided to take it into the park.  We packed out cups to conceal alcohol in Baxter state park.  
We got a late start and headed out at 10 pm.  The trail was really flat today and was basically a road right into the park.  At the park's boundary we registered at the kiosk so they knew we were in the park.  We walked and drank for most of the day. At noon we found a large rock in the river to sit on for lunch.  I ate my sandwich that I bought from Abol bridge.  We watched people across the river shoot off fireworks mid day.  Charms would let out a huge yell as they went off.  An older gentleman showed up and asked us a few questions about our trip.  He had gone canoeing the other day and forgot his clothes on the banks of the river.  He was going to swim to get them.  We wished him good luck and pushed on to Katahdin Stream Campground.  
At the campground Jim was at site #7.  The lean-to was super small and only fit 4 people.  Luckily we also had site #9 that Mozy and Bean were using.  I setup my sleeping bag in #9 and went back over to #7 to hang out.  We got our Katahdin hiking permits at the ranger station.  It was easy and really straight forward.  I looked through the log book to see all the hikers who had finished already.  There was Scissors, Booger Bear, Giggles, Scatter, and much more.  I went back over to the lean-to   to make dinner.  Reggie had built a fire and I was happy to have one.  We were all super excited to summit tomorrow.  I couldn't believe this adventure was coming to a close but it has been a long 6 months on the trail.  It was 8 pm and we decided to go to bed since we would be getting up early for the big climb.
Tonight I'm thinking about finishing this tomorrow.","Abol Pines Campsite

Uncle Ya,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603865,"I woke up at 5:30, it was freezing out.  Bean and Mozy got up as well.  I packed up my stuff and headed over to lean-to #7 to meet the Snooze Crew.  We all ate breakfast and headed out around 7:15 am.  Jim was going to meet us at Abol campground after we got down from the mountain.  He was slacking our gear since we were not going to be camping on the mountain tonight.  
The initial climb was pretty flat but it slowly got more and more steep.  We were flying though.  Since it was Sunday there were a lot of day hikers on the trail.  We would pass several of them going up.  We made it 2.2 miles up the mountain in an hour then took a drink break.  We started pushing again.  The rocks got larger and larger.  When we finally got above treeline there were massive boulders that we had to climb.  Mozy was sick and had vertigo.  He was so close to the top but decided to turn back since he felt so sick.  It must be really hard to make that decision.  We offered to hike with him but he wanted to go back down.  The boulder part of the climb was like Mahoosuc notch except it was a 25 percent grade up.  There were a few sections with metal posts that helped us climb up.  I scraped my knees a few times and they started bleeding.  I just let them go and kept pushing up.  Every 25 feet was a new puzzle to figure out how to climb.  I still felt like I could keep going with all the hiking experience behind me.  We came to a false summit then looked up at the ridgeline with more boulders.  
It was another half mile then we came to the table lands.  It was a large flat section that lead to the summit.  We came to Thoreau spring.  It bubbled up from a boulder and was unusual to see a spring on top of a mountain.  A sign said we were only one mile from the summit!  We could see tiny figures on the ridgeline where the Katahdin summit sign must have been.  We were all stoked and pushed to the top.  About 150 feet from the sign we could see a large group of people taking pictures next to the sign.  We got closer to the sign and couldn't believe it.  Reggie started shedding a few tears.  I couldn't believe I was finally here after 6 months of being on the trail.  Charms, Sticks, Reggie, and I all touched the sign at the same time.  It was finally over!  It felt strange to finally be at the end, but I don't think it has hit me yet.  We all got our summit pictures with the sign.  I even got to do the Mouse King pose with Mouse King.  There were several other thru hikers at the top as well.  Mouse King, Baby Bird, Frolic, Toast, Blaze, Freak, Stretch, and many others were up there.  I sat on the other side of the ridge where you could see knife's edge.  It looked really gnarly with parts of the trail that fell 400 feet down if you walked off.  In the valley below was huge expanse of trees that were turning all sorts of yellows, oranges, and reds.  The mountain below was exploding with color.  I sat and just marveled at the landscape.  I couldn't believe I hiked over 2000 miles but it was worth it.  I had met amazing people on the trail who I shared this adventure with.  Through blood, sweat, tears, rain, boulders, steep climbs, and all the other things the trail threw at as.  It was through these challenges that we all became closer and relied on each other.  It couldn't have done with without my trail buddies.  My tramilies. My friends and family.  My partner in life Theresa.
