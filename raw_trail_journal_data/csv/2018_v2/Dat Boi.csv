Dat Boi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584922,"While researching the AT, one of the most consistent pieces of advice I saw coming from past thru-hikers was to have a clear rationale laid out concerning the motivations behind one's thru-hike before one even started. Having taken this advice to heart, and considering the extra hours I now have due to a poor weather delay, I figured it might interest some of you if I were to share my reasons for attempting this crazy trek. For the sake of brevity, I'll list them by bullet point: 

- Provide myself a challenge that will test me both physically and mentally. This is something I feel has been lacking in my life recently, especially since during my time in college. In short, I want to see what I'm made of. 
- Have a coming of age experience where I will gain skills and confidence that will leave me more independent then when I started. 
- Potentially recharge some mental batteries by experiencing nature and removing screens from my life. 
- Experience a sense of adventure where I try new things and live in a different way then before. 
These are the motivations I will use to keep me going when times get rough on the trail, as they inevitably will. I do hope, though, that I will also be open to what the trail has to teach me, even if it lies outside this particular list or contrasts with any of my prior expectations.
Happy Hiking!!","

Dat Boi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585518,"This is Cam's ghostwriter signing on with an update.  Cam reached Neel's Gap, Ga right on schedule.  He is enjoying himself.  He got rather wet white weather a strong storm on top of a mountain Thursday evening.  He has already encountered 'trail magic' where local folk leave out food and drinks for the thru-hikers.  He has also experienced the wonder of a trail-angel who washed his clothes and those of his compatriots as they slumbered in a cabin Friday night.  His goal is to reach the GA/NC border this week.  When this ghostwriter gets photos and notes from Cam, I will gladly share them with all of you.  Until next time, take care!","

Dat Boi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587203,"Currently in the town of Hiawassee GA about 69 miles into the trail (78 if you count the approach trail), so I'll be back in North Carolina in the next day or two. Been great so far with not to many big issues (although I nearly did get blown off the side of mountain by a HUGE thuderstorm the 4th night) so I'm looking forward to more.","

Dat Boi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587206,I'm currently in the town of Franklin NC about 110 miles into the trail taking a zero day. My phone decided to do a factory reset the other day and I've been unable to access it since lol so I'm coming to you from a computer terminal in an outdoor outfitter here (Outdoor 76). Looking to reach Fontana Dam in the next week or so at which point I'll be entering the smokies and the highest elevations of the trail. I'll also be getting a new phone at the NOC (Nantahala Outdoor Center) in 3 days so I'll have more pictures for you after that.,"

Just made it to the town of Hotsprings NC about 270 miles into the AT. Since the last post I’ve traversed the smokies as well as some other notable spots like Max’s patch (although for that last one weather was questionable, which is fine because the smokies treated me VERY well weather wise). Here are some pictures...","

Dat Boi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592093,"Currently around mile 426 as I exit Hampton Tennessee. It’s been awhile since I last posted from Hotsprings and a lot has transpired in that time but I’m happy to say I only have 45 miles or so until I reach Virginia, where I’ll be enjoying trail days this weekend (trail days is a festival held every year in Damascus VA where hikers celebrate the tradition and its different aspects such as gear and culture). Now, with all that said, here are some pics and videos from the last stretch. *NOTE: since I’ve already taken a lot of landscapes I’m trying to mix in some different fare like candids or videos to mix thing up*Here are links to some videos:  https://www.facebook.com/cameron.hill.773776/videos/1805112996212715/
