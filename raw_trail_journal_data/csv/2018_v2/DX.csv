So far so good, not too bad. But then again Im sitting in my chair at home vs out on the trail. Might be slightly different",,View Entry,"Nov 22, Wed",0
DX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580745,"Went hiking today with a group along the Florida Trail. Six total miles at a slow pace, nice morning for a hike but got warm toward the end. Hike was from the land bridge trailhead south of Ocala, out and back at the car by 1130.",,View Entry,"Nov 22, Wed",0
DX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581091,"Spur of the moment hike. Grabbed my backpack, which already had some gear and items in it, weighted in at 24 lbs, and headed to a near by trailhead for the Florida Trail. Overcast day with temps in the low 60s. Didn't see any other hikers but did see a bike rider and several horses with riders. This section of the FT intersects a bike/horse trail in several places. A couple of miles into the hike I noticed my pack weight was primary all on my shoulders. After adjusting the hip belt and tighten it around my waist the backpack felt a lot better. I have lost some weight since I last put on the pack and evidently enough that my hip belt was too loose now. I will have to look more at this as the hip belt is now as tight as it will go. My pack is a ULA Circuit and I ordered it with a large belt. Might need to order a medium size belt before the thru hike begins... All in all a good hike, total round trip was about 6.5 miles. I need to do a few more shakedown hikes over the next couple of months and add more weight to the pack next time. I will have a base weight around 25 lbs for the thruhike so for my next shakedown I'll get my pack weight up to about 35lbs.",,View Entry,"Dec 07, Thu",0
DX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581122,"Spur of the moment hike today along the Florida Trail. Super nice day for a hike, temps in the upper 50's, sunny with no wind. Hiked approx 6 miles out and back and it took me about 2 hours 10 minutes. Loaded my backpack with 31 lbs this time. Pack felt better than last hike but the hip belt was still a little loose. I'll be investing in a smaller hip belt soon. All in all an excellent hike and very glad I went.",,View Entry,"Dec 10, Sun",0
DX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581256,"Afternoon hike today along the Florida Trail with a hiker buddy of mine. Another nice day for a hike, temps in the upper 60's, partly cloudy with no wind. Hiked round trip approx 7 miles out and back and it took us about 2 hours 30 minutes. It was getting dusk when we got back to the car, glad we headed back when we did. Loaded my backpack with 32.5 lbs this time. I did order a medium hip belt from ULA to replace the large belt and received it in 4 days. Excellent service! When I replaced the belt on the backpack I noticed there was a hole in one of the belt pockets. My ULA circuit is about 4 years old so definitely glad I replaced the belt. Pack felt better with the smaller hip belt. Another good shakedown hike.",,View Entry,"Dec 16, Sat",0
DX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581416,"Another great day for a hike here in Central Florida. Partly cloudy and mid 70s to 80ish toward the end. It was getting hot during the last couple miles. I hiked north on the Florida Trail in the Ocala National Forest from Juniper Springs campground to Hidden Pond. Six miles one way, for a total of twelve miles for this hike. Total time on the trail was 4 hours 20 minutes. Didn't really stop much during the duration of the hike. I did see 3 groups of day hikers along the trail today, total of about ten people. A really cool thing happened on the second half of the hike. I heard a bird call and then saw two of the birds about 20 yards away in some low bushes. I did recognize the birds as the Florida Scrub Jays which are in the area. The Scrub Jay is an threatened species and is limited to only six counties in Florida. When I heard the birds, I used my bird call app and called them using the same calling I heard. The two birds were joined by a third bird and the trio flew within ten yards of me, looking for where my bird call was coming from. They hung around about 5 minutes, calling back and bouncing from bush to bush before they decided I was not one of them and flew away. Pretty cool experience.",,View Entry,"Dec 23, Sat",0
DX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581626,"After spending the day visiting a couple of friends I decided to swing by the REI store in Orlando. I had a few things in mind that I needed to pick up so this was a good opportunity. I don't get the chance to go in a store like REI too often so I was like a kid in a candy store. Walked around for a couple of hours and I do believe I looked at most of the hiker related gear I wanted to check out. I purchased: A Sea to Summit Thermolite Reactor sleeping bag liner to supplement the EE quilt for those cold nights I'm expecting in March and April. A pair of Merino Wool liner gloves and a wool buff. Also a pair of Prana Stretch Zion hiking pants. I needed a new pair of pants for this hike as my old pair, while still in good shape and functional, is a size too big for me presently. So I got a couple inches smaller pants and they do fit a whole lot better now!! I also wanted to get a Spot Gen3 satillite GPS messenger but they were sold out. The saleman told me their price is 1/2 off until December 31 and I could order one online. So got to get that done in the next couple days!!",,View Entry,"Dec 26, Tue",0
DX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582137,"Hiked six miles round trip with 25 pounds in the pack. Good hike with a friend along the Florida trail. Rained just a little but really not enough to get wet. Getting my pack and what I will be taking on the AT fine tuned. Looks like my base weight will be about 22 pounds and that includes some winter clothes. I’m happy with that. I can’t believe my hike starts in less than two months, will get here quickly!!",,View Entry,"Jan 10, Wed",0
DX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582614,"Hiked today with a group of hikers along the Florida Trail approximately 7 miles out and back. Beautiful morning for a hike with temps starting in the 40s but warming up nicely by 11am. I met a 2015 AT thru hiker during the hike, trailname “Red Pepper”and of course, proceed to tell him about my upcoming hike. Later after the hike was finished we met for a couple beers and more conversation about the AT. Discussed gear, hostels, shelters, other hikers he encountered, weather, injuries and other topics. He gave some great tips on taking care of blisters. Very enjoyable day.",,View Entry,"Jan 31, Wed",0
DX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582794,"March 5 is getting close! It will be here before I know it. Feeling excited, anxious to get going but at the same time, nervous. Guess all that is pretty normal based on what I've been reading and viewing on thru hiker related blogs and videos. I'll be fine and I do believe I'm ready.Loaded up the backpack with about 25 lbs and did a short 2 hour hike today at a local park. Pack felt good and no problems with it or the load. The pack had everything I am planning to take loaded with the exception of just a couple of small items and an article or two of clothing I'm debating on taking. Looks like full pack including food and water will be no more than 30 lbs when I head out on the AT. Today I also tested out my Spot gps device and made sure it was set up right. Pretty cool to go to the website and see that indeed it did send my location at the 5 min intervals as it was suppose to do. Also set up my tent in the park, just for the practice and to show it to my friend that was with me today. Had it up and down and packed away in about 15 minutes. I had to laugh to myself as I saw the park maintenance employee come close by and gave me eye as he saw the tent set up in the park's picnic area....",,View Entry,"Feb 09, Fri",0
DX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583106,Loaded up my full pack and headed out along the Florida Trail with a friend this morning. We did a section of the trail where there are diggings for the old Florida cross barge canal. The hills from the diggings are still there and we went up and down several times. Not like the AT pointless up and downs (PUDs) but it’s the best I can do in Florida!! Had fun and did a little over six miles. Less than two weeks and I’ll be on the AT!! I cannot wait!,,View Entry,"Feb 20, Tue",0
DX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583607,"Arrived Saturday afternoon and checked in at the visitor center and received my thru hiker number, #590!! Then proceeded go up to the lodge and attended some of ATKO events that is going on this weekend. Really had fun talking to others that are about to start their thru hike, as well as meeting some of the hostel owners, ridge runners, trail angels and of course Miss Janet who were all there. Very knowledgeable and friendly folks. Got some great advice and got even more excited about starting the hike. Did a little hiking as well since it was such a great weekend weather wise. Went up and down the 600+ stairs by the falls and went out and back on the approach trail a couple of miles. I guess I can now say I slackpacked the first 3 miles of the approach trail. 
Starting my hike Monday morning from the lodge, can’t believe time is now after all the years of thinking about it.",,View Entry,"Mar 04, Sun",0
DX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583746,Started at the lodge at 850 and started up the approach trail. 7.7 miles to Springer Mountain summit and actual beginning of the AT. So these first miles do not even count! Got to springer about 2. My friend steve who drove me up to send me off also hiked up to the summit with me then turned and headed back to his car. Thanks Steve for the ride and all your help. I went ahead another 2.8 miles to stover creek shelter and stopped for the night. Total 10.6 miles but only 2.8 miles count!! Great hike today. About 15 people around the shelter but only 5 of us in the shelter. Suppose to rain tonight so I opted to stay in the shelter,"Amicalola Falls Lodge

DX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583747,"Lucky I opted to stay in the shelter as it rained off and on all night and at 7 when everyone started stirring it was raining steady. At 8 rain stopped so after packing and eating some breakfast I headed out and of course started raining again. Rain continued till about 130 with temps around mid 50s. Leap frogged several groups of hikers thru the day, stopped about 430 and set up camp. About six others here and are all friendly.","Stover Creek Shelter

DX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583750,"Rolled out of the tent this morning, cold with a few snow flakes. Eat a little breakfast as I pack everything into the pack and headed down the trail. Snow just lasted a few minutes and the wind started. Quite windy along parts of the trail and with the low temps I hiked with my puffy jacket on. Kept warm enough. Some good views today but had to keep moving or i would lose body heat. Made it to Lance Creek campsite about 4. Ate a good meal and crawled into the tent. Good day hiking today. Suppose to get into the low 20s tonight. I’ll bundle up and should be fine.","Justus Creek

Keep me warm along with fleece gloves, buff around the neck, wool stocking hat and my OR hat. Snow flakes falling all day but no accumulation except in a few spots. Leapfrogged quite a few thru hikers during the day and saw two groups of day hikers. 
Going up and down Blood Mountain is no joke, but slow and steady did it for me. A few tough steep slick spots along the way. During the day, myself and another thru hiker decided to split the cost of a cabin at Blood Mountain cabins. Glad we did as another cold upper 20s night is forecasted. Now warm in a bed, showered and ate pizza for dinner. Nice feeling after a few days on the trail. O yeah, got laundry done as well.","Lance Creek

DX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583892,"Left Blood Mountain Cabins a little before 8. Temp around 30. Clear weather but at times windy through out the day. Actually a really good hiking day. Again saw several thru hikers, some I had met before and some new to me. Hiked most of the day with “mega cash pop tart” cool guy about 50 yo that has done a lot of hiking in the past few years. Came across my first “trail magic “ today. Trail magic is when someone is at a road crossing to give hikers drinks and/or food freely, they do it out of the kindness of their heart and most are/were hikers themselves and just want to give back. I meet “lionheart” at hogpen Gap, Ga state road 348. Out of his truck he was giving out water, soda, fruit, snacks to hiker that came along. I got some fruit drinks and couple of snacks. Thanks lionheart!! Very cool of you.
At low Gap shelter area tonight. I set up my tent in the tent section as there are about a dozen or so 20somethings around the shelter. Mega cash pop tart and a few other tenters here as well.
Gave out my first trail name that has stuck. The other night a guy was getting into his hammock and fell out. Other than embarrassed he was fine. I called him Gilligan from the tv show because of the hammock incident and plus he is skinny and young and it just fits him. Other hikers picked up the name and now he is stuck with it. 
Probably will get a ride into hiawassee tomorrow as it is suppose to rain starting tomorrow afternoon and all day Sunday.","Neel Gap

Stayed at hotel today, did laundry, tentative plan the next week hike, went to store resupplied food and generally just relaxed. Actually would have been an okay hiking day with just a little rain most of the day. But tonight it’s suppose to start again and last to mid morning tomorrow. O well looks like my first couple hours back on trail will be in the rain. They say “No rain, no pain, no Maine”. Hopefully it won’t be too bad, I am ready to get back out there.","Hiawassee

Cloudy cold and a little rain which turned to flakes at higher elevation. Finally about 130 the skies cleared but wind and cold stayed. Came across Trail magic again and same guy “Lionheart “ in addition to everything he had before he had hot chocklet, really good. I packed in 3 cheeseburgers from McD for lunch.
Decided to hike a little further to get in a shelter tonight because of the cold and wind. Glad I did. Suppose to be in the 20s tonight","Unicoi Gap

Glad I opted to stay inside as the wind did pick up at times during the night. Everyone got up around 7 and most were on the trail by 830 including myself. Sunny skies made the hiking good.

Started hiking with about 10 hikers including “Mosey” a hiker I’ve been hanging with the last couple days. We spread out fast with the younger folks leaving us older ones behind. Depending on which side of the mountain I was on it was windy and cold or calm and a lot warmer. Had to take off/put on my jacket a few times throughout the day. All in all a good day hiking. Tenting at the shelter area tonight. Shelter is full and about 10 tents around. Always cool to see other hikers I hadn’t seen for a few days during the day. Saw Duke and Prez.

A trail maintenance crew was using horses to haul up wood and equipment to build a new privy at standing Indian shelter. Beautiful animals and it was a pleasure to chat with the crew a few minutes. Thanks to volunteers like them we have a trail to hike. The downside of the mountain can be just as hard. Always watching where to step, and always mud, rocks, and roots to deal with.  Was warmer today and the wind not as bad, that was good. Chance of rain late tonight so I might have to deal with packing a wet tent in the morning, yuck.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

It was no fun packing up a wet tent but got everything packed and I was on the trail by 830. Rained a little during the morning and was a little cold but by mid morning rain had gone and sun came out. The climb up Albert Mountain was no joke, very steep for about half mile. Had to use my hands to climb up about four different times. Finally got up to the fire tower, windy on the summit. Of course I had to climb the tower for the views and snap a few pictures.

But shelter already fun when I got here, o well I’ll be dry in the tent. Also rained off and on during the day, not hard just enough to keep things wet. Leap frogged several thru hikers today, some new faces, some I know. Long up hill hike to the Wayah Bald tower. The whole area had a forest fire a couple years ago and there is still a lot of evidence of the fire. Wayah Bald tower is stone with a wooden roof. The roof was destroyed in the forest fire but has since been rebuilt. Foggy when I got there, no views but I still went up the tower just to say I did.","Rock Gap

The 5 miles downhill hike to the shelter was no joke. Some of it very steep, sure glad it wasn’t raining during this section. Made it to Rufus Morgan Shelter about 530 just as it started to rain. Putting up the tent in rain is no fun but managed to keep the inside dry, got inside and set up for the night. Tired and rain made my decision for me, no cooking dinner tonight.

I got about 4 miles up the trail the snow was half up to my knee on trail and could only walk in others footsteps as the trail was completely covered. I knew I had more elevation to climb and the snow would only get worse so I turned around and headed back to the NOC, too much snow for this Florida boy!! Born and lived in Florida my entire life and had only seen snow maybe ten times ever and never had hiked in it.
