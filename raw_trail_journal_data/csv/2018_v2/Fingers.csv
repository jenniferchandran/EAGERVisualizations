Fingers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577971,"I'm now in high drive for preparing for the shot at a thru-hike of the AT.  Here's what I've pretty much set my mind to thus far.  I could always be convinced to go another direction.  Now mind you, some of the gear listed I'm taking because I already own it and I'm comfortable with it.  No, it's not the best or the lightest but for me it's the most cost effective.  I know I'll make changes on the trail.
Pack - Kelty Coyote 80 (I've had this pack for numerous years, used it on more than a few back country hikes)
Tent - MSR Hubba NX one person (I have not purchased as of date) UPDATE(Now leaning towards Big Agnes Copper Spur UL2)
Sleeping bag - REI Magna 10 (not purchased yet)(UPDATE just purchased 09/29/2017) Did some minor testing and so far I'm thinking I did the right thing.
Sleeping pad - Thermorest  Neo lite (not purchased yet)
Cooking Setup - MSR Whisperlite stove / GSI pot (I've had this for several years with use so I'm keeping it) (UPDATE: I changed my mind. I now think I'm going buy the MSR Pocket Rocket 2)
Water Filter - Katadyn Hiker Pro (I've used and had this item for several years)
Rain Jacket - North Face Venture (just purchased this jacket at an outlet with 40% off)
Columbia Silver Ridge (convertible) hiking pants.  (Just tried them out on a 3.5 mile hike in 90 degree weather.  I liked them.  Very light weight.
North Face Retrac hiking pants - I gave this a whirl today (09/27/17) for about 4 miles of pretty tough hiking. rock scrambles, climbing over blow downs and through a few canyons.  I think these pants will serve the purpose.  They are heavier than the Columbia pants so intend to use these earlier in the hike when the weather is still cold.",,GA to ME,"Sep 18, Mon",0
Fingers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578616,"On the 25th I turned 53.  It just hit me that day.  I NEED to do this hike.  I need the challenge.  I need to get more prepared.  With each passing day, I get more excited and more looking forward to meeting the people of the trail.  I don't yet know what it is, but I honestly feel this hike may be extremely life changing for me.  
I'm always looking for ideas too.  If you have an idea for me on what I can do with my AT hike to really make it into something even bigger than the hike itself, I'm all ears.  I know there has been many books written on the AT.  I'm just wondering, is there a TV show that people would watch about either hiking in general or just about the AT?  My mind is spinning.  Is there a documentary that hasn't covered the AT hikes?  Share your thoughts!",,View Entry,"Sep 27, Wed",0
Fingers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578889,"I'm inching my way towards a more confident pack.  I'm (and this is weird for me) actually giddy because I bought my sleeping bag.  I was in Ann Arbor, MI doing some work and stopped in at the local REI store.  I knew what bag I thought I wanted  but I really made the sales assistant sell me on why one bag was better than the other.  After comparing, listening and trying them out on the floor of REI, I made my choice.  I went with what I thought was going to be the best bag for me.  I pulled the trigger on the REI Co-op Magma 10.  I hate being cold and I went with this bag thinking it gave me a little extra warmth protection.  I'll be field testing it this week in 40 degree weather.
I'm now reconsidering my cooking system as well.  It's between the Snow Peak Litemax and the MSR Pocket Rocket 2.  Still doing research...",,View Entry,"Oct 02, Mon",0
