Beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582733,"If you’re reading this, you’re already aware that I intend to hike the entire Appalachian Trail trail this year. My launch date will be March 6th, 2018, as my parents have so generously offered to drop me off in Amicalola Falls State Park, GA. From there, I will walk 2,190.9 miles through the Appalachian Mountains to Mt Katahdin, in Baxter State Park, ME.
Depending on cell phone service, I’ll try to post an update every 1-2 weeks. My parents will have more frequent updates, so if you have any intuition I may have been mauled by a bear, they should be able to stifle your concerns.
I encourage anyone to ask any questions, and I’ll be sure to address them in future posts. Can’t wait to get started!

Beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582734,"As news of my planned journey became public knowledge, I have received a lot of similar questions; so here are a few of them.
Q: “Are you crazy?”
A: Depends on your definition. The general consensus seems to be yes.
Q: “Are you going by yourself?!”
A: Yes. About 2,000 people start the trail every year from the southern end, most between March 1st and April 15th, and most are solo hikers. So I will only be alone in the woods if I choose to be (which I very well may). A few friends will hike various sections with me. If you would like to meet me somewhere and do a day, weekend or week, follow along and we will coordinate something!
Q: “Haven’t you seen Deliverence??”
A: No. But recently I’ve been told many times I have some “perty lips”. Thanks! Do you watch Final Destination every time before you get on a plane? However, I do watch Wedding Crashers before I go to every wedding.
Edit: My lovely coworkers did buy me a copy of this movie, as it was deemed “educational information”. Terrible movie all around haha.
Q: “Where will you sleep?”.
A: Well, since you are my only audience, and you haven’t given me millions of dollars, a Discover Channel show, and helicopter to fly to a holiday inn express every night, I suppose I’ll sleep in my tent or one of the many shelters along the way. (Didn’t mean to dig on you Bear Grylls). But seriously, he’s a badass and you should read some of his books.
Q: “You’re bringing a gun, right?”
A: No. I will smell bad enough that no one will want to get within a half mile of me.
Q: “But what about bears?!”
A: My tent is made of 20D ripstop nylon. I’m pretty sure that means it can D-efend against 20 bears at once. Or maybe not..but let’s be honest, if I was going to get mauled by a bear, it would have happened a long time ago.
Q: “How do you get food?”
A: I plan stalk and hunt down 1 deer every few weeks with my bare hands, then strap the body to my pack until I run out of meat. Option 2: The trail gets close to, or goes through towns every few days, so I can stock up on high calorie, light weight items like pasta, tuna packets, jerky, nuts, etc. If you are really feeling generous, you will be able to send me mail drops to different post offices along my way (master list of post offices can be found here: https://www.whiteblaze.net/forum/content.php/220-Post-Offices-along-the-Appalachian-Trail). Follow along with me on here or Facebook messenger to find out where I’ll be, and when.

Beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582735,"Okay, so now that you know the basics, let’s get into more detail.
Q: “How many miles will do average per day?”
A: I’m planning on taking just under 6 months to hike the trail, which means I’ll have to average about 13 miles per day. I’m going to start slow for my first few weeks to get my body acclimated, so I’m trying to stay around 10 miles or less. It will vary, depending on the terrain. Some days will be flat, and I’ll be able to rock 25 miles, some days will be straight up, then straight down mountains. Even when I am conditioned, these will probably be back to 10 mile days.
Q: “How much will your pack weigh?”
A: Right now, I’m looking at 35 pounds, which includes 4 days of food, and 2 liters of water. This weight will go down as the weather warms up, and I ditch gear that I don’t actually need. The more weight you carry, the more comfort and conveniences you’ll have at camp; but you’ll be miserable while hiking. It’s a balancing act.
Q: “How will you shower?”
A: When the weather is warmer, I’ll be taking a lot of swims in the rivers and streams. But I will also be going through campgrounds, and staying at various hostels along the way where I can fully shower, and with any luck, do some laundry and charge my phone and battery pack (more on this below).
I have received a lot questions about specific gear, so here’s the basics:
65 liter, Osprey pack. 18 degree, down sleeping bag. 1.5 inch thick, self inflating sleeping pad. 2 person, NEMO tent. Anker 10k battery pack (No, solar chargers do not work on the AT; too much tree coverage). 
Snow Peak Gita Power 2.0 camp stove for cooking (This thing is awesome! highly recommend. It fold up to about the size of a pill bottle, and screws onto a separate fuel canister).
Solomon, over the ankle boots. I anticipate going through a few pairs of boots, as they will wear out (even though Solomon’s are awesome). I might switch to lighter weight trail runners as the weather gets warmer.
I think that covers the major items. As always, if you have more questions, or want to know specifically what gear I’m using and how I like it, just let me know!

I slept at shelters the first 2 nights, though I chose to sleep in my tent outside the shelter instead. Met some pretty awesome folks, but split up with them today as some were planning bigger days, and others were headed into town for a shower. SO, that means I’m “stealth camping” for the first time tonight, which means I’m not at a designated site or shelter. It’s going to be a cold night; 19 degrees and 20-35 mph winds.

Had an easy 3.5 mile day through the snow and wind to get here, which was a welcome short day after 14.5, then 15.5 mile days back to back. I received the trail name “BEAST” after the 14.5 mile day in under 5 hours (which includes stops for water and food). The name also came about after scrubbing out my blister with an alcohol swab with a smile on my face. In total, I’ve done 69 miles, plus the 8.8 mile approach trail in 6 days, and I’ll be crossing into NC tomorrow! Everything is feeling great besides the blister, and all other systems are a go.

Beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584440,"Hey everyone! Lots of things to update you on over the past week. First and foremost, Mother Nature has been a little moody. In the past 5 days, I’ve slept in/hiked through -10 degree wind chills on Standing Indian Mountain, survived a thunderstorm, rain, hail, high winds and a tornado warning on an exposed ridge in the middle of the night, and descended through burnt out forests in 80 degree heat to the Natahala Outdoors Center. I hear we have a Nor’easter coming through as I hit the Smokies tomorrow.
On a lighter note, I got to meet the one and only “Pappy”. He is an 87 year old man hiking the entire trail this year! So no more excuses from you all saying you’re too old to do this now. Oh, and I forgot to mention, he already hiked the Appalachian Trail, Pacific Crest Trail, and the Continental Divide trail in the mid 90s-early 2000s. Hiking these 3 trails earns you the title of “triple crowner”, and I believe he is the oldest living triple crowner; and he’s coming back for more! He is such an awesome guy; young at heart, always cracking jokes and putting us younger guys to shame.
I’m well into North Carolina now, and I’ll be crossing into Tennessee and the Smokey Mountains tomorrow or the next day. I have been doing 14-16 miles days now with relative ease, and the monster blister has turned into a solid callus now. Feeling great and having the time of my life!

Beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584507,"As I leave the state of North Carolina, I want to take the time to thank all of the trail angels that I encountered. Trail angels provide “trail magic” to us dirty, desperate hikers. Trail magic can be anything from a lift into town for a burger or grocery store, to leaving a dozen apples, grilling hotdogs, snacks, drinks, and sometimes even beers for hikers passing through. I even had the First Baptist Church in Franklin, NC run shuttles and pick up about 30 hikers to bring them I church for all you can eat pancakes and bacon! Many of these angels are former hikers repaying the magic they received, others do it for no particular reason.  Quest (pictured above) is one of these angels that I ran into yesterday, and turns out he has been following my blog! He completed his thru hike in 2004 at the ripe young age of 60, and moved to an area along the trail that he fell in love with. He says he tries to get out every day this time of year to provide a little magic. Thanks again Quest! As well as all the other angels that I have met along the way so far.
If you are a current, or future hiker, take the time to sit down and talk with these great people. They all have great stories and advice that can enrich your hike, and maybe even your outlook on life. Many people are great at talking, but don’t take the time to just listen.","

Beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584791,"A lot of people have been asking what I eat on the trail. Now that I’m in a cozy hotel room with WiFi for the weekend eating a large Pizza Hut pan pizza and breadsticks, I’ll give you the skinny on how skinny people eat.
So yesterday I cranked out an 18 mile day though the smokies in a foot of snow, and here is what I ate: 
8am, first breakfast: Folgers instant coffee, 2 packages of apple cinnamon oatmeal with a handful of craisins and 3 scoops of protein powder. 9am, Second breakfast: dried mango slices and 3 fun sized milkeyway bars. 1030am, 3rd breakfast: nature valley bar and a smaller dose of mango slices. 
12pm, 1st lunch: Knorr pasta sides with bacon/ranch flavored tuna packet and 1 scoop of protein powder. 3pm, 2nd lunch: Met Rx birthday cake flavor protein bar (freakin delicious) and a handful of craisins. 
530pm, 1st dinner while 2nd dinner is cooking: 1/2 block of exxxtra sharpe cheddar cheese and 1/4 summer sausage. 6pm, 2nd dinner: 1/2 cup of quinoa with 1/2 packet of chicken, added olive oil and Tony C’s creole, with a side of loaded cheddar bacon instant mashed potatoes.

Beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585038,"The past 5 days of hiking have certainly been the most challenging yet. I dare say most parts were hard to enjoy, given the winter storm. Summiting from the southern terminus of the park in the heat of the nor’easter, then 3 more days trudging though deep snow; some drifts waist deep. Every step takes twice the effort as your planted foot slides half way back down the mountain. But freezing temperatures and high winds make it impossible to stop and rest, for fear of hypothermia. A days rest in Gatlinburg was much needed. 
While in town, another major rain storm moved through, which turned all of the snow into ankle deep slush. Where there wasn’t slush, the over flowing springs turned the trail to a river in most spots. After a day and a half of that mess, the sun came out today as we descended almost 5,000 feet to the northern terminus of the park. Things finally started to warm up this afternoon and life is good again. We saw a few great views, but most were shielded by the snow storm or the fog. I’m happy I’ll be living below 6,000 feet for a while now. 
As I left the smokies and trekked on a few more miles to my current camp site, I realize that by doing so, I’ve done something that roughly 3,500 hikers will not do this year; make it past the Smokey Mountains. About 50% of the hikers attempting to hike the entire trail will not make it to this point. Of the hikers that remain, about another 50% will not make it to Harpers Ferry, WV, the unofficial half way point. I feel like I’ve survived some of the worst conditions I will encounter on this trip, and am feeling confident.","Mile 141.2

Beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585660,"Made it to the 300 mile mark! Get it now? Actually, I’ll be nearing the 400 mile mark by Friday. However, I won’t cross that line until after a stellar weekend in Asheville with Wertz and Colleen, who are coming from Greensboro, and Jason and Korey flying down from Pittsburgh! 
The trail has been much more kind as of late in regards to elevation changes, terrain and weather; especially north of Hot Springs. Speaking of north, this brings me to the only bone I’ve had to pick recently. I hiked a 16 mile section of trail yesterday, heading “northbound” on the trail, but I was actually traveling SOUTH. Way to go trail-makers. So even though I’ve hiked 63 miles the past 3 days, some of that mileage actually got me further from Maine.
When I was looking at places to be picked up for this weekend, I had not predicted I would be this far along yet. Those pick up spots have gotten further and further away almost every day. Then on Saturday night I picked 3 more spots. One would allow me to average 9 miles per day for 6 days. The next was 13 miles, and the final spot would take an average of 18.1 miles for 6 straight days. After 22 mile, 20 mile, and 21 mile days back-to-back-to-back, I’m sittin’ pretty.
Animal spottings have been on the increase with it getting into the 60s most days now. I saw my first bear early this morning! Heard it turn around and run the other direction long before I saw is rear end go down over the hill. I’ve seen 1 deer, 2 snakes (none venomous), I’ve heard owls close by the last 2 nights and I can heard coyotes a long ways away as I write this tonight.
Also want to make a shoutout to some more awesome trail angels I met the past 2 days. Both thru hiked the entire trail in 2007, but they didn’t know each other. “Silent Paul”, awesome hash browns and cookies! And “Yonder”, those hot dogs and doughnuts hit the spot!
One final thing; some of you had expressed an interest in sending me care packages. Now that I have gotten a feel for how many miles per week I can do, I can start planning my trips into town further in advance. The next major town I’ll be in will be Damascus, VA, probably near the weekend of April 12th. Text me or Facebook message me if you want to scrap together a package and I can tell you where to send it, or if you want to inquire about a later date. Excellent care package items include high calorie foods, bars, jerky, that kind of stuff. Ramen and oatmeal are pretty much on the menu in some form every day, but those are pretty easy to get anywhere around the trail. Also, things that are harder to get out here on the trail like fresh cookies, tiny liquor bottles or a cigar or two. Surprise me! If you send too much, there are plenty of other hikers who stiff around other peoples boxes when they open them (guilty).","Mile 243.3

Beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586453,"WOW! What am I more pumped about?! My first marathon on Tuesday? Or the Penguins 7-0 victory over the Flyers in game 1 on Wednesday?? Hard to choose; but both euphoric! So let’s take it back a few days... On Sunday afternoon, the Wertz’s dropped me off at Iron Mountain, where I ended my hike on Friday. 
After an awesome weekend in Asheville, NC; sleeping in a warm bed, freshly washed clothes, all the showers I desired and a bunch of “real food”, it was time to dip back into my “reality”. They were kind enough to drive me right back into the base of the snow line at 3,500 feet (thanks so much). After climbing to 6,100 feet and 3 more days of freezing rain, snow, frost, freezing temps, and 40 mph winds of “freezing fog”, I made it through another winter blast. 
Tuesday started off as any other day on the trail this year; pull my water filter, water bottles, fuel canister, electronics, and hiking clothes out of my sleeping bag (in order to keep them warm so they can function) and head off into the frozen abyss. The first few miles were straight uphill, on a bald, with no trees for cover the freezing wind (wind chill close to 0). After I started down the other side, it started to warm up, and I was feeling good and refreshed. I looked at my map, and thought... Is today the day? Bam! Decided doing my first marathon day was feasible. I did 26.2 miles in 9 hours, 58 minutes, and 4 seconds. That time may not seem like an impressive time, but I was also toting a 38# pack, 2.5# boots, climbed 5,426.2 feet of elevation, clambered over very uneven terrain, and stopped several times for great pictures and water/food/bathroom breaks. I even walked another 0.2 miles in search of my commemorative “26.2” bumper sticker, but it was nowhere to be found. 
The next day, as you would expect, was a bit slower, but warmer yet and was beautiful through Laurel Fork. 16 miles found me to the best hostel I’ve been to yet, “boots off hostel” in Hampton, TN. I VERY much enjoyed watching the Penguins pile up a 7-0 victory over the Flyers in game 1 while chilling by the fire; though I didn’t actually get to watch anything but the live updates and game recap. Great week overall, and I’ll be moving into Virginia by the weekend!","Iron Mountain Gap

Beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587134,"That was a pretty sad attempt at making a heart with my hands, but you get the picture. Well I made it to my 4th state! Virginia is the longest I will be in one state, as I will be on trail for 541 miles until crossing into West Virginia near the overall halfway point. Virginia started off great with a quick jaunt into Damascus for a resupply and to check out the local outfitters. A complete stranger who never even spoke to me picked up my all-you-can-eat pizza tab for lunch, and Adrienne and BJ drove out from Kingsport to treat me to a great dinner. Thanks guys!! I didn’t stay in town, and declined Adrienne’s offer for a warm bed and shower that night. I walked another mile down the trail to camp, knowing I was only 2 days away from getting to the much anticipated Grayson Highlands.
Picture this: It’s a warm sunny day, but a bit breezy, as you would expect while walking through open meadows and rolling hills.  It is the middle of April in the south, after all. You can see for miles in all directions. You see more open balds and mountains, and large rock structures jutting straight up out of the fields. There are wild ponies grazing in the endless green grass.  They walk towards you as they hear the familiar sound of the rustling of your potato chip bag. They eat from you hand and you give them a quick pet and take the obligatory selfie. You name one Steve, and the other Daffodil; but you don’t really know their names. They look happy together.  Birds chirping, and a hawk circles above, cruising effortlessly as it searches for lunch. This continues on for several miles, and all is right with the world. This is the Grayson Highlands; or at least how it went in everything I read, the pictures I saw, and the YouTube videos I watched.
Now, picture this: It just dumped 2 inches of rain the day before, but you didn’t mind because it’s 70 degrees and you just got a free shower and laundry. Then, overnight, the temperature drops 40 degrees, rain turns to snow. Everything that was wet is now frozen. You can’t hike in the dry clothes you’re wearing, because keeping these clothes dry in the only thing that will keep you warm when you get into your tent later that night. It’s 9am, 30 degrees and windy. You strip all of your dry clothes off and put your frozen clothes on, including your frozen socks and boots. You quickly realize “waterproof” is a very loose term in the outdoor clothing industry. As you start hiking, everything eventually melts and is just wet and cold. You ascend to the highest point in VA, Mt Rogers. The temperature drops into the 20s, and the winds only get stronger as the day goes on. Then you enter the wide open Grayson Highlands. You can see about 50 feet in front of you due to the storm and the ice pellets hitting your face at 40mph. The clothes on your body flash freeze again. The grass, trees and shrubs are all coated in ice. All of the pooled water from the rains the day before turn the trail into an ice rink. You walk 20 degrees off-center, leaning into the wind so you don’t get blown off of the trail. Suddenly, the wind changes direction and you fall off the other side of the trail instead. You look through squinted eyes to find any solid ground to put your next foot. You see a nice place for your right foot to land; you go for it. Next thing you know, you’re laces deep in horse poop, which also flash freezes to your boot. You get to the majestic rocks jutting up from the hills, and then have to traverse up, then down them. Oh, they’re coated in ice too. You follow 2x6 inch white markers that are painted periodically on the trees and rocks. Good thing those are all covered in white snow, and there are dozens of intersecting horse trails and side trails. As you walk across the 500 mile mark, even the voice in your head singing The Proclaimers, “I’m gonna Be” is shivering. There are no ponies to be found because what living creature would be walking through this? You finally get to camp, halfway through the highlands. You set up your tent, which is now frozen solid, and the winds try to blow it off into the woods. You don’t sleep because it’s too cold and the winds sound like a freight train trying to rip your frozen tent to shreds. You wake up the next day to find the same: The sun is out, but everything you own is still frozen. Same routine. Dry clothes off, frozen clothes on, and walk for 3 more hours through bitter cold and wind. You see 3 wild ponies in the distance, but it’s too cold to do anything but snap a picture and keep moving. That was my experience in the Grayson Highlands..and in the Smokies..and in the Roan Mtn area..and at least once a week for the past 6 weeks.
Part of me wants to get to the top of the next mountain and scream “YOU CALL THIS A STORM? IT’S TIME FOR A SHOWDOWN, YOU AND ME. I’M RIGHT HERE, COME AND GET ME!!”, like Lieutenant Dan in the crow’s nest on Forrest Gump’s shrimp boat. The other part of me wants to book the next flight to Jamaica.

It was so appreciated, especially given the rain. A real bed and some home cookin’ goes a long way! They also teamed up with Adrienne and BJ to put together a killer package. Thank you all so much!
Everyone has their own reasons for being out here hiking. I have noticed a lot of people set out to do this thru hike in order to “find themselves”. That fairy tail, Cheryl Strayed crap isn’t my game (although I did think “Wild” was a decent movie). I am out here for the adventure, for the challenge, and to experience a large chunk of the country in a way most people will never know. But after 7 weeks and 633 miles with nothing to do but eat, sleep, and walk, you tend to get a little introspective.  I’m learning how much of this trek is a mental game, even more than a physical challenge. Now that there are far fewer hikers left on the trail, there are less distractions and you really need to bring your mental A-game. (If you’re planning a long distance hike, I strongly recommend reading “Appalachian Trials” by Zach Davis for all your mental A-game tactics). I am learning that I am a lot tougher than I thought I was.
One big mistake I realized I had been making recently was beating myself up for not doing the mileage I planned out the night before, or taking too long to do those miles. Now that my body is able to handle 20+ mile days, I was getting down on myself if I did less than 20 miles in a day. For what? I’m in no hurry. The last person to Katahdin wins!
I realized there are basically 2 types of hikers out here: Those who put their head now, grit their teeth, walk from dawn to dusk and do 20-30 miles every day; and there are those who enjoy their thru hike. That first group, I can almost guarantee you, aren’t having a good time and can’t wait for this to end. I almost fell into that trap. However, over the past week especially, I have lowered my miles, walked a lot slower (for me), went down all the side trails to waterfalls and views, and didn’t really plan out my day. I wake up when I feel like it, walk until I get hungry or tired, then stop for a while. I walk again when I’m good and ready, and I set up my tent when I’ve had enough. 
This is how I told myself I would hike, but somewhere along the line I lost it for a bit. I will say, even through the rain the past 3 days, I have really been enjoying this experience a lot more. (I promise I’ll still make it to Maine in a reasonable time frame).","Stealth camp, mile 519.5
",Mile 633,"Apr 25, Wed",113.50
Beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588600,"Though many may criticize the donning of the Eagle Scout knot on the left shoulder strap of my backpack, I’m here to tell you why I feel it belongs.
The Eagle Scout rank is earned by only 4% of potential candidates..
“The rank has represented a milestone of accomplishment—perhaps without equal—that is recognized across the country and even the world. Men who have earned the Eagle Scout rank count it among their most treasured possessions. Eagle Scout is not just an award; it is a state of being. Those who earned it as boys continue to earn it every day as men. That is why an Eagle Scout IS an Eagle Scout—not WAS.”
I am proud to say I am one of those men.
However, the actual badge is only to be worn by current Scouts on their left breast pocket. As an adult leader, the Eagle Scout knot is worn in place of the badge, above the left breast pocket on the Boy Scout uniform. This knot is the patch you see on my pack. Though my uniform has not been worn in many years, I sewed my Eagle Scout knot onto the left shoulder strap of my pack as I thru-hike the Appalachian Trail.
Although it is likely seen by some as a disgrace to don this badge of great honor on anything other than a scout uniform, I am here to protest that.
This small mark on my shoulder strap is a constant reminder of the oath I took many years ago, and continue to live my life by; ”On my honor, I will do my best, to do my duty to God and my country, and to obey the scout law. To help other people at all times. To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.” When I encounter difficult times during my hike, I do not turn to my ear buds and listen to this month’s top 100 like most; no. This is the riddle I repeat in my head when I’m about to break. And let’s not forget the moto: “Be prepared”.
The reason why I am hiking is because of the amazing opportunities I had through scouts, including all of the camping, hiking, cooking, first aide, and wilderness survival training I received. A love for the woods, nature, and self sufficiency was all born through Troop 1452.
If that wasn’t reason enough to have that constant reminder on my left shoulder strap, I ask you to look to the Scout Law, which states: “A Scout is Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Kind, Obedient, Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, Clean, and Reverent.” These 12 commandments are powerful enough to get me through the most difficult times. More importantly, demonstrating some of these simple acts can be enough to get a fellow thru-hiker through difficult times, whether they realize it or not.
Many thru-hikers, day hikers, section hikers, and trail angels have recognized this badge and congratulated me on my achievement. Those who recognize such a small badge clearly have earned it themselves, or have close relation to its significance. I wear this badge not for recognition; but for those who do not recognize it, and could possibly benefit from all it has taught me.","

Over the past week especially, I have seen many more deer, turkey, turkey vultures, lizards, squirrels, etc. No more bears or snakes. Still no eagles or hawks, but I finally did spot a barred owl. Had been hearing a lot of them though. I killed my first tick, everything is green below 3,600 feet, and saw the first rhododendron blooms yesterday. 
I have officially fallen flat on my face as of 2 weeks ago. A few times, I have stumbled and would have been considered “down by contact” in the NFL; but this latest was a doozy. It seems the largest threat to me staying on my feet are actually sticks on the ground that like to get tangled between my legs like jamming a stick into the spikes of bicycle.
Recent problems with rubbing/ blisters and soreness in the bottom of my feet has forced me to buy new shoes. Working out well so far!
Fears of frost bite, wind burn, and hypothermia have now transitioned to bug bites, sunburn, and dehydration. But hey, anyone can hike on a good day, and no one said thru-hiking was supposed to be easy.","Mile 633

Beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590550,"Leading up to my thru-hike, I have heard many times things like: “Once you get to Virginia, it’s flat.” “You just stay up on the ridge line the whole way through Virginia.” As I sit here writing this, I can, without question, tell you that those statements are FALSE. My days through Virginia to this point have boasted more elevation change that any other portion south, with only a few exceptions. Does the Virginia portion of the trail run across ridge lines? Yeah, actually it does. However, there are no water sources on the ridge line, and the trail cannot be designed to run many miles without a reliable water source. So this is how Virginia works. You get water at a nice stream, climb 1,400 vertical feet to a ridge line, and hike the ridge for about 5 miles. Then, 1,400 feet down to a stream to get water. What’s next? Oh, 2,300 feet up the the next ridge to the east; hike it for 5 miles, then back down 2,300 feet. This process repeats itself 2, sometimes 3 times per day depending on how many miles you do per day. As “Dixie” said in one her videos (AT 2015, PCT 2017, current CDT thru-hiker) “I hope Pennsylvania is as rocky and Virginia is flat”. This was obviously stated with heavy sarcasm.
Though I will say, the last 1/4 of Virginia through Shenandoah National Park is much more “flat”. This is my new version of “flat” though, after I descended 2,900 feet from The Priest, and ascended 3,400 feet up the Three Ridges last week.
Luckily, Jason and Braden were spared of those monster climbs, as they met up with me the next day. Cheers to them though, because it certainly wasn’t easy hiking for those 3.5 days. With high humidity, temps in the upper 80’s, and 12 mile stretches of trail with no water, it was challenging, even for me with 900 miles experience on them.  All said and done, they did 49.3 miles of hiking, which is bigger than any prep hikes I did before starting my thru hike. We also encountered more snakes, and had a way too close for comfort encounter with bears outside our tents at 2am one night. You guys rocked it!","Stanimal’s hostel. Mile 786

Beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591562,"I’m beginning to become accustomed to the widely varying challenges of the trail. As I stated before, I knew it wasn’t going to be easy, but every week we seems to get something new thrown our way. The past week has hosted relentless rain fall, and actually hiking in the rain isn’t too bad minus the big thunder storms. The northern part of Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland has been quite easy (on paper at least). Gentle grades, wide, and mostly smooth trail. However, the rain has turned the trail into a river in most spots. When it’s not a rushing river, the mud is ankle deep, and the rocks are slick. Freshly downed trees are also hard to navigate. Everything is waterlogged, feet are soggy and that has caused some new, impressive blisters. My next challenge is at least predictable: the hellish rocks of Pennsylvania. But there has been many recent victories. 
I finished the 550 mile stretch of Virginia without getting the “Virginia Blues”, I reached to 1,000 mile landmark, and made it to the “Psychological halfway point” at the ATC Headquarters. Actual halfway point won’t come for another few days. I got my new hiker number; I started in Georgia as #700, and now I am #258 to check in at the ATC Headquarters! Sarah drove down to meet me in Harpers Ferry for a night which was awesome! Ended up staying a second night in town with Sunshine and her mom because the bridge over the Potomac River leaving Harpers Ferry was closed due to flooding. 
I have gotten a few care packages from some wonderful people, and we are continuing north to Pennsylvania! Life is good (and soggy)!

Beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593835,"I can’t believe I haven’t given a thorough update since I crossed into PA some 250 miles ago. I knew I was officially home when a women in the pizza joint in Boiling Springs came up to us and asked “Yinz gon dahn the Appalachian Trail?” I quickly responded yes, then had to translate the Pittsburgheese for Skywalker and Rhodo, who are from NC. I think Sunshine and Evan (now known as GreenBag) understood, as they are from West Virginia and Central PA respectively.
The biggest known threat in PA are all of the rocks and rattlesnakes. Even though I have seen way more snakes than I am comfortable with, none of them were venomous. Many fellow hikers were having troubles with the rocks, but I honestly didn’t think they were that bad. Many complained that this was the worst part of the entire trail so far, but those people obviously didn’t go through the Smokey’s during a Nor’Easter. Only then do you have full appreciation for what pure misery really is. Switching back to my big boots from trail runners probably accounted for my success through the rocks compared to others.
The best parts about PA (since there really weren’t many great views) included opportunities to meet up and hike with friends and family, as well as the occasional short detour to Sheetz. Evan came out and hiked 46.1 miles with me over Memorial Day weekend from Pine Grove Furnace to Duncannon. In the middle of that trip, my buddy from college, JP came out to chill at camp outside of Boiling Springs. After Memorial Day, my parents came out to spend a few much needed days off the trail in Gettysburg. JB took me and Sunshine in for a night of relaxation and excellent food outside of Port Clinton, Bill took us out in Bethlehem, and Melissa took us out in Palmerton. To wrap things up, Jake (now known as Urkle) came out to start of New Jersey with me, and I took him through 27.4 miles of brutal rocks. The NJ rocks proved to be even more challenging than the famed PA rocks.
It’s been a very busy few weeks for me sharing this journey with all of those great people, and I want to thank you all again for everything you have done for me along the way! I’m afraid everyone on the trail is starting to get the illusion I’m actually popular. Now I’m anticipating doing some hiking with Sarah this weekend, and then I have to work on coordinating getting Charlie and Greg out here!

Beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594273,"It’s no secret to most of my close friends that I generally don’t like most people, and have lost all faith in humanity (okay that’s a little extreme but not completely false). This is one of the reasons why I decided to go live in the woods and hike for 6 months. However, this trail, and the community surrounding it had drastically changed my opinion on this topic...until I hit New Jersey. Sarah, I know you really enjoy seeing people’s blogs and vlogs giving props to New Jersey. With that in mind, I would like to inform you this is not one of those blogs, enter at your own risk.
Now, for those of you who like a good Jersey bashing, buckle up, you’re in for a treat.
I went into NJ having heard good things from other previous thru-hikers; I suppose individual results may vary. Let’s first talk about the terrain...Snake infested rocks, mosquito infested swamps, bears everywhere, and very lackluster views. Not a whole lot different than Pennsylvania, so I can deal with that. But here is where it starts to grind on me. I was in NJ for about 5 days, and “rattlesnake spring” was the only single water source I can recall where I thought to myself “I don’t think this water will give me cancer”. All of the other water sources were murky, black, orange, smelled like sulfur, you name it. Also not a fan of all of the rules in place here. No fires, no camping outside of designated areas and shelters, no swimming, no fun. If I wanted rules I wouldn’t be in the woods. Now comes the real kicker. The people of New Jersey; you the real MVPs. Again, as many of you know, I’m not the most social person, especially when is comes to strangers. But everyone who I have run into so far in the outdoors is generally cheerful and social; except in NJ. Every other area I have been through, you say “Hi”, and “How are you?” to hikers passing you in the opposite direction. Strange right? Try this in NJ, it’s almost comical watching the people completely ignore you, without even nodding, smiling, or acknowledging you exist. I’ve never seen anything like it. I tried to think back to a good human interaction in NJ, and thought I had one. “Those people at the deli and pizza shop were super nice!”, I thought. Then I realized we actually crossed the boarder into NY to get into that town.
I assumed the people would be one in the same in the New York section, given how close we are to NYC. But let me tell you, it has been night and day since I crossed the boarder. Everyone I see on the trail now at least says hi, if not have a few minute long conversation with you. There has been trail magic at nearly every road crossing, the water is again clean, and there are views that reward your hard work through the vicious, but fun rock scrambles.

Beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595597,"Well, I did it! Something that I have been anticipating since leaving Virginia; I made it to Vermont! Although I really only roasted New Jersey, the trail through WV, MD, PA, NJ, NY, and CT has been kind of a drag. I thought it would be nice hiking easy miles through these states, as you only exceed 2,000 feet elevation on a few rare occasions. However, these easy miles also means there is nothing great to look at. I have quickly realized that “The best view comes after the hardest climb”. Massachusetts has been much more scenic than the aforementioned states, but it still kinda brings you down with all of the rules in place in regards to camping in designated areas, no fires, etc. The terrain has finally changed back to steep climbs on the edge of cliffs that fall off into the abyss. My kinda terrain!Now that I am in Vermont, I feel free again, and excited to hike every day. I thought I was the only person feeing this way, but after talking with many other thru-hikers, almost everyone has been feeling this way.The Vermont boarder has been motivating me over the past few days, and I hiked a personal best 135 miles in 5 days through the end of NY, all of CT, and the majority of MA. That’s a 27 mile per day average! Perfect training for the Wine Glass Marathon I just signed myself up for after I finish the trail. Now that I have reached Vermont and have less than 600 miles until the end of the trail, I have made a conscious decision to slow down my hike and get back to enjoying every moment. At my current pace, I would finish the trail at the beginning of August. Let’s be real, why would I want to be done so soon? My target end date is August 22, which means I only have to average about 10 miles per day. I am going turn 20+ mile days into 15 mile days, and take a lot of zero days going forward.

Beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596548,"Well Vermont, it’s been real. The southern portion of Vermont was very busy, as the Appalachian trail and the Vermont Long Trail share the same route until Killington. At that point, the VLT continues north through the Green Mountains, and the AT heads east towards New Hampshire and the White Mountains. Vermont has been gorgeous; finally getting into real mountains with real views again. However, I seem to have missed the memo on the “Ver-mud”. I’m not sure what creates this phenomenon, probably underground springs. But even in the driest conditions, the southern half of Vermont is very muddy. Along with a few rain storms, the mud becomes ankle, and even shin deep. Pair this with a full week of 90+ degree weather, humidity, and stagnant air, the mosquitos and black flies have been a real treat. Thankfully, things have started to cool back off.
I’ll be heading into New Hampshire very soon, and shortly after, the most difficult portion of the trail, the White Mountains. They say once you complete 80% of the trail, you’ve only done about 20% of the work. I’m not at all nervous to get into this difficult terrain, because I’ve already decided to significantly slow my pace. The only sad part about this decision is since I’ve been slowing down the past week or so, many people who I have hiked portions of the trail with early on are now catching up to, and passing me. I realize that this will probably be the last time I see them, and I have no intention of speeding back up.

As you’ll notice from the excessive amount of new pictures I have been posting, the trail has quickly gone from tedious and boring to “holy cow, and I still on the east coast?!”. My first distant view of the White Mountains came from atop the Smarts Mountain Fire tower, just across the boarder in NH. From there, the mountains look big compared to the surrounding mountains. But as I crossed mount Cube and got into Glencliff, NH, the sheer size and steepness started to become reality. Mt Moosilauke, though not technically part of the White Mountains, is the first 4,000 foot peak the trail goes over since The Priest, south of Shenandoah National Park. (Killington is just over 4k, but you have to take a side trail to the summit).
Mt Moosilauke is a “warm welcome” to the Whites. The climb is long, but not terribly steep. Next is Mt Kinsman, the first official peak in the White Mountains. The elevation profile doesn’t look much different than Moosilauke, but this is a whole different animal. 2.5 miles of near vertical rock climbing to the summit took almost 2 hours with no breaks. From the summit, I got the first view of the beautiful Franconia Ridge. This looks very intimidating, but I can’t wait!
For now, I am posted up at a hostel in town, waiting for thunderstorms to pass. These mountains can be very deadly to those who do not pay close attention to the weather forecast.New Hampshire has been full of awesome people, and tons of trail magic including “The Omlet Man”, and previous thru-hikers who fill their packs full of beer and sit on top of 4,000+ foot mountains and hand them out to current thru hikers all day long.

If you count Mt Moosilauke as part of The Whites (some do, some don’t), this stretch is just over 100 miles, and over 32,000 feet of elevation gain (All of last month was only 44,000 feet elevation gain).  I did this stretch over the course of 7 days on trail, and this is definitely the most physically exhausted I have been throughout the entire trail. I had planned to take an extra 2 days to do this stretch, but these mountains, specifically Mt Washington get the worst weather in the world. 
Franconia Ridge starts the section where you spend the majority of the day above tree line, and while on top of Mt Lafayette, I noticed the impending storms that began on Sunday, and is predicted to continue for 7 days.  I made the decision to try to push through these treacherous mountains before these storms start. The catch is that I did not want to rush through this section because the views are absolutely amazing; some of the most breathtaking views I have ever seen. I did take my time, but in order to get the necessary miles in, this meant starting to hike by 6am, and several times hiking well into the night to get back below tree line. The peak of the physical exhaustion occurred while hiking for 15 hours through the entire Presidential Range; 12 of those hours were spent above tree line, without a cloud in the sky.
For seemingly the first time on my entire hike, Mother Nature cut me a break. I was able to get up and over the steepest sections of the final mountain, Mt Moriah, Sunday morning just minutes before the rain started. The last 3 miles into Gorham, NH was a nice, even, gradual downhill that actually had DIRT! Only then did I realize why I was so exhausted; I hadn’t actually “walked” in 100 miles, I had been rock climbing. The uphills require you to put the trekking poles down so you can grab rocks, roots, or trees to hoist yourself up. It is the same with the downhills, which is why I wanted to get through before the rain made things infinitely more difficult. Even the parts that look flat on the elevation profile are massive boulder fields that are impossible to navigate through going the speed that I am accustomed to hiking.
Despite the physical torture, and what we call “character building”, this has been my favorite stretch of trail by far, and I am so thankful that I was able to have 6 days of absolutely perfect weather for it.

For the first week in my final state, it was the same routine every day; Hot, humid and sunny in the valleys, then the rumbling of thunder just before summiting the next mountain. Many hours were spent hunkered down at the edge of tree line getting drenched and waiting for storms to pass, then sprinting over the mountains before the next storm rolled in. If only I had a dollar for every time I said or thought “I bet this is probably beautiful up here.” Other than days I’ve spent in town with a roof over my head, I think I’ve only been dry for a total of a day and a half. And even still, my shoes remain wet due to all of mud and swollen streams. I thought Washington had the only temperate rainforest in the United States? Maybe someone kidnapped me and I’m actually in Olympic National Park? But what should I expect. The word of the entire trip has been “unseasonable”. Unseasonable cold temps into mid April, unseasonable forest fires, then flooding in May, unseasonable heat in Vermont in early July, and now record rainfalls in Maine after a local pointed out “We have been in a drought the past few summers, this is very rare.”
Perhaps this is all part of the lesson to appreciate a roof over my head and climate control once the journey ends. As promised, my mileage has significantly reduced, I have been fishing when possible, and now I’m only 188 miles from the finish line. Despite the conditions, I’m still not ready for this to be over.

Luckily, a trail angel was at the trailhead in his camper, and invited us, along with 2 other hikers in to ride out the storm. The plan was to conquer the last of the difficult terrain in Maine (aside from Katahdin) today. An easy 10 miles, 3 climbs, no problem, right? Wrong. After climbing South Horn we started up Bigelow West peak. Ominous dark clouds and thunder greeted us right at tree line, as per usual. Another sprint over a bald 4,000 peak was in order. As beautiful as these last 2 climbs were, no time for pictures. Luckily, there was a campsite right in between West Peak and Avery peak. Still kind of unnerving setting up a tent just below tree line during a storm at almost 3,900 feet. 
To make up the miles we lost dodging storms the day before, we got an early start and climbed Avery Peak, the last of the 4,000 footers until Katahdin. A short, scenic walk to Little Bigelow finally freed us from the 227 miles of bouldering and rock climbing that started at Mt Moosilauke 25 days ago. As an added bonus, I found the largest and most plentiful blueberries yet. For 2 days, I carried 1L of water, and 1L of blueberries in my other water bottle.
The next 60 miles into Monson is what I am referring to as the “Maine super highway”. This stretch is mostly flat, mostly dirt, with minimal rocks and roots (as compared to what was behind me at least). It is so great to walk at a pace of 3mph without much effort again. I am actually able to look up in most sections and try to see wildlife, as opposed to staring at my feet, carefully placing each step. Other hikers have shown me pictures and video of moose the have seen, but I still have only seen poop and the occasional print in the mud.

Stupidly, I said “I’m only taking 5 days worth of food because I have my fishing rod, we’ll be fine”.  Let me also clarify the 100 mile wilderness isn’t that “wild”. I was actually quite disappointed in the amount of people we say on the private logging roads, and just out for the day hiking. I knew there was a hostel a little over half way through that served over priced burgers and pizza, but I was stubborn at determined to let this 100 mile stretch be as wild as possible and receive no aid. (There was also the option to pay to have Shaw’s drop off a resupply to you on the logging roads). I quickly learned that fishing would be much more difficult than expected. These lakes get too cold in the winter to support a good bass population, and the trout and landlocked salmon are hundreds of feet deep in the lakes this time of year. The river/streams/brooks connect all of the lakes together. The right time of the year, these trout and salmon come into the rivers to spawn, but not in the heat of August.
As I hike with a rationed food supply, I feel very weak, and even this easy terrain becomes difficult. I have difficulty sleeping with a rumbling stomach. Just as I decide I’m going to have to stop at that hostel after all, we meet a gem named Rowdy. A former thru-hiker, and injured attempted thru-hiked this year. She is spending the remainder of the hiking season doing trail magic, and in the middle of the 100 mile “wilderness”, she flagged us down and fed us sausage McMuffins and PBR! I think I ate about 4 and packed 2 out. This was a huge mental and physical boost, and this allowed me to have enough food to finish the wilderness without having to divert the plan.
All through the wilderness, there were signs for “Katahdin view”, and only once did we actually see the full mountain (I went to look, and it was in clouds, then sunshine yelled for me to come back as it cleared up for a few minutes). We finished the 100 mile wilderness at Abol bridge, and stop in the restaurant for some real food. A guy at the public campground offered us his spot (the best spot at the campground) as he had to leave for family reasons. He left us home grown veggies, homemade pickles, and cut firewood for us. What a guy! The store attached to the restaurant sold brauts and buns, so we grilled those up for dinner that night, and for dinner the next night. The plan was to hike 9 miles the next day to the base of Katahdin, and summit on the 22nd. Around 10am on the 21st, about a mile before we get to camp, Sunshine is waiting in the middle of the trail and says “How do you feel about summiting today? It’s going to be bad tomorrow.” It didn’t take long for us to agree to finish today, and after registering with the ranger, we were on our way up by 11am. The first 2.6 miles were pretty easy, and then we hit tree line. 1.5 miles of rock climbing and rebar ladders. After a valiant 112 miles, Greenbag realized that his knee just couldn’t handle going back down this stuff. I asked him to do more than anyone without 2,188 miles of practice could be capable of (But it was necessary due to the food and storm situation). So he sent us on our way and made his way back down. Though Katahdin isn’t the highest mountain on the trail, you ascent 4,180 feet in 5.2 miles, by far the highest top to bottom climb within that distance. About 1 mile from the summit (the longest mile of my life), a big cloud rolls through and hinders my view of the sign. Then, all of a sudden, there it is. The weight of my pack is seemingly lifted as I can finally see what I’ve been walking towards for the past 5 months, 2 weeks, and 1 day. I thought for sure I would cry my eyes out when I finally saw that sign, but I think I was just in complete shock instead.
I finished the Appalachian Trail on 8/21/18 at 3:06pm. I never once skipped even the most insignificant portion of trail, and carried the full weight of my pack the entire way; something that an overwhelming majority of people (who are still considered thru-hikers) cannot say. Not everyone has what it takes to be a “purist” ;).
There were a few other thru-hikers that were up there, most having finished as well. I spent an hour up there taking pictures and eating the 5 cheddar brauts I precooked for that night, not intending to summit today. All finished right? Nope, there’s no roads or train up here, it’s 4,180 feet back down to the campground. We took a different path down for different scenery, and it was a little shorter (but steeper). Sunshine’s family met us at the very bottom, armed with all of the proper picnic supplies. Staying in Millinocket with them the next 2 nights, then back to reality again I guess.","Shaw’s hostel, Monson, ME

Beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601628,"Over the past five months, two weeks, and one day, I have hiked more miles, slept under the stars more nights, saw more amazing things, and pushed my body to the limit more than most people will do in a lifetime. I endured six painful weeks of below freezing temperatures and subzero windchills, blizzards and knee deep snow from Georgia to southern Virginia. Followed closely by 90 degree temperatures and outrunning forest fires in middle to northern Virginia. Then, two straight weeks of rain, flooding, and shin deep mud from northern Virginia to Maryland. Two more weeks of 90 degree weather, with heat indexes over 110 degrees through Vermont. Finally, three weeks of heat, humidity, rain, lightning bolts, and near-vertical rock climbs that had been turned into waterfalls in Maine. These are the unpredictable challenges I faced, that are on top of the predictable challenges that is a 2,190.9 mile hike through 14 states.
I am amazed more than ever by the body’s ability to endure and to heal, as I watch most of my newly purchased equipment be reduced to rubble from the day after day wear and tear. Despite feeling like the tribute on The Hunger Games that the game maker wanted dead for over 5 months, I can honestly say there was not a single day where I entertained the idea of quitting. I finish the trail now mentally and physically stronger than I have ever been, and I glow with the confidence of knowing it will take a hell of a lot to kill me. In the brief time I have had to reflect on the completion of this journey, I remember much more vividly the sunsets, wildlife, waterfalls, stars, and the amazing people I met and relationships that were formed, and remember much less how cold, wet, hot and smelly I was.
I would like to share one of the many valuable lessons I on the trail: I realized that throughout our lives, there is always this burning desire to get to the end. To get to the end of a 4 hour drive, to get to the end of the day, to get to the weekend, to get to retirement, to get to the end of the Appalachian Trail. No one would say they want to get to the end of their life, but those things you are trying to get to the end of is all part of your life. You should value each day, and take something memorable from it. If you are just trying to get the day over with, what’s the point? Drive a different way home and maybe you’ll see something new. Go out of your way to help someone and see the smile on their face. Get out of your mundane routine of waking up, going to work, eating dinner, watching the news, and going to bed until you get to the weekend. 
And to those hikers who hiked the trail super fast just to say you did, get out of the routine of waking up with the sunrise, and walking as far and as fast as you can until dark. Take that one tenth of a mile side trail to see the beautiful mountain that is about to destroy your legs. Enjoy a nice view for an hour, or jump in that mountain lake!
Throughout my journey, there were countless people that helped me in different ways. My parents, family, and friends who sent me care packages, hiked with me, took me out for a night on the town, and the constant words of encouragement; I cannot thank you enough! As you’ve seen in my previous posts, it was amazing how many complete strangers also go out of their way to help hikers. I am in your debt! You are all trail angels, and you have not only taught me to give back when you can, but to also pay it forward.
It took me so long to put up this final post, because it is still all so overwhelming, and it is hard to put it all into words. I will say, this way of life I lived since March is matched by nothing else. Though it is, without a doubt, not sustainable long term. So I shall return to what society views as how you “should” live your life, having gained a completely different perspective on what really is important. This all comes with the hope of someday returning to the woods to see what more it has to teach me.
“I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.” -Henry David Thoreau",,New York,"Aug 28, Tue",0
Beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607649,"One year ago today was one of the most challenging days of my life. My loving parents drove me from Pittsburgh, ever closer to the trailhead at Amicolola Falls State Park, GA. I did my best to pretend to be strong for them. The pouring rain camouflaged my tears quite well I think. I had just given up everything that was guaranteed and comfortable in my life; on purpose, to pursue something with no defined reward, and an 80% fail rate. I hiked alone into the unknown on Tuesday, March 6th, 2018. 4 short hours later, at 2:00pm, I would summit Springer Mountain, GA, the southern terminus and official start of the Appalachian Trail.
Somewhere along the 2,190.9 mile hike though 14 states from Georgia to Maine, I learned that the reward I sought could not be defined because it simply is immeasurable. Strength is not measured by how heavy of a bar you can pick up and put back down a few times at the gym. Strength is measured by how much you can endure beyond when your mind and body are screaming at you to quit; all day, every day. It didn’t take me 169 consecutive days of physical and mental perseverance to realize conquering the unknown, never giving up, and pursuing your dreams are the keys to happiness. I just wanted to milk that feeling for as long as I could.
I stood atop the infamous sign on Mount Katahdin, ME, the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail on Wednesday, August 21st, 2018 at 1:00pm. Don’t get me wrong, it felt amazing. But it was not the climax I had been expecting for the previous 5 and a half months. Getting my picture taken here did not change my life the way I thought it would. Where was the reward?
Only recently have I realized it was the 5 million steps taken between Springer Mountain and Mount Katahdin that was the reward. This is what really changed my life. The weather and terrain that I refused to let destroy me, the random acts of kindness bestowed upon me, the goodness and selflessness of people, and the amazing relationships I formed along the way are what will positively influence my life forever.
When you work this hard for something, nothing can ever take those feelings away from you. It truly is not the destination you should seek, it is every step taken to get there, and the experiences along the way.
I went into the woods expecting nothing, but gained everything. This is what my hike was all about. When you don’t let your fears and challenges dictate your life, only then can you truly live.",,"Jackson, Wyoming","Mar 06, Wed",0
Beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626879,"Two years ago today at this time, I found myself standing around a warm campfire on a cold night in northern Georgia, sipping on my favorite beer, Dogfish Head 120 minute IPA. There were about 14 of us at the shelter that night, all Appalachian Trail thru-hiker hopefuls. After dark, there were only 4 of us left by the fire. One of them said “you know, statistics say only 1 of the 4 of us will make it to Katahdin, who’s it going to be?” We all thought it would be ourselves, and we were all right. To the best of my knowledge, all 4 of us completed our thru hike in 2018. As for the other 10, they were not enjoying the fire and a great beer, but instead were in bed, preparing for another grueling day of hiking. I can only confirm one of the other 10 finished, and I can definitely confirm several did not. So the overall ratio pretty much checks out.
Everyone was astonished that I would carry a full bottle of beer 12.6 miles up Springer Mountain to the shelter, just to drink it by the fire on my first night. Honestly, the worst part was packing out the empty bottle for a few days until the first trash can at Neel Gap. The hikers at the shelter that first night who went to bed early were hiking it just to say they did it, not to enjoy and embrace the experience. They were even more flabbergasted when I said “It’s going to be more impressive when I carry one through the 100 mile wilderness and up Katahdin. Well, I did. (Even though my friend Evan volunteered to carry it the 100 miles until the Baxter State Park entrance for me). I saw this attitude in New Hampshire and Maine, at the end of their epic hikes far too much. Swarms of miserable people just trying to get it done and not enjoying it. Those people undoubtedly had regrets after they finished.
In the 2 years that have passed since I started my hike, I’ve found it much more relevant to celebrate the start of my hike, rather than the finish. I feel the start my hike took way more courage than it did to finish it. I had to give up all that I had worked for in my career, knowing there was no guarantee of finding a job that was as good as the one I had just willingly left. I gave up my friends, a relationship, and a secure job and housing in New York, and knew I would have to start over when I was done. But once I was on the trail, I loved it so much and I knew there was nothing that would stop me from completing it. Finishing my hike only took stamina and will power, not courage.Now I am celebrating the second anniversary of starting my thru hike, and I did the same thing, but double the distance of the hike. It took me a while to get into a state of reflection this time. I feel like it had been so long ago, and I almost couldn’t relate to what I was doing 2 years ago, or even 1 year ago. I was trying to reflect on my hike, and force myself to wish I was starting the AT again. It was not working. I was just sitting in deep snow on the backside of Snowking Mountain with a great beer and my ski boots on. Only once I started focusing on what I’ve accomplished since my hike did I start to feel anything significant. And there it was... I can honestly say I’m glad I am where I am now, and not starting another thru hike. My long term goal is to get my triple crown, which is hiking the AT, CDT, and PCT. But I’m very happy where I am now. Jackson has been amazing. I am 5 times more active than I was in NY with all the skiing, snowboarding, hiking, volleyball, hockey, backpacking, fly fishing, mountain biking, you name it. The mindset and competitive nature of everyone here is what I need. This area continues to amaze my by how beautiful it is. I work for a private clinic for great people, and with great people. It’s  something I never thought I would find in healthcare.
A lot of people have asked me if I wished I was starting another thru hike again this year. My answer is a simple “Nah, I’m good... I’m really good”. Hopefully someday I’ll be in a place to challenge myself for another 2,000+ mile hike, but I love where I am right now. The trails will always be there, and I’ll be more than ready when the time is right.",,Leeks Canyon,"Mar 06, Fri",7
Beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636346,"March 6th is a very important day to me. More important than Thanksgiving,  Christmas, and even my own birthday. March 6th, 2018 is the day that I began my thru hike of the Appalachian Trail....
My happy place... It’s 9:00pm on a Saturday, and I have spent the past 1+ hours bootpacking, from the base of Snowking Mountain to the summit with my snowboard on my back. No lift service at this hour, and the night skiing lights have long been shut off. I travel uphill without my headlamp on because the clear skies and the full moon light up the snow as if it were dawn or dusk. I get to the top, all alone, and the only thing disturbing the peace is the howling wind blowing north east over the peak just behind me. It is cold. The sweat is quickly freezing to my body in the wind. I transition my ski setup from uphill to downhill mode as quickly as I can, and descend the first 100 feet into the double black diamond “S Chutes”. I pull off to the side, on the edge of the thick pine trees lining the narrow, steep run. Here, I am sheltered from the wind coming over the backside of the mountain, but I can still hear the subtle roar. It is much warmer here out of the wind, and I can recover from the long uphill climb. I can hear a distinctly different roar of the bustling, small town of Jackson some 1,500 feet below me. I can see my house from here (literally), and that’s what makes this so special. I sit there, by myself, and rejoice in how lucky I am to live in such a beautiful place; literally in my back yard. I sit in awe and peace for at least 20 minutes, or until I start to get cold again. Now it’s time to shred. I’ll crank my headlamp up to its max setting of 350 lumens and pick my way through over 1,500 vertical feet of knee deep, Wyoming “cowboy powder”. The top half is usually totally untouched, because you have to work hard to get to this part of the mountain. The extra effort is almost always worth it. I’ll ski down to my truck in the parking lot, which is only about 3 blocks from my house. But before I go home, I’ll walk just across the street to the brewery to sip on an IPA. I’ll look back up the mountain from there and admire my fresh tracks from top to bottom. This is exactly what I was looking for when I moved here.
I miss the trail life, and hope to do another thru hike in the future... but I continue to be so beyond happy here.
