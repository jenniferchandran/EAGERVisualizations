Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593377,"The last time I was on the trail was 2005. I tried, in 2016, to hike the 200 plus mile section from Hot Springs to Damascus only to have to cancel due to forest fires along the section I was going to hike. I tried again in 2017 and another cancellation. But, 2018 came and I waited until the last minute waiting for something to happen that would cause me to cancel again, but it didn't happen...YES! 
I found myself sitting on a bed, in room 5, of Sunnybank Inn, in Hot Springs, NC. The smells of dinner making their way up the shoe worn, dark wooden staircase to the second floor, which was dressed in old carpets and rows of bookshelves with titles of any subject you could think of. The 1875 Victorian house rooms and walls hold decades of memorabilia and memories. After 3 years I felt like I'd hiked the section of the AT from Hot Springs to Damascus mentally several times, and now I was actually about to put my hiking boots on and start.","Hot Springs

Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592802,"It was a steep, hard climb out of Hot Springs. Trail was muddy and there were lots of roots, rocks and turns to watch for. My legs ached and I was so tired and sore when I arrived at Spring Mountain Shelter that I just sat down and drank water for awhile. Met up with Nurp, Pilot, and Organic.  I hate to think how I would have felt if I hadn't trained for 4 months with weights, pilates, yoga, and treadmill hills. I'm slow but I got here!  I pitched my tent  on a knoll above the shelter and joined other hikers around a large campfire. There was a large group of weekend hikers called  ""Bounty"" they were identifying and collecting edible plants and made soup from them to share with anyone who wanted a taste. I wasn't hungry but nibbled on a power bar and drank some powdered milk before going down to filter water for tomorrow.","Hot Springs

Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592803,"The uphills are hard for me, my gait is short. I keep telling myself to lengthen my stride but the Trail won't let me. (Is there a life lesson here?) 
Little Laurel Shelter is at the base of Camp Creek Bald a steep uphill I will do in the morning. Learned about Usnea from ""Melt Down"" today. It is a type of moss that grows on trees and has antibiotic properties. I'll have to look it up later. Also saw a red bird with black wings, very striking. I don't have cell service though others may. Verizon seems to be the carrier that has coverage. I have AT&T. 
Looking out from my spot in the shelter I note that no one is ""connected"" tonight. There is a fire crackling and being fed outside the shelter and incense slowly burning inside. Hikers seem absorbed in their personal moments or soft conversation  as the full moon rises, it's light trading places with that of the sun.","Spring Mountain Shelter

Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592804,"It got down into the 30's last night and I woke up feeling chilled. I told myself ""Barb get up! Get hiking! before you really get cold. So I did"".  Took me about 2 hours to finally warm up my feet and hands. I could see my breath when I started out.  The uphill out of Little Laurel wasn't bad but the 1.4 mile ALL ROCK section of the Ridgeline Trail was awful! Had to really watch my every step. 
Was taking a quick break at Jerry Cabin Shelter when 2 great Danes came lopping in followed by TRAIL MAGIC! This hiker said he regularly hikes this section and he brought little baggies with fig bars, tangerines, and candy in them. I high graded the fig bars and 2 of the 3 tangerines from one bag and gave the rest to another hiker.
First day on the Trail I wondered ""What did I get myself into?"" Second day was short and I was able to relax a little. Today, the third day, I felt I was able to keep a more steady pace on flats and short uphills. So I was feeling pretty good, plus I was half way to my hostel stay at Uncle Johnny's. I also started to recognize and got to know a few of the hikers that I saw at the shelters and who passed me, by their trail names.","Little Laurel

Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592805,"There seemed to be more up hills than the map showed today. I have been hiking pretty much all alone during the day. I rise early and am usually at my destination early to mid afternoon. Thru hikers seem to be rising later and arriving later. I am using zip fizz in my water for electrolytes, others I noticed use Emergent C. Hogback Shelter was really nice, easy water source. It felt good to go down stream a bit and just soak my feet. Days are getting warmer. I know I need to drinking more water. Because my pack's water bottle sleeves can't be accessed except by taking off my pack I had a tendency to not drink as much as I should. I wasn't hungry the first 3 days of the hike but now I was starting to think about orange juice-- volumes of orange juice.","Flint Mountain Shelter
",Hogback Ridge Shelter,"Apr 30, Mon",9.80
Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592806,"I had a Fitbit on and it was always showing a mile or two more than what the maps indicated. Guthook is an app many of the hikers have and it tells a different story of the mileage, as do the paper maps I carry, so I've concluded that each mile of the Appalachian trail is not only different in topography (the amounts of ups/downs/rocks/roots) but also mileage value:)
Big Bald views were beautiful and I felt like I had really accomplished a number of goals. I had climbed to over 5500 ft, passed 300 AT miles back at Jerry Shelter, and I was one day away from completing the first of the 4 segments that I had broken my hike into. I felt great!!  Took picture with Wisco, DJ, and Dat Boi at Big Bald.
At Sam's Gap, Trail Magic was occurring but I was a little early. A group of men were setting up to cook hot dogs and hamburgers. I can't hike on a full stomach so I thanked them for what they were doing and started to cross the road for the climb on the other side when a woman approached me. She was taking trail names and where hikers were from for her records. Her trail name was Elmo. Elmo had items for resupplying hikers in the back of her SUV for a small cost and as I looked at the array of choices, there slightly hidden by 3 bananas was an orange! OMG, I bought it and an apple and happily carried the weight up the hill.
Today I learned about the different ""Blazes"": White Blazes mark the AT but there is also ""yellow Blazing"" that is when you use roads to skip parts of the trail. There are others that I'll have to look up: Red, Pink, Blue. I am also finding out I am not hungry for the food I brought- mainly soup. Pilot bread and peanut butter and honey sounds really good but I only have the pilot bread. Love the dried apples I made at my daughter's. Trail Magic has provided variety that is getting me through.","Hogback Shelter

Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592807,"Beautiful day, hot, ups and downs, not bad, I took frequent breaks. One was at Spivey Gap where there was this perfect oblong rock across a stream. I ate the orange I saved from Sam's Gap yesterday while sitting on the rock and soaking my feet. The climb up to High Rocks was brutal along with the downhill rocks but there were lots of waterfalls, birds, dwarf irises back in the landscape, MountainLaurel, Hemlock, and pines.  The water source was down a steep ravine and I had planned on filling up before I got to the Shelter but I didn't realize I was so close and arrived with what I had. 1 1/2 liters.
I was relaxing, reviewing my hike so far and the people I've met. I was the only one at the shelter at 4pm. Then Mt. Goat (yes long white hair and beard) and Ariel (worked at REI in Spokane) came in. Everyone was chatting and setting up tents, when around 7pm this skinny guy wearing flag shorts and a black T with head phones and a head lamp dangling around his neck and broken in tennis shoes strides into camp from the direction of Erwin. He dropped a pack, pulled out two foot long pork loins, bottles of sauces, and a bottle of alcohol. His companion pulled out a pineapple!  They rapidly assembled firewood, made a fire, reshaped an old grill that was there and began cooking the pork loin over the coals they made. Everyone watched in awe. No utensils, just two wood sticks to move and rotate the meat. They rolled cigarettes and told us they were cooking for a group that was on their way. Chop Sticks and Shadow were their trail names. The group didn't show by the time the first loin was ready so he offered it up along with the pineapple to all of us. It was delicious! Chop Sticks, we were told, was legally blind and paddled the Mississippi River last year. By the time the second loin was done to perfection  his friends had arrived. That was an amazing piece of Shelter Magic: Impromptu Luau.","Bald Mountain Shelter

Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592808,"In the morning Mt. Goat said he was going down for water, and he noted that I was low, so he said he would bring me back some. The trail and wonderful fellow hikers will provide. With the water I received from him, I didn't have to stop until I got to Uncle Johnny's. 
The hike from No Business Knob Shelter to Uncle Johnny's was very nice and easy and there were some great views of the Nolichucky River. When I arrived there were tangerines sitting on the hiker table for the taking and I found size 7 Crocks in the hiker discard box just for me. I gratefully changed out of my hiking boots and slipped them on. Thank-you to whoever left them.  A free shuttle went into town at 2pm so I went in to get a few food supplies and 32 oz of orange juice. I thought I'd drink half today and half tomorrow........It was gone in 2 hours!
I woke each day on the AT to the songs of birds, the hammering of the woodpeckers and the hoots of owls. I'd learned to hang my bear bag the PCT way and learned not to put too many bags from one line or I wouldn't be able to pull hard enough to get them down. Also learned the term  ""in the economy"" meaning those individuals not hiking the AT.","No Business Knob Shelter
",Uncle Johnny's,"May 03, Thu",7.60
Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593090,"I was going to take a zero at Johnny's but I got to thinking about the 15 or so miles I was setting myself up  hike the next day. I decided not to zero and instead hike the short 5.6 miles to Curley Maple Gap Shelter. Many hikers stopped to have lunch and rest but continued on. There were at least 5 foot bridges over swift tumbling streams with waterfalls, moss covered rocks and over hanging vegetation tumbling their way down the steeply slopping hillsides. I almost walked over a rat snake making its way across the trail. I put my trekking pole right down by it's head before I realized what it was then, pulled back very rapidly! 
I was amazed at the number of hikers I'd seen smoking. My feet were still sore at the end of each day. I thought about those crocks I used at Johnny's and left behind. I changed food items at Johnny's adding tortillas, peanut butter, 2 tuna pkgs, 2 snickers, and 3 tangerines. I found I was only using my stove for hot chocolate or tea and not for cooking. There were no privies or bear cables at Curley Maple. Hanging my bear bag this time, I was able to get my limb in 3 tries! Note to self: the rock you tie your line to has to be heavy enough to actually bring the line down to you from the limb. I had to coax it down to a point where I could actually reach it!","Uncle Johnny's

Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593091,"Left Curley Maple by 7 am. The first part of the trail was undulating and pretty nice for longer strides and and making time. I hiked alone all day with only 3 hikers passing me. I found I liked it when I knew there were people behind me who would be passing me in case I found myself in need. It rained lightly as I ascended Unaka. I looked for the stand of Red Spruce at the top and was surprised to see a decorated Christmas tree. I found out later that it was a memorial put up by a father who lost his son. The day's hike was long and challenging, and I was so grateful that I had used my zero day to get ahead on today's mileage. It surprised me then to find all these hikers at the shelter when I arrived at 4pm. 
Tonight as I relaxed at the shelter, chatter was mostly about starting a blog about ""what hikers eat"" with suggestions of Spam & Mac & Cheese Tortilla wrap and the ""AT Slide"" which is Knorr noodles and sauce made with extra water, to which you add your favorite protein (tuna, spam), and mash potatoes. At 6:30 pm rain started in earnest. ""Now is when we see who won the lottery,"" someone in the shelter yelled, meaning we would see if the shelter roof leaks.  Nobody won.","Curley Maple Gap Shelter
",Cherry Gap,"May 05, Sat",12.20
Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593093,"Rainy and cool today with the trail having moderate ups and downs; I must have been getting my hiker legs. Feet were still get sore and started to talk to me after about 7 miles. I knew I had to get water before the shelter because the water source at Clyde Smith was weak. I stopped at the ""Plaque"" figuring the shelter was near. Spacebear then passed me afterwards saying it was 2 miles away. What! I had 2 liters of H2O, and that was 4 pounds of water weight that I was carrying. I felt the weight difference. Being the person I am I trudged on. When I finally got to the shelter, someone just coming back from getting water stated, ""That climb back from the water source is worse than Unaka!"" (the steep uphill and down hill we had all done) I thought that despite the weight, I was glad I had my 2 liters. 
We were 5 in the shelter, dry, warm, and out of the rain which finally ended and allowed us to make a fire from a meager assortment of dry to damp wood. The evening slowly overtook the day, and we were all sleeping, when around 10:30 pm two guys came in with a dog. There was no room for two in the shelter and the space that was there was for those in the upper bunks to get down from. After a rapid exchange of words between them, one of the guys left and the other plus the dog took over the exit for the upper bunks right between me and Toast.  I have to say the dog was well mannered and the hiker was perceptive of the position and situation he had created.  All went well.

Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593094,"What a day this was! Trail to Hughes Gap was not bad, including the first part of Roan Mountain to Ash Gap. The switchbacks were our friends. The last 1 1/2 miles however were steep, rocky and slow.  I almost missed the sign to Roan High Knob Shelter as the white blazes were few and far between. Then came the first time I thought I was lost. The AT follows a wide rocky bed that switchbacks and the blazes are non existent. I hiked on and on looking for the next blaze. I took my map and compass out twice to check. This HAS to be the trail I tried convincing myself, not feeling the confidence I wanted. Just when a panicky feeling started to claw it's way into my brain and fear loomed, another 50 yards further-- there painted brightly was the AT White Blaze. I could have strangled that tree for making me feel so lost!!  
Carvers Gap was a disappointment. I thought there would be a picnic table to sit and enjoy or maybe even a bathroom but no, just a privy and an asphalt parking lot full of  cars. As I hiked up Round Bald I met a woman who had a basket full of ramps. She shared a bit of her knowledge on how to identify them in the wild and cautioned not to eat too many as they can ""clean you out."" 
I arrived at Stan Murray Shelter around 4:30 pm and was the only person there for a short while when Castaway and JBeebs arrived. I greeted them with ""Whew, I'm glad there is going to be someone else at the shelter tonight."" But they said they were heading 1.9 miles to Over-Mountain Shelter. 
""You should too. It is an old Red Barn."" I told them that I had already gone 14 plus miles and didn't know if I could make it another 1.9 before it got dark. ""I'm really slow."" 
""Yes you can, there is plenty of daylight!"" I told them about my experience of feeling lost and asked them if the Shelter was well marked. They thought it was well marked, though it was off the trail. I asked if they could mark it for me just in case. ""Sure we'll put sticks in the trail."" 
So they started off with me right behind. I soon lost sight of them. I was nervous, a bit scared but kept reminding myself I had 2 liters of water and everything I needed in my pack. The trail was amazing, dirt and down hill! I got to Yellow Mountain Gap and there in the middle of the trail were a group of branches and etched in the dirt SHELTER ->->->. I headed down the side trail and arrived at the Big Red Barn. Castaway and J Beebs greeted me ""Wow you came in just 7 minutes behind us."" 
I thanked them for the ""sign"" and taking care of me. ""That is what adrenaline and and a little bit of fear can do!""
During dinner I was exchanging some observations I'd made while hiking, when Sticks (Stix?) made one of his own. ""You know my hike has been pretty tame but not since you've been here. First there was the pork loin Luau, second ""Turtle"", the older guy dancing to his own ear plug music, and then last night with the late arrival of the two guys with the dog. I had to admit all those events happened.
I had a beautiful view from my sleeping bag, big bright moon, hikers around a campfire and a realization that I had miscalculated and would arrive at Harbour Mountain B&B tomorrow and not the day after. A zero day loomed.","Clyde Smith Shelter
",Stan Murry/ Over-mountain Shelter,"May 07, Mon",16.10
Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593187,"There are those who's presence at a shelter taint the atmosphere. Fortunately they are a rarity. Such was a couple that stayed at the Red Barn last night. It wasn't enough to hear the abusive, condescending language they used towards each other, but they seemed oblivious to the effect they were having on those around them. ""I've always been an assertive woman and most people don't like that,"" she said aloud to the group, unaware that her full comments were being taken as aggression not assertiveness. There is a distinct difference, and while most hikers use earphones to listen to their music or favorite monologues, these two broadcasted their choices for all to hear.  The irritation was felt not only by me but, in comments made around the campfire late at night, after they had retired. They were the reason I packed up and left earlier than I would have. They had a toxic effect on me as well as the other hikers.    
A morning sun's glow came through the mist-shrouded Balds that I viewed from my sleeping area. The birds woke me early with their songs, and hammering  and the duo mentioned above, with their electronics and verbal crassness, sent me quickly packing and on my way.  The Balds were partially clear, then became socked in, and the air temp was cool, making me hike fast to keep warm. I had a hat and gloves on but no jacket.  I met 2 older gentlemen along the way who were staying at the Harbor Mountain B & B. ""Maybe we'll see you. Oh, just over that Bald it's a nice easy down hill trail."" That knowledge lightened my step and outlook. 
One thing I have now learned is not to completely believe others who tell you their interpretation of the trail without thoroughly understanding how they came to that interpretation. Six miles later, after I negotiated rocks, roots, and braided trails with poor markings over the Balds, I arrived at the last 3 miles of the trail which were the ""easy downhill"" they had described.  Someone had also told me there were restrooms at Carver Gap. There aren't, unless you call a composting toilet a ""restroom"".
I dug up a ramp along the way. They are very juicy with a garlic-onion flavor. I see why people around here collect them. I was also told there are ramp festivals.
I arrived at Harbor Mountain B & B at 1pm. successfully having carried only 3/4 of a liter of water for this section. I had passed up a water source around 3 miles out and arrived thirsty. The B & B stood back from the road picturesque and welcoming, complete with a resident billy goat.  I ordered my first real meal from the food truck there, a California chicken sandwich with avocado, a side salad and a peach pear Lipton tea. I enjoyed every bite of the sandwich and saved the salad for evening.","Over Mountain Shelter
",Habour Mountain B & B,"May 08, Tue",10.80
Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593385,"Took my first zero day at Harbour Mountain B & B and Hostel. Hikers raved about the breakfast served here, so my curiosity was high when I arrived for it at the food truck. They did not exaggerate. I should have taken a picture of the menu: scrambled eggs, egg casserole, blueberry pancakes, seasoned hash browns, bacon, sausage, fruit, danish and more.
I had a room in the B & B which was located up a long steep set of stairs. The hostel portion was down by the driveway and it was beautiful and quaint inside, with lacquered pine. There was plenty of space outside to pitch tents. 
Mountain Goat came in during the afternoon. I had met him on the trail before Uncle Johnny's. He had been nursing a sore ankle when he got there, but here he was after a 25 mile day. His ankle was still swollen. By late afternoon the place was full, and tents were scattered around and along the stream that ran alongside the hostel. Evidently hikers had been held up by a fire just before Hot Springs. They were now back on the trail. That explained the lack of hikers I was noting since I started.
I was feeling really good about what I had achieved so far. It hadn't been easy but here I was with only 75 or so miles left. While I hiked my mind wandered from family, to observations of the people i encounter, to events and conversations I'd had and how I could have said things better and in different ways. I thought about what really matters in the long run. It is never about what you have but who you are, what you learn, how you improve yourself, and what you do for others. I think about the beauty around me, simple yet complex pieces of nature. I analyze decisions I've made and how I got to this point, the challenges I've faced, the lessons I've learned just by living. Then I look up and see a white blaze on a tree and tap it with my trekking pole before moving forward. The past can't be changed, just learned from and move on.","Habour Mountain B & B

Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593674,"Breakfast was served at 8 am at the food truck in the parking area of Harbour Mountain B & B and Hostel. The menu was extensive. I drank as much orange juice as I could, had a little coffee and was first in line at the food truck. 
Shannon asked if I wanted the croissant we had talked about yesterday?  I said yes and received a large, piping hot,  croissant filled with eggs, cheddar cheese and ham. I asked for a piece of foil to wrap it in after I took a couple of savory tasting bites, then packed it away in my pack. 
It took me just under 6 hours to cover the 9.8 miles. I took the side trail to Joans Falls which cascaded over large boulders down the side of the mountain.  Had a few bites of my croissant for lunch there and visited with 3 other day hikers. Hardcore Cascade was the next tumbling, rushing stream, followed by Mountaineer Falls which dropped off a ledge and down over large rocks. The top of Mountaineer Falls was the water source for the shelter. There were large open meadows along the trail today, full of grasses, flowers and one white tailed deer.
As the day wound down and familiar hikers arrived, conversation turned to the section of the trail through the Smokey's. This year there was a late snow and wind storm that affected and delayed many hikers. Cosmic related that Tree Beard had told a story one night while they were waiting out the weather, that entranced everyone there. He had hikers give him: the name of a character, a place and a situation and he would then make up an interactive story. The hikers came up with the name FroggyTog (after the rain gear- Frog Toggs), the place was Rock Candy Mountain and the situation was FroggyTog had run out of ice cream.  Tree Beard weaved a story about FroggyTog and his quest to find ice cream that included a visit to each hiker present, requiring them to become part of the quest. Cosmic wanted Tree Beard to continue the story. Tree Bread was willing but wanted to start with a different set of circumstances. Unfortunately we never got around to it, but it did remind me of the game we played around the campfire when my kids, Jennifer and Joshua, were little. One person would start a story, setting the situation and characters and then at a point suddenly hand it off to the person next to them. It could get pretty far fetching and funny.","Harbour Mountain B&B and Hostel

I left the shelter at 6:44 am. The early start allowed me to go past Moreland Shelter to a beautiful campsite at an open meadow near a grove of tree and a piped stream just over a small rise. 
I was alone at the campsite for about 1 1/2 hours. Tok came in after an 18+ mile day and was tired, he said his friends were behind him and he would wait to see if they wanted to camp here. After about a half an hour he said he was making the decision and he set up his tent and built a fire. By 7 pm,  five of us were sitting around a low fire, Funnion, Tok, El Chapo, Mouse King and I. This was a totally different group. They played their favorite music, fortunately low, smoked their weed, and the conversation between them was speckled with the F word, so much so I couldn't really follow some of their conversations. 
""Do you smoke Gouda Girl"" El Chapo asked offering me his glass pipe in a friendly fashion.  I smiled and said ""No thank you, El Chapo"".

Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593901,"Wonderful 80 degree day, with a very demanding, rocky up and down trail, scattered with a variety of budding and full blooming flowers in orange, pinks and white. A turtle greeted me as I started out on the early uphills. The trail was a bit confusing above Laurel Falls but it takes a tight turn then travels steeply down, relentlessly over rocks to the pool at the base of the falls. There were few white blazes along the way. Once at the rocky beach area there was a white blaze which indicated northbound and southbound.  The northbound trail curved along the river's edge around a rock faced cliff and then started up. The bright spot during all the climbing was seeing the flowers along the way. They took my mind off the torturous trail.
I missed any sign for Laurel Falls Shelter and found myself at the base of Pond Mountain where I knew, from my map, I had four and a half miles of switchbacks and uphill ascents to tackle. On one steep climb I discovered two Lady Slipper Orchids standing proudly side-by-side. These flowers are not found very often. 
Pond Mountain was an absolute bear to climb, in the heat of the day, with a 25 pound pack! My feet really started to hurt from all the rock surfaces I was hitting with every step, and there were no spectacular views to enjoy despite the elevation gained.  I was passed by a number of hikers who slack packed Pond Mountain southbound so they had a shorter uphill segment then hiking it northbound.
Three miles of downhill brought me to Shook Rd, where I took a left turn and found myself at the base of a steep uphill driveway to my destination: Boots Off Hostel. My maps said 12.7 miles but my Fitbit reported 14.3 and I felt like I hiked a 20 mile day.","2.3 miles past Moorland Gap Shelter

Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593903,"I woke in my own ""Blue Tiny House"" at Boots Off. It was a very small cabin with a bunk over a double bed, so it can actually sleep three.  There was a small refrigerator with a corner table just inside the door and my gear was hanging on hooks all around me. It is Mother's Day and I called my stepmom. 
There are a lot of hikers at Boots Off. I was told that at times the owner, Jim, provides food and music. There was a fire in the fire pit area at night, which draws hikers together to chat and tell stories. Two shuttles into town allow hikers to pick up supplies and enjoy a Subway sandwich or pick up a salad at McDonalds. 
I walked over to Watauga Lake in the afternoon, with Teresa and Dawn, about .4 mile from Boots Off. Any talk of walking very far made me think of the impact on my feet, but I thought of the cold lake and how nice it would be to go and soak my feet while getting to know these two new hikers. The day had been hot, and when we returned to Boots Off I enjoyed washing up in the creatively constructed outdoor wash-tub shower. I visited with Dawn, Teresa, and Flag in the evening, around the fire pit, enjoying Jim's Mac & Cheese, Tater Tot casserole, fresh fruit, and cherry cheesecake. 
Reflections: I have been trying to focus on the experiences and opinions of other hikers and less on what I have done and may want to convey. 
It occurred to me while hiking along, that each day on the AT brings a new piece of environment,a new situation and unknowns. I don't know what is ahead when I leave my campsite each day, even though I can look at a map and see the names of places ahead, they are only letters on a page, a point in the future of the day.","Boots Off Hostel

Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594031,"Part One:
Just before I left Boots Off, about 7:30 am, a hiker named MacGyver came back into Boots Off carrying a hastily packed backpack. The story was he woke at 4 am to a black bear raiding the bear bag he had properly hung.   He explained he hung his food and cooking gear about 20 feet up a branch, but the bear got it down! He was at Watauga Lake Shelter about 1.5 miles away. This is a shelter that has had bear problems before, and hikers are told to avoid. With the help of hikers who had some extra gear and food, and the small store at Boots Off he was able to replace everything he had lost. I would meet him later at Vandeventer Shelter for part two. 
The realization that I was on my last section to Damascus crept into my thoughts as I hiked. I was really only 40+ miles from the goal I had set. Wow! My mind searched the memories of the last 18 days. My excitement and success, though a bit premature, made me smile and imagine what awaited me. 
It was a good day! The trail was not as easy as the topographic map made it to be, but the steep parts were at least short. It was sunny and in the high 80's. 
Vandeventer Shelter sat with it's back to a low natural rock wall, over which there was a view of the valley. The shelter had no privy, no picnic table and no bear cables. There were a few level tent sites by the rock wall behind the shelter, and in front of it, but otherwise the area to the right of the shelter and wall sloped down towards a rocky ledge drop off. 
Part Two: 
Macgyver arrived at Vandeventer late in the afternoon and hung his hammock just to the right of the shelter on that slight slope.  I was back by the rock wall enjoying the warmth of the sun and landscape when I turned and saw what I thought was a soccer ball rolling towards the ledge. I was to far away to stop it, so I watched, with the intent of seeing where it landed. Off the ledge, into the air it went, hitting jutting rocks along the way. It hit the ground near a downed log and rolled off into the brush of the forest below. I marked the spot and looked over to see Macgyver striding towards the ledge. 
""Was that your soccer ball?"" I asked, ""I know the spot where it disappeared but getting to it will be difficult.""
""Those were my sleeping quilts!"" MacGyver replied. ""Two of them!""
He had rolled his quilts and stuffed them in a compression sack which when cinched down was round enough to roll. He had set his hammock up and placed the ball of quilts down on the ground in just the right place to roll.   
MacGyver began to survey a route and prepare to descend the cliff, when Fiji, a young hiker that had watched the whole event unfold volunteered.
 ""Maybe I should go since you're. . .""
"". . . older,"" I finished, as he hesitated not wanting to offend.  
The retrieval was a success thanks to Fiji's agility and his friend who lowered a safety line over the ledge. I hesitate to think what might have happened if ""older"" MacGyver had attempted it. 
When I commented to MacGyver that he should beware, as that was the second piece of bad luck to have befallen him, and bad luck comes in threes. He replied,  ""Bad luck, not at all. The trail provided me with the food I needed, new gear, Fiji and you! I would call that good luck!""
Lesson learned: Perspective is everything.","Boots Off

Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594076,"I had a problem, which hit me hard today. Since I rise early and don't like to hike on a full stomach I have a tendency to just nibble occasionally while I hike. During the day I graze on items like, string cheese, peanut butter with crackers or Fig Newtons. I arrive early at my destinations usually by 3 to 5 pm hungry. During the last few days I had eaten my big meal by 5 pm instead of waiting until 7. The result was I had a big calorie gap growing throughout the hike but especially these last couple days.  
Today the high humidity, 80 degree temperatures, trail conditions, and low calories combined to make it a challenge to put one foot in front of another. My reserves were very low and I felt my energy waning in the heat.  In response, I focused on my tapping of the white blazes to tick off completed sections of the trail, took longer breaks, added electrolyte powder to my water and forced myself to eat more during my breaks. It was doubly important to pay attention to my situation because it was a 15 mile day.
I got to road 91 and was rewarded by Trail Magic! I picked out an icy cold orange Crush and relaxed with Dawn and Teresa before continuing the 3 miles to Double Springs Shelter. Tendinitis, on the top of my left foot, slowed my gait, on this stretch of fairly flat trail. As it was, I averaged the lightning speed of 1.5 miles/hour. 
The shelter (capacity 6) held hikers who had started earlier from road 91. None of the occupiers moved to make room, despite one of them stating, ""We can make room"".  The nonverbal communication was obvious and a disappointment to me since this was not my usual experience of trail behavior.  I probably would have declined a spot, not wishing to crowd anyone, but it would have been nice to see, at least a gesture of goodwill and intention of more than just one hiker. I waited until the rain eased to quickly set up my tent.","Vandeventer Shelter
",Double Springs Shelter,"May 15, Tue",15
Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594278,"It rained all night at Double Springs Shelter. In the morning, I was able to keep my tent dry and wipe my footprint down enough, to pack it away. The rain never stopped enough for me to dry off my rain fly, so I folded it, wrapped it in a bandana, and placed it on top of the waterproof bag in my pack. It rained all the way to Abingdon Gap Shelter. The trail had more ups and downs than I expected but nothing strenuous. 
I was determined to get to Abingdon Gap Shelter in time to secure a place inside and out of the rain. I hiked as fast as I could, counting the number of hikers that passed me and asking whether they were pushing thru to Damascus or stopping at the shelter.  I arrived, to an almost empty shelter in four and half hours. Quickly, I staked out a place, with my yellow Neo Air mattress, to secure my dry spot for the night. 
The air was cool and I was soaked through, so I changed into my fleece top, donned my Nano Puff Jacket and a hat to warm up. I hung my drenched top and rain jacket on a line under the eves, in the unconvincing hope, that they might dry out by morning. 
The hiker, who's gear was inside the shelter when I arrived, came walking in carrying his full water bottles and stated that the water source was a long way down the hill and it was a slippery climb back up. I pointed to the steading stream of water pouring from the end of the gutter on the shelter, and said, ""I got mine right there.""
""The gutter has scum and stuff growing in it,"" he replied.
 ""That is why we have filters,"" I responded.
A couple of other hikers had since come in and heard the exchange. Soon the other hikers were catching the rain water with their pots and bottles. 
Dawn and Theresa arrived, and after they settled in and changed out of wet clothes we played cribbage and chatted through the early afternoon. As more hikers arrived, we made adjustments for them to at least get out of the rain for awhile. 
A hiker from Japan got one of the last spots in the shelter. Her name was Knot Yet. She told me, she had been hiking with a small group when they met a day hiker. The day hiker had asked what everyone's trail name was. When it was her turn, she stated, ""Not yet."" The day hiker thought that was her trail name. When she tried to clarify that she didn't have a trail name yet, a member of her group said, ""You do now."" Knot Yet decided to change the spelling of it as a play on words. We talked on through the evening about her decision to hike the trail and the preparations she had made.
A short pause in the rain, around 3pm, allowed about 20 hikers to quickly erect their tents and hammocks. As the evening wore on, and the rain began again, people cycled into the shelter to cook, eat and tell stories. The conversations ranged from blisters to mice, to the plans everyone had for their time in Damascus. Everyone was looking forward to Damascus and Trail Days.","Double Springs Shelter

Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594280,"The morning started with partly sunny skies, and a shriek! Knot Yet, was in a frantic full body shake and waving hand motion right next to me. While she was repacking her pack, she discovered that a mouse had invaded her outer pack pocket, and chewed its way inside her pack and made a nest in her rain fly. And the mouse was still there! The mouse quickly abandoned the nice new nest and allowed Knot Yet to assess the damage. Her pack had been too close to one of the shelter supports; plus with drying lines and clothes hanging everywhere, the mice had many easy access routes. Mine hung free and survived. 
The trail was a nice ""walk in the woods"". I had decided to take my time during this last day of hiking to  nurse my sore left foot, to enjoy the quiet, and to remember the sites and smells of the forest. The location of the Virginia State line took me by surprise. I saw a sign ahead, but thought it was a side trail joining the AT.  When I realized where I was, an unexpected wave of emotions swept over me. I had hiked the trail between North Carolina and Tennessee intermittently for so long, that to actually be standing in a new state gave me a sudden overwhelming sense of accomplishment and energy. I was on the verge of entering Damascus, my self imposed, planned end point at the beginning of Trail Days 2018.
I saw tents and hikers along the trail before I actually saw the town. The trail eased its way gradually onto a grass lawn where a table under an event tent had been set up by One Way Ministries. A group of volunteers welcomed hikers as we arrived and informed us of Trail Day events, town information, and tickets to a free hiker dinner that evening.   I was told where the Tent City area was, and where free laundry and shower facilities awaited. I was surprised at the amount of information that was given in a short 3 minute span. I must have shown it because the gentleman that was talking to me asked  ""Are you okay?""  I responded ""Yes, I'm just overwhelmed at the amount of information you just related in such a short time!""
He offered to take me on a tour of the town which I readily accepted.  He dropped me off at the home base for the Ministries where I introduced myself to Linda and secured a ride to my hotel in Abingdon, ten miles away.","Abingdon Gap Shelter

Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594365,"I was going to walk around town a bit, but as I left the One Way Ministries home base, a group of ladies beckoned me over to enjoy snacks, free laundry and a shower. I donned, loner clothes, gave them the few pieces of clothing I had and entered a trailer complete with spotless shower stalls, soap, shampoo, and towels. 
As I sat outside waiting for my laundry, Citrus, Know Yet, and Bloodhound, Dawn and Theresa showed up and cycled through the showers. The sun came out and we all enjoyed drying out tents and eating and drinking what had been laid out for us. I threw away my soaked top from the day before, all my garbage (one quart size plastic bag), and recycled my plastic soda water bottles. I had gotten 14 nights of use from my large fuel canister and though it felt light it still had available fuel in it, so I put it in a hiker box.
Once in my own clothes, I headed off to buy sandals and search for my inscribed brick I had bought a couple of years ago.  I found E. Laurel Ave. with the assistance of a few locals and found my brick. I read many of the other bricks during my search. The sentiments expressed on the bricks were telling of friends, family, and those no longer physically here but always remembered.
On my way to dinner I met Remedy. He yelled out ""Hey! Gouda Girl!"" and gave me a big hug. He is such a nice, friendly, young man. He told me he had hurt his ankle on a rocky stretch about 24 miles from Damascus so he shuttled back to rest and enjoy Trail Days. 
I was in the first or three groups of hikers to enjoy the free dinner at the Fire House. There was fried chicken, mac & cheese, cold slaw, bread and desserts along with lemonade and water. The place was packed!

Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594444,"My first thought when I arrived in Damascus by shuttle from Abingdon was to find the coffee shop called MoJo's and order the cappuccino I had been looking forward to.  I was surprised to find out that you can get breakfast and lunch as well as your favorite brew! It was 9 am so I stuck with my cappuccino. 
Met up with Remedy and a few other hikers as I wandered through a multitude of vendors, informational organization tents, and book authors who all were set up in Town Park. There were drawings for gear and free items. Foot massages and care by REI was a big hit. Clothing, hammocks and tents and gear repair all had big crowds. In late afternoon I went to a talk about wild edible plants then enjoyed the live music and food court area before strolling down the Creeper Trail to the One Way Ministries and my pre-arranged ride back to the hotel in Abingdon. 
Learned it is a lot harder to log 10K steps on my Fitbit walking around town, let alone very many of miles. I usually had my 10K steps in two hours on the trail now it took me most of the day.","
",Trail Days,"May 19, Sat",6.75
Gouda Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594446,"I spent the morning at an herbal plant talk and then a very interesting lecture and discussion with Warren Doyle (http://www.warrendoyle.com) titled ""Changes in the AT Trail Over the Years"". He holds the unofficial record for the number of times someone has thru-hiked the AT. Here are a few observations he has made:
1. People who completed a thru-hike of the AT had set themselves that task. If you don't do that you don't finish.
2. We have ""become writing and geographically illiterate"" (sic) because of tech devices.
3. Conversations around the campfires used to be about Thoreau, John Muir and John Denver's music now it is about shuttles, shelters and town trips.
4.  Shelter logs used to have lessons and reflections now there are just short messages to other hikers.
5.  We used to hitchhike now we call shuttles.
6.  We are more fearful, and fear has brought companies profits in gear and gadgets.
He acknowledged that the trail is better maintained but also longer than in the 70's and that cell phones had helped with the loneliness but also was the cause of frivolous rescues.
At 2 pm the hikers, clothed in thrift store costumes, gathered on Douglas Street under signs for the year they hiked the AT. There were four hikers from 2007. The parade started on Douglas street and ended at Town Park. Locals and family members of the hikers parading lined the streets, some with soaker squirt guns and even hoses to spray the hikers. Some of the hikers had a few water pistols of their own to shoot back. Dat Boi was there with his unicycle and frog costume and Knot Yet walked beside me. Wisco found me at one point and gave me an AT necklace he had gotten at Crazy Larry's. He said DJ was on up the trail ahead of him, but he'd catch up. I told him to tell DJ hello and that I would be thinking about them finishing the trail in Oct. and to be sure to post something!
The Parade ended but the vendors continued to sell gear and shout out raffle winners, there was live music, dancing and food into the evening. My experience on the AT and Trail Days was winding down but my enthusiasm to continue North still burned.","Abingdon
