Well, we are 5 weeks from when when we begin. We couldn’t be more excited! We’ve pretty much finished getting our gear and base packs ready (... as soon as Han chooses her starting footwear...). The bulk cliff bars, usb power banks, and spare water filter arrived last week - completing the majority of the gear we were waiting on. We hoped to do another shakedown hike last weekend, but it poured rain and Jeff had a cold. Of course we know we will hike in the rain a whole lot, and probably even with a cold, but seemed silly to do while trying to stay healthy, finishing up work and all that. Jeff’s about to start programming a show on broadway for the next month while Han finishes up working on her TV series. Finalizing plans to move out of the apartment too! It’s all happening!! Enjoy this photo of our beloved kitten who we are soaking up every moment with before she goes to live with her Aunt while we hike.
More soon,
Han and Jeff (and Edith)",,View Entry,"Feb 12, Mon",0
Penguin and Shiver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584019,"We begin our trek just 1 week from tomorrow!!! It still feels a little unreal, to be honest. Between packing up our apartment, getting ready for the trail, and finishing up at work, it has really been a whirlwind of emotions. 
Tonight’s task was to get our first bit of food divided up and ready to pack! We are starting with 4 full days worth. It should be a 3 day hike to Neels Gap for the first resupply, plus a day extra.
We used the standard model of packing about 2000 calories per day, and averaging a weight of about 2 lbs per day. We will perfect this as we go, but gotta start somewhere, right? 
Enclosed photos include all the food all around our living room (probably twice as much as we packed - some of this will go to our bounce box - thanks Mom and Dad...), then a photo of our 2 dry bags that will get packed.
Tomorrow we put the rest of the pack together for the last time before hitting the trail! More entries to come!!",,View Entry,"Mar 12, Mon",0
Penguin and Shiver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584221,"Tonight we put the final touches on our packs!! So exciting (and slightly stressful...)! Han is at just under 30lbs and Jeff is just over 35lbs (4 days of food packed, but no water yet... I mean... do we really need water?? It seems so heavy...).Tomorrow Jeff has his last day of work, while Han and her parents continue boxing up our apartment for the move Saturday. It’s all happening!!! Stay tuned for more updates!",,View Entry,"Mar 15, Thu",0
Penguin and Shiver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584667,"And we are off on our adventure! Just like that. Meant to check in on the first day, but no cell service. Oh well - ultimately it’s been good to get away from our phone screens. 
Had beautiful weather the first day. We had crazy thunderstorms the night before starting, which was slightly unnerving, but it cleared right up for morning (just like what happened for our buddy, Switchback, who successfully thru hiked last year - so we are taking it as a good sign!). We hiked the 8.5 mile approach then did a couple miles on the AT and spent night 1 at the Stove Creek shelter. It was raining on and off so we opted to grab some floor in the second story loft of the shelter instead of fussing with our tent. That night brought temps below freezing.
Those temps hung around for day two so we worked hard to stay warm while beginning this hiking endeavor. We try to embrace whatever Mother Nature has to offer, knowing that we will soon be complaining it’s too hot. Night two was spent, after about a 12.5 mile hike, at a lovely tent sight called Devils Kitchen - a welcomed oasis in a valley after being high on snowy, windy ridge lines most of the day. We were in our tents resting our aching bodies by 7:30pm both nights!
Today we hiked just under 10 miles to Lance Creek Restoration, where lots of folks stop to avoid camping in the next stretch that requires bear canisters (which I’ve never seen someone travel with). Gorgeous and warmer day today! We are loving life. We arrive at Neels Gap tomorrow for a night off the trail and a resupply. 
More soon!","Devils Kitchen

Penguin and Shiver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585099,"We’ve been through a lot since our last entry! We arrived at Neels Gap and hitched a ride into Blairsville, GA, where we stayed at a little family owned motel. We did laundry and ate wings, burgers, fried green tomatoes, and pizza! All in all, a successful first trail town. Hitched back to the trail and restocked supplies at Mountain Crossings. 
We hiked about 9 miles the same day as resupply and stayed at our first unofficial trail side tent site. A little creepy to be camped totally alone, as opposed to with other hikers, but uneventful. That night brought heavy rain - though our tent kept us completely dry! 
The next day brought crazy pea-soup fog. Temps never really breached 40, and visibility never reall breached 100 feet. It was wild how disorienting the trail can be when you can’t really see beyond 100 feet. For all we know, we missed lots of great views! We even had some wintery mixed precipitation over some mountain ridge lines. Eventually we made it to our destination, about 12 miles away. We were both experiencing some lower knee pain at this point, mainly down hill.
Next day, the fog was less, but more of the same otherwise... more cold and windy. We had our first trail magic - a can of beer, left for us on top of Tray Mountain. (We are fairly certain that this older gentleman left it for us, who was operating a HAM radio on various mountain tops and had been talking with us.) That night we were at a more popular tent site and ended up meeting some cool people and having our first camp fire. Wizard taught us about some moss that is “the worlds strongest antibiotic and also the best toilet paper!” (We’ll see...)
This morning we hiked another 6 miles to Top of Georgia Hiker Hostel where we will take our first zero tomorrow to let our knees heal.
We also have settled on trail names for now - we’ll see if they stick. Jeff is going with Penguin - for his love of penguins, the waddle when walking, and penguin duct tape. Hannah is going with Shiver (for obvious reasons...).","Adis Gap
",Top of Georgia Hostel,"Mar 27, Tue",0
Penguin and Shiver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585510,"Our adventure continues. Top of Georgia was a great success. We mailed home about 6 pounds of gear that we were able to rethink / replace. Penguin’s pack was down to 36 lbs fully loaded with four days of food and water, and Shiver’s was down to 32 lbs. We have more ideas to keep cutting back on the weight. 
After TOG, lots of hikers went short distances and hunkered down for a stormy forecast. We decided to keep hiking as long as we could and not to fear the rain - as it was a nice, warmer day, even with sun occasionally. Our choice to push on paid off. We made it about 12 miles to Muskrat Creek Shelter and got all our camp tasks completed before the rain started. It rained a good 2” torrentially overnight. We also met up with a bunch of people that we hadn’t seen since our first days, learning everyone’s new trail names. It’s crazy how on the trail people disappear and reappear as you overlap with each other off and on. That day we also crossed the border from Georgia to North Carolina. (NC immediately welcomed us with climbing what felt like a few steep cliff faces...gee thanks.)
We packed up our muddy, wet tent, along with a lot of damp gear, and hiked up Standing Indian Mountain - our first 5000’+ peak of the trail. It ended up being a surprisingly manageable hike. The skies cleared and it ended up being a beautiful day. We stopped after over 9 miles, at Beech Gap, and aired out all of our gear to dry. That night we met up with some new and old trail friends and hung out around the camp fire, enjoying the weather. Eventually it did drop below freezing, but it’s getting easier to handle as we go along for sure.
It’s amazing how the act of hiking quickly has become a comfortable and welcome routine. We camp, hike, and repeat - and it’s almost therapeutic (in a painful way) after 10 or so days so far.
The following day (Saturday 3/31 for those who are counting), we started off with an easy 9 miles to the Albert Mountain approach. We were welcomed at Mooney Gap with Easter weekend trail magic (a bag with snacks and an egg from the Nantahala Trail Club). We then scaled the extremely steep, rocky climb to the top, where there was an awesome old fire tower!! The weather was perfect - our best yet, so the views were spectacular. Another 2.5 easy miles made our day about 12 miles and we arrived at our tent pad at Long Branch Shelter. Penguin slipped on a muddy slope while hanging the bear bag line. No injuries but landed exactly on his pocket containing his glasses - which promptly snapped into two pieces. A little bit of penguin duct tape and super glue that we borrowed from fellow hiker, Wet Sticks, and they were made functional again - thanks to Shiver’s craftiness. Plans for getting our hands on the back up glasses are in progress.
We are definitely getting quicker and more comfortable with a pace. A day over 10 miles used to fill the day and now we arrive mid afternoon. Still building up our knee strength and in pain occasionally, but improving all the time.
Today we hiked 7 miles to Winding Stair Gap. In honor of April Fools Day, someone told us that the Chinese satellite crashed just off the AT, North of Fontana. We believed it for part of the day! Thanks for that, Boora. We arrived at Winding Stair to waiting trail magic of oranges, Gatorade, and PBR. As we debated about how to get into Franklin, a passerby pulled over and wanted to talk to us about our hiking experiences, as he is planing a thru hike soon. He offered us and another hiker a ride to town if we let him keep picking our brains about our experience. We arrived at the Budget Inn and then walked / got rides all over town resupplying and checking out the local outfitter. Penguin finally caved and purchased a new sleeping bag that is half the weight and compresses to half the size and is warmer than his old one. The old one gets shipped home tomorrow. Shiver also did a few minor gear tweaks. We met up with lots of hiker friends at the only restaurant / bar open in Franklin on Easter Sunday - the Lazy Hiker. It was kind of like an AT Easter / Passover festival gathering. Delivery pizza and relaxing rounds out the night. 
The next weeks bring new, more challenging terrain - and we are excited for it all!","Long Branch Shelter

Penguin and Shiver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585994,"The miles keep rolling on! We left Franklin, NC and then took two nights to get to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC). Those three days were for the most part beautiful weather. We climbed our first bald mountains and explored a couple observation towers on mountain peaks. Bald mountains are odd in the east. We are used to balds out in New Mexico that are caused by being above tree level, but out here they are caused by either humans chopping the trees down long ago, bug outbreaks, fires, or other things of that nature. That day which included hiking over Wayah Bald and Wesser Bald was our longest day until then - at 13.5 miles. We finished the day tired but feeling good. 
That evening we were at Wesser Bald Shelter. A large, powerful thunderstorm swept through during the night. We awoke and trekked the 6 miles down a steep decent into NOC the next morning to find the power had been knocked out due to the storm - a bummer for us since we had reservations there and wanted to do laundry, eat at the restaurant, etc. We did manage to sneak in hot showers while there was still hot water left at least! Eventually the power came back, but it was too late for the restaurant to open. A kind individual offered to shuttle some hikers into town to resupply and get food - so a massive pizza takeout order was placed, which saved the day. We sat and waited for the pizza while drinking beers from the NOC general store down by the Nantahala River - not too shabby. We also hung out all of our gear to dry after last night’s storm. All in all - a successful stop.
The next morning, as we were hopping back on trail, a kind person popped out of his cabin and handed us a plate of fresh baked pastries - an awesome start to the day. Every hiker loves second breakfast (or food at anytime really). We scaled the mountain side out of NOC, about 3300’ additional up to Cheoah Bald, and camped for the night shortly after at Locust Gap. That evening we made the decision that we would push for our longest day yet the next morning - 17 miles - and get to Fontana a day early so we could rest and take a zero day today (Saturday 4/7) while we let some less desirable weather pass. We successfully made that goal yesterday and are in Fontana now! It was an exhausting day, but overall we are happy with how we handled it (mentally and physically)!
We are enjoying a day off today - filled with laundry, resupply, eating, beers, and chatting with lots of other hikers doing the same stuff. We are super excited to get back out there and start the Great Smokies National Park (GSNP) tomorrow! GSNP will be a big landmark accomplishment for us. People say the trail flattens out after that - but we’ve also been told never ever to believe someone when they say that the trail levels out... so we’ll see!","
",Fontana Village,"Apr 07, Sat",0
Penguin and Shiver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586918,"Wow - what a week (ish) it has been since Fontana! Great Smokies National Park (GSNP) was full of ups and downs (literally and figuratively). We left the lodge in Fontana on the first trail shuttle available the morning of 4/8, then immediately walked along the AT across Fontana Dam, which was extremely cool. It’s enormous. We made lots of dam jokes, took lots of dam pictures, and did some dam hiking across it. (You get the idea.)
We then hiked into GSNP - up, up, and up, back into the mountains. That day brought an awesome climb up to an old fire tower on Shuckstack Mountain, which we can’t believe we were actually allowed to scale. It was a little worse for the wear, let’s just say. We continued to make the day’s mileage total around 13 and stayed inside Mollie’s Ridge Shelter. GSNP has specific rules about staying in shelters instead of setting up tents, if possible, to minimize environmental impact, so we stayed in shelters more often in the park. It’s always a bonus to keep the tent dry. 
The next day (4/9) brought rain, mud, mud, and dense fog. Also there was a lot of mud. We passed lots of views that looked like white sheets 20 feet in front of us. That day we learned that it’s much harder to walk 13 miles in mud than a long distance in more normal conditions. Many hikers agreed that this was the hardest day yet. We tried to prepare ourselves for the real possibility that the rest of the park would be like that. Camped at Derek’s Knob Shelter.
To our delight - the following day (4/10), we awoke to a crisp, clear day. It was still cold, which at this point was getting old (we were slowly forgetting what it felt like for our hands and toes not to be numb every morning during camp chores), but we were thrilled for sunshine and visibility, especially since this was the day we were to go over Clingmans Dome, the highest point on the AT. And also as a bonus, the mud subsided! We hiked what felt like an easy 14 ish miles, even though we went up an enormous mountain, because compared to mud - everything seemed easy. At Clingmans, we were treated to a bag of fresh grapes as trail magic! After that, we passed the 200 mile mark. We stayed at Mt Collins Shelter and got a fire going in the fireplace, after a struggle with the wet, frozen wood.
On 4/11, we hiked a quick 5 miles, featuring trail magic of breakfast pastries and other snacks, to Newfound Gap. We then hitched into Gatlinburg (in a car of three lovely retired gentlemen on a vacation with their wives) for the evening. Wow - what a crazy tourist trap that town is! We had a big meal, did laundry, and resupplied.
On 4/12 we hitched back into the park (this time with a super cool father son duo from Michigan), with a plan to do 5 nights to get to the next town - Hot Springs, NC. The weather and views just got better and better. We stayed at Pecks Corner Shelter and met a new group of hikers we hadn’t yet seen. It is wild how that keeps happening as everyone’s paces change. There are so many hikers out here!! We were very happy to have warmer temps, finally.
The next day (4/13) we set out to do a 13 mile day, but it was so nice out and the terrain was so moderate that we achieved that goal by 2pm. Decision time - the next shelter was another 7 miles further, plus there was a mile side trip to another fire lookout we wanted to see. We opted to push on, and we even made it to that fire lookout on Mount Cammerer! Just like that; we achieved our first 20+ mile day. We were exhausted, but all in all felt pretty great! That night we stayed in Davenport Gap Shelter - the last one in GSNP. It’s also the only shelter on the trail that has a chain link fence over the front, that you lock yourself in at night, and you keep the food in the shelter instead of hanging it outside. Kind of an ironic feeling to lock yourself in a cage to keep the wildlife out (especially since it was Friday the 13th). We were reminded of that scene from the Blue Brothers where they are playing in that bar with the stage behind a chain link fence. I half expected a bear to just be waiting for us to come out in the morning. Other than a bat flying around the shelter at one point - it was ultimately uneventful. 
Some people in this new group that we ended up hiking on pace with had a plan to get to Hot Springs before a cold front came in, but it would mean doing only one night on trail after GSNP, and two 18+ mile days of hiking back to back. With Shiver’s hatred of cold, we decided to give it a try too! We knew it would be a big push, but we needed to show ourselves we are capable of it. It was time to really see what we could do. 
On 4/14 we left Davenport Gap Shelter, emerging from our cage. We hiked the few miles out of GSNP, and were again greeted by trail magic of snacks and sodas, fruit, and juice! This was a Saturday, which is the most likely day to receive trail magic since people are off work, etc. We lucked out that we happen to be hitting some big road crossings on a Saturday in good weather for this reason. We hiked under Interstate 40, then stopped at the famous hostel, Standing Bear Farm, for a quick resupply. The day became very hot and sunny, as we climbed the 5 miles of steel up hill to the peak of Snowbird Mountain. There was this cool looking FAA flight radar system up there, which was pretty fun to see. Lunch at Groundhog Creek Shelter, 11 miles into the day, then onwards and upwards for 7 more miles. We crossed through the famous Max Patch, a beautiful, expansive mountain top meadow, late in the day, then it was a quick trip downhill to Roaring Fork Shelter. 18 miles down - boom! Again - exhausted but feeling good!!
Woke up to rain on 4/15, but mild temps still. After the hot heat and sun while maintain climbing yesterday - this actually wasn’t terrible. Penguin had the realization that his warm weather hiking attire is essentially swimming clothes - a rash guard t-shirt (what surfers wear on top when it’s warm in the ocean - purchased on our honeymoon in Hawaii), and swim trunks as shorts. So when it rains and it’s not freezing, Penguin is more than happy to just get wet rather than sweating inside of rain gear. It’s like going for a swim! We pushed over two more mountain peaks, then hiked the 11 or so miles downhill into Hot Springs - crushing another 18+ mile day! 
We opted to treat ourselves to another zero today, since we arrived here 2 nights ahead of our original schedule. We are staying in a cool little room above a tavern! 
While it’s amazing that we proved to ourselves we can handle those big days, which will become more common, we do need to let our muscles heal a little. It was a big jump from what we were doing. They say when you get your “trail legs,” this suddenly gets easier and easier, and the miles start flying by. We are definitely on the brink of that!!","

Guess what: the trail didn’t flatten out. It must never flatten out. And just when it gets warm, it drops below freezing again. Never a dull moment!
We left Hot Springs on 4/17 in nice weather, with our plan to go about 15 miles per day. The first day, we went an uneventful 16 or so miles and camped trail side. That day we saw some beautiful meadows and were treated to trail magic, in the form of a box of soda, fruit, and beer, left next to a road crossing. 
4/18 was a hot day, but had some breath taking ridge lines we traversed midday. On hot days (the very few thus far), we’ve been taking longer lunches while we filter an extra batch of water and rest in the shade, letting the heat of the day pass a bit. This was one of those days. After lunch we crossed over a mountain top called Big Butt. Then we went another 6 miles, passing some old grave sites from the civil war. The day ended at around 17 miles at Flint Mountain Shelter. At the shelter we found yet another almost entirely new group of people. It seems in our pushing farther faster, we had found a bubble that started earlier and was moving slower. Of course, with our changing pace - this would keep happening. That night brought temps back into the 30s.
The next morning on 4/19, we got up a little early (6:30 instead of 7/7:30) and planned to hike our longest day yet. This would essentially get us half a day ahead and allow us to take a full day instead of a nero (near zero mile day) into the next town. The weather called for slightly cooler temps and no rain, so better for hiking than hot and / or rainy days. So we hiked on! The day ended up being cooler and windier than ideal - but is it ever ideal? We crossed under interstate 26, and hiked 15 miles before stopping for lunch! Our morning miles come easier than afternoon, so we tend to push harder before we stop for lunch. (We consider “morning” to be anytime before lunch even though that’s often 2pm or later.) After lunch, we climbed Big Bald. Aren’t the names just so creative sometimes? It’s a big, bald topped mountain - shockingly. It was quite windy on top, but beautiful. Four more miles after that ended our 22.5 miles day at Whistling Gap, where we met up with hiker friends that we were sure were days ahead of us. That night was again to bring temps in the 20s, so we were glad they had started a campfire! It felt good to know that we could pound out those miles, but darn were we sore.
Sometimes when it’s freezing in the morning - it’s so frustrating that every camp task makes your hands go numb. We’ve mentioned this before. So this morning (4/20 - our trail 1 month anniversary!), Penguin started a fire easily with the coals from the night before. All the hikers gathered around to stay warm and allow themselves the few minute sacrifice of hiking time to have that small luxury. Always worth it! We hiked the “short” 13 miles into Erwin, TN, where we hitched a ride to a motel for the night. We resupplied and did all the usual town chores. Sometimes it’s the hikes into towns that feel the longest. It’s very hard to break the “are we there yet” mentality. The approach to Erwin went on forever - up, down, up, down, again and again, switch back after switch back. We got there eventually!
4/21 was a beautiful day - and we were happy to hit the trail and get back up into the mountains. Lots of sunshine! We came across some trial magic of snack food and cold sodas. On top of a mountain called Beauty Spot, there was a wedding happening! Two thru hikers who met on trail a couple years ago were getting married and had invited any hikers in the area! The aisle of the ceremony was the AT. They had a small catered meal and free beer for any hikers who wanted! It was a little hiker party on a beautiful mountain top - what a perfect experience. Another few miles brought us to Unaka Mountain where we camped.
Similar weather on 4/22. We hiked the relatively uneventful hike to Clyde Smith Shelter. We opted to sleep in the shelter, hearing of rain and high winds in the forecast for the night. Penguin made a campfire - again a sure fire (get it?) way to encourage hiker community.
4/23 was to bring us up over 6000 feet again, up Roan Mountain and a few bald tops after it. With the forecast to remain wet, cold, and windy - this was quite the experience. We constantly were passing freshly fallen trees over the trail, in the howling wind, as we made our first climb. Sadly we have very few photos, because stopping to take a picture isn’t really the first thought in these conditions. Visibility was near zero. Dodging the falling trees, cold, and soaked, we made it the first 8.5 miles of the day to the highest shelter on the AT, where we had lunch and took a breath. Conditions were so bad, we considered staying here for the night. To say Shiver was cold would be a dramatic understatement. We opted to add a few layers, drink a cup of hot water, and push on. To stay there would just mean wasting energy and food trying to keep warm when we could instead get lower and further along where conditions may improve. Back into the cold wet wind and fog we went. By fog, we mean, clouds flying past you right in front of your face. Fog sounds too static. This was always moving. We trekked 1.5 miles down hill through what we now call the Appalachian Stream, where we reached the visitor center at Carver Gap (a trailhead and a bathroom). We hunkered down in the little bathroom for a few minutes to again regroup and give each other a pep talk for what we had to do next - two straight miles up and down three short, but high and 100% exposed bald peaks. This is where we really entered a new universe. The wind and rain was so intense, we had to yell to communicate, as we kept getting blown a few steps off the trail and would have to brace then return again. The stream of the trail had become a small river. We’ve heard these are some great views - but would never know that day. The rain felt like being blasted with a power washer. Any waterproof clothing is no match here - we were soaked. Penguins pack cover blew right off. Somehow we caught it, but that meant even a more soaked pack. Of course with his scout training, everything inside was also waterproofed, so not the end of the world. Somehow, we got over those miles of exposure and made it the rest of our 15 miles to the famous Overmountain Shelter. This was an old barn that was actually used to house soldiers en route to a Revolutionary War battle once upon a time. Google it for more info. We were too cold and wet to read the plaque. We found lots of other hikers in the barn, already in sleeping bags, trying to stay warm, surrounded by clothes dripping on make shift clothes lines. We joined in. That night, the wind and rain continued and the barn swayed and shook in the wind, like an old wooden roller coaster. We proved this day that we can do anything on this trail, at least more than we could’ve imagined, for a few miles at least.
Today, on 4/24, the weather had not changed that much. The other hikers and us all begrudgingly got back into our wet clothes - because why get the one dry thing we had wet immediately. We climbed a couple balds first thing that morning in conditions similar to yesterday, but far less scary, knowing we’ve done it before. We had previously planned a resupply in Roan, so we hiked the 10 miles there. We opted to stay in a hostel and let the weather pass. Tomorrow is supposed to be slightly better, and the trail stays at a lower elevation for a long time now. The hostel accidentally overbooked, we we are in a much nicer room than we paid for, drying out and warming up!  Here’s to hoping conditions improve.","Overmountain Shelter

On 4/25 we departed the hostel in Roan. The weather was cloudy and misty, with minimal wind. Turns out that this seems like a tropical vacation, compared to what it was like in previous days! The terrain also became relatively mellow, so we polished off an easy 18 or so miles. Shiver has a new foot issue it seems - something to do with overuse on the ball of the feet. Turns out the human body takes some adjusting to hiking full time. Who would’ve thought. We setup camp at Mooreland Gap Shelter, as the rain picked up. 
The next morning, 4/26, we awoke to surprisingly clearer skies! The forecast was for more rain, so we were cautious still... We hiked out of the mountains down to the Laurel Fork River, a delightfully pleasant and scenic walk along fast water and falls. Certain types of trail conditions “don’t count,” (meaning the miles just pass without thinking or noticing). Walking along water in nice weather does not count. Walking along roads or in towns does not count either. So we enjoyed these bonus miles! A quick 6 miles up and down Pond Mountain brought us to Boots Off Hostel and Campground, as heavy rain resumed. We opted to pay a few bucks and camp here, with the use of showers, flush toilet, and a place to sit sheltered from the rain. And bonus - it came with a free shuttle to nearby stores where we treated ourselves to McDonalds for dinner! We sat with other hikers staying there and enjoyed being social for the evening, before retiring back to our tent in the rain.
4/27 brought drier conditions, but still clouds. We walked along the slightly swollen Watauga Lake, viewing another beautiful dam, before climbing back up into the mountains. After this initial climb, the terrain seemed to really mellow out, with only a few hundred feet up and down once in a while. The sun also finally returned! We were enjoying the weather and terrain so much that we opted to hike 20 miles instead of 16. We set up camp on the trail side. Funny how when it’s not raining, setting up camp and the routine of hiking is actually easy and somewhat enjoyable! We forget sometimes. This extra long day put us within another long day’s reach of Damascus, VA.
On 4/28 we decided to go for it and make the day a 1% into town (about 1% of the whole trail in a day - 22ish miles). The weather was perfect and the terrain remained tame. We hiked through beautiful pastures, and passed an old AT shelter that is no longer used but was preserved for historic reasons - the McQueen Knob Shelter. Lunch at 12 miles in, then another 10-11 downhill into town. We did it - our first back to back 20s. 
We allowed ourself a zero today, 4/29, having made time coming this way and to celebrate reaching VA. Been busy running around doing usual town errands, but ultimately enjoying a restful day before we push off towards Marion, VA tomorrow. Also, the Cavs just won game 7 against the Pacers, so we even more excited about our choice to stay in town tonight!","

Penguin and Shiver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589057,"Marion, VA - Mile 534
The morning of 4/30, we took our last shower until the end of the week, had a delightful breakfast at Mojo’s, then departed Damascus. It seemed we had sort of slipped in between busy hiker bubbles - lots of folks departed the day before and not many more had arrived. We were ok with the prospect of less competition and more space in shelters, etc. The weather was delightful! We hiked a most enjoyable day, up and down a couple mountains, partially following along the Virginia Creeper Trail - a long distance bike trail through VA that also uses Damascus as a trail town. This was also Penguin’s first day in new shorts that actually fit! With his starting pair already a little large plus losing 15-20 pound, this was a more than needed change. We stayed in Lost Mountain Shelter, where there was only a single other person - Thor. We arrived there with plenty of daylight and passed some time trying to help Thor free his bear rope that was snagged in a tree - which included climbing on top of the shelter and lashing lots of long sticks together to make an enormous grabber. After about two hours of entertainment, he successfully freed his caught rope and carribeaner! We also enjoyed sitting around a campfire. Three of us slept in the shelter that was built to sleep closer to 10-12 people. We could’ve set up our tents in the shelter, a luxury I’ve heard of for late in the trail when hikers are even more spaced out, used to combat bugs while staying dry.
We woke up on 5/1 to the sun hitting us right in the face, the way the shelter and the mountains across the valley were oriented. What a welcome occurrence! That morning was our initial climb up to Mount Rogers and the Grayson Highlands. The day was filled with beautiful meadows and sunshine. That afternoon we had our first wild pony sightings. Grayson is known for this. (The ponies were introduced in order to help maintain invasive species growing in the region.) We saw few of them, including a family with little baby ponies! Of course, other hikers scared them off before we could get close. That afternoon we also crossed the 500 mile mark! We hiked 18 miles to Wise Shelter and camped nearby. Once again, it was just us and Thor. We really did slip between hiker bubbles.
On Wednesday 5/2, we continued to follow the very zig zag route of the trail in that region, back over Grayson Highlands, then eventually down away from that area. First thing in the morning we immediately came across more ponies that let us approach them and say hello. We later ran into a nice older gentleman (ironically named Evil) who was out working as a volunteer clearing some blow downs off the trail with hand tools. He also had his truck parked at a road crossing with trail magic in the back - fresh fruit, candy, cold sodas, a couple camp chairs to sit in, and a set of crutches (a joke?). He also handed us a couple of those tiny liquor bottles; so we took some sodas and planned to make cocktails at camp later. The weather stayed nice and the day was relatively uneventful. We camped trailside after a 16 mile day.  At camp, we plopped the soda cans and liquor bottles right into the adjacent stream to cool down, and had a little cocktail with dinner - after all, calories are calories!
Thursday 5/3 was a planned shorter day - 14 miles. We planned to arrive at Partnership Shelter, just outside of Marion, where the following day, we were to rent a car and go to a friend’s wedding in Nashville. It’s astonishing how 14 miles indeed felt short - as not too long ago, we wouldn’t be able to go that far in a full day. That day we passed a pasture with lots of cows, surrounding the trail. There were literally black cows with white spots sitting along trail side - as if they were hired to guide us with white blazes. The day brought warm temps and moderate terrain. We arrived at Partnership early afternoon. This shelter is unique in that it has a working sink and shower - but only with very cold water. The cold shower did feel nice after a hot day of hiking! What a luxury to have running water to fill your water bottle with cool fresh water whenever you want, without looking for a spring or stream to filter from. We sat with trail friends around a perfect campfire, until after 10p - very late for hiker time. We knew that we likely wouldn’t see many people we know, as getting off trail would set us upon a new schedule with those who started after us.Don’t forget to check out our photos in our journal too!

Penguin and Shiver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590438,"Pearisburg, VA - Mile 636On the morning of Wednesday 5/9, we woke up at Partnership Shelter again. Seemed like an easy choice to stay there the evening we got back into Marion for an easy morning back on trail. The weather was beautiful! It was comforting to be back to hiking, but sad to say bye to our family, friends, and modern day conveniences again. The feeling of bittersweet wore off after half a day hiking and it was like riding a bike - well mostly. We definitely felt it in our muscles that we had some time off. Our trail legs weren’t gone - but they needed some time to get back up to speed. That morning we passed the Settlers Museum, which has an old one room school house right at the trail side that is open for hikers to explore. Equally importantly - a local church stocks the schoolhouse with all kinds of hiker magic - cold sodas, Gatorade, toiletries, snacks, pretty much anything you could need. Penguin’s toothbrush snapped in half the night before, so it was very convenient that they had those nifty travel toothbrushes with the built in covers! We hiked a few miles from there to The Barn, a restaurant along side interstate 81, friendly to hikers. Ok so we took the day to ease back into the hiking world and had a restaurant lunch - we still hiked 18.5 miles before the day was done. We camped at the Crawfish Trail, past the AT quarter way sign! Most of the folks we met the night before were here too - a new bubble we plopped right into.
The next morning, 5/10, brought sunshine and another warm day. We hiked through various cow pastures, which is always nice - something different. The day brought more challenging elevation than we had experienced in quite some time - but nothing we couldn’t handle. There were multiple 1+ mile steep climbs, then the day ended with a 5 mile climb to Chestnut Knob Shelter. The afternoon brought thunder showers, which were quite refreshing. The shelter was an old fire warden’s cabin that had been converted to an AT shelter! It also overlooked a massive limestone sink hole - which now looks like a crater and has been settled as a small, isolated town! We got the last couple spots in the cabin, to avoid the rain forecast for the night.
It rained overnight, so the shelter was the right choice. We woke up on 5/11 with the whole mountaintop engulfed in fog, but it was intermittent, as the wind moved clouds around. We made an easy trip of the mainly downhill morning. Midday we hit a road crossing where a kind soul was grilling burgers for trail magic - our favorite! Technically he was frying them in lard on a camp stove - delicious. We stopped to eat lunch and filter water shortly after at the 11 mile mark (yes, lunch after a burger). It was at this point that we realized we were another 11 miles from Brushy Mountain Outpost - a little trail side store that is known for burgers and milk shakes. The only issue was that it closes at 6p, which would mean in order to make it in time, we needed to move fast. We decided to go for it. We made it there by 5:15 - proving that when there is a promise of burgers and shakes, we can move very quickly over 22 miles! That afternoon we also passed through a section of trail that was closed just a week before because of a forest fire. It was pretty crazy to hike through the recent burn scar. The fire was caused by a tree falling on power lines. Our new group of hiking friend were also at the burger place. The owner also offered us the option to camp in the back yard if we got breakfast the next morning - a no-brainer! 
The morning of 5/12 we packed up the tent and piled into the shop for a delicious homemade breakfast - with amazing biscuits and gravy. The morning started with a road walk to get over interstate 77, then was an uneventful walk through the woods. We encountered trail magic again - at a parking area exactly at mile 600! One kind mother of a fellow hiker, visiting for Mother’s Day, made PB&J sandwiches, with chips, cookies, and soft drinks. And another visiting mom brought a cooler of beer. They also had lots of gallon jugs of water for us to refill with, and trash bags for us to dump our trash. A perfect break on that hot day. We finished the 19 mile day at a shop called Trent’s Groceries, where hikers can set up a tent and get a shower for cheap. We bought hot dogs and cooked them over a camp fire, feasting with fellow hikers.
After staying up way too late (after 10pm!), we woke up on 5/13 and made our way to Dismal Falls, for a mid morning swim. Really, it was more of an ice bath, which felt amazing - especially on our feet! The day included a nice flat morning, then what felt like climbing straight up in the mid afternoon heat. A trail friend, Spot, had his wife visiting him and the two of them were set up at a parking area with fresh fruit and cold drinks - third trail magic day in a row! We ended the day after 18 miles at Doc’s Knob Shelter. This shelter has a recently installed wooden deck attached to the front of it that is perfect for cowboy camping, so we all set up and slept out under the stars. The evening was dry and clear - perfect for it. 
This morning (5/14) we made the easy 10 mile trek into Pearisburg before noon, and we are now resupplying, resting, and doing laundry at the lovely Angel’s Rest hostel. Most of the gang we have been hiking with (and some old friends from before our time off) all stopped here too. We are about to go enjoy a feast at the local Mexican restaurant!","

Penguin and Shiver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590917,"Catawba, VA - Mile 703We woke up 5/15 at Angels Rest and cooked a quick breakfast of eggs, toast, sausage, and coffee that we grabbed from Food Lion the night before. We caught the shuttle back to the trail and we were right back at it! The morning began with a lovely 8 mile climb, but it was only steep at times and had some brief downhills sprinkled in, so wasn’t too bad. And of course - miles early on in the day don’t feel as hard (they just make you more exhausted later on). That morning we passed the first remnants of the controversial Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP) construction - a pipeline being built largely along a portion of the AT in Virginia. Protests have been going on for a long time already, and a ranger was stationed at the construction site entrance for this reason. That morning we passed another large black snake, making its way across the trail. We patiently let it pass. We also passed a swarm of bees, high in a tree above the trail! Our only clue to look up at it was the loud buzzing. And finally - we had our first bear sighting! A medium sized black bear was in the woods on the side of the trail ahead of us. It clearly heard us and quickly, but casually, made its way over a ridge and out of sight. Still very cool - and about as close as we feel like we need to come to a bear. That night, after a 19.5 mile day, we stayed on Pine Swamp Branch Shelter, with some friends we had been with for the past week, and a few new friends. Technically that shelter and the surrounding area has been closed to overnight use since last year due to a bug infestation causing trees around it to be at risk of falling, so if anyone asks, we just stopped for a lunch nap very late in the day. The log made it clear that it is still used as routinely as most other shelters. It looks like almost all of the problem trees were cut down and cleaned up already. 
The morning of 5/16 had the humidity of a steam bath - then the rain came. We climbed a couple mountains; mostly in heavy rain. Hiking in the rain is such a funny thing, because you immediately are frustrated - your feet are soaked, everything is soaked, the trail is puddled, muddy, and slippery. Then you have to deal with wet gear and possibly wearing the wet clothes for more days. But really - it’s just rain. It’s going to rain. In fact, it needs to rain. So we try and keep our spirits up and know it will always pass, eventually. Today we also had a realization - Penguin pointed out that quite often, the thought of going over a rough mountain is significantly more challenging and daunting then just climbing the darn thing. Usually you get up and over and it’s surprising how it wasn’t too bad. Shiver agreed and pointed out how that is a perfect metaphor for lots of things in life. Anyway, it was a wet, but otherwise uneventful day. We camped at Laurel Creek Shelter after hiking 18.5 miles. 
5/17 we woke up to the sound of rain again. It is so hard to motivate in the morning when you are just listening to that rain. We eventually got up, took all our wet gear off the clothesline (which we ran across the inside of our tent... it’s fun to sleep under your own wet smelly clothes), and got hiking. Thankfully, the rain held off most of the day and we actually had some nice views, despite the thick humidity. The usual - up and down a couple ridges. Of course just a mile from camp, the end of a 22.5 mile day, the skies opened up in a grandiose way, and before we could get a tent set up, everything was soaked again, negating the days drying progress. We set up the tent as fast as we could, but it still got soaked inside and out. Shiver toweled off the inside of the tent and worked on the frustrating task of making our home away from home onto some level of normal despite everything being wet, while Penguin worked on filtering water and hanging the bear bag. Another night sleeping under the clothesline. It poured all night. Our tent held up well - a few drips here and there, and wet walls, but as good as any tent does in non stop torrential rain.
We got up this morning and worked again on the newly familiar task of breaking down camp in rain. We hiked over Dragons Tooth, passed the 700 mile mark, and made our way down some very wet, steep, rocks. Shiver is a pro at this - Penguin takes some time. We passed lots of view points with zero visibility, which is always fun. We are adding this to our list of sections to come back to when it’s nice. Sadly the forecast is rain for a long time, and tomorrow we get to McAfee Knob. We hiked 6.5 miles to Four Pines Hostel in Catawba for a brief day to let everything dry out. The wet feet and boots destroy your feet, so it’s important to take the time to rest.","Pickle Branch Shelter

Penguin and Shiver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591429,"Buchanan, VA - Mile 751We woke up early on the morning of 5/19 to the sounds of a staff member at the hostel yelling loudly at a hiker who was supposedly trying to get out of paying for a shuttle. So with that lovely start to the day, we hiked on! There was a window of dry weather that morning, according to the forecast, so we tried to make good time. We ended up hiking with a group from our new trail family (tramily). There’s a funny phenomenon when you hike with groups - you kind of assume you are the one slowing the team down, if you’re in front at least. This motivates you to move faster than normal. This particular morning, Penguin was leading the group, and to quote our trail friend, Bud, he was “hauling ass.” It almost feels like you’re being chased when in front. We made quick work of the six miles to the McAfee Knob parking area where Saucy Feet’s mother was parked in a camper, making grilled cheese, coffee, and lemonade, for passing hikers. Trail magic! We should also mention that the first few miles of the day took us through cow pastures that were 100% saturated with water, so our feet were immediately soup, despite the break in the rain. Ultimately, most of the trail was still a raging river or wet mud. We hiked up to McAfee Knob and took our cliche photos, with no view to be had, then hiked on. The initial plan was to stay at a shelter 17 miles in on that day, but we were making great time and the next town, Daleville, was only an extra 9+ miles, so our whole tramily decided to push, making the day 26 miles! Our first marathon! Some folks hike 30 miles regularly on trail, but this was an accomplishment for us. Meanwhile, Penguin had been coordinating with Shiver’s sister, Alice, who wanted to surprise Shiver on trail and was going to do so as we approached Daleville - which meant Penguin had to discreetly notify her that we were going to be there a day earlier. Somehow she still pulled it off - during our final miles into town, she popped up in front of Shiver, running south bound (toward us). It was a perfect surprise. She took our minds off the exhaustion and soreness of waking those last few miles. She brought us all kinds of gifts too - random stuff hikers need, toiletries, some snacks from home, and stuff like that. Alice joined us for dinner and stayed with us at the motel for that night.
5/20 was a zero day in Daleville. Alice drove us, and some trail friends, to Gander Mountain to grab a few things. We got lunch at a bbq place in town, did our resupply, reapplied a layer of waterproofing to our tent, did laundry; and most importantly - aired out all the damp gear. A successful day off. Alice went back home that afternoon. 
On 5/21, we left our motel and hiked up toward the famous Blue Ride Parkway. That morning we passed the one third point - getting closer! The weather was nice and the trail was dry enough that our feet didn’t get soaked. What a relief! We hiked the relatively uneventful hike to Bobblets Gap Shelter. We got spots in the shelter and got all the camp chores done before the rain started. Again - what a relief, compared to last week. We slept well, dry and out of the rain, with our tent packed away, also staying dry. 
This morning we got up early, as tends to happen in shelters since when one person is up, the noise of them packing gets everyone up. It’s not a bad thing - early starts should be the norm. Shiver experienced an increase in pain in we Achilles’ tendon this morning that she’s been dealing with for a lot of the trip; but it has become clear we need to take some time off and reevaluate our mileage - maybe tone it down a bit after a few days of rest. We have been pushing harder than expected. So we are doing our best to keep moral up, as we wait in Buchanan, VA for our savior, Alice, to come pick us up. We will stay at her place for the rest of the week probably. Don’t worry - we will be back and stronger than ever!","Bobblets Gap Shelter

Penguin and Shiver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592810,"Rockfish Gap - Mile 863We are back on trail! Our days of rest in Winchester were extremely useful. Shiver consulted with a sports podiatrist and had an appointment with a physical therapist who specializes in treating athletes who are not stopping what they are doing (like an active thru hiker). We had a new plan of attack - to keep our mileage down for a bit. Shiver is working on a new technique for hiking, which seems to be helping to ease the stress on her Achilles’ tendon so far, but is like learning how to hike again, retraining muscles and enforcing new muscle memory, etc. 
On Saturday (5/26) Alice drove us back to the trail where we had hopped off. She even hiked a mile with us to say goodbye! We hiked 10 miles to Bryant Ridge Shelter. We were welcomed back on trail by a lovely afternoon thunderstorm. Though we were lucky enough to come across some trail magic - snacks, beers, sodas, the works! The shelter had a bunch of weekenders out for the holiday, but they were staying in tents. There were also a few other through hikers staying there - mainly new people for us. 
Sunday 5/27 involved a significant uphill climb for much of the day, so we again planned to do 10 miles. We met another hiker (Marmot) on this morning who also works in the tv/film industry, so her and Shiver bonded over this. It’s a small world! We hiked over Apple Orchard Mountain where there was this awesome FAA weather radar station. We arrived at Thunder Ridge Shelter just as the rain (and thunder, coincidentally) picked up. The storm subsided. Penguin, out of boredom mainly, made a campfire. These shorter days prove to be a lesson in passing time, when we finish hiking early but still stop to let our bodies recover. That night, it rained heavily. We were very glad to be in the shelter.
We made the choice on 5/28, Memorial Day, to go into Glasgow for a resupply and spend the night at a hostel. It would be our longest day back, but was largely down hill and would be good to remind us that we can in fact go more than 10 miles in a day. We made it the 15 miles by 2:30p, then caught a ride into town. We were greeted at the trailhead by trail magic of cold sodas! In town we resupplied and spend the afternoon resting.
On the AT, what goes down, eventually goes back up. On 5/29, we got a ride back to the trail and spent most of the day climbing back up to around 4000 feet. The humidity has been crazy these past few days. The air is completely wet and sticky. This day was no exception. We hiked a rather uneventful 11 miles to Punchbowl Shelter. We passed time by sweeping out the shelter, picking up litter, and improving the spring (Penguin dug a deep pool so you could more easily collect water at the stream). The shelter had a lovely family of birds living in it, compete with a nest containing four chicks. The mother bird was constantly bringing bugs to feed the children, that we watched we her and the father catch. It was like watching TV. Again, it rained heavily into the evening.
We awoke 5/30 to continuing rain. We tried to take our time to let it stop before hiking on, but eventually we headed out into it. The shelter was also engulfed in fog. We hiked down from the mountain, eventually escaping the rain and fog. Rain did continue throughout the day intermittently heavy at times; and when it was not raining, the humidity felt like it was. We passed the 800 mile marker, and walked along the steep shores of a reservoir, before climbing a very steep, long ascent back into the mountains (into the rain and fog again), up to Bald Knob. Ironically, it was not a bald peak - maybe you could say it was balding, but hardly. We stayed in Cow Camp Shelter after a 16 mile day, easily our most challenging day in a while, because of the rain and that afternoon climb. This rain and humidity has not been quite as taxing as in weeks past though, mainly because it hasn’t been prolonged enough to wash out the trail and make our feet soaked. Once your feet get water logged, it’s a new level of unpleasant. We are staying positive and keeping faith that it will eventually be nice out again!
On 5/31 when we awoke, it wasn’t raining! But don’t worry - after walking a mile or so through rain-coated vegetation, our feet were pretty much soaked. Such is life! This day was more or less uneventful. A rare nicety was that the weather cooperated - we stopped at a shelter for lunch, and immediately it started pouring. The rain stopped, then we continued. We heard thunder and the skies grew dark, just as we arrived at camp. Then once we were safe in shelter, the rain came! Sometimes it works out like that. We hiked 17 miles and stayed at The Priest Shelter - on The Priest Mountain. This shelter has a notorious log book, where hikers confess their hiker sins. (For example, one read: “Forgive me Heavenly Father, for I have sinned. Every time I pee in the woods, I get a tiny bit of pee on my shorts.” There were lots of confessions like that - many that we wouldn’t repeat here. That night, the mosquitos were aggressive. Penguin was reminded of his days with the scouts in Canada. We wondered if our days camping in shelters are ending. 
To our delight, the sun woke us up on 6/1! This was going to be a big day - down from The Priest, the up and over Three Ridges - about 4000’ down then straight back up all in about 10 miles. The weather held out and we accomplished the daunting task. We hiked 15.5 miles to Reed Gap. From Reed Gap, we hitched a ride to Devils Backbone Brewpub where hikers can spend the night camping and enjoy the restaurant, plus a cheap hiker breakfast. We had a great time hanging with new friends and resting.
The next morning, Saturday 6/2, after hiker breakfast, we were back to hiking! We initially had been planing to meet up with Penguin’s cousin, Jay when we got to Waynesboro. Jay lives with his girlfriend Hanh in Richmond, about 90 minutes from the trail. However - they had a baby last Sunday, so we figured they were way too busy and occupied to deal with us. But somehow out of the kindness and generosity of their hearts - Penguin got a text from them asking where and when they would be picking us up! So we hiked all day - 19.5 miles in torrential rain and thunderstorms. We had to ford our first river - swollen with rain water. Boots off, crocks on, and you walk right across the rushing water. It’s the kind of weather that makes you not want to ever stop hiking. It’s just too miserable to stay in one place. What are you gonna do, sit and get soaked? No - you just hike on. The amount of discomfort we have learned to get used to is astonishing actually. Not too long ago, we may have been upset to walk all day getting soaked, but it’s just part of the deal these days. Anyway, we arrived at Rockfish Gap, just before the entry to Shenandoah National Park, and Cousin Jay was there! To take in two rain soaked hikers who have been hiking for most of a week without a shower is no small task, let alone to sit in a car with them for 90 minutes. We had a joyous reunion nonetheless, made it to Richmond, showered, laundered, and became humans again. Their new baby is absolutely adorable. We are honored to be the first family to meet him. 
We are hanging with Jay, Hanh, and baby Zachary today, taking a zero. Then tomorrow we enter Shenandoah!","Reeds Gap

Penguin and Shiver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593490,"North Shenandoah NP - Mile 952On the morning of 6/4, we got a ride back into the mountains from Richmond. There was a lot of fog on the drive, but sure enough as we got up to the AT, we appeared above the clouds in perfect weather. We hiked a beautiful and enjoyable 17 miles or so. We even came across trail magic at a Skyline Drive road crossing (we cross that road constantly throughout the park). Two locals had a spread of watermelons, cold drinks, and various snacks. We camped near the Riprap trailhead, setting up our tent trailside. We slept with the rain fly half off, looking at the stars and enjoying extra ventilation (a treat after the rain!). We already love the Shenandoah National Park because with waysides and camp stores every other day or so, we only need to carry a day or two of food at a time. Light weight!
6/5 we passed out first wayside for lunch. Even though it was a 0.6 mile side trail, it was totally worth it. Burgers and a root beer float! The weather was also perfect again. We hiked about 18 miles to Pinefield Hut and camped in our tent. That morning, we also came across some trail friends we hadn’t seen since the Smokies! Crazy how that happens. We also passed a family of four bears! There were two adults and two cubs. 
On 6/6 we awoke again to lovely weather - low humidity, low 70s. We passed mile 900! The first hundred mile marker in a long time that was hiked past in nice weather. We passed some day hikers that alerted us of trail magic later on that day. Sure enough, there was a gentleman whose son hiked the AT years ago, set up at a trailhead. He was serving sloppy Joes, plus had all kinds of extra gear hikers may want (zip locks, batteries, rope, toilet paper; the works), as well as cold drinks and snacks! We also saw two bears! On both instances, the bear looked at us and eventually moved on. It sort of feels like they are giving you the finger as they look over their shoulder at you and storm away. Sorry for being in your world, bears! We camped trail side, after an 18 mile day.
On 6/7 - another nice day, we hiked to Big Meadows wayside for lunch. We ran into many trail friends that we weren’t totally aware were all still nearby. We also decided to splurge for a basic cabin at Skyland that night. Sort of an early birthday gift from Penguin to Shiver. We hiked the 18+ miles there, past another three bears (a mom and two cubs who seemed very used to being photographed). We enjoyed the restaurant and a nice shower at Skyland! 
This morning, on 6/8, we enjoyed Skyland’s breakfast buffet, then headed out. We past another two uneventful bear sightings. Today was mostly sunny, but became quite humid. It was a fairly standard day. We passed many day hikers. This evening though, we met up with Shiver’s parents at Elkwallow Wayside, after an 18 mile day. They will be crewing for us for the next week! We will be slack packing during the day, then camping with them at their camper in a local campground for nights. Slack packing pretty much means we will only carry water and food, and maybe a couple essentials. Shiver’s parents will pick us up in the afternoons and drop us off in the mornings as we move North. We are at their campground tonight in Luray. We are very grateful for their support!","Skyland

Last Saturday, 6/9, Shiver’s parents dropped us off (after an amazing breakfast of eggs, sausage, and toast) back at Elkwallow Wayside. We met up with Penguin’s good friend from high school - Amy, who lives in DC and came out to join us for the morning! It was such a treat to hike with a friend - almost like bringing a friend to work. Amy hiked with us for 5 miles (then had to hike those miles back to her car - so she did a solid 10 miles of AT hiking!). The first part of the day flew right by because of that. We were so touched and honored to have the support of a friend like that. We continued our hike, over a couple last peaks in Shenandoah National Park, including Mount Marshall, then began our descent out of the mountains, toward Front Royal. We ended that day at VA State Road 602 after 18 miles, where we were picked up. That afternoon we officially exited the National Park - making it the whole way through with no rain! There were severe storms that night so we were thrilled to be off trail for the evening. Slack packing was also quite the enjoyable experience! 
Sunday 6/10, we were dropped off right where we left off again. The morning was fairly uneventful. We crossed under interstate 66, then we met up with one of Penguin’s oldest friends, Rob, and his girlfriend Kerri. They brought us a delicious lunch, and then hiked the last 8 miles of our 18 mile day with us! Sadly, their half of the day was the foggiest, rainiest, muddiest it had been in the past week. We were thrilled to have them to help us pass the time taking and catching up, while the trail was less than exciting. We felt bad that they got such a lame piece of the trail - they’ll just have to come back and hike with us again soon!! We were picked up just south of Sky Meadow State Park. Shiver’s parents also helped us get Rob and Kerri back to their car (they really were immensely helpful this week!!), then we all met up with Shiver’s sister Alice again (who as you recall, lives nearby) and her boyfriend Charles at the campground. We had feast of fried chicken, watermelon, and homemade brownies, and had a campfire that night!
Monday 6/11, we hiked on, in continued fog, mist, and mud. Today we started the Roller Coaster - a 14 mile section of constant, steep up and downs (about .5 miles each). This was a shorter distance day because we were ending the day by meeting up with Shiver’s parents at Morgan’s Mill Road to provide passing hikers with trail magic!! They were set up with grilling hot dogs, cold drinks, cookies, fresh fruit, and camp chairs! On such a dreary day, and mid Roller Coaster, hikers were extremely thrilled to have the trail magic! About 20 hikers came through.
Tuesday 6/12 brought the return of perfect weather! Alice and Shiver’s parents’ dog, Rusty, hiked with us for the first 7 miles, continuing the Roller Coaster and passing mile 1000! Also, Alice procured her trail name that morning! (FYI - family/friends/trail angels who are involved with the trail can be given trail names.) Rusty decided he needed to stop for a bathroom break right in the middle of the trail, not 300 feet from the start of the day. Alice then had to carry a bag of presents from Rusty, in her small day pack, for the duration of the 7 miles, constantly smelling slightly of you-know-what. We promptly gave her the trail name - “Dog Poop.” She will go by Dog for short. So Shiver, Penguin, and Dog, made it to Snickers Gap (Route 7) where Dog met up with the parents and Shiver and Penguin hiked on! We finished the 20 mile day, completing the Roller Coaster and descending to Keys Gap. We were picked up and again spoiled by Shiver’s parents, at another campground, with dinner and spending more time with Dog and Charles.
Wednesday 6/13, we hiked the sprint to Harpers Ferry! We crossed the Shenandoah River, then stopped by the AT Conservancy Headquarters, where we had our photo taken for the registry of this year’s hikers at the “spiritual halfway point.” We then met up with Shiver’s parents again as we hiked down to the Potomac River on the east side of town, completing that leg of our journey. We spent the rest of the day walking around Harpers Ferry, running a few errands, and having an early birthday celebration / halfway AT celebration with the family. 
Yesterday 6/14, we packed up camp and were dropped off at Dog’s apartment for the day, to spend some more time with our kitten and run a few more errands. We are off for a couple more days for some family business and are excited to get back on trail Monday!!
One last thing for this week! This afternoon we received a message from our Santa Fe Opera family. A bunch of our close friends who work there (or worked there in recent years with us) got together and pitched in to get us a night in a hostel and a dinner, in a trail town. We are so so touched by the amount of support and care everyone has expressed since we have begun this journey. It absolutely means more than anyone could know. SFO people who were a part of this: Thank you thank you thank you! We will be sure to take photos of when we use this gift and show you what you got us!","Keys Gap

The morning of Monday, 6/18, Dog (Hannah’s sister) dropped us off back in Harpers Ferry and we were back at it! We hiked in mid 90 degree temps and high humidity - a lovely welcome back to the trail. We eased back into it with a 16 mile day, camping at Rocky Run Shelter, our first night in Maryland. Penguin surprised Shiver with a dehydrated apple crisp dessert, with candles on top, for her birthday - a nice end to a hard day. We stayed in our tent to escape the bugs. On hot nights like this, if we find ourselves in the tent and it is not supposed to rain, we leave the rain fly off the tent, allowing for extra air flow to keep cool. Essentially the rain fly is an extra layer of fabric draped over the tent, which is actually mainly just mesh otherwise.
Tuesday 6/19 brought high temps again, but it was mostly cloudy, with a passing rain shower. We passed the Old Washington Monument that morning, then crossed over interstate 70. The day was largely uneventful other than that. We hiked 16 miles to Ensign Cowall Shelter, where we again tented.
Wednesday 6/20 brought more passing rain showers intermittently. We encountered trail magic at Pen Mar Park, of deli sandwiches and assorted sides and drinks! Immediately after, we crossed the Mason Dixon Line, entering Pennsylvania and saying bye to the South! We arrived after 18 miles at Tumbling Run Shelters just before a thunderstorm. This shelter so unique because it is actually two small shelters side by side, one labeled snoring, one non-snoring (no one seemed to follow these guidelines...). This shelter also was very cared for by volunteers, with a flower in a vase on the picnic table, hand sanitizer and toilet paper in the privy, and overall was very clean. The caretaker happen to be leaving as we arrived and handed us cold cans of soda! It rained into the night.
The morning of 6/21 it was still rainy (and foggy) as we left camp. We hiked over increasingly rocky terrain as the day went on. We encountered trail magic again for lunch! Two twin brothers (trail names: Oak and Twin Oak) were grilling hot dogs and assorted snacks and drinks! A delight after a dreary long morning. The rain tapered off and we hiked 19.5 miles to Birch Run Shelter. Don’t worry - the forecast called for rain the following morning too.
The rain at least held off long enough for us to get out of camp. On 6/22 we finally hiked past the official halfway point! Equally daunting and exciting, frankly. We stopped by Pine Grove Furnace State Park General Store and tackled the traditional half gallon challenge with success! We each ate an entire half gallon of ice cream! A short rest and we hiked on, making the day’s total 17 miles at James Fry Shelter. We stayed in the shelter, since it was again raining and continued to throughout the night. 
This morning, 6/23, we hiked on in the rain. We hiked 12 miles into Boiling Springs, over a bunch of small mountains then through expansive pastures. Dog picked us up there, since she really wanted to hang out with us one more time before we hike out of range. We are all staying at a motel nearby. The usual hiking chores of laundry and resupplying are completed.","James Fry Shelter

The morning of 6/24, we had breakfast at Cafe 101 in Boiling Springs. The day before, a gentleman handed Penguin a $20 gift card for the cafe, insisting we take it, saying he owed a favor to a hiker and needed to pay it forward. We of course expressed our gratitude. After breakfast, we grabbed a couple things at the local outfitter - Penguin realized his insoles had worn paper thin after being used for 500 miles, so upgraded to a new pair, which would make the rocks significantly gentler on his feet. We then hiked the 15 miles across Cumberland Gap, mainly traversing open farmland - a nice change from the steep mountains. We ended the day hiking back up to Darlington Shelter and just manages to beat an afternoon thunderstorm. 
Monday 6/25, we hiked into Duncannon - a town the trail crosses straight through for 3 miles. It is home of the famous (or infamous?) Doyle Hotel, a self proclaimed dump, that houses a dive bar/restaurant and hotel, with rooms for $25. Let’s put it this way - you get what you pay for! We had heard some horror stories, but had to at least have lunch there. The burgers and beers were delightful at least, as well as the personalities! We then hiked back up into the mountains again after following US Route 22 across a couple wide rivers. The day ended after 15 miles at Clark’s Ferry Shelter.
Tuesday 6/26, we again awoke to sunshine. We hiked a long, relatively uneventful 21 miles to a trail side camp site next to a little pooling spring to replenish our water. We did walk past an old, abandoned coal mining town that is now a campsite - but other than knowing that fact, there wasn’t much to see. It felt nice to do a longer day. At the end of those 20+ mile days, you really feel like you earned your dinner and sleep.
On 6/27, we awoke to rain. Luckily it tapered off as we began hiking. We hiked down to Rausch Gap where we had to don our crocks and wade through about 200 feet of trail that had been flooded by a beaver dam built on a stream adjacent to the trail, which was different and exciting. The rain resumed as we hiked on. We had lunch under Interstate 81 as the trail went that way and got us out of the rain. This was the last time we cross I-81 - hooray! We hiked on, going down and back up a few long, steep gaps between mountain ridges in the rain. We arrived at 501 Shelter after 21 miles. It was full, but the forecast was for storms overnight, so we grabbed some space on the floor between bunks. (This is commonly done; especially in bad weather. We were not the only ones doing it on that night.) This shelter was actually an old pottery studio, and fully enclosed, complete with running water adjacent to it as well as a solar shower, trash can, and power outlet that is switched on for a few hours per day by the caretaker who lives nearby! To be clear, we usually have to carry all our trash with us, so a trash can not only lets us avoid that, but allows us to empty what we’ve been carrying all week! We were extremely glad to be in that shelter, because that night was some of the worst storms we have ever seen. It felt like we were in the heart of a severe thunderstorm for hours, with non stop thunder, lightning, and torrential rain. We were giddy to be dry and inside! However in the back of our minds, we knew that all the water coming down was going to make the trail very.... well.. wet.
We awoke early on 6/28 to the sun shining into the shelter. We heard that the nearby road into town was flooded and closed - the first clue that the rain did some damage. We hiked over very wet and slippery rocks, on a muddy trail / stream.  Midday we actually hit a section of trail that was under between 6” and 2’ of water off and on for many miles. Shiver slipped and her hiking shoe went in, so at that point, already wet, she hiked full force forward into the water in her hiking shoes. Penguin opted to put on crocks and try to keep his boots relatively dry (well, still damp from yesterday’s weather). He managed to stay dry for a few miles of wading (though that is a slow process in crocks, since they are much harder to hike in with less support). He thought the water had subsided at one point and put his boots back on. Shortly after, the trail again became submerged, and he put a boot fully in the water, trying to avoid it. So he then joined Shiver, confidently hiking on with full boots and socks underwater. Oh well! We hiked 15 miles to Eagles Nest Shelter, where many other hikers all sat complaining about the day’s trail conditions. Ultimately it was a challenging day and an interesting experience - another day at the office out here. We stayed in the shelter to avoid any threats of rain. 
Yesterday, Friday 6/29, we awoke to find the sun was out and the water had receded significantly. We hiked 9 miles into Port Clinton, where we hitched a ride to Hamburg with a very proud local who drove us around his town pointing out all the landmarks. We stayed at a motel and took care of all the standard town chores, then just relaxed with our feet up, in the air conditioning. Also, we split a motel room with a fellow hiker, Alchemy, who we have been hiking near, periodically, since around mile 100! A successful town day.","Eagles Nest Shelter

Saturday, 6/30, we got a ride back to the trailhead in Port Clinton and we were once again, on our way. The forecast for this coming week was for a record breaking heatwave, with heat index values well into the 100s - and we immediately felt it. This week was also going to bring us across the northern most part of PA, known for some of the trails most challenging rocks. The rocks are always a little different, but vary from constant, unavoidable sections of sharp, pointy rocks to massive boulder fields. Sometimes you can sort of chose to walk around the rocks, but usually you have to chose the least painful looking ones and walk on them, or climb up and down the boulders. It is very challenging and makes for a slow pace, especially in the heat. We hiked a hot, rocky 15 miles to Eckville Shelter. This shelter was on a road, where the caretaker lives on property. It was complete with flush toilet, solar shower, phone charging outlet, and a mowed field for tenting. We set up our tent with no rain fly, for maximum ventilation in the heat, since the forecast had zero chance of rain. We also both enjoyed showers - the solar shower was still cold, but it was welcomed after the hot day.
On July 1, we got up earlier than normal to try to beat the heat of the day, especially since we had a big climb first thing in the morning. Typically, it wouldn’t be unusual for hikers to hike over night hours with flashlights in this situation, when the heat of the day can be such a challenge - however the rocks of PA prove too dangerous, in our opinion, to cross at night. Most hikers agreed with this as well. Anyway, we hiked a rocky 11 miles before lunch, where we crossed a road that had a restaurant in sight of the trail. It was a no-brainer to go sit inside for an hour and have lunch, with lots and lots of ice water. The day continued, into the hottest part of the day. We climbed over a section called Knife’s Edge - a series of very steep, jagged boulders, high on an exposed mountain ridge, where it felt like you could do some serious damage falling for a long way over rocks if you had a bad misstep. We agreed it would be treacherous in the rain. The sun was absolutely brutal (though a cakewalk compared to what we’d need to climb the following day, we’d soon learn). We then climbed another challenge, steep boulder pile/mountain - Bake Oven Knob. We camped at Bake Oven Knob Shelter. This day also began a new challenge that this part of PA is known for: very limited water sources. Lucky us to hit it on a record breaking heat wave. So Penguin hiked down the steep, seemingly endless (probably about half a mile) trail to the spring to fill up all our water while Shiver took care of all the other camp chores. We made plans to get up even earlier the next day, and looked carefully at the map to pick when to stop for water and how much we would carry, while trying to avoid hitting the most challenging parts of the day in the hottest hours.
On 7/2 we were up before 5am and hiking by 6, as the sun came up. It seemed to be hot the second the sun came up. We hiked 7 miles to the next shelter, where the spring was more accessible. We filtered enough water to carry 4 liters each (we usually carry 2), plus extra to quench our thirst and try to sort of “camel up” our bodies if that’s possible. This put us in Lehigh Gap around 10:30a - which is before the hottest part of the day, but still made the climb out of the gap to Blue Mountain Ridge absolutely brutal. This is notably challenge section normally, due to the fact that it is over an old zinc factory site that has caused severe deforestation. It is currently a superfund site as the EPA works to revegetate, but progress is slow and minimal. So instead of the usual rocks of PA all over the trail, this is pretty much just a big exposed pile of sharp rocks with no roots or trees - a roughly one mile long, extremely steep, rock scramble. In the heat, the hot rocks seemed to cook you from beneath while the the sun had you from above. And since the land is polluted from the superfund site, the single water source on the rocky ridge is  contaminated with heavy metals and is only to be used in emergencies, even after filtering. That mostly exposed ridge continued for about 5 miles, before the trail climbed down into Little Gap, and PA’s normal rocky trail resumed. This trail section is a known challenge for its lack of water, so locals and ridge runners (AT Conservancy staff who patrol the trail, doing maintenance and making sure all is well) often leave water jugs at road crossings. Of course, they are usually empty from hikers that pass earlier, and this was true a Little Gap. We never rely on it. Our 4 liters each seemed to be working ok - though in that heat, you almost feel dehydrated the second you start hiking, as the sweat just pours out. We stopped for lunch and sprawled out on some boulders in the shade to cool down, letting our bodies cool off while the heat of the day passed some. We had planned to stop at a trailhead for a spring that was over 0.6miles off trail, down a steep, rocky hillside. Ultimately, we chose to hike farther for a water source that wouldn’t require us to climb extra mountains. We ended up seeing an ad for a local hostel at a road crossing shortly after that (making our day 20 miles), and decided to call and stay there for the night. For $10 each, we were picked up at the trail, driven to the nearest town to pick up sandwiches for dinner, ice cream, and a few beers, then brought to the home of Mechanical Man. We stayed with other hikers on the floor of a cool, comfortable, garage, complete with a dehumidifier and natural cooling. We enjoyed a needed shower and filled up our 4 liters each again for the next day, bracing for the same challenges again.
We were hiking early on 7/3 again, determined to get down and up Wind Gap before it got too hot. This day wasn’t quite as terribly hot, with some much needed cloud cover. There was still an excessive heat warning. The climb in and out of Wind Gap was not too bad, compared to yesterday. The rocks seemed to get sharper, more unavoidable, and more painful though. We hiked a fairly quick 18 miles to Kirkridge Shelter - which had an amazing luxury - a water spigot! The dry section of trail had finally ended. 
We finally made it to the 4th of July - the day Penguin’s parents would pick us up for some much needed rest (as we hiked the entirety of Maryland and PA with no days off). We hiked into the town of Delaware Water Gap and stopped for a quick lunch at an amazing bakery. We then crossed into New Jersey!!! We were quite happy to leave the heat and rocks of PA behind. NJ is rocky too, but the PA rocks seem sharper and tougher. The trail crosses the Delaware River, entering NJ along side of interstate 80. We enjoyed walking at the speed of cars stuck in traffic as people waved and said “happy trails.” We hiked with the hordes of holiday day hikers up out of the gap in NJ. As we passed Sunfish Pond and headed up Kittatinny Mountain / Raccoon Ridge, we found ourselves caught in a lightning storm - not your ideal situation for a semi-exposed high ridge line. We hiked at jogging speed to try and get away from the storm as lightning seemingly struck around us. We finally made it to Camp Road where Penguin’s parents had just pulled up. Also at the road, we found some trail angels grilling burgers under a big tent for trail magic, so we caught our breath and enjoyed a couple burgers and beers with our family before heading home.Also - as a reminder, we have many more photos on this website than the single one you see at the top of each entry (there are now 100 total photos).

Penguin and Shiver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597294,"Sunday, July 8th, Penguin’s parents took us out to breakfast at the Chester Diner, then dropped us off back at the AT. We had an amazing few days off in NJ - spending time with family, going to the beach, deep cleaning and repairing some gear, and just resting. Just like leaving vacation and going back to work, getting back on trail can be slightly challenging, but the weather was great and after a few hours of hiking, it was as if we never left. We came across some trail magic - a couple coolers left with fresh fruit and drinks on ice - which came at the hottest, most perfect part of the day! We hiked 15 miles to Brink Road Shelter. The online comments about this shelter warned that it had a lot of mosquitos. This was an understatement. As the mosquitos launched a massive assault against us, we set up the tent and dove in. Camp chores were done while wearing a rain coat (they bite through normal clothing) and face bug net, along with socks pulled up high. Just another day at the office!
We ran out of camp the morning of 7/9, eating breakfast a little later so we would escape the bugs. We hiked past the Culver Fire Tower, which was the first fire tower we have passed that is currently in use. You could hear the chorus of the fire watchman’s radio high up above us. We met with our good buddy, Switchback (NoBo ‘17), who has been giving us advice on this trip since we started planning. He and his dog brought us some trail magic for lunch, then hiked a few miles with us - such a treat! We hiked through more lovely weather for 19 miles to the NJ High Point State Park headquarters. We are so lucky to have another friend in the area who was able to pick us up here. Our friend Colin took us back to his home nearby where we went swimming, showered, did laundry, ate an amazing dinner, and sat by the campfire. We stayed there and he made us breakfast and dropped us off in the morning. What a delightful treat to get recharge and relax again. 
Colin dropped us off on 7/10 and we hiked on. In the first hours of the day, we had a bear sighting! A medium sized black bear was on the trail straight ahead of us. Just like you’d hope, we saw each other and the bear immediately ran off. This was forecast to be the hotter day of the week, and it certainly was. We hiked through many pastures, crossing the low lands of NJ - normally a treat, but the sun was killer! In the afternoon, we hiked past an old forest service building with a cold water spigot for hikers to use. What a gift on a hot day. We thought about camping right next to it! But we stuck to our mileage plan and hiked on, up and over Pochuck Mountain. We hiked 16+ miles and camped trailside at a water source halfway down the mountain. The skies became dark and thunder got louder, so we finished camp chores and hunkered down, prepped for a storm (sitting, overheating in a stuffy hot tent). Of course, the storm just missed us! We were glad to keep everything dry.
On 7/11 we hiked through a large bog area first thing - on lovely flat boardwalks. We then trekked over Wawayanda Mountain. We encountered trail magic at a road crossing of a cooler filled with sodas, and a woman restocking it. We talked a bit and thanked her. It had also become clear in recent days that the heat and lack of rain was causing dependable water sources to run dry. We started only counting on sources that were listed as a well or spigot; usually at trail side buildings. It also became common for trail angels to leave lots of gallon jugs or water at road crossings for hikers. This would happen frequently in the coming days. We scaled lots of rocky outcropping as we crossed the boarder into NY from NJ. Late in the day we took a short side trip to an ice cream shop just down the road from a crossing, enjoying a pre dinner treat (and to fill our water bottles). We completed our challenging 22 mile day at Wildcat Shelter.
7/12 was probably one of our most challenging days yet. It seemed that the entire day was spent on near vertical climbs. We descended down to the NY State Thruway, then climbed way back up into the mountains, entering Harriman State Park. This was special because we did our shake down hikes (practice hikes) here, and we enjoyed the familiarity. We stopped at some vending machines at a picnic area for sodas and ice cream (ice cream two days in a row!) - and again, to fill up on water at a spigot. We competed the 20 mile day just before sunset at the Brien Memorial Shelter. We set up our tent in the perfect patch of grass in a boulder filled terrain, with a nice view of the landscape around us - enjoying the weather without the rain fly.
Friday 7/13, we only had three steep mountains to climb (usually a daunting task, but no big deal after yesterday). We climbed up Bear Mountain, which was swarmed with people from the NYC area on day hikes. It was odd to feel a hint of the hustle of the city we had lived in a few months ago. At the bottom of Bear Mountain is a picnic area at the Hudson River. Someone was handing out cold beers to thru hikers as trail magic (discreetly)! We then walked through the interesting Trailside Zoo. It’s mainly filled with animals we see every day (that are mainly there for rehabilitation after injuries, etc.). We passed a black bear enjoying being sprayed with a sprinkler in the bear den, which happens to be the lowest point on the entire AT 120’ above sea level. After hiking across the Hudson on the Bear Mountain Bridge, we were picked up by our friend Jess who lives in the area. Another trail angel - helping us resupply, feeding us a lot, and providing us with a bed to sleep in.","William Brien Memorial Shelter

Saturday morning, 7/14, our friend Jess dropped us off back at the base of Anthony’s Nose. We immediately had a very steep climb out of the Hudson River Valley. There’s nothing like a tough climb right out of the gate to get your butt in gear after half a day off. The rest of the day was fairly boring, moderate up and downs constantly. We had lunch at a deli next to a road crossing, which is always a treat. The humidity was very intense. We camped trailside in a valley, complete with aggressive and plentiful mosquitos, after a 16+ mile day. We finished the chores and got in the tent just as a chain of storms began, which continued throughout the night.
7/15 was one of those mornings where the trail was primarily an annoyance - between the humidity, lingering rain, bugs, and fog. We awoke to lots of mosquitos watching us on the other side of our tent walls - a lovely site to see first thing in the morning. Alas, we sucked it up and hiked on (because what other choice is there?). We stopped mid morning at a lake with a state park beach / picnic area with running water and a bit of civilization to take a break and reboot. This helped improve morale. We came across trail magic at RPH Shelter for lunch, where there was a large team of volunteers in the middle of a multi-day, aggressive trail maintenance mission. They had a large cooking area set up to feed the volunteers and were also feeding passing hikers throughout the weekend. We me some amazing people, including a few gentlemen who helped create the trail in that area (which originally was many miles of road walking), and even built some of the nearby shelters and dug some wells that we used. It’s always inspirational to meet people like this, and it certainly brightened our day. They had been busy re-cutting the trail after tornados came through the area in recent months making it barely passable. The weather forecast was threatening heavy rain all afternoon, and into the evening, but thankfully it never happened. We completed our 17+ mile day, with many ups and downs, and camped at Morgan Stewart Shelter.
Monday 7/16, the humidity continued to be a nuisance, to say the least. We were again under a heat advisory. We stopped for lunch at a food truck parked at a road crossing, then refilled our waters at a local business that is hiker friendly, before going back up into the mountains. We found some old trail friends that we had not seen in a while, which is always exciting. We crossed into Connecticut for the first time, then hiked up and over Ten Mile Hill (which is about a mile up then a mile down, ironically), then camped down by the intersection of Ten Mile River and The Housatonic River. We swam in the river, which was delightful. The day’s mileage was about 20. Again, rain held off.  
7/17, the humidity was worse than ever. With a planned stop in Kent and a shorter day, we started early to try and avoid the inevitable thunderstorms and rain that were forecast to arrive. We made quick work of a handful of intensely steep climbs and made it into town just as thunder started to rumble. We resupplied and happily spent the night in town, glad to be off the slippery rocks in the rain storms, and hopeful the humidity would finally subside tomorrow.
Sure enough, Wednesday 7/18 was a beautiful day, with temps in the 70s and mild humidity. The day took us up and down many times, sometimes steeply (see a pattern?). We hiked a strenuous 17 miles to Pine Swamp Brook Shelter, where we camped and enjoyed the dry weather. 
On Thursday 7/19, we were up early. We hiked over a few mountains then dropped down into Falls Village. We were treated to some trail magic of snacks and drinks, and met some lovely trail angels, before passing Great Falls and ascending back up Mount Prospect, a gentle but seemingly never ending climb. On top of Mount Prospect, we met one of the Ridge Runners for this section of the trail, a nice guy named Wankles. We enjoyed talking about his job, and getting some tips and info about the trail ahead. He also thru hiked the trail in 2016. Up and down more, then back low into Salisbury. We stopped here and were picked up by Penguin’s father for a planned zero day with family in NJ.","Pine Swamp Brook Shelter

It's been a while, so hang on tight (and maybe read this in two sittings if you need to...)!
On Saturday 7/21, Penguin's parents again dropped us off at the trail head in Salisbury, CT. We had perfect weather for climbing some of our first 2000+ foot peaks since Virginia!  We scaled Bear Mountain (the highest peak in CT), then crossed in Massachusetts.  Another state down!  Up and down a few more challenging peaks, then we set up our tent at Glen Brook Shelter.  The forecast was for rain, so we made use of a rare tent platform (essentially a wooden deck to set up a tent on).  This helps us minimize rivers of water that tend to flow beneath the tent, as well as limits spatter of mud that coats the bottom of the tent sides.  The rain did indeed come.
We awoke 7/22 to dripping rain and fog.  We begrudgingly packed up the wet tent and damp gear, and headed up and down some mountains with fog obstructed views.  We hiked down into the valley near Great Barrington as the weather improved (well, became muggy and buggy, but less rainy). We hiked back up into the mountains, and after a rather boring (yet challenging 20 miles) day, opted to stay in South Mount Wilcox Shelter after.  There were a few mosquitoes, but frankly, dealing with a wet tent is equally frustrating.  It was forecast to rain overnight again (and it did). Ultimately, getting a couple mosquito bites overnight is probably equal to what happens during trying to set up and get in and out of the tent anyway.  We stayed in the shelter with the first set of SoBos (south bound thru hikers), which is exciting.  Baxter State Park in Maine is not open until June 1, so by now, we are finally starting to all be in the same place.  It is a similar vibe to when we started the trail, with people constantly comparing gear and talking about how hard it is going to be.
On 7/23, it was again raining when we got up - of course it was easier to manage, being in a shelter.  We let the heaviest of the rain taper off, then headed out. More wet, foggy mountains.  We stopped for lunch at a little self service snack stand that a local has set up, in a shed outside their home, with a picnic table. The weather cleared up briefly, but then the rains became torrential as the afternoon went on. We hiked 15 miles to Upper Goose Pond Cabin, an actual cabin!  It is complete with a bunk room, fireplace, porch, close lines, multiple picnic tables, docks and boats, and a caretaker that makes coffee and breakfast for hikers.  It was a perfect spot to wait out the rain for an afternoon/evening. 
The rain had subsided (for the most part) finally on Tuesday 7/24.  The elevation for the day was not to challenging, so we made easy work of the 21 mile trek into Dalton, MA. As we got into town, a local trail angel (who is widely known) offered us a couple of cold drinks, so we sat and chatted for a bit.  We then headed to our motel.  The motel staff are very hiker friendly, and helped by doing our laundry while we showered (a huge gesture, since it frees up our valuable time in town). We ordered food from a sub shop down the block, then picked up a few beers and just sat, relaxing.  
We let ourselves sleep in a little on 7/25.  Sure enough, it was pouring heavy rain when we got up, and we were both still totally exhausted.  We made the choice to take an unplanned zero day in Dalton on this day.  The forecast was calling for more heavy rain until the following morning.  We took the bus to Walmart for resupply, and did more relaxing.  A perfect zero day. 
We were hiking first thing in the morning on 7/26, despite more rain.  It was tempting to just live in Dalton now, with the rain - but that would not get us closer to Maine! We hiked up a mountain after leaving town.  This morning, Penguin had a particularly scary tumble.  He stepped just right on a slick rock, and went sliding right off the edge of the trail, going head over heels a few times down a steep embankment.  He pretty much just braced for some sort of terrible pain and/or loss of consciousness, while a blur of trees and rocks whizzed past. Suddenly, after the longest few seconds that have ever happened, he stopped moving - and somehow was fully aware, and in no obvious, immediate pain. A small tree on the mountain side, about 15 feet below the trail, managed to grab his leg (sort of like little kids hang upside down from monkey bars), and he was just laying half upside down, beneath this tree.  Shiver screamed and came running.  Penguin yelled ""I'm ok! I think...""  Shiver helped Penguin find his glasses that had flown off, and helped him get back up to the trail.  Phew! Lesson learned - careful on the slick rocks.  We took a breather, then hiked down into Cheshire, where we stopped at an ice cream place just off the trail (and took more of a breather).  Another rain storm passed, then the skies cleared up!  We hiked 17 miles, all the way up Mount Greylock, the highest peak in MA.  We paid to stay in the bunk room available to hikers on top of the mountain in an old lodge built by the CCC (used largely by vacationing tourists), and enjoyed the sunset and scenery. 
On 7/27 we hiked down the mountain into North Adams, then back up into the beginning of the Green Mountains.  We crossed the border into Vermont - a big milestone.  Immediately, the mud began. They call it VerMud, and that is without the crazy amounts of rain we have been having.  We could call it VerRiver, really.  We stopped at a shelter for lunch to wait out a passing storm, but the afternoon developed into steady rain, so we hiked on. We ended the day after 20 miles, setting up the tent at Cogdon Shelter.  It is always nice to get the tent wet again immediately...  
We woke up to the sound of more rain (after it rained most of the night) on 7/28.  It was the kind of morning where we just did not want to get up.  We were warm and cozy, and who wants to deal with more rain?  We waited a bit, and sure enough, some rays of sunlight eventually hit the tent and the rain stopped.  We eventually broke down camp and hiked on, through the rivers of mud and slippery rocks (with Penguin stepping more carefully than ever). The terrain and trail conditions proved difficult, and progress was slow.  Again, thunder boomed in the distance as the day went on.  We monitored the weather radar.  As we approached Goddard Shelter before the Glastenbury Mountain Summit, thunder grew very loud and a storm headed right for us.  So we made the choice to duck into the shelter, as the soaking, heavy, torrential wall of water came down from the sky.  We just made it in time.  After a more exhausting morning that expected, and now a newly drenched trail and heavy rains, we opted to stop at here for the day, and go farther the next day instead - with a more promising forecast and slightly easier elevation profile. We enjoyed a spot in the full shelter, with no bugs at all, as it was a bit chilly being above 3500 feet.
We were hiking early on 7/29.  We immediately summitted Glastenbury Mountain, making a quick climb up the fire tower (with a beautiful view of the clouds and treetops, but low visibility as the clouds had not burned off yet). We then hiked along the ridge as the day went on, through the mud.  We were definitely glad we waited to continue the day before, as the trail was more of a mud pit than the river it would have been.  We were sort of able to keep our feet from being 100% soaked.  A certain level of wet feet becomes normal in this terrain. We hiked up Stratton Mountain, and climbed the fire tower on top.  This time, the view was immaculate!  We could pick out all the local ski resorts on nearby peaks.  We made quick work of the trek down the mountain to Stratton Pond Shelter, finishing off a 19.5 mile day, with no rain for the first time in forever. We both helped some other hikers start a campfire, who were about to give up. Overnight it got a bit chilly, and there was a lot of tossing and turning, which prevents anyone from sleeping well.  Hiker sleeping pads are noisy if you do not hold still. 
This morning, we were up early and on the trail.  We had a 10.5 mile trek to VT Highway 11/30, where we hitched a ride into Manchester.  In town, we had a great lunch, did some resupply shopping, and are now relaxing and doing laundry at the Green Mountain House hostel - a lovely place to spend the afternoon.  We are excited to keep on going - VT has been gorgeous despite the rain and mud, and we hear it only gets better from here!","Stratton Pond Shelter

Tuesday 7/31 we shuttled back to the trailhead with the other hostel guests, then immediately hiked to the top of Bromley Mountain. The weather was nice and the mud seemed to be subsiding. It was really cool to hike up Bromley because you follow a ski trail for the last bit and end right at the ski lifts on top. Penguin enjoyed telling Shiver stories about when his dad took him there as a kid. It was a different universe in the summer, without the endless desert of snow that he had previously scene there. We enjoyed lovely hiking conditions and decided to hike a bit farther than we planned as we were making good time. We hiked 20 miles to Little Rock Pond Shelter and enjoyed a clear night in our tent.
August 1 (wow it’s August!), we awoke to approaching clouds. The forecast was for rain of course - how could we expect more than one nice day in a row. Oh well, we take what we can get and embrace it all. We climbed over a lot of elevation, between many gaps and ridge lines. We only got rained on heavily in the afternoon, so not too bad. We again managed to make decent time, hiking 20 miles to Governor Clement Shelter. This is an old stone shelter with a fireplace inside. We started a small fire to lift sprints and dry things out a bit, making a nice ending to the day. 
Thursday 8/2 we immediately hiked up Killington Mountain. The actually summit (and ski resort) is off a steep side trail from the AT. With dense clouds, this was an easy choice to skip it. Maybe another time... On the way down, we passed the 1700 mile mark! They seem to be flying by. The bulk of the day was spent going up and down the massive Killington. The sun eventually came out, as we got to our destination for the evening - The Inn at The Long Trail. The AT and the Long Trail parted ways on this afternoon, with the LT going North to Canada and the AT turning East to New Hampshire. We checked into the inn, took care of resupply in town, laundry, and had dinner at the pub on site - all in all a restful afternoon.
8/3 we enjoyed the large breakfast included with our stay, then hiked on. We prepared ourself for rain, as the forecast called for flash flood warnings for the next 24 hours. We passed a waterfall and a nice boardwalk, then went up and over a steep ridge, dodging any heavy rain during the morning hours. After lunch, the first round of rain storms came. We hiked on - what can you do? We arrived at a shelter called The Lookout. It is technically a cabin on private land adjacent to the AT, but the owners keep it open as a hiker shelter. It was fully enclosed with plenty of space, and a cool lookout tower on top. What a perfect place to ride out the 2”+ of rain forecast to come through overnight. We stayed with some new NoBo friends and some SoBos who were more concerned with where to get their next beers than where they were hiking to next.
On Saturday 8/4 we hung out a bit later than normal, letting the heaviest of the rains end. Eventually it tapered off and we hiked. The weather even became nice after a while (well, sunny and humid). The day had lots of short, steep hills, which seemed routine for this part of the state. We hiked 15 miles to Thistle Hill Shelter. Storms threatened us in late afternoon but ultimately it became a nice clear evening.
Yesterday, Sunday 8/5, the weather was much nicer and we were up early. We hiked quick, with moderate terrain and the thought of arriving in Hanover, New Hampshire driving us forward. The trail had become quite beautiful in VT, but our excitement to get to NH was very strong. We hiked down through the town of West Hartford, then back up into the mountains. Then finally, down into Norwich, VT, where the trail follows roads over the Connecticut River and into New Hampshire! We got lunch at a pizza place in Hanover that offers a free slice to thru hikers, then checked into an AirBnB that we booked, about a 15 minute walk from town (there are no affordable hostels or motels in Hanover). We are taking a zero today, exploring the Dartmouth campus, seeing a movie, and resupplying, then we will hike on tomorrow! Only 3 days til we reach the Whites!","Thistle Hill Shelter

Tuesday August 7th we hiked further into NH from Hanover. The weather was quite humid, as we hiked up Moose Mountain. Storms arrived as the afternoon progressed. We hiked up and down another tall mountain, dodging nearby thunderstorms. The day ended after 17 miles at Trapper John Shelter, where we stayed in the shelter to avoid the continuing rain.
Wednesday 8/8 we awoke to fog and lingering showers. Clouds burned off as we climbed up Mount Smarts, said to be the first taste of NH terrain, with a rock scramble up some very steep boulders to get to the top, after a 3-4 mile climb. The view from the fire tower on top was worth it. The hike down the mountain was not as treacherous, though it did include Penguin stepping into a thigh-deep mud puddle. We laughed a lot at this - what else can you do? We then hiked up and down Mount Cube, yet another challenging climb. We set up camp next to a stream on the way down the mountain after a 16 mile day. 
8/9 we hiked an uneventful 11 miles into the town of Glencliff. We stayed at the Hikers Welcome hostel, did laundry,  resupplied, and prepares to enter the White Mountains the following day. They are known as some of the most challenging terrain of the entire AT, with miles of very steep rock scrambles and stretches of trail above tree line. Hikers plan to hike less miles per day in this section of trail, so we were planning accordingly.
Friday 8/10 we were up early and hiking over the start of The Whites - Mount Moosilauke. After a 4 mile ascent, we made it to the summit just as the clouds parted. The views were absolutely amazing and we were filled with excitement to have more of this in the coming days. The hike down from Moosilauke was extremely challenging, with steep, slick rocks. It felt sort of like descending a cliff side. Shiver enjoys this terrain. Penguin could do without it. Alas we made it down into Kinsman Notch. We continued hiking the steep terrain out of the notch, then camped at Gordon Pond after 14 miles. The weather was quite cool at this higher elevation which we have not dealt with in a long time! Just another thing we will adapt to again. 
Saturday 8/11 we hiked up and down the smaller Mount Wolf, then made the challenging ascent up Kinsman Mountain. For miles we used our hands instead of trekking poles, climbing the steep rock to the top. What a spectacular view, though. Totally worth it. Again, a steep climb down to Lonesome Lake, where we passed the first Appalachian Mountain Club Hut - these full service lodges for people to pay a bunch of money to stay overnight in the mountains at and have dinner and breakfast made for them. Thru hikers can fill up waters, use the bathroom, as well as buy a few things from a shop on site. They also allow a few thru hikers per day to do Work For Stay, meaning you help with dishes and cleaning and are given any leftover food and allowed to sleep on the floor. We plan to take advantage of this at some point but on this day we hiked on to Cascade Brook and enjoyed a nice camp spot along the water. We made a little campfire.
Sunday 8/12 we made the short hike to Franconia Notch where we got a ride into town with some section hikers. We stayed in North Woodstock last night, resupplying and relaxing. We will hike on later today, preparing to go over the famous Franconia Ridge tomorrow!","Cascade Brook

Monday 8/13 we rested in the morning then made our way up the North side of Franconia Notch where we camped at Liberty Springs Tentsite. We staged ourselves here so we could hit the famous Franconia Ridge first thing in the morning the next day. We made a new dinner for us - hot dogs cooked on a skewer over the camp stove burner! 
8/14 we woke up to rain hitting the tent. We waited for it to lighten up then headed out, hiking before 7am. Of course, as we made our way up to Franconia Ridge, we were in dense fog and intermittent rain. Oh well! We hiked up and over the multiple peaks of the ridge in that weather. It was a beautiful and exciting experience, in a miserable way. The terrain was treacherous, per usual these days. Going up and down Mount Garfield was particularly exciting, as there was actually a stream flowing down the cliff that was the AT during the descent down the north side. Finally, the weather cleared up a bit. The rocks started to dry off as we approached Galehead Hut. We were planning to stay there, taking advantage of the AMC Hut work for stay program, but we were told by the staff that we got there too early and they try to save it for hikers who arrive later in the day with less options to stay other places before it gets too late. So onward up the steep South Twin Mountain we went! Luckily, with the clearer afternoon, we had our first amazing view of the day. We hiked another few miles to a stealth campsite before Guyot Mountain, ending the day after 12+ miles.
On 8/15 we awoke to see that our little trailside camp spot had a nice view! The weather cleared up a bit and we let ourselves sleep in a bit, recovering from the previous day. We even took the time to heat up our water for coffee! Usually we just make cold coffee, not wanting to deal with boiling water and taking extra time before we can start hiking. We hiked to Zealand Falls Hut, where we had a baked good and filled up our water bottles (the huts also offer services like this for thru hikers). The day was competed with the rest of the hike down to Crawford Notch. The afternoon brought some very mild terrain for a change, and we enjoyed hiking at a normal speed, cruising the last 8 miles in a few hours. We hitched a ride to a grocery store that a local recommended to us, then hitched to the AMC Highland Center where we stayed the night in the bunk room and enjoyed the dinner and breakfast buffets that were included! 
Thursday 8/16 it was straight back up the mountain, with a 4 mile climb up Mount Webster to kick off the Presidential Range. We chased the clouds off the mountain and the day became perfect. We stopped at Mizpah Hut (or as penguin calls it, Mitzvah Hut) for coffee and a baked good, then climbed up above tree line. The trail is exposed for about 12 miles for this section - known for its infinite views and the dangers of being exposed to weather. It was a beautiful day as we traverses the numerous mountains, ending the day after 12 miles at Lake of the Clouds Hut, at over 5000 feet, just at the base of Mount Washington. We were granted work for stay, which meant in exchange for sweeping the floors, we could sleep on the ground in the main room and more importantly, eat a huge cooked meal with the hut crew, after chores were complete. We also enjoyed watching an amazing sunset and observing Mount Washington (a rare occasion to be seen, as it is almost always submerged in clouds). Because this hut is one of the only places to stay above tree line, they allow thru hikers to pay to sleep on the floor too, if work for stay slots are filled. When the hut’s paying guests went to bed, the dining hall became a massive thru hiker slumber party. 
Early 8/17, we awoke and made ourselves invisible, before the paid guests arrived for breakfast. We did our chores and enjoyed breakfast with the crew! The only downside to work for stay really is that you do not get started hiking until after 9am. We enjoyed the downtime but were antsy to get going, with the forecast predicting worsening conditions as the day went on. They say not to even consider attempting Mount Washington is there is threat of thunder - as it is home to some of the most extreme weather and is so far above tree line. Miraculously, we summited the mountain before clouds rolled in! We intermingled with tourists at the summit (who drove up the mountain on the famous auto road, or took the cog railroad). As a tourist took our photo for us at the summit sign, which we had to wait in line for, we received a small applause and cheers as word spread that we hiked all the way from Georgia. It was a nice moment. We are sometimes treated like celebrities by day hikers and tourists who are visiting. We heard murmurs of “Honey, I just met a couple that hiked here on the trail from Georgia!” We moved on quickly though, aware of the 7 more difficult miles on rocks above the trees with the threat of weather looming. As we took a quick lunch break at Madison Hut, the rain and wind began. Visibility was still mostly clear (though Washington had totally vanished in clouds behind us). Just as we had chase the clouds away, when we began the presidential range the day prior, they chased us right back down. We quickly went up and over one of the AT’s notorious summits - Mount Madison, with whipping winds and rocks quickly getting slick from the rain. Alas, we made it back below the trees and set up camp at Osgood tentsite, after a very challenging 10+ mile day. We pretty much collapsed at camp with sunburn and sore knees. What a crazy day.
This morning (8/18), we let the morning rains stop before emerging from the tent, knowing we had an easy day into Pinkham Notch. We felt surprisingly refreshed. We made quick work of the 5 mile hike, then hitched a ride into Gorham where we are staying at The Barn hostel (yes it is an old barn). We are resting up and are all ready to attack the last ridge line of the whites tomorrow - the Wildcat Mountains!","Osgood Tentsite

Sunday 8/19, Paul, the owner of The Barn hostel in Gorham, drove us back to Pinkham Notch in the coolest ride we have had a shuttle in - a ‘70s Cadillac. As it turns out, with the huge trunk and interior, it is kind of the perfect hiker-mobile. As we arrived, the clouds burned off. We hiked up to the top of Wildcat Mountain and enjoyed beautiful views from the top of the ski area. We followed the ridge line, dipping all the way down into Carter Notch. We stopped at the last AMC Hut that we would pass on the journey, and enjoyed a free baked good and soup, with our hiker discount card. We continued the very strenuous day, up to Carter Dome. We eventually climbed down to Imp Campsite (rather than a climb, the guide book called it a “controlled fall,” and we would deem this accurate), and camped for the night after a grueling 13.5 miles. 
Monday 8/20, we climbed up Mount Moriah, the last major peak of the White Mountains, then followed the long, steep descent to Rattlesnake River. We hiked a short 8 miles to Rt. 2, then stayed another night in Gorham. The short trip this time allowed us to conquer the Wildcat Range with minimal weight. We also ran into some old trail friends in town, which is always a treat.
Tuesday 8/21, we entered the Mahoosuc Mountain Range. We were in a bit of a quandary - with a terrible weather forecast for the following day. We were on schedule to hit the infamous Mahoosuc Notch that day, which is known as one of the most challenging, treacherous parts of the trail. It is said to be fun (but hard) on a nice day, while it can be a dangerous nightmare if the rocks are wet. With this info, we opted to hike two shorter days and hit the notch a day later. So on this day, we hiked 12 miles to the beautiful Gentian Pond Shelter. We ended up with the shelter to ourselves, enjoying the lovely view of the mountains.
We awoke 8/22 to the predicted forecast - wind, rain, and fog. As we hiked up Mount Success, we were immediately soaked. It was a miserable day. On a bright note - we crossed the border into Maine! The terrain was still very challenging, especially in the rain, with many periods of enormous rocks to climb up and down, and long slabs of steep granite to navigate. This made is confident in our choice not to hit Mahoosuc Notch on this day. We eventually made the very long-feeling 10 mile journey to Full Goose Shelter. Many hikers where there, also waiting out the weather before tackling what was to come. 
The morning of 8/23 brought more fog, but within an hour of hiking, it burned off and quickly became a beautiful day. 2 miles into the day, we hit Mahoosuc Notch. Shiver used her rock climbing skills to get us both through us, having lots of fun along the way. The one mile long boulder scramble took two hours, which is normal. We later learned that some trail friends passed through in the rain the day before, taking four hours and including some very scary moments. Right after we successfully navigated the notch, we climbed 1500 feet in about a mile up Mahoosuc Arm - a real challenge considering what the day had already brought. Finally, we made some miles in the afternoon, going over Old Spec Mountain then down into Grafton Notch, ending after 12 miles at Baldlpete Lean-To. 
Yesterday we awoke to nice weather again! We finished the climb up Baldpete Mountain - a massive steep piece of granite. It sort of felt like walking on the moon, only with lots of gravity. We made quick work of the bulk of the day, ending at a road crossing of East B Hill Road, where we shuttled to Pine Ellis Hiker Lodging. We enjoyed a big lunch in the tiny village of Andover, ME. We stayed there last night and are taking a much needed day off there today as well. Back at it tomorrow morning!","Baldpete Lean-To

On 8/26, we departed from Andover after our day off. We made quick work of the climb up Wyman Mountain, but our real work for the day was the decent into Sawyer Notch, climb up Moody Mountain, immediate decent, then again a long climb up Old Blue Mountain. These were some very steep ups and downs. We were however treated to trail magic of grilled hot dogs, potato salad, snacks, and drinks at Black Brook Notch, before Old Blue! We sat for a while and talked with Old Buzzard, the trail angel behind the grill. We finally climbed up Old Blue, full of hot dogs and cheap beer. We stealth camped after crossing the mountain peak in the rain, after 14+ miles. That evening, Penguin snagged the bear bag rope in a tree, struggling for a while, then Shiver stepped in some kind of animal droppings (we suspect human) - another day at the office!
8/27 we made the small climb up Bemis Mountain from the ridge we were camped on. We followed the rooted, rocky ridge down to a valley where we were again greeted with amazing trail magic - chili, hot dogs, burgers, fruit and soda! Then again - up to the next ridge. We took a bit longer with the difficult terrain and trail magic than expected, so we stopped at our short goal for the day - Sabbath Day Pond Lean-To, after 12 miles. 
8/28 we were up early to make the 10 mile sprint into Rangeley - but just as we opened the tent to get out, it started pouring rain. So we waited it out, before making the trip for the day! It was an uneventful, refreshingly easy hike after that. We hitched a ride into town and enjoyed a relaxing afternoon. We also enjoyed an awesome dinner thanks to a gift certificate from Aunt Nancy and Uncle Rick!! 
8/29 we were dropped off at the trailhead and began the climb up Saddleback Mountain. We were eager to get up and over the ridge, as there is a 2.5 mile stretch above tree line and there were thunderstorms in the forecast. We made the grueling climbs up and down Saddleback, The Horn, and Saddleback Junior, before the weather turned! We were safe in Poplar Ridge Shelter, after the 10 mile day, when the storms hit - the best place to be! 
8/30 we hiked down from the ridge, then up Lone Mountain. We came across some trail friends we have not seen in a bit, which is always nice. We hiked over Spaulding Mountain, moving quick to stay warm in the cold front that had come upon us. After a steep rock scramble down, we camped at Crocker Cirque Campsite after 14 miles. 
This morning we awoke to a beautiful, cool, crisp day. We immediately climbed the very steep Crocker Mountain. We then made the long descent, crossing the 2000 mile marker!! We ended after short day to stay at a hostel in Carrabassett Valley - the Hostel Of Maine. It feels more like a fancy ski lodge than a hostel, and we are enjoying it a lot! Tomorrow we tackle one of the last mountain ranges in Maine on the AT - the Bigelows. After that it mellows out enough for us to get back to our old, fast pace - a sprint to the finish!","Crocker Cique Campsite

Saturday 9/1, Justin - one of the owners of Hostel of Maine, dropped us off at the trail head. Side note - that hostel was awesome. Justin and his wife had amazing info for us, and their dog Zoe liked us so much that she followed us to dinner at the restaurant down the street (only to be dragged back home..). Their resupply store on site was well stocked with great variety and fair prices. Anyone reading this who has the opportunity to go there should! They also cater to Sugarloaf Mountain during ski season. Anyway - we began our hike up to the final mountain range of western Maine - the Bigelows. We made the long, taxing ascent up to the Horns, then went up and down the roller coaster of elevation to West Bigelow and Bigelow Avery peaks. The weather was amazing - with just enough clouds in the sky for some great photos. We passed some trail friends we had been hiking near for a long time. They were planning a shorter day than us - usually this means we will see them somewhere down the line, but this late in the game, maybe not. It is crazy that we are at that point already! We ended at Little Bigelow Lean-To after a challenging, full day of 15.5 miles. For dinner, we enjoyed these awesome custom made dehydrated meals. A section hiker who was ending their hike donated a couple dozen meals to the Hostel Of Maine - leaving them in a hiker box, so we restocked with them! As a refresher - a hiker box is essentially a free gear swap found at most hiker friendly locations. Shiver enjoyed pork herb pasta and Penguin had sweet and sour pork fried rice. These meals can cost over $10 a pop at most outdoors stores. 
Sunday 9/2 we enjoyed our first day of good ole cruising terrain. Minimal steep elevation made for a shockingly easy day - like what we considered normal a few months ago! We enjoyed lovely views of lakes in nice weather, hiking a leisurely 18 miles to Pierce Pond Lean-To. We camped right along the water of the massive pond, enjoying the sunset and another awesome meal.
On 9/3, we were up early to make it to 7am breakfast at Harrison’s Pierce Pond Camps - a remote lodge mainly for hunters and anglers but that is also hiker friendly. We could smell the pancakes from the trail walking up. We both enjoyed a breakfast of 12 large pancakes, eggs, sausage, and coffee! We then hiked a few miles to the famous Kennebec River - the largest unbridged river the AT crosses. Due to the depth of the water and a number of hydro plants upstream that can cause dangerously erratic currents, the ATC sponsors a canoe ferry that is stationed at certain hours during the season to ferry hikers across. This is the official route of the trail - via canoe ferry (not fording). We signed a release form and paddled across with the guide in back, Penguin paddling up front, and Shiver in the middle. The rest of the day included hiking over Pleasant Pond Mountain (which was only hard because of the heat and humidity). We stealth camped after 16 miles near Moxi Pond Stream (usually a ford, but thanks to the dry spell hear, a rock-hop instead). It was a very humid, sticky, uncomfortable evening, hiding in the tent from mosquitos and threatening storms that never really came. 
9/4 we cruised to Bald Mountain (also called Moxi Bald Mountain), which is bald because of a fire on top in the early 1900s. We enjoyed spectacular views on top! The weather was great again, and the day was mostly full of the easiest terrain. We had to ford one river but it was barely ankle deep still. The other normal fords were rock-hops again. We ran into some trail friends we hand not seen since the end of NH, Weezey and Duck, and ended up camping next to them at the East Branch of the Piscataquis River. We fell asleep to flapping and squeaking, which Penguin thought was bats, but Shiver eventually realized was the sound of birds (owls?) hunting for rodents, which would squeal after their attack... ahh nature!
First thing this morning (9/5) we forded the river we were camped next to - a chilly task walking trough knee deep water in the cold morning air. We then donned our hiking shoes and made very quick work of the 7 mile sprint to highway 15 where the staff of The Lakeshore House pocked us up. We are staying there today / tonight, doing laundry, buying the large quantity of food to get us through the 100 mile wilderness without another stop, and enjoying the onsite pub! After the 100 mile, we meet Penguins parents in Millinocket, then finish the last bit of trail up Katahdin! Can’t believe it’s so close. We never thought we could consider 115 miles of hiking to be “close.”","E Branch Piscataquis River

Penguin and Shiver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603150,"Katahdin - Baxter Peak, Maine - Mile 2290Thursday morning 9/6, we caught a ride back to the trail from the Lakeshore House in Monson.  While we were in the car going to the trail, it started pouring rain - not the best feeling when you are clean, dry, and about to enter the Hundred Mile Wilderness for six days straight of camping and hiking.  Oh well - by now we knew quite well that mother nature could care less about any of that.  We began hiking through intermittent showers and thunder nearby.  Luckily, the weather cleared up after just a couple of hours, and the rain never came down too hard.  The day's terrain was tougher than we had been experiencing in recent times - with lots of short, steep ups and downs, but nothing we could not conquer.  Our packs were also very heavy with all the extra food to get us through the long resupply.  Penguin mistakenly led Shiver across a stream that the trail actually did not cross, where she slipped off a rock and dunked her foot in the water.  Another less than ideal way to start the week, but again, not that big a deal.  Oops!  We had our largest river ford, crossing Big Wilson Creek, which was up above our knees.  We used a rope that was run across the water to help us stay standing while we crossed. The day ended at Long-Pond Stream Lean-To after about 15 miles. Friday 9/7 we had beautiful weather as we went up and over the Chairback Mountain Range.  They were not nearly as tough as what we experienced in NH and Western Maine, but still had some steep rock scrambles that took some time to get through.  We crossed the 2100 mile marker.  The day was rather uneventful, ending at the West Branch of Pleasant River after about 16 miles.   9/8, we went across the relatively flat valley before the White Cap Mountains. Shiver seemed to be coming down with a bit of a cold, which was unfortunate, since we were mid-wilderness and unable to easily hop into town for a break or some cold medicine.  Like with most challenges, we hiked on, up and over the White Caps.  They were even easier than the Chairbacks, with minimal steep sections.  Most of the steeper parts had rock steps installed, which trail crews use to mitigate erosion (stone steps are a better option than trails that are just dirt which easily washes away.  Lucky for us, hiking up and down lots of big, steep staircases is actually way easier than scaling sheer rock faces.  At the end of the mountain range on White Cap Mountain, we got our first close-up view of Katahdin.  It was hard to believe the finish line was so close!  We were finally almost there.  Technically, we were only 30 miles or so away, as the bird flies, but we still had roughly 70 miles to hike, due to the snake-like nature of the trail.  This was also the final mountain range before Katahdin.  We had nearly flat terrain between us and the end!  It felt almost like we were done.  Hiking for a few days on relatively flat terrain would be a piece of cake (so we thought...). We ended this day at East Branch Lean-To after 16 miles.   On Sunday 9/9, we faced a very sudden and unexpected challenge.  We awoke to beautiful weather, and were eager to bang out some big miles, planning to hike over 20 miles of flat terrain.  It was quite a cold night, with temps dipping into the 30s.  While Shiver hid in the tent to stay warm for a little longer (doing all the chores in the tent - putting away our sleeping pads, etc.), Penguin was getting the bear bags down and doing the outside chores, about to make breakfast (some warm water for instant coffee and sugary, prepackaged pastries).  Suddenly, Shiver's back went into a severe spasm.  It happened for seemingly no reason. To be honest, she was laughing at a chipmunk that was shaking pinecones out of a tree above us (it was funny - it seemed like we were under attack).  She could not move, and even just breathing became a challenge.  We both panicked.  The end was literally in sight, and all the hard parts were supposed to be over.  Penguin's parents were meeting us at the end of the wilderness.  Plans were in motion.  A summit date was planned - parking passes purchased, hotels booked.  All of a sudden, it seemed like finishing the trail, or even moving 100 feet from the tent, was an impossible task.  With no cell phone service at all, and a few days of food with us - we felt stuck, alone, and isolated from the world.  Our momentum was gone.  We both had a bit of a break-down, which did not help Shiver's physical condition.  It took almost an hour to just get an air mattress re-inflated and under her so she could rest more comfortably.  We had to decide what to do - does Penguin hike a few miles to a mountain top for cell service, then call for someone to pick us up at a remote logging road (there was one within a few miles of where we were)?  Do we call for an expensive wilderness rescue to come get us - is it that serious?  Do we just sit and rest for a day and see if it improves enough to hike?  Are we every going to be able to finish the trail, and do we even care anymore?  It was a rough day, to say the least.  Eventually we decided to spend the day resting.  Penguin made a ziplock bag of hot water for Shiver to hold against her back and help some of the muscles begin to release, which helped a little.  She took a muscle relaxer, which she carried just in case something like this happened, with her history of back problems.  Her condition improved slightly - enough for us to plan on it hopefully getting better overnight.  We planned to take the zero day at this location, then hike even more miles the next two days to get back on schedule (two back to back 25+ mile days).  It would be a lot, but seemed possible.  We were hopeful.  We sat there all day, listening to people hike past us, feeling stuck.  The night brought more very cold temps. In the middle of the night, Shiver woke up still in pain.  We had a talk and decided it was best to plan leave the wilderness the next day.  It was a hard choice to make.  It would mean finishing the trail later than we planned to.Monday 9/10, we were up with the sun.  It was not a restful night, and we were both exhausted.  Penguin loaded as much of our gear as possible in his pack, to make it possible for Shiver to wear her pack still.  He would assist in putting it on her back and taking it off, to minimize bending and twisting.  We hiked 3.5 miles up the small Little Boardman Mountain where we had enough cell service to get a call out.  We called the hostel in Millinocket that offers shuttles on the logging roads that cross the wilderness, and scheduled a pickup for that afternoon.  Shiver felt ok walking, so this was very doable.  We also called our family and let them know about the change of plans.  It seemed like not that big of a deal at this point - just a 1-2 day delay, and we would be back to it.  Our breakdowns the day before seemed unnecessary. It was just a couple more days.  Hindsight is 20/20 we suppose.  We easily made it to the road, hiking over 11 miles, and got a ride out.  A couple nights out of the cold, in a proper bed, with a heating pad, in theory, would do the trick.  We stayed at the AT Lodge in Millinocket.  Tuesday 9/11, Penguin's parents arrived in town. They kept their plans to arrive that day, as we were initially supposed to exit the wilderness. We checked into the hotel we were all staying at, and enjoyed an unplanned, yet restful zero and some good meals.  We lucked out with the weather - this was a rainy day that we would have been hiking in.  We planned to set out again the next morning, back on track. Wednesday 9/12, Penguin's parents dropped us off where we left the trail, paying the logging company for access to the road - this is how these roads work.  They went for a hike along the AT too, after we set out.  We hiked fast, with new excitement and energy, again looking forward to finishing.  We covered 22 miles before it got dark, camping near Crescent Pond.  Thursday 9/13 would be our final day in the Hundred Mile Wilderness - finally!  The weather was beautiful and we were hiking early again.  We enjoyed a short, mid-morning side trip to Rainbow Lake Dam, where there was a gorgeous view of Katahdin.  We were so so close!! The day was rather uneventful otherwise - following Rainbow Lake’s shore for about seven miles, treating us to lots of nice views.  We had a short climb over Rainbow Ledges, then cruised out of the wilderness, meeting Penguin’s parents at Abol Bridge after 19 miles, mid afternoon.  Now it felt like we were where we were meant to be - meeting family in Millinocket after completing the wilderness.  The rest of the trip, we would be doing day-hikes, and staying in town with Penguin’s parents.  We were done carrying the heavy packs and sleeping on the ground.
The next morning, Friday 9/14, we got up and enjoyed a mid morning breakfast at the AT Cafe (where we went most mornings in Millinocket, ultimately).  Penguin’s parents dropped us off back at Abol Bridge,  with nearly empty packs, for us to make the flat 10 mile sprint to the base of Katahdin.  We made quick work of it, enjoying the beautiful weather and pretty scenery. The end of the day presented a minor obstacle.  Because our summit date was postponed, our reserved parking lot access at Baxter State Park (where Katahdin is) was no longer valid for the right time, and the day we needed it for (9/15 - tomorrow) was not available.  Baxter State Park has very strict restrictions on the number of vehicles allowed in daily.  It has to do with the initial vision of how the park was created and keeping the wilderness protected, etc.  (Look it up online to learn more - it is quite fascinating, and also can be a pain in the butt.)  At this point, even minor obstacles were quite stressful.  We just wanted to finish this thing!  We figured Penguin’s parents could just drop us off instead of parking as they intended to, however the park does not allow this.  To make a long story short, we came up with a few different plans to get us into the park the next day, but ultimately ended up reserving a spot in a shuttle that the AT Lodge runs into the park daily.  They have some kind of agreement with the park to run a shuttle in (as this is the only way most thru hikers would get into the park if they were starting a south bound hike).  It seemed like we had overcome yet another challenge.
Finally, summit day had arrived.  Saturday 9/15, we arrived at 6:15a (after breakfast at the AT Cafe) at the AT Lodge to meet the shuttle, driven by Old Man.  Old Man is a local hiking icon, who owns the AT Lodge and also drove our shuttle rescuing us from the wilderness a few days ago. We were in a shuttle with a bunch of other hikers.  As Katahdin came into view from the road, Old Man put on Eye of the Tiger on the stereo and cranked up the volume to pump everyone up at 6:30a.  It was a fun start to the day, and we were in the park, on trail before 8am!  Now we just had to hike!! We moved very fast up the trail, riding the adrenaline to the finish line.  The climb up was 5.5 miles, most of it very steep, featuring a 1.5 mile long boulder scramble that was reminiscent of Mahoosuc Notch.  It was the kind of terrain where it seemed like one wrong move could send you toppling 1000 feet down.  We also passed dozens of day hikers/weekenders, clearly not used to the terrain and the task of moving uphill nonstop - something thru hikers are quite accustomed to.  Sometimes they would try to keep up with us after we passed them (maybe we hurt their ego?), but after a few minutes, we would hear them become out of breath and then they would disappear. We do not blame them - we have been training for this for six months and well over 2000 miles - we better be good at it!  We made it to the top in only three hours - fantastic time.  It was surreal and emotional to make it to the top, at the iconic sign we have seen in so many photos.  The weather was perfect, with infinite 360 degree views.  We received congrats form the plethora of non-thru hikers that were up at the top.  When we arrive at the top, there were probably 20+ others there.  By the time we went to hike down, that number easily doubled. We did it!  We took lots of photos, soaked it in, and had lunch.  Then all that was left was to hike down.  The trip down felt twice as long, with more fatigue and less adrenaline.  Also, downhill is not faster when you are going over boulder scrambles.  If anything, it took a bit longer.  Penguin’s parents made it into the park by the time we were coming down, and actually met us on trail about a mile from the bottom - a welcomed surprise.  We got back to the car, and that was it.  It was finally over!  We all celebrated with champagne in our hotel room then went out to dinner.  We will post another entry at some point, after this all sinks in (hopefully within a week or so).  It is still a bit surreal, as we face the long list of things to address back in real life!  If anyone has any questions they would like answered in an epilogue post, feel free to email us at jeff.englander27@gmail.com and we will have answers!  Thanks everyone for all the support throughout!  We are constantly shocked to hear of people following our journal that we do not even know, and it is heart warming.  More to come soon!","Katahdin Stream Campground
