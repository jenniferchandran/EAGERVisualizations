Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553091,"I noticed a question some hiker posted in the forum section regarding the best way to go about layering for cold temperatures. I left it for other more experienced hikers to give him advice. But as it turned out, even down here in the Deep South, the Good Lord provided me an opportunity to get out walking in some pretty cool temps to test out my own layering gear. Yesterday was a sunny afternoon with the temps in the low 20's. Today it was overcast with the temp hovering around 35 degrees. Both days we had a slight wind of about 10 mph that added to the cold. I layered up with the following: light weight tights on my legs under my hiking trousers. The trousers have the zip off legs which provide that option should I begin to feel overheated. I didn't. On top I wore a base layer long sleeved shirt. I have my cycling sleeves that I could have used under the shirt to provide more warmth to my arms but these weren't needed. Over the shirt I wore a fleece vest and topped that off with my Marmot Windshirt (the best $50 I ever spent). Then I wore my neck gaitor, my toboggan, and light weight runner's gloves on my hands. It all served me well. Yesterday I was comfortable throughout my walk even when I picked up my pace. Today, after the first couple of miles I began unzipping my windshirt and vest and loosening up the other coverings. Funny what that 15 degree difference could do. Anyway, we just don't get that many chances down here to prep ourselves for real cold. I think the weatherman is calling for a daytime high back up close to 70 in a day or so. So, I am thankful for this brief chance to taste winter. You winter hikers out there take care!","The Blizzard of 2017

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554357,"Had an interesting prep walk today. It had been stormy all day here but by 3:30 or so it seemed to have stopped. Boy was I wrong!When I started walking there were only a few drops hitting me. No big deal. But within the first few miles the sky seemed to open up on me. It began to pour. A real frog-strangler! Which reminds me of a conversation I had recently with Paul Stutzman. Paul hiked the trail back in 2008 and followed up his hike with a book, Hiking Through. I recommend it highly. Anyway, I got in touch with Paul because he wrote that he ended up the first day camping in Horse Gap beside a small stream. I've been through there a number of times and know there is no water in Horse Gap. So I had to ask, and upon reflection, he figured it must have been rain runoff which looked like a stream flowing down that hill past their tents. Makes sense. In fact, I walked beside and stepped over a number of such temporal rivulets today. Anyway, getting back to my walk, I was glad I packed along 'Big Red' -- my umbrella. It really came in handy, especially when marble-sized hail began to pelt me. They just bounced off of 'Big Red' and I kept going.By the time I neared the finish of my six miles, the rain had stopped, most of the really threatening clouds had moved off to the East, and I was left with a gorgeous sunset in the West. All in all -- a very nice walk!","Feeling Old

Back in 2013 when I injured myself early and had to abandon my hike that year, I knew it would be two years minimum before I'd get another chance. So I know what that wait is like. Now I'm there again. I've got to figure out how to keep the fire burning for 24+ months and work through a long span of boring workouts, just continuing to log in the miles to keep in shape so that I'll be reasonably ready when the jump-off date arrives.

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523852,"One of the important things about hiking is to spend time examining and evaluating things after the hike is over. What aspects of the hike were you pleased with? What changes would you make? If you've read my earlier entries then you know this is what I've been doing -- asking questions about my 2015 hike. On the plus side, let me say that many things fell into place nicely for that walk. My gear worked well. I had made the right clothing choices. I fell in with the very best of hiking partners. Negatively, I wasn't pleased with some of my food choices. I've also decided that I hate the whole process of camp cooking and especially the cleaning up. So, next time I'm considering going stoveless. The times I've done this in the past have been enjoyable. There is now so much that is available along the trail to sustain a hiker which involves no cooking. Again I've plenty of time to rethink this but I'm convinced I'll go this route next go around. Breakfast will be simple with cereals, pop tarts, and sweet rolls. Snacks will remain much the same with snicker bars, bagels with Nutella, energy bars and protein shakes. Evening Dinners will be where the major differences occur. I'll go with tortilla wraps of string cheese and pepperoni or summer sausage, or use spam singles or tuna. I can supplement this with Fritos or some other chips and follow up with cookies or Cosmic Brownies. The choices are nearly endless. A small jar of Crunchy Peanut Butter, another of Nutella, and a small squeeze bottle of spicy mustard and I should be able to put together something to hold me over till I reach the next town.","Home in Mississippi

It is spaceous inside with plenty of room for me and all my gear. It is light weight and uses trekking poles for support. All in all a very good tent. But I may go back to my MSR Hubba. Why? The footprint. There were times when I had trouble finding enough clearing space to accommodate the LH elongated design. I never had that problem with the Hubba. Also, the Hubba is free standing. I can't tell you the number of pegs I bent trying to set up the LH on rocky ground. Anyway, the trade off is more weight and poles and smaller interior room. But I sleep snugly in the Hubba.

Here's a piece of my own doing. A KINDRED SPIRITI met a turtle along my walk today. Face to face we stood. Each one similarly absorbed in our own thoughts. The pack I wore on my back prompted me to imagine we had much in common. ""Where are you headed?"" I asked. Got no response. Didn't expect one. Looking back along his chosen route, nothing in the immediate vicinity appeared a sufficient enticement to lure my little friend to abandon what was left behind. It puzzled me. Far off in the distance the sparkling surface of a small pond could be seen. It seemed a logical end, but impossibly remote. I questioned his ability to reach it in a day, or even two. Should I have picked up this diminutive nomad and carried him to that distant haven? I could easily have spanned the reach in a fraction of the time. But no, I countered. My help, I reasoned, might rob him of the greater gladness -- the journey over the destination. Only a fellow wanderer would understand. We parted company, each to resume our way along our chosen path. Each a goer and not a stay-put-er in our own rights. Later, after much reflection, my thoughts returned to my hard-shelled friend. Where might be be now? Did he make it to his desired end? Will that spot only prove to be a temporal rest along his extended pilgrimage? I wonder -- does he have similar thoughts of me?","Tents

Just being back up here at this time of the year brings back many memories. It's easy to forget how cold it can be in the lower Appalachians in early April. The temps tonight are to hit 27 degrees. Burrrrt!Was checking the forecast the other day and it announced we were in for ""howling wind"". I thought, ""that sounds interesting."" And it was! Man, I was thankful I was in our cabin and not a tent. Things were falling out of the trees and hitting the roof all night long. Would have been quite scary in a thin veneer of nylon. It's been fun to watch it begin to green up this week. We sit out on the deck and watch Spring creep up the side of the hills. Love it!

You arrive at a shelter or a campsite late in the day and begin to set up for the night and before you know it you've got gear lying around everywhere. It looks as if a small twister came through while you were collecting water and scattered your belongings all over the place. That's a pack explosion. Several times recently my wife has commented on how my hiking gear is all over the house. In spite of her subtle hints I've mostly been able to ignore the obvious. Until recently when I started looking for a particular item and discovered she was correct. Somehow inexplicably and with no direct connection to any person living or dead my gear had become dispersed nearly into every room of the house and I know there's more of it lying up at our cabin in the North Carolina mountains. All I can say is that it's providential that I'm not looking to hit the trail again for another 22 months because it will probably take me that long to find and re-gather my stuff. Oh well. Think I'll start tomorrow. After all tomorrow is another day. Haven't really had time to follow any of this year's hikers. Work has me rather busy. Tried calling my buddy Gorp the other day but didn't get through. Gorp, if you read this and have changed numbers let me know. Trying out some no stove food and meal plan options to see if I think I can go with it. I like the powered hummus but will have to pack along a small bottle of olive oil. The powdered protein shakes are great. For B'fast I will plan to add a packet of Carnation Instant Breakfast. At other times I might just add crunchy peanut butter. I really enjoy slicing up an apple on my peanut butter tortillas. It's a slow experiment but I'm discovering some items and combinations which will serve me well.

"" I find myself thinking of those paths these days more and more. Paths which offer a brief escape from, as Whitman put it, ""the clank of the world. "" The paths, they are there. Some on mountain heights. Some hidden away in the deep recesses of ones heart and mind. But they are there and offer the respite and companionship for which we long. Spring has been a colorful explosion here in the Deep South. With that has come, of course, all the pollen that seems to wreck such havoc on my respiratory system. But God and allergy meds have kept me functioning thus far. I've been limiting my daily mileage as to cut down a bit on prolonged exposure. I may have to work out an AT hiking plan that calls for waiting until after the bulk of the pollen (especially pine and oak) has fallen. Sometimes wish I were more of a winter, cold weather hiker. Oh well!

Got to get serious about trying to save some $$$ for 2018. So far I've not put away a dime. Every time I tuck some away, some need arises and the hiking fund is raided. This month it would seem that we must join with several of our mountain neighbors to lay out several thousand or so on road repair work.

His no nonsense and straightforward advice to novice hikers will be remembered and passed along to others. I'm sure that campfire gatherings will resound with the eager telling of Baltimore Jack stories for years to come. It was as if he were destined to make a mark and leave a lasting impression upon the A.T. as he shared himself with others.

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534491,"I know that twenty-one months is quite a time to wait, but there's also a joy to be found in the anticipation. And I'm confident that anticipation will continue to mount. In the meantime, there is much to do. My work is richly rewarding and I love what I do. It will be a difficult thing to retire and depart from these people. But the best of others we carry with us always. Good friends become a part of us and enrich our own existence with every passing moment. I was reading some Thoreau the other evening where he wrote: ""I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. ""
While I reject Thoreau's overall worldview, and am not as misguided as to personify nature itself, I do accept that there is much we can, and should, learn in nature/creation around us. I am not fearful that it may be that I might possibly pass my days without truly living. I live. But there is more life yet to live, more wonders to discover, more lessons to learn -- even about myself. So I too look forward to another extended stay in the woods and to living with deliberation there as I attempt to do elsewhere. To discover more about the joys of simplicity and experience the friendship of other fellow searchers. Today's photo is one of my favorites. I cannot say how many times I've had the good fortune to awaken early to scale a ridge to witness the birth of morning light in darkened valleys below.

They were great guys to hike with and I am blessed to continue to maintain contact with them. Don't know if any of you tapped into the forum thread on Scott Jurek and speed hiking. After suffering through a few entries I was forced to weigh in on the issue. As I sought to express, I've always been bothered by certain behaviors out there on the trail and sometimes you just have to speak up and address it. But much of the time I think it's wiser to just move on and create some space between you and other offensive hikers. I recall a time when someone's wet dog came bounding into the sheltered area only to shake water all over our food we were cooking. I can't remember the number of times I've chosen to just move away from certain individuals whose speech seemed obcessively peppered with cursing and filth. I routinely stop to pick up candy wrappers and other litter thoughtless folk have dropped. All I'm saying is that we have to just accept that we will run into all types out there.

There was weeding in the flower gardens to be done. I had to attack some borer bee nests and fill in their tunnels with wood filler. The gutters had to be cleaned out and I had to weed wack the path down to the spring. Then one afternoon I worked along side of our road shoveling out the ditch to help prevent erosion of the road in the coming wetter months. So all in all we got quite a bit of work done.

Think of it as honoring a man who was quintessentially kind and courteous of others at all times. Someone who saw the best in others.
I've been hiking on the A.T. for a number of years now. Some of my most special joys have been to meet up with the occasional hiker that seemed to model the same gentle deportment that was seen so easily in Mr Palmer -- hikers who truly cared about others, showed real concern over the needs or hurts of others, and always seemed to have an uplifting and encouraging word to give. No matter what field of endeavor, individuals such as that are special indeed. A number of years ago I was privileged to be in Augusta, Georgia, in attendance at the last round of golf Arnold Palmer played there. Just to stand within yards of this sports giant, to watch him so easily interact with fans, and to behold the humility and gentleness of the man was an experience I'll not soon forget. His golfing skills had long since left him but the fire still burned within.I think of that whenever I meet an elderly hiker who is still out there, still seeking an illusive dream, still putting one slow foot in front of the other, moving northward, following those white blazes. Arnold Palmer would have understood it and applauded the effort. And so, today I drink a large glass of Arnold Palmer Iced Tea -- half tea, half lemonade --and I remember a nice man. It may have nothing to do with hiking, but then again, perhaps it does.","Almost Fall

So glad we didn't have a flat along the way. Got it in to the Michelin man on Monday and they discovered the screw and made the repairs. Was able to spend a portion of today up at Jump Off Rock, a very scenic spot just west of Hendersonville.

On the way back down we rounded a curve and came upon a huge flock of wild turkeys just walking down the road. You have to keep your eyes open around here.

The weather is just grand -- cool and crisp in the mornings and evenings with no humidity to speak of. This is what we've waited all the long hot summer for! Really puts one in the mood for hiking.

I've been a Cubs fan for a long, long time. Like so many others I'd grown quite resigned to the Cubs being the ""loveable losers"" each year. But not this year!
My father-in-law, Wilbur, was another lifelong Cubs fan. About eleven years ago, when he was dying in the hospital, he made the sad comment to my wife and other family members gathered in the room: ""Well, I guess I'm not going to live long enough to see my Cubs win the pennant."" My wife told me this later as I wasn't there and said that everyone just started crying. It was so sad. But I told her that someone there should have said: ""I don't think any of us will live that long!"" That surely would have brought a smile to 'Uncle Wilbur's face. Well, when the Cubs won the pennant, we just had to purchase some balloons and affix some messages to them and send them up, telling Uncle Wilbur the good news.

Just read that the ATC and Park Rangers have closed the AT from Dicks Creek Gap in Georgia all the way to the NOC and the Nantahala River.   The ugly scars of these burns will be seen for a long time. Over the years I've had the experience of walking through sections of the AT after the Rangers have conducted one of their controlled burns. Even those, while necessary, are hard to take. The smell alone makes it difficult for some of us to breathe along those brief sections. But I've never seen anything quite like this so close to our beloved trail, not to mention my own home. The situation highlights what many of us have already discovered -- that the southern portion of AT runs through States which have been experiencing severe drought in recent years. It's very dry out there and we hikers and campers have got to take cautions with campfires and stoves. It may mean that carrying extra water in some sections will become a norm even down in the southern parts. Take care everyone!","CUBS WIN!

The wildfires in eastern TN continue to spread. Gatlinburg, a favorite stopover and resupply point for hikers halfway through the Smokies is closed down. A number of structures in the Gatlinburg area and nearby Dollywood and Pigeon Forge have been destroyed. Whether the blazes can be contained before they head up the slopes into the Park and threaten the trail itself remains to be seen. It's a sad, sad thing to watch. A couple of things I'll be watching for in the journals of the hikers in the upcoming Class of 2017 are the flow of water at certain sources which may dry up early due to the ongoing drought in the South -- and then also the increased bear activity along the trail due to a shortage of natural foods, also due to the drought. Already the number of shelters and trail sections which have been targeted for restrictions by the ATC is increasing. The Blood Mtn area of Georgia and the Watauga Lake area of Tennessee, along with several other shelters south of Daleville, Virginia are just a few.

Those who are familiar with my journal know that I'm one of those hikers who just abhors after-cooking cleanup chores. Therefore, I've resorted for some years now to the simple freezer bag method for meal preparation. Using quart sized ziplock freezer bags, all you need do is add boiling water to the enclosed ingredients, stir, close it up and let it sit for about ten minutes, and walla-- you've a hot, tasty meal you eat right out of the bag and best of all -- no cleanup!I normally just go with whatever I can find in stores along the way for these meals. Occasionally I may throw in a Mountain House meal for convenience and variety. But never have I been tempted to make the effort of trying to prepare bagged up meals at home to be shipped and eaten on the trail. I know a lot of hikers go this route but I just never wanted to be bothered with lots of drop boxes and Post Office visits. However, in my rambling around on various Hiker support web sites, I just discovered one posting which may stir me to risk the bother. A woman named Monica posts her recipes for cook-in-the-bag hiker-meals-on-the-go which look great and promise to be savory on the trail. Best as I can determine, you can find her posting at www.theyummylife.com >Instant_Meals and she gives the ingredients, recipes, and all bagging instructions for six meals such as Chicken CousCous, Thai Peanut Noodles, Creamy Alfredo Noodles, Chicken Fiesta Rice, etc. It looks good. Check it out!Well, it's getting close to Christmas. I think this is the first Christmas in a good number of years where I've not been expecting something in the Hiker gear genre from some member of the family (or from myself).   But really I'm quite satisfied with most every item I already have. Everything still works well. By a year from now I'm sure I'll want to replace a few items of clothing and get a new pair of shoes. But for now I'm set. But Merry Christmas to all of you.

Lots of Christmas traffic along the way. Can't express the joy I felt when we were finally able to turn off of the Interstates and major highways to begin winding our way up into our hills. It was dark when we arrived. It usually is. But we settled in quickly and hit the sack, the Mrs and I. And early this morning -- oh the wonder of waking up and lying there in the bed peering out the huge bedroom windows at the fog-enshrouded woods. Then to grab a cup of coffee and stand out on the deck to watch the day dawn and the fog to settle in the valleys (I call them Fog Lakes) before beginning to rise up the ridges. Truly a glorious sight! Got a lot to do in the few days afforded us on this trip. But today is all about reuniting with my Mountains. Hope to hit the local REI store while here this week to look for that pot-Lifter I've inquired about in a recent forum thread. Also looking for a pair or two of injinji sock liners.   Pretty much have whatever else I need. Have spoken with my hiking friend, GORP, concerning his desire to organize a group shake-down hike for 2018ers. Sounds like fun. Am sure that a few who are still in the trying out phase of their gear selection will profit from such an excursion. Am reminded of such a group back in 2013 who got together for a similar pre-hike outing. I don't believe any of the participants actually completed the trail that year. But hopefully this group of 2018 hopefuls will do better. On a personal note, the big news is that I've rejoined my local fitness center and am back to logging in some significant time on the stair climber.

But you got to remember the context. We don't see much of the white stuff down here in the Deep South (Mississippi). So you'll just have to take that into account when I tell you that the headline in next weeks local paper may well speak of the Blizzard of 2017 as it speaks of today's wintry mix (mostly sleet).   It's beautiful anyway and gives us an excuse to sit indoors near the heater and chat derisively about crazy people who risk life and limb getting out on the roads among a population replete with folk who hardly know what to do on dry surfaces and drive like imbeciles on slick surfaces. The bet is on that this evenings total of roadway mishaps will be sizeable. The Mrs has a large pot of homemade soup cooking over on the counter in the kitchen. I've been smelling it all day.

It's making me rethink my notion to go stoveless in 2018, especially in the early weeks. Today as I lazed around inside, I got to reading a bit of an old book -- Our Southern Highlander's by Horace Kephart for whom a mountain in the Smokies is named. Anyway, I was intrigued by his first chapter, ""Something Hidden; Go and Find It"". Got me to thinking of all to be found along the path in the southern section of the trail. Hidden things that often go unappreciated and uncovered. It begs the question: Why are we in such a hurry to rush northward? Why do we treat the lower company of gaps, ridges, balds and rhododendron-covered slopes only as early obstacles to be overcome as quickly as possible? Kephart wrote of one of his first forays into the southern Appalachians as feeling he was ""being an castaway in the sea of mountains"", of discovering a world where ""old ways die hard"". He spoke of hearing a local speak of the mountains as follows: ""Goin' up, you can might' nigh stand up straight and bite the ground; goin' down, a man wants hobnails in the seat of his pants.""Well, you won't find it quite that difficult. The mountains, to a large measure have been tamed. The trail has been graded for more civilized walking. But the hidden things remain. Let's keep that in mind and go out to find them.

What a wonderful end to a glorious day!Sunrises and sunsets are some of my favorite joys whenever I'm hiking. That's why this time around I plan to make every effort to place myself in the most optimum site to enjoy one or the other or both. Several early campsites come to mind. Setting up camp at Wolf Laurel Top (north of Neels Gap), for instance, might put one in just the right local to awaken to a beautiful sunrise. Other possibilities might include the top of Cheoah Bald, or Max Patch Bald. One of my favorites is the Overmountain Shelter north of Roan Mountain. I remember tenting there with that expansive open view oriented eastward. What a great place to lie there all snug in your bag with your tent fly open while you wait in wondrous expectation of the coming dawn.

Been giving it some thought. Don't want to over plan, but there are a few details I'd like to work out.For instance, I'm contemplating doing the Approach Trail up to Springer. It just may work out to be more convenient to be dropped off there. This would allow me to skip the services of the Hiker Hostel in Dahlonega. Didn't get any sleep there the last time due to the presence of a loud snorer in the room. It's just an option, but it would also avoid an expense. If this is my choice then I may back up my start date to the 19th.

I'm finding this nearly impossible to plan as there are so many unpredictables and unknowns. I may only be able to arrange my arrival in Franklin or the NOC to facilitate such a wish. I've friends who pastor churches in those areas. After that I'd just have to play it by ear. Just feel better when I can hit a church service occasionally. Finally, seeking to work out a list of contact names -- friends who live in towns up along the trail who might be interested in lending a helping hand to an injured hiker should that be needed, or just bless him with a hot homecooked meal. Anyway, Facebook contacts are proving to be helpful here. In all honesty, my main objective is to just see and visit with some of these folk if possible. So the list is being formed.

This prompted me to look again at my 2015 plan regarding mail drops. Then, I had reached the decision that if I did any mail drops at all it would be only a very few. This plan still seems valid as I look ahead to 2018. There remain a few places along the trail where resupply proves to be either difficult or very pricey. So sending a box ahead to those few locations seems prudent. Been discussing this with Force Flex. He and Curly Turtle are pondering the same issue. He put me onto a link which gave 5-6 places where a drop would be good to consider. Without even looking at the site I made out a list of my own and matched several of the first few towns mentioned in the link site. My first four were: 1: Top of Georgia Hostel at Dicks Creek Gap, 2: NOC in Wesser, and/or 3: Fontana Village, 4: Bland, VA, and 5: Harpers Ferry. It was uncanny that my selection matched those of the linked Hiker site. I consider the first one only so I may opt to skip going into Hiawassee. Having a box to pick up there in Dicks Crk Gap would enable me to just keep on hiking. I'd rather take a motel break when I get to Franklin. As for the NOC, the Outfitters has a limited supply that gets picked over pretty thoroughly during March. Besides that it's pricey. Same holds true for Fontana. Now one option I've considered would be to plan to reach Stecoah Gap and then hitch 6-8 miles into Robbinsville for motel/laundry and resupply. There's a big Ingles Supermarket there. Not a bad hitch. There isn't much in Bland and you've still several days before reaching Pearisburg. And it a mystery to me but Harpers Ferry has for years been a problem place for resupply.

More and more are now hitting the trail. Here are some of the things I'm picking up on. See if you discerned them as well. First, it's crowded out there on the trail, and we're still in February. Can only imagine what it will. E like in March. Darn that dumb movie! Perhaps it won't be so bad next year but my fear is the attraction will last quite a while. It's forcing me to really consider a plan put to me by Pheriel back in the Fall -- and that is to begin my hike in Davenport Gap, north of the Smokies, and stay well ahead of the initial crowds. It's a thought!Second, I've noticed that several hikers found dry water sources. I was afraid of that. The southern Appalachians have been dry for a few years now and it is affecting some of the springs we hikers have counted on. Don't get me wrong -- there is still water out there but it may force us to adjust our planned stops, carry more water in certain sections, or develop a love for dry camping. The third thing I'm seeing is the overall warmer temperatures. Now, don't you wacko environmentalists start crying 'global warming', please. It just means that we seem to be in a warming pattern here in the Southeast and our winters may remain rather mild in the immediate future. This being said, it may make it possible for more of us to begin our hikes earlier. I know that those who are out there right now may yet encounter some pretty cold days and nights before the get to Damascus, but it's looking as if their mid-February start hasn't turned out to be a bad decision. At least not so far. Personally, I don't do well in the cold and I hate toting all the extra gear and clothing that cold weather hiking seems to require.

Am slowly stepping up my routine. Still holding most of my daily outings to six miles with about 12- 15 lbs on my back. I'll wait until next January (the last two months prior to the hike) to don the full pack. As I have stated earlier, I don't want to overplan. So I'm really only mulling over a proposed schedule for the first two weeks. In 2015 I was glad the guys I was with and I chose to take the initial days fairly easily. I mean, we took four days to cover the first 31 miles to Neels Gap. That's almost snail-like. But it's best to break yourself in slowly. Georgia is tough! I still feel that 6-7 days to Dicks Creek Gap and 13-14 days to the NOC is a good estimate and a good start. So that's what I'll be thinking.

Oh how glorious!Haven't squeezed in any hiking while we've been here. A good portion of each day has been taken up with tending to needs around the place, making nearly daily trips to the local ACE Hardware store for supplies, and doing some tiding up out on the property. Over the winter a huge oak fell over on the slope right across a hiking path I'd had created through the woods. So I had to get up there and cut up some of the limbs to reopen a passable path. The spring had to be cleaned out as the heavy drop of autumn leaves had nearly smothered it. Then the ditch along the long winding road up to our hideaway had to be raked out so the spring rains won't wash out the road. So, needless to say, I've gotten plenty of exercise this past ten days.   We've had several nights of good rain which is so needed in this southern Appalachian area.

I've spoken to a few of them, wishing them well. Hope they don't get lost. I hear that the BMT isn't as well marked as our AT. I know they will have fun. Well, old Tom Turkey sounds like he's gone back over the ridgeline and it's time for me to get back to my coffee. Y'all take care!","Headed to the Mountains

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558289,We've had a great time back here in the mountains. We love our cabin and take such joy in the beauty around this place. Had a terrible storm last evening. I was so glad to be sleeping under a solid roof and not lying out in the storm separated by a mere sheet of nylon. Don't know how many inches of rain we had but it was heavy all night long and had flash flood warnings this morning. Anyway it's time to head back to Mississippi. The bluebirds nesting in our bench houses will have to carry on without us. Haven't heard from the group heading out to the BMT tomorrow. Looks as if they will encounter several days of rain next week. Hope they do well and the excursion will give they some insights into their gear selections.,"Breakfast on the Deck

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559984,"Really pleased with my training right now. Haven't really tried to increase mileage much, but stepping up my pace -- covering the six to eight miles more quickly. Now, I'm not really interested in the pace either, but can feel my legs becoming stronger and the quicker pace in helping my breathing as well. So it's all coming together. Today, as I was walking, I began trying to figure out where I might be on the trail next year at this time should I really begin on March 20. That would put me, barring any unforeseen mishaps, twenty-three days into my hike. By my calculations I could be through the Smokies and perhaps only a day shy of Hot Springs. Id feel pretty good about that. It would also mean that I would have been successful in keeping my mileage low (averaging eleven or twelve). I'm also mulling over a plan which would allow me to spend less nights in hostels and towns, at least in this initial period of time. But I'm really trying not to over think it.

The day before we had reached Deep Gap and among the huge crowd of trail angels we found there were the pastor and members of this congregation. They invited us three back to Franklin with them where they put us up in plush accommodations in their youth house next to the church.

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562796,Had the chance to visit my old campus -- Belhaven University in Jackson Mississippi today. Couldn't believe how it had changed. Hardly anything of the old campus still there except for a few of the original buildings. Truly a modern and beautiful campus. But the trip and the meeting of our Presbytery ate up most of the day. Therefore was able to get in only a few miles of walking over in the park. Then came home and put in another hour behind the mower. Worked up a good sweat though. Thinking about my start date next year. May have to delay my proposed start on the 20th a bit. We will see. Know there will be much to do once we move up to our cabin in the mountains. Also I will have to work out everything with Social Security to begin getting that payment coming in.

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563119,"Hard to imagine how quickly the weather can turn on you. Overnight a front moved across our area here in the Deep South bringing rain and significantly lower temps. Yesterday I walked under sunny skies sweating the miles out in temps close to 90.  Today the temperature never got above 60 and a stiff wind made it feel even colder -- not to mention the rain. I actually had to dig around in my hiking storage bin to relocate my cycling are sleeves and gloves that I had packed away thinking Summer had arrived in full force. I know that 60 degrees is a long away from freezing, but it shows you that the temps really don't have to drop very far to become uncomfortable. Reminds me on one time a number of years ago when I was out doing a section of the AT south of Wesser and the NOC. It was in March and, as you can imagine, I ran into a number of thru hikers along that stretch. By that time most of them were about nine to ten days into their hike. One night we were all sitting around ribbing one guy who had already shipped his sleeping bag back home in order to lighten his pack. The only thing he had to sleep in was one of those emergency blankets. It wasn't terribly cold -- down in the upper 40's, but he was miserable with his choice. I remember him curled up all night out by the fire pit, as close to the fire as he could get, shivering all night long. Wow!

Summer hasn't even arrived yet and already the midday temps are oppressive. All this means is that my daily training walks are turning into real sweat fests. I come home drenched and totally drained. I've also noticed a waning in my energy levels. After six or seven miles I seem to hit a wall that's hard to push through. I try to stay hydrated and have been using some Mio squeeze additive with the water. It's supposed to help with the Replacement of electrolytes. But I feel I need something stronger. I ran out of my NUUN tablets and may have to reorder. But then I learned that my son-in-law has taken to using the above product as he trains for an iron man competition. He feels these capsules which you swallow are a real help. So, before I order some I thought I'd ask my fellow hikers for their advice.

Of course it has pretty much felt like summer here in Mississippi since mid-March. Oh how it makes one long for the mountains and the shade of that long green tunnel. 
Really enjoyed reading of Force Flex and Curly Turtle's recent slog through the Shenandoah Park. Made my mouth water just reading of them sipping on those Blackberry Shakes. As you can see in the pic above, we're still a month away from any chance to harvest trailside blackberries here. But when the come in I'll have to concoct my own shake. 
Of course, another sign of summer is the proliferation of poison ivy (see above pic). Watch out where you step, out there, and even where you hang your bear bag. 
It was a rather wet walk today. Had to make use of my umbrella as well as my rain skirt. Got a few strange looks. Guess the good folk down here don't see a bearded guy out walking in a skirt too often. But I love my rain skirt!

And HOT!  I've been able to keep up my training routine but come in soaking wet and utterly drained. This has made our get-away back up to the mountains this past week so much more enjoyable. 
We've been here at our NC cabin for a week now and will remain until Thursday. It's been good to be back here at our mountain home.  Just tucking ourselves away here in the shade of our woods on the side of our mountain does wonders for our spirit. 
Of course, there is always a lot of work to do. The big project for this trip involves a paint brush. Am trying to apply a fresh coat to as much of the exterior as I can reach from the ground. Then perhaps in October I can do some of the ladder work. Fun, fun!
Some bad news is that I injured my left wrist yesterday (doing something stupid).  Don't yet know what damage has been done. Just felt (and heard) a pop followed by pain. I've been icing it and have a brace on it. Am taking ibuprofen and may get an x-ray if it continues to hurt. At least it's not my eating hand!

Had wonderful weather and actually got a good bit of work done around the place. Got started with the enormous project of painting the exterior. Don't know how I'm going to get to the second story level and gable eaves. Lord, give me strength!Was able to do a little work on our spring which flows out from under a huge boulder back in the woods. I was actually quite pleased to see such a good flow of water at this time in the heat of summer. Perhaps a sign that the drought we've been having here in the southeast may be coming to an end. Anyway, the water was good to see and quite cool. I've filtered water from smaller pools on the AT many times. Oh, and let's not forget my excursion to the local REI store in nearby Fletcher.

What a wonderful example of dogged perseverance stretched over many hiking seasons. I suppose there are hundreds who have sought to do the same and somewhere along the way lost focus or reached a point where they just couldn't keep going back out there to bite off another chunk. But Steamer hung in there. Seems every time I turned around and tuned into TJ I'd discover that he was back out on the trail, perhaps in Virginia or up along some rocky stretch of Pennsylvania. Anyway, I can't be more happy for him and rejoice that this long-standing goal has been achieved. Congrats Steamer!Now, as for an update on my own plans -- I'm still seeing a green light ahead on my intentions to give a thruhike one more try in 2018. I still hope to start the week of March 20. I'll wait till closer to set the exact date. I'm looking forward to the possibility of ""Special Ed"" joining up with me for a long section. Hiked a few days with him in 2015 and enjoyed his company. He's thinking of meeting me at Deep Gap, fifteen miles north of Dicks Creek Gap, and pacing me all the way to Damascus. Hope it works out. My training is going well. I'm slogging out the miles down here in the Mississippi heat and humidity. Legs feel good. Losing weight. I've dropped twenty lbs since May. Still giving serious thought to going stoveless on this trip, but may start out with a stove for the first few weeks and then drop it. We'll see.

Although, with all the recent events (two devastating hurricanes) and today's 9-11 remembrance, musing over a walk in the woods six months from now seems quite inappropriate. But time moves on, plans must be formulated, and dreams are hard to put on hold. 
With the arrival of September it appears that we may be through with the oppressive heat and humidity here in the Deep South for yet another year. My training walks this past week have been nothing short of spectacular. With the cooler temps and a nice crisp breeze there has been a distinctive spring in my step and the miles have flown by. I'm hoping this bodes well for the Spring start I'm planning. 
Took some nice photos of knotholes today. Found one tree which evidently has its own peculiar thirst as a can of Monster was tucked away in one of its crevasses. The Scuppernong vines are almost empty now along my path. I guess the possums and raccoons and I have stripped them clean. But the persimmons are ripening nicely. Yum!  I just love these trailside snacks!
No real changes to announce in my plans or gear selection. Still looking into a new rain jacket but haven't made my choice yet.

We had such a great time on that beautiful Fall day. The air was crisp; the sun was full strength and offered just enough warmth to keep us comfortable; and the dry leaves on the ground entertained with the constant rustling. I hope she remembers it too. Took a major step forward toward making my 2018 plans come together -- announced my retirement this week, effective the last week in December. Then the Mrs and I can relocate up to our cabin in the North Carolina mountains and we'll have a couple of months to get settled in before I hit the trail mid-March.

On Tuesday, one of our neighbors there on the mountain called to inform us that a huge oak had fallen down across our driveway blocking entry. Furthermore, the tree crashed down on the roof of our outbuilding/toolshed creating a gaping hole.So, we were put into scramble mode and began calling and messaging folk who might know who we could get to help us quickly in this crisis. Long story short, we were enabled to get two separate men up to the cabin yesterday. One man (and his crew) cut up the tree and cleared the drive so we can get in next week. And the second man, a carpenter, got by there to survey the damage, put a tarp over the hole (which can be seen in the photo) and agreed to get back on Saturday to effect the repairs.

But the cabin was spared. Last evening, Halloween, just after getting into bed, I heard a noise like something flying around in the room. Turned the light back on to discover a bat soaring back and forth in the cathedral ceiling area of the bedroom.

Don’t really want to do that, so I may look into shuttle options in the area. The big issue at present is an injured back — the aftermath of our move here to the mountains.

Discovered some conflicting data concerning the Hiker Hostel in Suches, GA. I stayed there back in 2015 along with Icefire and several others. It wasn’t anything great, but was warm and serviceable, located over a country store where plenty of food options were available. Wondering about it’s current condition, I put in a call and was fortunate enough to speak with one of the new owners. Seems the establishment was closed down for a time and is now under new management. I was assured the Hostel will be open and operational come mid-February. It may operate under a different name as from this 2016 photo. Anyway, having a reasonably priced hostel available from Gooch Gap or Woody Gap may prove handy.

One of the things that gets to me when backpacking is my spine seems to compact. Also, after days of walking along with my head lowered, looking at the ground, all the rocks and roots to step over, my neck really begins to feel as if it’s on fire. Anyway, my Chiropractor showed me how to use this noodle, placing it under my neck or along side of my spine to realign things and loosen up tight shoulder muscles. It’s wonderful!

There were a couple men already trout fishing up at the large pool at the base of the Falls. Speaking of the Falls, man alive am I glad that I’ve opted NOT to hike the approach trail up to Springer as it begins right off with the scaling of the 604 steps that wind their way up beside the waterfall (739 feet) — and that’s just the beginning of the eight miles before you on the way up to Springer Mountain.

Didn’t take me long to catch up with Sage (NOBO from Texas) and we hiked together the rest of the day. We had thought we’d go further than Hawk Mtn Shelter but around 1 pm the skies opened and we were caught in a storm. The rain was bad enough but the hail got us both thinking about seeking refuge. Anyway we arrived at Hawk Shelter at 2 pm and as there was space for two more wet hikers inside we decided to stop. I’m into dry clothes and resting on top of my bag.

Today, day two, I set out to reach Woody Gap. We had heard that a winter storm was to hit tonight and drop several inches of snow. Anyway the more I thought about it, the idea of reaching Woody and hitching two miles west to Suches to get a shower and stay in a warm hostel seemed like a grand idea. So here I am. 
It was a hard twelve miles today with several tough climbs. My wet clothes from yesterday dried out on my body but hiking in wet socks today was a big mistake. My feet are covered with blisters I’ll have to work on just as soon as I eat the pizza that just been delivered to me.","

So thankful to the Lord for this place of refuge and for giving me the strength yesterday to reach it. The winter blast which has hit us tonight is forcing a decision on me. Ahead of me today on the trail is Blood Mountain with its exposed granite top and steep descent. In 2013 I suffered a hike-ending knee injury on this descent, so I’m aware how treacherous it can be. But today Blood Mountain will be covered in ice and snow making its ascent and descent very dangerous indeed. So, several of us here at the Hostel have decided it best to skip over this ten mile stretch and get a shuttle to Neels Gap. Reaching Neels later on this morning I will have another decision to make — take a zero rest day there and let my blisters heal a bit or go ahead and hike out.

First let me say a word about Day Three — after spending the night in the Hostel in Suches to escape the winter storm, we woke to snow, sub freezing temps and high wind. So we decided not to risk summiting Blood Mountain lest we spill some of our own. So we shuttled over to Neels Gap and rented a cabin to take a zero day (no miles) and rest up. We sat around watching it snow all day, ate pizza, and watched TV. 
Now for Day Four:
I left the cabin at 8:20. The sun was breaking and we were told the temps were to climb into the lower forties. It remained frigid all day. Bitter cold wind. This was one of the worst days I’ve ever had on the AT. It was brutal. But the Good Lord was with me. Much of the trail this morning was covered in snow and ice. Treacherous walking the downhill parts. Crunchy walking the rest of the time. There were two men set up in Tesnatee Gap with hot chocolate for us. That was great. Thanks! The climb out of that gap is steep and the cold air made it difficult to breathe. But God gave me strength. Sometime around 1 pm I found a sunny spot on the sheltered side of a ridge and sat down for a bite. I made it into Low Gap Shelter at 3:00 and quickly set up my tent. The wind is howling and the temps are to drop down tonight below the rating on my bag. But it is what it is.","

Anyway, was up and packed and on the trail by 8:20. The sun was just beginning to make its appearance into the gap. I hoped this was a sign of good improvements but while we had sunshine all morning it gave very little warmth and the wind kept the chill factor low. 
Made good time walking simply because it was too cold to stop. Made it to Blue Mountain Shelter by 12:30 and dropped down the 1,000’ into Unicom Gap by 1:15. With rain threatening and feeling the oncoming of a cold, I decided to hitch a ride into Hiawassee to see if I can get meds for my Head, throat, and blistered feet. 
The real problem for me now is my scheduled rendezvous on Tuesday with my hiking buddy, Special Ed. If I opt to sit out the cold rain tonight and tomorrow here in Hiawassee, I’ll have to skip over another section of the trail (16 miles) so as not to mess up the schedule. I’ll see how things go tonight. 
This footpath is every bit as rough and demanding as I remember. My feet and my ego have been sorely bruised. But I am thankful to the Lord for this opportunity and these minor interruptions to my plans here at the start are nothing in the long scheme of things. I met an older man yesterday who was on the trail again thirty years after his own thruhike. His advice was to take what the trail gives you. Be flexible. Don’t push to keep to a schedule.

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584800,"FIRST DAYS’ REFLECTIONS
As I sit here in Hiawassee, nursing my sore feet and waiting out the tail end of the colder weather, about all I have to do to occupy myself is to reflect on some of what I’ve seen and experienced in my first days on the trail. 
The weather, of course, has been deplorable, but enough said about that. The best part has been the people I’ve met. Old and young, from all over the world and all parts of the USA. The cultural and gender and age diversity has given to many interesting conversations. 
Then there’s the trail itself. I hiked these same miles back in 2015 with GORP, Icefire, and Special Ed. I have been amazed at times how little of the path I accurately remember. But then when you’re walking along with your head down, staring at every rock and root in front of you, it’s easy to miss much of what lies on either side of that slender strip of trodden dirt. It was interesting to see the new relo around Justus Mountain instead of up and over it as earlier. Much nicer!  Several of the early shelters (Hawk and Gooch, for instance) have large roped off sections around them where tenting is forbidden. Supposedly this is to allow the ground to recover from overuse. Sure makes it difficult for hikers at times. 
Have been very appreciative of several folk out along the trail doing trail magic. Their kindness has been a real blessing. 
With all the rain and snow, the trail, in many places, is a churned up mess. At times you find yourself doing more slipping and sliding down inclines than stepping. Icefire and I used to speak of this as ‘mud skiing’ — an Extreme Sport not for the faint of heart. 
On a personal note, my gear has served me well these early days. I’m loving my light weight umbrella and am sure to put it to good use in the weeks to come. I think we are to have rain for five of the next seven days. 
Food: I never cease to be amazed how the food selections you made in the grocery store back home can become so unappealing after just a few days on the trail. I feel sorry for the folk who choose to purchase and box up six months of meals before setting one step onto the trail. There’s a reason why mountains of oatmeal packets keep showing up at every hostel’s give away Hiker box. Discouragement: I’m also amazed just how quickly and easily thoughts of quitting come creeping into your mind.  That’s why having friends who drop you well wishes and let you know they are keeping you in their prayers — that’s why it’s so important.  I put in a call yesterday to my buddy Force Flex, who will be out here in just a couple of weeks with his bride, Curly.  FF was able to encourage me and it was much needed. Thanks.
Well, enough rambling. This trail is hard and beautiful and frustrating and, at times, even a bit scary. But I’m thankful for the chance to experience it again.","

My last day to nurse my feet and wait out the cold and wet. I’m such a terrible hiker. But the feet are feeling much better and the next couple of days promise to be mostly rain free. So, I hope to hike out tomorrow and meet up with my friend, Special Ed, on Tuesday about 15 miles north. 
Picked up a resupply box today at the Top of Georgia Hostel. Now I’ve got to sort through it and pare down what I want to pack out. I’ll need five days of food to get me to the NOC in Wesser. My appetite really hasn’t kicked in yet and l shipped too much food from home. So many items will end up in the ‘Hiker box’ in the commons room. Some other Hiker may need it.

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585040,"As you can see by the photo, I made it out of Georgia and crossed over into North Carolina. Actually that was yesterday. I left out of Dicks Creek Gap about 8:30 yesterday morning. I played leapfrog with several hikers for most of the day. We never saw the sun and suffered through strong cold wind all day. Found a somewhat sheltered spot around 11:00 and sat down for fifteen minutes. That was the only rest I got all day. 
Since I’ve hiked this section before I was aware of what lay ahead. North Carolina really welcomes hikers in a big way — one of the toughest climbs to date. It’s a real heart thumper, nearly straight up. I won’t say you could kiss the ground ahead of you without bending down but it was almost that bad. 
Needless to say, when I got to Muskrat Shelter around 3:00 pm I was exhausted. It was cold and rain was threatening, so I quickly filtered some water from the stream, cooked some dinner, set up my tent and crawled in. 
As I was lying there shivering, I remembered I had a couple of those hand warmers. I opened them and tucked them down in my shorts right over the femoral artery. That did the trick. In twenty minutes I was warm all over. 
It rained off and on all night. I coughed all night. So this morning I packed up everything that was with me inside the tent, and then got outside to wipe off as much moisture as possible, before stowing away my still wet (therefore heavy) tent. After that I hustled up the trail to meet my buddy Ed in Deep Gap (4 miles). I made it there in about two hours. But as I approached I became convinced that I couldn’t go on in this wet, rainy, cold. Since it looked as if more of the same was the flavor of the next two days, I’m taking shelter in Franklin and will resume hiking on Thursday. Hoping warmth and Spring will get here soon.

We all scrunched up closer to make room for him on the shelter floor. Not much rest all night. Felt squished and couldn’t turn over without elbowing whoever was sleeping along side. Miserable. 
Then this morning, Ed and I hiked 5.9 down off of Siler Bald and then climbed nearly 1,000’ up to the top of Wayah Bald. We were walking as in the midst of a cloud the whole morning. Cold, windy and wet!
When I got to the top there were some nice folk there from Franklin handing out McDonald’s Cheeseburgers. It was heavenly. But I made the decision to get off trail for a few weeks to wait for Spring actually to arrive. So I’m headed home for a bit. Hope to be back out there.","Siler Bald Shelter

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585355,"Had the chance to say goodbye to a number of my hiking friends this morning as the shuttle came around from the First Baptist Church here in Franklin and took us to their facilities where we were served pancakes and bacon to our heart’ content. FBC of Franklin has been reaching out to and serving the Hiker community with this free, all you can eat breakfast since 2008. Banners decorated the fellowship hall where hikers of the class of each year have signed their trail names. It’s a great ministry and the pastor gave a wonderful two minute Easter devotional. Hard to leave my hiking family for a time but I’m sure I will see some of them again, especially if I end up skipping the Smokies for the time being. That will allow me to eliminate a week that will have separated us. Looking forward to being able to join my wife and church family for Easter Worship tomorrow. I’ll try to keep everyone abreast of my plans and when I hop back onto trail.","

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585564,"Enjoying being back at home for a while. Was able to worship yesterday, Easter Sunday, with my wife at our church. What a joy!
Another perk is that I’ll be able to visit with my daughter and two g’daughters as they drive up today from Louisiana. That’ll be fun!
And then there’s the fact that this is Masters Week - PGA golf in Augusta — the greatest tournament at the most beautiful venue in the world. So I’m looking forward to being a spectator of this fun event while I sit here waiting for Spring finally to arrive in the higher elevations. 
My tentative plan calls for remaining off-Trail for two weeks, returning to the AT sometime the week of April 17th. Perhaps by then the mountain temps will have mellowed out a bit more and the nighttime temps will remain consistently out of the 30’s. One can hope. 
Even then I may decide to skip over the Smokies and resume my northbound trek just past Davenport Gap. Living nearby, it makes it relatively easy for me to drop back later and fill in any gaps I leave undone for the present. I’ve also decided to return to the trail with a renewed commitment to hike a more leisurely pace (at least through Damascus) and to try and enjoy the trail rather than let the miles or my fellow hiking community determine my daily goals. I’ll be keeping tabs with as many of the hikers I’ve already met as well as those who are approaching from behind. May they too have safe and enjoyable hikes.","

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586260,"It’s been nice to be back home for a while. Got to visit with my daughter and granddaughters last week. That was a nice treat. It’s also been nice to get back to my church. I’ve missed my church family. And, of course, I’ve enjoyed being home with the Mrs. being parted from each other is one of the most difficult of the trials associated with this long trek. While Home I’ve been keeping my eye on the weather forecasts as well as reading the journals of other hikers who have continued to suffer through the remnants of winter. All in all I feel real good about my decision to get off and wait for warmer temps. The frozen water bottles and frozen boots of those who have chosen to slog through the Smokies is no part of my idea of fun. For this reason I’ve decided to skip over the Smokies for now and deal with those seventy miles at another more pleasant time. From the picture you can see that the temps for next week over the section of the trail leading into Hot Springs looks good. So I hope to resume my walk on Monday or Tuesday at the I-40 crossing just north of Davenport Gap and work my way northward from there. Not sure how I’ll get there right now. May have to hitch. But looking forward to getting back to the trail. After being off two weeks and skipping such a large section, I may well plop back down in the company of some of the hikers I was walking with before. It’ll be good to see them again.","
",Looking To Jump Back On the Trail,"Apr 09, Mon",0
Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595311,"Well, it’s been a while since I updated. Frankly, I was so discouraged back in April when I came off the trail that I had no idea that I’d be adding anything further to my journal this year. My early weeks on the trail this go around were so unbearable, ending with my tumble and slight injury, that I was ready to hang up the hiking shoes for good. 
But time heals things and slowly the hip injury has improved. I’ve gotten back to some walking lately and today I was able to get in 8.5 hilly miles with my pack on in just under three hours. So, it would seem that I’m on the mend. 
And there certainly remains a lot of hiking time left in this 2018 season. So I’ve begun to think about getting back out to do a section. Thinking about jumping on the Amtrak train out of Greenville, SC and riding up to Washington DC. From there I can take another train to Harpers Ferry, WV. From there I could hike south (SOBO) through Virginia. Could go as far as Daleville or all the way back to Damascus if all were to go well. 
Would make it more enjoyable if I had someone to hike along with. So, anyone out there interested?  Drop me a line. Know it will be hot and since it has been a couple of months since I was hiking, I plan to take it slow at start and get my legs under me again. Just keep thinking of all those waysides in the Shenandoah and blackberry milkshakes!","

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596243,"As the weeks in this 2018 hiking season continue to slip by and I’ve still not made it back out, I’ve begun to rethink things and lay the groundwork for a more successful outing (hopefully) in 2019. To that end I’ve launched a 2019 journal here on TJ. I’d still like to get back out there on the trail for an extended section this summer but a number of things are putting such in doubt. Tomorrow the Mrs and I celebrate out 44th Anniversary. That’s worth being Home for!  Then we’ve some activities coming up at our church (such as VBS) which I’d hate to miss. Also, July is ‘Christmas in July’ at our church where the Operation Christmas Child Shoebox ministry is emphasized — and I’m involved in that. On top of those things, 2018 continues to set records for wetness here in the Appalachians, making it difficult to get out with consistency for the hiking I have needed to rehab my hip. So, I may do well just to give up on 2018 and begin to look to 2019. I’ve plenty of time to plot it out, but I’m thinking of a plan to avoid some of the problems I met with this year. I’ll probably look to start my hike from Damascus, Virginia. This will let me start later (avoiding much of the cold) and will put me out in front of the huge hiker bubble which one encounters down in Georgia in March. Anyway, it’s a time to begin pondering my options.","
