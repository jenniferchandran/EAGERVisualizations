My plan is to through-hike the AT!  I will start on March 12 at Springer Mountain, and my brother will be joining me for the first week.  Starting in Georgia should be good since I'll have my family there to support me.

I've quit my job and bought my plane ticket, so this is very real!!",,View Entry,"Jan 29, Mon",0

Yesterday was my last day at my job.  Things went well, people were nice about me leaving.Not quite sure how I'll use this trail journal, but it will be good to have whether it ends up being daily, weekly, or monthly.  Played with putting in a photo from my GPS on the first entry, and it's a bit clunky but did work.  Next test is to try any of this from a phone since they don't seem to have an app.  Worst case I email entries back.2 more weeks in CA, then headed to GA for final preparations.  One more big hike planned in Ventana Wilderness outside Big Sur for a couple nights, but otherwise I'm feeling very good training wise and preparation wise.For those who may not know me, I am a 33 year old engineer who lives in San Francisco and has worked at startups my whole career.  I decided it was time to take a break, and what better way to use my time than on the AT.  I'm an avid backpacker in the California backcountry, but I've never done anything near this long or big before.  I grew up in Atlanta, so I've Springer Mountain and Blood Mountain with my Boy Scout troop, so I'd like to think I have some idea how the terrain starts out.  Beyond that, it's been a lot of research, and a ton of questions to one very helpful thru hiker who came before.I'm looking forward to my adventure - I hope you enjoy reading about it!","

Stretch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583815,"T-Minus 3 days....  I’m so pumped!!I’ve been in Georgia this week preparing.  Went to Amicalola Falls State Park and got my hang-tang from registration.  I’m #680 out of 4,000 registered hikers.  Hopefully that means I’m a bit ahead of the bubble, but it also means marching into cold and very likely snow next week.  My brother is with me for the first week, and we’re ready for whatever weather the mountains throw at us.  We’re only planning to hit Neel’s Gap (31.1) Miles in 5/6 days, so the slow start should help me ease in and train. Preparation is going well.  I’ve stocked up a ton of food for the start and drops.  I’ve been through a few cycles of losing and finding things, so I think I have everything here and no last-minute gear needs.  I had 2 days of indigestion which I think was my body resetting while it knew it could, and also getting used to greasy southern food, which is necessary.I’m ready.  This is it.  Next entry should be from the trail!",,"Woodstock, GA","Mar 09, Fri",0

Stretch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584588,"On Saturday night, I had my first experience with ""Trail Magic"" (strangers helping hikers, usually with food or water) on Saturday night, and then had it in droves this week. I’m sitting at the picnic tables enjoying a peaceful view, when all of the sudden a massive group of locals shows up and starts putting down trays of food everywhere.  I start talking to one of them because I offered to get out of the way of their picnic - he laughed and said “this is your picnic, son” and proceeded to tell me that the local church groups all even have a schedule for when they show up to feed the hikers.  I came back later and was greeted with a plate, quickly remembered I was in the south so couldn’t/wouldn’t eat any of the hot food (burger and baconed beans not vege, coleslaw and egg salad not Ryan), but then got to the section of hiker foods they were just giving away/pushing - I took 5 food bars, then they gave me a look and said “please do stock up, we’ve got more of everything”, so I ended up with about 10+ bars (keep in mind I would need to eat 15-20 bars per day to keep up calories, and these things cost $2-3 a pop). That is all to say they were very generous with the food they brought.  So, I have my food, turn around, and realize that none of the thru-hikers are really sticking around to mingle.  I thought that was rather rude, so I made a point of sitting down in a group of locals and started talking to an older woman.  Suddenly, I had 4 locals listening to me raptly, and I wasn’t even really telling any interesting parts of my story - just that I grew up in Atlanta and life in SF and work in tech now.  They told me all about Hiawassee and the part across the NC border where a lot of them live.  They were all just so nice and genuine people, I’m 100% convinced if I had told any of them I was coming through Hiawassee they would have offered me a ride from the trail and invited me into their homes.  We had a very pleasant conversation and they basically told me at the end “you should come back to the south!  We don’t need all our smartest kids moving west”. I excused myself and one man made a point of saying “thank you so much for sitting and talking with us”. “Of course, it’s the least I could do”.So, as far as the trail on Sunday.  Pretty easy first day solo.  Things are definitely thinning out after Neel Gap - people slowing down, spring breakers going home, less day hike opportunity/interest later in the trail.  I did over 10 miles, but then came into camp completely wiped.  I was a bit shell-shocked honestly, until I sat down at the campfire and starting hearing the other stories.  For perspective, my only real injury has been 1 small blister that formed from wearing the wrong socks one day, and it has now turned into a callous after nursing.  Everything beyond that is just a bit ache-y, nothing specific.  Knowing that now, let me tell you what injuries the other hikers I have met have already endured within the first 30-70 miles:Blister ""over my entire heels""Shin splints so bad to knock someone of the trail for 3-4 days, if not permanentlyFractured heel2 fractured heelsTwisted ankleAn unknown injury that forced a rescue extraction for 3 folks very near where I had camped the night before.  Weather has gotten brutal - more on that in later entries.The trail provides (e.g. trail angels and trail magic above), but it is also brutal.  It's ripping through bodies and gear.  All of these things I had heard, but it's a very different thing to realize someone you know and has been hiking with has one of these injuries.  I have been safe from major injury so far, but it's all really only one step away - every step you take with this much weight could be the one that slips and takes you down.  Especially with the weather, it has been very technical hiking work, and I have been very careful.","Mountain Crossings Hostel

Stretch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584591,"So... this is when things have started to get very rough and real on the trail.  The weather has been continually getting worse this week, a real risk of starting this early.  2 nights of sleeping in the rain in a row, with no sunshine the day in between to dry anything out, meaning damp, nasty gear.Now, the one plus side of this, that honestly most of my fellow thru's haven't come to appreciate yet, is that today's 10 miles took about 1/4 the energy of the previous day since the sun wasn't beating down on us draining energy.  Frankly, hiking through a light rain is the best possible condition to hike - you are being cooled by the rain drops, and the trail is being softened for you.  Now, this can be one bad change from pouring rain and muddy trails, both of which suck.  I, luckily, pitched my rainfly for that portion of the day and missed it :)  That was an experience where I learned to just do my own trail, since others were saying ""you're crazy, we're pushing to the shelter 2 miles away"" meaning they trudged through mud for an hour rather than staying dry like me.So, the nastiness.  For perspective, I'm writing this and the next entry from a warm hotel, so don't worry about me, but I would like to share what I've been through.For perspective, this is the CNN article about the weather we slept through Monday night:https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/20/us/tornadoes-storms-noreaster-severe-weather/index.htmlMost hikers were bailing to town, but I was more worried about the snow Tuesday than one more night of rain, so I stayed.  I camped at a small site with a gentleman from Holland and 2 locals.  The local's wife called him and was basically begging him to let her pick him up after the news reports, but we were all determined to stay.   I'll spare you the brutal details of the night and wind, but I will say that I started hiking at 6AM the next day to get the heck out of everything.  More on that in the next entry.","Low Gap Shelter

Stretch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584592,"16 miles. 4K ascent, 5K descent.  Rain, wind, sun, hail.This day was truly my biggest test.  I knew I had to go 16 miles to get to the next good place for a shuttle.  This is far beyond what I had hoped to do at this point, but I knew I would be in a hotel that night, so I just kept pushing.  Started at 6AM, 45 minutes of headlamp hiking.  3 separate sections today of having a full 3 hours without seeing another soul, which felt really good compared to the previous crowds.  The photo is of the sunrise, which was so satisfying to see 2 days after it disappeared, and FINALLY dry out some gear.  During one of the solo sections on a higher peak, hail started coming down.  While this was a bit terrifying to be alone in (and also validated my decision not to camp out if this was the weather at 2:30PM), it actually ended up being an incredibly serene and freeing experience.  I think it slowed people down, because I didn't see anyone for a while, and I just got to be alone in the chilly woods without getting wet.  Perfect hiking weather actually :)  The hail continued for ~2 hours, and then things cleared up.  After that, I knew I could make it to the end.So satisfying to be in a hotel, soak in a hot tub, and chill out.  Waking up at 3AM sore made me decide to do a zero day, which I'm glad I did because the snow is supposed to get worse tonight.","Unicoi Gap

Stretch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585500,"First, some background on trail names.  It is customary to adopt a name for the trail that is given to you by fellow hikers based on some incident or trait.  I didn't fully understand this until coming on the trail and realizing how much easier it is to learn a distinct name with a story rather than all the real names of the tons of new people you are meeting.  Some examples of trail names I have come across - roadkill, sturdy gurdy, yogi, sidetrack, trail mom, toasty nuts, spider, caveman, hurley, and those are the ones clean enough to share.For a while, I was just going by the name ""Trail Ryan"", who I would explain is much more laid back than regular Ryan.  This name even became famous when I left my hat with a group that put it on a fence at a gap for me to find with a note reading ""do not steal me, I belong to Trail Ryan"".  A couple people I saw later who I didn't know would say ""that hat!  you must be Trail Ryan...""  This name worked for the first couple weeks.So, my real trail name has become ""Stretch"", as in Stretch Armstrong.  I was standing around with some friends I had made earlier in the trail and then run back into, when I started contorting my arms as I do sometimes.  When they noticed, I showed them my double-jointed trick where I can clasp my arms behind my body then bring them all the way over my head.  And thus, Stretch Armstrong was born, based on the early-90s toy commercials.  It's a good trail name, and it reminds me to stretch more as well :)Did a good bit of mileage today, and my knees started hurting for the first time.  There is really no flat at all, it's all up or down of some sort, banging on your body.  Good to meet back up with Caveman and Becca, and liking the rest of the crowd around this timing as well.","Wine Spring Campground

Very eventful night at the shelter site, making me glad I was in a tent.  We heard owls hooting for most of the night, then late in the night we started to hear a few random coyote howls over the ridge.  As they got closer, at ~6AM an hour before any sunlight, the owls hooting stopped, and then all of the sudden there was a massive commotion right outside the shelter in an open area ~25 feet from my tent.  I don't think the coyotes ever actually made it down to the shelter, but the noise was a pack of wild dogs rolling in to defend their territory from the coyotes and they started running in circles and barking wildly.  Not having any light, it was pretty terrifying, and the people in the shelter were spooked.  In the light of day, it was 3 dogs, led by a huge pitbull.  They were actually pretty friendly and followed one hiker into town...","Sassafras Gap Shelter

Went to the lunch buffet, and it was amazing.  So much mac&cheese and mashed potatoes.  Buffets are pretty great on 0 days since you don't have to hike with that on your stomach, it's just catching up on calories and you don't feel guilty completely filling your stomach for once.

Stretch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588895,"It was a brutal and scary day to say the least.  After waking up and checking on John and the dog, it was really clear that we needed to get them out of the woods.  The best option was hiking 6 miles backwards to a gap and trying to hitch a ride from there to his car.  This was back over 3 knobs, which meant hills and sun on our way back.  I left my pack near the shelter, and then I carried John's pack while he looked after the dog.  He contrived a sling out of his sleeping back to carry the dog, which would work ok for 1/4 to 1/2 mile at a time, then the dog would squirm out and run on his own for a 1/2 mile.  This was an OK pace (if heavy on John's back) for a while and seemed to work.  However, I really began to understand how bad things were when we were 1-2 miles from the gap and John went to put the dog down.  Instead of running ahead, the dog didn't move at all and just laid down directly on the trail.  Not a good sign....
We got the dog to the gap, and luckily we found a ride to the other gap immediately.  They got out, which felt great.  I had seen many friends hiking the wrong direction who were puzzled ""Stretch - Katahdin is the other direction!""  I then had the daunting task of hiking back into the woods without my pack (first time on the trail like this), which initially felt good to be hauling mileage, but then I ended up getting well over a mile off trail since I was going so fast.  So I wasted another couple hours getting lost on an already intense day.  I finally got back to my bag at ~5PM, and I was determined to make some forward progress that day, so I did one more hill and 2 more miles and found a place to camp.  Joined a fire with some very discouraging section hikers from Maryland - ""it's so cute to meet hikers like you just starting!"" ""Uh.... I'm hundreds of miles and over a month in""  ""yeah... but.... you really just started!!!""
Frankly, this whole experience was very eye-opening for me.  Firstly, the most important thing is that my friend and his dog are healthy and at home.  I would have done everything in my power to facilitate that, seriously considering contacting emergency extraction at some points.  I'd like to think that weather, not my planning, caused this incident, but I have to realistically look now at how I plan visitors on the trail and make sure I'm not pushing anyone (or any animals) harder than they can go.  John is a marathon runner who was blowing us hikers out of the water climbing the mountain, so I kept thinking everything was OK, but I should have paid more attention to the dog.  I have learned from this, and will be trying to set more realistic expectations for visitors.  Please remember when you read this that I've been training months/years for this experience, and that even after that it's taken me more than month on the trail to get up to 15-20 mile days.  Thru-hiking is absolutely a sport (more on that in another entry), and it's life-or-death out here with every step, campsite choice, and water filtration.  I do hope people are inspired by this journal to go hike and exercise, but PLEASE do it in a healthy, responsible way!","

-I was at mile 640, now at 1,065.  I’m in Maryland about to cross into Pennsylvania.
-I had not actually seen a bear at my last entry, I’ve literally now seen 11 bears, including a mama bear who roared at me defending her babies.  Quite terrifying.
-I survived the monotony of Shenandoah National Park.  It was by far the most boring part of he whole trail - very poorly built and maintained trails, easy hills, constant road noise and tourist presence, and as best I can tell the only reason it is a national park instead of a county picnic area is its proximity to Washington, D.C.  A lot of this has to do with a level of commercialization that makes Yosemite look like complete wilderness.
-Rain.... so much rain.... we got the tail end of a tropical storm.  Another hiker counted 13 days in a row with rain, and I would believe it.
-I’ve had 3 key visitors - my wife, my dad, and my friend Mike.  It has been good to see people and give them exposure to the trail, but it has also slowed down my mileage significantly.  Great visits, but really looking forward to moving forward now with open-ended plans so I can make my own pace and planning going forward.

-I hadn’t actually crossed the 1/2 way mark last time. Now at 70% of mileage complete, but the hardest is yet to come.
-Started solo hiking again.  The group was amazing, but I just wanted to fully embrace the solo hiking experience.  I have enjoyed setting my own pace thoroughly.
-Lost my glasses.  Spent 2 weeks in my prescription sunglasses, an experience I’d rather not try again.
-Broke my tent pole.  Never seen a tent failure quite this catastrophic.  Mended it the next day in town, and got replacement poles quickly, but had a really tenuous setup for a while that luckily never endured a serious rain.
-Went through a brutal heat wave.  It is raining right now, but for two weeks recently it was so hot that hiking was a cardio strain and (more importantly) quality sleep was hard to come by.  Everyone on the trail was a bit zombie-like for that period.  The mosquitos also combine with the heat for a double-whammy.
-Having tension in my left calf.  This has always been an issue for me, but only cropped up on the trail recently.  It has caused several zero days that I hadn’t planned.
-Overall having a good hike and getting great support on the above issues from the team back home.  Will be honest that these last states are the more boring ones, and I’m looking forward to Vermont, NH, and Maine to end on some beauty.
-I’m a bit outside any bubbles now, which is great.  Having days with seeing only 6 hikers, only 2-4 at camp.  Most hikers around me now left much later, but I’ve embraced my slower hike to enjoy the journey and the wilderness. I’ve really enjoyed being around less people and stopping to enjoy parts of the trail and towns that I want to.  Lots of lakes up here recently that I’ve been lunching at.

Thank you all for your kind thoughts.  Will try to update again as I close in on Katahdin!

Stretch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600546,"Mile 1817.9, 373.0 to goI'm in New Hampshire now, just started the White Mountains.  Staying at an excellent Hostel called The Notch to get a package in Lincoln before tackling some of the hardest parts of the trail.  So far I'm handling it fine, just slowly.Vermont and New Hampshire have been beautiful, although most of the traditional mountaintop views have been clouded in.  Looking forward to hitting Maine and continuing to get more remote.  It's been nice to get deeper into New England and away from the larger cities.  This has meant more stretches of solitude, and less day hikers until recently in the Whites.  It's been nice to do some good stealth camping and have my own site most nights, although I also ducked into some empty or uncrowded shelters during the rains we've been having.I will post some more pictures soon as well.  I've realized I have very few pictures of myself, so I'll be trying to get more as the trail progresses.The trail has been great!!  Looking forward to the rest.","

Stretch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601530,"1934 miles, 256.9 to go.I made it to Maine!! I’ve done a zero in Andover at a new hostel in a geodesic dome on 50 acres.  It’s been good over the last few towns to see more of the same people again.  It feels really satisfying to have made it to the final state.  I’ve got my eyes on Katahdin now. I don’t if I’ll have enough connectivity and time before the end to update again.  Maine has been pretty remote, which is greats. I’ll update here with thoughts at some point, but thanks to everyone for reading so far!","

Stretch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603262,"I DID IT!!!! I summited Katahdin on 9/13/18.  I started the hike before 5AM with an hour of headlamp hiking, and actually ended up being the first thru hiker on the summit that day around 9AM.  It was exhilarating and exhausting all at the same time.  I ended up spending 2 hours at the summit taking it all in and celebrating with the other ~10 hikers that summited that morning.It's been an amazing journey.  More thoughts later as I become more human, and I'm hoping to write some more concrete retrospective as I go back through all my photos and data.  In the mean time - here is Stretch at the top of Katahdin after 2,190.9 miles!!","
