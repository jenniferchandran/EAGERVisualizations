Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582119,"As the sun sets on a 36 year Army career, my wife and I are ready to set out on a new journey -- an Appalachian Trail (AT) thru-hike! My military stint kicked off in 1982 as a Private in the Kentucky National Guard, where I served six years, while earning a degree and commission from Eastern Kentucky University. Fast forward to 2018, when I retire as an Army Colonel with 30 years of active duty service. The AT bug first hit me during in the winter of 1989 while undergoing Ranger training in the North Georgia Mountains. My post-Ranger School vow to never again be needlessly cold, hungry, or tired was eventually superseded by that incessant calling to hike the AT. The passion took residence deep in my gut and intensified with each passing year, and every AT book/article I read. There is only one cure now -- WALK IT OFF! It is an even greater blessing to share the pending journey with my beautiful wife and best friend. I reckon she just couldn't stand to sit back and watch as I had all the fun.  We plan to begin our journey on 24 February 2018, just a couple of weeks after my 55th Birthday, at Springer Mountain, Georgia (AT southern terminus).  From there we will plod northward, following the “white blazes” for 2,190 miles, to Mount Katahdin, Maine (northern terminus). We will hike under the aliases—trail names—Which Way (her) and Next Step (him). In no hurry to end our adventure, we anticipate that we will summit Mt. K in late August, just a few weeks after our 30th Anniversary. After years of romanticizing and preparation, we are excited beyond words to start our trek of a lifetime. We hope to record our hike in this digital trail journal, which we plan to update daily, and hope you will find both interesting and informative. All of the encouragement and prayers you care to send our way are welcome and will undoubtedly help to keep us strong, as we pursue our dream.",,View Entry,"Jan 15, Mon",0
Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582120,"The Appalachian National Scenic Trail, commonly referred to as the Appalachian Trail (or simply the AT), is a continuous footpath extending from Springer Moutnain in Georgia to Mount Katahdin in Maine. The Appalachian Trail was conceived by a forester named Benton MacKaye in 1921. MacKaye's idea detailed a grand trail that would connect a series of farms and wilderness work/study camps for city-dwellers. His dream took hold, the AT was completed in 1937, and it continues to be improved upon and maintained by 31 trail clubs and multiple partnerships. The trail is managed by the National Park Service, United States Forest Service, and the nonprofit Appalachian Trail Conservancy. 
Reportedly the longest hiking-only trail in the world, the AT is approximately 2,190 miles long and runs through 14 states—Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. The majority of the trail is in forest or wild lands, although some portions traverse towns, roads and farms. The AT is well marked with 2x6 inch white blazes, painted at close intervals, on trees, boulders, and posts. However, the terrain is often rugged, with steep ascents and descents. The cumulative elevation gain of the AT is equivalent to climbing Mount Everest 16 times. 
It is estimated that more than two million people set foot on the AT each year. The nearly 3,000 individuals who attempt to hike the entire trail in a single season are referred to as ""thru-hikers"".” It is said that less than one out of every four hikers that set out to thru-hike the trail complete their goal. Many books, memoirs, journals, websites, and fan organizations are dedicated to these pursuits. The Appalachian Trail, the Continental Divide Trail, and the Pacific Crest Trail form what is known as the Triple Crown of HIking in the United States.",,View Entry,"Jan 16, Tue",0
Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582121,"Needless to say, it is difficult to prepare physically for walking 8-22 miles daily, over rugged and steep terrain, in harsh weather conditions, carrying 20-30 pounds of gear, food and water on your back, and doing this for consecutive days on end for over five months. Many accomplished thru-hikers even say that the effort is futile. Still, there are a few things we did that give us confidence to begin our thru-hike. A snippet of how we prepared, for what it’s worth...
Homework : There are hundreds of backpacking and AT books, forums, videos, and on-line journals (like this one) available to aspiring thru-hikers. Together, these sources offer a wealth of information about the AT, hiking gear, back country camping, trail food, first-aid, safety, etc. I recommend starting with an entertaining read about the AT. When the idea of hiking the AT took hold in me, I picked up a few books written about the trail. Like most people who have read books about the AT, my first read was A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson. Ironically, it ended up being my least favorite of dozens of books I have read. In case you were wondering, my favorite AT read is Walk’n On The Happy Side Of Misery by J.R. Tate. After reading several “my AT experience” books, I graduated to more technical books about hiking and backpacking. A few years back, I started reading AT Thru-hiker Journals. By then, I knew that I would be hiking with my wife and that we would likely be starting a Northbound (NOBO) hike in February. Therefore, I would troll trailjournals.com looking for “mature” couples starting their hike early in the season. Pick several hikers to follow, as some will not complete their hike. Trail journals should give you a good feel for what to expect on the trail. 
Simulated Hike:This is probably overkill for most, but I did a “simulated hike” the year before the real thing. Here’s how it worked. Using the 2017 A.T. Guide and the AT Weather App, I started the simulated hike exactly one year before our actual hike. Just like I suspect we will do on the trail, I would make a tentative plan each week (highlighting shelters, hostels, groceries, etc in the guidebook), then check the weather and record data daily on a spreadsheet (i.e. day #, start/finish location, daily AT miles hiked, distance to/from Mt. K/Springer, elevation gain, weather data, lodging/re-supply/landmark data, etc.).  I started the simulated hike doing 8-10 miles a day, ramping up to 14-20 miles, depending on the elevation and conditions. Overall, it proved to be a worthwhile exercise and it helped to keep me sane for six months. Basically, I could no longer bear reading about other hiker’s adventures.
Walk, Hike, Backpack: While we could not possibly replicate the type of conditions we will endure on the AT, we at least tried to get outdoors and log miles at least 5-6 days a week. Sometimes this was as simple as walking 4-8 miles around in our community. Fortunately, we live within 30 minutes of some decent hiking and 90 minutes from the Shenandoah National Park. We tried to get out for an 8-14 mile day hike every week or two. Finally, we were able to work in a dozen 2-3 day backpacking trips over the past two years. These mini-trips provided an opportunity to learn what worked. Bonus, backpacking is fun, even when it’s not!
“The Gear Between the Ears:” While it is certainly desirable to start the hike with the right gear and in good physical condition, shortcomings in these two areas can be overcome while on the trail. However, knowing what you are getting into, possessing intestinal fortitude, and simply expecting the unexpected seem to be imperative elements to a successful thru-hike. Zack Davis’s Appalachian Trials explores these concepts in detail and provides practical recommendations for preparing mentally for an AT thru-hike. We have tried to put many of these concepts into practice.",,View Entry,"Jan 17, Wed",0
Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583049,"We are in a mad dash to the start line. Since I set up our trail journal in January it has been a flurry  of activity, mostly revolving around retiring from the Army and re-locating to, uh, the Appalachian Trail. The  Reader’s Digest version follows...
Up until 19 January, the primary  effort was handing off job related responsibilities and organizing a retirement ceremony, which turned out being a very nice and emotion-filled event. It brought together family and many friends and we all reminisced over memories spanning a 30-year Army career and did a little contemplating about the “Next Step.” 
The days since the ceremony have been filled with medical appointments and other transition activities. As it turns out, getting out of the military is harder than getting in. 
Most of our energy over the past two weeks was spent on moving out of our house in DC. The bulk of our belongings were packed up by the moving company and sent to storage for an unknown period of time. However, we kept back our most-prized possessions (i.e. backpacking gear) and a few things required to sustain us post-hike, as our next place of residence is unknown. 
After “clearing quarters” in DC we crammed our temporary possessions into a small utility trailer and hauled it to Alicia’s parents’ house in Kentucky. After taking all day Friday to set up our post-hike living quarters, yesterday we turned our attention back to AT planning. This involved sorting medications, food, etc. and stuffing them into five separate mail drops and a bounce box. The mail drops will eventually be sent to various locations along the trail, where we anticipate limited re-supply. The bounce box contains medications and other items we will need to access frequently, but opt not to carry in our backpacks. The plan is to simply “bounce” these items ahead of us as we work our way north.
So, now we find ourselves with under a wee until our AT journey begins. But, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We must travel back to DC on Monday to finish up some Army business and tie up some personal loose strings.  On Wednesday we dri to my stepmom’s place in Atlanta, where we will make final preparations on Thursday and Friday and perhaps squeeze in a little family time.  Saturday will come soon enough and we will undoubtedly find ourselves sprinting the final leg of our race to the start line—Springer Mountain.THEN, we can slow our pace and live in the moment!
P.S. We want to thank everyone who has signed our guest book and offered words of encouragement. It means a lot to us!",,View Entry,"Feb 18, Sun",0
Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583308,"A lifetime dream, enabled by opportunity, became our reality today. We are really hiking the Appalachian Trail! Wait, there’s more! With 8.1 miles of A.T. hiking behind us, we still get to do this for another 2,182.8 miles over the next six months. 
Day one of our hike started in Atlanta, where nine of us piled into two vehicles and headed for the mountains. We had an amazing “send off” party—Patrick, Rachael, Irene, Lisa, Ralph, Christopher, and Ashley.  They certainly showed a lot of grit in delivering us safely to the trail. 

It was about a 90-minute drive to Amicalola Falls State Park, with another 45 minutes added on for a breakfast stop at Billie’s Country Kitchen on the outskirts of Dawsonville.  From there it was a quick 20 minute drive to the Visitors Center, where Which Way and I officially registered for our A.T. thru hike, as hiker’s number 294 and 295, respectively. Will, a hiker from New Zealand, was among the half dozen or so other aspiring thru hikers who were also registering at the visitor center. According to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC), 35 hikers pre-registered and declared 24 FEB as their starting date. The numbers of hikers starting each day will jump significantly in March and then begin to taper in April. 

The visitor center has a hook scale on the front porch for weighing gear. Which Way and I weighed our packs loaded with four days of provisions and 2 liters of water each. Which Way weighed in at 28 pounds and I, at slightly over 35 pounds.  That put our base weights (weight without food and water) at 21 and 25 lbs respectively. With a few adjustments and elimination of winter gear (still six or more weeks out) we should drop about 5-7 lbs each. Nonetheless, our packs fit comfortably and we were not hindered from the heavier- than- desired load.

Behind the visitors center is an arch marking the beginning an 8.1 mile “approach trail,” leading to Springer Mountain, the southern terminus of the A.T.  The approach trail begins with 600+ stair steps and continues with a steep, challenging climb to Springer. The other option is to drive about 30 miles to a parking lot bisected by the A.T. just one mile trail south of the summit of Springer. Opting for the drive, we snapped a few pics at the approach trail archway and piled back into our vehicles. The 60 minute drive offered some challenges of its own, as the final 6.5 miles was on a gravel, dirt, muddy, pothole-ridden Forest Service Road. It was touch and go, but both vehicles made it to the parking area. However, one unnamed member of our party was visibly shaken from the ride. When we arrived at the parking area, not only was it full, but there was a bit of commotion with emergency vehicles along the road and in the parking lot. More on that later.

We eventually parked the vehicles and the nine of us started the one mile walk south on the A.T. to Springer Mountain. To think, the first mile of our hike does not even count toward A.T. miles hiked, but is included in the daily mileage. Anyway, the walk up featured an 800 foot ascent over a somewhat rocky terrain.

The top of Springer Mountain is marked by a plaque and the first of thousands of white blazes was painted on a rock. It also offers a nice view of the surrounding area. We took a few minutes to snap pictures and let it all sink in.  There was a metal container built into a rock. Inside was a logbook that Which Way signed for us. Patrick took a quick video of me explaining to Jeff Probst that I was fulfilling a life’s dream while waiting for an invitation to Survivor Island. Meanwhile, Which Way was on the phone with her parents. They sang “Happy Trails” to her. Finally, at 12:15 PM our A.T. hike officially started and we worked our way back down to the parking lot. This time, the mile counted. At the parking lot, we bid farewell to our family and wished them safe travels down the Forest Service Road. We are so blessed to have a family that desired to share this special day with us and thankful that they made the send-off such a special memory. 

After saying our final good-byes, we hiked seven more easy miles to Hawk Mountain Shelter. We walked most of the afternoon on soft terrain through some old growth forest and along and over several beautiful mountain streams. The unseasonably warm temperatures brought out many day hikers and some trout anglers. We also passed by a few thru hikers, including a blind man and his wife—together they are the Dynamic Duo—from Ohio. The man was also a former Army Medic. What an inspiring story! 

When we arrived at the shelter at 5:00PM it was full, so we pitched our tent on a level piece of terrain, filtered water and cooked dinner. While eating dinner, another hiker told me the tragic story causing the chaos at the Springer Mountain parking area. The hiker’s family was not able to make it up the steep, muddy Forest Service Road, so they let him out and he started walking towards Springer. It wasn’t long before a vehicle with a father and his two sons stopped to offer him a ride. One of the sons was to start his A.T. thru hike. Like us, he and his family started the one mile hike up Springer Mtn. Tragically, the father had a massive heart attack just 50 yards from the top and died. I can only imagine the pain that his family is enduring on what should have been a day of elation. Please pray for them. 

It is well past hiker midnight, 9:00PM, and time to get some rest, as Which Way and I are hoping to get back on the trail before the rain sets in tomorrow.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583344,"Rain was in today’s forecast so we figured it would be a good idea to break camp early and start moving before the skies opened up. I rolled out of the tent about 30 minutes before daylight and it immediately started to drizzle. Even though it was dark I could see that the air was thick, so I suggested to Which Way that we should kick it into high gear. Too late! Within 30 seconds we were in a downpour.  Working from inside the tent, we managed to get our stuff into our packs. We then dashed up to the shelter, where we hung out until the rain let up a bit. Then we packed up our tent and started hiking a little after 8:00AM. It wasn’t long before the rain picked up again and continued to come down pretty hard until about 10:00. We were almost to the top of Sassafras Mountain, the highest climb of the day and we were discussing how good we were feeling. About that time, as I was working my way over a slab of wet, moss covered rock, my right foot slipped out from under me When I tried to catch myself, my upper leg buckled up under me and I severely torqued my quad. It felt as if I had applied 10 more pounds of pressure, my femur would have snapped. I laid there for a while waiting for the pain to subside before trying to gather my feet under me. Of course, Which Way was worried that a bone might be sticking out. Fortunately, that was not the case. After a few minutes, I was able to stand up. I them gimped along  for a bit before the pain let  let up enough for me to hike on. I felt pretty good until we stopped to filter water and it started locking up again. Just wondering what it’s going to be like tomorrow when I wake up! 

We made it to the shelter around 3:00, which was nice. Which Way and I had time to get everything set up and go hang out with the other hikers before making supper. The Ridge Runner staying at the shelter counted 14 thru hikers, most of which stayed at the same location as us the night before. Our first mini hiker bubble!

Getting dark and rain is picking up again. Tomorrow’s forecast, more rain. Embrace the suck! - Next Step

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583366,"Pitter-patter,
pitter-patter. That was the sound made by the light rain hitting the outer wall
of our tent as we settled in at 7:30 last night. The combination of that
soothing noise and temps in the low 50s quickly lulled us to sleep. But, as the
light rain intensified into a heavier, steady rain and accumulated on the tree
branches above, before falling in big drops on our tent, the pitter-patter gave
way to another sound—plop-plunk, pop-plunk! And that was the sound that woke us
(or at least me) at 10:30PM. The persistent rain continued through the night
and into the morning.  Nonetheless, we remained warm and dry through the
night. That is, except for the occasional spray of moisture that managed to
work its way through the inner wall of the tent.
At
5:00AM I had enough signal to check the radar and hourly weather. It appeared
that the rain was going to continue to fall for a few more hours, but would
move out around 9:00. So, as Which Way snored away, I made a command decision.
We would remain in the tent for a couple of more hours, then gather our things
on the inside of the tent and head up to the shelter for breakfast. By the time
we arrived at the shelter, a few brave souls had already hit the trail for the
day. After breakfast, the rain stopped, so we struck the tent and cleaned some
of our gear in a nearby stream. Before we departed, Which Way took care of a
blister on her pinky toe and I popped my third 800mg Motrin. It appears that
the Motrin, the use of a muscle roller that a fellow hiker loaned me, some
intensive stretching (thanks to Stretch—more on her later), and a good night’s
sleep, worked wonders for my leg.
Finally
hitting the trail at 10:15, we were the last hikers to depart the area. Even
the Ridge Runner beat us out by a few minutes. But just as we were leaving, the
sun peeked through the clouds, the beginning of a perfect hiking day. 
We
crossed over two mountains of decent ascent. The first, Ramrock Mtn., offered a
great view of adjacent mountains and a valley to the south. As we were taking in
the scenery, a day hiker came up and snapped a picture for us. He also pointed
out that you could make out the Atlanta skyline, 70 miles away. Cool!
By
now we were hiking in shorts and feeling pretty good as we crossed our first
paved road, HWY 60, at Woody Gap. This is where two female hikers from our
mini-bubble informed us that they would be departing the trail well short of
their intended destination. I think that they were carrying about 50 lbs each
and one of them had a pack that did not fit well. There was a picnic area at
Woody Gap, restrooms, and the best part, bear proof trash canisters. At this
point, we (actually Which Way) were carrying more weight in trash than food. As
we were joyously depositing our garbage in the canister, I noticed a large bag
of coffee. It undoubtedly belonged to Joe, another hiker in our bubble, who had
been trying to give it away since Springer. 
Shortly
after passing through Woody Gap, we saw our first snake sunning on the trail.
It was an Eastern Ribbon Snake that measured about 2 feet. As we approached,
the fellow quickly slithered away. I must say that he was moving pretty quickly
for a February snake.
About
halfway up our second modest ascent, Cedar Mountain, we broke for lunch. We saw
one other day hiker, again moving in the opposite direction, and no A.T. hikers
the rest of the day. 
We
stopped hiking for the day at 3:30 at a campsite along Lance Creek. We are the
only hikers here, as most of the group had indicated that they were continuing
a bit farther up the trail to Woods Hole Shelter. However, there was a younger
couple from Charlotte that we had expected to see here.  We met the couple
on the trail yesterday and the man was really struggling. I figured we would
pass them along the way today.  I sure hope they did not exit the trail at
Woody Gap. We were able to clean up the rest of our gear, dry out our wet tent,
cook dinner and talk to the kids before sunset. A good finish to a great day!
Tomorrow
should offer some great hiking weather, sunny with a high near 50 as we hike
our way to our first milestone, Blood Mountain, the highest peak in
Georgia. 
As
I finish this post, I am sitting on a log under a full moon with nothing but he
sound of a mountain stream. The temperature is quickly dropping into the low
thirties and Which Way is already warm and comfy in our tent. I think I should
join her. - Next Step

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583415,"Now THAT was an
AMAZING day!!! Had hoped to get a really early start this morning, but when the
alarm went off at 6:00 and it was still in the 30’s, I told Next Step to feel
free to try and get a little more sleep. Still got up before 7:00 and started
our morning ritual of packing up and breakfast. Headed out around 8:45 and
began our steady ascent to Blood Mountain, the highest Peak in Georgia (4,457
feet). With a bright blue sky and cool breeze, it was a perfect day for a
hike.  Like yesterday, the ground under our feet was mostly soft, but
thankfully not nearly as squishy from the rain.
Shortly before
reaching Blood Mountain, we passed Jarred Gap (A.T. Mile 26.1). In 1996, when
our son was 4 and our daughter was 2, we started hiking the A.T.
from Springer Mtn. as a family and inched our way slowly north along the AT.
When we went to visit Next Step’s Dad in Atlanta, he would often bring us to
the North Georgia Mountains. Grandpa would drop us off at one of the mountain
gaps and navigate his way in the car to another location a few miles up the
trail as the kids walked, rock-hopped, splashed, or rode on their Dad’s
shoulders to the pick-up spot. So, what does this have to do with Jarred Gap?
Well, that is as far north as we would make it in several hikes spanning a few
years. So, all of this section of the trail north of Jarred’s Gap is new
territory for us.
Blood Mountain
did not disappoint. The scenery during the ascent was awesome and the view from
the top was breathtaking. The climb was strenuous, but not overly difficult. As
advertised, the descent was a much steeper grade and the surface was
predominantly granite. On a wet day, it would have been a tenuous trek down,
but today it was just fun. 
Blood Mountain
was just one milestone in a day of milestones for us. At the bottom of the
mountain was the iconic Mountain Crossings Outfitter and Hostel at Walasi-Yi,
Neel’s Gap. We arrived around 1:15 and I headed straight to the counter to buy
my Coke Zero, the first one I’d had since Saturday!! We decided that with the
upcoming forecast of some pretty heavy rain all day Wednesday and Thursday
morning we would take a Zero on Wednesday. More importantly, the forecast for
several days beyond Thursday looks great. We want to maximize trail time on
those types of days so we moved our planned Zero at Unicoi Gap (Hiawassee, GA)
up a few days. We will now likely just do a quick re-supply at Hiawassee, then
return to the trail.
Now Mountain
Crossings is definitely an AMAZING outfitter, but I really didn’t want my first
pizza on the hike to come out of a freezer, so we made a decision to catch a
shuttle into Blairsville and spend two nights there. The shuttle
team, Donald and Mary, were wonderful and extremely helpful, telling us
everything we needed to know about the little town of Blairsville. We headed to
the Seasons Inn which is run by another really nice and super
accommodating couple. A pizza place right across from the motel?!?! Um,
hello...Can it really get any better than this? Actually, yes. Before heading
to Papa’s Pizza (BTW, an all-you-can-eat buffet for $7.07 including your drink.
I’ll have two of those buffets, please!)  I got my first shower since
Saturday. It really makes you appreciate the little things, for sure!! After
supper we walked into town to the Family Dollar and Ingall’s to re-supply. We came
back and got the laundry done so that we can do nothing but R&R on our Zero
(AND there’s even a movie theater, so you know that’s where we’ll be tomorrow
afternoon with candy and popcorn). Have only been out here for 4 days, but
feeling blessed beyond measure. Thank you all for the prayers and encouraging
words. God is holding us tightly in His amazing hands! - Which WayElevation Data:

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583472,"When
you are hiking the AT it doesn’t take long to figure out that you will be
hiking in rain, and rain just makes everything harder to do. It also doesn’t
take long to figure out that the best day for rain is a Zero Day.  Mainly
because you want to be hiking on the sunny days. Well, today was our first Zero
Day and it rained hard last night, most of the day, and is raining really hard this
evening. While we didn’t exactly dance in the wet stuff, we were certainly
satisfied with our decision to take our Zero a couple of days earlier than
originally planned.
As Which Way mentioned in the last post, we got most of our town
chores knocked out yesterday afternoon/evening. That left today for, uh, rest
and relaxation. For us that means eating, entertainment, and stretching. 
As it turns out, Blairsville fit the bill just fine for two of the three. 
Although we were awake before daylight, we took our sweet time
getting out of bed and getting ready for the day. The Seasons Inn sits on the
town square and on the other side of the square, maybe 200 meters away, sits a hole-in-the-wall
restaurant. Fittingly, the name of the establishment is, you guessed it, “Hole
in the Wall.” So, we sauntered over to the other side of the square, in the
rain (happily), and enjoyed a great breakfast. Our server, Katie, and the rest
of the staff were super friendly, a common character trait for the town-folk
here in Blairsville.  After breakfast we walked a little further down the
road to Zaxby’s, where Which Way scored a Coke Zero fitting of a ZERO.  I
tell you she can sniff out a Coke Zero from 25 miles away (or whatever the
range of her Coke Zero app is). 
Back at the Season’s Inn, we had some time to kill before
entertainment, so we did some stretching. I mentioned in a previous post that a
gal named Stretch (a.k.a. Natalie) turned us on to some good stretches to do on
the trail. We came across Stretch and her husband, Preacher (a.k.a Justin), at
a hut (i.e. shelter) while backpacking in the Shenandoah National Park last
Fall. Stretch and Preacher were SOBOs (Southbound AT Thru Hikers), who were a
little over halfway from Maine to Georgia.  Stretch was feeling a bit
under the weather, so we offered to take them back to our place in DC for some
R&R. We headed north from the hut the next morning, after providing the
cool couple our contact info. That was the last we expected to hear from them.
The next day, as we were headed home, I got a phone signal about the time we
were exiting the park and one of the messages that populated my phone was from
Preacher. He indicated that Stretch’s condition had worsened, they had caught a
ride to a clinic in Front Royal, and would take us up on our offer. Well, after
a couple of nights of rest, medication, and some of Which Way’s good cooking,
we returned the sweet couple to the trail. But, not before Stretch, true to her
name, demonstrated some good stretches for us. She also promised to add her
routine to her trail blog. She kept her promise and they finished their
commitment to thru-hike the AT, summiting Springer Mtn just before
Thanksgiving. Not the end of the story. Preacher and Stretch relocated in the
Little Rock area post-hike. Well, our son and his wife live in Little
Rock. We encouraged them to get together and they now worship at the same
Church and are good friends. I tried unsuccessfully to post Stretches blog
post to the Articles section of this TJ—i.o. (Idiot Operator) I’m sure. Anyway,
if you care to check out Stretch’s stretches and/or learn more of this couple’s
amazing story go to https://happytrailsandwanderlust.wordpress.com.
Stretching complete, we were all set for entertainment, in the
form of...a movie! What can I say? We just don’t sit still for very long. The
Blairsville Theater is a couple of miles out of town, down a two-lane highway,
and it was still raining, so we called Donald’s Shuttle Service again. Donald
and Mary gladly came to pick us up and delivered us to the theater for a small
fee of $10, or whatever we could swing. We love this couple as they are totally
chill. Donald works in the word “dude” several times in each sentence, as Mary
drives and nods her head north and south. 
We had a good laugh at the theater. Before it started, I
approached a couple who appeared to be around our age and ask if they just
happened to be going back to town after the movie if they would be so kind as
to give us a lift. Although I love hanging with Donald and Mary and know they
would gladly take us back for free, we had already spent $40 on shuttle rides
and we want to stick to a budget. Anyway, the couple seemed a little taken back
when I asked for a ride. I explained to them we were hiking the AT,
blah-blah-blah. It seemed like they wanted to help out (as is the Blairsville
way), but were cautiously considering my request. The man, Mike, wisely checked
out my story by asking questions like “where did you begin your hike?” and “where
did you stay last night…come off the trail?”. Feeling that I had passed the
Mike test, but not wanting to press for an immediate answer (something I
learned in an “Art and Skills of Negotiations” class), I said, “No problem
either way (dude), just enjoy the movie (dude), and (dude) if you’re up for it
(dude) just let us know afterwards (dude)."" As I started back to my seat,
feeling that the deal was almost sealed, I turned back to the well-kept couple
and said, “We had a shower this morning (dude).” With that, BJ, Mike’s bride,
laughed out loud, and Mike said that they would see us in the lobby (dude). I
knew right then that we were “getting to yes!”
After the movie, Which Way and I lingered a bit, as to give Mike
and BJ a chance to bolt before the ink on the quasi-deal had dried. But, they
were waiting for us in the lobby and gladly gave us a ride to town. Although
not cut from the same cloth as Donald and Mary, Mike and BJ were a lovely
couple and we chatted it up on the short ride back to town. I wish we would
have had more time to get to know them, but such is the AT. As we were
about to exit the vehicle, BJ asked if we had a blog or something where they
could follow our journey. I handed them one of our trail cards with the website
to our TJ and we said so long, for now.
BTW...I sent Donald a text letting him know we had found a ride
back, knowing that he would in some way be proud of me and wanting to keep the
door open for a ride in the morning. His response, “Not a problem. Of course
you can call us for a ride. Glad you are safe. Hope you had fun. Have a great
night. Be peaceful!” I guess he doesn’t “dude” while texting.
After the movie, we packed our gear then went to a Cuban
restaurant that Donald had recommended. Once again, he was right on,
dude! 
Back in our motel room we did some more stretching (thanks
Stretch) and repacked (something us beginning thru-hikers like to do). 
All in all, our first town experience was fantastic and we
officially certify Blairsville as a “hiker friendly town.” Nonetheless, we are
ready to get back on the trail. Tomorrow should be a challenging day—most
miles, greatest total ascent, and 1-2” of cold RAIN. Keep us in your prayers. - Next

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583518,"You
know the old adage, “March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb.”
In the North Georgia Mountains, the month of March definitively arrived roaring
like a lion. 
The
day started in Blairsville, where we took one final shower, loaded our packs,
and dropped the room keys in the drop box. We arrived at The Hole in the Wall
at 7AM, just as they were opening for business. Entering just ahead of us were
the town Sheriff and a few other regulars, all of whom our server, Vicky, knew
by name. We grabbed a booth immediately to the left, placed our packs on the
floor, in between the booth and the door.  Vicky was standing at our table in no time
flat ready to take our order.  Good service and good food left us full,
satisfied, and out the door in thirty minutes. As we were settling our bill
with Vicky, I overheard one of the locals commenting to his buddy, “there was
no way I would be caught hiking in this weather.” 
Along
the traffic circle circumnavigating the town square, the Seasons Inn sits on
the NE side at one o’clock and the Hole in the Wall sits at 11 o’clock. The two
crazy hikers (aka Which Way and Next Step) continued counter-clockwise to six
o’clock, where US 19 North exited the traffic circle. That is the road that leads
to Neels Gap, and these crazy hikers were going to hitch their first ride from
this very spot. Before I could take my pack off, Which Way, pack still on,
stuck out her thumb. Thirty seconds, and three cars later, she turned to me,
looking disgusted that no one had stopped yet to offer us crazies a lift.
Personally I thought she looked rather cute in her red rain jacket and pack on
her back and it would just be a matter of time before someone would stop to
pick us up. However, I was a bit concerned that Which Way’s ego was about to
get bruised. That’s when I put my head on a swivel, looking desperately for a
quick way to avoid the pending tragedy. Over my shoulder (five o’clock on the
circle) I eyed a man looking out the door of the Cabin Coffee Cafe and I gave
him a friendly wave. He waved back and stood there a few seconds contemplating
his next move, as I willed him to cometh hither. Then, just as Which Way was
about to risk her fourth rejection in less than 40 seconds, the fellow stepped
out the door and hollered, “Do ya’ll need a ride?” One minute later and we had
our packs secured in the bed of his pick-up and hopped inside his vehicle.
Which Way slid into a jump seat as tour driver, Bill, moved his Bible and some
papers out of the passenger seat to make room for me. 
As
it turns out, Bill was the unpaid greeter at the Cabin Coffee Cafe. The nice
fellow certainly possessed the gift of gab needed for such a role. We spent
most of the 20 minute ride to Neels Gap listening to Bill’s story about the
time he met Mike Greenberg, of ESPN’s Mike and Mike, right there at the Cabin
Coffee Cafe. Turns out, Mike Greenberg had just finished covering the Masters
and drove up to the mountains. Why? According to Bill, Mr. Greenberg thought he
might someday want to hike a section of the AT and wanted to give it a closer
look. Evidently, Bill and Mike are now Facebook Friends, making them both
genuinely nice people. When we arrived at Mountain Crossings I offered to
give Bill some money for gas. Of course, he said no, so we grabbed our gear,
thanked him, and parted ways. 
There
is a Hiker Hostel on the left end of the structure that houses the Outfitter at
Mountain Crossings. The two are separated by a breezeway and there is a White
Blaze (A.T. marker) painted on the breezeway to signify to hikers that the
trail passes through the structure. There is a Blue Blaze painted on the
hand rail of the steps leading down to the Hostel. As I waited outside, Which
Way took the blue blaze, slipping into the Hostel for a quick potty break. As I
waited for her, another hiker approached that I recognized from our Day 1-3,
mini-hiker bubble. It was Craig (aka Heartburn), the retired EMT who was a
first responder for the man who had the fatal heart-attack hiking up Springer
Mtn last Saturday. He was anointed with his trail name on the first night when
he asked if anyone had any Tums. You guessed it, one of the girls with the 50lb
packs was eager to assist, reducing her pack weight by .01 ounces. Anyway,
Heartburn had been hiking with Ron, who was having knee issues and would be
taking another Zero Day. Heartburn said that several of the hikers from the
first few days were staying in Blood Mountain Cabins. Of note, the Dynamic Duo
(blind hiker and his wife) were in a Cabin.
Alicia
emerged from the Hostel and reported that about a dozen hikers were milling
around. One of the young girls said she hiked down Blood Mountain in the rain
yesterday and didn’t think she would make it down alive. After Heartburn
snapped our pic, we all passed through the breezeway at 8:30 to begin our
day’s hike. Which Way and I planned to hike 11.5 miles to Low Gap Shelter.
Heartburn said he would probably stealth camp (unofficial camping site)
somewhere short of Low Gap. There is another shelter about six miles north of
Mountain Crossings, but it is over a mile down a blue blaze trail. 
Back
to “in like a lion”. It was windy, foggy, and spitting rain when we stepped out
and immediately began the 900’ ascent up Levelland Mountain. We stopped a short
distance up the trail to remove our rain jackets. As was did so, Heartburn
passed us by. The temperature was hovering around 55 degrees, but it felt much
colder with the blowing rain, unless you are toting a 25/30 lb pack up the
mountain. I hiked in my shorts and short sleeves most of the day. Which Way
hiked in rain pants and her jacket came on and off with the rain. We overtook
Heartburn about halfway up the mountain, as he was taking a picture of a tree
that looked to him like a monster in the thick fog/clouds. We did not see him
again for the remainder of the hike. Which Way and I felt really good coming
out of our Zero and we conquered the first, and steepest, of the four mountains
we climbed today.
The
rain really picked up around 11:00 and the temperatures began to fall shortly
thereafter. By noon, we were seven miles into the hike and only one hiker,
“Hungry Cat” had passed us by. He said that several other hikers were close
behind. 
Our
trail guide indicated that Low Gap Shelter only slept seven and there were
limited tent spaces around the shelter.  Which Way and I were hoping to
nab two of the shelter spots, avoiding the hassle of setting up our tent in the
rain. So, when she suggested that we should just press on and eat lunch after
we arrived at the shelter, I agreed. Up until this point in our hike, we made
it a point not to press too hard and to take frequent breaks. But, with the
Lion roaring hard now, we broke form. 
About
eight miles in, as we paused to grab a quick snack, we saw/heard three young
girls below us working their way up to the top on the switchbacks. Selfishly,
not wanting to lose our spot in the shelter, we kicked it into high gear. The
temperature was still dropping and the wind was blowing hard, so I decided to
stop about two miles out and put my rain jacket on, over my soaked clothes,
along with my hiking gloves. Otherwise, I was putting myself at greater risk of
hypothermia. Been there, done that, no fun!
We
breezed into Low Gap Shelter at 2:00PM. Other than Hungry Cat, no additional
hikers had passed us, so we felt good about our chances. Shoot, there would
probably be room for the girls too. As I came down the side trail, I noticed
one person outside the shelter. The opening was covered with a few tent ground
cloths, not a good sign. When I pulled one of the ground cloths aside, gave a
greeting, and waited for smoke, thicker than the surrounding fog to clear, I
counted six hikers. Hey Dude!
No
time to wallow, or we could easily become hypothermic. Job one for us, and the
dozen or so hikers that came streaming in shortly after us, was to get dry
clothes on—or else! Which Way and I found a spot around the back of the
shelter, stripped down, and replaced our cold, wet clothes, with dry, warm wool
and fleece. Just around the corner, the three girls were doing the same.
Stripping down sounds like an easy thing to do, but with our shoes and socks
soaking wet, our shoes caked with mud, and our fingers half frozen, it took
more than a minute to get it done.  Meanwhile, it is still rainy, windy, and muddy;
and the tent still needed to be set up. 
A
few minutes later, the rain let up a bit, so I put my dry rain pants and fairly
soaked rain jacket over my 250 Smartwool base-layer pants/shirt. Which Way’s
rain gear was soaked so she remained under the shelter eave to prepare tuna
wraps as I struck out up the muddy hill, tent in hand. I found a level spot
next to a downed tree (don’t have to worry about that one falling on us
tonight) that looked like it would hold a tent. Usually Which Way and I set up
the tent together, and it is done in less than two minutes. In the wind and
rain it took me about five. In the process, some water had found its way inside
the tent. I’ll worry about that later. Just as I finished staking down the last
vestibule, I stood up and one of the young girls was standing to my right with
her tent in hand. “Sir, do you mind if I set my tent up next to yours?” “No
problem,” I answered. Then I look to my left, a second girl, “Sir, can I put
mine here? I don’t snore.” I replied, “Sure thing, but we do snore.” As I type,
their tents are less than two feet away and Which Way is the only one
snoring. 
By
the time I made it back down to Which Way, several other hikers had arrived and
were performing the same ritual. Among them was Heartburn. 
A
quick tuna wrap, another break in the rain, and we scurried up to the tent to
put our trash compactor bag containing all of our sleeping bag/quilt on the wet
tent floor. We then managed to inflate our sleeping pads with both of us in the
tent together (she usually goes first while I start dinner). Then we snuggled
under my quilt, with me still shivering, and eventually got a little nap. 
It
stopped raining about 5:30PM so we raced down to filter water and cook dinner.
The clothes I was wearing were still damp in places, but they had a chance to
dry out in the wind.  By now it was dark, but I still needed to hang the
bear bags. The cable system used here was not working, as the trees with the
cables attached had blown down in a recent storm. So, I hung our bags the old
fashioned way, throwing a small bag (with a rock inside for weight) attached to
a line over a tree branch. Then I attached our food bags to the line and tied
it off to the same tree.  I got the line over the branch on the first try,
but I realized it was too close to the tree (about two feet vs the recommended
four). I look up, thinking that that is not ideal, then I see that I am
standing on a muddy slope among a bunch of downed trees. Too bad, I thought to
myself, the bears can have it.  I’m going to bed! 
Even
though the conditions were bad today, the hike was still good. Which Way and I
enjoy the challenge of going up and down mountains, but we really did not want
to tax our bodies any more than the terrain dictates, as we are in this for the
long haul. I must say though, it is on days like this that I am blessed to be
married to an amazing woman. She is one tough gal!!! 
Although
it is cold outside and the Lion is roaring hard, we are warm, safe, and dry in
our tent. - Next Step

So, who really thinks about their pinky-toe on an hourly basis?!?! The hiker who has a blister on her pinky-toe. A blister that reforms day after day!!! Seems like something so small would not have much of an impact, but today it is the weakest link that slowed us down. 
Although the lion roared all night, we were not in its direct path, as Low Gap Shelter, is nestled between hills on the south side of the surrounding mountains. So, while we could hear the wind rolling like a freight train most of the night, we barely felt a breeze blowing against our tent. However, our clothes were still soaking wet this morning and not particularly fun to put on with temps in the low 30’s!!! But, the only other option was to keep on our dry camp clothes. Not going to do that! Just gotta suck it up and hike on! 
We were the next to the last ones to depart camp, as we hung some of our wet gear form branches to dry a bit. We finally started our climb out of Low Gap at around 9AM.  It was a slow, steady ascent and we both started out thinking it was going to be easy-peazy. But after the first descent, the pinky-toe started yelling at me and the only thing louder was the right knee that was trying to compensate for the pinky-toe. We stopped several times to try and treat the blister, but finally gave up and just hobbled on. We went up and over several mountains, many of them very rocky, which made for even slower hiking. But that was probably a good thing after we had busted it yesterday trying to get to the shelter. Next Step and I leap-frogged with “Zoltan” most of the day. He is a sweet kid from Atlanta that had previously attempted a thru-hike but had blown out a knee at mile 890. Good for him for coming back and giving it another try!!! 

We made the final 2 mile descent down Blue Mountain and into Unicoi Gap around 3:00, well over an hour later than we had anticipated. There is a parking lot there along US 76. Next Step called a shuttle (didn’t feel like waiting around for someone to give us a ride) and we went straight to the Holiday Inn and I got in the shower while Next Step started the laundry. I was beginning to think he got lost, but finally he came in and was so excited that he had found The Three Amigos, Joe Kool, Dom, and Traveler (Will from New Zealand), who we had met on our first day of hiking! They invited us to walk with them to the local pizza place for another all-you-can-eat buffet. It was half a mile up a two lane highway with no shoulder, but it was PIZZA!!! Suddenly I felt fine!! What pinky-toe?!?!?! It truly was the best part of the day catching up with them and eating pizza!!! We called a taxi to get us back to the motel since it was now after dark. Several cars had gotten a little too close for comfort on the way there, and it was still daylight! I can only imagine what would happen at this time of night.  We went up to the three amigos' room after dinner and checked out JKs and Traveler’s Z-packs (Next Step has backpack envy). JK also let me try on a knee brace he picked up at Rite Aide. YES!!! I will be taking a trip there in the morning as part of our re-supply run. Joe told us that they could not remember our trail names so they had been referring to us as “Colonel” and “The First Lady.” I want to say that each of the Three Amigos are genuinely good-hearted. Traveler is a little closer to our age, but JK and Dom are great kids that anyone would want to adopt as their own. It is people like this that are already making the AT a memorable experience.

We were hoping to be at Top of Georgia Hostel by Sunday, but are now thinking we’ll just put in a couple of low mileage days to let the weakest link heal. There are several more days of sunshine in the forecast, and that is helping turn this frown, upside down:-) Please keep the prayers coming! Thanks to all who have signed our guestbook. It means SO MUCH!!! - Which Way

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583590,"“Hello hikers, class of 1990!” That was the jubilant greeting we received in the hotel lobby last night. It came from an elderly lady pushing a walker. We chatted briefly as we were checking in. Once we were settled in the room, I regretted that I did not get a photo with her. 
We started our day today grabbing a quick breakfast in the hotel with Traveler and Dom. As luck would have it, the white-haired woman reappeared. She shuffled her way over to our table and thanked me for my service. I, in turn, thanked her for paving the way on the AT. She said it was very difficult and one of the hardest things she had ever done, but that it was a “grand adventure,” and well worth the effort. The way she described it reminded me of my favorite AT book, “Walking on the Happy Side of Misery,” by J.R. Tate (aka Model T).  J.R. had me at the title, but the book, which  bounces between JR’s perspective and that of his alter ego, Model T, captures the essence of how a person can be beyond content in less than desirable conditions. The woman said that she hiked the trail the same year as Model T. She was 51 then (the same age as Which Way). When I asked her if she had a trail name, she replied “Larry, of Larry, Moe, and Curly.” She hiked with her husband (Moe) and a friend. Since she had short hair, her husband wanted her to be Curly. She said I’ll be Larry thank you very much. 

We finished our breakfast and said our final farewell’s to Traveler and Dom. We then made a couple of resupply stops and walked back to the hotel to finish packing our gear and I helped Which Way tape her pinky toe.  We then checked out of the hotel and, with our packs on our backs, strolled down the street to Daniels AYCE (All You Can Eat) buffet for a final feeding before returning to the trail.  Joyce, of “Joyce and Sally’s” Shuttle Service picked us up promptly at 11:45. She kindly agreed to stop by “Southern Crossings Outdoors” so we could pick up some canister fuel. Evidently they were the only business in town that carried the small backpacking canisters, as we had already tried three other stores that morning. 

It was a short trip up to Unicoi Gap, where we resumed our hike at 12:15. Wanting to give Which Way’s toe a rest, we planned for a NERO (near zero mile day). To that end, we were considering stopping at the first campsite, about 3.5 miles away. 

The day was absolutely gorgeous, with a big blue sky, temperatures in the low 50s, and a nice breeze. We started our hike with a 1,000’ climb up Rocky Mountain, passing several day hikers along the way. It was good to see so many families spending their Saturday enjoying the mountains. 

About half way up Rocky Mountain, we saw a couple of thru hikers taking a break, so we stopped to chat, as we generally do. It was a man and woman who appeared to be about 10 years younger than us. The man, I will give him the pseudonym “Jump Master” was quick to tell us that he would be writing a book. Then he stood up and looked at my pack and determined I needed to make some adjustments. He asked me take it off and show him how I put it on. His partner, I’ll call her “Grins a Little” didn’t say much, but her body language said “Here we go again.” Anyway, always eager to learn, I loosened my straps, removed my pack and began the demonstration of how I do it. First, I put the pack on the ground, front side down, with the top facing me. I then bend at the knees, reach down between the shoulder straps, grab the pack by the frame, and in one motion I stand up, lifting the pack over my head, releasing my hands from the frame, and letting the pack gently slide down my back. Jump Master was taken aback by my unorthodox method of donning my pack, but the speed and efficiency resulting from my technique brought a sigh of approval from him. I then bent over so that the pack was resting on my back, parallel to the ground, with the bottom of the pack over my hips. I then tightened my hip straps and stood up straight. Jump Master then encouraged me to tighten them more. I then reached up to buckle my chest strap.

“No, shoulder straps first, good and tight. Now the chest strap (good and tight)."" Jump Master then walked behind me and started tightening straps I didn’t even know that I had. His work complete, he gave me one final look over and said, “That’s much better.” The experience reminded me of a jump masters pre-inspection of a paratrooper from my days in the 82nd Airborne Division. “Turn, hold, squat!” Then a good tug on the diagonal straps and slap on the buttocks. 

Jump Master and Grins a Little then got up and put their packs on, apparently ready to hike. I couldn’t help but notice all the gear hanging off their packs and Jump Master’s chest strap riding up on his collarbone.

I also couldn’t help myself...

“It looks like your chest strap is riding a little high.” Just then, I noticed a grin from his partner. “Oh, and your sunglasses are on the ground.” A bigger grin. 

As Jump Master was adjusting his chest strap and picking up his sunglasses, Which Way and I moved out. Up the trail a few yards, she asked me how it felt. In my 13-year old voice I replied, “It fits like a glove, but I can’t breathe.”

We finished the hike up Rocky Top Mountain which featured some great views from the top. Going up is usually not a problem for Which Way, but coming down is hard on her knees and aggravates the blister on her toe. She had picked up a brace at Rite Aid in the morning for her right knee. She uses K-tape on her left knee. As we started down the mountain, I noticed that her heels never touched the ground as she stepped. It seemed to me, that the lack of a heel strike would create a harder impact on her toes. So, I suggested that she try landing on her heel and pushing off on the ball of her foot. At the bottom of the mountain she reported that her troubled knee and toe felt much better than yesterday. 

Shortly after reaching the bottom of Rocky Top, we began climbing Tray Mountain, about 300’ higher in elevation. We quickly passed the campsite that we had considered stopping at, opting instead to stay at Tray Mountain Shelter, located about 1/4 mile past the peak.  About 3/4's of the way up Tray Mountain we crossed a fire road with a parking lot. And there he was, in all his glory, a Trail Angel (aka Keith). Keith, from a town just NE of Atlanta, had been parked in the same spot since 8AM handing out every sort of goodie, drink, re-supply item a hiker might want/need. We were experiencing our first Trail Magic. So cool. We both practically swallowed a tangerine whole and Which Way scarfed down a bag of chips. I grabbed some pop tarts to go with my oatmeal in the morning and WW took another tangerine to go. Kevin had much more to offer, but we were ready to press on. So we thanked him and continued hiking. But not before he pointed out that there were only 2,134 miles left to Mt. Katahdin.

The trail magic easily fueled us to the top of Tray Mtn. (Elevation 4,398’). As we neared the top of the peak, we passed through a green tunnel of Rhododendrons and Mountain Laurels.  At the summit, Tray Mountain provided the best views we have experienced since our journey began.  A narrow ridge lined with foliage continued for about a quarter of a mile, occasionally opening up to expose mountains and valleys to the north and south. It was breathtaking!

We continued a short distance to an awesome shelter site. There were only two people in the shelter, but we opted for the tent site that offered another remarkable view. We rolled in a little past 4PM and went through our normal routine.

Another hiker, Patty, who started his hike the same day as us and who we have crossed paths with a few times, arrived a bit later. Finally, Jump Master and Grins a Little rolled in about 6PM. He marveled at our tent site, snapping pictures of the view. Since he didn’t comment on it, I assumed he approved of our tent pitching skills. It’s a good thing because I really wasn’t up to taking it down and demonstrating how I set it up for him.

Which Way commented that this was the best hiking day so far. That comes on the heels of her worst day. As I sit under a full moon and bright stars, seeing the lights of Hiawassee in the valley below, it occurs to me that the Appalachian Trail rewards those who persevere. I guess Larry summed it up best, it is a grand adventure!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583619,"The section of the Appalachian Trail that meanders through the North Georgia Mountains is often referred to as “the roller coaster.” It earns its trademark from the continuous rise and fall of the scenic path up and down mountains and knobs. Very few of the 78 miles running from Springer Mtn. to the North Carolina border parallel streams or ride atop ridges. There is also a noticeable absence of switchbacks, which means the trail, more often than not, runs straight up any given mountain, followed by a steep decent down the other side. Alone, none of the mountains we have crossed thus far have presented a challenge beyond what were physically or mentally capable of dealing with. That said, the endless ups and downs for 8 out of 9 days have impressed on us that we are not riding the kiddy coaster.

Our day started on Tray Mountain, where we were up and packed before daylight. We walked 5 meters from our tent, stood on a slab of granite offering an amazing vista and had our very own sunrise worship. What an awesome experience.

The hike started with a long and steep descent down Tray Mountain, followed by the usual ups and downs of the roller coaster. Then came Kelly Knob, treating us to a 1K’ ascent over one mile. On its own, it would be a bit of a challenge, but after 65 miles on the Georgia roller coaster, it left no doubt who the gatekeeper was for this section of the AT. We passed several thru hikers on the way up Kelly Knob (and some of her predecessors) who frankly looked beaten down by the mountains. Seeing hikers gimping along on blistered feet or sitting on the side of the trail with their head down is becoming a daily occurrence. 

Further validating the difficulty of this section of the trail were Day Man and La La, who we met this morning before climbing Kelly’s Knob. The duo were hiking the AT with a goal of completing their third leg of the Triple Crown of hiking. They had already completed the first two legs—The Pacific Crest Trail and the Continental Divide Trail.  Both the PCT and CDT are longer and have higher elevations than the AT. When I asked how the AT compared so far, they did not hesitate in answering that the AT was the toughest due to the constant ups and downs and rocky terrain, both of which prevent hikers from getting into a good rhythm. 

We also passed a southbound day hiker, Coop, who had completed a SOBO in 2003, at the age of 55 (my age). He asked us if we were thru hikers. When we indicated that we were, he reached in his pocket and handed us several Starburst. We got a picture of Coop and his dog, ate one of the Starburst, and put the others in our pockets where they remained until we needed a little extra umph to get up and over a mountain. Our pockets were empty by the end of the day.

We decided around noon that we were going to hike to Dicks Creek Gap and stay at the renowned Top of Georgia (TOG) Hostel, so when I got a decent signal I called to make reservations. Included with the reservation were two bunks, a shower, laundry service, and a shuttle ride to Hiawassee (food and re-supply). The shuttle to Hiawassee would depart at 4PM.  It was noon when I made the reservation and we had six more miles to hike to Dicks Creek Gap. I figured if we averaged our typical two miles an hour, we could make it by 3PM, giving us enough time for a quick shower before catching the shuttle. Of course, that was before we realized that Kelly’s Knob presented a formidable obstacle. Nonetheless, we somehow managed to trudge up the Knob and survive the steep trek down, making it to Dick’s Creek Gap at about 2:45. Plot twist! The TOG was yet another 1/2 mile down a curvy 2-lane Highway. Sensing that Which Way was at the end of her hiking rope, I raced ahead of her when we were about 1/4 mile from a parking lot at Dick’s Creek Gap. When I arrived I saw a man in a black pickup truck who was trying to wiggle his way into a tight parking spot, so I offered to guide him into the spot. He said “thanks” and I said, “Too bad you were coming and not going or I would have hit you up for a ride to the TOG.” He replied, ""I’ll be glad to take you anyway.” ANOTHER TRAIL ANGEL, showing up at the perfect moment. The trail will provide!

About that time, Which Way stumbled across the road, looking like she had been hit by a Mack Truck. I motioned her over, letting her know that the nice gentleman was going to give us a lift to the TOG. She replied, “You are my hero!” Music to my ears. On the short ride down, the man (Jeff) told us he too was a Hostel owner. Turns out, Jeff is the proprietor of the Green Mountain House in Manchester Vermont, another “must stay” AT hostel.  Jeff had come down to Georgia for the official 2018 AT kickoff. He had just came from Amicalola Falls and reported that 50 hikers had started their hike today. I sure hope we are able to stay ahead of that bubble.

Once at the TOG, we got a quick shower and I picked up a re-supply package I had mailed to this address the day before we started our AT journey. 

We were shuttled into Hiawassee by a nice gal named Grace and dropped off at the town Mexican restaurant. Doug and Spirit Man, who both started their journey a couple of days before us, joined us at a booth. I ordered the Hombre Grande and finished every bite. Halfway through the meal in walked the Dynamic Duo (blind man and his wife from day 1). They were coming in from Unicoi Gap (two days back). She said they had skipped Blood Mtn because it was raining hard they day they planned to take it on. It is really neat how the trail keeps bringing hikers together.

If all goes well tomorrow, we will bid farewell to the roller coaster and end the day in North Carolina. 

Much more to write about, but I’m fading fast. Happy Trails! NS

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583671,"Sweet Caroline
 
Sweet Caroline, ba ba ba, good times never seemed so good! I’m a classic rock fan, but today I was digging me some Neill Diamond. “Sweet Caroline” seemed the perfect song to sing as we reached the GA / NC border at Bly Gap. 

The day started with all-you-can-eat cold cereal at the TOG. That was a bit of a letdown after all of the journal entries I had read over the years touting the amazing breakfast in the TOG. We caught the first shuttle back to Dick’s Creek Gap and started our hike out of Georgia at 8:45AM. The temperature hovered around 50 all day, there was little to no wind, and the sun cast a soft yellow glow though a thin layer of clouds. There is something calming about hiking through the forest and only hearing the sound of your feet striking the ground keeping cadence with your heavy breathing. 
Terrain wise, we picked up today where left off yesterday, on the Georgia roller coaster. Although the grade was not as steep, Which Way’s pinky toe was screaming for her to stop after the first descent.  We stopped to diagnose and try to remedy the little nuisance before it became a big problem. She removed her shoes and socks and we quickly assessed where the friction was originating. The rub (pun intended) appeared to be that her little toe folds under the adjacent digit, creating contact and friction with every step. It appears that Which Way wears her name from her head to her feet, as her toes point in every which direction. We taped the two toes together with leukeo tape and applied a big glob of Vaseline to the area. This field remedy procedure would get her through the day. 

As we were taking care of the weakest link, Doug and then Spirit Man passed us by. We leapfrogged with them throughout the morning. We came upon the two of them sharing a log and eating their lunch. Doug informed us that he finally had a trail name, Near Miss. Apparently a few days back, as he worked his way up Tray Mtn., he paused for a second, bending over his hiking poles to catch his breath. Just as he did, a huge branch fell 20’ from a tree and crashed onto the trail 10 yards from where he stopped—Near Miss! After listening to his frightful story, we continued up the trail. We did not see Spirit Man or Near Miss on the trail for the rest of the day. 

Shortly after passing our new trail friends we found a log of our own to picnic on. After scarfing down a tuna wrap and a snack we knocked out a couple of mini-trail coasters. Then we crossed a small fire road at Blue Ridge Gap. As we re-entered the woods, a sign welcomed us to the Southern Nantahala Wilderness Area of the Chattahoochee National Forest.  Another sign indicated that we were 3.1 miles from Bly Gap (and NC). There was a visible change to the surrounding forest as soon as we entered the Nantahala Wilderness Area. We were in an old growth forest with an assortment of trees, each with a good amount of real estate between trees allowing for plenty of room to survive and thrive. Small fir trees now mixed in with the Rhododendrons and Mountain Laurels to add splashes of green to the scenery.  The forest floor (and the trail) also softened, with less rocks to navigate over.  Although we climbed 1,000’ from Blue Ridge Gap to Bly Gap, it was not a difficult hike. The trail gained 200-300 feet in elevation and then came down a 100 feet or so, giving our legs and lungs a break between climbs.

We were ready to have our first of fourteen states behind us and the anticipation built as we drew closer to Bly Gap. If Which Way had not been leading the way, I probably would have sprinted the last half mile. When we finally hit the state line, a faded marker posted on a tree marked the event. What, no welcome center?! You might say that the crossing of state lines was a little anti-climactic. But, that didn’t stop us from celebrating. We shot a little video that I will try to add to our journal later.

Less than 100 meters from the state line was a small campsite. We were the first to arrive, followed by Near Miss, Spirit Man and 6-8 other hikers. Among the group was Smoking Joe (he rolled his own) who started his thru hike on 13 February. We passed him and his buddy laying in the middle of the trail earlier in the day. He said he was in no hurry. That’s an understatement. He seemed happy just to be here and that is what matters.

Near Miss pitched his tent right next to ours and we ate dinner together. I kept calling him “Close Call” instead of Near Miss. He must have liked Close Call better, because, as we were retiring to our tents, he announced, “Close Call it is.” He then texted his wife, apparently making it official.

It is sweet to be in NC, but I have fond memories of the A.T. in Georgia—Springer, Blood, Tray, Mountain Crossings, Blairsville, Hiawassee, the TOG Hostel, and of course, all our new friends. A big shout out to the Georgia Appalachian Trail Club and host of other volunteers who manage the trail in Georgia. GO DAWGS!

It is starting to rain now. More of the liquid sunshine and much colder temps in the forecast. Please keep us in your thoughts and prayers as we work our way towards Franklin; and a much needed ZERO!

It never rains in Carolina. Wait, wrong song, wrong State! 

Showers persisted through the night, but the steady rain waited until daybreak to rear its ugly head. Perfect! It’s one thing to hike in the rain. Rolling out of the tent, preparing breakfast, and packing wet gear substantially cranks up the degree of difficulty. We thought we could wait the wet stuff out, or at least catch a break so that we could eat and pack up our gear. We finally submitted and did all of the morning chores in the rain. Finally departing at 10AM, we were the second and third hikers out of the tent site. Only Spirit Man made it out sooner. Other than Close Call, who was packing up his tent when I took off, no one else remaining at camp appeared to be going anywhere anytime soon.

Which Way took off a few minutes before me while I stowed the rain-drenched tent. Of course, I pointed her in the right direction first.  Passing the iconic Gnarled Tree within 50 meters of hitting the trail (sorry no pics in the heavy rain) we immediately started an 800’ climb to an elevation of 4,600’.  This was the first climb on the AT that made my calves moo!  After climbing in the pouring rain for several minutes, I still did not have Which Way in sight. At the top of the first peak I came upon a blue blaze trail. Still no sign of Which Way, so I gave the whistle on my chest strap one hard blow. A second later came the return whistle from Which Way—music to my ears.  A minute later I caught a glimpse of her through the mist and would soon take up my hiking position just behind her. It wasn’t too much later that we passed by Spirit Man.

About 2.5 miles into our hike we came to Muskrat Shelter. We stopped at a stream just before the shelter and filtered water. Muskrat is a very nice shelter with two picnic tables under awning, and out of the rain. When we arrived there was one hiker (Storage Unit) sitting up in his sleeping bag in one corner of the shelter. I asked if he had just showed up or had been there all morning. He replied, “I don’t hike in the rain anymore. “  As it turned out, he started the trail on 12 February.  We must be doing something wrong.

Out of the rain, but still wet and cold, we decided to have our hot dinner for lunch. Spirit Man and Close Call showed up a little later and did the same.  We hit the privy and did some stretching while we waited for our dehydrated meal to be ready to eat. In the meantime, a father-son pair rolled in. They would be staying at Muskrat for the night. Soon after, Zoltan came in out of the rain. He told us that he had been hiking with Heartburn. 

We departed the Muskrat around 1PM, making a run for Standing Indian Shelter, another 5 miles up the trail. The rain was still coming down when we left. To further dampen the mood, Which Way’s right knee started acting up again. We needed a ray of sunshine, and fast. The trail does provide--we got what we needed!  By 2PM the rain stopped and the sun soon began to peek through the waning clouds—a Godsend! Over the two miles remaining in our hike, our rain gear and shirts dried out for the most part.  WW’s knee also stopped hurting with that dose of sunshine.

We arrived at Standing Indian Shelter around 3:30PM. Only one hiker (Gazelle) was there when we arrived. She had passed us on the trail shortly after we departed Muskrat Shelter. Yes, she was moving like a Gazelle.

We decided to claim two spots in the seven person shelter. We then went about our normal post-hike routine, with the added tasks of hanging our sopping wet tent and other gear out to dry. That will drop my pack weight by about 5 pounds.

Close Call, followed by Spirit Man, showed up a bit later and pitched their tents. Three or four other hikers from Gazelle’s bubble would eventually show, including Willow (from Germany) and Nomad (an Aussie). They indicated that the hike wasn’t anything like the one depicted in the brochure. I guess they should have read Model-T’s book.

Another half dozen or so hikers showed up and scattered to the tent sites surrounding the shelter. Which Way and I are sleeping inside the shelter for the first time. We are currently packed in like sardines, warm and DRY!

Although it rained today and we were presented with our share of daily challenges, the scenery was beautiful and there is no place I’d rather be than on the A.T. with my Sheesh (Which Way).

P.S. We have received several guest book entries offering concern and advice for Which Way’s toe blister. The most common recommendation is Injjinji liners/socks. She has a pair of each, but had to remove them on the problem foot when we taped the toes together. Once it heals she will likely go back to toe socks with some lukueo tape around the pinky toe for good measure. Thank you for your concern. It means a lot to us.

",Standing Indian Shelter,"Mar 06, Tue",7.70
Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583771,"It is 6:30PM and Which Way and I are in our tent, layered up with nearly every article of clothing we have. When the sun sets behind the mountains we anticipate the temperature will drop to below 20 degrees. 
Our day began at Standing Indian Shelter, where we survived our first night actually sleeping in the shelter, rather than our tent. We shared the shelter floor with Gazelle, Willow, Nomad, and Tom (just Tom).  The youngest of the group is Willow, at 19.  Gazelle and Tom looked to be in their 20’s . Nomad was the older one of the four, pushing 40. Collectively, they are a nice group of young adults. The four of them have been putting in big miles, with Gazelle out front. It is my humble assessment that the others are laboring to keep up with Gazelle. The three lumbered into camp last night a good 90 minutes after she arrived. It was apparent that Tom was especially bedraggled from the hike and dismayed with the weather conditions. He commented about his clothes and gear being wet, so I suggested that he hang his stuff out to dry before the temperatures dropped.  

The wind picked up in intensity throughout the night, rushing in a blast of much colder air. The shelter was drafty and cold. As day broke, Mother Nature rung out what little moisture was in the air and light snow quickly covered the frozen ground. Gazelle was up quickly and informing the rest of the group that the today’s target was Long Branch Shelter, over 14 miles up the trail. As the others packed their gear, following Gazelle’s lead, Tom was harping on the direness of the situation. As the others bolted out, Tom lingered and languished. By now, Close Call and Spirit Man had made their way from their tent site to the shelter. Close Call asked us our plan and I told him we would try to make it to Betty’s Creek Campsite, a distance of 11 miles. However, we would assess the situation at Carter’s Shelter, approximately 7 miles into the hike. He and Spirit Man said they would do the same. Tom, now 30 minutes behind his group, continued to obsess on the severity of the weather and what a bad idea it was to be out here. Although, he was from Colorado, he was clearly surprised by, and unprepared for the weather. Realizing that we were the last one’s remaining at the site and concerned about Tom’s mental well-being and safety, our attention turned to him. We tried to encourage him to start moving and that he would warm up with the 1,000’ ascent up Standing Indian Mountain. “But my hands are cold,” replied Tom. We had crossed a fire road less than a mile before hitting camp last night, so I asked Tom if he wanted us to get him a ride out of there. His timid response was” yes.” Close Call quickly got Ron Brown on the phone. Ron, a shuttle driver and AT guru from Georgia, informed him the Forest Road was closed for the winter, with a gate blocking the entrance. The only option from the egress point would be to call 911. Tom did not want to do that. We told him that we were not going to leave him at the shelter alone, hypothermia being our biggest concern. As he stood there in the cold, ringing his pasty white hands, I asked him where his gloves were. He nodded to the opening of the shelter, where his only pair of gloves, still soaked from yesterday’s hike, lay next to his skimpy pack. Which Way grabbed his hands in hers and tried to warm them. I had just put on a pair of Marmot gloves, that I was wearing for the first time since starting at Springer.  “Here, take these,” I said to Tom. He slipped the warm gloves on and said, “Oh, these feel good.” We pointed him the way to the trail and told him to get moving before we all froze to death. Close Call headed out next, followed by Which Way, me and then Spirit Man. 

About half way up the mountain, one foot began to thaw under our still frozen shoes. A little further, the numbness subsided in the other foot. Before long we were shedding layers on this blustery day. My fingertips remained numb the rest of the morning under my Smartwool liners and REI nylon mittens. The skies eventually cleared, but the temperature remained below freezing the remainder of the day. The hoses on our hydration system were frozen solid, so we had to pause frequently to drink from our 500ml Nalgene bottle, which we refilled from our hydration system bladder.  The bottles would quickly ice up too, so we stored them upside down in our packs to keep the lids from freezing. 

Which Way and I hiked alone all morning, not seeing any other hikers until we stopped for lunch in the vicinity of Carter Gap Shelter. Close Call came out of the shelter and handed me my Marmots. He said that Tom was doing better and was pressing on to Rock Gap, where he would end his hike. I wonder if Tom’s hike would have ended today if he had simply hiked his own hike (lower miles) and been a little more prepared—gear and psyche.

The remainder of the hike was great. My hands were warm inside my Marmots, the terrain was relatively easy, and the scenery was gorgeous. We arrived at Betty’s Creek at 3:30, where we found Close Call sitting on a log, pack on his back. “Bad news, the site is closed to campers due to land restoration,” he said as he motioned to a sign posted on a tree. We ended up hiking another mile before we found a “not so stealth” site just off the trail. Spirit Man lumbered in about 45 mins later.

",Mooney Gap,"Mar 07, Wed",12
Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583820,"I woke up little before sunrise and rolled over to give Which Way a kiss on the cheek. I missed and got her feet instead. What, how did they get up here? Turns out that our impromptu tent site was not exactly level and all of the blood was rushing to her head, so she switched ends sometime during the night. 

I slept like a rock last night until I got my usual five hours in—at midnight. WW was still awake when I woke up and reported to me that my snoring was keeping her up. According to her, my snoring was something like I was blowing air into my sleeping matt. She soon got to sleep and I stayed up a few more hours working on yesterday’s journal. The trouble I go through for our readers—lol. 

Eventually I nodded back off and slept until around 6AM. After kissing WW’s feet, I let the air out of my Therm-a-rest NeoAir XTherm sleeping pad (worth every penny), put my EE Revelation 950-Fill Down Quilt (keeps me cozy and warm and weighs a whopping 19oz), and gave the cross pole of my Big Agnus Cooper Spur-2 Tent (light and gets the job done) a good shake, sending powder snow down the sides of the tent fly. It was a whopping 19 degrees when we woke up, but the sun was shining and the winds were light. I quickly went to fetch the bear bag from a nearby tree. I had problems getting the excess line tied off last night, so the nylon cord ended up in a knot. If it had been 40 degrees I may have spent more time trying to work the knot out. But, with my fingertips still numb from hiking yesterday in sub-freezing conditions, I quickly turned to Plan B—cut the line.  I boiled some water to make oatmeal and coffee for me and buttered grits and hot cocoa for WW. The only adequate place to operate the MSR Pocket Rocket stove, was on the trail, a mere 3 feet from where our tent was pitched. Like I said, “not so stealth” camping. Wanting to get our hike started (and our bodies warmed up), we wasted no time scarfing down our hot breakfast, taking down the tent and packing up the rest of the gear. 

Close to 8:30AM I pointed WW in the right direction and sent her on her way as I finished packing up the tent. As I hiked alone, I meditated on how content I was to be hiking on this cold morning, breathing in the crisp mountain air, with the morning sun warming my face, the frozen trail under my feet, and the absolute wonder of God’s creation all around me. From the little ice needles shooting up from the earth, still a little warmer than the air, to the icicles hanging from rock walls; to cool springs gurgling out of the side of the mountain; to moss covered trees that stood strong and reached to the sky; to the leaves on the Rhododendrons that, in self-preservation mode, hung vertically from branches in the frigid temps, like bats hanging from the ceiling of a cave. As I was taking it all in, I saw WW ahead standing in the middle of the trail, facing to the east.

As I got closer I realized she was singing. A few feet away I recognized the tune, “I Stand in Awe of You” and I joined in for a few words until I came to her side and looked to the east with her. Then my voice just cracked. It is futile for me to try to capture in words the majestic view before us, in that moment. The picture I snapped from my I-phone does not even come close to capturing the moment and the view. The scenery painted on the canvass before us was by far, the most awe-inspiring sight we had seen since we started our trek. 

After taking in the moment a bit longer, we continued what would be a 2.5 mile climb to the top of Albert Mtn. I stopped a moment later to retrieve some water from a spring. My filter and hydration system frozen, I filled two 1-liter Platypus bladders with the cold water. Although the water, literally coming from the side of the mountain, is cleaner, and certainly purer, than what comes from your tap, I threw in an Aqua Tab water purifier for good measure. 

By the time I caught up with WW again, the terrain was getting much steeper. We paused for a quick drink and snack, shortened our hiking poles to compensate for grade, and shed our OR Helium II Rain Jackets (really more effective as a wind breaker). Shortly after continuing our hike, we found ourselves in a semi-rock scramble to the top. Careful to avoid icy spots, we were standing atop Albert Mtn. in no time. Peaking out at 5,213’, it was about 200 feet shorter than Standing Indian Mtn., but much more majestic. There is a 200’ fire tower at the top of Albert. We passed on the climb, focusing our attention now on the next milestone, just a half mile ahead.

Just as we departed Albert Mtn. a light snow began to fall and would continue for the rest of the hike.  We quickly reached Big Spring Gap, where we commenced in doing our version of the hillbilly hoedown. Why? Because we had completed our first 100 miles of the AT! The location was marked by sticks under the Big Spring Gap sign, spelling out “100.” 

No time to relish in our mini-victory, our next goal lay just 5 miles ahead at Rock Gap, our exit point to our second Zero Day. Which Way was out front, moving as quickly as she could on her bum knee, we made good time on our final approach. When it comes to the end of a hike, I liken WW to a trail horse when it turns for home and “smells the barn,” she is all about getting there. Sometimes I think her trail name should be “Barn Sniffer.” 

We arrived at the parking area at Rock Gap around 12:30, where Al and Susie were waiting to greet us. Who are Susie and Al, you ask? Don’t know, we just met them. Allow me to explain. Susie had been following us through our trail journal and reached out to us before we started our trek, offering us a ride and place to stay during our ZERO. One of my mantras is “never deny a person an opportunity to do good.” So, we said yes! But, we wondered, what we were getting ourselves into? Would they have a dozen cats in their house (don’t be offended cat lovers; WW is allergic to cat hair, that’s all)? Worse yet, would they be mass murderers? Wait, I’ve been sleeping in the wild with the bears and the freezing temps. What is there to fear? 

As it turns out, absolutely nothing! We could see our chariot awaiting through the sparse forest as we took the final turn on the switchback. Susie was out of their vehicle asking Close Call, who beat us to the parking lot, if he knew Which Way and Next Step. Close Call was undoubtedly assessing the situation that we were about to walk into. A former firefighter and EMT, he is cautious by nature and instinctively aware of the environment around him. Those skills and the fact that he is such a likable guy have made him great to hike/camp with over the past few days.

Anyway, CC relayed that he knew us and told her that we were close on his heels. He looked over his shoulder, seeing us approach, and said here they come now. We quickly exchanged hugs with Susie and fist bumps with Al (not the hugging type). We loaded our gear in the back of their SUV and climbed in the backseat, where drinks (a Coke Zero for WW) and snacks awaited us. Susie and Al live in Sky Valley, GA, just south of the NC-GA state line. In route to their place, a beautiful and cozy home in the mountains, they graciously dropped us by the Wendy’s in Franklin, where we practically shallowed a single, fries, and chili (for me) whole. Turns out, that was just an appetizer. Susie made us a homemade pizza with our favorite toppings. We cleaned our gear, took hot showers, and started laundry as the pizza cooked. Oh, chocolate cookies and milk following the pizza! And, wait, wait, lasagna for dinner. They treated like royalty and made us feel right at home. We immediately hit it off. Susie readily laughed at all my corny one liners and Al and I were bantering in no time. At one time he threatened to put me on the back porch (with a beautiful view by the way) and let Which Way sleep inside. Susie is a retired school teacher and Al is retired from law enforcement and a current City Councilman.

I was somehow relieved to know that he had “done a little investigating on us.” 

Oh and the bed, so comfortable. I could go on and on and on...

it amazing how God sends you just what you need, just when you need it? Our
Trail Angels, Susie and Al, have given us the PERFECT DAY!!!! It was honestly
better than anything I could have imagined!!
We
started the day with a bread pudding and fruit (uh, Amazing.) We all got ready
and headed out for some resupply and sightseeing. They live in a cozy mountain
house, nestled in Pleasant Mountain (Seriously, someone pinch me because this
must just be a dream!!!) They drove us around their neighborhood which has just
one incredible view after another. Then before heading into Franklin, we
stopped by a breathtaking waterfall which provided the perfect backdrop for a
group photo:-) The next stop was the outfitter, Outdoor 76 to get some supplies
and pick up our bounce box. Susie was shopping for some new hiking shoes and
Outdoor 76 is THE PLACE to get them! They are absolute experts on feet and will
spend as much time as necessary to make sure you walk out with the best shoes
for you. The salesman finally (2 hours later) let her settle on a pair and
we were on our way to the post office to bounce our box on up the trail a
couple of weeks. Then we headed to Wally World to get our food for the next
three days of hiking. I kept apologizing for all the places we needed to go and
Al said over and over again that they really didn’t mind at all and that I must
be a slow learner since I felt the need to keep apologizing. Lol I’m figuring
out that I am not very good at receiving help from others. That is not a good
trait, especially since I preach to my parents all the time that it’s okay to
let other people help you! That’s something I will definitely try to work on
while I’m on the trail! 
We finally finished all of our errands and then we headed to Highlands, which
is an adorable little town with lots of shops and eateries. We had a late
lunch/early supper at The Ugly Dog and I chose the shrimp po’boy sandwich. YUM!
And just when I thought the day couldn’t get any better, Susie suggested we go
down the street for some Kilwins’ ice cream. Oh. My. 
We got back to their house and got right to work repacking so we can be ready
to go first thing in the morning. Now I’m sitting in the recliner with my feet
up and ice on my knee, hoping that the day off has been just what I need to
heal up. I am sure it’s what my heart and soul needed, and for that I can
only say THANK YOU to our new forever friends, Susie and Al. I am sure that
anyone that was listening in on our conversation probably thought we had known
each other for many years. And when they listened to Next Step and Al banter
back and forth, they would never guess we had only met the day before. What a
blessing that our paths crossed and we will look to forward to future visits
when we finish our hike, at their place or ours (wherever that may be). - Which

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583901,"Our Trail Angels returned us to Rock Gap at 9AM, bellies filled with bacon, eggs, toast, and fresh fruit. The two primary launch points from the A.T. to Franklin are Rock Gap (mile 105.6) and Winding Stair Gap (mile 109.2).  From the parking area Al and Susie walked a little over a mile north on the A.T. with us. Then Al doubled back to the vehicle and relocated to Winding Stair Gap, as Susie continued hiking this section with us.

When we began our hike, the conditions were perfect —partly sunny, calm, and temps in the mid-40s. This section of the trail was hit hard during the fires that ravished the area in 2016.  The forest was nut brown, with sparse undergrowth, and was full of the remnants of charred trees. However, the resilience of nature was evident, as life was winning the battle over death and destruction.  

We passed another hiker, Slosh, along the way. Slosh, a 60ish free-spirit, started her trek on Valentine’s Day. Another young couple, Eddie and Kat, would pass us just before we hit the Winding Stair Gap. Al had walked south from there, meeting us about a 1/2 mile out. When we hit the parking lot, it was time to say so long to our new friends. We gave Susie and Al a big hug (yes, Al too) and watched as they offered a young hiker named Josh a ride to Franklin. Wisely, Josh accepted their generosity. Good move!

Which Way and I crossed US 64 and, shortly after slipping into the woods, came to a nice waterfall, where we paused for a snack and did our morning stretches. We took a quick look at Guthook’s AT Guide App, and saw that it was a steady ascent over 3.7 miles to the blue blaze trail leading to Siler Bald Shelter and then another 1/2 mile to the shelter. What? That is less than 8 miles total for the day. Yep! We have decided to slow our roll for a while to give WW’s knee a chance to heal. Since we are in this thing to win it, we have to play the long game. Marathoners will tell you that you can’t win the race in the first mile, but you can lose it in the first mile. I liken that to the A.T., we can’t make it to Katahdin in the first month, but we can lose our dream in the first month if we don’t listen to our bodies and take what the trail gives us. 

We came out of our break in short sleeves, not wanting to overheat during the long climb. As we gained elevation, the weather began to shift. The air cooled and clouds began to envelop the nearby mountains, incessantly marching our way. Our hands feeling the bite of the cool moist air, we donned our hiking gloves, pressing on in hopes of getting to the shelter before the inevitable rain started. The forecast showed rain moving in today and continuing through Monday, mixing in with snow at times. 

After an easy hike for us and PAIN FREE day for Which Way, we glided into the shelter at 1:30PM. Surely there would be two spots available. No joy! The shelter was already full with a group of folks who had apparently been communing together for some time. On the bright side, the rain held off until after we pitched our tent, on not so level ground. After a quick lunch at the shelter and a trip to a near-by stream to filter water, we retreated to our tent, where we took a shivery nap beneath the cold damp air.

We woke up around 5PM with the chill still in our bones. The rain receded long enough for us to cook dinner and finish our remaining hiker chores. With our tummies full and bones feeling a little warmer, we have retreated to our tent for the night. Now the wind is picking up and the rain is once again pelting the outer wall. Nonetheless, we are warm, dry, content and living in the moment. The adverse weather that awaits us tomorrow can just wait a little longer. - Next Step

",Siler Bald Shelter,"Mar 10, Sat",8.10
Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583943,"When our kiddos were small I used to read them a book called “Sweet Surprises”. That is the first thing that came to mind when we awoke this morning. Even though it was raining, we definitely had not gotten the 1/2 - 3/4 inches of rain during the night that had been forecasted. We got up and packed our backpacks inside the tent and then headed up to the shelter to make some breakfast.  By the time we finished eating, the rain had stopped, so we decided to get the tent down and start hiking. Next Step was relieved to see that the rain fly was the only thing that was really wet. Most of the hikers decided to stay in the shelter for the day because they didn’t want to hike in the rain?!? Sounds great on paper, but not sure that I could make it to Katahdin before the park closes for the winter if I only hike on the sunny days. 
 Fortunately for us that lead to sweet surprise #2, as we kept hiking thru the fog, we keep waiting for the downpour that was forecast for today, but it never happened! We hiked the entire way from Siler Bald Shelter to Wayah Bald Shelter without a drop! We stopped off after the first big descent for a stretch break and a snack. Since the weather was still cooperating, we decided that a log would be the perfect place for our worship today. So much to be thankful for!!!! We continued on and hit a 1000’ ascent followed by a pretty good descent through a mud pit. And for those of you who know me, you know how much I LOVE the mud!!! NOT!!! But that’s ok, at least the air was dry and the winds were very calm. As we topped the Wayah Bald we were wishing it had been a clear day because we were sure there would be an amazing view. And that lead to sweet surprise #3. By the time I could walk up to the public restroom near the tower, the fog cleared and there was the amazing view!!! It was there, also, that we had seen the most remnants from the fires from 2016 as all the wooden sections of the tower had been replaced. We met Glyph, from Wales, and Switch at the tower and they indicated they were staying at the same shelter as us, which was less than 2 miles from the tower. We were hoping to stay in the shelter since the forecast was calling for more rain tonight and rain/snow in the morning. Since we are heading to the Nanatahala Lodge tomorrow, we would like to get up and get going and not have to pack up our tent. And that lead to sweet surprise # 4.
We arrived at the shelter which was brand new and we were the first ones there, so we actually have two spots in the shelter!!! Glyph and Switch have never stayed in a shelter before, so they decided to stay with us, for the same reasons. We got back from filtering water to find Crafty, our other bunk mate for the night. Getting ready to heat up some chili mac with beef and I’m just going to pretend it tastes like Susie’s amazing lasagna!!! Only had a few twinges from the knee today. Just enough to remind me that I should keep taking it easy for a few more days!! Feeling very blessed and am looking forward to any more sweet surprises that show up before my head hits the pillow.
 Hugs!--Which Way

",Wayah Bald Shelter,"Mar 11, Sun",7.30
Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584006,"Gandal, the final hiker from Glyph, Switch, and Crafty’s group, joined us in the Wayah Shelter last night, making us a cozy six. The rain set in just as we were all getting comfy in our sleeping bags and the lights went out (sunset that is). The rain continued through the night, changing over to snow just before sunrise. At 6:00, I was the first to brave the elements, as I used the red light on my headlamp to find my way up a hill behind our shelter, where our food bags were hanging from a pine tree. By 8:00 Which Way and I were meandering down the snow covered trail with a belly full of grits. 

It snowed on and off all day and the fog ebbed and flowed with the wind and contour of the terrain. About halfway into the hike we stopped to grab a snack and Glyph passed us by. Not much further down the trail we came upon her as she was finishing up a break of her own. She was donning her pack using the technique she learned from us yesterday at Wayah Bald. 
Overjoyed with her newfound discovery, she proclaimed that it was much more efficient and caused less torque on her spine than the traditional method of slinging the pack across her back. She had already taught her hiking companions the new technique. Could this be the start of a new trend? 
Glyph and the fast-moving Switch both passed us for a final time as we worked our way up Cooper Ridge Bald and Rocky Bald. At the top of Rocky Bald I called the Nantahala Mountain Lodge and asked that they send a shuttle to Tellico Gap, just 1.5 miles away. I had made reservations at the lodge two nights earlier after seeing that a potential Winter Storm was brewing. Maggie, a British gal, dispatched her hubby, Steve (a.k.a. Wiggle) to meet us at 12:30. 

Unfortunately, Which Way’s knee was giving her problems again today, making the descents painful for her and slow for both of us. The hardest part of the journey for me thus far has been seeing the frustration brewing in her, as an otherwise great experience is constantly blunted by the attention she is diverting to pain and discomfort. While we are well aware that AT hikers are predisposed to some level of pain and agony, it sure would be nice if this burden could be lifted from her. I would gladly take on her pain so that she could fully enjoy this experience without distraction.
 Speaking of distractions, as we were descending the final 1.5 miles to Tellico Gap, a 14 percent grade, WW started singing songs to help deflect her attention away from the pain in her knee. I had sent her ahead when I made the phone call and when I caught up with her I joined in. When we were about 1/2 way down, Gandal slipped up behind us and seemed to approve of our diversionary tactics. 
Shortly after getting to Tellico Gap Steve arrived in a Subaru and we piled in. It was about a 20 minute drive to the lodge, during which time we learned that Steve was a retired British Special Service Forces Soldier and a former AT Thru Hiker. He told us that Maggie, his wife, a former British Intelligence Officer, ran a tight ship and if we just followed her instructions everything would go smoothly. When we arrived, Maggie, with her hands ion her hips, was positioned outside the lodge, where she sort of greeted us. After we grabbed out gear she immediately escorted us to a shed-sized building just outside the main lodge. There was a sign outside the door that read “Mud Room”.  We entered the room with the short, but confident, Maggie on our heels. Once inside, she informed us that all of our gear and clothes would remain in the Mud Room. “Now, start taking off the stuff you want washed and put it in here,” she said as she extended a grocery bag sized basket. We began shedding layers, wondering just how far this would go. Just when it was about to get awkward, Maggie, apparently satisfied that we did not have cooties or were not Russian spies, said, “That’s enough, you can take off the rest before you get in the shower (making it clear that showers would commence immediately).” She then marched us inside the very nice lodge and up to our lovely king size room. “Put the rest of your clothes in the bag and bring them down to the dining area when you are done showering. Oh, and you can wear these while you wait for your clothes to be laundered,” Maggie instructed as she pointed to our loaner sweats and shirt. “Your pizza will be ready when you come down stairs.” Just when I was about to object to not being issued undergarments with our new wardrobe, she had to mention pizza. Shucks, we would have come down in all of our glory for pizza! 

 Of course the shower was great and the pizza was better. We saw one other Thru Hiker, Slosh, and two pairs of section hikers at the lodge. I know I had a little fun at Maggie’s expense, but the place is really very nice and she and Steve are a good team. I guess I would run a tight ship too, knowing that some hikers wear their filth and stink like a badge of honor.
We will keep a close eye on the forecast, but it looks like tomorrow it will be dry and cold for our steep drop down to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC). Perhaps I can talk WW into shifting some weight to my pack in an effort to minimize the impact to her knee. 
For now, we are warm, dry, and CLEAN in our king size bed!

",Teleco Gap - Nantahala Mountain Lodge,"Mar 12, Mon",8.40
Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584092,"The day started with seven hungry hikers packed around a tiny dining table. It was time for Maggie’s Deluxe Breakfast—a small slice of breakfast casserole (quite yummy), one silver dollar pancake, four tater tots,  1.5 cups of coffee, and all you can drink tap water. Uhh, did we somehow get confused with a Girl Scout Troop? In less than three minutes all seven plates were licked clean and six of the seven (still hungry) hikers were scurrying out the lodge door, where two vehicles were waiting to shuttle hikers to various drop off points. The other thru hiker in the group, Slosh, was taking a zero. K2 and Hiker Doo, the couple from Austin, were shuttled to Burningstown Gap (5 AT miles south of Tellico Gap.) in the second vehicle. 

Riding with us to Tellico Gap were Jingle and Bells, two section hikers from Georgia. From Tellico Gap they headed south on the AT for a 3-day trek. The friendly gals would launch out in different directions for a few days at a time, using the lodge as a base camp. Wiggly easily navigated the mountain roads to Tellico Gap. It was 9:00 and a crisp 24 degrees when he dropped us off. 
We started our hike with a moderate climb up Wesser Bald. The day was sunny, cold, and a bit breezy.  The frozen tundra under our feet was a nice substitute for the mucky stuff we had been hiking in for the last few days. At the top of Wesser stood a fire tower. We dropped our packs and climbed 44 steps to the top, where we were rewarded with an amazing panoramic view. Gazing north we could make out Fontana Lake and the Great Smoky Mountains. 
Invigorated, we scampered down the tower stairs, did our morning stretches (with muscles warm from the hike up Wesser), shared some pita and hummus, and continued our hike. For the next couple of miles the trail primarily followed a ridge line, traversing several large ravines where the fire of 2016 did extensive damage. The black scars that marked several mountainsides resembled huge swaths of cloud born shadows. Eventually, we came to a rock outcropping, listed as the “Jump Off Point” in AWOLs AT Guidebook. A day hiker offered to snap a picture of us. This spot on the trail marked the beginning of the 4.5 mile descent to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC). Over the years I have read accounts of other hikers making the 4.5 miles descent to the iconic NOC. Long envisioning myself making that same trek, today I was alive in my dream. 
Before we started our hike down we fixed up a couple of P&J wraps (thanks for the J Maggie) and I convinced Which Way into shifting some of her gear to my pack. She also popped an 800mg Motrin in an effort to stay ahead of the pending knee pain. She then diligently employed a downhill hiking technique that Hiker Doo shared the night before—center of gravity awareness, using full foot arch, a short gate, and traversing the trail (vs walking the center line). 
The first 1/2 mile or so from the top was quite steep and included some sizable step downs. This section of the trail hugged a narrow spine with significant drops on either side. But after the initial challenge, the trail essentially switch-backed its way down the remaining four miles. There were even some small inclines and flats thrown in along the way, offering brief respites from the steady decline. The bright sun began to warm the air around us and the ground softened. Our fingers finally thawed too and we eventually removed our jackets. Halfway down, still no knee pain for WW...three quarters, no pain. A mile out, the excitement builds, and she begins picking up the pace, so I reminded her, “don’t break form...” Now we could hear the roar of the Nantahala River, then cars traveling along the paved road now in sight, still no pain. We could now see the NOC below through the winter forest. One final switchback, still no pain. We crossed the two lane highway and dropped our packs at the General Store. No pain! Another milestone reached and a victory on many levels.
The NOC is a commercial outdoor guide service and retail store. It operates whitewater rafting trips on several nearby rivers and teaches people to paddle in its canoe and kayak paddling school. The NOC also offers mountain bike rentals, group programs, outdoor retail, restaurants, ropes courses, kayak touring, fly fishing and hiking. It is an outdoor-enthusiast’s haven. 
We had reserved a private room in the bunkhouse. Our first stop was the General Store where we registered for our stay. It was around 2PM and check-in was not until 3 o’clock. Nonetheless, the gentleman behind the counter handed us our key cards and two towels. We promised we would wait until 3 to head up to the bunkhouse. We then went to the NOC outfitter and retrieved our bounce box with meds and supplies. No charge, no hassle. A coin laundry was attached to the General Store so we started a load. Hmm, what to do while we wait??? Eat! A stone’s throw from the General Store and Outfitter sat the Riverside Restaurant, where we grabbed a second lunch (Greek Salad and Chicken Chili), took what we needed from our re-supply box, and did a little planning for the days ahead.
When our laundry was done, we resealed our bounce box and had it shipped (bounced it) to Gatlinburg. We then gathered our packs and headed to the bunkhouse.  The A.T. passes directly through the heart of the NOC, crossing the Nantahala River on a bridge next to the outfitter. Another 1/4 mile up a hill sits a cluster of small cabins and bunkhouses. 
Just as we were getting settled, I got a phone call from K2. He and Hiker Doo had just completed their 13+ mile day hike, finishing at the NOC. So, WW and I scuttled back down the hill and across the footbridge, returning to the Riverside Restaurant for dinner. We had the same waitress, who had this look like, “Hey, weren’t you just in here?” We had the pizza this time. While we were eating, a section hiker who we had bumped into on the trail a couple of times came over to our table and asked for our Trail Journal URL. We also provided the URL to a retired Methodist Minister, who had the look in his eye of someone longing for the AT.
Today was a good day. Not only did we achieve another milestone, but WW felt great on the biggest descent to date. Tomorrow we climb out of the NOC, as a law of nature on the AT, what comes down, must go up!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584211,"What goes down, must come up, and up, and up, and up! We departed the NOC at 9:30 and immediately started the 3,200’ climb out of the NOC. The temps were a cool 25 degrees and flurries were flittering about in the wind.  The temperature did not rise above freezing the entire day. We hiked about a mile until we found the first piece of flat ground. With our muscles now warm from the climb, we commenced our morning stretching routine. While we were stopped, a total of four hikers passed us by. After the short break, the climb intensified and we soon went by two of the hikers. The tandem consisted of a thru hiker, Atlas, and his son-n-law, Matt, who just jumped on the trail at the NOC to join his father-n-law for a few days. As the young man was catching his breath, Which Way breezed by saying, “This stuff will build character.” Atlas replied, “Every day is a leg day.” So true!

About halfway into the six mile climb we came across a memorial to Wade Sutton, a firefighter who lost his life in 1960 while battling a blaze near this spot. We paused to pay tribute, placing a small stone on the memorial.
During yesterday’s descent into the NOC the decline was occasionally broken up with short periods of incline or flat ground. There were very few of those breaks today. The incline out of the NOC was only moderated by degrees of steepness—primarily steep, steeper, and steepest. About four miles in we hit a section that traversed its way up the side of a rock strewn hill, making the going slow. The temperature had also dropped and the wind was being funneled up from well below. Although we had long ago shed our jackets, our hands remained frozen under our gloves.
Shortly after zigzagging our way through the rock field, the trail skipped over to the south side of the mountain—the “Jump Up Point.” The winds were calm here and the sun shined brightly. We found a cozy spot against the rock cropping and sat with our packs against our backs, facing south, letting the sun warm our core. We enjoyed a PBJ wrap and shared a bag of Doritos WW picked up yesterday at the General Store. The spot below offered a view of the NOC, which appeared further down than it did across. I took a few pictures, but can’t seem to find them on my phone. 
As we were about to depart, the two hikers we had seen earlier showed up. We exchanged names and the thru hiker, Atlas, said he had been following our Trail Journal. Atlas started the AT about 10 days ago and was making really good time. He had previously hiked most of the northern third of the trail and climbed Katahdin seven times. As we got up to leave I noticed my sit pad and hiking pants were wet. Evidently I was leaning against the bite valve of my hydration system and most of the water in the reservoir ended up on the ground. 
Warm and fueled from our break we were ready to tackle the final mile of the climb. After initially heading the wrong direction, WW quickly course corrected and started up the steepest part of the climb. Sense of direction may not be one of her strong points, but hiking up mountains certainly is. She dominated the climb like the beast she is, increasing the gap between the two of us with each passing moment. The trail continued up the steep spur, never giving us a glimpse of the top. We rose over 800’ in the last mile and then...what, this is it? No view! Not even a marker! Does this mountain even have a name? It was about as anticlimactic as it gets...and then we started down. A friend who hiked the AT in 2016 (trial name FOB) texted that the climb out of the NOC was the fourth most difficult on the trail. We will take that, as we finished it no worse for the wear.  
Less than a mile up the trail we arrived at the Sassafrass Gap Shelter. At around 2PM, we were the first to arrive at the large shelter. It was very cold and there were no good places to tent. We were tempted to move on, but decided to stick with our low mileage strategy. We claimed two spots on the bottom deck of the shelter and fetched water from a nearby spring. Shortly, other hikers began showing up, including several faces from the past—Zoltan, Josh, Heartburn, Close Call, Spirit Man, Nadia and Yarro. New acquaintances included Life Alert, Tangerine, Liam, Espresso & Clover, and  McCayla and her dog Slater. Others would show up after we were snuggled in our bags. Everyone agreed on one thing—IT’S COLD UP HERE!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584230,"We survived another cold night in the shelter. We hoped that our collective body heat would warm it up a bit, but I didn’t notice any difference from when I first crawled in my sleeping bag around 6:30 pm and when we got up around 7 am. Cold is cold!! My sweet Next Step got up before the sun rose to make us a hot breakfast, as he does every day we’re out on the trail!! (And let me just pause a moment here to brag on my amazing husband!!! Go ahead, those who want to can roll your eyes, but he deserves a shout out!!! On the first day of our hike I found little love notes all throughout my pack. Things like, “The woods are just better with you in them.” And I know he really feels that way! He has been having an awesome time but has had to spend a lot of time worrying about me. When I told him that I felt a bit selfish for wanting to tough it out he reassured me that it was worth it for me to stay on this adventure with him. So Next Step, you’re my hero and I feel beyond blessed to share this journey with you!!)

 Okay, for those who don’t like the mushy stuff, you can start reading again!! Lol 
 So we were the second ones out of the shelter. Our entry yesterday mentioned that the summit was a bit anti-climactic. Well, the reason was, we hadn’t reached the summit!!! Even after all the up, up, up yesterday, we still had about a .7 mile climb to reach the top of Cheoah Gap and it was worth the climb. At the top we had amazing views, and the perfect spot for our morning yoga!! Peanut Butter and Jelly walked up just as we were leaving and agreed that it was the perfect spot for a break. We leap frogged with Tangerine for most of the morning. Then as we passed a campsite on down the trail, we saw Atlas and his son-in-law Matt getting ready to hit the trail. At one point I had gone on ahead of Next Step, and Atlas and Matt had caught up with him and they were able to chat a bit before we started our descent into Steccoah Gap. I “smelled the barn” and put it into high gear. I am so relieved that I am now on day 3 of pain free hiking. I’m sure there will be aches and pains on down the trail, but for now I’m just enjoying the beautiful days God has given us to be in His creation!
We had made a reservation at a motel in Robbinsville which was about 7 miles from Steccoah Gap. 
 The lady that owned the motel had told us to just start walking toward town and someone would give us a ride. I’m not sure if you’ve seen the 2 lane roads in the mountains of NC, but that didn’t seem like a great idea, so we just decided to cross the road and stand there and hope that someone would pick us up. Several cars zoomed by as I gave a friendly wave. Next Step was on his phone searching for shuttle options. Finally a nice lady in a white pickup braked and we thought she was going to stop, but her vehicle disappeared around the curve. A few minutes later, she reappeared, after finding a spot to turn around. She rolled down her window and I thought I heard her say, “I hope you all can fit your stuff back here with all the garbage. I’m on my way to the dump.” But what she actually said was, “I hope YOU ALL can fit back there with all your stuff and the garbage”!!! REALLY!?!?! I know I’ve been in the woods for a few days, but seriously?? But beggars can’t be choosers so Next Step and I climbed in and literally sat on top of each other, hoping that we were wedged in so tightly that we wouldn’t fly out if we hit a big bump. He tried to make me feel better and reminded me that we used to ride like this all the time when we were kids!! Soon we made it to the dump where Next Step helped her unload all the garbage and then she asked where we wanted to be dropped off. We told her the motel and she had a look of disgust on her face. “What?” I asked. “Is it a real dump?” “No,” she replied, ”my ex in-laws just own that motel.” Whew!!! So she still took us and dropped us. We were needing to get showers and get our laundry done, because Next Step’s sister, Kari, and her husband, Jeff, and daughter, Claire (and friend, Abbey) were in Gatlinburg for Spring Break this week and had wanted to make the nearly 3 hour drive over to Robbinsville to meet us for dinner.  But hiker hunger took over and we headed straight for the Mexican Restaurant for a quick lunch before we started our chores. As we were eating, the lady sitting at the booth behind us, walked up and said that she had been listening to our conversation and wondered if she could ask some questions about thru-hiking. Of course!!! Pull up a chair!!! So we talked to Pat and her husband for at least 20 minutes as we finished our lunch. 
 As we got back to the room Kari texted that they had done about all there was to do in Robbinsville, so they could go ahead and meet us. They picked up Next Step and drove him to the laundromat while I showered and then Jeff came back and picked me up to join them. The laundromat just happened to be attached to an ice cream shop and Jeff, being a true Trail Angel, treated us to ice cream. Um, yes, I’ll have two scoops please! They graciously sat with us the hour and a half it took to get our one load of laundry done, then took us back to the motel so we could change out of our rain gear (the only clean “clothes” we had to wear while we were doing laundry. The lady that had driven us to town had recommended a little locally owned restaurant for supper and it did not disappoint!
 Once again, Jeff and Kari provided some trail magic and treated us to supper. The time with family was just what we needed! I noticed that Darrell and I were talking a mile a minute and we do the same thing when we get to talk to our kids and other family when we get to towns. We have always been able to talk to any of them any time, and now we cherish every conversation and every time we can be together!!! Thanks guys for making the drive to see us. It will carry us through!!! 
 Now it’s time for some R&R as Next Step and I talk about our options for our next Zero, whether it will be here or at Fontana Village. But I can promise you that I’ll sleep well tonight in a warm cozy bed!!!
 I’m so learning to appreciate the little things!!! –Hugs, Which Way

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584241,"Not much happening here in the little mountain town of Robinsville. According to my count, there are two traffic lights. No movie theater, no bowling alley, no fun! There is only so much you can do to stretch out re-supply shopping, mailing packages, and cleaning gear. 

The highlight of our day was finding a great little place to eat on the outskirts of town (a whopping 5 minute walk). The Hub is an old gas station converted to a cafe/restaurant, featuring delicious burgers and bbq. Out back is a partially covered outdoor area with corn hole, foosball, and other games. Evidently the show ""Moonshiners"" films there, they have live bands and are packed in the warm season. While we waited for our yummy “Dragon Slayer” burger, Which Way whooped me in a game of corn hole (21-0). She ended the game by tossing all four bags in the hole in one turn. This AT hiking has put her confidence through the roof. 

Back at the room, we re-cleaned and re-packed our gear. Watching reruns of “The Office” now and
Are waiting for hiker midnight. Ready to hit the trail in the morning.

",Robinsville - Pan Ran Motel,"Mar 16, Fri",0
Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584371,"By 0800 we were at the McDonalds across the street from our motel eating Egg McMuffins. We decided to go ahead and check out and take our packs to breakfast with us in hopes of catching a ride back to Stecoah Gap. Other than a half dozen hometown boys huddled in their morning coffee group, the place was void of activity. One of the fellows was looking our way and I sensed an offer was near.  As we were downing our last bites, he made his move. Roger, an older man wielding a walking stick, stood up and made his way to our table. “Good morning, are you all Appalachian Trail hikers?” Unsuccessfully tampering our excitement at where we knew the conversation was headed, we answered in unison, “Yes sir, we are!”  Over to Roger, “Do you need a ride back up the mountain?” Back to us, “YES SIR!” Before Roger started back to his seat, he said, “Just let me know when you are ready.”  I offered to buy him a cup of coffee, but he declined. A few minutes later the three of us were piled in the cab of his truck, our gear nice and dry in the covered bed.
During the 10 minute drive into the mountains, Roger said he gives hikers a lift whenever he can. He told his friends that they should do the same, adding that “those hikers are harmless.” (Their odor notwithstanding). Roger is absolutely correct. Long distance hikers are stripped down to the bare necessities, uninterested in carrying anything more than they need to get them from Point A to Point B. When a hiker pops out of the woods, their only concern is likely a hot shower and something to eat (not necessarily in that order). Once a hiker is clean, full, re-supplied and rested, the woods are calling again and they are in need of nothing other than a way back to the trailhead.
Roger returned us safely to Stecoah Gap, refusing my offer to give him money for gas. As he pulled away the rain began to fall, so we pulled out our pack covers before hitting the trail. Since the air was warm we decided to just hike in the rain wearing only shorts, a T-shirt, and a cap. Sun was in the forecast in the afternoon, so we figured the less that got wet, the faster we would dry. We were loaded down with four to five days of food and supplies and a couple of liters of water each. Which Way’s Dad had shipped us a re-supply box to the Fontana Village Post Office, located on the edge of the Smokies. But, when I realized that we would be arriving in Fontana Village on the weekend, I called the post office and requested that they re-direct the package to Robinsville. Thus, the reason for a zero day in Robinsville and fully loaded packs coming out. 
About a mile into the hike we hit a steep incline known as “Jacob’s Ladder.” The steady rain and heavy packs made the .6 mile, 600 foot ascent a bit challenging. Nonetheless, it was not as difficult as I had pictured after reading dozens of accounts from other hikers over the years. As we neared the top, we stopped to let Which Way catch a breather and to grab a quick snack. It was then that the only two hikers that we would see on the trail today passed us by. Just as we crested Jacobs Ladder, the rain stopped and the sun began to peer through the fog. How cool!

Fun fact: From Springer Mountain to this point in our hike, our total ascent is over 39,000 feet. To put that in perspective, Mount Everest stands 29,019 feet above sea level. Oh, and we have descended the same amount. The next time you are cruising in a jet at 35,000 feet, look down and imagine walking from where you sit to the ground and back.

We hiked a couple of more miles before stopping for lunch, perching atop Brushnel Knob, offering views on both sides of the narrow ridge top. The skies had cleared by now and the bright sun and soft breeze quickly dried our rain-soaked clothes.
 Minus some muddy spots and a few clusters of slippery moss covered rocks that we were forced to hike over and/or through, the terrain for the remainder of the hike was ideal. We were the first hikers to arrive at Cable Gap Shelter, a small structure resembling a log cabin with the front end open. The tent was up quickly and we were down for a nap by 3PM. Several other thru hikers soon trickled in, along with a group of teenage boys and their chaperones. They are a church group on spring break, hiking southbound from Fontana Dam to the NOC. From their interaction with each other and brief conversations with us, it became apparent that they were a very nice group of young men. As they were preparing to cook their dinner, one of the men provided us a bit of comic relief. With his stove and fuel canister in hand, he gathered a few of the boys around and said, “This is how Grizzly Adams and Daniel Boone showed me how to do it.” Evidently the valve in his MSR Pocket Rocket stove was turned wide open, so when he screwed the stove to the canister, it immediately began spewing propane. “Hey, it spewed liquid all over me!” Then he set the fire to it and, of course, it shot a flame in his face. One of his students then yelled, “Turn it down, turn it down!” Then, the other man came over and showed him how to work the control valve. Down to one eyebrow, but with the flame under control, he set his pot on top of the three-pronged stove and watched it teeter. “Hey, this sure doesn’t seem very stable!” The star student then said, “Sir, you need to pull the prongs apart.” Thankfully he did not grab the now hot prongs with his bare hands. I reckon Grizzly Adams and Daniel Boone left a few minor details out when showing him how it was done.
 As I am finishing this journal entry, it is dark, we are back in our tent, a storm is brewing in the distance, and two owls are exchanging cackles and screeches (some type of mating call I think).

", Cable Gap Shelter,"Mar 17, Sat",8.50
Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584401,"When we crawled inside our tent last night, the wind was blowing hard and the sky was lit up with lightning. But, following a great night’s sleep in the cool mountain air, we were pleasantly surprised to find that our tent was completely dry this morning. What? No rain! The day just got better from there.

We set out from the shelter a little after 0800, with just the right amount of chill in the air. Already in shorts, our fleece tops came off after the first climb. It was also a good spot to pause for our Sunday morning communion and worship. By this time, the sun had burned through most of the fog, and we were able to see Fontana Lake and the dam in the valley below. The lake view came in and out of the picture as we drew closer to our goal—the Fontana Hilton (don’t get too excited- it’s actually a shelter). 
The hike itself was uneventful for the most part. A descent of 2,000 feet, over three miles, brought us to an elevation of 1,800’.  At this low elevation, we began to see signs of Spring.  The Dogwoods and Redbuds were coming into bloom along the lake and Trillium with yellow and maroon blooms lined the trail as we neared the shelter. 
Oh, and the Fontana Shelter! It well earned its nickname, “The Fontana Hilton.” Sitting on a point overlooking the teal colored Fontana Lake, the shelter is plush by A.T. standards. It sits on a well- groomed landscape, sleeps 20, has running water, and a bathhouse, where we took a quick shower.  Over to Which Way to complete the post. 
- Next Step

So, as Next Step said, the Fontana Shelter had a bathhouse, but were missing one key ingredient...a bath towel. No worries. My dirty fleece jacket would work just fine. We were going to do laundry when we got into Fontana Village anyway. Lol

We called for the shuttle and were told that we’d have to wait half an hour for the shuttle driver to finish his lunch break before he could come get us. Sure, take your time, I’ll just be over here eating my left arm! I was feeling a bit hangry at that moment, but managed a smile when he finally pulled up. Our shuttle driver took us straight to the Pit Stop for sausage dogs with chili, cheese and jalapeños. I have NEVER eaten a whole sausage dog in my life, until today. I’ve also never hiked for three weeks and over 160 miles straight either?!?  Oh and of course some bbq chips, a Coke Zero and ice cream treat to go with that sausage dog. We resupplied the remaining items we need to get us thru the first half of The Smokies. Then we walked a bit up the hill to the laundromat. Next Step and I got the laundry done and best of all, we were able to talk to both the kiddos and my parents while we waited for the laundry to finish. Then we walked WAAAYYY up the hill to the Mountainview Bistro for supper. Don’t worry, we just had a nice salad, a cup of black bean and brisket soup and shared a blackened chicken flatbread sandwich. Fortunately the shuttle will come back to pick us up to take us back to the shelter. (Unless they’re taking their supper break!! Just kidding!!! I know I’m not the only one that needs to eat!!!)
As we mentioned, we’ll be heading into the Smokies tomorrow and will get picked up by our AMAZING Trail Angels, Susie and Al on Thursday. They’re calling for snow on Tuesday and Wednesday. We’ll be crossing the highest elevation on the AT on Thursday, so we would appreciate lots of prayers for the snow to either go somewhere else or at least to keep us safe if it does hit us. (But I prefer the former!!) Not sure what kind of cell service we’ll have over the next few days, so don’t worry if we aren’t able to post on the journal every day. However, if you don’t hear from us by supper time on Thursday evening, you might want to send the snow patrol!! I hope to be sending a message from the Mellow Mushroom in Gatlinburg by then:-)
Hugs! - Which Way Update: We lingered too long at the Bistro and decided to get a room at the lodge. (Oh darn – NOT!!!) Two showers in one day!!!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584502,"There were two options for breakfast. The restaurant in the lodge opened at 0800 and offered a continental style breakfast. Wanting to hit the trail early and always looking to eat our way to a lighter pack, we opted instead to cook up breakfast on the patio of our room. It was the usual grits for Which Way and oatmeal for me. But, we would add a side of pop tarts to our meal. 

It was a little after 0800 before we made it to the front desk to check out. The shuttle van was in for service today, so the receptionist called one of the maintenance guys to pick us up.  
We finally hit the trail about 0845, walking down a road for about a mile before coming to Fontana Dam. The trail crosses over the top of the dam, entering the Great Smoky Mountains on the far side. Fontana Dam was built in the early 1940s in order to generate power for nearby mining operations that supplied metals in support of the war effort. We stopped about half way across the massive structure to shoot a short video. The path continued to follow the park road for another mile before coming to the trailhead. It offered a good place to stop and stretch our muscles for the hike ahead of us. 

A metal box was posted a few yards into the woods for depositing park passes. A pass is required for all hikers entering the Smokies. We had purchased our passes for $20 in Franklin and printed them in the lodge last night. Two other hikers, Spam Town Rick and Hops were depositing their passes as well. Rick is a retired production manager at a meat processing plant in Austin, Minnesota (a.k.a. Spam Town). Hops, a retired Senior Director at the National Aquarium, resides in the Chesapeake, MD area. We would play leapfrog the rest of the day with Rick, Hops and another hiker, RC from Owensboro, KY.  
 After we crossed the dam, it was a steady climb up to Shuckstack, Mtn (elevation 3,995’).  A short distance later we paused at a stream to filter enough water to get us to Mollie’s Ridge Shelter, our destination for the night. The trail surface under our feet had been good all day and it now rolled up and down, progressing toward 4,500 feet. 
 Just as we paused for lunch a cold rain began falling, making for some soggy P&J wraps. Undeterred, we inhaled the calories and continued hiking. The rain continued to fall for about an hour, but stopped in time for us to dry out before reaching the shelter. 
Rick, Hops, RC, and two other hikers we remembered from the Siler Bald “Breakfast Club” were at the shelter when we arrived. The other two hikers continued on to the next shelter, about 3.2 miles up the trail. Following suit were a man and his two teenaged sons and the Crawford family—a family of eight from Cincinnati (see pic in photo section of journal). The ages of the four girls and two boys ranged from 2 to 15ish. The children, all carrying their own packs, beat their parents to the shelter by 5 minutes. The father was toting the toddler on his back. They put us to shame, as they too continued to the next shelter.
Everybody is getting a little antsy about a Winter Storm that might move in tomorrow night. Which Way and I also contemplated hiking on while the weather is still good, but opted to stay put. The 12 mile day was already a 50 percent increase over the daily miles we have been logging lately. Not to mention that our ascent of over 4,000’ was a first. Finally, our packs are loaded down with four day’s worth of provisions.  We will still have the option to press a little further tomorrow if conditions permit. Either way, we will not be able to make it up and over Clingman’s Dome before the storm moves in Tuesday night, as forecasted.
We were all tucked in our bags inside the shelter before dark. Soon thereafter the wind picked up, blowing hard against the tarp covering the opening in the shelter, and a very thick fog rolled in. When WW and I got up to use the bathroom at 9:30PM, two other hikers from the Siler Bald “Breakfast Club” were just strolling in. They said they could barely find their way in the fog. I hear thunder now! It could be a long night, but we are warm, dry, and safe.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584570,"The winds calmed last night at the command of an extremely loud burst of thunder. Then came the rain to calm the thunder and eventually the rain would submit to clearing skies. The stars still shined brightly when I stumbled down the trail a bit in search of an ever elusive cell signal. No joy! When I returned to camp to retrieve our food bags from the bear cable system the stars were fading with the rise of dawn.

Minus the duo from the Siler Bald Breakfast Club, everyone was up and out early in hopes of beating the rain. Which Way and I also hoped to push a few miles past our planned 12 mikes in an effort to get a little closer to Newfound Gap (and access to Gatlinburg) ahead of the approaching storm. 
All was well during the first 3 miles of our hike, with cool temps, calm skies, and soft terrain. We planned to filter water at the next shelter (3 miles into the hike), but realizing we may have passed it by, I pulled up the Guthook app on my phone to learn that the side trail to the shelter was .1 miles behind us and then it was another .2 miles to the shelter. Rather than turn back, we decided to suck it up until the next water source about 2.5 miles up the trail. 
The climb up Thunderhead Mountain was steep, yet quite scenic at first, with grassy fields and orchards lining the path. We paused about two-thirds of the way up, for a view of Rocky Top Mountain (as in “good ol’ Rocky Top, Rocky Top Tennessee...”). Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that yesterday we hit the NC/TN border and that the trail kind of skirts the border through most of the Smokey Mtns. The shelter we stayed in last night was on the Tennessee side of the border, as will be the next several shelters.

The last third of the climb up Thunderhead Mountain was over steep, wet, and rocky terrain. Some rocks were large enough to cause us to take paus and carefully choose a line up and over. Other parts consisted of small loose rocks down in a rut. Needless to say, it was slow going. Making it a bigger challenge was the fact that we were out of water. No worries, my sister, Kari, had given us each a honey sucker back in Robinsville that we were saving for such a moment.  The honey-sweet sucker quenched our thirst and provided the boost of energy we needed to summit Thunderhead. Now we had been seeing signs of bear all day (e.g. scat, fur, clawed trees) and could even smell a pungent odor likely from their urine (it was either that or the Breakfast Club was hiking just ahead of us). Wait! Bear signs plus remnants of honey sucker on our lips and sticky fingers, thanks Kari. 

More rock obstacles greeted us on the descent from Thunderhead.  We encountered several south bound section hikers along the way, including one young man resembling a forest elf and a group of overdressed college students. 

We finally arrived at a sign pointing the way to our water source. Unfortunately, it was about 200 yards down a steep hill. To make matters worse, the handle on my Katadyne Filter broke off during the process. The filter has been clogged for a couple of weeks, making it harder to push the pump handle. Despite cleaning the filter, it quickly gets stopped up with sediment in the field. We will be using water treatment tablets until we can get to town to purchase a new filter system. 

Still two miles out from Derrick Knob Shelter, the rain began to fall. Wearing shorts and t-shirts, we walked up to the shelter sopping wet and cold. We quickly ducked behind the shelter tarp to put on dry clothes. Rick and Hops were already there, along with the core group of the Breakfast Club. We made some lunch while contemplating our next move. Meanwhile, a couple we passed on the way up Derrick’s Knob, came into the shelter for a quick respite, then moved on. Hops told us that we just missed the patriarch from the Crawford Family giving the other seven a “pep talk” as they were ready to make the 5 mile dash to the next shelter (which only holds 12 hikers). Our decision was made. Although it was only three o’clock, we did not want to risk hiking in the cold, wet rain, only to arrive at a full shelter with limited daylight remaining. 

There is a stone fireplace inside the shelter, so I worked with Frizzle and Nugs (original Breakfast Club members) in gathering wood and providing some warmth inside the tarp. Together, we sent a different kind of smoke up the chimney. Of course, Which Way, in her kindred motherly spirit, easily entered into conversation with the group. Building bridges. 

Dinner shortly followed lunch. Other hikers stroked in, including RC, Little Furry Animal (from an old Pink Floyd song), who hiked all the way from Fontana Dam, and at least one hiker who slipped in after dark. We found a spot to lay our sleep mats and bags on the top shelves of the shelter. We laid awake a bit longer, listening to the rain hit the roof. Then the noise stopped. Snow!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584645,"Did someone say this was the first day of Spring? On the AT in the Smokies, it is anything but Spring like! It started snowing before hiker midnight and continued through the night and all day. My best estimate is 6-10 inches depending on the elevation.  When we got started at 9:15 this morning, only RC was still left at Derrick’s Knob Shelter. Little Furry Animal and the entire Siler Bald Breakfast Club were planning to hike 18 miles to Newfound Gap (and access to Gatlinburg). Rick, Hops, and RC had a more modest goal of hiking 5.7 miles to Siler Bald Shelter and then assessing the situation. There was another section hiker that set out before us.
When we started the hike, about 5” of snow had already fallen and it was still coming down at a steady rate. With the exception of some drifting snow on parts of the trail, we could easily follow in the tracks of the hikers that set out before us. About 1/4 mile into the hike, the young section hiker approached us, headed back in the direction of the shelter. When I asked if everything was okay, he replied, “I’m just on Spring Break, it was supposed to be warm.” 
In the Smoky Mountains, there are fewer than usual white blazes painted on trees/rocks to mark the trail. At one point today we travelled for over a half mile without seeing a blaze and there was nothing but the footsteps we were following to indicate that we were even on a trail. An occasional fallen tree that had been sawed off to clear the path or a stumble over an erosion control log would let me know we were on a trail, but was it the AT? Periodically, I would open my Guthook App, toggle the GPS position locater on, and give thanks when the blue bubble was on the trail overlay.  

Even though the weather presented a potentially dangerous situation, the drifting snow and icy white painted trees and shrubs were a wondrous sight to see. At one point in the wintery hike we jumped a grouse that was hunkered down under a half-hollowed fallen tree. The beautiful bird lifted off producing its signature “whop-whop-whop” sound as the air was pushed under the flap of its sturdy wings. As it flew low across our path a mere 10 yards in front of me, we were reminded that we were not weathering the storm alone. Regardless of the season or conditions it truly is a wonderland out here.

With the windblown snow drifting up to two feet and covering the trail, the footprints left by the hikers ahead of us were quickly fading. We pressed on with me out front clearing a path and Which Way rocking steadily behind me through the deep snow and harsh wind. It was around 1PM when we finally arrived at Siler Bald Shelter.  Rick, Pops, and the Breakfast Club were all there, and clearly staying put for the rest of the day. So much for hiking 18 miles to Newfound Gap. Which Way and I quickly decided we were hiking another two miles over Siler Bald to the next shelter. RC came in shortly after us and said he would press on too. We stayed warm enough while we were hiking, but quickly got chilled when we stopped to break for lunch. We managed to choke down a frozen tuna and pepper jack cheese wrap and some chips, washed down with slushy water. Then came the hardest part, as we changed out of our warm down jackets, back into our cold damp hiking clothes. We did some jumping jacks and push-ups to get the blood flowing to the fingers and toes, donned our packs, and stepped out into the worst conditions of the day. The 30mph wind blew the snow hard against our tiring bodies and the snow drifts were now three feet high in places. There were no more footprints to guide us and at times we were trudging through knee deep snow. At one point my fingers and toes went numb. Then something strange happened. We hit a point where I could see nothing but drifts of snow ahead, No ruts, or sawed off trees, or white blazes, or any other indicators that we were on the right path. It was at that instant, when I had a twinge of self-doubt that we were even on a trail. In an instant, a rush of adrenaline washed over my body, immediately warming my extremities. 
A minute later I picked up a sign that we were on the right path and all self-doubt turned to a sense of euphoria. At one point I turned back to Which Way and bellowed, “This is awesome, what an adventure!” I’m not so certain that WW shared my sense of adulation, but she showed a lot of intestinal fortitude today and every other day of this journey. As we drew nearer the Double Spring Gap Shelter, we both agreed we were happy with the decisions we had made over the last few days. We also talked about the work that had to get done as soon as we arrived at the shelter, thinking we would be the only ones there and knowing the inevitable chill that would set in soon after we stopped hiking. Not long after the stone structure came into view it became apparent that we would not be alone.  I counted three people under the side awning preparing food and could see smoke billowing from the chimney. As we circled around to the front, I noticed the section hiker Tom from a few days back and his two sons, one wielding a small saw to cut through fallen trees. When I pulled the tarp back on the 12-person shelter, there were at least that many inside and the absolutely jovial bunch greeted us with open arms. I timidly inquired, “Um, is there room in the shelter?” The reply came without hesitation, “We will make room!” I informed the group that one more hiker would arrive soon. “We will make room for him too.”

 In addition to Tom and his boys, were a group of five girls from Calvary College, MI (on a Spring Break outing), a former Army Ranger, Break Time, and his friend who were section hiking, two thru hiking sisters—Popcorn and Pancake—who we had not yet met, and even some familiar faces, namely Close Call and Heartburn. It turns out that US 441 was closed at Newfound Gap due to “Winter Storm Toby” and the entire group had all had been here since yesterday. There was enough firewood stacked inside to keep hikers warm the rest of the year. But, the true warmth exuded from the souls inside the shelter. Everyone worked together to accommodate each other in a very tight living space. I ended up with a spot on the top shelf with WW below me on the bottom. RC would arrive later and set up his one-man tent on the floor. 
They all wanted to know what it was like hiking through all of that snow. I convinced them that it was difficult, but not impossible with appropriate clothing and the right “gear between the ears.” They were soon persuaded that it was better to set out early tomorrow when the temperatures were still cold, and the snow still powdery and light.  So, tomorrow we will set out together, taking turns up front plowing through the drifts. I could not think of a better group to hike with. With the temps forecast to rise into the 40s by the afternoon, we are hopeful that the roads will reopen to Newfound Gap, a mere 10.5 trail miles away. Oh, did I mention we would also be crossing over the highest peak on the AT--Clingman’s Dome.

The chatter continued until Hiker’s midnight. No one was complaining.  As I told WW good night, she said she would miss my warm back. Music to my ears that rang in my head for several minutes. As everyone else was fading quickly, I slipped out of my quilt and into my frozen shoes. Then I slipped outside and let my food bag down from the bear cable. I opened the bag up to retrieve my pot and stove, then reattached the food bag and hoisted it back up. Once inside, I heated a liter of water to fill two 500ml Nalgene bottles. I then roused WW, handing her the hot bottle to place in the bottom of her sleeping bag. “Maybe this will help keep you warm, Sweetie.” The soft reply came next, “You are my hero.” More music to my ears!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584720,"WOWSA!!!! So as most of you know, we were hit with Winter Storm Toby. I am hoping that neither of my kids decides to name any of our grandchildren Toby, because it will be awhile before I can look on that name with anything but disdain! It is a scary feeling when you are in a shelter and have just spent the last day hiking thru a snow storm and you know the only way off the mountain is to keep hiking thru the snow! The group of 17 collectively decided that we were all hiking the 10.5 miles off the mountain today. Next Step had indicated that we REALLY needed to get going by 8AM in order to make sure we were out by dark. It was taking us about an hour per mile yesterday with all the drifts and we knew today would be even worse with the higher elevations. Also, one good thing about yesterday was that, for the most part, we were able to follow a previous hiker’s tracks, but today, whoever left first would be paving the way for the rest of the group. And who do you think that would be??? Next Step!!! He was truly a beast!!! 
The first half mile was not bad and we were thinking that we would make really good time but then we hit the uphill climb to Clingman’s Dome (elevation 6,658 feet), which is the highest point on the AT. We were literally plowing through thigh high drifts (which for me were up to my waist) for a good part of the day. I was following in Next Step’s footprints just to be able to keep up. It was completely exhausting and I can’t even imagine how it would have been if he had not been in front of me! The group of college girls caught up to us just before we summited Clingman’s Dome. They were full of joy and just a blessing to be around. They were announcing each “branch”, “step”, “slippery spot”, to the person behind them so as to keep it as safe as possible. They were singing and just keeping all of us motivated. Soon after our summit we parted ways. Tom and his two boys caught up with us at that point and the older son wanted to blaze the trail for a bit. GLADLY!!! It was mostly downhill at that point. It was more like going down a ski slope with hiking shoes on! Of course with the snow, it was impossible to see the wooden steps, rocks, etc. until you slid down them. We had several falls, but thankfully we had the soft snow to catch us. Today, the down hills were definitely MUCH easier than the uphills! We never saw the rest of our group of “17”, but we had to meet up later with one of the sister thru hikers, Popcorn. Next Step had handed me “my” hiking poles this morning (in the dark). You think I might have questioned him when I picked them up and realized that one of the poles was about 2 inches shorter than the other. Had did that happen?!? About 2 miles down the trail, I realized that one pole (my pole) had a cork handle and the other one did not. Hmmm?!?! And they both were showing an “L” indicating I had two left poles!!!!! Ok, Which Way, Which Pole, Two Left Poles, so many trail names to choose from at this point!! Next Step sent a text back to the group that had not yet left the shelter, to let them know I had someone’s pole. Heartburn texted back that it was Popcorn’s and that she had our phone number and we would make the exchange later. Whew!! 
Finally around 2:30 Next Step made a phone call to our trail angels, Susie and Al, to see if they had gotten the road open where they were planning to pick us up. They were on their way and were going to stop at the Visitor’s Center to make sure they could get to Newfound Gap. We lost the signal and just kept hiking, praying that the road would be open. When we finally were able to get them back on the phone and I heard Al say that they were there, I literally started crying! I had been using all of my mental and physical energy to get myself through the snow and off the mountain, and just to know that we were about 15 minutes from safety, was just such a relief, I couldn’t help myself. Next Step told him that we were beyond hungry. We had just eaten power bars for breakfast so that we could get right out this morning and then our tuna had actually frozen so we just ate a Cliff Bar, some trail mix and a couple of small Snicker bars on the whole ten mile hike. We already knew that there was a Mellow Mushroom in Gatlinburg, so we asked if we could go straight there, even before our showers!! Desperate times call for desperate measures!! When we saw them in the parking lot, I took off in a sprint to hug Susie and Al! Just as we were getting ready to head out, we saw Spirit Man and asked if he needed a ride into Gatlinburg. “You betcha!,” came the reply. And would he like to go to Mellow Mushroom with us? “YOU BETCHA!!!” We all crammed into the backseat and were sitting in the restaurant within minutes. When I stopped by the restroom before getting to our seats, I almost cried again just to have hot running water and all the hand soap I wanted!!! I love how the trail is changing how I see things. I just hope I keep this level of gratefulness after the hike.
We are now in the motel and are watching basketball (GO BIG BLUE) and getting ready to have our cookies and milk, and Susie and I are listening to Al and Next Step banter back and forth. I’ve talked to my kiddos and my parents. I’m just so thankful for so many things right now, and even for what we just made it through the last few days. You just really don’t realize what you can do, until you HAVE to do it! God is good and all is right with my world.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584810,"After a brutal couple of days on the trail, it was nice to let the muscles recover a bit. Of course, a hiker’s work is never done (but a hike’rs work is always fun). After breakfast (first things first), we spent most of the morning at the grocery, post office, and NOC Outfitters, where I picked up a new headlamp and filter system. I’m not sure what happened to my Black Diamond Spot headlamp. Although it was operating fine the last night on the trail, the light seemed to be dimming, so I decided to change out the batteries. After putting the new batteries in, I turned it on and...nothing! Of course, I switched batteries in and out for about 30 minutes, matching the +/- on the battery with the +/- in the battery compartment of the lamp. Finally, I switched out batteries from WWs functional headlamp. Still no joy, so I called REI to find out when I purchased the headlamp and inquired on how I should proceed. REI has a one year return policy for members, no questions asked, and the store rep on the other end of the line was quickly able to tell me that it was purchased online in mid-October of 2017. Since I don’t have time to wait around while a new lamp arrives, I decided I would just send the defective product forward to Hot Springs, NC in our bounce box containing our meds and other re-supplies. We will be meeting with some of our family in Hot Springs, so I will send the lamp home with them and return it for a full refund after our journey is complete. In the meantime, I needed to buy a new one. 
While shopping at the NOC, we ran into Close Call, Spamtown Rick and Hops at the NOC Outfitter (the flagship store). By then it was time to eat again, so we swung by Five Guys Burgers and Fries, where we ran into Spirit Man again. The hikers are taking over Gatlinburg! Actually we barely put a dent in the activity on this little tourist destination in the mountains. There must be a convention here this weekend, because the streets and sidewalks were bustling with folks scarfing up what Gatlinburg had to offer. Around the corner from Five Guys was a small outdoor mall, where a Blue Grass Band was playing music. Sitting on one of the benches was a walking advertisement for The Hatfields and McCoys AYCE restaurant. He graciously agreed to let me get a pic with him, then handed me 20% off coupon for the AYCE buffet. I wanted to see if there would be a visible change in my appearance—namely my waistline—after spending a couple of days in Gatlinburg. I will get an after pic to post later. 
After taking care of hiker business, we went back to our efficiency apartment-style room at the Olde Gatlinburg and just hung out with Susie and Al, Trail Angels turned friends. Susie showed us a new card game (Golf), which I then showed her how to play, taking the first game. She must be a quick study because she took the victory in Round Two. Completely out of character, Which Way did not demand a third game, in hopes of making the leader board. Could the trail be transforming her?!?!

We decided to take a double ZERO in Gatlinburg. Rain is in the forecast on Saturday and we are hoping that some of the snow will melt off of the trail, which by now is treacherously icy. We have a day to kill anyway, since it looks like we will arrive in Hot Springs before our family arrives next week. Yes, they are driving, we are walking, but we will get there first—hmmm?! Susie and Al are headed back to Sky Valley, GA on Saturday and the Olde Gatlinburg is fully booked. Most of the other hotels/motels in the area are also booked, but Gigi at the front desk was able to help us find another place like this one, just up the street (and the price was right). Spirit Man, who is also taking a D-ZERO, will take the other room.

Finally, I wanted to share another update on the Crawford Family. Evidently the story I relayed a couple of days ago was not 100% accurate. I heard through the hiker grapevine that the toddler was in bad shape and arrangements had been made to evacuate the family from the mountains. However, I also heard through the grapevine yesterday that the family was seen at the NOC Outfitters, looking no worse for wear and gearing up to resume their hike. Anyway, thank you for lifting up prayers for the Crawfords and all of the other hikers who endured Winter Storm Toby.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584962,"The shuttle arrived at the Sidney James Hotel shortly after we downed our pancake breakfast with Spirit Man. Close Call and Heartburn had already been picked up and shuffled around to make room for Which Way, Spirit Man, and me. As the shuttle worked its way up the mountain, we were all anxious to see what the trail conditions would be after all of the snow and then rain. When we arrived at Newfound Gap (elev. 5,029’) we were delighted to see that there were only patches of snow remaining in the surrounding area. After unloading our gear we asked the shuttle driver, Robby, to snap a picture of the five us. Looking at the photo, Sprit Man is on the far left, Heartburn is on the far right, and Close Call is standing next to Which Way.
After taking another picture, this one of a sign indicating that it was a mere 1,972 miles to Katahdin, ME, we started our ascent to 6,000+ feet elevation. The trail near the parking area is traveled by tens of thousands of tourists and other hikers every year, making the path wide and worn. Other than the annoying timber step-ups, the climb was gentle and the path was perfect. But, as we ascended a couple of hundred feet higher, patches of ice began to appear on the path. Less than a half mile into our hike we were navigating an icy, slushy, snow covered trail. The only relief came when we were walking in ice cold water, as the trail had turned into a stream from the snow melt.  We passed several day hikers on our way up to side trails leading to Rainbow Falls and Charles Bunion. After passing Charles Bunion the trail once again became the rugged, single-track path we are accustomed to. Despite the poor trail conditions and the clouds obstructing views of surrounding mountains, the area immediately surrounding the area had a distinct beauty.  Stretches of the trail were dense with evergreen trees and boulders, both were covered with moss, in multiple shades of green. In other sections, the trail was cut into the sides of mountains.  WW commented that it felt as if we were hiking to a dragon’s lair. 
A little over three miles into the hike, we stopped at Ice Water Springs Shelter (a fitting name) for lunch. Several AT Hikers passed through while we were there, including two different young couples. Spirit Man also showed up as we finished our lunch and he joined us as we shared communion and sang songs of praise. 
It was more of the same for the final seven miles of the hike.  At the 10.5 mile mark, we reached the side trail leading to Peck’s Corner Shelter, where we would camp for the night. The shelter was another half mile down the wet, slushy, muddy trail. To think, we don’t even get to take credit for that half mile in, or out! When we arrived at the shelter at about 5PM, Close Call and Heartburn were already there along with several other hikers. There was still ample room on the top shelf of the cool, damp shelter, so WW and I staked out a spot. Before long, more hikers would roll in, feeding the 12-person shelter to capacity. 
It was good to finally get our cold, wet shoes and socks off and get a hot meal in us. Despite the cool temps, we were both warm and cozy once we crawled into our bags. Everyone has settled in now and the shelter is quiet, with the exception of mice I hear scampering in the rafters. I hope they don’t decide to help themselves to some down from my quilt.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585022,"“Darrell, Darrell...” In my dream, Which Way was next to me in the shelter whispering in my ear. Just as the dreamy whisper and a gentle nibble on my earlobe aroused my senses, stirring me awake, Which Way scurried off. Wait! That wasn’t WW. It was a furry little creature. Okay little mouse, you can break my heart, but please don’t take my down out of my quilt! Needless to say, I didn’t sleep much more after my rendezvous with the little ear sniffer. 

We woke to frigid temperatures and frozen shoes. The last thing we did before leaving the shelter was put on our wet socks and then our ice boxes (a.k.a our Hiking Shoes). I normally take care to ensure my feet and shoes are free of debris, my socks are pulled up tight, and my shoes are properly laced. This morning, with muddy, frozen shoes and frost-nipped fingers, I was just happy to just get my puppies in and start walking. We hiked the 1/2 mile back to the A.T., stopping to fill our water bladders along the way, and finally hitting the trail at 9:00. 
The day started with three ascents and descents, with each climb taking us a little higher in elevation the last. The trail surface was good, by yesterday’s standards, and we started out making good time (frozen feet and all). At the top of the first hill we paused at a vista named Eagle’s Rocks. We were basically walking in the clouds, which limited our view. But, being at a high point, I toggled my phone off airplane mode to check for a signal. We had zero reception at the shelter last night and I was unable to upload yesterday’s journal entry. Happily the signal was fairly strong on Eagle’s Rocks, so I uploaded the entry and some pics taken the day before. While I was uploading, notifications and texts started appearing on my phone. It was then that I received the news of the passing of my Aunt Virginia.  
Aunt Virginia was the epitome of strength and resilience, fighting hard in her battle against cancer and overcoming more trials than any person should have to bear in a lifetime. She did so much more than conquer frozen mountains and any other challenges this trail has, and will throw our way. Please pray for her son David, his wife, Jade, and “GiGi’s” three lovely granddaughters—the lights of her life.  With the passing of my Aunt Virginia, my parents, grandparents, and all of my aunts and uncles have gone on to their final resting place. It is a reminder to me that life is precious and I should be thankful and embrace each and every day. My Aunt Virginia did that in spades, regardless of what life threw her way. 
The second and third climbs took us above 6,000’ and the trail conditions once again deteriorated. We were forced to choose between skating on the icy trail or breaking through crusty patches of snow that accumulated just off the path. The going was slow, but we pressed on, stopping to get water and eat lunch about seven miles into our hike. Shortly after resuming our hike I noticed the previously frosty branches on the vegetation lining the trail had thawed. Minutes later we were walking through a grove of tall evergreen trees and big drops of water fell from the branches of the thawing giants. Soon, the sun began to pierce through the clouds. I cannot begin to explain how good a little ray of sunshine feels on a wet or cold hike.  
With about four miles left to go until we reached our shelter, we started a steady decline, taking us below 5,000’. Although the air was warming, the terrain was rocky, causing our feet to slide in our shoes. I was feeling a little hot spot on my left toe, which is unusual for me. With about two miles to go, we found a good spot in the sun to sit down and grab a snack. I decided to take off my shoes and socks that I had hurriedly put on this morning, thinking that a crinkle in my sock was the culprit. No crinkle, just a big hole. Caused by what? The insole was missing from my left shoe!! When I take my shoes off at night I pull my insoles about halfway out to help with the drying process. I guess the left insole got knocked out during the night and I somehow missed it this morning when shoving my cold feet into frozen shoes. Now I have my first blister, one less sock, and a shoe issue. Hopefully I can get some inserts tomorrow when we come to a hostel. Otherwise, it is another 45 miles to Hot Springs, and a solution. 

When we got to the shelter I had a good signal and was able to call my cousin David. It was good to hear his voice. Rest in Peace, Aunt Virginia, you have fought the good fight and have won the race.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585085,"An INCREDIBLE hiking day today!!! Got out around 8:25 this morning so we could get to Standing Bear Farm in time to catch a shuttle into town to get Next Step an insert for his hiking shoe. Next Step and I had agreed that if we had to pay for a shuttle we would just stay in town. Now don’t get me wrong, I have developed a strong fondness for my fellow hikers, but the thoughts of sharing a bunkhouse with 19 other hikers did not sound appealing. As Next Step previously mentioned, shelters are mandatory in the Smokies. Last night was no exception. As I laid there for what seemed like HOURS listening to the 16 other snorers at different levels and intervals, it took all of my self-control not to sit up and yell at the top of my lungs, “WOULD EVERYONE PLEASE ROLL OVER ON THEIR SIDES!!?!?!?”. But I was able to refrain. Can only imagine what my trail name would have been if that had happened!! We had about 10.5 miles to hike and we weren’t sure how the conditions would be today. We were in for an amazing surprise...THE SNOW AND ICE WAS FINALLY GONE!!! Started off with a bit of an uphill and then down, down, down. I was praying that my knees would hold up. But with the sun shining brightly, nothing could get my spirits down today. I was just so thankful that we were almost out and it was all I could do not to run down the mountain! I’m not going to whine, but I’m not going to sugarcoat it either, I was a bit traumatized by the snow storm!! I had to psyche myself up to get back out there on Sunday. And then when we still had ice on the trail yesterday, I really couldn’t get out of the Smokies fast enough. 
As we came out we had an even bigger surprise...Smokey Mountain Angel!!!! She was a trail angel set up just as we left the National Park and had a big cooler filled with Cokes and Mountain Dews. She had Reese’s Cups, Milky Ways, powder donuts, chips, Slim Jim’s, and every other kind of snacks known to mankind!!!!! It was JUST what I needed to push on to Standing Bear Farm.  After we posed for a You-tube video that Smokey Trail Angel was posting, we said our good-byes and pressed on. After heading up the other side of the road we were rewarded once again for our day’s journey! A complete 180 from the snow storm we faced less than a week ago! The trail meandered through the woods following a rushing mountain stream. The birds were chirping, the sun was shining, and a perfect breeze was blowing. There were small white, yellow and purple wildflowers blooming and we even saw our first butterflies of the season. I just can’t imagine a more perfect scenario!! I hope that I would have appreciated it anyway. But I can only think that it seemed even more amazing because of the trials we faced last week! And isn’t that how it goes?!?
Soon we started hearing a sound we hadn’t heard in a long time...the sound of an interstate! We would cross I-40 today, our first interstate! All of these firsts!!! We then hiked up, up, up to get to the gravel road leading to the hostel. A guy was sitting there in a van and asked if we wanted a ride up. Hello?!?!?! We jumped in, Next Step in the front with the two Boston Terriers, and in just a matter of minutes we arrived at the hostel. The hostel owner, Maria, assured us that she would find Next Step an insert, so we made the mature decision to NOT go to town. I hate when we act so responsibly!!!!!! But we didn’t have to stay in the bunk house. Instead, we will tent camp next to the stream!!! Now THAT is the sound that will put me right to sleep. This place is awesome!!! I even got to wash my clothes on a washboard!!! My mom will be so proud.  
We had the best frozen pizza for lunch, and Next Step is going to whip us up some eggs, sausage and toast for supper. Just before we started to cook it up, Rhino, one of the employees, handed Next Step a Walmart bag with some new inserts!

 I just can’t imagine a better day of hiking! 
Finally, we hung with our core hiking group throughout the Smokies—Close Call, Spirit Man, and Heartburn. We also camped with some new acquaintances the past couple of nights—Flint & Steel,  Fin & Happy Feet, and a hiker named Mel from Sydney, Australia. It may be a temporary thing, you just never can tell.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585203,"At the Standing Bear Hostel we were the King and Queen of our domain. Our tent was pitched on a flat grassy surface, we had access to running water, and even a kitchen. However, when we returned to the trail, we were quickly reminded who was boss. The first 4.5 miles consisted of a steady ascent of 2,500’ to the top of Snowbird Peak. At least the ground beneath our feet was soft and a breeze cooled us off on an otherwise warm day. At the top of Snowbird we were rewarded with noticeably cooler temps and astonishing views. There was also something that looked a bit out of place at the top, a building, something that resembled a space ship, and, what’s that, a car. Another hiker informed us that it was an intermediate air traffic control station, filling the gaps between large airports. Snowbird Peak was not the last climb of the day. 
Close Call had told us the night before that he was pushing 13 miles to Max Patch, an iconic A.T. Bald, where he planned to setup camp. Our original plan called for a 7 mile hike to the first shelter, followed by 13 miles on both Thursday and Friday to take us to Hot Springs. But, we decided to follow Close Call’s lead. Not only would it offer us a great opportunity to linger on Max Patch, it would also leave us with only 20 miles to Hot Springs. On the downside (or is it the upside?) we still had two significant climbs before we would make it to Max Patch, after a final ascent.

 We stopped to filter water and eat lunch at around one o’clock. The stream had a weak, disbursed flow, so I placed a broad Rhododendron leaf under a rock to funnel water into our 4 liter Gravity Works “dirty” bag. I will post some pics if you want to see how the system works. So far, we love it.
5 1/2 grueling miles later we were at the base Max Patch, and WW was maxed out. We stopped briefly at a stream to filter more water for the evening/morning before proceeding on. I was hoping euphoria would kick in, fueling WW to the top. It did! Just a short distance after getting water, we exited the dense vegetation that was obstructing our view. Then, it opened up, in all its glory! An immense grassy mound lay before us. Never mind the 200’ ascent and stairs leading to the top, WW was already there. The trail continued along the open field for another half mile before coming to the peak. Once again, we were rewarded for our effort, as we were simply awestruck by vast openness and an amazing panoramic view. Layers upon layers of mountains and hills in all directions. They were stacked up like ocean waves rolling into the beach. Awesome!!! 
Trail magic too? Yes, Veins, a 1991 thru hiker, had a cooler full of beer and some hotdogs. We passed on the beer, but gladly accepted a pack of hotdogs, buns, and potato chips. After a few pics, a short video, and a few minutes to just take it in, we found a spot just off the windy mountain top to set up camp, and cook up our hotdogs. We were joined by Close Call, Heartburn, and Twofer (a hiker we met yesterday).  
I climbed back to the top for some sunset pictures before hitting the sack. Tired, but smiling on the inside, we were fast to sleep. What a day!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585293,"When we rolled out of our tent for a nature call during the middle of the night, the moon lit up Max Patch and the stars were sprinkled against the vast sky. With the wind, altitude and low humidity, we missed out on a golden opportunity to sleep under the stars. Our bodies still recovering from the previous day’s hike featuring our biggest miles and largest elevation gain, we slept in a little later than usual. When I opened my eyes to the light of dawn, I crawled out of the tent just as the sun was rising over the mountains to the east. 

With the wind blowing hard over the grassy Max Patch, we decided to pack everything up and hit the trail before eating breakfast. We were the last of the hikers from the small group tented on the north side of Max Patch to get going this morning. Just as we were making our way through the open field to the trail, Flint and Steel came down from the top and we fell in behind them.  
Now in the woods and protected from the wind, we stopped at a stream crossing about a mile into our hike to filter water, cook breakfast, and stretch. Several hikers streamed by as we were taking care of business. We would leap frog with many of the same hikers throughout the day. We usually take time to try to converse with fellow hikers. The group we have traveled among since leaving Gatlinburg has been awesome. Most of the hikers we have met lately have been much younger, yet they still gladly give us old folks the time of day. Indeed, a very pleasant group of young adults. 
The trail continued to slope gently down for another 4.5 miles, making this the easiest 5 mile stretch of trail we have had so far. Plus, the weather was great and water sources were plentiful as we frequently crossed streams the entire day. Just when we thought it couldn’t get better, at the bottom of the descent we came to a dirt road and, you guessed it, Trail Magic. This time it came from “Sherpa Matt” who was pulling a truck bed converted into a trailer behind his vehicle. I had seen that same trailer at Unicoi Gap and at least one other place. We took two oranges off of Matt’s hands and gave him a couple of bucks to cover his cost. 
Our first climb took us up about 800’ to the top of Walnut Mountain, with its grassy dome. It was time for lunch when we reached the top. We could see a shelter sitting in the trees just over the crest, but we opted to occupy a spot at the top, where we could soak up the warm sun. After lunch we took a picture of the cute little Walnut Mountain Shelter and the group of hikers stopped there for a break.

After a short descent, we once again started to gain altitude. This time we would rise about 1,000 feet to the top of Bluff Mountain. The only thing difficult about the climb was that the temperature was now near 70 degrees. To think, this time last week we were plowing through 3-foot snow drifts and just three mornings ago our fingers and toes were half frozen when we started our hike. If you don’t like the weather on the AT, just keep hiking! There was a cluster of boulders marking the top of Bluff Mountain. We perched on top of the highest rock and ate the orange we got from Sherpa Matt. We then hopped down from the rock and stretched a little before taking off again. Just as we were about to depart, the same group of five young hikers and a beautiful white dog, Oden, came up and took our place on the boulders. 
The last few miles, a 2,500 foot descent, was the toughest part of the day. Simply put, the feet heat up quite a bit on a long decline under the weight of a pack. I had hoped to make it to the bottom and then start looking for a place to stealth camp on the modest hill beyond. But, with about 1.5 miles remaining, Which Way’s puppies were barking hard. We stopped to get water at a stream crossing and she removed her shoes to soak her burning feet in the cold mountain water. Heartburn showed up at about the same time and was also spent. As I finished filtering water. I sent WW ahead with HB to look for the first suitable spot to camp. About a half mile down the trail, the AT crossed an old logging road and there it was, our not so stealth camping spot. At least it is flat and on good ground in case it rains hard as forecasted.  
About an hour after we arrived, the group of young hikers we had leap frogged with all day came through our not so stealth campsite. A couple of them said they were hiking seven more miles into Hot Springs. The others were just shooting for the next shelter, about 4 miles down the trail. It is hiker midnight now and Heartburn just yelled from his tent that Close Call texted to let us know that he was in Hot Springs eating a cheeseburger. That rascal! And about that time the raindrops started falling on our tent. Sweet dreams.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585350,"Usually, my least favorite sound on the trail is the early morning “woooooossshhhh” emanating from Next Step’s sleeping mat as he loosens the valve, letting the air escape. Why? Because that means it’s time for me to crawl out of my nice warm sleeping bag and start packing up for the daily hike. But this morning, when the sound came at 6:15 AM, it was music to my ears...it’s TOWN DAY!!! We only had a 7.5 mile hike to get to Hot Springs, NC. TO add to the excitement our son recently had reminded me of the amazing milkshakes we had gotten there the last time we visited the town. If we got up and got going, I could be drinking one of those delicious treats before noon!! Even though it had rained hard during the night, it had stopped a few hours before my “alarm” went off, which also meant that we didn’t have to pack up in the rain!! We ate our breakfast quickly, packed up and were on the trail by 7:20, a record starting time so far. We only had a few climbs today and several significant descents, so we were able to make some really good time, even though it started to rain again soon after we started hiking. After we passed over the last ascent, I spotted the first two deer we have seen so far. Next Step was trying to get out the camera to get their picture, but I must have startled them when I said, “I JUST SAW TWO DEER!!!!” I’m not exactly the stealthiest hiker in the woods, but I’m thinking that will come in handy when we get to bear country. Lol 
As we came down the last descent, we could see the town of Hot Springs just below us. I “smelled the barn” and picked up the pace even more. Hot Springs is the first town that we have actually hiked into. The trail runs through the heart of this historical little town nestled in the western North Carolina Mountains. It sits between Spring Creek and the French Broad River and features a 100 acre resort spa with mineral waters. The sidewalk leading through town has the AT emblem engraved in marble about every 50 feet. It is clearly a hiker friendly town. It is currently the leading edge of the hiker bubble, which evidently began to arrive in mass yesterday.  Following the AT markings for a short distance, we arrived at the Smokey Mountain Diner by 11:00 AM and I had already ordered my cheeseburger and onion rings!!!! We heard the Hillbilly Market had the best milkshakes in town (the restaurant where we had gotten them several years before had closed) so I would have to wait until later in the afternoon to satisfy my craving!!! Just something else to look forward to!!  
We have family meeting us here tomorrow, and we have a cabin reserved for Saturday - Monday. We were thinking we would stay in a hostel tonight, but fortunately the cabin was made available a day early. They weren’t quite ready for us to check in, so we thought it would be the perfect time to go to the laundromat to get that chore taken care of. We got all of our stinky hiking clothes washed and then noticed that NONE of the seven dryers in the facility actually worked. No problem. We walked up the hill to find our “home away from home” for the weekend and were happy to find a quaint log cabin with a clothesline out back. PERFECT! Next Step got all of our wet laundry hung up while I got my shower. I worked on getting our dishes washed up while he got his shower. He asked me to grab him a shirt off the line. I went out to get it, only to find that it had started raining again. Not so perfect!!! I grabbed a few things off the line and brought them in, hoping they would be dry before we headed back to town to visit the local outfitter and get our milkshakes. Unfortunately, we had to make our trek wearing only our rain gear. But it’s a hiker town so they’re used to it! 

We brought our purchases back up to the cabin and turned around and walked back to town to meet Close Call and Heartburn for supper. The Spring Creek Tavern is obviously the place to eat. When we walked in, it was packed! We had to wait several minutes to get a table. They are famous for their mozzarella cheese sticks?!? What can be so special about a cheese stick? Well, when they’re as big as a corn dog and filled with cheese and salami and served with an incredible marinara sauce, they are something to get excited about, especially when you had to walk 34 days to get them!! Of course, we also had some pizza. But don’t fret, we shared a giant salad before our pizza arrived so there was SOMETHING healthy in there. Now we’re back at the cabin trying to finish our hiker chores. Our son is driving up tonight from Arkansas to join us for the weekend and Next Step’s stepmom and his sister will be here tomorrow. So excited for some family time!! Just wishing our daughter, her boyfriend and our son’s wife could be here as well. That would be a perfect weekend! Just have to brag a minute...Our daughter is actually on her way back to her university in CO after spending the last few days in Long Beach, CA, for a Sociology conference. She was chosen to present her Senior Project at the conference!! We are beyond proud!!!  
Wishing all of you a happy Easter and feeling blessed to be where we are at this moment!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585439,"Our son, Patrick, finally arrived around 1:30 AM. It was great to see him, but we were all very tired and quickly found our way to bed. After sleeping off the late night, we made our way down to the Smokey Mountain Diner for breakfast, featuring their famous cinnamon rolls. The diner has “hikers welcome” written all over it, from the AT mural painted on one wall, to the friendly wait staff, to the menu selection (e.g. Hungry Hiker Breakfast), to the fact that they stamp AT Passports. 

After breakfast we returned to the house to await the arrival of my sister and stepmom. I was out back doing some gear maintenance when I heard a commotion in the house. Which Way called me in and introduced me to the man standing in the foyer. Stan was a friendly local man, a bit older than us, who had been following us on our Journal. Piecing together clues from yesterday’s journal entry, he was able to figure out where we were staying, the final clue being the Arkansas license plate on Patrick’s vehicle. He knocked on the door and when Which Way answered he said, “I can’t believe it, I finally found Which Way and Next Step!” We chatted for about 45 minutes, during which time he reminded us of details from our journey that we had forgotten. He also asked a few questions about missing details. At the end of our conversation he asked if there was anything he could do for us and offered up a prayer on our behalf. The whole ordeal was very uplifting and reinforced one very special element of life on the trail—how it brings strangers together to create lasting memories. Before Stan left I gave him one of our “trail cards” to show his wife when he got back home. It was proof that he really found us. 
Shortly after Stan departed, two very special Trail Angels showed up--my sister, Lisa, and stepmom, Irene. And they arrived with enough food to feed a hiker army! When Patrick saw all that they had brought he commented, “I thought we were only staying until Monday?!?” We wanted to show them the Tavern where we had enjoyed our pizza and cheese sticks last night. So as soon as we got everything carried inside and put away, we headed to town. Again, we were not disappointed. Lisa, Irene and I ordered the Special, which was gumbo. We were expecting a cup, maybe even a bowl. But when the server arrived with our food, we each had three heaping plates full of gumbo. And there was twice as much on my plate as there was on their plates. I guess they could guess by my scruffy appearance that I was a hiker and needed a “little” extra fuel. It was the first time since we’ve started our hike that I couldn’t clean my plate. Patrick and I stayed in town and did a little shopping at the Outfitter while the girls headed a few miles away to find the nearest Ingles. They had gone to the Hillbilly Market to get a few supplies but couldn’t bring themselves to pay $12 for a gallon and a half of milk. (And that’s after Lisa had already picked up a half gallon and had proceeded to drop it, spilling milk everywhere!) 
We all met back at the cabin and played a game of Catan—it’s a family tradition. We invited Close Call and Heartburn to our cabin for burgers, brauts, and all the fixings. They showed up just as we were finishing our game. After gorging ourselves, we hung out for a couple of hours. When they were ready to leave I drove them back to the Laughing Heart Hostel, loading them down with leftovers for other hungry hikers. When I dropped them off, they made a beeline for a group of hikers gathered around a fire pit. The army would soon be fed.
Back at the cabin, we played games and enjoyed the company of our family, turned Trail Angels, late into the night.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585543,"What an AMAZING day! 
I know that these last few days will carry me through many miles of hiking! As we mentioned, we were so blessed to be able to have a double zero with our son, Next Step’s Stepmom, Irene, and his sister, Lisa. There are really no words to describe how wonderful our time together has been! Well, technically yesterday wasn’t a Zero. Next Step, Patrick and I got up and did about a 5.5 hike on the AT yesterday morning (after eating orange-glazed cinnamon rolls to get us going—thank you Lisa). It was so fun to have Patrick be with us as we hiked. We stopped at a beautiful overlook to do our worship and I could barely hold back the tears of joy as we held hands to pray together. We ran into a couple of trail angels as we finished our hike. Dolly Llama and Lightning Man (who told us that he had been struck by lightning 12 times!!!) who were handing out fruit, Easter candy and sodas. We chatted with them a minute and then headed back to the cabin where Irene and Lisa were putting together an absolutely INCREDIBLE Easter lunch!!! 
We opened the door and the smells were almost overwhelming! We invited Spirit Man and Heartburn to join us. It’s a good thing we did, because there was enough way too much food for us to eat without a little help from our tramily. We had honey baked ham, mashed potatoes and gravy, pineapple casserole, squash casserole, green beans, Lisa’s famous deviled eggs, rolls, and of course peach cobbler, brownies, lemon cake and cookies for dessert. I could barely move when we were finished. But I knew I would be hungry again in just a few hours. And I would definitely be thinking “I wish I had eaten one more...fill in the blank” when Monday night rolls around and I am back to my freeze-dried food - YUCK!! Everyone ate to their hearts content and we all shared trail stories over the feast. After Heartburn and Spirit Man left, Next Step and I had to finish our hiker chores while everyone else napped from their full bellies. We got most of our stuff ready to go and by then everyone was ready for more games (and popcorn and peanut m&m’s). 
Around 6:00 we decided it was time for more ham so we made some sandwiches with guacamole and chips. And we couldn’t miss one last opportunity for some warm cookies and milk before bedtime. I really can’t remember ever eating so much in one day. And I know I’ll be ready to eat some more when I get up in the morning. But even after all we ate, there was a TON of food left over, so we boxed it all up and took it to the hiker hostel. I’m pretty sure it didn’t last very long after we made the drop! Also pretty sure Next Step and I will be not be moving very fast when we try to drag those full bellies up the mountain though!! We had both already lost quite a few pounds before the weekend, but I don’t think that’s the case anymore. Don’t worry, another week of hiking and of me trying to choke down trail food and I’ll be slim and trim again in no time. 

I already miss our family and they haven’t even left yet. But I’ll be rethinking of all the memories we made this weekend for a LONG time and that is what will get me through until we can be reunited with ALL of our family. Just know you’re ALWAYS in my thoughts and prayers.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585621,"We kicked the day off with some breakfast burritos. It was a fitting end to a food-filled weekend. Patrick got on the road shortly after breakfast and we were close behind. Irene and Lisa dropped us by the Post Office before hauling us up to Tanyard Gap, where we would resume our hike. It was about 10:45 when we said our goodbyes and entered the brown forest. The trail was gentle under our feet and our initial ascent was mild. Nonetheless, with full packs and stuffed bellies, we struggled to find our stride. 
There were signs of life amidst the tall grey trees and brown undergrowth. A cluster of tiny purple or white flowers would occasionally appear. Squirrels and chipmunks were busy digging up hickory nuts and pecans they had stored before winter. Sounds of birds chirping and woodpeckers jack-hammering against hollowed trees rang through the air.  When we stopped to stretch, a hiker from Wyoming named Cowboy came by. We would leap frog with him several times before leaving him at Spring Mtn. Shelter, where we stopped for lunch. A couple of other hikers dropped by and we successfully transferred some excess Easter candy and leftover cookies from our packs to their bellies. One of the hikers was named Slider. She carried a plastic trombone in a case strapped to her pack. Slider mentioned that the chocolate chip cookies tasted like the ones that came with a big box of leftover Easter Dinner that arrived at the Laughing Heart Hostel the night before. Another hiker agreed. That would be the box that we dropped off last night. Irene and Lisa: your Trail Magic lore lives on. We also saw Life Alert. The last time we saw her was on a cold night at Sassafrass Shelter. She had major gear issues, leaving her quite cold that night. Evidently she got all of her issues resolved and is doing much better. I was happy to see that she had persevered and was doing finding her stride.
Although the hike was not too difficult by AT standards, Which Way’s knee was hurting again when going downhill. She changed out of her hiking shoes to her trail running shoes at Hot Springs, so that may be the issue. She is going to switch inserts tomorrow to see if that helps. To make matters worse, her shoulder was bothering her under the weight of a heavy pack. We decided to exit the trail at Log Cabin Road and stay at the Hemlock Hollow Inn—a place a couple of miles east (in Tennessee) that offered a bunkhouse and cabins. We had called ahead from Spring Mtn. Shelter (about five miles out) and set up a free shuttle from the gravel road to Hemlock Hollow. A couple of miles out, WW was really struggling, holding back tears from the pain, and I realized we would not make the pick-up time at the pace we had slowed to. There was no cell service or any other way to contact the Hemlock Hollow to let them know we would be late. So, when WW stopped and removed her pack to stretch a little, I opened it up, took out the heavy food bag and strapped it to my pack, before she had a chance to object. I then raced ahead to make the pick-up time (within the +/- 5mins I gave them). Waiting at the spot was James and his girlfriend. I apologized for being a couple of minutes late, loaded my pack in the back of their truck, and went back down the trail to retrieve WW (and her pack). James was the son of the Hemlock Hollow Inn’s owner/proprietor, Diane. The nice fellow had us to the nice little retreat in the woods in a jiffy. 
Once there, we met Diane and she set us up with a quaint little cabin sitting adjacent to a mountain stream. We took quick showers and returned to the Inn’s country store and were eating frozen pizza and ice cream. Diane was very accommodating and prepared an ice bag for WW’s knee. Hopefully tomorrow’s hike will be pain-free for Which Way.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585726,"The tiny cabin was dark, the mattress was firm, and the stream just below us provided perfect natural background noise. All of this resulted in us sleeping a little later than usual. We enjoyed cold cereal from our little abode before packing up and heading to the camp store for a lift back to the trail. I had picked up some dried kiwi from the Hillbilly Market back in Hot Springs and decided to give them a try with my breakfast. I had barely bit through the first piece of kiwi before the awful flavor invaded my taste buds.  “This tastes like fish!” I exclaimed to Which Way.
Diane gave us a ride back to the trail, dropping us off at 10:00. We did a little dynamic (vs static) stretching and started the 2,500’ ascent that would span the first five miles of our hike. The first few miles were relatively easy and Which Way was feeling none of the pain that dogged her the day before. We stopped at the Little Laurel Shelter to get some water and use the privy. It had to be the most pathetic privy we have come across (see pic), but at least it didn’t smell too bad. There were about half a dozen other hikers at the shelter who were also refueling. This was my big chance to drop the last pound of Easter snacks in my food bag. “Does anyone want any Snicker Eggs?” All hands went up. “How about some Reese’s Cups?” Score! Really feeling lucky now, I pulled out the bag with what remained of the dried kiwi. Holding the bag up, I said, “I really don’t like these, but if anyone else is interested.” The hiker next to me took me up on my offer. As he was putting it in his mouth, I said, “It tastes like...” “Fish,” he said, finishing my thought. To my surprise, and delight, the next hiker in line said, “I’ll try one.” Immediately after chomping down, he muttered, “This is awful!” Remarkably, two more hikers tried it, the last one offering the most accurate review, “This is the worst thing I’ve tasted on the trail!”  
Our fellow hikers were still gagging on the aftertaste of the fish fruit when we walked away from the shelter. The remaining ascent was fairly steep and seemed more difficult than usual under the warm sun. Having sucked down our water pretty quickly we stopped to refill from a pipe spring just beyond the crest of the mountain. From there it was a short, albeit rocky hike to Whiterock Cliff, where we stopped for lunch. Perched atop the massive rock wall (elev. 4,444’) and looking south, we counted eight layers of mountain ranges. It was a beautiful sight and a satisfying feeling to think that we had hiked over a good portion of the terrain in our gaze. 
The elevation profile depicted on the Guthook App and on AWOLs AT Guide looked pretty tame for the remainder of the hike. But, the absence of huge ascents and descents does not necessarily equal easy hiking. For instance, the profile does not account for the type of trail surface or repeating near verticals ups and downs of 5-20 feet. So, what looked like an easy mile over Firescald Knob, ended up being our longest mile on the trail thus far. We worked our way up and over jagged boulders and through rock crevices as we navigated along a narrow ridge line. This section of the trail resembled Bear Fence Mountain, a short rock scramble in the Shenandoah National Park. The difference is that the Bear fence Mountain Trail is a blue-blazed side path, not on the AT. Although working through the maze of boulders with full packs was arduous, it was a lot of fun and offered some amazing views. We were literally skirting the NC-TN border and had grand views of both states on parts of Firescald. It was one of several elements that made this a great day.
Soon after exiting the labyrinth of rocks and boulders the trail softened, with grass lining the edges, and meandered along gentle rolling terrain. This is the type of terrain we relish every step of, always knowing that it won’t last long. Nearly lulled to sleep by the meandering path, we almost missed the 300 mile mark. Wow, have we really come that far? A short distance ahead stood Jerry’s Cabin Shelter, where we would tent for the night. It was a little before 5PM when we arrived. We found a good spot to set up camp about 150 meters beyond the shelter. I counted about a half dozen hikers in the shelter and about a dozen tents in the area. So far, we have managed to stay ahead of the big bubble of hikers that clogs the trail behind us. Let’s hope it stays that way. After all the chores and evening stretching were complete we cooked up a yummy batch of rigatoni, salami, sun dried tomatoes, basil and olive oil. It was the first dish we cooked from scratch. Life Alert happened by and we shared some extra salami slices with her. I had no more fish fruit to offer. She left happy. 
Although our bodies and feet were tired from a strenuous hike, all in all, it was a good day. It appears that it will take a few miles before we adjust to our trail running shoes that we switched to in Hot Springs. Until then, we will just have to take it easy.  The best news from a great day, Which Way did not suffer any knee pain. Prayers answered!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585792,"The thunderstorm rolled in at 3AM, ushering in cold air and gusting winds. At daybreak it was still rainy, windy, and very cold. We were in no hurry and decided to stay put in our warm tent a little longer. By 9AM we were getting restless and started packing up from inside our tent. This sounds easy enough, but our tent is snug with two bodies lying horizontally and it is difficult to sit up without your head hitting the tent ceiling. 

Add two backpacks, with elbows flying as we try to roll up sleeping pads, change clothes, and stuff everything into our backpacks. Well, you get the picture. I pulled my pack in from the vestibule first and loaded it up. By the time I got out to make room for Which Way to do the same, the rain had stopped. But, it was still cold, damp and windy, a far cry from the 70 degree temps we had the day before. As WW finished packing, I went to retrieve the food bags, which were hanging from a nearby tree. I used the PCT method to secure the bags out of a hungry bear’s (and my) reach. (google “PCT method for hanging bear bag” for a visual) When I went to pull the standing end of the nylon line, I realized the stick I used to keep the line from sliding though the snap link was stuck. Apparently the heavy winds that blew during the night had caused the rock sack to get intertwined with the stick and the carabiner. After a fruitless effort to untangle the mess I stacked some logs and rocks to the point where I could almost reach the bottom of one of the bags. I wondered, what would a bear do in this situation? He would probably jump up and grab the bags, swinging above the ground until the line or the branch 20 feet above broke and came crashing down. I did not particularly like that option. By now my hands were numb from being cold and wet. WW would be emerging from the tent soon, so I needed to come up with another plan quickly, as she dislikes standing around in the cold even more than I do. I presented WW with option 2, the one where she gets on top of my shoulders and tries to untangle the cold, wet mess dangling just out of reach. WW quickly nipped that one in the bud. Only one option remained for retrieving the food bags—cutting the line above the bags. I had an idea.   If I can pull this off, WW will be so impressed. If not! I had to stop thinking like a bear and started thinking like, uh McGuiver.  I quickly unraveled some duct tape I had wrapped around to my hiking poles for just such an emergency. Next, I used the tape to secure my pocket knife to the pointy end of the pole. Then, as WW held the line taught, I extended the knife above the tangle, and with one slide of the blade against the weighted down nylon line, two food bags fell to the ground. Who da man!?!
By the way, we love our Z-pack Food Bags. They are lightweight and super convenient. The Cuban fiber construction does a great job of holding in odor and keeping out moisture. However, I am not a big fan of the bear bagging rope kit that I purchased with my Z-pack. The nylon rope is difficult to work with when hoisting two full bags into the air and even more difficult to tie off. This task becomes exponentially harder in wet and cool conditions. Before we purchased our Z-packs, I used 550 cord to hang our bag and never had problems. With everything except the tent packed up, we hurried back up the trail to the shelter for breakfast. When we arrived, most of the occupants from the night before were still there, plus a few other tenters. Just as we were ready to go back down and pack the tent, Heartburn hiked in. Exhausted from the previous days hike, he had settled for a tent site about 2 miles out. Evidently Spirit Man was close behind, but we did not wait around for his arrival. 

By the time we got back to take our tent down, the wind had almost blown it dry. Minutes later we started our gradual ascent up the trail. It was nearly 11:00. Soon our core body would warm and feet and hands would follow. With the exception of a mini-scramble over Big Butt Mountain, the terrain (grade and footing) was the best we have experienced to this point of our hike. By the afternoon the sun was shining brightly and the winds calmed, making it a perfect hiking day. About 7 miles into our hike we stopped for lunch at Flint Mountain Shelter. Since the temperature was supposed to drop throughout the day, we decided to have a hot meal for lunch and pre-make some P&J wraps for dinner. We heated up our noodles, sun-dried tomatoes, olive oil and basil dish and poured it into our bowls over a base of tuna. We may be onto something with this contraption. It was around 2PM and several hikers from the previous night were already occupying shelter space or setting up their tents. Several hikers who arrived while we were eating did the same. When they realized that we were hiking on, one of the young hikers exclaimed, “You two are bad A” It was repeated by other hikers as we moved on. I replied that we have been called lots of things, but that had not been one of them.
The gentle trail continued with modest rises and falls. At one point we climbed stairs over a fence onto someone’s property. The sky was bright blue by now and we were feeling our new name. But don’t worry, it never take long for the trail to remind us who is boss. We eventually crossed a road and started a big ascent. There were four stream crossings with some cascading falls in the first half mile of the climb. The plan was to get above the last crossing and then start looking for a stealth site to tent. There were a group of hikers tenting after the first crossing. It looked like that would be cold and damp spot after the sun went down, so we opted to hike on. When we got to the last crossing I scooped up three liters of water that I would carry the rest of the way and filter after we found a place to camp. We were now switchbacking our way up a very steep mountain with no suitable place to tent. WW was about ready to pitch tent in the middle of the trail. I urged her on, “Keep moving sweetie, the trail will provide (hopefully before dark).” She reluctantly stayed with me and by 5:30 the trail hit a saddle (i.e. a piece of flat ground between two hilltops).  It was the perfect spot. We were high enough up that damp air would not be an issue and the sun hung above the mountain to our west, leaving ample time for us to change into dry clothes, set up our tent, and eat our wraps. I even heated up some water for hot tea. With WW snug in the tent, I found a short tree to pitch what was left of my line over and hoisted the food bags just out of reach of Yogi. Just as I was about to join WW in the tent, another hiker approached with a look of relief in his eye, glad to have happened on this spot. For him, and us, the trail provided.

That turned out to be a mistake. We had a pretty good climb, followed by a short descent, followed by another sizable climb. Protein bars are great, but they just don’t do what a nice hot meal can do for you. We even resorted to popping Skittles to get us up the second big climb. The sun was shining brightly and even though the temperatures were cool, we were shedding layers early to try and keep the sweating under control.  
We knew we would have two really tough days on Friday and Saturday to get us into Erwin, hopefully before the next round of bad weather hit, so I asked Next Step to pull out the trail guide before our last climb. I was trying to see if there was any way that we could try and add a few miles to our hike to put us in a better position for our hike into Erwin. We happily noticed on the guide that our hostel made another pickup about 2.5 miles past our original pickup point. Perfect!  It doesn’t sound like a lot, but when you know it’s going to be some hard ascents and descents, 2.5 miles less of hiking than you planned can make a big difference! The only problem was that the fuel from our protein bars had already run out and we were hiking slower than sloths wading through molasses. But just like that, an angel was just around the corner! As soon as we started to cross the highway at Sam’s Gap to start our extra miles, we saw a sign that said, “Uphill, scrambled eggs and hash browns, sodas, oranges, etc.” What is the one thing that will cause a hiker to hike UP a hill that is not on the AT?!?! Food!!!! We couldn’t get up that steep hill fast enough!!! There was an older gentleman waiting for us with his propane stove ready to go. Two other hikers had just finished their treat and were headed out. Buckeye, another hiker we just met, had just arrived as well. “Do you like eggs?” the older man asked. “YES!!!” we all three responded in perfect unison. Next Step asked him his name. “Paul.” He then asked if Paul had previously hiked the trail. “Yes, in 2007.” “What was your trail name?” asked Next Step. “Quiet Paul.” Fit him like a glove. However, he might not have been a man of many words, but his generosity spoke volumes!! He gave us a HEAPING plate of food!!! We found out he had been a stone mason from DC and had actually done the masonry for the East and West Towers of the National Cathedral in Georgetown. How cool?!?!  
Since we were blessed with the trail magic, we then made another responsible decision to forgo our shuttle to town and just eat hostel food and save our town food for our Zero this weekend in Erwin. After “preaching” deferred gratification to our kiddos for many years, I guess we actually learned something about that ourselves. It’s painful sometimes, but almost always a good decision. Lol 

We called the owners of Nature’s Inn when we were about .5 miles out to let them know we had hiked a little faster than we had expected, (am sure that was all because of the eggs and hash browns!!) in case they wanted to head on over to pick us up. We thought we only had to hike about 200 yards off the trail for our pickup point at Streets Gap, but as we headed down the gravel road looking for the paved road, Next Step called back the owners twice to make sure we were on the right road. It ended up being another .75 miles to reach the paved road. But “Rare Gem”, the hostel owner who picked us up, said that they would be happy to drive us all the way back up to the trail tomorrow. THANK GOODNESS! Those extra miles add up quickly and don’t even count for our daily total. We were in for a treat. Rare Gem was so personable and we chatted the whole trip to drop a couple of other hikers off before heading to Nature’s Inn. She even ran me by Ingle’s to grab a Coke Zero to take back to the hostel! We feel like we’re in Hiker Heaven here at the Inn. We have one of the three bedrooms in the “main house” which also has a bathroom, complete kitchen, living room and a washer and dryer!!!! Going to be hard to leave! Got in and got our showers and started the laundry. Now just getting ready to head up to the store to get some pizzas to cook for supper and get a few items for our resupply until we get to Erwin. A 69 year old hiker and his 70 year old best friend arrived shortly after us. They had stayed the night before and did some slack packing today. Finn and Happy Feet, a couple we met in the Smokies showed up a little later.  
It’s been an absolutely awesome day! And tonight I won’t even have to be worry about being awakened by those stinking owls in morning!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585956,"Bottom line up front - it was a heavenly day! Every day on the AT is a great day (at least for me), but today was over the top awesome! We departed Nature’s Inn at 8AM along with Finn and Happy Feet. Taft, the co-proprietor, was our shuttle driver. The first stop was Sam’s Gap, where we dropped Finn and Happy Feet. I noticed that Quiet Paul was setting up his kitchen at the top of the hill and recommended that they should get   some eggs and hash browns to start their hike. They agreed, so Taft drove them to the top of the hill. He then took Which Way and me to Street Gap. Thankfully, he navigated his Subaru up the rutty gravel road that we had to walk down yesterday.  
It was 38 degrees and sunny when we started our hike. The plan for the day was to hike at least half of the 22 miles to Erwin. With her craving for Mexican food still going strong, Which Way suggested that we hike to No Business Knob Shelter. Since it was nearly 16 miles away with four pretty big climbs, I responded that we should just set our sights on Spivey Gap (11 miles) and see how we feel. There were plenty of water sources between Spivey Gap and the shelter, so I figured we could just find a spot to stealth camp along the way. The forecast was calling for rain to move in around 5PM, so we wanted to be at camp by then. 
As we started our hike the temperature was perfect, the winds were light, and the skies were blue, except for a few wispy clouds. Our immediate goal was Big Bald Mountain. Although it was a 1,400 foot gain in elevation, the climb was spread over 4.5 miles and trail conditions were mostly ideal. The open forest offered an open field of vision and nice views. As we eased along a cut on the side of the mountain, Which Way stirred a small herd of deer just below the ridge above us. However, they did not all flee to safety. I got my camera out and slipped past WW in hopes of a better view. The deer did not disappoint. Instead, they kept a watchful eye on us as they continued to graze on a sprouting patch of vegetation.  As we slowly passed below we counted 8-10 deer.  Continuing on, we soon reached Big Bald, joyously working our way through the grassy field to the top. It was an awesome feeling to be standing at the top, just the two of us, with this magnificent mountain to ourselves. After taking a few minutes to celebrate the moment, and snap some photos, the cold wind pushed us along. The trail continued through open rolling fields for another mile or so. Before reentering the woods we saw our first hiker of the day, Murphy, a NOBO, who was headed south. He acknowledged that he was intentionally headed in the wrong direction, having decided to return to the top of Big Bald, where he would wait for others in his group to catch up and have lunch. 
The next mountain to conquer was Little Bald, where we would stop for lunch. Which Way came to a small clearing with a view, turned to me, and asked, “Table for two?” It was a great spot to take a break. From there we continued hiking past High Rocks, reaching Spivey Gap before 3PM. We took off our shoes, grabbed a quick snack, and contemplated our next move. Every mile we walked today would be a mile we would not have to hike in the rain tomorrow. To make a long story short, WW started hiking on what she dubbed “Heavenly Autopilot,” and we made it to No Business Knob Shelter just after 5PM. It started raining just moments after we arrived. 
We shared the six person shelter with five other hikers—Chip, 13, Sparrow, Impact and Zero. It was a great group. Chip and 13 were at the shelter when we arrived. Chip was the hiker who showed up at our stealth site two nights earlier. He confirmed today that he was happy to arrive at the site and find other hikers there. We met 13 today after lunch and hiked with him for a few miles. He started the trail on 21 March. When I asked him how he got his trail name, he said it was kind of a stupid reason. Someone noticed his small pack and asked him his base weight. He replied, “About 13 pounds.” Noting that he was making really good time, I asked him how he covered the 330 miles so quickly. He replied, “I hike about 20 miles a day and have not taken any zeros.” He added that he would try to make it to Maine without taking zeros. He was very unassuming about his mileage and no-zero plan. Most hikers out here are that way, truly living by the “hike your own hike” motto. I don’t know if there is any such thing as a “purist”, but 13 is the closest I’ve met and I wish him Godspeed in his quest. Knowing that we were headed to town tomorrow and that he was not resupplying until Roan Mountain, TN, I offered him a couple of tuna packets we would not immediately need. He graciously accepted.  
Sparrow arrived at the shelter about 30 minutes after us and was trying to decide whether to stay or go (she was actually singing the tune, “should I say or should I go now”). We saw her sitting at Whistling Gap earlier in the day preparing a cup of coffee. She told us she started the hike on 11 Feb, my birthday. She was bedded between 13 and WW. When we were all in our bags, I looked over and she was in an “L” shape, with her feet resting on the rafters. 13, then me, then WW, and then the other three hikers followed suit. Shelter yoga, you should try it sometime. Impact and Zero are brothers. A third brother had started with them, but had to go off the trail for a bit to take care of some business. Impact wants to have an impact on everyone he comes in contact with. He believes that each hiker is in control of their own mindset. He plans to write a book and be a motivational speaker someday. Zero was his much younger brother. He had a very deep voice but did not speak much, hence the name Zero.  
The chatter continued well past hiker’s midnight. The rain continued to fall. It was a glorious, heavenly day!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586067,"The rain fell through the night and into the morning at the No Business Knob Shelter. Nonetheless, its occupants were all business when dawn came. 13 took little time packing up and was the first out. Sparrow was close behind, followed by Which Way and me around 8:15. But before we departed, we watched Zero dump more than a dozen acorns from one of his boots. His brother, Impact, added another 1/2 dozen to the pile. Evidently, the chipmunks were busy last night. But we were all glad that the boots and acorns had kept them occupied all night. 
A light mist and heavy fog hung in the air as we started our descent to the Nolichucky River. Only stopping for our morning stretch and for a cloud obscured view of Erwin, we completed our 10Kish hike by 11. Uncle Johnny’s Hostel sat just off the trail on the Nolichucky River, a popular kayaking and rafting spot. The iconic hostel, whose owner (Johnny) passed away in February, was nearly full and was having major water issues. Therefore, I called The Cantarroso Farm and Apiary (bee farm) and was able to finagle a room in the proprietor’s house. We caught up briefly with Spirit Man, who had just shuttled in from Spivey’s Gap, then worked our way across the Nolichucky to wait for our ride. Peggy showed up a few minutes later and drove us to their beautiful farm, where everything was artsy, including the painted bee hives. The two really cute cabins sitting on the property were already rented by other hikers, so they let us stay in a spare room in their basement. The modest house was uniquely designed and well decorated, in a bee theme of course.  
After a quick shower, Peggy shuttled us into the town of Erwin. She pointed out the old Sears and Roebuck Catalogue Homes that lined the streets. The Craftsman-style homes were built back when Erwin was a booming railroad town. Erwin is infamously known as the town that hung an elephant. It happened in 1916 when the Charlie Sparks Traveling Circus was visiting nearby Kingsport, TN. As the story goes, Mary, the performing elephant, was put under the control of an inexperienced keeper, who jabbed Mary with a spear during a parade. The spear hit an abscess and Mary, reeling in pain, retaliated by pushing the keeper to the ground and stepping on his head. Not quite the end of the story. The residents were calling for blood, so the circus owner agreed to have “murderous Mary” killed. She was then brought to Erwin and hung from a railroad crane (see pic if you need evidence). It appears that Erwin is still trying to make amends for the sins of its fathers, as it held an “Elephant Revival” in 2016, donating the proceeds to an elephant refuge. Now there are painted elephant sculptures scattered throughout the town. 

Peggy delivered us to the heart of the surprisingly quaint downtown Erwin. Our first stop was the Hawg-N-Dawg, a BBQ joint recommended by Peggy’s husband, Mike. He did not fail us. The owner gave us personal service and the food was delicious! We both had a BBQ sandwich with sides and dessert. At first we ordered one of the KitKat Brownie A la modes. After a few bites, I called the server back over and said, “What were we thinking? We’ll take two!” 
After lunch we made our way to the old railway station that had been converted to a library. From there we were hoping to hang out at the downtown coffee shop, but it became apparent that they roll up the sidewalks by 3PM on Saturdays in Erwin. So, we settled for the McCafe located next to the Interstate. Heartburn and some other hikers were staying at the nearby Super 8 Hotel, so we texted to find out what they were doing for dinner. “Los Jalapeños, count us in!” A little later the shuttle driver swung by to pick us up. The driver, Doug, was delivering hikers here and there, accepting tips only. More trail magic!  Among the group at Los Jalapeños was Sky Water, who we had met a few days before while having lunch out on White Cliff Rocks. The food and service were great!

After dinner, Doug kindly dropped us off at the Food Lion, where we grabbed some breakfast items. From there Peggy picked us up and returned us to the Apiary. She invited us up for popcorn at 8PM, adding that the hikers staying in the cabins were also invited. When we came upstairs we were delighted to see Spamtown Rick and his girlfriend, Tamara, who was visiting from Minnesota for a few days. It was evident that Tamara was providing excellent home-base support, sending Rick resupply packages and setting him up in town accommodations. She was planning to visit him at several places along the trail, where she would stay a few days and even shuttle him to/from trailheads for day hikes. D2 and Crazy Brit also stopped by. They were the two hikers we met at Nature’s Inn a couple of nights ago. They are doing some day hikes (aka Slack Packing) while Crazy Brit’s shin splints heal. WW and I had a great conversation with D2, an avid hiker, biker, skier, and kayaker. He has hiked internationally on some really cool trails. D2 is also in the same league as Evil Kenevil when it comes to broken bones incurred from his escapades.  
It was another great day on the AT...making memories, building relationships and counting blessings. Tomorrow we ZERO!

Today was our Zero and we were looking forward to a nice relaxing day, but for those of you who know us, know that we barely know how to spell RELAX, much less put the word to practice. Yesterday we had looked for a church that Next Step had found on Google Maps, but when we tried to locate it, there was only an empty lot at the address that was given. However, this morning when we got up, I tried to find one and Erwin Church of Christ popped right up. It was about 4 miles away, so I called and left a message asking if someone could come pick us up. Just a short while later, my phone rang and the minister there, Jeff, let us know that he would be there at 9:30, no problem. The GPS didn’t bring him quite to where we were staying, but we were able to walk up to the main road so that he could find us. When we went out to meet him, we noticed that the mountains were snow covered. So thankful that we were down here where the ground was not frozen. 
On the way to church, Jeff informed us that today was Friends and Family Day and that we were invited to stay for the potluck after worship service. Also, for those of you who know me, know that I’m a germaphobe and normally don’t exactly enjoy pot lucks. However, after 43 days on the trail, BRING IT! But that would not be in the cards today. We told him that sounded great, but that Stan, the sweet gentleman that had “found” us in Hot Springs had already asked what our plans were for the day and we had asked if he would like to have lunch with us. Side note, the preacher asked if we would let other hikers know that when they’re in the area, he is more than happy to come pick them up for services. Super friendly congregation and very welcoming! 
We had a bit of a mix up with Stan, but were finally able to reach him to let him know where to pick us up. When he got there we all agreed that Italian sounded great for lunch, so he drove us over to Primo Italian. On the way he asked me to look in the cooler that was sitting beside me and inside was an ice cold Coke Zero!!!! And look, under the cooler, a giant pack of Skittles!!! Now there’s s man who pays attention to details!!! Love it. We spent a couple of hours chatting over lunch and listening to wonderful stories from Stan’s 26 year career as a 5th grade teacher. It was an absolutely wonderful lunch! We had planned to take him out for all his trouble to try and help us out, but he wouldn’t hear of it and insisted on providing us with some more trail magic! Of course he asked where he could drop us off and Next Step asked if we could go to downtown Erwin to the local movie theater. The recently renovated theater just reopened. Perfect timing! It’s an absolutely charming little downtown area and the perfect spot for a theater. Before leaving, Stan gave us mini pies and Reese’s Cups to get us thru our hike tomorrow. He’ll be back out doing Trail Magic this week, so be on the lookout!!! What a blessing! So then, I got my movie fix!!! Only the second movie I’ve seen since we started our hike! We saw “I Can Only Imagine”. Very touching true story about God transforming lives. And sitting thru a movie is VERY relaxing!  
Now time for resupply! We walked down to Food Lion and only had to get enough to last a couple of days. We’ll get to resupply at our next hostel on Tuesday night. We were fortunate enough to get our hostel owners to come pick us up. Now back to pack up and be ready to go in the morning. But not before one more treat. Charles, a nice gentleman we met at church this morning, offered to pick us up in the morning to take us to breakfast before we head back to the trail. He knows of a spot that has delicious biscuits and gravy with country ham. Next Step said, “You had me at breakfast!!” He already knew who we were because of some other 2017 thru hikers, Preacher and Stretch, who we know and who visited the same church during their SOBO hike last year. What a small world!  
Truly an amazing way to spend our Zero!

He was also part of the Springer Mountain sendoff party. As if we didn’t have anything else to think about today, he wanted to make sure we didn’t forget his birthday. So there you have it. I must say that Christopher has faithfully texted us AT facts and corny jokes since day one of our journey. To reciprocate, we sent him a steady dose of corny birthday jokes today. If you are reading, Christopher, here’s one more for you…
Q: What happens when no one comes to your birthday party?A: You can have your cake and eat it too. 
In the real world, Monday’s can sometimes be a grind. Evidently the same rings true in the long distance hiking world. Especially when Monday falls after a zero day.

The day started on a good note. Charles (aka Dude), who we met at church yesterday, picked us up at the Cantarroso Farm and treated us to breakfast. Waiting for us at the diner were two of his buddies, Brinson, and Allen (aka Big Al). In my best effort to help Dude maximize his opportunity to do good, I ordered eggs, country ham, biscuits with gravy, and fried potatoes. The food was delicious and the company was delightful! Thanks guys. 
Dude dropped us off at Uncle Johnny’s, where Which Way needed to tend to a little business. We are using Mophie case chargers to give our I-Phones some extra juice. For some reason, WWs stopped working about a week ago. She called Mophie customer support and, after a little trouble shooting, they agreed to send her a replacement case at no charge. It was delivered to Uncle Johnny’s and she went to pick it up and send the old one back. Thanks for the great customer support Mophie. 
It was well after 10:00 when we crossed the bridge over the Nolichucky River and resumed our hike. The trail followed the roaring river for about a mile, gradually rising above it. From there the path turned away from the Nolichucky, and began traversing a mountain stream. The roar of the river was replaced by the more soothing sound of the clear rushing water finding its way down the mountain. We crossed the stream several times, walking through Rhododendron tunnels as we meandered our way to greater heights. When we parted ways with the stream the footpath became more rugged and the ascent steepened. The trail bypassed Erwin to the east and we were starting to catch views of North Erwin through the trees. I was hoping to come to a good spot to get a picture. Then, in an instant, Erwin was covered by a cloud that soon swallowed us up too. With it came a light drizzle that persisted for the next several hours. Along the way we passed by Heartburn and Spirit Man. Then we passed by the rest of the Los Jalapeños crew—Sky Water, Cackles, Blade, Peanut, and Cin-a-bun. The only problem was, they were all headed in the opposite direction. Had I followed Which Way the wrong way? It turns out that they had all caught a shuttle to a point north on the trail and were slack packing back to Uncle Johnny’s. We must be doing something wrong. Deflated, but undeterred we continued our climb from 1,780’ (where we started our day) to 5,000’ (where we would tent). As the elevation increased, the fog thickened, obscuring any potential views. It became as if we were just hiking in a bubble that floated higher and higher. Creeping along in our fog-surrounded bubble made the hike feel mundane for the first time. This too shall pass. 
We paused at a pipe spring to water up and began a final push up Unaka Mountain. About a half mile short of the top we came to a tent site. A tree at the spot was decorated with Christmas ornaments. I believe it was some type of a memorial. Hikers were contributing to the decorations and signing a guestbook. We will check it out in the morning. But, with rain and wind mixing with the cold air, setting up the tent and getting in warm dry clothes was job one. Soon we were safe inside our tent, but the rain and wind persisted. Hungry from the steep climb, but not eager to venture out into the mess and risk bringing water back in our dry cocoon, we opted to cook dinner under the tent vestibule. After eating a much needed pasta dinner, we packed up our food bags and left them outside the tent. We waited for the rain to stop and then found a spot out of mice’s reach to hang them. In the meantime, we took a little nap. When we woke up it was dark and a light rain still fell against the tent. But, we had to go to the bathroom, so we begrudgingly left our warm place and ventured out into the elements to take care of business. Mundane Monday was finally over. Looking forward to Terrific Tuesday!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586346,"Woke up to an icy tent and frigid temperatures, our favorite!! NOT!!! But one of the reasons we started our thru hike so early was to avoid as many hot days as possible, so we’re not complaining. Ok, we’re barely complaining. We didn’t want to get out of the warm sleeping bag, but knew we were going to be in a hostel tonight. It was going to be about an 11.5 mile day, so we had a “gotta get after it” approach to the day. As soon as we started, we had about a .5 mile hike up Unaka Mountain. But the sun immediately popped out, so we were already feeling much better than we did on Mundane Monday. We had only been hiking for a few miles and my phone rang. Uh. Oh. Forgot to put it on Airplane Mode. But I was very thankful I forgot because it was our son, Patrick. Unfortunately, he was battling a little stomach bug, but any day I get to talk to my kiddos on the phone is TERRIFIC!!! We chatted with him a bit and then got back to our hike. It was very cool all day, but even with the wind, we were comfortable because of the warming sunshine. It was one of those days where you put on your buff and roll down your sleeves to hike down the mountains and then take off your buff and put up your sleeves as soon as your start uphill. But you never realize just how cool it is until you stop hiking for a few minutes. 
We got to the first shelter, Cherry Gap Shelter, about 4.5 miles in and while Next Step was getting water, I made our pb&j sandwiches that we would have for lunch a little later in the day. We always try to make each stop count and get as much done as we can so as to minimize our stops, especially when it’s so chilly. We decided to wait until the trail crossed the next road before stopping for lunch (JUST IN CASE there was some trail magic). So glad we made that call!!! Just as we pulled out our sandwiches, a white van pulled up that had Casper painted on it and under Casper it said “The AT friendly van.” Now that could only mean one thing…Trail Magic!! And it is Terrific Tuesday, so why not?!?!  He had cold sodas and a variety of Little Debbie cakes and pies. “That will go perfectly with our sandwiches, thank you!” Rob, the trail angel, was super nice and we enjoyed chatting with him as we ate. Apparently he drives his van all the way to Massachusetts and makes lots of stops along the way. Fortunately, I am sure we’ll be seeing more of Rob and Casper. We had about 5 miles to go before arriving at a side trail, then another .6 mile hike to the hostel. “It better be worth it!”

We had several climbs, but mostly downhills, so we made good time to the side trail. As we were hiking down, we passed several hikers on their way back up. They had heard they could get a cheeseburger at the hostel. However, if Connie, the owner, is not in, there are no cheeseburgers getting served. And much to their dismay, Connie had gone to town for resupply items. But fortunately for us, she would be back in a few hours and we would get our cheeseburgers!! They all also mentioned that “There are LOTS of rules!!” That’s ok, I like rules too. 
We showed up and Connie’s husband was letting us know the Standing Operating Procedures at the Greasy Creek Hostile. As long as I get my cheeseburger, I’ll be glad to follow all the rules!! We sorted thru our food bags to see what we needed for resupply. My phone rang again, and this time it was our daughter, Holly. We got to talk with her for about 30 minutes as well. At this point, I really don’t think this Tuesday can be any more terrific! But we’re heading out in about 20 minutes to pick up the cheeseburgers and chocolate milkshakes, so I’m thinking maybe it can!!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586463,"It was one of those indescribable days. From the diverse terrain and foliage, to the change in elevation and temperatures, to the challenges and rewards, to the magnificent views, it was one to remember. It started where yesterday left off, at the Greasy Creek Friendly (as Connie likes to call it) with real grits and turkey bacon. What a wonderful beginning to our Wednesday. Which Way and I agreed that the stay here was worth the .6 mile walk down the mountain. It is certainly not the Hilton, but the love that Connie has for hikers permeates through her eccentric shack located in the foothills of the Roan Highlands.  
It was 9:00 by the time we walked from the Friendly, up the rutty mountain road leading to the AT, where we commenced our stretching routine. Our first of several climbs led us to Little Rock Knob. During the hike up, the forest floor was coming to life with ramps and other vegetation, casting a green hew on the otherwise brown surface. With the old growth trees still without foliage, we often caught glimpses of the highlands that lay before us. Soon those views will be blocked by leaf-covered trees. Pausing only to get water from a spring, we made pretty good time up to Little Rock Knob, which offered an amazing vista to the north and west. Which Way went ahead as I lingered a few more seconds looking for the perfect shot of Unaka Mountain. The vista came at the top of our first climb, where the trail took a 90 degree turn. Left off the trail means left back on the trail, so I thought. Racing down the hill to catch Which Way, something didn’t seem quite right (like the AT hiker I just passed by going the opposite direction and the fact that I had not caught up with Which Way after a few minutes). Better stop and toggle Guthook to GPS mode. Sure enough, I had gone the wrong way. Do Which Way and I need to exchange our trail names?? Racing back to catch up, I passed by Heartburn, who was taking a break. “Did you see Which Way come by?” The reply came, “Yep, about 10 minutes ago.” I thought, “Good, at least one of us is headed in the right direction.” I quickly toggled my phone off airplane mode and sent her a text saying that I was coming and to keep moving. I also paused periodically to send out a single long blast from my whistle. With my tinnitus, the ringing in my ears would get louder with each blow of the whistle, making it difficult to listen for WWs return blast. When I finally caught up, she said that she heard all of my signals and answered back every time. She added that as she was blowing her last whistle, she turned and a hiker was standing right there. She was sure he “enjoyed” her blowing it right in his face. Lol What a Whistling Wednesday.

As we began our biggest ascent of the day, 2,200’ to Roan High Knob, we stopped to filter more water. It didn’t take long before I realized that I had left my “dirty” bag (for gathering the unfiltered water) hanging from a tree 5 miles back. I could work around it, but getting water would now be made more difficult until I could get a replacement bag. What a whacky Wednesday. 

As we climbed above 5,000 feet, we found ourselves hiking in and out of dense Spruce (or was it Hemlock) stands. It was also significantly cooler in the shaded areas as we gained altitude. We could see our breath as we exhaled and some spots of the trail were covered with ice. Yikes, flashbacks from the Smoky Mountains! Still, we made pretty good time to the top, where we came to the site where the luxurious Cloud Land Hotel once stood.  As WW hung back, I explored a bit further and came upon a hiker about half my age getting ready to get down and knock out some push-ups with his pack on. Evidently that is how he celebrates milestones along the trail. A Soldier for life, I yelled out for him to wait, and then got down and knocked out thirty with him.  Back with WW now, another AT moment happened. A hiker named Babaganoosh had retrieved a dirty bag hanging from a tree 10 miles back and was asking if anyone knew who it belonged to Thank you Babaganoosh!! What a Wednesday. 
After a very cold and rocky hike down the other side of Roan Mountain, we crossed a highway and there before us stood three magnificent balds—Round, Jane and Grassy Ridge. We happily hiked up and over Round Bald and Jane’s Bald, both offering warm sun and inspiring views.  We skirted Grassy Ridge Bald and came to the last spring we would see for a while. It was after 5PM now, so I stopped to fill two extra liters of water, thinking we would be stealth camping somewhere soon. It was a downhill hike from here. By the time I caught WW, she had already passed two tent sites.  I told her I was carrying four liters of water and my feet were tired, but I would go as far as she wanted. We passed by Stan Murray Shelter, where Spamtown Rick and a couple of other hikers were setting up camp. Never mind, WW was locked in, passing several other stealth sites.

Finally, at 7PM we came to Yellow Mountain Gap and then down the .2 mile side trail to Overmountain Shelter. (which is a really cool barn that has been converted into a shelter). We would get to camp at the last shelter in NC with Heartburn, Spirit Man, Finn, Happy Feet, Mel, and about a dozen others that we don’t even know...yet. 

Our actual mileage today was 18.2 counting the side Trails (18.5 for NS).

What a Wednesday!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586547,"It was dawn at Overmountain Shelter when I unzipped the door of my tent and pulled back the rain fly. Taken by the view I nudged Which Way, “Take a look, Sweetie.” In that moment, I was thankful that we made it to this point on the trail yesterday, pitched our tent at this spot, and had a remarkable view to the south this morning. When I finally emerged from our cozy mobile home, I breathed in the crisp morning air and looked around to see other hikers meeting the day. Finn & Happy Feet, Mel, Heartburn, and Spirit Man were tented behind us. I introduced myself to a couple tented next to us, Poe and Savage, and their dog, Spartacus.  I was thankful to share the dawning day with Tramily. 

When the sun finally made its yellow glow over Little Hump Mountain, it instantly brought warmth to the day. Soon afterward we were hiking out in short sleeves. The trail greeted us with an incline that 200 miles ago would have earned a name like “Jacob’s Ladder.” Now, it was just another climb among climbs. A few moments into the ascent I looked back to see the barn that we were just standing on level with. Now though, it was well below us. I was thankful for “trail legs”, that even after a strenuous hike that ended barely 12 hours ago, were responding nicely to the early morning challenge. 

A few moments later we emerged from the trees and could see clearly that the ascent had just begun. Little Hump Mountain lay bare of trees, allowing the observer to trace the path to the top, far above. But, there is something about a bald that creates a sense of euphoria that masks any physical discomfort typically associated with such a rise in elevation. I am thankful for the sense of overwhelming joy that easily supersedes labored breathing so often on this journey.

After stretching our warm muscles and meditating on the beauty that surrounded us, we worked our way off one side of Little Hump, following the trail into the trees as it arched its way into position to advance up “Big” Hump Mountain. As we meandered through the forest we came to a spring, where we would water up for the day. I was thankful to have my dirty bag back. Other hikers were flowing in to get water from the same spring. Since it was getting congested in the tight space, Which Way continued on as soon as her water bladder was filled with cool and fresh spring water. I wrapped up my business soon thereafter and hit the trail hard in an effort to catch her. It was just a few hundred meters down the trail before I emerged from the tree line, to a site that took my breath away. I stood at the gap between the two “Humps” in sheer amazement! Yet another beautiful bald mountain. Have I been transported to the Scottish Highlands? I traced the path meandering its way to the top, straining to see WW. There she was, just a tiny speck on the trail about 1/3 of the way to top of the mountain. The speck moved with steady determination and I took off to catch her, but she was motoring up the steep mountain, undoubtedly on an adrenaline high. She was at the top of the steep climb in 10 minutes. I was still a couple of minutes behind, but close enough that we could see one another and read the body language clearly—overwhelming joy. I took out my camera and snapped a picture of her looking down from a boulder in her victory pose. She took out her camera and captured me finishing the climb to join her. As I approached her, I was holding back tears, so thankful to be married to this strong woman. 

The stretch of trail from Carver’s Gap (yesterday) to Hump Mountain, has been my favorite so far. Really, it is hard to describe, as have been so many moments on this journey. I am so very thankful that my Sheesh (WW) and I are able to share the experience together.

We lingered on Hump Mountain for a while. Enjoying a good signal, I uploaded the previous day’s journal entry photos while WW called family to try her best to describe the moment. Impossible!

Now for the hard part, the 3,000’ descent to our destination. We followed the path (mostly a narrow rut) off the bald and into the forest. Soon we were hiking over rock falls on the side of the mountain. Nonetheless, the scenery was nice, with occasional cliffs, moss-covered boulders, and spring flowers. About halfway through the descent we came to a clearing with views down to some cabins and farms. It was the kind if setting that causes one to pause, point and say, “I’d like to have a house right there”. 
At the end of “Doll Fats” we came to a sign that said, “Leaving North Carolina.” Much of the AT since entering the Smokey Mountains had scooted along the NC/TN border. Often, a shelter would be in one State while the water source, located on the other side of the trail, would be in the other State. Of course, we visited towns and hostels in both States. But now, we were exiting North Carolina for good! It means we officially have two States down and only 12 to go. The trail and shelters in North Carolina are well maintained and I would be remiss if I did not say that that I am thankful for the National Park and Forests Services, the Carolina Mountain Club, and other volunteers who help keep the trail viable for the millions of lucky people who set foot on it each year. I am also thankful for the wonderful trail-friendly communities in NC and some really awesome trail angels who seemed to always appear in just the right place at just the right time.

Although we still had a couple of more miles of downhill hiking, the trail surface became much gentler as we hiked into lower elevations. I also noticed buds on some of the trees. In a few weeks we will undoubtedly be hiking in the green tunnel. I am thankful that we were able to hike a good portion of the trail in cooler (yes, sometimes frigid) temperatures and with forest views enabled by the winter trees. 

We crossed the busy US-19 just before 2PM. Our destination, the Mountain Harbor Hostel was about a 1/4 mile hike down the road. As we were crossing to the other side, I saw Crazy Brit and D2 exiting the trail from the opposite direction (SOBO). They were still slack packing and their buddy, Uncle D, was there to pick them up. Thinking quickly, I “Yogied” a ride from Uncle D down to the hostel. I am thankful for my Yogying skills.

The Mountain Harbor is a lovely Hostel and B&B. A stream runs through the property, with the hostel and camp store on one side and the B&B on the other. There is a permanent food truck sitting next to the camp store, which we took advantage of in no time. I would classify the Mountain Harbor as a 5-star hostel due to the setting, appearance, amenities, and hiker-friendly service. We had booked a semi-private King Room in the hostel. But, when we arrived, we upgraded to the Jefferson Room in the B&B and asked that they kindly hold the King room for Finn & Happy Feet. When they called to make reservations from Overmountain this morning, the hostel was full and they were going to have to tent. I am thankful that the Mountain Harbor staff accommodated our request. 

In closing, the B&B is very nice. So much to be thankful for. So, so much!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586684,"Yesterday started with a breakfast befitting the 5-star Mountain Harbor Hostel. AYCE egg casserole, sausage, ham, fried potatoes, hash brown casserole, blueberry pancakes, biscuits and gravy and egg croissants. We had heard that it was the best breakfast served on the AT. It lived up to its reputation! The down side to such an amazing feast is that it is very difficult to motivate yourself up the mountains after eating so much food. But, up we went! 
Next Step was feeling very sluggish today for more reasons than one. Unfortunately, we had woken up during the night in our 5 star room to what felt like sweltering heat! I had turned the thermostat down to about 64, but it must have not been working right. (Or maybe it’s due to the fact that for the last 48 days, we’ve been mostly sleeping outside in mid-20 to upper-30 degree temps). Whatever the case, you would have thought Next Step was experiencing a hot flash! He jumped out of bed, shedding blankets and opening windows faster than I’ve seen him move in the last 48 days. Then he remained wide awake and worked on the journal from 1-5 am. That, along with the AYCE breakfast, would affect his pace the entire day. But like I told him, “Some days you get to be the tug boat, and some days you just have to settle being the barge.” For the first few weeks, I felt like the barge with all of my knee issues, so I was more than happy to be the tug boat. I had lots of energy, because I knew that the more miles we got in today, the quicker we would get to our hostel  tomorrow. And the potential for REAL FOOD!! I’m sure you’ve noticed even thinking I MIGHT get to go to town causes me to have abnormal hiking energy!! Lol

The trail was overflowing with signs of Spring and was green with rhododendrons and a thickening undergrowth. The path soon passed by a beautiful country cemetery and then by a quaint little church - so serene! Then we hiked along a mountain river gently flowing over big rocks. Just the kind I would have loved to play in as a kid. If I hadn’t been trying to get in big miles, I would have suggested we stop for a minute to soak our feet. There is nothing better for “hiker feet” than a quick soak in a frigid mountain stream. Of course it’s so cold, you can only stand it for a few seconds at a time. But that’s really all it takes to cool down the burning callouses we’ve already built up. I’m quite sure that the next time I get to go in for a pedicure, they will take one look at my rough feet and charge me double!! But I’m hoping that Damascus will be just the place to find out!! And if I can be sipping on an ice cold fountain Coke Zero while enjoying my pedicure, I’m pretty sure that Next Step will have to pry my fingers from the chair to get me out of there. Ok, back to the hike. I got a bit distracted there in my daydream.
We saw that there was a side trail to Jones Falls that we would reach around lunch time. It was only .2 miles off the trail, so we thought we would go there and eat. But right before we got to the side trail, we got to do our Friday the 13th Happy Dance, because we reached another milestone- 400 miles!!! That last 100 went by much quicker than the previous 100 for sure!! We then saw the side trail and I’m so glad we decided to go to the falls. They had to be between 150-200 feet tall. You can see the pictures, but I’m sure they won’t do them justice. Absolutely breathtaking! Not far after resuming our hike, we came to another set, Mountaineer Falls. Not nearly as magnificent as Jones Falls, but still beautiful. Seriously, almost every day we come across so many sights that cause us to pause and just be thankful not only for His creation, but also for the fact that we’re so blessed to be making this journey and being able to experience it firsthand!

We hiked on and as the temps got higher, our energy levels got lower. We decided we would start looking for a place to tent around 5:00. We found the perfect spot, except one small problem, there was no water source near it. Not only did we not have water to cook our supper and next day’s breakfast, but we were almost out of drinking water. The next source was at a cascading stream about 1.5 miles ahead and there was a tent site about .6 miles after the stream. That would put us at about 16 miles for the day and only leave about 9 miles to get us to the Black Bear Resort tomorrow. We were both running on fumes by then, but we knew that our hike was almost over for the day, so we pressed on. We found the tent site and it was perfect. It had a homemade fire ring and everything! Only one problem, there was a dead tree right in the line of fire. Um. No thank you. We’ll have to find another spot. 
Next Step knew I wouldn’t sleep a wink with that hanging over my head (no pun intended). So even though he was beyond exhausted, he went on up the trail looking for a better spot. He circled back behind our spot, and, nestled right behind us in the rhododendrons grove, was the perfect stealth site!! Just one more reason I love that man! We quickly washed off, changed out of our sweat drenched clothes into something dry, and then got the tent up in a hurry. While I got my sleep pad blown up, Next Step made a path back up to the original site which would make the perfect cooking spot. While he got his sleeping gear ready, I started cooking our supper, Knorr mac n cheese with some pre-cooked chicken breast thrown in. Not too bad. However, after we finish this hike, I hope to NEVER eat another Knorr pasta dish or a bite of tuna as long as I’m blessed to live! Some things you have to do because you know it’s good for you (i.e. eat tuna because it’s packed with protein) but you don’t have to like it! 

We got everything cleaned up and Next Step got the bear bags hung right before dark. Perfect timing!

Hugs - Which Way

P.S. Almost every night Next Step falls asleep after only writing a couple of lines of the journal. But then he’ll always wake up around 2 or 3 am and finish it. This did not happen last night. He slept like a log, so I am frantically trying to do yesterday’s journal as we sit here eating our lunch.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586776,"Unlike Thursday night, when I stayed in a temperature controlled private room with a king bed, I slept like a rock last night. I reckon I’ve just become accustomed to cold nights in my well-ventilated Big Agnus Copper Spur-2 tent, Neo Therm air mattress, 19oz EE Revelation Quilt, and Ghost Whisperer Down Pillow (it’s really a jacket).  Even though the sun was up before I crawled out of the tent, our house and belongings were packed up and we were hiking by 8:15. 

It was only an eight mile hike to Dennis Cove Road (and access to a Cabin) and we enjoyed easy terrain and only moderate elevation changes. Although I still felt a little sluggish out of the gate, everything seemed to be back in good hiking order after our morning stretch. Which Way was also having problems finding her stride. That is, until she started to smell the barn. In this case the barn was “The Black Bear Resort”, located just .4 miles east on Dennis Cove Rd. There were a couple of rock outcroppings and a few other good views along the path. The trail weaved in and out of Rhododendron groves and crossed several streams along the way. It also passed through a couple of open fields, providing some diversity to the hike. One such field close to Dennis Cove Road played host to an old run down barn.

The parking area at Dennis Cove Rd. was full of cars. Apparently this is a popular destination for day hikers. Once we hit the road and realized that no one was going to offer us a lift, we started our .4 mile walk to the Black Bear Resort. It was an easy walk along the swift moving Laurel Fork. There were several nice houses and vacation cabins along the way. The Black Bear Resort soon came into view. It was a little bit past noon when we crossed the bridge onto the property. The first building we came to was a bunkhouse on one end and camp store on the other end. The Black Bear Resort is family owned and operated. Mary Lee and her daughter Stephanie were sitting on the front porch of the camp store when we walked up. Mary Lee greeted us and took us inside the store to register us for a cabin and give us an orientation of the area (bathhouse, laundry, etc.). We signed up for a shuttle to town at 5PM and followed a bridge path to our little cabin—the Mountain Mama (perfect for WW). After we downed a microwaveable Philly Cheesesteak sandwich we cleaned up and did our laundry.  With a little downtime, WW decided to lay down for a quick nap, while I slipped down to a quiet spot just below our cabin. About 30 minutes later I heard a thud coming from the direction of our cabin. The thud was followed by a cry, “Darrell!” I raced back up the cabin where I found WW laying on the ground just below the patio stairs. She was coming to join me and tripped over our shoes which were drying out on the steps. She landed on her backside and her momentum carried over until her face made contact with the ground, bloodying her upper and lower lips. I helped her up and took her back into the cabin where we cleaned up her scrapes. Mountain Mama hiked for 400 miles over some rough terrain with barely a fall, but the steps were evidently too tough to negotiate without her hiking poles. I am happy to report that, other than her scarped up lips, sore backside, and a bruised ego, she is doing fine now. 

The cute little cabin had two double beds with a twin bunk above each. I thought I understood Mary Lee to say there was one double and two twin beds when I made the reservation, so I told Heartburn he could have one of the twins and was welcome to invite another hiker to take the other twin bed. He and Mel arrived around 4:30. When I showed them the accommodations, Mel suggested that we let Finn and Happy Feet have the other double bed. They did not arrive until after the shuttle had departed for town, so we asked Stephanie to show them to the cabin. 

After returning from a quick Dollar General Store, McDonalds, and Subway run, we found Finn and Happy Feet already situated in the cabin. Unfortunately, Happy Feet was not feeling well. She was dehydrated and experiencing pain from a previous neck injury. Hopefully she will be doing better in the morning. 

WW and I sat on the porch telling hiker stories until well after dark.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586889,"The forecast called for thunderstorms and heavy rain, turning to snow in the evening. The next three shelters north of Dennis Cove Road are 2, 9, and 18 miles away. The middle shelter (at Watauga Lake) is closed due to aggressive bear activity. For the same reason, no tenting is allowed in the 9 mile area between Watauga Lake and the third shelter. We did not want to attempt the 18 miles to the third shelter in stormy weather, so we decided to hike from Black Bear Resort to Watauga Lake and catch a shuttle back to the safety of our cabin for the night. As a stretch goal, we could hike 5 miles further to Wilbur Dam Road (a total of 13 miles), setting us up nicely for Damascus. Mel and Heartburn hiked out with us at 7AM. Happy Feet was still not feeling well, so she and Finn remained at the cabin. It was about 7:30 by the time we walked the .4 mikes back to the trailhead and commenced our stretching routine. Spamtown Rick passed us by as we were stretching. He said he was going to try to make it the 18 miles to the third shelter. 

A short distance into the hike we crossed a foot bridge over Laurel fork, which was moving at a torrent in the steeper terrain. The path followed along the river for a bit. Then Laurel Fork turned away from the trail, plunging into a deep canyon. The AT followed a different path into the canyon as we walked down stone steps for about 1/2 mile or so. At the bottom of the canyon the trail led right up to the impressive Laurel Falls and then ran adjacent to the river, which was now crashing its way down the canyon. For a stretch we were walking on a cut in a cliff wall, as the river raged just below us.  It was awesome! 

We crossed Laurel Fork on a footbridge two more times before the trail exited the canyon, climbing 1,800 feet to the top. As we hiked up, the rain picked up in intensity and we picked up the pace. At the top we all stopped for a snack and filtered water. Spamtown Rick was leaving just as we arrived, but not before I told him of our plans to shuttle back to Black Bear Resort. WW and I took off as Heartburn and Mel continued to break. The plan was to meet at the lake and make a decision on whether or not to continue to Wilbur Dam Road.

Soon after we started hiking again, the rain picked up in intensity. It wasn’t long before we were all soaked to the bone. With about a mile to go I raced ahead of WW so that I could try to bring up the radar on my phone. About .4 miles from the lake there was a trail intersection and a sign with maps and area information. A dog house sized roof covered the sign. Standing under the tiny pavilion seeking refuge from the cold hard rain was Spamtown Rick. I joined him and pulled up the radar. We were on the leading edge of a lot of heavy rain (reds and yellows on the radar map). Rick was now interested in hearing more about our plans. WW, Heartburn and Mel soon arrived. Now there were five shivering bodies taking cover in this tiny space. I showed all of them the radar and it took about three seconds to make a collective decision that we were going no further than Watauga Lake. I got Bob, our shuttle driver and owner of Black Bear Resort on the phone and summoned him to pick us up at the Shook Recreation Area, where there was a real pavilion we could wait under. 

Bob arrived within a few minutes with Finn riding shotgun in his van. The rest of us piled into the back of the van and Bob drove us to Food City for resupply and something hot from the deli. The ever-accommodating Bob, mentioned that there was a grill that we could use at the “Big House” if we wanted to get some steaks. We walked out of Food City with NY Strips, T-bones, baking potatoes, salads, etc. We would feast tonight! There was just one thing Bob needed to do... clear it with Mary Lee, business partner and wife. Bob informed us that he was just the “shuttleologist” and Mary Lee and their daughter, Stephanie, take care of reservations, finances, etc. In other words, Bob just does as he is told and leaves the decision making to Mary Lee. When the van pulled up to the camp store/office, Mary Lee stepped out with a list of instructions for Bob. I think he was gone a little too long for her liking. Uh-oh, bad timing.  Undeterred, Bob asked Mary Lee if anyone was staying in the Big House (he already knew the answer) and if the occupants in the back of the van could use it to grill our steaks. I added a please from the back seat. She gave Bob THE LOOK and reluctantly agreed, adding that we needed to clean up after ourselves. We all (Bob included) sounded off with a “Yes Ma’am.” Bob wasted no time throwing the van in reverse as he continued to agree to do more chores that Mary Lee was barking at him as we were backing up. As we pulled away, I said, “You really took one for the team there Bob.” He responded, “You bet I did.” 
It was a short drive up the hill to the big house. The plan was to put all the food inside, get cleaned up and put on dry clothes at the shower house, do other hiker chores in our tiny cabin, then come back later to fix our steak dinner at the Big House. When we got inside, Bob was happily showing off the place, even firing up the wood-burning stove. A gas grill was located under cover on a huge deck out back. The Big House had four bedrooms with six beds, two bathrooms, a huge kitchen-dining area, a cozy den with a TV, and its very own washer and dryer. It wasn’t long before the question came up about renting the place for the night. Bob said that it was $195 a night, but we would have to clear it with Mary Lee. It did not take long for us to do the math and realize that for a few extra bucks each, we could be staying in the Big House tonight, with all of its extra comfort and convenience. I told Bob I would handle this one if it was okay with him. He quickly nodded, yes. Within 45 seconds I had sprinted back down the hill through the pouring rain and was standing before Mary Lee, shivering and dripping wet. Putting on my thick KenTexan accent I said, “Mary Lee, if it would work out for you we would like to rent the big house for the night...we can be out of our cabin in 15 minutes, freeing it up for other needy hikers.” Mary Lee, being both a smart business woman and a kind person, agreed. I said thanks and headed back out the door. As I raced back up the hill with the great news I saw Spirit Man coming in...”We will have to recruit him.” 

A few hours later, the eight of us were clean, dry, and chowing down on a delicious steak dinner. I volunteered to be the grill master and was thankful that the perfectly seasoned steaks turned out to everyone’s liking. One person said, “This is better than the breakfast at Mountain Harbor.” Finn added, “This is the best meal I have had since we started our hike.” 
After dinner, we finished a game of golf (cards) we started earlier. Then a few of us played rummy while the others watched a movie until well past hikers midnight. It was a great opportunity to draw closer to our Tramily. For a night, we all lived like Kings and Queens, in The Big House!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587020,"Did someone say it was mid-April? Because it feels more like the middle of winter out here. After raining all night, the precipitation had changed to a wintry mix by morning. For most of the day we hiked in either snow or sleet. The weather deteriorated throughout the day, with temperatures falling well below freezing and the winds were pelting snow and ice against our head and bodies. 

The day started cozy enough inside the Big House where we enjoyed a breakfast hash and packed our gear in a controlled climate. Our shuttleologist arrived at the camp store at 9AM. Finn, Happy Feet, Spirit Man, and Spamtown Rick all piled in the van with us and we headed for The Shook Branch Recreation. Area. Finn, Happy Feet and Spirit Man headed south on the A.T. back to The Black Bear Resort. They were all planning to stay another night at the Big House. Heartburn and Mel took a zero to let the rest of the group catch up. 

Spamtown Rick was headed north with us. A rain-snow squall greeted us as soon as we exited the van. About 200 yards of the trail around Lake Watauga was under enough water to make it impassable, so we took a detour along the road and then followed a blue blaze reconnecting us to the AT. The trail continued to circumnavigate the lake from above, eventually crossing over the Wilbur Dam. After crossing the dam the trail continued along the road up a steep incline. After re-entering the forest, we met the Los Jalapeños Gang headed southbound, slack packing back to The Black Bear Resort. The happy group has been sticking together for a while now. 

As we continued the long climb to 4,000+ feet, the temperature fell, the wind blew harder, and the sleet and snow picked up in intensity. Reaching the Vandeventer Shelter a little before 2PM, we stopped to cook up some Knorr Red Beans & Rice with Summer Sausage for lunch. Suspecting that the conditions would be miserable at our final destination, we decided to save our PBJ wraps for dinner, rather than trying to cook in the cold, wind and snow. While we prepared our meal, we had a nice chat with a thru hiker named Dynasty. He had started his hike on 24 Feb, the same day as us. Dynasty was in the small snowy shelter to stay for the night. We would hike another 6.5 miles through the driving sleet to Iron Mountain Shelter. 

When we arrived at our destination, I saw several tents already set up next to the shelter. There were several hikers gathered around a small fire and the heavy smoke was blowing directly into the shelter. Seeing an adequate tent spot about 20 meters before the shelter, we stopped and scratched out a place in the snow to set up. It was snowing harder and the wind chill made it nearly unbearable, so we worked as quickly as possible to set up the tent and get everything that would freeze overnight inside, including us. After warming up in our bags a little, we ate our pre-made, and now frozen, PBJ wraps. Better weather is expected tomorrow. We’ll definitely be looking forward to that!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587133,"I’ve said before that if you don’t like the weather on the Appalachian Trail, just keep hiking. That certainly held true today. We woke up this morning to a couple inches of fresh snow and frigid temperatures. Once enough hikers departed to make room in the shelter, we made our way there to cook up some oatmeal. It was 10:15 by the time we finished breakfast and packed up our tent. Just as we started hiking, the clouds gave way to sunshine. A 1/2 mile down the trail our fingers and toes began to warm. About an hour into the hike the frozen drinking tubes of our hydration system thawed enough to let water through.

The elevation today ranged from 4,100 to 3,400 feet and the ground was soft, making for easy walking. In fact, the first 8 miles of the trail were the easiest stretch we have had so far. Just what the doctor ordered! As we made our way over gentle hills and through some boggy areas walking on low foot bridges, the ice on the trees above melted away. We passed through a cluster of maple trees which still had snow clinging to their buds. With the help of the gusting wind, the snow high in the trees was cast aside, hurling slush bombs to the ground below. Which Way caught one on the edge of her cap, exploding between her glasses and the bridge of her nose. Fun! 

At the lower elevations the snow was completely melted. The trail crossed a country road and entered into a gorgeous pasture at Cross Mountain. The wide gravel covered path was actually marked handicap accessible. This made me think of something my brother-in-law, Jeff, asked me back in Robinsville. I guess he had a “Rails to Trails” image of the AT and asked ,”Is the trail like 3 feet wide?” Yes, Jeff, it is. At least for this 1/2 mile it is.

A little after 2PM we arrived at Double Springs Shelter, where we stopped to get water and eat lunch. Spamtown Rick showed up just as we were leaving.  The last 8 miles of the hike were a bit of a grind, as we hit a roller coaster of hills. Up 200 feet, down 150, up 100, down, 175... After a while it wore on us, especially after yesterday’s hike. Much of the last several miles, we hiked up and down spurs, exposed to 30-40MPH wind gusts, making it a chilly 50 degrees.

Exhausted from back to back long days, we arrived at Abingdon Gap Shelter shortly after 6PM, leaving us plenty of time to stretch, cook up a pasta dinner, and take care of hiker chores. To our surprise, there was no one in the shelter and only one person tented when we arrived. A few more tent campers showed up before dark. Where have all the hikers gone? Seriously, I have heard that the foul weather has created a lot of attrition this year. Perhaps someone reading this have more insight.

This is our last shelter in Tennessee! Tomorrow we will get up early and hike to Damascus, VA. This minute, I am content to just be thawed out. Actually, we are both cozy and warm.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587215,"In stark contrast to yesterday’s shivery start, we casually sat on a log this morning watching the sun rise as we ate our breakfast. We were up and hiking a little earlier than usual this morning. You probably know by now that only one thing gets Which Way moving that fast—Town Day! It was not just any town either. We were headed to Damascus; that is, Damascus Virginia!

Spamtown Rick was evidently more eager than us to get to town, as he hiked through the Abingdon Gap Shelter area as we were about to take off. He said he took off at 6:15 and had already hiked a couple of miles. Aussie, the hiker who was already tented outside the shelter when we arrived last night, was also off to an early start. Aussie is from Melbourne, Australia. 

It was just 10 easy miles to the iconic trail town and only 7 miles to the TN/VA line and WW was moving out. Man was that gal moving! Hiking along a ridge with a clear line of site through the still bare trees, we had good views of the green valley below and South Holston Lake. In no time, we reached the State line, where we took a few pics and shot our traditional corny video. The 94 miles of the AT running exclusively through Tennessee provided some of our best hiking yet. An additional 160 miles of the AT skirted the TN/NC border, including Clingman’s Dome, the highest point on the trail. But now we are in Virginia and we will be here for a while. A whopping 554 miles, about 1/4 of the total distance of the AT, runs through the state. “Virginia is for lovers” is the state motto, but for many AT hikers it is home to the “Virginia Blues.” It is where mental toughness becomes (and maybe a little stubbornness) just as important as the physical aspect of hiking the trail.

By noon we had we had reached the heart of Damascus. It is the second town since Springer Mountain that the trail actually runs through. Other hiking and biking trails also lead to Damascus. This includes the Virginia Creeper Trail, a 34 mile bike trail running from Abingdon to Damascus. It is considered to be one of the nicest biking trails in America. Damascus is also considered by many to be the most iconic trail town. It is home to Trail Days, a festival held each year in late May. Trail Days celebrates the Appalachian Trail and its current, former and aspiring hikers that converge there each year for a huge party. Music, an auction, a fun parade, a hikers' talent show, workshops and presentations, movies, hikes, lots of food, and other family-friendly events make this one of the most popular small-town events in Virginia and all along the Trail!

Our first stop in Damascus was the Lazy Fox Inn, the hidden gem where we will be lodging for the next two nights (yes, that means a ZERO tomorrow). The proprietor of Lazy Fox is a sweet 94 year old lady named Jinny. A former Traveling Accountant for General Electric, she has been operating the Lazy Fox for the past 26 years.

Moments after we arrived Dale & Joan Phillips walked through the door. I served with Dale in the 82nd Airborne Division 25 years ago (back in the day). Dale is a real Jumpmaster! With 99 jumps, he earned the title Master Parachutist. He was also one of the great NCOs that mentored this once young officer, who was full of vim and vigor. The ever patient Sargent Phillips delivered life lessons in a plain spoken way. He would say things like, “If you ain’t humping (the name for 20K ruck marches with full combat load) and you ain’t Jumpmastering (just jumping was not good enough), you ain’t leading in the 82nd.” Since I myself, speak KenTexan I heard him loud and clear, and I was a better officer for it. Thanks Dale!!! By the way, Dale also told some of the biggest fish tails I had ever heard. But I knew that nothing that big came from the state of Indiana. But today Dale and his sweetheart wife, Joan, had a new title—Trail Angels. He is still earning his wings after all these years.

Dale and Joan have been following our trail journal and drove all the way from Fayetteville, NC to hang out with us for a bit. And man did they show up with some goodies. Of course they had a Coke Zero for WW and a cold chocolate milk for me. They also brought us a whole bag of sweets and other hiker goodies including oatmeal cakes, honey buns, pop tarts, starbursts, trail mix, a giant bag of Snickers, sun dried tomatoes, hand lotion for WW, extra batteries!!! So thoughtful!

After a quick shower we drove down to Mojo’s Trailside Cafe & Coffee Shop for some good burgers. Then we stopped by Crazy Larry’s to drop off our dirty laundry and to the Post Office to pick up a few packages. Dale and some of his paratrooper buddies are planning an AT section hike next year, so when we returned to the Lazy Fox we spent some time talking gear and such. I even did an MSR Pocket Rocket and Platypus Gravityworks demo for him. I think he is sold on that and my EE Revelation Quilt. 

We drove to Abingdon for some delicious pizza at Bella’s and then then dessert at the Ice Cream Stop. We were back at the Lazy Fox by dark and sat around telling paratrooper stories from the past and trail stories from the present until well after hiker midnight.

Back in the day we would say, “It’s a great day to be a paratrooper!” Today it was a great day to be an AT Hiker!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587283,"Well, the day began with the most incredible breakfast we’ve had on the trail yet!!! We didn’t think anything could top our stay at the Mountain Harbor, but that’s because we’ve never been to the Lazy Fox Inn. Jinny, the 94 year old owner, told us yesterday that the only rules were 1) breakfast is served at 8AM and 2) you can come and go as you please. (Now THOSE are my kind of rules!!) I woke up to the smell of bacon frying around 6AM. That seemed kind of early since there were only six of us staying at the inn and breakfast wasn’t for two more hours. But that’s because I had NO IDEA what Jinny was whipping up downstairs. Her helper, Joe (who is a mere spring chicken at age 82) rang the breakfast bell at 8 on the nose. We turned the corner, and the ginormous table was absolutely full of dishes! Jinny and Joe had made fried eggs, scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, cheese grits, pineapple casserole, steamed apples, pancakes, hash browns, sausage, bacon, fresh fruit, and prunes!!! And did I mention there were only six of us?!?!?  Every bite was delectable!!!! We all ate until we were about to pop, but it was just too delicious to not at least try a taste of everything! We sat around and chatted a bit (mainly because none of us could move) and finally were able to head to Abingdon for some resupply. 
Next Step had asked Jinny if she knew of a massage therapist in Abingdon. Unfortunately, when she called the one she knew, the therapist just happened to be hiking the PCT!! Good for her! But the therapist said that the Martha Washington Inn and Spa has one that she recommended, and oh, by the way, they also did pedicures!!! Hellooo?!?! Please sign me up. It was almost like my daydream I had a couple of days ago was coming true!!! We made a quick trip to Kroger, where we also picked up 4 pounds of butter for Jinny (our pleasure, and I’m sure we’ll be benefitting from that at tomorrow’s breakfast, lol) and a few items to resupply. Then our trail angels who are also Next Step’s 82nd buddy, Dale and his amazing wife, Joan took us to the spa. They graciously agreed to just walk around the quaint little town while we got pampered. Cindy, my nail tech, knew EXACTLY what these poor hiker feet needed (and fortunately, unlike my daydream, she did NOT charge me double!!) It was the best $ we have spent since we started hiking, as far as I’m concerned. Next Step came out with puffy eyes and dried drool on his lip!! Not really, but he said he had literally fallen asleep and was still disoriented from his 60 minute massage. Angel, his therapist, said he was massage drunk! I think it is really a thing! Haha! 
Dale and Joan got us back to the Lazy Fox and we had to part ways so that they could make the five hour drive back to Fort Bragg. Their visit meant more to us than words could say! They truly were there just to make our lives feel perfect and we will never forget our time together!! Just as they were leaving, another of our trail angels, Charles (who we had met back at church in Erwin and had already treated us to a breakfast) and his lovely wife, Sheila, were heading over to the Lazy Fox to take us out for Mexican food. Our day was filled with kindness and beautiful souls! We so enjoyed chatting with them over dinner and getting to know them better. The trail has made us so aware of the absolute goodness of friends and strangers! After supper they dropped us back at the library in Damascus so we could get on the computer and take care of some retirement business. Next Step is already talking about finding some ice cream later. It’s a good thing we have to walk back to the Lazy Fox to work up an appetite! 

A few minutes after we got back to the Inn, Heartburn and Butter Knife (aka Mel) showed up to get checked in and get their showers before we head out for dessert. Next Step and I worked on packing up and repackaging our bounce box and med box to mail on up the trail. It’s already 8PM and we haven’t left yet. Not sure if my desire for ice cream is going to be stronger than my need for sleep. But I do know this has been a Zero day to remember - our trail angels made SURE of that!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587471,"The day started with another delicious breakfast compliments of Jinny and Joe. Today she added Peach Cobbler to the smorgasbord, just in case we didn’t feel like we were getting enough variety?!?! After breakfast we packed up our gear and then bid farewell to Ms. Jinny. As I gave her a goodbye hug I said,”All good things must come to an end.” She replied, “You will be back.” I think she is right on that point. 
Heartburn and Butter Knife would be staying at the Lazy Fox another night (or two). As for us, there was still some business to take care of before leaving Damascus. Our last stop was at Mojos, which is located on the north edge of town. It was there that we waited for an important phone call that never came. We found Spirit Man sitting out front sipping on coffee and basking in the warm sunshine. The Los Jalapeños Gang also dropped by. Although we are a day ahead of our band of hiking friends, we still get to see them often in town. Other times we pass them going south on the trail. Another young hiker named Beans was sitting on the patio. Yes, he was carrying a can of Bush’s Baked Beans in the side pocket of his pack. 

At 12:30 we decided we had better hit the trail if we were going to get any hiking done. Our original plan was to take two days to hike the 32 miles to Grayson Highlands State Park. Since we had to linger in town to take care of business, we decided to break that into three days. This would also give the rest of our Tramily a chance to catch up with us. 

The AT shares the path with the Creeper Trail for about a half mile. Beans was out in front of us a bit. He would be the only NOBO we would see all day.  The Creeper Trail continued along a stream as the AT turned north to make its first of two ascents of the day. The trail for the next three miles was about as unremarkable as we have been on. But, after we crossed US 58, we were surrounded by Rhododendron, Mountain Laurel, and Holly Bushes. For the next three miles the AT paralleled the Creeper Trail, as they both hugged the swift running Whitetop Laurel Creek. We came to a small footbridge crossing a cascading stream, rushing to meet the Creek below. From there the AT climbed up and away from the Creeper Trail, with its steady stream of bike riders. 

There was a respectable climb for the final three miles of the hike. In no hurry, we took it nice and easy on this perfect hiking day. The temperature was in the mid-50s, the skies were blue, and a slight breeze gently cut through the air. It doesn’t get any better than this. As we climbed, we could see a cute little community called Taylors Valley through the brown trees. 

It was just a little after 5PM when we arrived at Saunders Shelter. It was here that we stopped to set up camp. Two section hikers (another husband and wife team) occupied the neat little shelter and two weekend hikers tented in the wooded area behind the shelter. It was nice to roll in and not be completely exhausted. We pitched our tent in an open field just beyond the shelter, where we would benefit from the evening and morning sun. Easy does it.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587602,"Man did I sleep well last night. The temperature got down in the mid-30s, but I was comfy cozy under my quilt. I think Which Way slept well too. It was daylight before we started to stir in our tent and after 10:00 by the time we hit the trail. Part of the reason for the late start was because we were engaged in conversation with the other hikers overnighting at the same shelter. It was sunny and had already warmed into the 50’s by the time we departed. It was easy hiking early on, as we hiked along a ridge with views of mountains to the east and west. By the time we reached Stagnant Pond our muscles were warmed up and ready for a good stretch. 

A few miles into our hike and guess who we see coming SOBO down the trail—Heartburn, Butter Knife, Finn and Happy Feet. They were trying to get in a big chunk of miles slack packing so that they could catch up with us at Grayson Highlands SP tomorrow. Butter Knife told us that she picked up a new pack, tent, sleeping pad, and cook pot in Damascus yesterday. She was able to cut 10 pounds off of her base weight. Also, Happy Feet was able to see a doctor in Abingdon yesterday to find out why she has been feeling so sluggish lately. She received a diagnosis and was given some meds, so we are hoping she will be running on all cylinders soon. We all chatted in the middle of the trail for a few minutes before continuing in opposite directions. Butter Knife kindly took our trash before we parted ways. 

A little further along, the AT merged with the Virginia Creeper Trail, where we were greeted by dozens of oncoming bikers. The path surface for the next mile or so was comprised of crushed gravel. Sweet! The trail crossed a large trestle bridge and then the AT and Creeper Trail split again. Soon we were climbing Lost Mountain, crossing streams and passing through patches of Rhododendron along the way.  At the top of the mountain stood another nice shelter, where we stopped for lunch. The varying condition of the shelters is determined in large part by who is maintaining a certain section of the trail. The Mount Rogers Trail Club oversees this section of the trail. Great work, team!

After departing the shelter the trail began a slow descent down to 3,200 feet. At the bottom, we passed through a pasture, skirting around a lovely knoll. Then came the 2,000’ climb up Whitetop Mountain. It was a steady and fairly steep ascent to Buzzard Rock, a secondary summit of Whitetop Mountain. On the way up, we started seeing little clusters of tiny pale lavender flowers called Spring Beauties. It amazes me how such a delicate looking species can thrive under such harsh mountain conditions. As we climbed, the flowers became more plentiful, at some points completely speckling the hillside in all directions. It has been bugging me that I do not know the names of most of the flowers and trees we have been encountering along our journey. I have tried unsuccessfully to use an app to help sort out what we are seeing. A couple of days ago I reached out to a friend, Theresa, who has some experience with these things. I sent her several pictures and she gave me a good description of what I was looking at...thank you Theresa. I will be posting some of the pics of flowers (with names) when I get the opportunity. A big thanks to “Halfway” for helping me with the name of the flowers we saw today. She left me a note on the guest book that read, “The flower photo is a carpet of spring beauties.  The root is edible and the flowers are everywhere like you said.”

Buzzard Rock was worth the climb. It sits on an open grassy ridge with spectacular views in all directions. We hung out a few minutes soaking up the late afternoon rays and enjoying the awesome scenery.

It was after 5:30 now and time to start looking for a tent site. We ended up stealth camping towards the bottom of Whitetop Mountain, about a mile north of VA 600. By the time we finished our evening routine, it was dark outside. The weather should be perfect for a good night’s sleep.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587698,"What an eventful day! So glad that we decided to make this a low mileage day, as it was not the kind of stuff we wanted to rush through.  Elk Garden and VA Hwy 600 were barely a mile below where we camped. With a parking lot, trash cans, and a restroom, it was the perfect place to stop and stretch. Only one thing could distract us from our stretching routine—Trail Magic! A couple who had hiked the AT a few years ago were revisiting some of the highlights with their daughter. They were just about to do a day hike into the Grayson Highlands, but were taking a few minutes to hand out goodies. As luck would have it, we showed up just as they were about to shut the lid on their Subaru. Never mind that we just finished breakfast, “I’ll have a brownie and a Mountain Dew please!” Three other thru hikers who we saw yesterday evening camped towards the top of Whitetop Mountain were already partaking in the trail magic when we showed up. Blackbird and Crafty hiked the PCT last year and are now engaged to be married. They are hiking the AT this year with a friend named TNT. I would categorize the hip threesome as “ultralight” backpackers. All three were carrying packs weighing under 15 pounds. Anyway, they were a super friendly bunch of young adults. 

Across the highway we crossed through a gate and walked a short distance to a wonderful hilltop meadow. It was a perfect place to stop and do our Sunday worship. Looking out at an expanse of mountains stretching as far as we could see, there was so much to be thankful for. 

Before entering the field, there was a sign that read, “Welcome to the Jefferson National Forest.” This is the fourth National Forest we have hiked in—Cherokee, Nantahala, Pisgah, and now Jefferson. The next several miles were through the Lewis Wilderness Area of the Jefferson National Forest.  D2 and Crazy Brit (from Nature’s Inn and the Apiary in Erwin) passed us by (going north) and I commented that it was good to see them finally hiking in the right direction. D2 replied that people were staring to call them Tinkerbell 1 and Tinkerbell 2, so they figured it was time to do some real backpacking. They looked to me to be in great shape for their ages and we played leap frog with them the rest of the day. A little further along, I picked up a stray glove laying on the trail that turned out to belong to Crazy Brit. They were taking a break at the Thomas Knob Shelter when we caught up with the two of them. Crazy Brit was only wearing one glove and was happy to get its mate back. D2 welcomed us to the “Finders Club”, stating that Crazy Brit is constantly losing gear. As we walked off, D2 was ribbing his hiking buddy. Crazy Brit’s only defense was,” That’s the first time in three days...” 

Soon after the shelter we hiked into a very rugged section characterized by open brushy fields with large rock formations protruding from the surface. All of the rocks made for pretty tenuous hiking, but it was worth every step. 

In addition to some amazing views, this stretch of the trail is home to wild ponies. Some speculate that they are descendants of Assateague and Chincoteague ponies. Nonetheless, the equines were released by the U.S. Forest Service into the area surrounding Mount Rogers National Recreation Area and Grayson Highlands State Park in 1975. The ponies are used to keep the brush along the balds in check. The herd has thrived and multiplied in the scrubby terrain. I was told the herd numbers about 150 in total. It wasn’t long before we came into contact with the carefree equines. We intermingled with them as they were busy doing their job (eating). A chance to get up close to the “wild” ponies marked a milestone on our journey. A second milestone came in the form of reaching the 500 mile mark. Of course, we paused to celebrate and take a picture. Just below the 500 mile mark we came to a rock tunnel known as Fat Man’s Squeeze. From that point downhill to Massie Gap, the rocky trail traversed through more open brushy terrain, bringing us by more ponies. 
Once we came to Massie Gap it was another .6 miles off trail to a parking area, where Dennis waited for us in a white van that would carry us to the Grayson Highlands General Store and Inn. Crafty, Blackbird, and TNT were already waiting in the van. D2 and Crazy Brit piled in with us. When we arrived at the neat little country store, we made a beeline for the deli and grill, where we ordered cheeseburgers, fries (onion rings for WW), and milkshakes. That would tide us over until dinner in three hours. There are a few rooms above the store. Heartburn had already made reservations for one of the queen rooms. He graciously gave WW and me the bed. Since there no more rooms in the Inn, the plan was for Heartburn, Butter Knife, Finn and Happy Feet to sleep on the floor. Dinner was served at 5:30. On the menu was Chicken Parmesan, pasta, salad and fried bread dough. We ordered up a meal for Heartburn and Butter Knife, who rolled in around 6:30. Finn and Happy Feet made it in after dark. Happy Feet came in smiling. She really enjoyed her time with the ponies. The lights in our snug little room were out before 10 and we were all fast asleep after another exhausting, but rewarding day on the AT.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587872,"We all wanted to be ready to go as soon as breakfast was over, so everyone was up and at it around 7. We all went down and ordered breakfast, which hit the spot. Next Step feasted on French toast and I had an egg, bacon and cheese sandwich, with chocolate milk and a Coke. (No Coke Zero was available, and at this point, I need all the calories I can get). It took a bit longer than we had hoped for everyone to eat and resupply, but we were all shuttled back and walked up .6 miles from the parking lot by 9:30. Next Step, Heartburn, Butter Knife and I were hoping to hike the 18 miles to get a ride to the Troutdale Church Hostel. The forecast was calling for rain most of the day with gusting wind, and none of us wanted to have to set up camp in the rain while we are soaking wet. Finn and Happy Feet also started with us, but weren’t as keen on trying to get to Troutdale. Next Step and I took off up the trail. We both felt very refreshed from our previous low mileage day. 
We hadn’t gone far when it began to sleet. Are you kidding me?!?! Are we doing that again?!?! Fortunately, it only lasted a few minutes as it turned into a light rain. We only had to hike about a mile before we reached the first shelter and popped in for our morning stretch. Just as we were getting started, Butter Knife and Heartburn walked up. They were happy just to watch, instead of joining in on our mountain yoga. We got out a quick snack and were about to leave as Finn and Happy Feet pulled in. That was the last time we saw them for the rest of the day. We hiked on and soon came to an open rugged meadow, just like we had seen yesterday when we saw the ponies. The wind was gusting so hard that I was literally stumbling down the trail. For some reason this was cracking me up. If I hadn’t had my hiking poles. I really think I would have toppled over or lifted off! But I can assure you that later on when the rain was coming down harder and the wind was gusting, I no longer found anything funny about it. Nope, not even a chuckle! Next Step posted a short video on Instagram that captured one of our windy moments. Butter Knife commented that the terrain was like she imagined the savannah in Africa. She said that she expected a giraffe to go strolling by at any moment. A giraffe would have been awesome, but instead, as we headed over the hill there was something very scary...longhorn cattle headed our way!!! No thank you, I am terrified of cows!!!! This brought back some fond and some “not so fond” memories from my childhood. My Papaw had a farm and most Saturdays we would go to the farm so that my Dad could help with the farming chores. The fond memories were from hours spent playing in the creek or having scavenger hunts. But my favorite part was the ride home when we got to stop at the country store and load up on snacks and Yoo Hoos  ( I might be 51, but I still love an ice cold Yoo Hoo!!). Now, for the “not so fond” memories. My least favorite job was having to help when the cows got out. My mom, sister and I would stand near the gate and when my dad rounded up the cows, our job was to make sure the cows didn’t slip by and that they actually went through the gate. Daddy said, “Now if they start coming toward you and try to get by, just wave your arms and yell.” Hello?!?! That would not be a problem!!! As soon as those cows even glanced my way, my arms would flail around like I was trying to fly and I would bellow out so loudly I probably scared the poor cows half to death! But I can assure you, they didn’t run past me!! Fortunately, the long horn cows and bulls we saw today were not very interested in us at all. I was very thankful because I realized that I was the only one wearing red. Perfect! Now I’ve never heard of an AT hiker being trampled by a longhorn cow or a bull, but I did not want me to be the reason they started a new statistic!! So just to be on the safe side, I got through the gate as quickly as possible. 

Soon after, it started raining a bit harder and we were happy to be out of the open meadow and back in the woods. We hiked about 6 more miles and then made it to the next shelter where we stopped for lunch. It was a treat! Before we left the store this morning, we had them make us some amazing sandwiches from the deli. Spirit Man strolled in as we started eating, which was a nice surprise. A few other flip flop hikers also joined us. In AT terminology a Flip Flop is used to describe a hike that is not done in the more traditional continuous NOBO or SOBO manner. Using the three hikers we met today as an example, two of the hikers started in Duncannon, PA, while the third hiker started in Harpers Ferry, WV. All three hikers are continuing south to Springer Mountain, GA and will then “flip flop” back to the start point and hike north to Katahdin. We tried to make it a quick stop so we could get to our destination before dark. Heartburn, Butter Knife, Next Step and I headed out and started one of our two long descents for the day. The four of us hiked together for the rest of the day. It was absolutely wonderful as we chatted while we hiked! It also made the miles go by quicker than normal, which was a good thing because this would turn out to be our longest hiking day yet. Heartburn and Butter Knife were waiting under a map awning when Next Step and I finished up the hike. By then, we were all thoroughly soaked! There was NOTHING dry on any of us and it was getting colder by the minute. The number one hiking rule when you’re wet and cold is to keep moving. However, the hostel was almost three miles from the intersection (VA 16 and 650) where our hike ended for the day and we were going to have to try to get a ride. Unfortunately, this was not a well-traveled highway and all the vehicles that passed us were not very interested in picking up 4 drenched hikers. Several would slow down, but when they saw how wet we were, they would literally punch the gas!! Seriously?!?!  Butter Knife made the command decision for us to at least start walking in the direction of Troutdale and just hope that someone would have pity on us. I agreed and quickly joined her. The last thing I wanted to do was keep standing there freezing half to death! Several cars and trucks zoomed right past us. Then up puttered an angel!!! A guy pulled over and I opened the door and asked as pitifully as possible if he could please take us to Troutdale Church Hostel??? Sure, packs in the trunk and just throw everything that’s in the seat, in the floor. I’m pretty sure he had been eating in his vehicle for at least the last 15 years and had yet to stop by a trash can. I just swiped all the food boxes, half eaten oatmeal cakes, baggies full of mashed bananas, and many other unidentifiable objects onto the floor. Every warning light on the dashboard was flashing, but we managed to make it to the hostel without breaking down. I couldn’t help but think to never judge a book by its cover. All these nice vehicles had passed us by, and this dude didn’t hesitate to not only give us a ride, but also give each of us a Mt. Dew when he dropped us off! And we all felt complete gratitude for his generosity!!! We made our way to the hostel which consisted of a small cabin with two bunk beds, a microwave, and most importantly, A HEATER!!! We were greeted by our nightly neighbors, Crazy Brit and D2. We all quickly got off our cold soaking wet clothes and felt immediate relief! Soon we would also have our bellies full of hot food and our earlier misery was becoming a faint memory. Okay, maybe that’s overstating it! Lol But we were all truly thankful to be warm and dry. Now to get a good night’s sleep and do it all again tomorrow, since the forecast is calling for more rain. At least tomorrow, we already have a ride set up back to the trail, we only have 13 miles to hike and we’re going to TOWN!!!! My favorite!!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588049,"The Marion Transit Bus was filled up with hikers when it departed the Walmart parking lot at 8:30. Hopping on the shuttle at the last second was Tangerine, a hiker we had not seen since Georgia. She was one of several hikers we would reunite with today. When the bus arrived at the Mount Rogers Recreation Area HQs, a dozen or so other hikers who had spent the night in the Partnership Shelter were waiting to board the bus for their own Marion excursion. 

By 9:00 we were back on the trail and hiking our way to the top of Glade Mountain in the mist and fog. The soft trail steadily ascended for a couple of miles before entering a series of downs and ups, eventually reaching the high point of today’s hike. A rock outcropping at the top apparently offered a view of Walker Mountain to the east. Not today. 

The terrain and surroundings were much different during the hike down Glade Mountain. This side of the mountain had large rock formations on the surface. There were also several stream crossings on the way down. We stopped to water up and eat lunch at the Chatfield Shelter. While I was getting water, Which Way was fending off a few hikers who were drooling over the sub sandwiches she pulled from the food bag. Since we were only carrying one day’s worth of food, we decided to pick up the large sandwiches from Ingle’s the night before. Good move! As we were wrapping up lunch, up walked another blast from the past—Twinkle, Helix (and his dog Odin), Future and Tang. This is another group of hikers we have not seen since Georgia. Like us, Future started from Springer Mtn. on 24 Feb. He had the unfortunate experience of helping to carry down the body of the man who died that day.

From the shelter we walked through a tunnel of Rhododendrons as we continued to make several more water crossings. The streams were swollen from the rain over the past few days, making it very difficult to cross without getting our feet wet. This would eventually cause problems for WW, as some old blisters re-emerged and some new ones formed.

The final stretch of the hike took us through some low (and wet) farmland. Heartburn was correct in commenting that this was as much a part of Appalachia as the mountains. The highlight of today’s hike was a short excursion to an Old Settlers Farm House and one-room school. The farmhouse, with its nine out buildings, sought to capture how the early settlers to SW Virginia lived. The preserved buildings, dating back to the late 1800s, sat on a beautiful 67 acre plot of land. A little further down the trail we came to the Lindamood School, which operated from 1894-1937. The small building used for teaching grades 1-7 offered a prime example of how a self-sufficient culture created its own school, years before the state claimed responsibility. A neat twist, there was Trail Magic located inside the school. It came in the form of cold drinks, snacks, and various resupply items. We all sat at the old-time desks in the schoolhouse enjoying our snacks.

After a quick tour of the museum, we finished our hike, walking through muddy, swampy lowland. The trail brought us to the edge of Atkins and the Relax Inn, where a resupply box awaited. A quick shout out to WW’s parents, Tom and Billie, for sending us our resupply boxes. They are always on time, on target, and sent with lots of love in the box!

It was a neat day on the AT. However, we are a little concerned about WW’s toes, as we have some bigger mile days planned in front of us. Please pray that we can keep her feet dry and healing.

",VA 683 - Atkins,"Apr 25, Wed",11.40
Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588142,"Today started the same as yesterday ended, at The Barn Restaurant. After an anything but relaxing stay at the Relax Inn, Heartburn, Butter Knife, Which Way and I were there at The Barn when the doors opened at 7AM. The plan was to eat a quick breakfast and hit the trail early, in hopes of hiking at least 16 miles. This would set us up nicely for a drive-by resupply in Bland on Saturday. Also, rain was forecast to move in later in the day and we wanted to get in as many fair weather miles as possible. 

Although the sun was shining, it was a chilly start to the day. The trail followed VA 683 for about 1/4 mile, passing under I-81. Then the white blazes led us off the road onto a soggy path that followed a stream through some lowland. Soon enough we were climbing out of the lowland and into an open pasture, where we were now dodging cow patties. Which Way and I found a safe zone (patty free) to do our stretches as Butter Knife, ever amused by our routine, took pictures. Nothing to see here, keep moving. Move we did, exiting the pasture over a steep stiles (a-frame ladder/steps built over a fence) and into the woods. We passed several campsites as we began the climb up Gullion Mountain. Oddly, one of the sites had a privy. You don’t see many privies that are not in close proximity to a shelter.

Like most days, the terrain and vegetation were very diverse—open fields, wooded mountains, hardwoods, Rhododendrons, etc.  Oh, big news, we passed the 547.725 mile mark. That is 1/4 of the 2,190.9 mile length of the Appalachian Trail. We are officially a quarter way there! There is a hostel along our path today called “The Quarter Way Inn.” Before we hit the mark, it had not occurred to me where it got its name. We had heard great things about the house turned hostel, but it would not work into our mileage plan to stay there...So we thought. 

Our second big ascent was up Walker Mountain. At the top we found a spot to break for lunch and take off our still wet shoes. We checked our progress on Guthook’s App as we ate and noticed that it was having a difficult time pinpointing our location. Plus, the elevation profile showed a distinct leveling off at the crest of the mountain. Instead we had just skirted the top and the trail never really flattened. Seeing white blazes around us, we figured it was just a re-route that the app had not yet updated.

After following the blazes down the other side of the mountain, we crossed VA 610 and began hiking through another hilly pasture. Although the trail here was not well worn, stakes in the ground with white blazes painted on top were positioned within line of sight, marking the way. The trail cut diagonally across the undulating terrain and the markings showed the way until we were about 3/4’s of the way to the wood-line. I could see Butter Knife, who was out front by a couple of hundred meters, pause at one of the stakes and then followed a well-worn trail down the hill. I thought, “That’s odd, why would the trail come all this way up the side of this pasture just to go down and cross the same road?” By the time I got to the marker where I saw Butter Knife pause, she was at the bottom, getting ready to cross over a stile and back onto VA 610. She was also following yellow blazes. I yelled out to her to wait, adding “I think the trail continues up and into the woods.” The problem was, that the trail going up was faint and I could not actually see a white blaze from where I stood. Butter Knife yelled back that Guthook (GPS locator) showed that she was on the trail. I pulled out my phone, opened Guthook, switched to map view, and toggled on the GPS. Sure enough, the arrow pointed in the direction she was headed, never mind that it appeared to be going south. 

By now Heartburn had caught up. We could see that the fresh yellow blazes were painted over the white blazes and rationalized that someone was playing tricks on us hikers. Perhaps it was even a disgruntled landowner who did not like that the trail was passing through his domain. So we all followed Butter Knife down the hill, across the road, through the field on the other side, and back into the woods. We hesitantly followed the well-worn yellow blaze for about a mile. Periodically we would receive a clue indicating that we were on the right track (e.g. a white blaze that had not been painted over or an “Appalachian Trail” sign coming from the opposite direction). Plus, Guthhook had our location on the trail. Still, something felt very wrong as we were now starting to climb Walker Mountain again. Which Way was on up ahead and called out that she was not seeing any other boot tracks in the soft mud that she was walking on. I got the idea to call Tina at The Quarter Way Inn, as her place was just 3/10 of a mile from VA 610. Surely she could tell us what was going on with the yellow blazes. Just one problem, bad reception. I could hear Tina fine, but she could not hear me. She said, “Sorry, I can’t hear you, but if you are looking for a room we have plenty of beds still open in the bunk room.” A minute later Heartburn called her from his phone. Although the reception was still bad, she was able to hear that we were having problems and said that she would drive down VA 610 and point us in the right direction. By now we were all together and collectively decided that we should turn back and hike the mile back to VA 610.  By then, we also decided we were staying at The Quarter Way Inn tonight, as the rain was coming soon and we were mentally exhausted. After hitting the road and walking half the distance to the hostel, Tina drove up in her van, with homemade cookies. She told us that they had just done a trail reroute three days ago. That explained the unworn path, fresh yellow blazes, and Guthook error. It didn’t matter now, we were staying at the Quarter Way Inn and would worry about the next 3/4’s tomorrow. 

In the end, I think it was all meant to be. Tina is a sweetheart and her place is awesome. Plus, we will now have much more manageable miles going into Pearisburg. The trail still provides.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588208,"After a good night’s sleep and an awesome breakfast at the Quarter Way Inn, we were ready to get back on the trail again. As we were departing Tina took a picture of our group in front of a huge sycamore tree in her front yard. She also told me that she reached out to the local trail club that was responsible for the Walker Mountain to VA 610 re-route, letting them know that hikers were confused by the signage at the north end of the new route. Tina also said that she was reaching out to Guthook to advise them to update the App with the new trail coordinates. Another hiker told us that he actually followed the yellow blaze all the way back to the top of Walker Mt, making a giant loop. Ouch!

Ready to put the past behind us, the four of us wasted no time walking .3 miles to where the AT intersected with VA 610 and then retraced our steps up the hilly pasture. This time we opted to continue up the hill on the faint path in search of the next white blaze. It appeared just over the rise, leading us back into the woods. 

A short distance later the trail merged with a country road that would take us over a bridge crossing the Holston River. The trail followed a narrow corridor between the river and private farmland. At times it felt as though we were running an obstacle course as we had to negotiate several steep stiles over tall fences. After parting ways with the river, we found ourselves on a muddy path passing through a live pasture. A dozen or so cows stared down at us as if they had never seen hikers before. The cattle were not the only species enjoying the lush grass in the pasture. Three deer were startled by our arrival and high tailed it into the woods above. No time to get a picture. Nor could I get the blue bird perched on a white blazed post to hold its pose long enough to frame a shot. Needless to say,  spring is alive in the mountain lowlands of southern Virginia. Wild dogwood, apple, and cherry trees were already shedding their blooms. Flowers blooming in all shapes and colors also lined the way. 
After a short stint through another wooded section, the trail came close to another road with trailhead parking. Backed into the small parking area was a white van. You guessed it, more trail magic. This time it was compliments of Ramblin Rose. She was supporting her husband, Turtle, in his thru hike. Turtle would show up at the same shelter as us later in the evening. 

After the nice morning stroll, it was time to get busy. The hike over Brushy Mountain and Lynn Camp Mountain were just a prelude to what would lie ahead. But before taking on the final ascent of the day, we crossed over Lick Creek and found a good spot to stop for lunch. Soon, Butter Knife & Heartburn, two German hikers and a young couple named Huck & Ray would join us. We all started the day at the Quarter Way Inn. 

Which Way and I were the first to begin the final five miles of the hike, up 2,100 feet to the top of Chestnut Knob. The steepest part of the climb came in the first 1.5 miles. With nothing to see but tall dark trees, we put our heads down and got after it. After the incline steadied a bit, we paused for a Cliff Bar that would fuel us to the top. Most of the final three miles were up a brushy mountainside. As we climbed higher the views on all sides and behind us grew grander. The best views were at the top, where we camped for the night. High winds were forecasted for tonight, so we opted to stay inside the fully enclosed Chestnut Knob Shelter. The other hikers were not far behind us. 

After some stretching, dinner and a game of cards (at least for Which Way, Butter Knife, and Ray), we stepped outside in time to catch an awesome sunset. It feels so good to be back on track.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588347,"Remarkably, the sunrise from Chestnut Knob was more majestic than the sunset (must see photo). It was undoubtedly the best we have experienced thus far on our journey. The day was already perfect before we had even taken a step. Nonetheless, there was some walking still to be done. 
But first, breakfast. Yesterday afternoon I made a call to the Burke’s Garden General Store to find out if it was feasible to get there from the trail for a hot meal and some re-supply.  On Guthook’s app there was an icon of the store below VA 623, which the AT would cross in about six miles. Other than a phone number, there was very little information (not even any user comments) and the little country store looked to be about five or six miles off trail from the road crossing. Oh well, it wouldn’t hurt to call. A very nice lady named Elizabeth answered the phone and after introductions, I asked what she could offer in the way of a hot breakfast. She said that the General Store normally didn’t open until 10:00, but they would be happy to cook something up a little earlier for us. This was starting to sound promising, so I inquired about shuttle options from the trail. She said that her husband, Joseph would be happy to pick us up at Walker Gap at 7:30ish. Wait, a quick look at the guidebook revealed that the trail crosses a dirt road at Walker Gap, only 1.5 miles below Chestnut Knob. “Just one more question ma’am, how much would the shuttle be?” She replied in her sweet accent, “Oh, we won’t charge anything if he brings the horse and buggy.” I replied, “Excuse me, did you say horse and buggy!?” She confirmed that it was in fact a horse and buggy that would pick us up and that it would hold six passengers. Without hesitation I told her that there would be six hungry hikers at Walker Gap at 7:30 sharp. I finished by telling Elizabeth that she had “made our night”. She misunderstood my KenTexan dialect, thinking that I was asking if she was a Mennonite. Her soft reply came, “No, we’re Amish.” We broke the news to Heartburn and Butter Knife when they arrived last night and they were all in. We had met a super sweet young couple the night before at the Quarterway Inn, Huck and Ray, and invited them to join us as well.  

I called the store as we were departing Chestnut Knob Shelter, to reconfirm everything. Joseph answered and said he was going to get the horse ready. We all got down the mountain in record time and waited for our ride to show. After what seemed like a long wait, we finally could hear the clippity-clop of the horseshoes striking the gravel road from below. By the time he reached the top and made a right turn in the gap, Bob (the horse) had already worked up a good lather. Bob wasn’t exactly pulling a buggy. Instead it was a tiny flatbed wagon sitting on iron wheels. After making introductions with Joe, we all somehow managed to pile on with our packs and started down the steep and rutty gravel road. Bob, a specimen of a workhorse, used all of his strength to keep from running down the steep winding hill with all of the weight that was pushing him forward. Like a hiker looking for a soft spot coming down a rocky hill, he spent most of his time in the ditch, which meant that the passengers on the right were fighting off stray branches as they simultaneously held on for dear life. In about a half mile we reached a paved road and Joe let Bob pick up to a gallop. We were now riding through the beautiful valley that we had been viewing from above early this morning. We passed by some immaculate old homes and lush farmland on the 5.5 mile ride. Joe was a very humble and friendly man, and an excellent tour guide. He pointed out things as we passed by, like the building that used to serve as a one-room schoolhouse and the “tallest willow tree” in the state of Virginia. I learned along the way that they were a community of 11 Amish families living in the valley referred to as “God’s Thumbprint.” 

Soon after we hit the road and the mud came off the tires, we noticed that the front left iron wheel was flat on one side. At one point in the ride the whole rim fell off. Which Way said “Um. I think we just lost something back there.” When Huck jumped off to fetch it Joe instructed him just to throw it in the ditch and he would pick it up later. It gave me an opportunity to get off and get a picture of our ride. I took a quick look at what was left of the wheel and informed Joe that it was coming apart. He said it would be okay. We trusted him. 

The General Store we were limping our way to had just opened last year and we were the first hikers to stumble on this amazing experience. Joe was looking to drum up more hiker business and asked me for some ideas. I gave him some tips on hiker resupply and suggested that he be more descriptive on the Guthook’s page and get added to AWOLs guide. Of course, the hiker grapevine works well, so I made a comment on Guthook’s page and texted back to some other hikers. This place has so much potential to become part of the amazing AT lore! 

Peace & Blessings- Next Step (WW has it from here) 

When we walked in the General Store, the smell of bacon directed us to the back where we would find two of Joe’s oldest daughters finishing up the most amazing country breakfast you can imagine. They already had homemade granola with milk on the table and freshly made bread with jam and berries. Also on the table were homemade pastries filled with cream cheese. YUM!!! The girls looked so happy just to see how happy we were. What a lesson for all of us!! They had made the fluffiest pancakes I’ve honestly ever seen in my life, eggs with sausage and cheese and thick cut bacon cooked perfectly crisp. They definitely knew what hikers needed! We all filled our plates and dug in. This was beyond anything we could ever have imagined! And if that wasn’t enough, as we were finishing, the girls were fixing up homemade glazed doughnuts!! Yes, we’ll take four of those to go! We sat around telling stories and you could tell the girls were very entertained by our conversation. 
What a morning! But we had to get back to the trail, so we ordered deli sandwiches to take for our supper and went out to catch our ride back to the trail. While we were eating, Joe had switched out the flatbed wagon for the Cadillac cart!! This wagon not only had four working wheels but it had two 3 person van seats attached. We loaded in and sat back and just enjoyed the scenery on the way back. This time Joe dropped us at the end of the paved road and didn’t make poor Bob make the trek back up the .5 mile steep rutty road. But we were glad to walk back up after all they had done for us! Several hikers gave Joe a generous tip for the “shuttle” and we had to make him take it. He said, “I don’t do this for the money.” And we all knew that he sincerely meant it. Just a beautiful family!! We didn’t get started on the rest of our hike until about noon. None of us complained about the late start after the amazing memory that had unfolded. We would never have thought that’s how our morning was going to be spent, when we started our hike yesterday. There’s really nothing I can say about our hike today that would compare to the morning’s experience. We ended up hiking about 11 more miles including a quick stop at the Jenkins Gap Shelter around 5:30 to eat the incredible deli sandwiches and donuts. Heartburn, Butter Knife, Next Step and I decided to hike on up to the top of the next mountain to get us a bit closer to our next exciting stop - Woods Hole Hostel (where we hear they have homemade bread and Amish cheeses). We won’t get there until Tuesday, but our plan is to hike as far as we can the next couple of days so that we’ll only have a short hike into the hostel on Tuesday and can take full advantage of all they have to offer!! 

We all stealth camped on the side of the mountain which blocked the stiff wind and would make for a wonderful end to a glorious day! Don’t get me wrong, the hiking has been BEYOND INCREDIBLE, but just as we had anticipated (and even more!!!) this journey is about so much more than the hike...

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588424,"If you were wondering how today could ever follow yesterday, it couldn’t. Except on the calendar, of course.  Nonetheless, any day on the AT is a great day. Each comes with its own challenges and rewards. Such is life.

It was a late departure at the Brimberry camp. I fell asleep early last night and slept through the night. That was a good thing, except it meant I didn’t get started on the journal until after daylight. I hated it, because there were so many details omitted from the over-the-top experience surrounding our rendezvous to the Burke’s Garden Store. Anyway, several hikers coming up from Jenkins Shelter passed by our little stealth site before we even stepped out of the tent. Some commented on what a nice spot it was. They were right. First, it was on high ground, well above the damp bottom where the shelter sat. Next, it was just below the crest of the mountain on the leeward side. Although we could hear the wind hallowing as it raced up the other side of the mountain and over our heads, barely a breeze blew on our tent. Finally, we were positioned in a spot that would catch the morning sun, which is always a plus when it is cold.

Anyway, by the time we got out of our tent, Butter Knife and Heartburn were long gone. As we were packing up, Huck and Ray, who tented at the shelter a couple of miles back also passed by. Everyone we saw was headed for the Brushy Mountain Outpost, a General Store adjacent to the AT on the outskirts of Bland. Word was that they had a grill, ice cream, and re-supply. Plus, they were open at 10AM on Sunday. Although it was nearly 9:00 before we walked away from camp and the store was over 10 miles away, the terrain was good, allowing us to cover a lot of ground quickly. We walked along a ridge for the first couple of miles before descending to Laurel Creek. There was a good signal at the top, so I paused before heading down to upload yesterday’s journal and photos. By the time I arrived at the sturdy footbridge and crossed the creek Which Way had already finished her morning stretches. I would just have to get mine in later. 

Arriving at the small General Store, a little before 12:30, Heartburn, Butter Knife, Huck and Ray had saved us a seat. The store/grill was being operated by a husband-wife team. Overwhelmed by the influx of hungry hikers, orders were backed up a bit. The husband ran the register while the wife (who didn’t seem too amused by the situation) prepared the food. Never mind though, she cooked up the best burger (other than the ones we made in Hot Springs) and chili dogs we have had so far on the trail. We also had a big order of fries and Which Way had a peach shake. We grabbed a few food items off the shelf and ordered BLTs to go. The six of us that sat together would all depart around 2PM. As we were finishing up, the Los Jalapeños Gang arrived, as jovial as ever.

The trail followed VA 612 for about a mile, crossing over US 52 and I-77. The stretch was windy, cold, and noisy and we were happy to be back in the woods. The terrain in the afternoon was similar to what we had this morning, so we were able to cover the 11 miles to Jenny Knob Shelter in pretty good time. Which Way and I only took a break to worship and made it to camp before 7PM. By the way, we passed the 600 mile mark along the way today! Huck and Ray stopped there for the night, while the rest of us pressed on for a few more hard miles. Although we did not have any single ascents or descents over 600’ today, our total ups and downs over the 21 miles exceeded 4,000’, so we were pretty spent when we got to the shelter. By the time we set up camp, took care of our hiker work, and ate our BLTs, it was dusk. Sleep will soon follow on this cool night, under a full moon, with the faint sound of a nearby spring trickling down the mountain.

We are anticipating another big day tomorrow (really today now). The good news, it is 5AM as I am finishing this journal entry, so we should get an early start. Hopefully I can get another hour of sleep before the sun rises on another promising AT day.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588616,"Brutal! I could stop there, but I guess you are looking for more details. Each day before we set out on our hike, we discuss where we want to try to end the day. Sometimes we have a regular goal and a stretch goal (time permitting and we are feeling it). Today our stretch goal was Woods Hole Hostel. The elevation profile between Jenny’s Knob Shelter and the road looked pretty tame, other than the final climb up Sugar Run Mountain. But the elevation profile rarely tells the whole story. The big three omissions are rocks, roots, and mud (add snow and ice in the winter). You guessed it, we hiked through, over, and around all three.

It was an early and cool start out of Jenny Knob Shelter. After an initial descent followed by a moderate climb, we hiked along a ridge for most of the morning. Ridge lines look nice from a distance, but we have learned to associate them with rocks, as that’s usually what you get at the top. While this ridge had its share of rocky terrain, we have certainly encountered worse. So we steadily hiked our way along the ridge, with views to adjacent ridge lines and the green farmland below. One thing was notably different about the distant mountains, they were no longer just shades of brown. At least below 3,000’ the mountains were clothed in light greens, yellows, and reds. Spring was finally taking hold. 

About five miles into the hike we emerged from the woods into a colorful pasture with lush green grass, yellow budded trees, and an assortment of wild flowers. Then, just as the trail was joining a wide river and dropping to a road below, I received a text from Heartburn. He informed us that he made a detour to Trent’s Grocery, a country store that could be accessed from the upcoming road crossing. He also attached a pic of the wall menu. Thanks for tempting us, Heartburn! Never letting the opportunity to take in calories pass us by, we crossed the road, stashed our packs, and walked a half mile down to the country store and grill. As we walked, we called in an order for BBQ sandwiches and fries, which were nearly ready when we arrived. Never mind that it was not even lunch time yet. The owner gave us a lift back up the hill and we were back to hiking within 45 minutes from when we dropped our packs. Heartburn and a hiker named Hip Cat, a retired teacher, went to the trail on the south side of the road to retrieve their packs as we went to the north side to grab our packs. It is the last time we  them for saw them the rest of the day.

The trail here was still wet and muddy from all of the recent rain. Throw in some roots and it made for slow going. Soon the trail was winding along above Dismal Creek. For the next several miles, we were hiking through Rhododendron tunnels just above the clear, swift running creek. The trail here was good except for the occasional mud bog to work around. The path crossed over multiple streams along the way. About 11 miles into our hike we stopped to soak our feet in one of the ice-cold streams. A few miles later we entered into a strand of tall, scantily clothed pine trees, where the sun beamed through, making it a bit warm. There were lots of roots through this stretch. Somewhere along there we ran into Poe, Savage and Spartacus (their dog). The last time we had seen them was at Overmountain Shelter. 

Soon we passed the Wapiti Shelter, marking the beginning of the 1,500’ climb up Sugar Loaf Mountain. No switchbacks here. Instead, the trail we went straight up the mountain in what could easily be mistaken for a creek bed. Undeterred, we put our heads down, drove our poles into the rocky terrain, and worked the hill (work the hill or let the hill work you). After about a mile, with the steepest part of the climb behind us, we stopped at a small stream to water up. We caught up with Butter Knife there, the first we had seen her since the shelter this morning. She asked if we were stopping at the tent site at the top. I responded, “I think we might go all the way (to Woods Hole).” She decided to join in on the ""fun"". 

Within a half mile we were up on the ridge, where the trail softened considerably and the incline became very manageable. What, no rocks on the ridge? Just what the trail doctor ordered. It was about 5PM now and we were only five miles from Woods Hole Hostel, an AT icon. I called the hostel and found out that there were beds available at the bunkhouse and that dinner was at 7PM. We made the decision to press on. The next two miles were fairly easy going and we were feeling good about our decision. Then came the descent, which was filled with rocks of all shapes and sizes. Already exhausted from 19 miles of hiking (if you count the half mile down to Trent’s Grocery), the descent was very difficult to navigate. Our feet took the brunt of the beating coming down. In a word, it was BRUTAL.

By the time we reached the gravel road leading to Woods Hole it was 6:45 and we were whipped. With dinner at 7, there was no time to feel sorry for ourselves and we made the 1/2 mile hike down in 10 minutes. That is another .5 that doesn’t count in our daily A.T. total. 

Needless to say, Woods Hole was a sight for sore eyes, and sore everything else too. This place is very eclectic and the setting is great. More on Woods Hole tomorrow. I’m ending this post on a positive note—delicious dinner, homemade ice cream, shower and a bed to sleep in. Life is sometimes brutal on the AT, but it is always good!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588746,"Woods Hole is one of the oldest hostels on the Appalachian Trail. The 1880’s chestnut log cabin and a bunkhouse were opened by Tillie and Roy Woods in 1986. Granddaughter, Neville, and her husband, Michael, continue the legacy today. There is an emphasis on sustainable living at Woods Hole. The communal meals are prepared with organic and local ingredients. For breakfast Neville served a delicious Apple Glazed French Toast Bake and home baked bread with apple butter. For dinner we were treated to a delicious vegetarian Indian spread. Dessert was homemade ice cream, but this time it was served with cookie crumble. Before each meal, Neville has everyone join hands and we go around the circle, each person saying their name and something for which they are thankful. The meals were the bookends on a wonderful day; however, there was some hiking to do. We had originally planned to take a zero day at Woods Hole, but we had an invitation from a friend who lives nearby to come and stay at her place. Since she is not picking us up until tomorrow, we decided that it would be best to get a few miles in today. Besides, we wanted to make sure everything on our bodies still worked after our punishing hike into Woods Hole. So, after catching a lift back to the trailhead, we hiked into Pearisburg. Butter Knife joined us on what seemed more like a day hike. Since we would be returning to Woods Hole after the hike, we did not need much food or other provisions, so we left things like the tent and cooking gear behind. Now I know what it feels like to be an ultralight hiker. I could get used to this!

The hike started with a gentle ascent. Leg muscles working, check. knees functioning, check...feet holding up, check! Back in action. Unlike yesterday, the trail surface was mostly soft and rock-free and the hiking was easy-peasy. Oh, and it was another gorgeous, sunny day, with signs of Spring all around.  Little yellow, white, purple and lavender wildflowers were scattered along the hike. I also noticed that some of the Mayapples were budding on the stems. The highlights of the hike came after we crested Pearis Mountain. First came Pearis Ledges, a series of open cliffs offering views of Pearisburg. Just a little further down the trail was Angel’s Rest, a rock outcropping that also offered excellent views of Pearisburg and Narrows. From both vantage points we could see two different smoke plumes and some haze in the distance. The smoke just below us may have been controlled burns. However, there is a fire alert for a section of the trail a few days walk north of us. About 20 miles of the trail is currently closed due to wildfires. I am thankful for the firefighters who are dealing with the blaze and hope they can get it under control soon.

The last two miles of the hike were downhill. Unlike yesterday, there were switchbacks over soft ground. Hallelujah! At the bottom of the mountain the trail intersected with Cross Avenue. It was there that we arranged a ride back to Woods Hole from an older gentleman named Tom. The return trip took us right by a Dairy Queen, where Tom “graciously” agreed to let us “fly through” for a bulk order. We treated him to a Blizzard for his troubles.

After we returned to Woods Hole, Which Way and I showered up and took turns of getting a massage (me) and reflexology  (Which Way) from Neville. Just what the muscles needed! A word on Neville, she is small in size, but full of energy and very passionate about offering hikers a great experience at Woods Hole. In the three hours from our return from our hike today, not only was she giving massages, she could also be seen pulling fresh greens from the garden, whipping up dinner, and welcoming arriving hikers. Heartburn showed up earlier in the day and told us that she was carrying large bags of mulch and spreading it as well. She is like the energizer bunny!

Life is good on the AT!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588865,"Last night I had one of my best night’s sleep since we began our adventure. I didn’t wake up until after 7 and had to quickly switch to high gear because breakfast was going to be served at 7:30. I certainly didn’t want to miss out on that! Neville had made a delicious peach crisp with yogurt topping, more scrambled eggs (with spinach mixed in this time), sausage and the famous homemade bread with apple butter. Can’t think of a better start to a Zero day! We had gotten most of our gear packed the night before, because our friend/Trail Angel, Theresa, was coming to pick us up at 9:30 to drive us back to her home in Alderson, WV, just across the state line. She arrived soon after breakfast and we gave her a mini tour of the Woods Hole Hostel before heading out.

Next Step needed to go by Blacksburg, VA (which, unfortunately, just happened to be in the opposite direction of Theresa’s house) to go by an Outfitter to pick up a new Osprey backpack. The one he was using had a busted side zipper, and the Osprey rep asked that he just send a picture of the damage and they would replace the pack if we could go pick it up at the nearest outfitter. Great customer service, Osprey!! Theresa, being a true Trail Angel said that it would be no problem to go get it before heading to Alderson. By the time we left the outfitter it was after 11 so we decided to stop and grab some lunch before making the 90-minute drive to her house. Great idea!!! Especially since there just happened to be a Chick-Fil-a only a couple of miles from the outfitter!!!! I had just mentioned the night before that I could really go for a Chick-Fil-a sandwich, and now I was sitting there eating one not even 24 hours later!! The drive from Blacksburg to Alderson is absolutely beautiful. As we came around the last curve on the backcountry road, Theresa pointed out her farm just ahead. It was even more beautiful than I had imagined! A log cabin nestled in the hillside looked like the perfect place to relax on our Zero Day. We asked about the adorable little cabin that sat just to the right of the house and we couldn’t believe when she told us that was the chicken coop! Are you kidding me?!?! I can’t say I’ve ever seen a 5-star Chicken Resort until today! 
Theresa showed us to our room and I told her there might be a problem...we might not ever leave. “You don’t have to”, she replied. “The farm right across the road is for sale!” We took a tour of part of her property and were stunned to find the most adorable treehouse around back the perfect place to spend the day with a good book! Next Step and I agreed that we would love to have one built when we finish our adventure and settle back down. After our tour, we brought in all of our gear and resupply boxes that we had received the night before and went right to work so that we could get to the most important part of our day - relaxing on the porch! We finally got all of our chores done and Theresa and I got a chance to catch up a bit since it’s been years since we have had a chance to visit. She is a beautiful lady with such a gentle spirit. We were so blessed to be able to have this time together! Theresa is also quite an artist and photographer. Finally, she is our go-to for identifying plants and trees we see along the trail. After an incredible supper featuring Alaskan salmon (that she had caught herself!!), venison with mushroom gravy, mashed potatoes, and broccoli salad, we thought it would be a good idea to take a walk before dessert. We walked through the pasture to a spring and she pointed out lots of different flowers and trees along the way, some of which were the same that we had sent her pictures of to help us identify. Next Step asked if we could walk across the road and take a look at the property that was for sale. As we walked along listening to the birds and the absolute stillness of the evening, it really made us want to move right in. We headed back and decided to have our chocolate cake and milk on the front porch, while Aspen, her yellow lab, played ball in the front yard. Now the sun has gone down and you can hear the water gently flowing in the stream and the crickets chirping. Yes, I’m pretty sure Next Step is going to have to pry my fingers off the gate to get me out of here tomorrow. Tonight I’m feeling grateful for friendships that just pick up right where you left them. Thank you Theresa, you truly are a Trail Angel.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589003,"Is that bacon I smell? Yes, it is! After a good night's sleep in a comfy bed, we were treated to a delicious pancake breakfast. It was an awesome ending to a fabulous stay at the Possum Holler Farm. Although we were not ready to leave, we were pretty certain that Mount Katahdin was not in southern West Virginia and that we had to keep moving on that long slow trail to get to our final destination. Theresa continued to go above and beyond the call of “Trail Angel” duty, dropping us by a Barber Shop, Dollar General, and Post Office on our way back to the trail. As we parted ways at the trailhead on Cross Avenue (where we finished our hike on Tuesday), Theresa said it felt weird to just drive away, leaving us with just the packs on our backs. Oddly, it felt kind of normal to us. However, that doesn’t mean it was easy to start hiking again, especially on a day when the temperature would climb into the upper 80's. But knowing that we had to keep moving, we finally walked back on the trail at around 11:00. 
There was a notable change to the forest over the past two days. The buds on the trees had turned to leaves and the undergrowth had taken off. There was also an abundance of wildflowers and the sounds of returning migratory birds rang through the air.  After a mile or so, we crossed Narrows Road and came upon a bench sitting next to the trail. This was a perfect spot for lunch. A thrush called out from high above in a tree as we enjoyed the roast beef sandwiches that we made at Theresa’s this morning. Yummy! 

Within another mile, the trail joined US 460 and then crossed a long bridge over the New River, putting us on the outskirts of the industrial town of Narrows. On one side of the bridge was a concrete company. On the other side of the river stood a petrochemical plant. Along the river was a busy rail yard. We crossed the bridge with automobiles and big trucks speeding by and a train passing below. “Now, this feels weird,” I thought to myself. I was ready to be back in the solitude of the forest. But first, we would have to endure more weirdness. As we were making the long ascent up Peters Mountain, we passed by a landfill. A bit further up the trail we crossed over VA 641, a gravel road. Here there was some construction-related activity revolving around the Mountain Valley Pipeline. There is some controversy surrounding the pipeline and evidently there are “Tree Sitters” (protesters) in the area. The trail shares the road for about a tenth of a mile. Sitting on the road was a US Forest Service SUV. As we approached the vehicle, a Forest Ranger, wearing a flak vest and body camera, dismounted the vehicle. The professional and friendly young ranger informed us that the area was closed, but that thru hikers were permitted to pass. He went on to instruct us that we must remain on the trail. Weird!

After moving through the “construction” area (limited to a 100 yards on the gravel road used by construction vehicles), we were back in the woods. We never saw a pipeline, a tree sitter, or any damage to the trail. 

Now for the hardest part of the day, the remainder of the 1,700’ ascent to Peters Mountain. The heat of the day was full on now and water was scarce here, so we just slugged along to the top. The combination of the previous Zero Day, heavy packs, steep grade, and heat were taking a toll on us. Eventually we came to an open ridge where the Rice Field Shelter was located. Most of the hikers we saw today were stopping there. However, there was no water source at the shelter, so we pressed on. There were some great views from the field to the bustling valley below. Off in the distance was a visible plume from another fire. After we reentered the woods we could smell smoke. Not sure where that is coming from.

A couple of miles past the shelter we came to a campsite that had a spring nearby. We decided to eat dinner here, water up and continue to hike a bit longer. It was about 6:30PM when we started hiking again. We had planned to hike another hour, but when I caught up with Which Way, she indicated that she had had enough for the day. A little further, she eyed a good spot for our tent and we stopped for the day right at 7PM. 

As the day was winding down I noticed a lot of haze in the valley below. It was weird to see that, but it made for a colorful sunset.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589263,"The day started wonderfully, with a gentle path beneath our feet, coolish temperatures and birds serenading us from high in the trees. The trail here straddled the Virginia and West Virginia border marked by a ridge that extended from Rice Field to Peters Mountain. We had only been walking about a mile when we came upon an area where a Tree Sitter was making a stand against the pipeline that was being run through this area. A colorful sign on our left pointed the way to the protester.  Another sign invited A.T. Hikers to join in the cause. A short distance later a couple of large framed tents were located over the crest of the ridge in the same vicinity as the Tree Sitter. I had only taken a couple of steps off the trail in the direction of the large tents when a Forestry Service Official emerged from one of the tents and walked up to meet me. After exchanging pleasantries, I told him I was curious about what all of the commotion was about. We had a casual conversation about the pipeline, the trail, and the Tree Sitters. The official told me that the pipeline was actually being routed through the mountain and under the AT. Although I could hear work activity below, I could not see the pipeline or construction from my vantage point. When I asked him where the Tree Sitter was located he pointed back down the mountain just beyond the large tents. I could barely make out the silhouette of a person perched in a tree. The official also pointed out a small tent under the tree, informing me that it was being used by the sitter's support team. Finally, I asked him about damage to the trail. He responded that the Forest Service did drive some ATVs on the trail when the tensions between the Mountain Valley Employees and the Tree Sitters first erupted. He also said that the “damage” to the trail and any other areas damaged as a result of the pipeline project would be restored. When I returned to the trail I noticed about a 1/4 mile stretch where the ATVs had been driven. Straw had already been laid over the wheel tracks and I am confident that Mother Nature will take care of the rest. 

The walk down the ridge was very scenic. Wild flowers and cherry, apple and pear trees are abundant in the area. As I was taking it in, two individuals wearing safety vests and hard hats approached. I thought that they were construction workers. As it turned out, the man and woman are professional Bird Counters and are part of an environmental consulting team responsible for providing oversight of the pipeline project. When I asked if the company was compliant, he said that he had to admit that they were operating to high environmental standards. They, being bird people, and me being me, I asked them for a quick tutorial about some of the birds I was hearing. They shared some characteristics of three species—Indigo Bunting, Eastern Towhee, and Scarlet Tanager. Before we parted ways they agreed to let me take a picture of the two of them (see photo gallery).

The ridge ended at Peters Mountain and the trail began to descend. A short distance further I saw a couple of colorful gals approaching from the opposite direction. When I stopped to chat with the friendly ladies, I found out they were part of the Tree Sitter support team and were returning with supplies. When I asked them what their concerns were with the pipeline, they responded that if there was a leak, gas would seep into the aquifer. That doesn’t sound good! As it turns out, this is not the first pipeline protest they have taken part in. They were not happy with how the Forestry Service was handling this particular project. They conveyed a lot of information for my consideration. We had a nice conversation and I appreciate the passion that the two of them pour into their cause. Concerned that Which Way might make it to Katahdin without me, I needed to cut our conversation off. They posed for a picture before we parted ways (see photo gallery). 

As I moved on, the sounds of chainsaws waned, but the songbirds persisted in ringing out their melodious tunes. Which Way had stopped to stretch and let me catch up to her. It was mid-morning now and the sun was breaking through the clouds. With still very little canopy to block the rays the day heated up quickly. It would be nine miles from where we started for the day until our first source of water, so we went into conservation mode. As we made our way to the Pine Swamp Branch Shelter, we walked through a stand of Ash Trees. Sadly, all of the Ashes in North America will eventually meet the same fate brought on by the Gypsy Moth. The Swamp Branch Shelter was actually closed (to camping) due to dead and fallen trees in the area.

When we arrived at the shelter there were already a couple of hikers inside. A half dozen more would soon show up. Everyone was seeking refuge from the hot sun. Which Way prepared lunch as I went to fetch water and start the filtering process. We both took our shoes and socks off and put them in the sun to dry.

After we ate, Which Way was tending to her blisters, including a new one that formed the day before. When she removed the tape from that blister, the tape caught on it revealing a bloody open wound. She cleaned up the wound and dressed it the best she could, but it was evident that she needed some time off the trail to clean it properly and to let her feet heal. The closest road intersection was VA 235, a gravel road 2.5 miles down the mountain. As she hobbled along we discussed options. I told her that I could take a couple of days off with her, but she did not want to slow our overall progress (we need to complete this journey before Labor Day). In the end, we decided to get her a ride 50 or so miles up the trail while I continued to hike. For a woman who has been referred to as Bad-A, Tough Nut, etc. it was hard for her to admit that it was the best thing to do. WW has demonstrated incredible intestinal fortitude out here, enduring what most cannot fathom. But, this is a marathon, and the goal is to finish together. To that end, it was the right decision. We could always come back to allow her to complete this section sometime in the future.

Now that the decision was made, we just needed to find her a ride out of the wilderness. I wanted to call a shuttle, but was unable to get cell service. So when we were about a half mile from the road, I raced ahead to see if I could make some trail magic happen (sometimes these things need a little  prompting). There was a parking lot about a 100 yards from where the trail intersected the road. I walked that way in search of magic. Just as I was approaching the parking area, an SUV was pulling out. I motioned the driver as if I had a question. He stopped. Occupying the vehicle was a pristine couple just a bit older me. It would not be easy to convince them to drive a stinky hiker 30+ miles and deliver her to a hostel. My first objective was simply to establish a relationship. As I approached the passenger side (trying not to get so close that they could smell me) I noticed that the wife had a bird book in her lap. Perfect! I introduced myself as an AT hiker and told them I was out here with my wife. I then added that I was an up and coming bird novice (fresh off my first tutorial). I could tell the husband was growing inpatient and wondering where this conversation was going. Just as I thought he might roll up the window and leave me standing in the dust, I saw it. Trail Magic, that is! It was on the ladies collar about to crawl on her neck. “Oh ma’am, you have a tick on you. Let me get it for you.” Now that I had plucked a tick off the nice lady, I was in a better position to ask a favor in return. I explained the situation and asked if they would be so kind as to deliver my wife to the Four Pines Hostel. As it turns out, it was in the opposite direction as they were headed and the husband still seemed skeptical. But, how could he say no to the man who just saved his wife from some tick-borne disease.  

Just as I got to yes, Which Way emerged from the wild. After brief introductions, I told WW the arrangement and made sure she had the address and phone number of the Four Pines Hostel. As the other woman was out of the car removing more ticks, I took all of WW's food, hoping that would be enough to get me to Four Pines without any re-supply. As the vehicle pulled away, I took a picture of the license plate. Then I had a moment of panic. Would my wife get ticks from these folks?

It wasn’t long after I resumed my hike that, for the first time in over 650 miles, I felt alone on the trail. My inseparable partner was no longer with me. While we don’t always hike one behind the other, we are never more than 30 minutes apart on the trail. Until now! No time to wallow in it, I still had seven tough miles to hike, much of it over rocks. They were the annoying kind that slow progress and tire your feet and joints. 

Thick clouds were rolling in and dark was coming early. I stopped at a campsite just past Wind Rocks where two other hikers were already tucked inside their tents. Just as I was setting up my house for the night, the clouds opened up, soaking me and the inside of my shelter. As soon as the tent was up I climbed inside with my pack and started sopping up water with my sock. It was dark now and I opted for a PBJ wrap for dinner. Soon I was under my quilt trying to warm my wet bones. As I laid on my back staring at the top of my tent, it hit me. I am alone.

Please keep Which Way in your prayers.

I love that tough nut!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589352,"When I stepped outside the tent at 1AM to pay a visit to Mother Nature, the fog was as thick as molasses. After I found my way back to the tent and crawled under my quilt I quickly realized that I wasn’t getting back to sleep anytime soon. I decided to work on the previous day’s journal entry and it was after 4AM before I finally got back to sleep. Oh well, at least the journal was nearly finished. At first light I was awakened by “tow-hee drink your tea, tow-hee drink your tea...!”  Apparently, this is the only tune that the eastern Towhee knows, and he persists in singing it over and over and over again. Knowing that getting more sleep was a futile effort, I crawled out of my cocoon, ate breakfast and packed up my wet tent. It dawned on me then that it’s been awhile since I had to pack a wet tent, and for that I was grateful.

 

I commenced to taking off at 7:30, with two other hikers pushing out just before me. When I got to the end of the ridge (Lone Pine Peak), I checked my phone for a signal. To my surprise, it was pretty strong. I decided I would go ahead and post the Day 71 journal entry before continuing further on my hike. Usually Which Way serves as the senior editor, as I make all kinds of mistakes while typing in the middle of the night. She happily cleans up dangling participles and no telling what else before handing me back the phone so I can make a post to the website. But today I was on my own. So I spent about 15 minutes actually rereading my post and making edits. It was then that I really appreciated the work that she does each and every day. Satisfied that I had a good journal entry, I attempted to upload the final draft. I don’t know if I was distracted by the songbirds or what, but somehow I managed to delete the whole thing! That hurt!! I tried feverishly to get it back, to no avail. Not wanting to forget the highlights (the days tend to run together out here), I ended up just making notes for later. Then, I googled “how to undo in notes pages.” It was then that I learned that you simply have to shake the phone up and down vigorously.  I tried that, but I had already messed it up too badly. I saw that Which Way had texted and I wanted to give her a call to see how she was doing. I was actually calling to check in on her and see how her foot was healing, but I ended up venting about my failed effort to get the journal entry on the website. She could tell I was distraught and just listened patiently. She has a real knack for that! What a wonderful character trait.

As I continued to hike I felt physically sick. I was kind of nauseous and a little clammy. It was the first time I hadn’t felt well the entire hike. It was probably some combination of being upset over the failed post, the high humidity, shaking my I-phone up-and-down, staring at it for too long, and trying to peer up into the trees, straining to see the songbirds. I continued down the hill to War Spur Shelter, the first of four shelters I’d pass that day. When I arrived, I did some more stretches hoping that the slow breathing that goes with the routine might help me feel better. It really didn’t help much. 

After hiking down a little more I started to climb. Today’s total ascent ended up being around 4,300’, the bulk of it coming over two climbs. The first climb, totaling about 2,000’, was up to Kelly’s Knob. It was a fairly steep climb with the last part on an old road bed that went straight up the mountain. There were an abundance of chipmunks and fat squirrels on top of Kelly’s Knob. I guess they were fat and happy from eating nuts from all the oak and hickory trees on top of the knob.

As I descended Kelly’s Knob, I heard the sound of thunder. Danger Close! I could see the rain coming in a thick black cloud from the bottom of the mountain as I hiked down into it. It was .6 miles to the Laurel Creek Shelter and I decided to make a run for it. I was about two tenths of a mile out from the shelter when a really loud crash of thunder exploded above me and with it the sky opened up. When I made it to the shelter I was already pretty wet. But, the rain continued to fall for a while and I was happy to be inside the shelter with eight Boy Scouts and their Troop leaders. My phone was low on battery so I asked if anyone had an extra boost in their power pack. One of the scout leaders said he did and allowed me to get about a 20% charge. They were just out for the weekend and offered up some food so I took some Cliff Bars as well. I had to make it two more days and was wondering how I was going to get by with the little food that I had left. Trail magic! 

After the rain stopped, the Scouts headed trail south. I ate one of the Cliff Bars, stopped by the stream to filter enough water to last the rest of the hike, and continued down the mountain. Soon the Mountain Laurel gave way to other vegetation, including a couple of large Mayapple colonies. On one plant, in one of the colonies, I saw my first Mayapple flower of the hike. It was neat finally seeing one of the flowers after watching the plants grow and produce buds for weeks. Now, I’m not usually a flower and bird type of guy. However, being on the A.T., where things come at you much more slowly, causes me to appreciate the smaller wonders of God’s creation. 

The trail passed through fields and pastures for about a mile on either side of VA 630. The second significant climb, appropriately named Bruisers Knob, started just north of VA 630. Just as the trail was about to start up and into the forest, it passed by Kefler Oak. At over 300 years old, it is the largest oak tree on the AT south of the Mason Dixon Line, measuring 18’ around. A short distance after cresting Bruisers Knob, I had a decision to make. I was standing at the trailhead for the blue blaze path leading .3 miles down the path to Sarver Hollow Shelter. Although I was pretty worn out and running low on water, it was only 5PM and I was still over 24 miles from Four Pines Hostel (and Which Way). A quick look at Guthook showed that the next shelter was only 6.5 miles out. Where I was standing, the trail was soft and sloping gently upwards to Sinking Creek Mountain. In three more miles it would start a long descent down the mountain. The downside was that I was running low on water and I would be rolling into camp late and tired (and 2 days behind on the journal). Then I noticed something else on Guthook. Just 1.5 miles after the next shelter (Niday), was a road crossing. VA 621 was only 8 road miles to the Four Pines Hostel. Although I would get there late, I could get a shower, perhaps something good to eat, and have a much shorter hike on Sunday. Most importantly, I could put eyes on Which Way, who I gather was not digging being without me at the hostel. I had a good signal, so I made a quick call to Which Way to see what she thought about the plan. Of course, she loved it, so I asked her to ask Joe (the hostel owner) to pick me up at 8:30PM. The trail continued to be smooth for about another two miles. But nothing is smooth on the AT for very long. On the last two miles along the ridge I found myself walking along ledges, mostly on large slanted slabs of limestone rock. It was also raining again, making the rocks very slick under my over-worn shoe treads. Since my muscles were now beyond fatigued, I had to carefully choose my steps, looking for creases in the limestone. Needless to say, my pace slowed significantly. I was starting to get concerned about having to hike part of the way down the mountain in the dark. There were several hilltops along the ridge that were barely a blip on the elevation profile. Each time I would work my way over one set of rocks, the next hill would come into view. The entire ridge ran along the Eastern Continental Divide and a sign marked the ECD on the last hilltop. I called Joe from there to let him know that I was on the home stretch. It was still rough going for a bit, but eventually the path softened and flattened out some. My feet hurt! Starting with the burning calluses on my big toes, continuing through my flattening arches and my bruised heels, and up to my tender Achilles’ tendons. I ran when I could just to change the foot strike in hopes of reducing the pain. I passed by Niday Shelter with its optimal tent sites. “That would have worked.” Oh well, I was committed now. When I hit the final switchback, I saw the Four Pines Shuttle Truck pull into the parking area. Perfect timing!

15 minutes later, Joe had me back at his hostel (a converted auto garage). Which Way was standing in the gravel drive waiting to greet me. It was a sweet sight for sore--everything! I don’t think I would have had the energy to fix dinner if I had stayed at the last shelter. But, I wasn’t at the shelter, and when I got out of the shower WW had a pizza with all my favorite toppings heated up and ready for me to eat. Oh, and for dessert, chocolate chip cookies and a cold cup of milk. I knew then that I had made the right decision.

It was soon past hiker's midnight and the lights were going out at the full hostel. The past due journal would have to wait until after my nightly nap.

I’m back with my Which Way and life is so good!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589380,"The first victory of the day was simply waking up. As beat down as I felt after yesterday’s hike, I wasn’t taking that for granted. Which Way would take one more day to let her feet heal as I finished the section from VA 621 to the Four Pines Hostel. At 7:30 I was the first one to get a ride out with Joe. By 8AM I was hiking up Brush Mountain Easy. I felt really good out of the gate this morning—Victory 2. I easily managed the gentle ascent with a dreamy path (soft, dry, and wide) under my feet and a light pack (I left our tent back at the hostel for WW to dry on the line) on my back. The light rain that was falling when I started hiking quickly moved out of the area, however, it returned on and off throughout the day. 
As I eased along I dictated the Day 72 Journal into my phone. I planned to edit what was lost in translation later. For instance, Siri heard “stretch and breathe” as “stretch and breed”.  
Anyway, after a series of switchbacks I was on a wide ridge that gently sloped up to the top of the mountain. What’s this? A bench to sit on? You don’t see many of those along the AT. The field of view to my front was excellent due to the wide straight path. A hawk swooped down from a branch in front of me and soared about 100 yards up the path. When I got within 25 yards from where the glorious creature was perched I started to reach for my camera. Too late, he had already dropped off the branch and glided another 100 yards up the trail. Thinking he would do the same again, I kept my camera out to capture the next swoop and glide. As I approached the tree he was now in I could clearly see the majestic bird stationed on a large limb overhanging the trail. Without a zoom lens on my phone camera, I knew that I would have to get closer or wait for the bird to repeat its flight further up the trail. To my dismay, when he came off the branch, he flew away from the trail and into the wooded area. Oh well, you can’t win them all.

Towards the end of the ridge was a side trail leading to a monument dedicated to Audie Murphy, the most decorated WWII Veteran. It marked the spot where he died in a plane crash on May 28, 1971. On a personal note, about 8 years ago, my family and I visited another monument dedicated to Audie Murphy. This particular monument was located north of Holtzwihr, in the Alsace District of Southeastern France. It marked the spot where he had earned his medal of honor, fending off German tanks, on January 26, 1945. One other hiker was at the site using his phone. I think he was a SOBO section hiker. He was the first and last hiker I saw until I reached the Dragon's Tooth, another 10 Miles up the trail. Yesterday, other than the two hikers I was camped with, I only saw one other NOBO thru hiker on the trail and one Flip Flopper named Clank. I figured that by now the big hiker bubble would have caught up. I am starting to think it has really thinned out behind us. 

After another climb up Cove Mountain, I paused for lunch at a spot with a view. There would be many spectacular views in multiple directions for the remaining 5 miles of the hike. There were a few small rock obstacles to scramble over on the way to Dragon's Tooth, but nothing too bad. In fact, I was enjoying the challenge. Somewhere in this stretch I passed the 700 mile mark—Victory 3! It was probably marked with sticks, but I wasn’t even thinking about it. Thus, I failed to look for the spot. 

I made really good time getting to Dragon's Tooth, a milestone on the trail—Victory! Up to then, the trail had not been nearly as technical as, after years of reading about it, I expected it to be. There was a short side trail leading down to the spectacular monolith that earned the name Dragon’s Tooth. It is a very popular spot for Day Hikers, so I was surprised to see only one other person down there. She was the girlfriend of a thru hiker named Backward Hat. Two other hikers without packs were exiting Dragon’s Tooth as I entered the side trail. I later caught them going down and learned that they actually tented at the Four Pines last night and were just hiking a short piece today. 

It wasn’t long into my descent that I realized what all the fuss about Dragon’s Tooth was about. There were some pretty steep rock ledges to negotiate. In a couple of spots, metal stair rungs were mounted into the limestone. I put my poles away and carefully worked my way down the wet rocks. I think this one would have been a lot more fun as a SOBO. Nonetheless, I was having a great day. There were more excellent vantage points on the descent, including one outcropping where I could see the Four Pines Hostel below. Many bushes and flowers were also hitting peak bloom - Rhododendrons, Lady Slippers, Dwarf Iris, Flame Azaleas and Pink Fire, to name a few. Thanks to Joe's wife, Donna,  I was able to get the names of all of the flower pics before posting them to the photo gallery. I hit VA 624 at 3PM and walked about 1/3 of a mile up the busy road to the hostel. Which Way met me outside again. This time I was ready. I handed her a beautiful Rhododendron bloom I picked before exiting the trail. She was telling all the young hikers, “Look, after 30 years, he still stops to pick me flowers”. Music to my ears—Victory 5! 

By 4PM I was showered and we were on our way to the Home Place Restaurant. It sits on a huge farm in a 1907 home and serves all-you-can-eat family style platters of delicious food. The place is only open Thursday-Sunday, so I was happy it worked out for me (it was WW's third visit-lol)—Victory 6! Laura, our server, was delightful. She left us wanting for nothing. We returned to the hostel well before dark and I was able to catch up on my journaling—Victory 7! We also visited with several hikers we have not seen in a while—TNT, Crafty & Blackbird, Poe & Savage (and Spartacus), Life Alert, and Josh. 

Slaying Dragons today and back on the trail with my partner in life tomorrow. Life is good on the AT.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589522,"I had already decided last night that I was getting back on the trail with Next Step today even if I had a bone sticking out! I have never been good at relaxing, and I had been SITTING for 2 1/2 days in the middle of nowhere, just wishing I was hiking with my Next Step! I even woke up on my own before 7, which is a big deal. Of course, Next Step was already up and finishing up yesterday’s journal. He was so glad to be caught back up! We started our day with scrambled eggs which were fresh from the free- range chickens that live at four Pines Hostel. There is nothing like fresh eggs!! We had also saved a country ham biscuit from last night’s supper to go with our eggs. One thing for sure, it was all much better than my normal breakfast of instant grits. It didn’t take long to eat and get packed up. I was soooo ready to go! Midnight gave a few of us hikers a short ride back to the trail head. 
Plod Along, Grandma Shortie and Half Moon (three hikers we had met at Woodshole Hostel) were already at the trailhead when we arrived. Next Step and I hiked in almost a mile and stopped to filter our water and stretch. I was feeling really well, but was just super worried that my blister would come back. I honestly was worried that I wouldn’t be able to hike up the mountain after so much time off and all the food I had eaten while I was healing my foot. So far, so good. We hiked through a meadow and the trail continued to be soft under our feet. Next Step had told me how the flowers and trees had come to life, but it was even more than I had expected. Everywhere you looked was a different kind of flower and a different color...so beautiful!!! 
Just before we started our climb up to the highlight of our day, we stopped at John's Spring Shelter to filter more water and have lunch. Next Step walked down the hill from the shelter and ran into a group of firefighters that were working on a restoration project from last week’s fire. As we headed north we saw the charred remains of the forest floor for about a mile, the air still smelling of smoke. The fire had stopped at the trail, which thankfully, had kept it from spreading farther into the woods. We continued to ascend and finally reached McAfee Knob!!! This was a day we had dreamed about for years. McAfee Knob is probably one of the most iconic sites on the AT, mainly because of the amazing photo op of hikers sitting on the edge of the cliff. Unfortunately, just as we walked up, a thru hiker was just finishing up his photo shoot in his birthday suit!! Seriously?!?! I can never “unsee” that! 
Next Step (wearing ALL of his clothes, lol) was brave enough to dangle his feet over the edge of the huge rock formation that jutted out from McAffee Knob, but not me! However, I have definitely gotten braver from my days on the trail. A year ago I probably wouldn’t have even thought about getting anywhere near the edge and now here I was just inches away!!! We hung out with a few of our hiker friends before heading on to our next exciting spot for the day, Tinker Cliffs. We had heard that the views from the Cliffs were even more spectacular than those at McAfee Knob. First, we had to do a bit of a rock scramble through The Ledges. However, there was just one problem. The closer we were getting to the cliffs, the darker the sky was getting to our west. Next Step checked the radar and there were several storm cells headed our way. Now I can think of several places I would enjoy being when a storm passes, but on top of the cliffs on the side of a mountain wasn’t anywhere on the list!!! The only good thing about that situation was that it helped me COMPLETELY forget about my blisters for the two mile hike up to the cliffs and the 1.5 mile hike down to the shelter. We had a pretty good climb up. I just put my head down and dug in my trekking poles. Sadly, when we reached the top, we couldn’t even really stop to enjoy the absolutely incredible views because we wanted to keep moving to beat the storm. It started sprinkling just as we reached the top, so I put it into even higher gear to get down. We decided we would just camp in the shelter just in case the storms moved in. Not only would we not have to deal with a wet tent, but we would be able to get a quicker start in the morning. He didn’t have to convince me. I eagerly agreed because tomorrow is TOWN DAY!!! I obviously do not need more relaxation time, but Next Step is way overdue!! Not only was he cranking out crazy miles, but I know he was going at warp speed just so he could get back to me. So even though it’s not QUITE as exciting as it normally is because I’m still full from my 3 nights in a row at the all-you-can-eat country cooking buffet, the thoughts of a hot shower and a real bed to sleep in are enough to get this hiking gal up at 6 am and ready to go!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589637,"Before we even took a step in the state of Virginia, we were being told how easy it would be. “The last of the big mountains until New England.” You will be busting out big miles!” Blah, blah, blah. Easy? Well, the first 250 miles of Virginia were anything but easy. Yes, we left the 6K+ mountain tops behind in Tennessee and North Carolina. Yes, we have been hiking more miles per day. However, part of the bigger miles is due to simply having more daylight hours to hike. But the terrain has been very challenging at times and we have experienced plenty of steep ups and downs. In fact, the total ascents has been about 55,000’ throughout the southern portion of Virginia. Of course, what goes up, must also come down (another 55,000’). So, we kept waiting for easy, but never found it. That is until today!

After a good, dry, mice-free, and snore-free sleep, we were out of the Lambert’s Meadow Shelter and headed to Daleville at 7AM. It ended up raining pretty hard last night, so we were glad we decided to shelter instead of tent. It made for a quicker departure and meant that we would not have to dry the tent out when we got to town. The trail surface was nearly perfect for most of our 10 mile hike into town and the ups and downs were not too steep. There were a few obstacles (big rocks) to work our way around and over, but no long stretches of rock strewn trail. The best part, we were treated to really cool geological formations and some amazing views to the south (Roanoke/Blacksburg) and north (Troutville/Daleville). The miles were small and easy and the smiles were big and wide as we passed by/over ledges, monoliths and rock outcroppings. Simply put, it was a fun hike!

Early in the hike we came up behind Plod Along and Grandma Shorty and hiked/chatted with them for a couple of miles before moving on. We reached the interstate town of Dalesville by noon and walked straight to the Super 8 where we will be lodging for a couple of nights. The rooms here are nice and clean and the staff are very hiker friendly. As luck would have it, a Mexican restaurant sitting right next door just opened last week. So, we dropped our packs in the room and started the calorie intake. The shower could wait. 

After getting cleaned up we headed out for a shopping center that had an outfitter, coffee shop, grocery store, and BBQ restaurant all in the same location. Although the shopping center was located just .7 miles from the hotel, the walk was along a very busy highway with no sidewalk. Plus, it started to rain just as we got ready to step outside. So, we decided to call a local Trail Angel named Homer to see if we could get a ride. The 80ish year old man was there to pick us up within 5 minutes. When I asked Homer what his connection to the AT was, he replied that he and his wife maintain 16 shelters in the area. WOW! Thank you Homer!

Which Way and I both need new shoes, so we hit the outfitter first. She found what she was looking for, along with some new socks, but the small outfitter did not carry the shoes I wanted. My LaSportiva Trail Runners are getting pretty torn up from snagging them on jagged rocks and catching roots on the toe box. I sure hope I can get another 100 miles out of them before I pick up a new pair in Waynesboro. 

We ran into the usual group of hikers at the shopping complex. We also ran into a nice young couple named Espresso and Clover, who we hadn’t seen since the Sassafras Shelter just north of the NOC. We finished our shopping and hit the Three Little Pigs for some yummy ribs before walking back to the hotel. 

It was a good day with lots of smiles!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589751,"What do you call a group of hikers? Wait for it.......................................................................................A Hobble! What do hikers do on Zero day? As little as possible. Unless, of course you are Which Way & Next Step. In that case you find something to do to fill the time void. 
Which Way tried unsuccessfully to sleep in this morning. I didn’t even attempt it. After showers we caught an Uber to Cracker Barrel for breakfast. Then we caught a ride back to the Outfitter, where WW purchased the shoes that she picked out yesterday.  While she was in there, I walked across the parking lot to Wendy’s to get her a Coke Zero. When I walked in the door I was surprised to see Heartburn standing there. He informed me he had decided to stop hiking and was getting a ride home with a friend. I knew he had been contemplating this for days, but I was still saddened by the news. He said that he had already gotten everything he wanted from his post-retirement hike and was ready to move on to other things, not the least of which was his 7 year old son. Heartburn has been with us more than not from the beginning and it is hard to see him go. He indicated that Butter Knife (who is about 2 days behind us) was pretty sad about it as well. Which Way reached out to her later in the day. I also talked to Close Call today. He has been dealing with a knee injury since Roan Mountain and is currently at his home in Blacksburg waiting to get a doctor’s assessment on whether or not he can continue his hike without doing any further damage.  As far as we know, Spiritman and Finn & Happy Feet are still on the trail a day or two behind us.

We quickly ran out of things to do on our Zero Day, so we decided to go see a movie in Roanoke (about a 20 minute drive from Daleville). I called our local Trail Angel, Homer, to see if he was headed that way anytime today. He said he was and would swing by around 1PM to give us a lift. The theater was located near an outfitter and I was able to find a new pair of hiking shoes too. We also had time to walk around the mall before the movie started. We felt a little out of place strolling through the mall, not to mention riding down the interstate or going to a movie. 
There was only one other person in the theater on a Wednesday afternoon. Which Way struck up a conversation with her when the movie ended. The sweet woman, Cathy, ended up giving us a ride back to Daleville. She said that her and her husband once hitchhiked across the country, so she knew what it was like to need a ride. Cathy dropped us at a pizza place about 1.5 miles from the Super 8. We walked down the busy US 220 to get back to the hotel, stopping at Kroger on the way to grab a few more resupply items. And that’s what a “relaxing” day. for Which Way and Next Step looks like.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589882,"It always seems to be a little more difficult to get going the day after a Zero. Today was no different. Fortunately the first couple of miles were relatively flat. The trail here paralleled I-81, eventually crossing under the busy interstate. Then came US 11, another open pasture, and finally we were back in the forest, where we belong. It was heating up early today, so we were happy to have the now thick canopy above to provide shade. We spent most of the morning climbing up Fullhardt Knob, before descending to Curry Creek, where we took a break for lunch. On the menu was a delicious sandwich we picked up from the Kroger deli. Grabbing a sandwich for our first lunch or dinner coming off of a re-supply has become our modus operandi. 
After lunch we hiked about an hour before we heard the sound of thunder. I had a good signal most of the day, so I was able to bring up the radar on my phone. There was a pretty decent size storm heading our way and a special weather statement scrolling across the top of the screen indicating that we were under a severe thunderstorm watch until 5PM. It was about another mile uphill to the Wilson Creek Shelter, so we put it in high gear in hopes of making it to cover before the storm hit. We did. Another look at the radar showed that the storm missed us just to the north, but there was a larger cell still headed our way. We decided to hang out at the shelter and take a siesta until the storm passed. It never made it across the mountains before falling apart. As we were sitting inside the shelter, a man and woman came up the hill pulling a heavy-duty dolly with an eighty pound fire ring attached. It was Homer (our Daleville Trail Angel) and his wife Theresa. They had come a mile and a half up a side trail to the shelter to take out the old fire grate and put in the new ring. They will be doing this at all 16 of the shelters they maintain. The two of them wasted no time getting started. Theresa began clearing debris and excess dirt/soot from the spot, while Homer took a sledgehammer to some concrete around the old grate (which they would haul back down). Theresa looked to be 20 years younger than Homer. She was also one hard-working woman, clearing out rocks with a pick ax and removing debris from the area, one shovel scoop at a time. Homer joked that she was in charge. He wasn’t joking though. It didn’t feel right to sit there and watch the two of them do all of the work, so I jumped in to help. Within 15 minutes the shiny new fire ring was installed. Where are the steaks? Theresa said that the two of them and one other gentleman erected this particular shelter back in the late 1980’s and the two of them continue to take care of it to this day. That is dedication! A big shout out to Homer and Theresa and everything they do to improve and maintain the A.T. in this area. 
After the project was done, we took a moment to admire our work, fist bumped Homer and Theresa, and resumed our hike. After a few miles we reached the Blue Ridge Parkway. We ended up crossing it at scenic view sites several times before the end of the day. Our hike ended with a race against another storm that also never arrived. Our final destination was the Bobblets Gap Shelter, which was located about 1/4 mile down hill from the trail. Just before we arrived, a section hiking couple was coming back up the trail stating that the water flow was good, but the shelter was full and there were no tent sites left. There were several section hikers staying in the shelter along with several thru hikers. Fortunately we knew all of the thru hikers and they were eager to accommodate. Besides, Which Way had had enough after over 18 miles on a hot day and she was not going back up that hill. We ended up pitching our tent next to Life Alert right on the path to the privy. 
Two final notes. First our new shoes held up fine. No new blisters for Which Way and the back of my heels felt much better at the end of the day. Finally, I heard back from Spirit Man. He was at Catawba today (about 3 days behind us) and doing fine.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590017,"Today was about friendship and hospitality. After a short hike featuring great views along the Blue Ridge Parkway and a beautiful floral display, we hit VA 614. Just a short distance from the trail is the Middle Creek Campground, a popular resupply point. But for us, it is where we finished today’s hike. An Army friend of mine, Curt Wesson, his wife, Susan, and their grandson, Christopher, had driven over 300 miles (from Columbia, SC), with a 32 foot camper in tow, for the sole purpose of seeing us and treating us to good food and relaxation. In my penultimate Army assignment, Curt and I served together as a Brigade-level command team. We formed a strong bond underpinned by trust, loyalty and complimentary leadership styles and built a lasting friendship. Command Sergeant Major Wesson had a knack for teaching through story telling. These stories were affectionately referred to as Wesson’s Lessons. My favorite all time story was about the time he went to the county clerk to get a fishing license and ended up with a marriage license. I can’t remember the “lesson” from that one, but it was a great story. Obviously, she was a keeper, as he and Susan remain together to this day. They make a great team, something I love to see. Curt picked Which Way and I up at the trail head and brought us back to their campsite. I asked him where he wanted us to set up the tent and he replied, “That won’t be necessary, you two are staying in the queen bed tonight.” The royal treatment continued from there. We walked in the camper to greet Susan and she was waiting with pulled pork sandwiches and bratwurst. Of course, a cold Coke Zero was ready for Which Way. The other bookend on the meals was a delicious grilled steak served with a tasty salad, huge baked potato,corn on the cob and Texas toast. The hospitality did not stop there, as they continued to meet all of our hiker needs. Curt prides himself on having every tool and supply that might be needed on hand. He did not fail today. I even got a resupply of duct tape to wrap around my hiking poles. In between all of the hospitality, we sat back and listened to some Wesson Lessons.  We even had a few (trail) stories of our own to contribute. Curt  and I sat outside, huddled around his nifty little propane fire pit, catching up on old times and exchanging stories until well after hiker midnight. The unspoken Wesson Lesson of the day, hospitality can come on wheels (and hit a moving target) and enduring friendships should be celebrated. 
CSM Wesson is in the process of retiring after 32 years of faithful service. Kudos to him for a job well done and a big thanks to Susan for her selfless sacrifice over the years.

With no end to her kindness, she also fixed us up some sandwiches for us to pack for our lunch. Curtis and Susan are an awesome team whose over-the-top generosity will not be forgotten. I am so thankful that they are etched in the memories of our journey.
Middle Creek ran through the center of the campground, which sat at an elevation of 950 feet. The sun had not yet risen over the eastern mountains when we departed, so the air was still cool and damp. The ground was also saturated with dew and I was grateful that we didn’t have to sleep in our tent the night before.

The second of three ascents of the day was over Floyd Mountain (elevation 3,500’). The sun now cast its rays on all sides of the mountains and as we climbed above 3,000 feet there was very little canopy to provide shade. The lather soon turned into dripping sweat as we slugged our way up and over the mountain. Although the trees at that altitude have not reached full bloom, the undergrowth has completely smothered the ground below. Peppered among the undergrowth are a wide variety of colorful wild flowers and blooming bushes.  The magnificent floral display provided some solace on an otherwise hot and strenuous day of hiking.
A short distance after cresting Floyd Mountain we came to Cornelius Creek Shelter. We found refuge from the beaming sun in the small structure and broke out our lunch—shaved beef sandwiches on Hawaiian rolls. Thank you Susan! 
From the shelter, the trail meandered a bit before beginning its assault on Apple Orchard Mountain. With full bellies we were practically sleep-hiking. We came upon a sawed off tree trunk sitting next to the trail. It was partially shady here with a slight breeze; a perfect place for a nap. We rested our eyes for about 15 minutes when another hiker walked by, bringing us out of our semi-coma state. Apparently, the rest did us good, as we now had enough energy to make it to the top of our final climb of the day. Apple Orchard Mtn. peaked out at 4,225 feet. The trail took us right by an FAA Weather Radar Station. You just never know what you will happen upon while hiking the AT! 
As we worked our way down the other side of the mountain we encountered some pretty cool rock formations, some of which provided decent obstacles to work over. One of the interesting rock formations was named The Guillotine. It got its name from a huge bolder that was precariously wedged in the crevice between two walls. 
Now hiking through the Thunder Ridge Wilderness Area, we passed the largest colony of Mayapples we have seen so far. The plants, many in bloom with bashful white flowers, carpeted several acres of the forest floor. Adjacent to the Mayapple colony was a large cluster of Trilliums, which we had been seeing in an array of colors since early in the day. 
Hiking down a gentle slope in the early evening air, the final two miles of our hike were the easiest of the day. Still, at 6:30PM when we arrived at Harrison Ground Spring, where we would camp for the night, we were quite exhausted from a full and hot day of hiking. Snow Angel (from Holland) and The Spaniard (from Barcelona) were already set up when we arrived. Two section hikers filled the limited space just as it was turning dark.
All in all, it was a hot, tough, tiring and beautiful day on the AT. So blessed to experience it all!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590380,"All kids crave approval from their parents. That desire never really goes away, even when we grow older. My mom passed away many years ago (and my dad more recently), but I often find myself thinking lately, “If only mom (or dad) could  see me now!”. I know they would think that our journey is really awesome. Hey, even our children think it is awesome. So now we can say, “Hey kids, look at us now!” That’s pretty cool too. Anyway, Happy Mother’s Day to all of you Moms out there. You have one of the greatest callings of all humankind and wear an awesome title—Mom!
Now, most of you have probably figured out by now that Which Way is a great wife and trail buddy. But, one of the things I love most about her is that she is an absolutely wonderful mom. The love that she has for our children is indescribable and her daily actions put the exclamation point on how deep that love is. She never ever stops being a mom. 
So, our hike started at 6:45, because Which Way wanted to get to town so that she would be available to talk to our kids when they called. I usually get flowers for Which Way on Mother’s Day, but with the help of the A.T. I was able to outdo myself today. As we departed camp I told her that all of the flowers along the hike today were hers to enjoy for Mother’s Day. Of course, the trail did not disappoint.
We had a single significant climb today and it came early in the hike. By 7:30 we were once again drenched in sweat. At the top of the climb we paused for a break and to worship. It is so easy to count our blessings and give thanks out here.
The wildlife was out and about this morning. We ran across a bunny hopping up the trail, two chipmunks playing chase, squirrels, birds and butterflies fluttering about, a deer just off the trail and two snakes. Some of the wildlife actually posed long enough for a pic. 
The final four miles were pretty much downhill. The last  couple of miles were along the James River. At the end of the hike we crossed the 1,000 foot James River Footbridge. It is the longest footbridge on the AT. We had arranged to stay at Stanimal’s  Hostel in the small town of Glasgow, VA (located 6 miles from the trail). The hostel was located 2 miles from town and offered free laundry and a shuttle ride to and from the trailhead. Donna, the hostel caretaker, was also our shuttle driver. We called about two hours out and told her we would hit the parking lot on the other side of the footbridge at 12:15, give or take a few minutes. When we hiked up to the parking lot at 12:14 she was there waiting for us. Donna agreed to drop us off at Scotto’s, the only restaurant open in town, and to take our packs on to the hostel. We were the first to arrive at the hostel. It is really a hiker house with a couple of bunk rooms and a private room. The place is very clean and has everything a hiker could want (except for a new set of feet). After we finished showering, Snow Angel showed up. We did laundry and a few more chores and then all three of us went back to Scotto’s for dinner. We saw Espresso and Clover and a few other hikers while we were eating. They were all staying in the town shelter which has a free shower. Cool! 
After we ate, we crossed the street to get a pic with the  town dinosaur and hit the Dollar General for resupply. Of course, Which Way was able to talk to the kids (more than once) and call her mom as well. I know that made her a happy hiker today!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590548,"Donna did her part to give us a nice send-off today. Before we left the hostel she made us some scrambled eggs with ham and  toast. She loaded up the three of us hikers in her car and we were back at the trailhead and ready to start at 7:45. The forecast was calling for temperatures in the low 90’s today in town, so we were eager to get up and over  Bluff Mountain as early as possible. It was going to be about a nine mile climb with three big ascents totaling over 3,000 Feet- not a good combo!! 
My heart was still aching a bit from not being able to see my mom or my kiddos on Mother’s Day. Even though I am very thankful I had gotten to talk to all of them, it just wasn’t the same. I had made the mistake of getting on Facebook and seeing all the pictures of my friends celebrating the day with their families and I had already had more than one pity party. 
When you’re hiking 8-10 hours a day, you have ALOT of time to think and pray. The latter is obviously a wonderful thing, but the former is not necessarily always such a good thing. 
A few weeks ago our daughter, who is in her last semester of college, found out she was going to have to have a lump removed. When she met with the surgeon, he assured her it would be an outpatient surgery and that she really just needed someone to drive her home because of the anesthesia. I still wanted to go to be with her and to help out after the surgery. But Next Step thought we should let her decide if she wanted me to come or just keep on hiking. Grammy, ignoring her own serious health concerns, said that she and Granddad would go. And I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that she would have done everything in her power to get there if we would have let her. She is one of the most giving people I know. But she had an amazing example, my Mamaw Rogers!!! Next Step’s sister, Lisa, also volunteered to go, except that she was going to be in Texas hanging out with our niece while his other sister is on vacation. Lisa is another one of those people that would do anything for you! In the meantime, I was talking to our son and his precious wife about it and without hesitation, she asked if she could go to help out instead. She and our daughter are the same age and she thought it would be a great opportunity for them to get some time to spend together. I decided to leave it up to our daughter because I’ve ALWAYS been there!!! Even though our kids both live far away they have both always known that if they need me, I will be there. Our daughter thought that it would be great for her to come so that I could continue with our hike since we are trying to finish by Labor Day. I agreed, but it was hard! Ever since we had kids, Next Step had been our main financial support and I’ve been the main domestic support. Taking care of our family is the thing I love most!!! But still, I thought this was the best decision and I was so proud of our daughter for being so brave and so thankful for our daughter-in-law for stepping in for me! But today, I was questioning my decision. My heart was just aching thinking that I should be there. 
When I decided to hike the AT with Next Step I never thought that the physical part would be a problem. I knew it would test me (and believe me, it’s been way tougher than I ever imagined! I never pictured myself hiking through waist high snow drifts or ALL DAY in a freezing rain/sleet storm, and hiking 17 miles, while climbing almost 6000 feet on a day when the temperatures were in the upper 80 degree range—YOWSA!). But I always thought the biggest struggle would be being unavailable for my family for SIX MONTHS!! That’s just not how I operate. (And I get as much joy from knowing that I am there when they need me!!) I’m not looking for more attendees to my pity party, I am just trying to “keep it real” as to all the things you go through when you’re thru hiking the trail. So today as we were summiting our second big climb of the day, I had my first good cry of the trip. I’m not a very emotional person, but it was all just suddenly overwhelming! All I could think of was that I just needed to get out of the woods and get back to civilization where I belong!!! Poor Next Step didn’t know what was going on. One minute I’m sweating and groaning as I climbed up the mountain and the next minute I’m bawling like a baby! He just let me get it all out and then reminded me what the surgeon had said and that our daughter really wanted me to keep doing what I was doing. But he told me that if I wasn’t going to be okay with it that we’d get me on a plane tomorrow. He truly is the best!!! He suggested I reach out to our daughter to just make sure she was really okay with me not coming. I did, and once again, she told me that she was in good hands and she knew I would be there in a heartbeat if there were any complications...she was just proud of me and to keep on hiking. I’m so glad that at least one of us was being mature about the whole thing! So I pulled myself together and kept on hiking! It was honestly just a physically and mentally draining day. One reason we started our thru hike in February, was to put off having to hike in temperatures like we experienced today for as long as possible. It’s bad enough to just be outside doing nothing when it’s 90 degrees. But it adds whole new dimension when you add climbing mountains to that equation. We stopped for lunch around 11:30 and enjoyed our Italian subs we had gotten at Scotto’s after our supper there last night. We finally reached the top of Bluff Mountain but were running out of water. We realized we were going to have to stop in Punchbowl Shelter to filter water even though the shelter was .2 miles downhill off the trail. So while we were there we took off our shoes and rested our feet while we also had a snack. It’s a good thing we stopped, because we ended up having several more uphill climbs before we reached the spring where we had planned to get our last water of the day and still had to find  a place to camp. The guide had mentioned that there were tent sites .2 miles south before Reservoir Road, but we never saw them. But we did see the 800 mile mark for our journey right before we got to the road. We crossed over and started uphill again (are you kidding me?!?! Haven’t we climbed enough for one day!!) and hiked on about another mile before Next Step spotted the perfect place to set up camp. We could hear thunder in the distance so we thought we better get the tent up before we did our stretching and hiker chores. Fortunately, it only sprinkled for a minute. We didn’t get to eat until about 8:30, our latest supper yet. We have an early start tomorrow so that we can catch a 2:00 shuttle into Buena Vista for lunch and resupply. I’m thinking it’s not going to take either of us very long to get to sleep tonight. 
Some of those following our journal have commented that we make it sound easy. Next Step says that it’s never easy, but it’s always worth it. For now, that’s still the case, but if that changes, I’ll re-look at our plan and make sure this is where I’m supposed to be. In the meantime, I’ll just keep heading north.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590638,"It was 7:00 when we hit the trail. The air was warm and thick and it didn’t take long to work up a sweat. Once again we started the day below 1,000’ and worked our way up to over 4,000’. From our campsite the trail meandered through the forest just above the Lynchburg Reservoir. It then continued alongside the Brown Mountain Creek. Although the trail was pretty level for the first few miles, the bulk of the morning hike was spent leaning into another big climb. This time the beast was named Big Bald. Oddly enough Big Bald is actually not a bald. On the other hand, it’s neighbor, Cole Mountain, is a Bald. It was a long, slow, hot slog up Big Bald. These steep climbs on warm days are seemingly a daily occurrence of late. The thermometer hanging off of WW’s pack read 90 degrees at 11:00. But, we just put one foot in front of the other, sipped our water and “Skittled"" our way to the top of Big Bald and then Cope Mountain. Since the weather has warmed, hazy skies have limited the views and photo opportunities from the high vistas (like the one of Big Bald). But, the open space found on the balds offer uniquely beautiful close-up scenery.  Cole Mountain did not disappoint. 
For the past few days we have been leapfrogging the trail with Snow Angel and Espresso & Clover. We also saw Sherpa at a shelter yesterday. He started his hike on 23 February and the last time we had seen him was in early March at the Sassafras Shelter.  The trail continues to bring us in and out of contact with other hikers.
We reached Hog Camp Gap (USFS 48) at 1:30 sharp. I had arranged for a shuttle at that place and time. Our driver, Oma, co-Proprietor of Three Springs Shuttles, took us to the little town of Buena Vista. She dropped us at Lewis Grocery. We ordered a cheeseburger from the small deli, but were unable to find much in the way of resupply. So we walked about a mile to the Family Dollar to check out their selection. On the way to the Family Dollar we stopped by the Ice Slice for some rolled ice cream—BRAIN FREEZE! 
After grabbing a few items from the store we walked a little further to a Subway to get dinner to go. Our daughter had read Which Way's journal entry from yesterday and called to give Mom a pep talk. I think it must have helped, as her mental mindset swung back to the positive side. By the way, Which Way’s  feet have been doing much better since she picked up her new shoes. Now if we can just get some relief from the heat.
Oma picked us up at Subway at 5:15 p.m. and we were hiking again by six o’clock. Lately, it seems that the last couple of miles have been the best hiking in terms of conditions of the trail. Today was the no different. We hiked up and over Tar Jacket Ridge before arriving at Salt Log Gap, where we found a place to tent a hundred yards or so after crossing another Forest Service Road. I believe prayers are being answered, as we hiked in a pocket of calm air, while severe storms raged all around us. The rain and wind remained at bay as we wrapped up a hot, but good day on the AT.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590756,"Finally, a little relief from the heat. After over a week of larger climbs under a hot sun, today we had a few moderate ascents, cloudy skies, and cooler temperatures. 
We started hiking a little before 7:00 with the intent of making it 17 miles to VA Route 56 by 3:00. We wanted to be off the trail on Thursday so that we could be in contact with our daughter who was having surgery. Originally, I thought that we would already be at Rockfish Gap, with easy access to Waynesboro where we were going to take a planned zero day. However, we realized a few days back that we would fall short by about 30 trail miles (kind of in no-man's land). So, I put a note on the end of one of our posts asking if any readers living nearby were able and willing to help get us to Waynesboro from the not-so-convenient spot where the A.T. Intersected VA 56. It wasn’t long before I got a response from a faithful reader of our journal, David, letting me know that he and his friend, Jim, had us covered. 
Which Way pulled out of camp a few minutes before me and it was about two miles, and not until she stopped to stretch, before I could catch her. This was the story of our day. Later, when I stopped to post the Day 81 journal entry, it took me four miles to catch up. When I made a final detour down to the Priest Shelter to sign the confessional (log book that is), it took me a couple of miles to catch her. On each of those occasions I was moving quickly with a pack lightened from having only snacks to get me through the day. But, each time that I finally caught up to Which Way (a.k.a Barn Sniffer), she was moving at warp speed. At one point, I passed by Snow Angel while trying to make a run for Which  Way. She was the only NOBO we would see on the trail all day.
Anyway, the light rain started to fall shortly after we started hiking and continued on and off throughout the morning. We welcomed the cloudy skies and cool splash of raindrops hitting us as we navigated our way over mostly easy terrain. The elevation for the first 12 miles of the hike stayed between 3,500’ and 4,000’, meaning that there were no climbs over 500’ - what a nice change of pace. After hitting the summit of the cloud-covered Priest Mountain, the trail descended 3,000’ over the final four miles of our hike. The rain also steadily picked up from a sprinkle to a soaking rain as we worked our way down. At first, the path down was rocky and a little technical in spots, but about a mile into the descent, the grade eased and the terrain got much better. With a full canopy and lush ground cover, it was like walking through a rain forest. The Rhododendrons, Flame Azaleas and Spiderworts all popped with color in the moist underbrush. Much of the Mountain Laurel were also laden with 100's of small teacup shaped white flowers.  Some of the Mayapple flowers have grown so large that their stems can no longer hold them upright. 
We emerged soaking wet from the forest at the VA 56 parking area at 2:45 p.m. Our trail angels were already there when we arrived. They had both signed our journal guestbook in the past and it was neat to meet them in person. When we arrived, Dave had fruit, snacks, and soft drinks for us. He was also leaving a cache behind for other thru hikers. Dave had a nice clean car, but did not seem the least bit concerned about two dirty hikers with wet gear piling into his vehicle. Both gentlemen were extremely friendly, exceptionally accommodating and easy to talk to. They bantered back and forth with each other, and before long, with me. I was right at home.
As if it wasn’t enough to pick us up in the middle of nowhere and drive us 35 minutes (sometimes over gravel roads) to Waynesboro, the two of them eagerly made three stops for us. The first stop was at the post office, where we had a couple of packages to pick up. One of the boxes was a care package sent to us from an Army officer I served with during a deployment. It contained some snacks and some blister aid items for Which Way. Thank you Christopher!
The next stop was, Stanimal’s 328 Hostel in Waynesboro (he also owned a satellite hostel we stayed at in Glasgow). WW would stay at the hostel to do a load of laundry and shower while I made one final stop. First, I ran some snacks and some “hiker clothes” (some hostels keep some loaner garments on hand for hikers to wear around town), both compliments of Dave, into the hostel. While inside, I grabbed  a pair of shorts and a t-shirt that fit me and left my dirty stuff behind for WW to add to the laundry. 
Dave and Jim then drove me to the Enterprise rental car agency located another mile or so away. This may require some explaining, as we called an audible on our plans. We knew that at some point in the hike we would have to make a quick sprint to Washington, DC so that I could get a Retiree ID Card and we could pick up our 90-day refill of medications. We originally thought that we would make the trip from Front Royal or Harper's Ferry, but with the way things were lining up, neither of those options were looking feasible. Also, the forecast is calling for very heavy rain and thunderstorms on Thursday and Friday, so we decided to take care of it all now. Dave and Jim waited around to make sure I had secured the rental vehicle before departing. Of course, they would not accept any cash for their troubles. I could tell that  being able to help us out was enough reward for them. I can not thank Dave and Jim enough for delivering BIG TIME trail magic when we needed it the most. You two are the best!!!
The day got better when the Enterprise rep offered me a free upgrade from the economy-size car to a brand new Chevy Tahoe. We would be riding to DC in style. First, I stopped by the hostel for a quick shower. While our clothes were drying, Which Way and I hustled down the street to a local establishment called Jakes, where we scarfed down a really delicious burger.
With our bodies and clothes now clean and bellies full, we were ready to go. After shuttling a couple of hikers to a local AYCE Chinese Buffet, we hit the I-64, headed to DC. I must say, that it felt a little weird driving down the interstate at 65 mph after moving along at a relative snail's pace for the past 3 months. As we passed over the mountains at Rockfish Gap, it was pouring rain. We were happy not to be out in it. Fast forward 2 hours...we took a pit stop in Manassas, VA, where we swung by the church where we were members before hitting the trail. We arrived about half-way through the Wednesday evening Bible study and waited in the foyer for classes to end. It was great to see many of our good friends. Many of them had been following our journal and were very surprised to see us there. It was a neat surprise. After lots of hugs and some Q&A, we continued our trip to DC. 
We arrived at my cousin Bill’s place in Old Town Alexandria a little before 10:00 p.m. Bill had brownies and ice cream ready when we walked through the door. Death by chocolate—Perfect! Bill works for the Department of Interior and is active in the great outdoors. He has a great appreciation for the journey we are on. We were awake until actual midnight catching up. 
What a day!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590977,"The past two days were all about being available for our daughter and taking care of some unfinished Army business. It is an uneasy feeling to be removed from the trail in time and distance. But we had a productive trip and some much needed rest. The best part is that we were able to catch up with some family and friends. 
Cousin Bill fixed up some delicious omelettes to get our day started on Thursday. We eventually made our way to REI, to exchange Which Way’s hiking poles and my damaged headlamp. We also picked up a replacement filter. Our favorite REI rep, Shay (aka Sassy) greeted us with a big hug as soon as we walked in the door. Sassy finished about 600 miles of the A.T. in 2015, but had to come off after breaking her arm on a fall. She returned in 2016 to finish the whole thing. She now has her eyes set on a couple of trails in Europe and eventually the PCT. We met Sassy in 2015 when she was conducting an AT planning class.
We spent the rest of Thursday afternoon running a few errands before making it to some friend's house in Woodbridge, where we spent the night. Some other friends joined us at a Mexican Restaurant, where we shared good food and better company. Michael, Amy, Chris, Alisha, Josh and Amy, Jon and Rachel—it was great to see you all and your kids!
After Which Way took the cereal box away from me Friday morning we packed up the Tahoe and said so long to our host, Amy. From there we went to Fort Belvoir to tighten  a few loose ends. Our last stop was at the ID card facility. Unfortunately, the line was out the door and we didn’t have enough time to wait around. I called Carlisle Barracks, PA, an Army Post we will pass in 2-3 weeks, to confirm that they could assist, and we started our way back to Waynesboro. It rained hard the whole way back. I felt for all of the hikers out in the mess. The rain is forecast to continue for several days, so we will not miss out on all the fun.
After returning to Waynesboro, we took care of some resupply and mailed some packages (bounce boxes) forward to Harper's Ferry, WV and Boiling Springs, PA. After returning the Tahoe, we realized we had time for a movie (one of Which Way's favorite things to do). We were able to hitch a ride with some local trail angels to and from the theater. It has been a good couple of days, but the trail is calling our name and Katahdin is not in Waynesboro. Must keep moving! 
The primary reason we got off the trail for a couple of days was to be available for our daughter during her surgery. Thank you for all of the prayers lifted up on her behalf and for the words of encouragement many of you left on our guestbook. I am happy to report that the prayers have been answered. Her surgery went well, the medical issue is behind her, and she is recovering just fine. Thank you, thank you, thank you...!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591109,"Dave and his wife Claudia gave us a lift back to the VA 56 trailhead. The lovely couple has been married for over 50 years and have settled in Waynesboro as a retirement community. In route to the trail we dropped by Weasie's Kitchen for breakfast. 
We arrived at the trail head at 9:00. It was raining when Dave picked us up on Wednesday and it was raining when he dropped us back off. How fitting.
We were both a little sluggish as we began hiking. The first 6 miles featured a 3,000’ ascent to Three Ridges. The trail was considerably rocky in places, making the climb slow and tedious. All of the rain over the past few days created additional challenges. First, the rocks were wet and very slippery. Next, the trail had turned into a stream bed in several places and water gushed over and around the rocks. In some places you could hear the roar of underground streams racing under our feet. Finally, the mountain streams were swollen to the max, making it more difficult to cross. 
Early in the hike, as I had my head down grinding my way up a steep part of the trail, I looked up to see a deer standing directly in the path. The beautiful deer stood tall, with his ears perked up, and peered down at us through the fog. I snapped a picture as he posed for us, but when I took a step closer, he disappeared into the thick forest in a single effortless leap. 
A bit further we came to Harpe'rs Creek, which was flowing in a torrent just above and below the trail. The water was too high to attempt a rock hopping across the creek. Besides, one slip and we would be washed down the mountain in the violently gushing water. We considered going back to the Mau-har Trail, a scenic blue-blazed trail that bypasses Three Ridges. After a quick check on Guthook, it was apparent that it would contain plenty of challenging stream crossings of its own. The water in Harper’s Creek was pooled up on one side of the trail, so we opted to take off our hiking shoes and wade through the frigid water. The only other NOBO we would see all day crossed just ahead of us. We also met a group of day hikers who were crossing from the opposite direction. Eventually everyone was safely across and we put our hiking shoes back on. 
We stopped for lunch at Chimney Rock, an intermittent peak about a mile from Three Ridges. Normally there would have been a view from here and several other places along the way, but not today. We were hiking in the clouds. I took a picture from Hanging Rock for demonstration purposes. 
About a mile after cresting the top, we came to the empty Maupin Field Shelter, where we stopped to filter drinking water. After a few more ups and downs we came to Reeds Gap. The trail once again crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway here, passing along an open meadow for a piece. The elevation profile was generally flat here, but that did not tell the whole story. The trail was cut along the side of a mountain and the going became considerably slow due to water and rocks on the trail. Once again we were aqua blazing (a term normally reserved for rafting part of an AT journey). To make matters worse, most of the rocks were of the ultra-smooth variety, making them nearly impossible to walk on without slipping. When we started the day, we had about a 30 mile hike to Rockfish Gap. We had hoped to get 16–18 of those miles behind us today, making for a shorter hiking day tomorrow, when we need to get back to Waynesboro for resupply. We learned a long time ago to take what the trail gives us and today it gave us a lot of steep, wet, and slippery terrain. 
Around 6:00 p.m. we realized we would probably not even make it halfway to Rockfish Gap. But, we still needed to find a place to pitch our tent along this cut. Just as you take what the A.T. gives you, the A.T. also provides. We took a side trail to an overlook (Rock Point) and found a flat spot adjacent to the rock outcropping to pitch our tent. The trail also provided us with just enough clearing to get a view with our dinner. 
We were safe and dry in our tent by dark. Then the rain, lightning, and wind came. What a day!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591244,"After some pretty heavy rain last night, we were happy to wake up to a dry tent. The wind took care of the water on the fly and the rocks beneath the tent kept the footprint pretty dry. It was also nice to wake up to sunny skies. We enjoyed a nice view with our breakfast on Rock Point and were hiking by 7:00.
Picking up right where we left off yesterday, we plodded our way over and around slippery rocks for the first couple of miles. The trail was still under water in places and it didn’t take long for us to give up on keeping our feet dry. That said, we at least enjoyed some great views today, including a scenic early morning walk along Cedar Cliffs. 
Usually Which Way is out front, but I took the lead early this morning in hopes of sneaking up on some wildlife. It didn’t take long before we had our first sighting. As we approached the Blue Ridge Parkway at Dripping Rock, I heard a thump thump sound and the a screech. When we reached the BRP, there was were repeated f-bombs being dropped, reminding me of a one-tuned song bird. Then I spotted three young yahoos—wildlife—parked on the side of the trail getting ready for a hike. Perhaps the hike will expand their horizons and their vocabulary. 
The only notable climb of the day was over Humpback Mountain. It was in our review mirror by 10:00, but not before we caught a great view of the area surrounding the Wintergreen Resort. 
The remainder of the hike consisted of more splishing and splashing over water covered trail and a wade through Mill Creek. However, the trail surface improved over the course of the hike. Passing by an old family cemetery and cabin ruins kept it interesting.
We did not see a single NOBO all day. However, we did pass “Jumpmaster” and “Grins a Little” coming from the opposite direction. We had not seen them since Tray Mountain, GA. I did not recognize who it was until we were past them and WW said something about it. I did notice that his chest strap was still riding high and she just grinned when I said hello. 
The hike ended at Rockfish Gap, where we were greeted by a mother (Cindy) and daughter (Marney) trail angel team. They were handing out refreshments. Marney has aspirations of hiking the A.T. after she graduates from college. We worked our way across the BRP and US Route 250 to a hot dog stand. No further details needed. A SOBO named Mini Haha and her friend happened to be at the stand with a car. They were kind enough to give us a ride to Waynesboro, where we resupplied and holed up at the Quality Inn for the night. 
After we were all cleaned up, Dave and his lovey wife Claudia came by the hotel to pick us up and take us to dinner. We ate at the Green Leaf. The food was delicious and the company was better. Dave is an avid bike rider and had lots of great stories about his adventures. Dave also insisted on picking up the tab. There is no apparent end to his generosity.
Back at it tomorrow. Rain in the forecast...splish, splash!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591375,"Last night at dinner Dave offered  to give us a ride back to the trail in the morning. Plod Along and Grandma Shorty stayed at the same hotel as us and I knew that they needed a ride as well. So I asked Dave if he minded shuttling them too. He picked the four of us up at 7:00 and we look the short drive back to Rockfish Gap. 
The Blue Ridge Parkway becomes Skyline Drive here and continues through the Shenandoah National Park (SNP). After walking a couple of hundred yards up the road and crossing I-64, the trail exited into the woods and soon came to a spot marking the southern entrance to the SNP. A registration station is located here for hikers to obtain a backcountry camping permit. The A.T. will continue through the SNP for approximately 103 miles. The SNP is divided into three districts and is home to over 500 miles of hiking trails. These trails served as our training ground in the years leading up to our A.T. journey. In a sense, we are back on our home turf.
The trail surface was good for most of the day, with very little standing water. Although we ascended over 4,000’, the grade was reasonable, making the hiking a little easier. However, Which Way was still dealing with a strained back most of the day. After passing over Bears Den Mountain and Calf Mountain it was time to stop for water and eat lunch. Plod Along and Grandma Shorty walked up just as we were finishing lunch. There was one other NOBO hiker getting water at the same spring. He was from the Harper's Ferry (about 150 trail miles north) and indicated that he may end his hike there. These were the only other NOBOs we saw all day. 
The trail continued with moderate ups and downs the rest of the day, intersecting with familiar trails like Riprap and Wildcat Ridge along the way. 
With daylight waning and rain threatening to move in soon, we decided to look for a stealth site in the vicinity of Black Rock Gap. With the help of comments left on the Guthook App, we were able to find a nice spot next to a stream about 150 yards down  the Moorman River Road. 
Another tent was already pitched there, but  there was plenty of room for two. The other tent belonged to Chewy, a 2017 thru hiker. 
We cooked up some yummy Mac-n-cheese for dinner and hit the tent at dusk. The rain did not start until later in the night.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591552,"With the wet tent all packed up by 6:30, we quietly slipped out of our shared tent site. Not wanting to disturb our still sleeping neighbor, we walked back up the fire road to Blackrock Gap, where we cooked our breakfast. From there it was a gentle climb to Blackrock Mountain. Midway through the ascent we passed the blue blaze trail leading to Blackrock Hut. In the SNP,  shelters are referred to as huts. This was the first hut Which Way and I slept in when we were doing a training hike in 2015. It was a memorable hike. After a 13 mile day that included a climb up and over Tray Mountain and then a steep climb up to the A.T., Which Way was ready to set the tent up in the middle of the trail. She certainly has come a long way since then. 
The entire swath of trail we hiked this morning was familiar territory as it was part of several circuit hikes we did over the past few years. Plus, Blackrock Mtn. is a spot we have brought many visitors to experience because of its easy access and worthy views. There were no views this morning though, as the area was still socked in with cloud cover. 
The conditions seemed optimal for a bear sighting this morning. No such luck though. However, I was able to get a rabbit and a deer to strike a pose.
By 11:00 we had reached the Loft Mountain Campground, which was in close proximity to the trail. We popped in the Camp Store which had everything we needed for resupply. From there we made our way to the Loft Mountain Wayside for lunch—Pulled Pork Sandwiches, Chili Dogs, Fries and a double dip of Blackberry Ice Cream. BoBo, a hiker we met yesterday, joined us for lunch.  
Shortly after getting back on the trail we crossed the swollen Ivy Creek, where we stopped to filter water. From there we climbed a little to a spot providing a view. We could see storm clouds brewing to our west. At the same time, low clouds were stacked up along the east slide of the ridge and wisps were carried from over the top in a down draft. Then we heard a rumble of thunder.  A quick look at the radar confirmed that storms were headed our way. It was still 2.5 miles to the next shelter. We didn't  make it on time. After racing over the top and down the other side a few hundred feet in elevation, the trail climbed back up and over another hill. This one was still scarred from a recent wildfire, leaving it somewhat exposed. The storm was almost on us now as the wind picked up and drops of rain were starting to fall. Just as we started down and hit the wood line the skies opened up. The hard cold rain soaked through our clothes in an instant. Meanwhile, the lightning and thunder drew closer. As we walked through a green tunnel of medium sized trees I told Which Way to get ready because the next lightning strike would be on top of us. Less than 30 seconds later, a bolt exploded on the trail less than a 100 yards in front of us. I was walking behind Which Way and she appeared to jump out of her shoes at the instantaneous flash-bang. Jumping jack flash! The storm was moving fast and the next lightning strike was to the east. However, it was still raining when we walked into Pinefield Hut. BoBo, a German thru hiker named Scavenger, and an overnight hiker were all in the shelter and were nice and dry when we arrived. It was close to 4:00 p.m. by now and they were staying put for the night. Which Way and I shortly ventured back out in search of the next hut located about 6.5 miles north. The rain stopped soon after we started our climb up Weaver Mountain. By the time we dropped down to Simmons Gap and crossed Skyline Drive the sun was peeking through the clouds and a nice breeze was blowing. We sat on a couple of rocks next to the road, took off our soaked shoes and socks, and let our feet dry as we ate dinner. Our feet were dry by the time we finished the deli sandwiches we picked up back at the camp store. We pulled on some dry socks, put on our damp shoes and continued toward the shelter. 
About a mile after we climbed out of Simmons Gap we hit the 900 mile mark—almost to quadruple digits! There was nothing on the trail to mark the milestone and we didn’t have time to make one. We were hoping to make it to Hightop Hut, but it wasn’t meant to be. A quick look at the radar showed another batch of rain and storms closing in fast, so we found a stealth tenting location about 3 miles short of the shelter. By  8:00 p.m. we were laying in our tent. It was raining again before dark. Good move!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591648,"After the rain stopped last night some drier air moved in and the wind picked up. This allowed our tent to completely dry, making for a good start to the day. In the middle of the night we draped our wet clothes over a line that I had strung between two trees. The result was that we only had to put damp (vs wet) clothes back on this morning; another reason to feel good about the day. The final boost came when we walked out of our stealth site and across the trail, where we caught a great morning view from an open ledge. Now we were ready to hike. Big Meadows Lodge and Campground were about 23 miles up the trail. If all went well, we hoped to make it there, leaving us just under 18 miles to Thornton Gap the next day. The air was cooler, drier and breezier this morning so we had a fighting chance of making it.
The first order of business was a long ascent up Hightop Mountain, which offered an amazing view at the summit. A hiker named Tang was also enjoying the view. He was hiking with Josh, who has a really cool dog named Murdock. Anyway, Tang has not seen any bears yet and was anxious that he would miss out. I told him that we hadn’t seen one yet either, but that we done a lot of hiking in the SNP and felt that he had an excellent chance of seeing one. I added that it would probably happen when he least expected it, like while crossing Skyline drive. Not long after Which Way and I parted ways and started down the mountain, there it was, at mile 907.  The hairy beast was on the trail and he was headed directly towards us! Now all of the other bears we had seen in these parts were of the black variety, but this one was brown. What, a grizzly in the SNP?!?! We slowed, but the animal kept huffing up the hill in our direction. I told Which Way to stay behind me. When it got a little closer I noticed something really odd about this fury creature. It had on a pair of cammo shorts and a day pack! We stood to the side as the overly tanned, extra hairy, and bare (or is it bear) chested man passed us by. WW commented that that was another unfortunate image would not soon escape her mind.
Swift Run Gap sits to the north of Hightop, where Skyline Drive intersects with U.S. Hwy 33, marking the line between the South and Central District of the SNP. Just as we came out of the woods to cross Skyline Drive and walk over US 33, I looked to my right. For real this time, a big mama bear and her two newborn cubs were about 200 yards up the road, meandering their way in our direction. I took a picture and was hoping they would venture closer so that I could get a better picture and a video. Unfortunately, a vehicle came past me and drove right up to the three bears, causing the mama to usher her cubs into the woods. There was yet another bear sighting at the end of the hike. This time it was a small bear casually crossing the path. I figured this was its first year on its own, but thought it best to hang back for a moment to make sure mama  wasn’t close by. The best shot I could get was the “rear” view. Even though, it was definitely better than the full frontal view of the “grizzly.” The bears were not the only wildlife to be seen today. The deer, rabbits, squirrels, chipmunks, and birds all made appearances at various points along the way. One deer casually crossed the trail just 15 yards ahead. I didn’t have time to get my camera out before it sauntered into the woods, so I whistled to see if it would stop. She did and I got my picture. 
On a mission to make it to Big Meadows before dark, there was not much time to linger along the trail, much of which we had previously hiked. The path went right by the Lewis Mountain Campground. It was so tempting to stop for a cold sandwich or to try to yogi a hotdog from a camper...must keep moving! For the most part the hiking was very easy. One 2-3 mile stretch was so soft and sloping gently downward that I likened it to walking on a moving sidewalk. That said, there was another stretch that had about 4” of water and mud that couldn’t be avoided. I took one misstep that led to my entire shoe being submerged in muck. Even though I tried walking through some clear running water in an attempt to clean my shoes, my feet were still covered in mud when I removed my shoes that night. One other rough patch came while hiking through a short stretch of rocks below Bearfence Mountain. A blue blaze trail connects with the A.T. here to make a short loop that includes a really cool rock scramble up and over the cliffs above Bearfence.  There is also a great panoramic view at the top. With easy access from Skyline Drive, the Bearfence Loop was always one of our favorites to take guests and friends. No time for that today though. Gotta keep moving.
We had a d decision to make at Big Meadows—campground or lodge? I deferred to Which Way to decide. Of course, we ended up in the lodge.  Fortunately there was enough time to shower up before dinner. Washing off the filth that has accumulated on our bodies since Waynesboro took more than a minute. Still, we were sitting at the Big Meadows Restaurant before sunset. The bbq rib dinner and Blackberry desserts  (Ice Cream Pie for me and Ice Cream Sundae for Which Way) were a perfect ending to a long day of hiking.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591733,"Well today we are celebrating our 3 month anniversary on the trail! YOWSA! That just seems so crazy that we have been hiking that long! We started our day with a big breakfast at the Big Meadows Lodge. We were standing in line when the dining room opened at 7:30  so we could try to be back on the trail as close to 8:00 as possible. It ended up being around 8:15, so that meant we would just have to hike a little faster. We had already arranged a shuttle pick up between 5:00 and 5:30 p.m.  and we had 17.6 miles between us and our ride into Luray. Today would be another walk down memory lane. As Next Step has mentioned, we were last stationed in DC and for the last two and a half years, we spent ALOT of time in the Shenandoah National Park.  We were also fortunate to have lots of guests over that time and one of our favorite things to do with them was to take them hiking in the SNP. Almost all of today’s hike included parts of the trail where we had spent time entertaining our guests. It reminded us of taking Tracy and Trista,from Indianapolis, to the Stoneman Trail. It was their first time to hike in the SNP and later on that day we saw a bear that refused to get off the trail. They LOVED it! We were reminded of hiking with Bryson and Leah Read, from Austin, and sitting on a rock on one of the views and just having a feeling of pure peace. We hiked past Black Rock where we had taken my Aunt Sue and Uncle Frank last Fall. We did several hikes with them that day and were reminded of all our laughs and the goofy pictures we had taken! 
Next Step had stopped for a picture at one of the views today (of which there were MANY!!) and Snow Angel came up to also enjoy the view. We were happy to see her again. She and I chitchatted the next few miles while we hiked to the Skyland Lodge for lunch. Those miles went by in a flash! We enjoyed overpriced club sandwiches and fries. But sadly, I would have probably paid double if they had asked. It hit the spot and would give us the fuel we needed to hike the remaining 10 miles to Thornton Gap. On our way we hit the trail to the Pinnacles and finally Mary’s Rock. This reminded us of the fun day we spent hiking with David, Becky and Carlin Green and Carlin’s girlfriend, Jackie. I remember how the wind was blowing so hard that day we could barely eat our lunch! There were lots more hikes and lots more friends that joined us on hikes in the SNP, but those didn’t include any time on the AT. But it brought back all of those memories as well. Especially the time we took “Fearless Chris” and his wife Alisha on a hike. Chris scared the bajeevers out of me, going off trail and climbing on rocks!! He also loved to jump out from behind trees and growl to try and scare Alisha and me. I decided I would get him back, so I ran ahead and hid behind a tree. When I jumped out, I “growled” really loud, except when it came out, it sounded more like a screech. Seriously, it had sounded so much scarier in my head!! They said I reminded them more of a pink panther than a bear! That was such a great day and the start of an AMAZING friendship. 
We made it to our pick up spot at 5:20 and Allison from the Open Arms Hostel was patiently waiting for us. She drove us into Luray and gave us a quick tour on where to find a grocery store and supper - very important information for thru hikers! Lol We got checked into our motel and got showers. Then we walked back to the pizzeria for supper. Shocker! Now just to get back and get ready for an EXCITING day tomorrow!! Our son and his wife are headed this way to spend Memorial Day weekend with us. I can hardly stand the wait!! Tomorrow, Next Step will represent us on the trail and I am taking the kiddos to Luray Caverns. We’ve hiked tomorrow’s trail more than once, so I thought it would be fine to miss out this time. But Next Step will be busting miles to try and finish up the SNP so that we can be set up to do an overnighter with the family Sunday night. He’ll get a much deserved zero on Saturday. And we’ll be making memories all weekend for me to think about the rest of our hike! I am thinking it’s just what I need to chase away the Virginia Blues!!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591856,"With our son and his wife coming to town today, my goal was to get as much of the SNP completed as I could, making things logistically easier for when we return to the trail with our kids. If I had enough time, I was hoping to make it 28 miles to VA 522. This would put us completely out of the SNP with very easy access. Since we had already hiked the entire A.T. (and 95% of the other trails) in the Northern District many times over, Which Way was meeting the kids in Luray and taking them on a guided tour of Luray Caverns while I beat feet. A late start, warm day, and bear encounters hindered my progress. Thornton Gap marked the dividing line between the SNP Central and Northern Districts. So when Allison returned me to the trail at 8:00 and I crossed the highway, I was now hiking in the Northern District. I was able to cover six miles in the first two hours. By my math, if I could keep that pace, I should be able to make it to VA 522 by 6:00 p.m. The immediate goal was to get to the Elkwallow Wayside for a burger and shake (because we all know that that is excellent hiker fuel). The Wayside is located a tenth of of a mile off the A.T. about 8.5 miles from Thornton Gap. About a mile before I hit the side trail I crossed a small stream. A second after I crossed the stream I heard a rock overturn just below the trail. Curious, I turned back a few steps to peer down the gully in the direction of the noise. No more than 20 yards below me was a decent size bear. I figured it was turning over rocks in the stream looking for food. I stood still and the bear looked up my way, sticking its brown nose in the air to catch a whiff. The vegetation was pretty thick, the lighting was terrible and she was behind a fallen tree. I raised my I-phone to get a pic anyway, hoping she would raise up a little for a better shot. Just as I took the first picture, two very small (terrier-sized) cubs darted in front of her. Oh snap! I hadn’t noticed them before in the thick vegetation. I figured I should move on. As I walked slowly up the trail, I could see that they were moving parallel below me. About 50 yards later I came to another trail running perpendicular to the AT. I waited there for a minute hoping the sow and her cubs would cross that trail below me for the perfect pic. Being impatient, I slid down the side trail a bit. Oops, I looked over and saw mama bear was pretty close and she was definitely watching me.  I decided it was time to go before she got irritated by my presence. As I approached the side trail to Elkwallow, two adults with their energetic grandsons were headed my way. When I warned them of the bear and her cubs, they told me that there was a year-old cub just up the side trail. I continued cautiously in that direction and sure enough, there was a cute little bear foraging just 10 yards off the trail. But, where was mama?!?! I backed up a little and started talking to the bear. “Where is your mama?” The little fellow just looked at me without a care. I’m glad he was cool with the situation, because I sure was feeling uneasy. Was I about to be pummeled from behind by an angry sow? I nervously took a pic (perhaps my last one) as I backed slowly away. About that time, three other hikers walking on the A.T. (running diagonally away from the side trail I was on) spooked the cub and it darted across the path directly in front of me. Wow!
100 yards later, the path led to the Wayside. It was still early and uncrowded, so I had my burger and shake in no time. I also grabbed a Gatorade for the trail and refilled my water bladder. Oh, and I bought a Double Shot Espresso to stash away in my pack for a late day energy boost. 19 was already there demolishing a burger of his own, so I joined him. He was the only NOBO I would see all day. There was another man at the picnic table with us who was a bit of a regular. He told me that the cub I had just seen was an orphan that actually made it through the winter on his own. 
By the time I was back on the trail, the day had heated up considerably. I pressed on with a full belly and in a full sweat at a pace that was not quite as fast as the morning clip. Passing by side trails like Neighbor Mountain, Jeremy’s Run, Thornton River, Piney Branch, and the Tuscarora  brought back memories of numerous day hikes and shakedown backpacking trips Which Way and I had done in this area over the past three years. It really was a great training ground. 
I caught up with 19 crossing over North Marshall Mountain. Some great views to the west and north from here. It was around 2:30 now and I had enough cell signal here to send Which Way a status text. “ETA VA 522 6:30...ETA Compton Gap 4:45.” Compton Gap (22 miles north of Thornton Gap) would be the last pick-up point inside the SNP.  I didn’t want them to have to hang around waiting for me, so I left the rendezvous point up to her. Obviously I was ready to see the kids, so I was hoping she would decide on Compton Gap. She did. I had crested Compton Peak and was about 5-minutes from the parking area below, when I saw my son walking up the trail in my direction. His wife was right behind him and came running up to meet me. They gave their sweaty dad a big hug and we walked back down to the gap, arriving at 4:45 on the nose.
The first stop was the Mountain Home Cabin Hostel, located just off the trail on VA 522. I took a quick shower and made arrangements with Scott, the co-proprietor, to stay there Sunday night. Scott and his wife Lisa have a great reputation for taking care of hikers. The next stop was an Indian Restaurant in nearby Gainesville. The final stop for the night was at the home of some close friends, the Huddlestons that live Haymarket. They are graciously turning their house into a hiker hostel for the weekend.

It was a blessing to reunite with friends and worship together. My cousin, Bill, drove over from Alexandria to join us. A group of us went out for Mexican food afterward. 
Jon and his daughter, Katie, joined our son and his wife in the hike from Compton Gap down to VA 522 (Mountain Home Cabin). Cousin Bill graciously offered to shuttle all of us back into the SNP. We said our goodbyes to Bill and commenced hiking at 3:30 p.m.The 6 mile hike was almost all downhill, so it didn’t take us long to finish up. It was nice sharing part of our adventure with family and friends. After our friends took off, Which Way, our kids and I did a quick clean up and went into town for supper. The hostel owner had recommended the Blue Wing Frog...sounded interesting. It was a locally owned eatery that did not disappoint! Everything was made in-house, including all the breads. They even made their own ketchup and mayonnaise! We couldn’t pass up a chance for dessert, so when we were all completely stuffed, we headed back to the hostel for a few games before bedtime.

For the first couple of miles the trail skirted a fence that marked the boundary of a nature preserve and biological conservancy used by the Smithsonian National Zoo to breed endangered animals. A few miles into the hike we came to the Jim and Molly Denton Shelter, one of the nicest on the trail. The roomy shelter had a deck extending to the front with a large bench seat. There was also a separate pavilion for the picnic table. How nice! Oh, and there was a field shower too. Finally, a horseshoe pit was set up in front of the shelter. Of course, Patrick and I had to sling the irons before we moved on.
A small section of the trail passed through meadows with chest high grass. About 8 miles into our hike we came to Manassas Gap, where the trail crosses under I-66. This is also where Patrick’s car was parked. Less than 5-miles west of the parking area is a restaurant named the Apple House. We had been here many times before and talked about how we would visit it again when hiking the AT. Well, today was the day. The Apple House serves a good breakfast and lunch, but the specialty is their Apple Cinnamon Donuts, which are served fresh and hot. Delicious!
Patrick and Rachael returned us to the trail a little before 2 p.m. They crossed the trail head bridge leading from the parking area with us and after exchanging some final hugs, they watched us walk up the trail and out of sight. It dawned on me that they had done the same at Springer Mountain. Mom shed a few tears as we walked away. It is always tough to part ways with loved ones. 
The air thickened as we continued on the second half of our hike. Although we were not hiking in rain, the moisture from the fog dampened the vegetation around us. We eventually came to an official tent site in the Thompson Wildlife Management Area. The spot was up a grassy trail, cut through some very thick thorn bushes and vines. It was a song bird haven and they chattered into the night.
We had a great visit with the kids. So glad they were able to visit and even get a small flair of life on the trail. It was hard saying goodbye, but our time together gave us the boost of energy we needed to get us out of Virginia. 
Peace & Blessings!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592341,"Today was packed with  milestones, surprises and some down right tough hiking. We pulled out of our overly damp campsite a little after 7:00. For the first several miles the elevation and terrain were reasonable. However, the trail was overgrown in places with vegetation that was still wet from the heavy mist/dew from the night before. We reached Sky Meadow State Park pretty early in the morning. This was one of the first places that we had hiked when we moved to DC several years ago. From the trail, you could catch glimpses of fog clinging to the Virginia Piedmont.
From Sky Meadows we hiked downhill to Ashby Gap, where we crossed a busy US 50/17. Right before we crossed we came to a big plastic tub labeled “ Trail Magic Thru Hikers Only”. We eagerly opened the tub only to find that it was filled with empty bottles and other garbage. “Oh well, at least I can get rid of my hiker trash,” Which Way remarked. Not a total Trail Magic Fail. 
About seven miles into our hike we entered into the part of the trail known as the Virginia Roller Coaster, the first part of which we had never hiked. We had kind of envisioned an easy path just going up and down moderate size hills. Unfortunately, it was nothing like that! It ended up being 10 climbs and descents over 10 miles averaging about 400 feet each. However, the path was either filled with rocks or mud. Throw in a stream crossing at every gap with 80 degree temperatures and it made for a grueling hike. Up, rocks, down, rocks, mud, stream crossing, mud, up, rocks, down, rocks...you get the picture.
At the top of the second climb (Piney Ridge) we stopped for some pb&j’s to fuel us up for the remaining climbs. We also sat up our wet tent so it could dry while we ate. We were out of water now and planned to filter at the bottom of the hill after lunch. As we were hiking down, we could hear construction equipment in the background. I was hoping they were operating downstream. However, when we reached the creek, it was extremely muddy so we decided to hike on to the next stream. A southbound hiker passed by and said that there was some good trail magic up ahead. We had heard that before so we tried not to get our hopes up only to find that it was already gone. Today was our lucky day! We got to the top of the hill and there were Count and Lavender cooking up hot dogs! They also had chips, soda, watermelon and brownies. Now that’s what I call Trail Magic! It didn’t even matter that we had just eaten our lunch. Two hot dogs, please! The trail angels had thru hiked back in 2015 and were now very passionate about giving back to the trail. We had such a great time chatting with them we didn’t realize how much time had gotten away from us. We still had 5 more climbs to get to our stop for the night and the temps were only getting hotter. We exchanged phone numbers, said our good byes and got back to it.
More of the same rocks, mud, and stream crossings. Just after we had crested the next peak, Buzzard Hill, we hit another major milestone, the 1,000 mile point on the trail! What, no band or welcome committee! Just the numbers 1-0-0-0 next to the trail that another hiker had formed with sticks, rocks and leaves. Already wiped out from some tough hiking, it definitely felt like we had hiked a 1,000 miles to get to that point. No rest for the weary or time to celebrate for that matter. Instead, we snapped our traditional 1000 mile pic and moved on to the next round of hills. 
Around 6:45 we saw the sign pointing up to Bear’s Den Hostel. It is one of the more well-known establishments along the trail and for good reason. It looks like a mini castle on the outside and is a hiker’s dream on the inside. A nice living area when you walk in with a game table and even an old upright piano. It also had a large dining area and kitchen. And most importantly, it was super clean! We got checked in and hit the shower. That always works wonders on a day like today. We got the laundry started before we went up and put in some frozen pizzas for supper. There was fresh cut watermelon on the table. But even better than that, just as we opened up our Ben & Jerry’s pint of ice cream for dessert, the care taker, Glen, brought out piping hot cookies from the oven. We stayed up and chatted with Plod Along and Grandma Shorty well past hiker midnight. We are all headed to Harper’s Ferry tomorrow which will be a big day -the Psychological Halfway Point on the AT! 
Plot twist. Which Way is getting a ride into Charlestown to the Urgent Care from our trail Angels, Count and Lavender. She re-aggravated an old back injury a couple of weeks ago and it’s just keeps getting worse. We're hoping she can get some pain relief, but more importantly, some advice on fixing the problem. I suffered through a couple of years of back pain, so I know it’s no fun, especially carrying a backpack up and down mountains! Praying for good results today! 
Peace & Blessings!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592440,"It has been like waiting for Christmas to get here, but the day finally arrived. That is, the day we put Virginia in our rear view mirror. I was up early this morning getting ready to hike while Which Way fixed me up with a stack of pancakes. It was hard to leave her behind this morning, but she wanted me to keep the train moving while she caught a ride to Charles Town, WV to get her back checked out. A big shout out to Count and Lavender (the trail angels that delivered magic yesterday) for offering to pick Which Way up and get her to the WVU Urgent Care and then to Harper's Ferry. 
I was out the door before 7:00, determined to make it to Harper's Ferry in time to shower and decompress. Finishing our hike after 6:00 p.m. with little time to unwind, is getting old. I still had three miles and the same number of hills remaining on the Virginia Roller Coaster. With fresh legs and cooler temps I knocked them out with relative ease. Within a half mile of departing Bears Den the trail crossed VA 7 at Snickers Gap. It was rush hour (yes, commuters drive all the way to DC from here) and crossing the busy road was like playing hiker Frogger. On the north side of the road is a small parking area. It was here that I met a friend of mine back when he was thru hiking in 2016. Which Way and I did Trail Magic that morning while we waited for our friend to hike his way to us. Then I hiked to Harper's Ferry with him and we brought him back to DC for a Zero. Doing trail magic was so much fun. Talking and hiking with other long distance hikers provided a great opportunity to pick up a few additional tips as we prepared for our own hike.
At mile 1007.4 there was a sign posted that read “VA/WV State Line.” Finally, after six weeks and 544 miles, we made it. It has been a long slow slog, but we have great memories from Virginia. Places like Damascus, Grayson Highlands, Burkes Garden, Dragons Tooth, McAfee Knob, Shenandoah National Park to name a few. Not to mention all of the wonderful people we shared time with on and off the trail.  A big thanks to the U.S. National Parks Service, Forestry Service, Eight Trail Clubs, and 100's of volunteers who maintain the trail in Virginia. Not so fast, the trail actually skirted the VA/WV line for about 10 more miles before finally crossing into West Virginia just before Harper's Ferry. 
Passing by Raven Rock and the Blackburn Center brought back memories from my 2016 mini-hike. Which Way and I have also hiked a good piece of the trail leading into Harper's Ferry on several different day hikes. For most of the morning the trail was gentle and it was cloudy, misty, and somewhat cool. All of these factors contributed to me making good time to the David Lesser Memorial Shelter, where I stopped to eat lunch—leftover pizza. Of note were some lush ferns, blooming Mountain Laurel, and a deer that I watched for a few moments.
A few miles later the trail crossed WV 9 at Keys Gap. Before crossing the road I looked to my right and saw a “Welcome to Virginia” about 20 yards away. About the same distance to my right was a “Welcome to West Virginia” sign. Where did that leave me? The A.T. I guess. After crossing the road, I hit some pretty muddy spots and then rocks, both of which considerably slowed my roll. The rain also began to fall steady, but I didn’t mind. At least not until I had to hike through some tall, wet grass while crossing under some power lines.
The rocks continued to Loudon Heights, where the trail turned down the mountain and headed towards the Shenandoah River. The trail was wet and steep at times, but I still made it quickly to the Shenandoah River Bridge. Which Way and I have walked across this before and talked about how cool it would be to do it on our AT hike. Only, she wasn’t with me today. I still enjoyed the moment, as I crossed the heavily trafficked bridge, watching a dozen rafts float down the swollen river below. From the WV side of the bridge it was a short walk up U.S. 340 to the Quality Inn where Which Way had reserved a room for the night. She had walked down to the road and was waiting to celebrate with me. After a quick shower we headed into Harper's Ferry and the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) HQs.  The trail continues about a half mile from where I crossed the bridge, paralleling just above  Shenandoah St., crossing over Jefferson Rock along the way. It then crosses into the historic town of Harper's Ferry at High Street. Harper's Ferry National Historical Park, has 19th-century buildings, a Civil War Museum and John Brown’s Fort, a key site in an 1859 abolitionist raid. The location where the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers meet, known as The Point, offers views of Maryland and Virginia. The ATC HQs is located about a half mile off the trail, uphill from the historic district.  It is where hikers go to register their progress on the AT. That is one reason that Harper's Ferry is referred to by some as the “psychological halfway point” for NOBOs. We registered as NOBO hikers numbers 441 and 442 to arrive in 2018. Espresso & Clover and Snow Angel had registered earlier the same day. It is tradition for the ATC to take A.T. hikers’ pictures in front of the building and post them in their official record book. We happily obliged. The next time we will register our hike will be at Mount Katahdin in Maine. 
After finishing up at the ATC we walked down the hill to grab some dinner and ice cream. We then walked along Shenandoah Street, working our way back to the hotel. Plod Along and Grandma Shorty were just finishing their hike and entered the hotel lobby a minute after we returned. 
A quick update on Which Way. The doctor said she has inflammation in her mid-back from a prior injury. The doctor prescribed a round of steroids and set WW up for some physical therapy tomorrow. She also strongly recommended that WW rest for 5-7 days. That means no carrying a back pack. So, here’s the plan. Which Way will pick up a rental car tomorrow and will follow me along for several days as I continue the hike. When it makes sense to do so, she might join me (without a pack). I plan on taking a Zero in Boiling Springs, PA. If she is healed, Which Way will resume her hike again then. She can always come back and fill in the gaps later. Please pray that she gets the healing that she needs to continue to Katahdin. We may have 4 states and 1K miles in the books, but there is still a lot of hiking to do. That makes us the lucky ones. 
Peace & Blessings

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592560,"It was drizzling when I walked out of the Quality Inn at 7:45. I reconnected with the A.T. at the Shenandoah River Bridge and followed the trail back to High Street, passing Jefferson Rock and other sites along the way. I stood for a moment at the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers, thinking about the historical significance of this small town and letting the realization sink in that we had hiked over a 1,000 miles to get this point. Crossing the Potomac, into Maryland, on the Byron Memorial Foot Bridge really gave me the sensation that we were entering a new phase of our hike. I wished Which Way was with me to take it in, as she earned it. She also earned what came next, a three mile stroll along the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O) Canal Tow Path. The C&O path runs from Cumberland, MD, 184.5 miles along the Potomac River, to Washington, DC. It was designed to open up a transportation mode between the east coast and the wealth of resources coming out of the western frontier. It operated for about 100 years before being rendered obsolete by the invention of the steam engine and ensuing rail road. Ironically, a freight train came roaring through the tunnel on the far side of the river and passed me by as I crossed the bridge. It was the first of four trains that passed as I walked down the flat gravel path. 
From the C&O, the trail crossed under US 340 and climbed about 1,000 feet over two miles to the Weverton Cliffs. It was an easy climb on an easy hiking day. While there were some rocks, they were not of the annoying variety. That meant that I could generally pick a line through the scattered (not so pointy) rocks without hindering my stride too much. If it had not been for patches of water and mud, the hike would have been classified as a piece of cake.
Once on top, the trail followed a ridge for about five muddy miles to Gathland State Park. This was the halfway point in my hike and I arrived right at noon. At the center of the  scenic park were restrooms with a covered side porch and bench - a perfect spot for lunch. I took off my shoes and used an adjacent spigot to rinse off my muddy feet and socks. Then I used the restroom sink to wash my hands and face. Now I was ready to sit and enjoy my PB&J Bagels. There was even a trash can in the restroom where I could offload my garbage. What a great spot! Just as I was leaving another NOBO named Donut raced around the corner with the same look of satisfaction I had when I arrived. I said, “I’m taking off, the spot is all yours.” I told him my name and that I was hiking with Which Way. When I mentioned her name he said, “Which Way and Next Step, I was following your trail journal before I started my hike.” Donut started his hike on 28 March and was making good time. I told him about  Which Way’s injury, that she was following me in a rental vehicle as she healed, and to reach out if he needed anything. 
The second half of the hike was even easier than the first, mainly because there was less mud to deal with. I hiked at a pretty good clip to White Rock Cliff, where I stopped for a snack and to check the weather. Storms were slowly moving in my direction. There was a SOBO section hiker at the spot and we talked for a few minutes. Just as I was walking off, Donut came racing up and caught my attention. He said that he was thinking about my offer for help and that he could really use some Deet (bug spray). I told him I would reach out to Which Way and see if she could grab a can for him. I told him I was meeting her at the Washington Monument State Park, about 5.5 miles up the trail. We hiked a couple of miles together before he stopped for a short break. He caught back up to me at Reno Monument Road, where I had stopped to call WW and check out some Civil War Historical Markers. I told him that she would have some Deet for him. I also checked the radar and saw the storms were closing fast. We covered the next two miles in warp speed, hitting the parking area where WW was waiting just before the storm hit. I had also told her about my hiking partners trail name, so she had a couple of donuts in her hand when he walked up. Again, there was a spigot handy, so I washed my muddy legs, feet, and shoes before jumping in the car. There was also a very nice hiker day shelter where Donut took refuge from the storm, while no doubt enjoying his cream-filled treats.
WW and I ended up getting a room at the Super 8 in Hagerstown. It was west and a little north of where she picked me up, so we could stay for two nights if we chose to. Also, the Physical Therapist wanted to see her again on Friday and Charles Town was still pretty close by. WW was a little sore from her session today, but really liked the treatment she was getting. I just hate that she is missing some easy hiking. She would have enjoyed it. This too shall pass.
Peace & Blessings!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592683,"It was a short walk from the parking lot up to the Washington Monument.  There were three other A.T. hikers between the parking lot and the monument. That is the most I have seen along the trail in awhile. The day was off to a good start with a smooth path, sunny skies, and a slight breeze. However, the temperature rose pretty quickly, making even the shortest climb more difficult.
About two miles into the hike the trail crossed over I-70 on a footbridge. We have driven under that same footbridge dozens of times in the past. When we did I would always comment to Which Way that one day we would be walking over that bridge. The first 8 miles of the hike continued to be pretty easy. Then came the rocks. It was as though all the rocks in Maryland had been placed in this half mile stretch of the trail. My feet were tired and sore inside my already worn out hiking shoes. Plus, it just breaks your rhythm when you have to gingerly work your way through a wet, jagged, and uneven pile of rocks. 
The trail continued past Annapolis Rocks downhill to Black Rock Creek. I picked up an empty water bottle on the trail on my way down to the creek. When I arrived I found its owner, who had stopped to filter water. I refilled my own water and stopped for lunch at the same spot. 
Not long after lunch the trail crosses through an open field. Thankfully the grass had been mowed along the trail, as it was over waist high in the rest of field. I ran into a ridge runner coming from the opposite direction and stopped to talk with him for a second. He said the trail ahead of me was a taste of Pennsylvania. A good chunk of the trail in Pennsylvania is known for its obnoxiously rocky terrain. The trail continued to be pretty easy for the next couple miles and I wondered if he knew what he was talking about. Then I crossed MD 491 and started the 800 foot ascent up Raven Rocks. It was tough going and I was hot and tired. Plus my feet were really hurting now. I really just wanted to stop right there but had to keep pressing on to meet WW at our designated link-up spot. The rocks continued over the backside of the hill. In places,  the trail was not marked well causing me to stop in the middle of a rock pile and peer around for a white blaze or signs of the trail. 
I finally worked my way through the rocks and raced along the final 1.5 miles to Pen Mar County Park, where WW was waiting with a cold Mountain Dew. My very own trail angel. Music to my ears. There was a bathroom at the park and I made use of the sink to rinse my sweat stained shirt and clean up the rest of me as much as possible. I also stretched before getting in the car for the 30-minute ride back to Hagerstown. After a long hot shower, we went to a hole-in-the-wall Italian Restaurant called Dolces. It was delicious. They even threw in complimentary fresh powdered donut bites at the end. Yummy! 
Although it was a hot, long and achy day on the AT, there's nowhere I would rather be.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592815,"It was 70 degrees, 99% humidity, and the winds were calm when I picked up the hike at Pen Mar Park. But the sticky weather was not the worst challenge of the day. It wasn’t the rocks, mud, or climbs either. The toughest part of the hike today was the pesky gnats. Evidently, these little no-see-ems had built up a resistance to Deet. Over a half dozen kamikazes crashed into my eyes. Yeah, it was quite annoying. 
Back to the hike. About a 1/4 mile outside of Pen Mar the trail crossed the Mason-Dixon Line into Pennsylvania. It took 3 full months to hike through the first four states, but only 2 1/2 days to get through West Virginia and Maryland. Whether it is a state line, a town, a landmark, or a hundred mile marker, achieving these small victories provides huge motivation to continue to the ultimate goal. Just past the Mason-Dixon Line was a sign indicating that I was walking along a path that what was an old trolley line in the 1900's. To think, just off the trail once stood Jim’s Popcorn Stand...ice cream and more. 
Other than the weather and gnats, hiking conditions were good today. Not too muddy, not too rocky, and not too hilly. Stretches of the hike were like a walk in the park. Speaking of parks, the trail went by Old Forge Park about 8 miles into my hike. Within ten feet of the trail was a picnic table, fresh water, and two trash cans. I had planned on stopping for lunch a little further along in the hike, but how could I pass up trash cans?
I came to the Tumbling Run Shelters a little further along. It was actually a double shelter with a pavilion in the middle. I wondered if one shelter was for snorers and the other for non-snorers. I thought about Which Way’s annoyance with the loud snorers in the shelters early in our hike. Anyway, this was a very nice shelter among other nice shelters along the trail lately. Trail clubs are responsible for building and maintaining the shelters on the AT. The Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC) is responsible for the shelters scattered all along the trail from Rockfish Gap (Shenandoah South entrance) to Pine Grove Furnace State Park (a day’s hike north). Being from DC, WW and I consider the PATC our local club and we are card-carrying members. A big shout out for the PATC, it’s army of volunteers and others who maintained the trail in West Virginia and Maryland. 
The shelter marked the beginning of the only significant climb of the day, 1,000’ up to Chimney Rock. Not far into the ascent I ran into two PATC volunteers—D and Phase II. They were busy clipping overgrown bushes and raking out erosion ditches. We chatted a bit and I thanked them for helping to maintain the trail. As I was about to take off, a young hiker named Odd Jobs came up the trail. I ended up hiking with him the second half of the hike. Unlike yesterday, today the trail was mostly user friendly, allowing us to move at a fast pace. We ended up knocking out the last 9 miles in under 3 hours. 
The hike ended at Caledonia State Park, where WW was waiting to pick us up. We gave Odd Jobs a ride to the very hiker-friendly Timbers Restaurant, located about a half mile off the trail just outside of Fayetteville, PA. After enjoying a milkshake, we returned Odd Jobs to the park. WW and I then drove about 30 minutes to Chambersburg, PA where we stayed with a former student of mine from National Defense University Eisenhower School. Colonel Ledbetter is now the Commander of the Letterkenny Army Depot. Stephen lives in a beautiful old farm house that is listed in the historical registry. The house, which was built in 1790, is the oldest in Franklin County, PA. It was great catching up with Stephen. He grilled up some delicious steak and chicken kebabs and we even watched a movie. The student and commander-turned-trail-Angel was a great host.
It was another adventurous day on the AT.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592923,"We got our showers and then had some yummy cinnamon rolls with Stephen before saying our good-byes to our friend/Trail Angel. Then we headed north to Carlisle Church of Christ for worship.  We attended church there back in 2006-2007 when Next Step was a student at the Army War College. The Coyles, a sweet family we had met back then invited us to come over after services today and to spend the night at their place. The congregation was  having a Pot Luck today and honoring two high school graduates, one of which just happened to be the Coyles' older son. Of course the last time we had seen him, he was only 6 years old. It’s crazy how time just flies by! We got to visit with several members that we had known from before and made plans to join another family for lunch on Wednesday since we’ll be hiking pretty close to their house then. It was so great catching up with everyone! That’s just another perk of our military life - we have friends all over the U.S. and we just usually seem to pick up right where we left off. Before heading over to the Coyles' house, we ran by Walmart for a bit of resupply. I have my last physical therapy appointment in the morning and am planning to meet Next Step for lunch, so we didn’t need much. We had a wonderful afternoon hanging out, eating pizza and playing games. Melody even made homemade chocolate chip cookies! More friends/Trail Angels who are making this adventure even more incredible because of their love and hospitality! I’m just afraid I’ve had too many days of R&R trying to heal my back. Next Step is going to have to pull me up the hills after so much time off, especially with all the amazing meals we’ve been having instead of eating hiker food! Oh well, what are you going to do?!?! Lol 
Thanks to everyone for all your words of encouragement and especially your prayers. It really means so much to know so many people really care! Just another lesson learned on the trail, don’t wait for things to get bad before you get them checked out. It’s not always a good idea to try to tough it out and hope that your pain will just go away. Hoping the spasms are gone tomorrow and I get the green light to get back out there. I am mentally rejuvenated and ready to knock out the last half of the trail! Let’s do this!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593097,"The day did not get off to a good start. Which Way’s back was spasming all night and was still hurting into the morning. It was not the report she wanted to deliver to the Physical Therapist at her appointment later in the morning.  
It was 9:00 by the time she dropped me off at Caledonia State Park and started making her way to Charles Town, WV for her appointment. The plan was to meet for lunch where the trail crossed Shippensburg Road (about 11 miles into my hike). The morning temperature was perfect as I started the only ascent of the day worth mentioning. Although the total climb was about 1,000 feet, it did not present much of a challenge. The cool temps and easy terrain had a lot to do with the relative ease of the first few miles. About halfway to the top,  sat the Quarry Gap Shelter.  My son and I had camped at this super nice shelter during a 2007 hike from Caledonia State Park to Pine Grove Furnace State Park. A few miles further up the trail stood the Milesburn Cabin. It is a PATC cabin nestled in the woods right next to the trail. Our family rented the cabin with some friends back in 2006 and did some day hikes in the area. We had covered most of the trail from Caledonia State Park to Duncannon when I attended the Army War College in Carlisle in 2006-2007.
I hit Shippensburg Road at 1:00 PM. There was a parking area where I would meet Which Way. I did some stretching as I waited and she showed up about 20 minutes later with Chick-fil-a sandwiches and a cold drink. I could get used to this. WW had texted me when she was on her way from her PT appointment to let me know she had some bad news. As we sat on a rock eating our lunch, she gave me the full report. Her back spasms were continuing and she was advised that she should rest and continue with a recovery routine for 4 more weeks. Obviously, she was crushed by the news, as was I. She has put alot of blood, sweat, and frozen body parts into hiking a 1,000 miles from Springer Mountain, GA, and she wasn’t ready to give it up. You have to have a lot of grit and determination to finish an A.T. Hike, but you also need a good bit of luck. There are so many things that are completely out of a hiker’s control that can pull you off the trail. That said, WW is still resolved to finish this, just not the way she envisioned. Here’s the plan, she will be flying home on Thursday and will follow the doctors orders for the next several weeks. Then, if she is fully recovered, she will rejoin me on the trail for the last five states—Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. We will return another time to knock out the missing states/sections. This is in her gut now and she wants to see it through. As we sat on the rock shedding tears about the setback, we agreed that this has been the best 1,000 miles of our marriage. And we have had a lot of good miles. But, our journey is not over yet. Just a slight detour for WW as I continue to carry the banner forward. 
Just about a mile north of Shippensburg Road, I passed the halfway point on the trail (1,095.45 miles). A sign to mark the occasion would come a little further along. On the way, I passed by the Toms Run Shelter. Just past the shelter was a teenage girl who was down in the mud on her hands and knees planting carrots. She and the boy she was with were graduating from high school this year. She said she was planning to put a note in the shelter journal to let hikers know about the carrot patch and that they would be ready for harvest in August. When I asked the young lady what inspired her to do this, she replied, “I just wanted to plant some carrots.” I thought it was a nice little reminder that whatever dream or passion a person may have, it is just a dream until you put some action behind it. Plant the seed and let it grow. 
The hike ended at Pine Grove Furnace State Park, the home of A.T. Half Gallon Challenge. In order to be a member of the half gallon club, a hiker must eat that amount of ice cream in one sitting. Which Way was waiting for me at the Pine Grove General Store. I went in the store and picked my poison, 1.5 quarts of Cookies and Cream, followed by a pint chaser of Chocolate.  It took me 36 minutes to eat the whole thing. Sadly, I didn’t have any problems putting that much ice cream in my stomach. The hardest part was that my mouth was frozen after about 20 minutes of dishing in the frozen delight. Three other hikers—Mr. Bean, Doc and Chief—showed up as I was starting the challenge and joined in on the fun. I was the first hiker of the day to enter my name into the Half Gallon Club.
With that silliness behind me, we made our way back to Carlisle. Our friends, the Coyles, took us in again. I was eating tasty tacos before I knew it. Yes, I had some cookies and milk for dessert.
Please pray for WW to have safe travels and complete healing of her back. I will dearly miss my hiking partner and best friend, but know that she will hike on with me in spirit.
Peace & Blessings!
Next Step
I’ve been thinking all morning of how to put into words all that I’m feeling right now. I’ve decided it’s just not possible. I have had so many experiences and have learned so much about myself. Next Step and I have been bonded even stronger than before. I have seen his unconditional love played out over and over again. It has been a most humbling experience and an absolutely beautiful experience. Back when we first started this journey and I was getting my knees conditioned for the daily abuse they were taking, I would watch him, completely exhausted, take weight out of my pack and put in his own. Or he would rush ahead of me to try and find a ride to a hostel so I didn’t have to walk the extra .6 miles down the road. He’s wrapped me in an emergency blanket to warm me up only to take it off and tell me we have to keep moving. We hiked two days through a snow storm, but I could follow in his tracks. I’ve seen how proud he is of me when we’ve already hiked 20 miles but we have to go just a little bit farther to find a place to set up camp, even though I felt like my legs couldn’t move another step. Or watching me (a clean freak) slop through days of mud, knowing I’m so far out of my element I might never find my way back. And there is just so much more, way too much to write. But what’s most important is that we’ve had this incredible opportunity to share all of this TOGETHER. And that’s why I’m only saying “See you later” for now. I will do everything in my power to let my back heal, so that I can be there to summit Mt. Katahdin with the love of my life, Next Step. I covet your prayers for him. He tends not to be very cautious when I’m not around. It’s so hard to leave him. To EVERYONE that has either literally crossed our path or been a part of our trail journal, I want to say how much  I thank you from the bottom of my heart for already making this the Grandest Adventure of a Lifetime! 
Hugs

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593205,"First, thank you all so much for the heartfelt messages  you have sent our way. The ongoing words of encouragement and kind deeds coming from friends and strangers alike are part of what make this journey indescribably special. You bring WW and I peace. Another place I find peace is walking in the woods. Ironically, WW delivered me to my place of refuge this morning, returning me to Pine Grove Furnace SP. It was a beautiful morning, with sunshine, cooler temperatures and a nice little breeze. I actually considered putting on my glove liners for a second, then thought I would rather just enjoy the cool air on my hands and goose bumps on my arms.
The hike out of Pine Grove Furnace was literally a stroll in the park. The paved path passed by picnic areas and Fuller Lake with a public beach. It then crossed a bridge and the now gravel path meandered along a swift running creek for about a 1/2 mile. WW and I used to bring our kids and the youth from our church to do day hikes in this same area. I would draw lessons of God’s wonder and grace from His creation that was so alive in this area. Today, I listened to what He had to say to me through nature. Peace, be still. 
The stillness was broken by the cackle of a Red-cockaded Woodpecker. The interesting creatures have teased me lately, but never sat still in one place long enough for me to get a good look. But this morning was different. One of the black and white fellows with the bright red head flew ahead of me several times before perching low on a dead tree just inside the wood line. I stood quietly behind a patch of bushes and watched as he bobbed his head from one side to the other and let out a much lower cackle. I was even able to get a picture (albeit fuzzy). 
The trail took a turn into the woods and worked its way casually back up atop South Mountain. The elevation changes and terrain remained gentle for the first 8 miles of the hike. The peace was again broken when the trail crossed over PA34. The bridge on the road here was under active construction and one lane of traffic was stopped. There was even an orange Appalachian Trail detour sign and a crosswalk signal for hikers. I caught up to Doc and Chief here as they waited to cross the road. I would end up hiking with the two of them all the way into Boiling Springs. Doc and Chief are from Ohio, where their friendship preceded the hike. They are excellent young men who I really enjoyed hiking with and getting to know a little better. 
A couple of miles into our hike together we all stopped for lunch. Of course, I worked in a little stretching too. The 7 miles after lunch presented a mini-roller coaster, with five moderate climbs and dips. It was the fun kind of roller coaster, where the climbs were steep, but not stupidly so; you worked up a sweat, but did not become a heat casualty. You hopped over and around big rocks, but they were dry and without jagged edges. You got a good workout, but it didn’t continue on for three hours after you had reached muscle fatigue. After the first climb we entered into a maze of giant boulders, weaving in, out and over the behemoths scattered along the ridge. The final climb led us up Center Point Knob, where a plaque on a rock signified the original AT mid-point (as the trail has grown longer in distance, the mid-point has moved further south). I remembered doing a few trail runs out of Boiling Springs and up to this point several times during my year at the Army War College. I also remembered the time WW and I hiked up here in about 10 inches of snow. All good memories.
After hiking down for about a mile,  the trail entered open pastures (corn and hay fields). The hay had been freshly cut on one side of the trail, but the grass stood waist deep on the other. We crossed a road and somehow missed a poorly marked left turn through the next field. This added at least an extra 1/2 mile to our hike. 
We reentered the woods for a second before hitting some small roads and crossing a few trout streams as the trail brought us through the backdoor into Boiling Springs. The hike ended much like it started. This time the soft gravel path led us past a large swimming pool, a lake, and to the ATC Mid-Atlantic Regional Office. WW met us on the trail with a Dr. Pepper for Doc and Sweet Tea for Chief. I had casually asked them what their favorite drink was during our hike and texted WW the intel. I must say, she is the cutest Trail Angel I have met. She also brought me a can of Mountain Dew, but I handed it over to Mr. Bean who was also just arriving at the ATC building. 
We offered to take the three hungry hikers to Anali’s Italian restaurant, where we all ordered our own massive Stromboli. A storm moved in as we ate our food and shared trail stories. After dinner, we gave the three hikers a ride to a local hostel, exchanged contact information, and moved on to a hotel WW snagged in Carlisle. I am happy to report that the A.T. in Pennsylvania brought me peace today. I am also thankful that I get to spend a little more time with my Sheesh (aka WW) before she heads home.
Peace & Blessings

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593286,"If you were hoping to read about a big mileage day with lots of rocks and a huge change in elevation, this may be a good day for you to take a break from reading our journal. From Boiling Springs the trail crosses the Cumberland Valley, passing through and along the woodlands of several pastures and farms. It is the longest stretch of flat topography along the entire AT. When I was in the Army War College I loved trail running along this part of the trail. I wasn’t running today, but I did finish the 9 mile hike in just over 2.5 hours. The cool air and pleasant aroma of honeysuckle made the short hike even more enjoyable. A thru hiker from Australia named Reboot walked the entire distance with me. WW met me at one of many road crossings. This particular road was very close to the motel we stayed at last night. She brought several snacks with her for Reboot. He gladly accepted the offer.
After a quick shower, we hustled to downtown Carlisle where I got a haircut and picked up some new shoes at the Appalachian Running Company (5 stars). This makes my third pair of trail runners since Hot Springs. My last pair were pretty beaten up and I didn’t feel confident that they would get me through the rocky conditions that lie ahead.  From the shoe store, we walked about a half mile to a Mediterranean restaurant, Grazery.  A fellow Army officer, who is finishing up his studies at the War College, reached out to me yesterday and said he wanted to try to get together. Steven joined us for lunch and we had a nice chat. I think he definitely has the A.T. bug! There is only one cure that I am aware of...start walking!After lunch we headed over to Carlisle Barracks where we got our Retiree ID cards. The process was pretty painless. Afterwords we swung by the Commissary to pick up some re-supply items and went back to the room to finishing packing me for the hike, WW for her flight out tomorrow and some boxes for shipping.An older couple that we went to church with when we lived here before took us out to dinner at an excellent Italian Restaurant. Dick and Pauline’s generosity did not stop at dinner. When Dick heard that I was hiking into Duncannon tomorrow, he suggested that I let him pick me up and bring me back to their place tomorrow night. I told him that I try my best not to deny someone the opportunity to do good. So, my answer was “Yes!”. I am looking forward to spending a little more time with this amazing couple who are such great examples of what it means to live in Christ.Please continue to keep WW in your prayers as she travels tomorrow.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593395,"Which Way returned me to the trail head and then headed to Baltimore to catch her flight home. It was hard to watch her drive off, but I knew that it was best. It is my hope and prayer that she will fully heal so that we can finish our journey together. For now, I will just carry the torch on my own.
The trail followed the road for a 1/4 mile, crossing I-81 on the first of many bridges I hiked on today. The instant the trail exited the road to cut across an open field, I jumped two rabbits. A bit further,  the path crossed over a fence into a cow pasture. I remembered this pasture from a previous hike with WW. On that day, she got very nervous when all of the cows started to run toward us. Today they would just stay up at the barn. After the cow pasture, the trail continued across more farmland before joining up with the Conodoquinet Creek. A good portion of the trail along the creek was on a boardwalk elevated just above the swampy surface. Eventually the trail crossed to the other side of the creek on a footbridge and took a U-turn under the bridge to follow the creek on the north side. The Scott Farm Appalachian Trail Work Center appeared just as I crossed the bridge. I stopped here to do my morning stretches and sign the register.
Eventually the trail parted ways with the creek and finished the crossing the valley. After passing under Route 944 in a tunnel, it began to climb. The tunnel looked new and I don’t recall it being here in 2007. About 2/3's of the way up the mountain the trees opened up into a nice view back across the Cumberland Valley. At the top of the mountain stood the Darlington Shelter. I stopped in here for a snack. There was a very nice privy (labeled the Taj Mahal) at the shelter. There were two girls sitting at the picnic table when I arrived. The friends had started hiking together at Harper's Ferry. They were still at the shelter when I left.
The A.T. descended the other side of the mountain, crossed PA 850 and continued for about a mile across more pastures. The grass here was up to my chest and I was thankful that the sun had already dried it. 
After exiting the fields, the trail crossed several footbridges over small streams, as it made its final major climb of the day. Once at the top, the path continued along the rocky ridge for about 4.5 miles. There was a nice view of Duncannon and the Susquehanna River from Hawk Rock.  From there it was a steep decline down to the outskirts of the old town where Lightning Glider sleds were manufactured during the 1900's. The A.T. makes its way through the town, following Market Street to the Doyle Hotel. The Doyle, an A.T. institution, started out as a three-story, wooden lodge in the 1770's. The hotel served as a place to rest along the often-traveled Susquehanna River. Charles Dickens once stayed at the hotel. The property burned down and was rebuilt in the early 1900's. The hotel went through several owners - including Adolphus Busch, of Anheuser-Busch fame - until it was purchased by Jim ""Doc"" Doyle in 1944.
Doyle owned the property until the 1990's and it went through several more owner’s hands. Eventually, it came up for sale in the 2000's. Pat and Vicky Kelly are the current owners. I stopped inside to check it out and stayed long enough to enjoy a glass of iced tea and talk to Pat about the Doyle. It's hard to describe the place. For me, the Doyle and much of the rest of the 3 mile hike through Duncannon made me feel like I was stepping into the “Twilight Zone”.  From the Doyle, the trail jogged over to Market Street, which was lined with beautiful old homes. An ice cream truck was headed my way playing music. I hopped across the street to grab a Good Humor Ice Cream Sandwich and continued my casual walk through town. I couldn’t believe I was actually hiking through Duncannon on the AT. I had dreamed of this for years. Every part of the trail from here north is new territory for me. How exciting!
The trail exited town and crossed over two more bridges. First came the old Junita River Bridge, which seems to be in need of repair. Next, was the Clark’s Ferry Bridge, crossing the wide and shallow Susquehanna River. Where the Juniata and Susquehanna came together looked more like a lake than a river. 
The bridge ended at a Park and Ride, where Dick had just arrived to pick me up. Time on target...gotta love it! Dick and Pauline live in Millerstown, a small community to the west of Duncannon. Pauline was waiting at the house for our arrival. She greeted me with a smile (which she always wears) and a hug and introduced me to Sadie, their mixed breed Border Collie After I got a shower, we loaded back into the car and went to a local restaurant for a delicious dinner. We then drove a bit further to Mexico (the town) to a small market that served up tasty ice cream. They obviously know what makes a hungry hiker happy! Back at the house, Dick and Pauline continued to serve as wonderful hosts. The two have been married for 58 years and they absolutely exude love -love for each other, love for humanity, and love for God. I cannot say enough about how sweet this couple is and what a great example they are to me. They epitomize how the love of a couple for one another and for the Lord can influence others in a positive way. 
Being with them helped to ease the pain of not having my Which Way here to show me the way. 
Crossing bridges on the Appalachian Trail today. I am blessed beyond measure.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593512,"On the way back to the trail, I asked Dick to swing by Goodies for breakfast. Since he and Pauline have been picking up the tab at every meal, I told him I could at least treat him to breakfast. Goodies is located in downtown Duncannon across the street from the Doyle Hotel. The place was pretty empty at 0700 with the exception of a couple of hikers. One of them was Twofer, who I hadn’t seen since Hot Springs. He was at the booth across from where Dick and I sat, so we were able to catch up a bit. While Twofer and I were gabbing, that rascal Dick made a beeline for the cash register to pay for the meal. As we were departing Goodies, Twofer ran up to Dick and thanked him for getting his meal too. Evidently the server tipped him off before we got out the door. Dick is truly a generous man and now, a certified trail angel. Dick drove through town, retracing my walk from yesterday, and arrived at the parking lot located on the far side of the Susquehanna River. He said a prayer for me and then we parted ways. His kindness will not soon be forgotten.I exited the parking lot, crossed a busy road, some railroad tracks and entered the woods at around 8:00. Every step of the A.T. we take from here to Maine will be new territory. The hike started with a a steep climb and I was thankful that the heat and humidity had not taken hold yet. My pack was filled with three days of provisions and hadn’t felt this heavy since we started into the Shenandoah NP. The terrain became a little rocky towards the end of the climb, but it was manageable. The Clark’s  Ferry Bridge Shelter is located at the top of climb. I stopped by the shelter to filter water and knock out my morning stretches.The trail continued along the ridge line for the next 12 miles. The terrain was mostly gentle and there were several views along the way. One of the vistas was called Table Rock. It was a perfect spot for lunch. The main course was a salami and Colby pepper jack  sandwich on a whole wheat thin round bread. For dessert, a Starcrunch.
I passed by several day and section hikers during the hike. At one point, I caught up to Boy Scout Troop Leader who had fallen behind his group. The other 13 hikers from the same Troop were spread out over the next two miles. They were out for a 50 mile hike. That is quite an accomplishment youngsters. They all seemed in good spirits.
The trail eventually descended to PA 325 and crossed Clark’s Creek. Just before hitting the road I caught up to two NOBO thru hikers who had skipped forward from Pearisburg to the Cumberland Valley. They started on 29 March, so I guess they felt that they didn’t have enough time to make Katahdin by October. Get ready for the couples trail names—Mighty Mouse (her) and Which Way (him). Totally unacceptable! I had thought about camping alongside the creek, but I didn’t want to deal with the bugs and dew. Plus, it was too close to the road, so I hiked another 3 miles, climbing 1,000 feet. There was a pretty cool tent site located just past the junction of the Horse-Shoe Trail. The site is not listed in the AWOL Guidebook. The thing that makes it a cool site is the stone chairs erected around the campfire. It offered a nice place to sit while I was eating and typing up the journal entry. There was also a little breeze blowing across the top which helped to keep the bugs down.As I was going through the post-hike routine, I really started missing Which Way (the real one). We usually set up the tent and cook together.  It is so much more fun hiking with her. Still, I am living the dream and will not be deterred.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593549,"A noisy animal/bird woke me up at around 1 a.m. and kept me up for awhile with its endless groaning. Needless to say, I was a little slow getting going this morning. It was about 7:15 when I took my last swig of coffee, got up from my stone recliner, and started hiking. Even with the late start, I was  breaking cobwebs for the first couple of miles. I was walking directly into the sun which cast a shimmer on some of the silk strands. This allowed me to take some of the webs down with my hiking poles before I got them full on in the face. The trail was mostly flat, sloping gently down, and soft for the first 9 miles, so I was making good time. Mountain Laurel lined the trail for the first several miles. Some clusters were still in bloom. A whitetail deer danced down the trail in front of me before exiting into the thick underbrush. As usual, dozens of chipmunks darted just under my feet. The squirrels even got into the act of leaping right in front of me today. 
I came past Yellow Springs Campsite a few miles up the trail and signed the trail log. There was a florescent rope used for hanging bear bags dangling from a tree. I contemplated grabbing it just in case another hiker left it behind, but thought that the owner might actually still be camped out of sight. Plus, it looked pretty new so I figured it could belong to a SOBO section hiker. About a mile later I came to a stream and stopped to fill up on water. A young couple—Peebo and Dryl—were finishing up when I arrived. They had just started a flip flop hike in Harper’s Ferry. They left in a hurry and I forgot to mention the rope. 
After getting water I passed a dozen or more PA Air National Guardsmen who were hiking south. They said they were doing a 6 mile “team building” event. Hey, it works for Which Way and Next Step.
Rausch Gap marked the end of the downhill section. Just before the short climb up Second Mountain I noticed a swamp on the left side of the trail. About 50 yards later I came to a low foot bridge crossing a small stream. Just to the left of the bridge a was a beaver dam. The beaver had continued its water management project by extending the dam with a four high levy stretching another 100 yards up the trail. Evidently the project was not finished because water was streaming from the end of the levy all the way back down the trail to the foot bridge.  Two weeks ago I might have just walked through it. But not today. My new shoes had yet to get wet and I wanted to keep it that way, so I put on my camp shoes and proceeded to walk through the water. It was two feet deep in places and was a silty mess. The water was also very cold which was kind of refreshing. After I was above the watery path I stopped to clean and dry my feet. As soon as I sat down to take care of business I was assaulted by a platoon of mosquitoes. The thin veneer of Deet that I applied earlier was no deterrent for these Swamp Skeeters. I quickly reached into my bag and started spraying more repellent. When I switched hands to get the other side sprayed I accidentally depressed the button, sending a stream of bug spray into my mouth and left eye. Now blind, I fumbled around trying to feel for the bite valve to my hydration system so that I could flush out my eye. I eventually got my act together and started up the hill. Up until then I had been on a roll and had planned on cruising right over the 600 foot climb. But after sitting for 20 minutes my muscles had tightened making it difficult to get back up to speed for the first few hundred yards. As I started back down the other side I caught back up to Peebo and Dryl. I remembered to ask them about the rope this time. It was, in fact, theirs. Unfortunately,  I opened a can of worms as they entered into a “discussion” about who was supposed to get the rope. Team Building?!?! Having done enough damage, I eventually opened the gap between me and them. They were planning to catch a ride into Lickdale at Swatara Gap, so I did not see them again today. 
After Swatara Gap the trail passed under I-81 and began a 1,000’ ascent. By now it was the heat of the day, making for a long slow climb. Once at the top, the trail continued for several miles winding along the ridge line. The Mountain Laurel had given way to other forms of undergrowth, including a fair amount of poison ivy. I was still about 4 miles from the shelter where I was planning to stay for the night when the rocks came. The sun was now behind me and casting shadows on the trail ahead. Not only was I dealing with rock hopping and poison ivy dodging, I was also trying to keep an eye out for snakes sunning in the rocks. After a couple of miles the trail softened and the hike ended in much the same way it began, except that I was now exhausted. 
The William Penn Shelter is a nice double-decker structure that sleeps 14. On one side of the trail are some tent sites and on the other stands the shelter. I heard the kind of commotion that isn’t made by long distance hikers coming from the tent site, so I opted for the shelter. Anyway, it might  rain overnight so I’ll take my chances with the bugs. Immediately after turning down the blue blaze trail leading to the shelter I saw another deer. When I arrived at 6:00 p.m. I had the place to myself. The shelter was a quarter mile downhill on one side of the trail and the water coming out of a piped spring was a quarter mile down the other side. Fun!
As I was fixing my dinner another thru hiker named Eddy showed up. Before then, I was starting to think that all of the Springer to Katahdin hikers were stuck back at the Doyle in the Twighlight Zone. We had a nice chat as we ate our dinner. Having someone to talk to serves as a good distraction from me thinking about how much I miss Which Way being here with me. As it turns out, Eddy is planning on joining the military after his hike. Why didn’t I think of that?

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593670,"“Life isn’t about waiting for the storm to pass...it’s about learning to dance in the rain.”
That quote was inscribed on a plate that rested in the kitchen window at the home of some friends we stayed with back in Carlisle. According to Which Way, I am a pretty good slow dancer, but that’s where my ability to move to the music stops. Let’s just say that I’m all arms when it comes to dancing. Well today I learned to dance in the rain, compliments of some good old Pennsylvania rocks.
It rained during the night, making me happy that I opted to stay in the shelter. The William Penn Shelter is a double-decker behemoth that sleeps up to 16 hikers. But last night there were only two of us. Eddy took one side of the bottom deck and I took the other. He was asleep before I settled in last night and was still sleeping when I departed at 6:15 this morning.
When I took off it was only spitting rain and blowing water off the trees. The trail was also nice and soft for the first four miles. It was Sunday and I was longing for WW to be here to do our customary worship together. Instead, I just walked down the trail, praying aloud and lifting up songs of praise. If I didn’t know better, I would say that at one time the birds were actually joining in. The time of meditation and prayer came to an end when I reached a view to the south just before crossing PA 501. There were three young local fellows standing on the rock doing their own Sunday morning thing. Let’s just say there was a lot of hacking going on. That aside, the visibility to the south from this vantage point was actually good. That ended momentarily, as heavy rain was moving in from the northwest. A short distance later I crossed PA 501 and stopped in the parking lot to stretch. It rained on the party of three young dudes and they were back at the parking lot and in their car before I finished my routine. By the time I hit the trail, a steady downpour of rain had commenced. It did not let up for the next 90 minutes. It took even less time before I was drenched from head to toe, with the last stream of water trickling down my spine to you-know-where less than 10 minutes after the rain started. Also commencing on the far side of PA 501 was a nice serving of Pennsylvania rocks. These rocks came in all shapes, sizes and textures, each requiring a different set of maneuvering techniques. 
Let the dance lessons begin.
Some rocks were of the large and flat variety, stacked up like piles of sheet metal in a scrap yard. These rocks were slick and uneven. Many had jagged edges and some were precariously balancing atop other rocks in the pile. This required a slow methodical, but confident approach. Good form and posture were a must. The next thing I knew,I was doing the Waltz. That is until I hit a slanted rock out of step. Then I found myself doing the Electric Slide. The kids would be so proud. Oh, and on some of those teetering slabs, I retrograded into the Shimmy. Where were these moves coming from?
Then there the bowling ball sized rocks that were not quite far enough apart to step in between (at least not intentionally). You guessed it, bip-bop Next Step was doing the Hop! Some rocks were small and jagged. They are the kind that shred hiker shoes apart like they are made of tissue paper. They are uneven and often hard to see. Slipping off the edges is annoying and sometimes painful. For some reason, I find it easier to take these on at a faster pace. Kind of like with a skier doing moguls, timidity is the enemy. For these rocks, I chose the Quick Step. Sometimes there is an insane mix of rocks requiring a freestyle approach. Like the Stutter Step or Shuffle. There was an occasional patch of ground in this 3-mile section with no rocks. It was usually covered up in 2-6” of water—the Swim. All the while, I was tap dancing, with my hiking poles that is. Occasionally one of the poles would lodge between a rock and a hard place just as I was into my next stride. When I hit one of these “wait a minute” spots, it sent me into some wild gyrations that I am pretty sure is illegal in some states.
The rocks and rain both subsided at about the same time. I hit a rock outcropping, where I was fortunate enough to catch a view to the southwest. Although the trail was still under water in many places, I was able to make good time for the final 6-7 miles. Fields of water-laden ferns glowed vibrant green under the heavy gray sky. In the midst of the fern jungle, I passed two neon orange salamanders who had come out to the trail to catch some air. It was a short break for them, and for me.
The rain picked back up and continued for the rest of the day. With the rain falling hard again, I was quickly approaching PA 183. Down the road a piece is the Rock & Sole Hostel, offering a free shuttle ride to and from the trail and to the Dollar General, dinner, breakfast, a hot shower, and a bunk for $40. I was so there. I called Craig and Jody, co-proprietors, from the Fort Dietrich Snyder Monument, located on the trail about .3 miles A.T. south of the parking lot. It was raining hard, my phone was wet, my cold waterlogged fingers weren’t working well, and the reception was poor. “At the monument, need bunk at hostel, please pick-up at PA 183.” Click...I hope Craig got the message. I was at the parking area in a flash. It was still before noon and I had already hiked 13.5 miles, broken up a party, rocked out, and learned to dance. By the way, I also passed the 1,200 mile mark and now am on the 1,000 mile countdown!!! As I waited at the parking lot, hoping that a ride would soon arrive, I did my stretches and told myself I wasn’t cold, even though I was now stationary and getting pelted by the hard rain. Craig showed up just as I was finishing my routine and getting ready to learn break dancing on the asphalt. Hey, it’s better than hypothermia.
Craig (a retired police officer) and Jody’s place had a separate garage out back that was converted to a nice little 6 bed bunk house. It was complete with an outdoor heated shower (yes, a shower in the rain), privy, and plenty of space to maneuver. Given the foul weather, I was surprised to learn that I was the only hiker there. They said they had a big crowd last night, confirming I am hiking between bubbles. I asked Craig if there was a place I could order pizza or something for delivery. He said no, but that Jody would gladly put something together. Did she ever! It was absolutely delectable Blueberry French Toast with a big bowl of a tasty tater tot based recipe. It was so good that I asked her for the recipe. She obliged and was eager to make my stay a pleasant one. Satisfied that everything was cool, Craig told me that he and Jody were taking the day off and that his son Nate would take care of business while they were away. 
After talking to WW and my kids, I did something I had not done in awhile...I took a long nap as my stuff dried out. When I awoke, Nate took me to the Dollar General Store. A little later he brought me dinner—a pulled pork sandwich and the fixin's. 
It is now real midnight and it is still raining. I sure hope it stops before 7:00, when I hit the trail again. However, I will take what the trail gives me.
It’s all good training.

Oh. My. As I was reading the entry to edit it, I could just picture Next Step doing these “moves”! Lol I knew he would find a way to find the humor in his situation. Just one more thing I love about that man! Might have to change his name to “What’s that Step?!?”.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593904,"The rain continued falling throughout the night, but finally pulled out at 7:00. Jody delivered a delicious egg and bacon bagel, a cup of fruit, and fresh coffee, rounding out a perfect stay at the Rock & Soul Hostel. I showed up at the trail head at 7:45 with dry shoes and socks. By 7:50 they were soaked through. The first few miles of the trail had basically been converted to a stream and it was futile to try to avoid walking through water that was ankle deep in places. The only reprieve came in the form of rocks. Eventually I hit a stretch that would have normally been considered soft and gentle. Today, it was just squishy. Sot here were three varieties of trail for the first few hours—streams, rocky, or squishy.
On the bright side, the sun started peaking through the clouds at around 9:30. Dry air moved in and a slight breeze kicked up, making it a gorgeous day for  a hike. Ferns and Mountain Laurel lined the path for much of the morning. About six miles into the hike the trail firmed up a bit. But there turned out to be plenty more rocks to cross and wet trail to walk through. 
Auburn Lookout is a rocky lookout with views to the north. I came to it at about mile 12. It was getting close to 2:00 now and I was getting hungry. I made the decision then that I would eat my lunch now instead of waiting until Port Clinton.  While I was eating, I took my phone off of airplane mode. A text came through from Dick Campbell saying that his grandson, Isaac, wanted to join me on the trail for a day. Dick mentioned that this was a possibility back when I was in Carlisle. Of course, I told him that it would be great and I gave him my general timeline through Pennsylvania. I also mentioned that he would need to hit a moving target (me). Well, the text mentioned that Issac had a day off work on Tuesday, but there were not a lot of other details. I texted some questions back to Dick, ate my lunch, and hiked the steep decline to Port Clinton. 
At the bottom of the mountain the trail crossed a railroad yard and then a river before coming into the small town. My first stop was at the Post Office where I had a new pair of hiking shorts waiting for me. It was about 3:00 now and I was in a quandary about what to do next. I had planned on getting my package and hiking on, as there is not much in the way of eateries along the trail here. But, I hadn’t heard anything back from Dick other than it would be close to 8:00 p.m. before they would arrive. The town of Hamburg is adjacent to Port Clinton. It is home to the country’s largest Cabelas. I noticed in the Guidebook that they offered a free shuttle to and from the trail and that there was a restaurant inside the store. I decided to go for it while I waited to hear back from Dick. The shuttle worked like a dream and 20 minutes later I was at Cabelas eating an early dinner. I was able to make contact with Dick and confirm that Isaac was headed my way tonight. It was about 7 miles to the Windsor Furnace Shelter. The trail crossed Reservoir Road about .3 miles before the shelter. I confirmed that Dick could meet me at the road. It didn’t take long to get a return shuttle back to the trail. I was hiking again by 5:00 p.m. It was about 7 more miles of hiking to the link-up point. The first couple of miles were uphill for about 1,000 feet. The trail had dried considerably and there were only a few rocky parts to impede my progress. I made pretty good time to the road, but then realized that it was gated about a 1/2 mile below where the trail met the gravel road. I called Dick to let him know that I would meet them at the parking area on the other side of the gate. 
I arrived first and had time to do some stretching and look at the guidebook to see what options were available for tomorrow. Dick and Issac arrived a little before 8:00. He had hit a moving target! After a quick introduction with Isaac we were headed back to the trail and then the shelter. Isaac was prepared and traveled light. It was quickly evident that this was not his first rodeo. He aspires to do an A.T. thru hike of his own someday and had lots of questions. However, he had done lots of research on gear and was more up to speed than me on ultra-lite backpacking.
When we arrived at the shelter there were four thru hikers already there. One was in a hammock and the other three were already in their bags in the 6-person shelter. I let them know that Isaac and I would be joining them and the hiker in the middle of the shelter floor adjusted accordingly. I had already warned Isaac that hiker midnight came early and that we would need to move quickly and quietly if other hikers were present when we arrived. No problem, we were settled in by dark. I am looking forward to the hike with Isaac tomorrow. I just hope that his Grandpa can hit one more moving target.
Life is good on the A.T.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594028,"I had an awesome time hiking with Isaac today! It was the best day of hiking I have had since Which Way and I were hiking together. Isaac is a 16 year old rising Junior. He aspires to thru hike the A.T. before going to college to get the education he needs to become a Game Warden. He is already very knowledgeable about wildlife and has extensive back country experience. He and some of his buddies are Bushcrafters, so he brings a minimalist mindset to hiking. Early in the hike I gave him the trail name “The Warden”. I told him since it was given to him on the A.T. he could keep it if he wanted to. He liked it.
We were the first ones out of the shelter at 7:00. The trail immediately ascended about 600 feet. The Warden tackled the climb with no problem. A good sign. It was an absolutely gorgeous day with multiple views which were among the best in Pennsylvania. We also saw three deer,  a snake and other wildlife. I was so glad he got to experience some of the best that Pennsylvania had to offer. Another thing that there was no shortage of today was ROCKS. They came in all shapes and sizes. Like me, The Warden liked maneuvering over and around the bolder fields with larger rocks. He also now shares my disdain for the clusters of small, sharp rocks. 
About 10 miles into the hike we stopped at the Eckville Shelter for lunch. It is one of the only fully enclosed shelters on the AT. It was located down a road about a 1/4 mile off the trail. The shelter sat behind a house where the caretaker lived. This location was the first option for The Warden to get off the trail. The next option would not come for another 11 miles. He said he was feeling good and having a great time and wanted to press on. I reminded him that what we had already completed was just a warm-up for the afternoon hike.
We found our way back to the AT after lunch and immediately began a 1,000’ climb. When we reached the top we stopped for a break at Dan’s Pulpit. While we were relaxing there, a hiker came from the opposite direction and stepped towards us. He immediately asked if I was Next Step. I answered in the affirmative and he introduced himself as Dennis. He had been following our journey through the trail journal and said he was inspired to do his own AT thru hike. Cool! Dennis has signed the guestbook several times, leaving encouraging comments. He whipped out two Snickers Bars for Isaac and me. As The Warden was getting a picture of Dennis and me on a huge rock, I said: “I bet you didn’t know I was a ‘Rock’ Star.”
We hiked more miles over rocks today than I have in any single day on the trail. The Warden was really starting to feel it, but he held on like a champ. Fortunately the trail turned soft for the final 3.5 miles. Pulling The Warden along, we made the distance in an hour, arriving at the Blue Mountain Summit at 6:00 p.m. sharp, our designated meeting time. Dick had just gotten there two minutes before our arrival. He took us down the road a bit for a quick bite to eat and returned me to the Blue Mountain Summit, which permits hikers to tent on the lawn out back for free. Dick and The Warden hung around until I got my tent set up. I thanked Dick for dinner and for linking Isaac up with me.
At one point during the hike I asked The Warden to help me with a title for today’s entry. He said, “How about ‘Becoming A Rock Star?”. In my eyes,  he was just that by the end of the hike. Isaac also told me that the hike would probably be the highlight of his summer and that he wished he could go a couple of more weeks with me. The pleasure was mine buddy. I am thankful that I could be part of your experience and that you shared this part of my journey with me. Keep the dream alive!

",PA Route 309 Blue Mountain Summit,"Jun 12, Tue",20.60
Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594136,"My tent sight behind the Blue Mountain Summit Restaurant was nice, with one exception. As it turns out, PA Route 309, which was less than a 100 yards from where I was trying to sleep is a very busy highway...at all hours. Needless to say, I didn’t get much rest. But rain was moving in, so I packed my stuff up, had a Krispy Kreme Honey Bun and Yoo-hoo for breakfast, and started hiking just before 7:00. The rain came just as I crossed the highway to start the hike. 
It was a light rain and I didn’t mind it at all as I moseyed along on easy terrain for the first two miles. But, it became a big deal when I hit the rocks. Yes, more rocks, and lots of them today. It started with the typical small sharp rocks protruding from the trail. Folklore has it that the locals come out at night with files, to sharpen the edges of these annoying, and sometimes painful rocks. Then came the mossy beanbag-size rocks strewn randomly along the path. I usually like to walk along the jagged tops of these rocks in an effort not to have to step up and down. But when they are wet, if your foot misses the edge by one inch, you are sliding down the side. Plus, the hiking poles become less useful for keeping balance as the carbon tips skid along the rocks. While the usual suspects worked to hinder my progress, it was the new twist to the rock adventure that brought this progress practically to a stand still. It came in the form of gigantic rock slabs stacked high and precariously. The first encounter was up, along, and over Knife's Edge. I had to put my hiking poles away and use both hands to scramble through the maze of slick jumbled rocks. Coming down the other side I had to employ a fifth point of contact, my derrière. More of the same around Bear Rock and then over Baked Oven Knob. There were plenty of view points along the way, but no views, so I just kept slogging along.
The honey bun and Yoo-hoo didn’t have much staying power, so I stopped for an early lunch at the Baked Oven Knob Shelter. I even heated up some tea with honey and waited around for a few minutes until the rain tapered off. While I was sitting there I noticed a flyer advertising a hostel, Bert’s Diner, in the town of Palmerton. That was only about 8 rocky miles away. I was so there and called to arrange for a shuttle into town. 
After a few miles, the hiking actually turned easy again. About two miles from Lehigh Gap (and my ride) I caught up to a father-daughter hiker team named Earthspring (aka Dan Shaffer) and Echo (aka Kim Shaffer). Some of you may be wondering if there is any relation to the legendary AT hiker, Earl Shaffer. The answer is yes! Earl, who was from York, PA was Earthspring’s Uncle and Echo’s Great Uncle. Earl Shaffer, a WWII veteran, was the first person to hike the entire A.T. in one season. He accomplished it in 1948 by hiking from Mt. Oglethorpe, GA (the original southern terminus) to Mt. Katahdin, ME. It took him 124 days. “The Crazy One”, as he was referred to, was also the first person to complete an A.T. hike in both directions, completing a SOBO Hike in 1965. In 1998, when Earl was 79, he set the record for being the oldest person to thru hike the trail. That record was broken last year by an 83 year old hiker named Gray Beard. This year a 89 year old hiker named Pappy is trying to set a new record.
The trail ran right by the George W. Outerbridge Shelter about one mile above Lehigh Gap. As I stood there talking to Earthspring, Echo, and another hiker who was already at the shelter, a little porcupine came waddling along like we weren’t even there. We all got up close to the cute little guy snapping pictures and taking videos until he settled under a rock. 
Earthspring and Echo ended up catching the shuttle to town with me. We ate a late lunch together before they took off to take care of resupply and I settled into the hostel—shower and laundry.
Today the hiking wasn’t the most pleasant hiking day. I was tired, sluggish and my feet hurt pretty badly. But, it was still a good day to be on the A.T. to meet new people, hear new stories, and experience new things.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594314,"Quesadilla & Overdrive, Irish & Luke, Easy Pete, Ninja, Ghost, Stickers & Lady Bug. It looks like I’m not alone on the A.T. after all. These are all Springer to Maine thru hikers that I hiked with or ran into on the trail at some point today.  It was a fun hike out of Lehigh Gap. The trail rose 960’ in one mile to Blue Mountain Ridge. A good portion of the climb was a rock scramble. I put my hiking poles away and used my hands to help pull me and my pack up and over boulders. At one point in the climb I was nearly vertical as I scaled a tricky part of the ascent. I was thankful the rocks were dry. Otherwise, it would not have been a fun climb. 
Several of us reached the view at the top at about the same time and we all celebrated our first mile of the day. It was an absolutely beautiful day, with sunny skies, dry air, and a strong breeze. The first few miles along the ridge cross an EPA Super Fund Site. The landscape had once resembled a wasteland due to contamination from Zinc smelting in the 1900s.  Over time, the land has recovered and I found the hiking here quite enjoyable.
I ran into Ninja and Ghost picking blueberries. I grabbed a few of the tasty treats for myself. I ended up hiking with Ghost for several miles. He is a Marine Veteran who carriers an American Flag with him and unfurls it when he stops for the day. Ghost is hiking partly to promote awareness of the 22 Vets that commit suicide each day. His cause is labeled ""4the22"".
It was all rocks for the last 15 miles of the hike. We just won’t talk about that much. Water sources were practically non-existent along the hike. Running very low on fluids myself, I popped into the LeRoy Smith Shelter, which had a piped stream not so nearby. Several other hikers were already there and a couple of them were complaining about the 1/2 mile trek down hill to retrieve water. PA 33 Wind Gap was just 4.5 miles away. I decided right then that I would prefer to walk .8 miles into Wind Gap to get pizza and refill my water than I would walking a mile round trip to get enough water here to last me through tonight. I kicked it into overdrive, passing Easy Pete and one other hiker on the way to Wind Gap. I told Easy that I was headed to get some pizza as I flew by and he said he would be there too.
It was another .8 miles downhill from the trail to the restaurant. Easy showed up about 15 minutes after me and we shared a table. As it turns out, he just retired from the Air Force. Sadly, he lost his wife to cancer less than a year ago. He talked about how the AT was helping him to find peace. 
When we were done with dinner and had watered-up we decided to catch an Uber back up the hill. Easy was getting a room at a hotel close to the trail. I decided to just hike up and out of the gap in hopes of finding a stealth site before dark. About 1.5 miles later I found my spot. By the time I set up the tent and did some stretching it was dark. Tomorrow I hike to Delaware Water Gap, marking the end of Rocksylvania. I’m ready!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594364,"It was a fun hike today. It was another gorgeous day and the terrain was actually somewhat diverse. Admittedly, knowing that  Pennsylvania would soon be behind me helped put a little extra pep in my step. The first six miles or so were dominated by the annoying Pennsylvania Sharpies. Like an iceberg, most of the rock actually lies below the surface. This means when one of these pointy, sharp-edged rocks is kicked, stepped on, or brushed against, the rock is going nowhere. The sharpies did not totally rule the morning, as I saw a deer and hit some larger slabs of rocks and a bit of technical hiking at Wolf Rocks. 
The Kindridge Shelter is the last one in Pennsylvania for NOBO’s. I stopped there to take my shoes off, stretch, and eat lunch. Soon after leaving the shelter I started hitting stretches of softer trail. It was a welcome relief. The A.T. crossed a roadbed at mile 1290.8. A tenth of a mile further north, I hit the 900-to-go mark, for those of you who prefer counting down. 
As the trail approached Mt Minsi, the terrain improved greatly and views opened up in all directions. It must be a popular area for locals and tourists, as traffic coming from the north picked up. The trail passed by the east shore of Lake Lenape just before hitting a paved road taking me into the tourist town of Delaware Water Gap (DWG). The DWG is a water gap on the border of the U.S. states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania where the Delaware River cuts through a large ridge of the Appalachian Mountains. 
The first building I came to in the small town was the Deer Heads Inn. It is evidently the home to the oldest Jazz Club in America. If Which Way was with me, we probably would have stayed there. I probably also would have taken a Zero Day tomorrow. Instead, I opted to stay at the Church of the Mountain Hiker Hostel and will move on in the morning. Zero Days are just not the same without my WW to share them with, so I guess I’ll just keep moving until my feet can’t stand it anymore. 
Pennsylvania is the fourth largest state on the trail. It provided some of the easiest hiking, as well as the toughest (at least on the feet and shoes). It is a right of passage that A.T. hikers must go through before moving on to what lay ahead. All good training! For me (and WW) it was also a place to rekindle old friendships and develop new ones.
A big thank you to all of the clubs and other organizations that helped to maintain the trail in the Keystone State. I think you missed a few!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594450,"The trail crossed over the Delaware River on I-80, hitting the PA/NJ line at the center point. That makes 7 states down and 7 to go! It is moments like this that I miss Which Way the most. I wish she could be here so that we could celebrate these milestones together. After the long and noisy walk over the bridge, the A.T. passes by the Kittatinny Visitor Center and crosses under I-80. After 1.5 miles of walking on concrete, the trail enters the Northington State Forest at Dunnfield Creek. This area is a popular destination for day and weekend hikers. The morning air was cool and the path was easy as I began the moderate ascent to Kittatinny Mountain. I eased along, listening and watching for signs of wildlife. Something was rustling in the brush next to the trail. It was another porcupine. This one was much larger than the one I saw at the shelter. To my surprise, it climbed 30 feet up a tree and waited for me to move along. 
The first waypoint on the trail was Sunfish Pond. A rocky path circumnavigated the large pond. I heard another rustling noise in the thick undergrowth lining the now, narrow path. This time it was a big brown snake. I could only see its thick body coiled up where the rock and vegetation came together. In the water I saw some really big tadpoles hugging a muddy rock. After the trail reached the rocky summit of Kittatinny Mountain, it continued along a partially open ridge. The path was only about a foot wide as it continued for miles along a ridge. Thick undergrowth and grass brushed up against my legs as I walked along the narrow path. At least it was dry.
After a quick 10 miles I descended to the Mohican Outdoor Center (MOC). Several other thru hikers streamed in as I enjoyed a Club Sandwich and picked up a few resupply items. After lunch the trail climbed out of the valley and again continued along a rugged ridge. By now, the temperature was in the 80's and there was no breeze. The trail sometimes shared old forest roads providing some relief from the mostly rocky path. There were several vistas along the ridge. I took a side trail to a view of Fairview Lake, a resort in the valley below. I longed to be swimming in the cool water or riding in one of the sailboats.
When I hit the trail again it was about 4:30PM. I pulled out a Cliff Bar in hopes of getting an energy boost for the final push. I was approaching a road crossing and, just as I was about to remove the wrapper from the Cliff Bar, I noticed a car parked at the gate. There appeared to be other hikers congregated around the vehicle. Yes - Trail Magic compliments of Mosey & Speed Racer! I passed on the PBR and went straight for the chips and hummus, washed down by a cold Gatorade. For dessert, I scarfed down a nice slice of watermelon.
This gave me the energy boost I needed to finish the last few miles of my hike. I ended up at a campsite adjacent to a small stream. Backwards Hat and his friend set up camp here as well. I’m not sure what exit in the NJ Turnpike this is, but I like it!

When I was with him and we would be in town for meals, he would start trying to figure out where we could go for ice cream before we were even halfway finished with our supper! He spoke very highly of his hostel host, as well. She had shuttled them around today to several different locations at no extra charge. That is the exception, rather than the rule. And it is always greatly appreciated by hikers!! 
Just a quick update on my situation - First, I am just so proud of my amazing Next Step!! He has been busting some miles while I’m away. I can’t even imagine trying to do that alone and I know how much he hates to be away from me. It just breaks my heart. But while it’s been very hard to see all the pictures of him by himself, I am truly cherishing the time I am able to spend with my parents while I let my back heal. They are so precious and are trying hard to make sure I am actually resting and relaxing. (I’m not very good at either one of those!!) You would just have to know them to understand. When you’re at their house, they make you feel like you’re the most special person on the planet. They have an amazing gift of true hospitality!! I’m also happy to report that thankfully, the spasms have finally stopped in my shoulder. I still have some back pain and tightness but I’m REALLY hoping that another week and a half of doing my stretches will be all that it takes for me to be able to put my backpack on without the spasms coming back. I am SO blown away by all of the notes of encouragement and all the prayers that have gone up on my behalf. Thank you again, to all of you for your amazing kindness! I know that if it’s meant to be, then Next Step and I will finish this journey together. Also, a quick update on some special friends that we have met along our journey - Heartburn, Butterknife, Finn and Happy Feet are starting a new adventure sight-seeing and day hiking in California and Oregon. Sadly, Close Call is not going to be able to come back to the trail this year due to his knee injury.  Spirit Man also had to come off the trail for now, as well. They all truly feel like family and I pray that our paths cross again. We have made some incredible memories together and will be forever bound by our experiences on this adventure. I am so looking forward to rejoining Next Step at the end of the month! Please keep the prayers coming. I’ll do my part and if that’s His plan, then that is where I’ll be!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594711,"After feeding us a hearty breakfast, Mosey shuttled me and Szcut back to the trail. When we started our hike at 7:00 it was still a little cloudy and muggy, but soon a front would push on through, drying out the air and providing a breeze for most of the day. The trail started out a little rocky and the ground was still wet from the rain that came last night, so the going was a little slow at first. After about a mile I came to an observation deck with a view of the highest point in New Jersey and the valley below. It was also an excellent place to stretch. Szcut came and went as I conducted my daily routine. 
After passing the high point, the trail conditions improved considerably and dropped into lowlands. Several old rock walls marked property boundaries from years past. The trail also passed in and out of pastures and around a few farm ponds. A road or stream crossing would occasionally mark the transition from one landscape to the next. It always amazes me at how diverse the terrain can be over any given day of hiking. 
About 8.5 miles into the hike the A.T. crossed a farm road near a stream. The stream marked the NJ/NY border. Less than a 1/3 of a mile down the road was the little town of Unionville, NY. It sounded like an excellent place to stop for lunch. For about two miles leading up to the hike, I was loosely hiking along with Szcut, Ironman, and Steamboat. Szcut and Ironman decided to join me in Unionville, while Steamboat chugged on. Like most small towns in this region, it had long passed its heyday. On the short walk into town, we passed an abandoned site where a rubber factory once operated and across the road, was  a rundown auction house where farmers once brought their crops to market. Nonetheless, the town was still quaint and I found the locals to be hiker friendly. This is contrary to what I recall reading in at least one A.T. book. Once in town, we refilled our water at a spigot on the side of the municipal building. Ironman made a beeline for Annabel’s Pizza Restaurant. Szcut and I opted for Horler’s General Store. I had a Turkey Sub and grabbed an Italian Sandwich and a few re-supply items to go. We sat on the front porch of the General Store enjoying our meal and made use of the outlets to give our phones a bump charge. After we ate, I went inside to get rid of my trash and noticed a man (Herman) that had just been hanging around since we arrived. You guessed it, I yogied a ride from Herman. A few minutes later, Szcut and I piled in Herman’s truck and were happy not to have to walk back uphill to the trail. 
Almost two hours after we hit town, we were finally hiking again. We continued to skirt the state line, eventually dipping back into New Jersey.  About two miles later the trail joined with a couple of country roads, which we walked along for over a mile. 
The A.T. then passed through the wetlands of the Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge, making a 2-mile circuit around marshes and ponds that provide a habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife. I got some pretty good pictures of cranes (one in flight), a swan and a deer. I watched the deer stroll about a hundred yards into the marsh to feast on something. When it detected my presence, he looked up at me with a mouth full of branches and leaves. As he made a dash for the woods, he had to come across the trail. I got lucky and captured a picture of him in mid-flight as he crossed.
After exiting the nature preserve, the trail followed low footbridges through a swamp area before ascending 1,200 feet up Pochuck mountain. Part of the climb was rocky and steep, but overall it wasn’t too bad. At the top of Pochuck was a rock outcropping with a view all the way back to High Point. Look closely and you will see the monument in the picture. I think Szcut and Ironman were planning to stay at the Pochuck Shelter. Since it was only 3:00, I pressed on. After working my way down Pochuck Mountain, I crossed another country road.  From here the trail continued along a boardwalk for one mile. Shortly after the boardwalk I passed through a cow pasture and crossed NJ 94. Decision time. It was 5:50 now and the next 1.5 miles was up the “Stairway to Heaven.” Also, there was little evidence of any tent sites for the next few miles. Meanwhile, 200 yards down NJ 94 stood the Heaven Hill Farm and some ice cream. I figured I should think what to do over two scoops of chocolate. The place closed at 6PM and I made it in at the last minute. The young ladies closing the place up did not seem to mind at all. As I sat outside eating my dessert before dinner, I decided to walk .2 miles back up NJ 94 to a place called Rickey Farms. It offered a tent site and a shower for $10. I’ll take  both, thank you. I was hesitant, but it turned out to be a good move.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594871,"The day started with a climb up to Walawanda Mountain. The trail ascended out of the valley into an old growth forest with giant boulders strewn along the mountainside. A big black blob next to one of the boulders caused me to pause. Yep, it’s a bear; and a big one at that. It was about 50 yards to my front and was casually moving across the trail. I talked to it some and clanged my hiking poles together to let it know I was in the area. It didn’t seem to care. What’s this? Another bear came trudging up the mountain, behind the boulder and across the trail. Then a third bear. It was then that I realized that it was a sow and her two full grown cubs. If I had seen either of the cubs alone, I would have assumed it was an adult bear. I wasn’t sure what they are eating to get so big, so fast, but I hoped it wasn’t hikers! 
After the bears moved a safe distance away, I continued on the path, now below them. A few minutes later I was climbing the steep part of the mountain, known as “The Stairway to Heaven”. I had stopped to talk to a chipmunk (yes, I talk to the wildlife) when Iron Man came up behind me. We continued together to the top and took in an amazing view that spanned beyond High Point, all the way back to Delaware Water Gap. 
I descended a bit and then the trail surface became quite gentle. It remained that way for most of what was left of New Jersey. After several miles of “easy” hiking I took a side trail to the Wawayanda State Park HQs. I did some stretching and got water while my phone charged a bit. 
Soon after I started walking again I came across the frog-filled Kazmar Pond. The hiking remained easy until about 2:00, when I reached the New York State Line. The trail had been following the NJ/NY border since High Point, occasionally dipping into New York. The trail took a turn northeast and the marker signified that I was leaving New Jersey for the final time—8 states down, 6 to go!
I had heard that New York contained some pretty challenging obstacles. Well, the first three miles certainly confirmed that. I was almost immediately greeted by a rock scramble as I worked my way up the open rocky ridge leading to Prospect Rock, the highest point on the AT in New York. From there the trail hit a series of dips down and climbs up crags and huge slabs of granite with what looked like marble and some lava rock (giving it a purplish tint). There is a lot going on in these rocks from a geological point of view. This novice mind just knew that it looked cool and was fun to hike over. Several rock croppings also served as amazing vistas, with multiple views of Greenwood Lake and Sterling Ridge. There were several times during the hike where I was using my hands and feet to get over rock obstacles. One rock was so steep that climbing rungs were inserted into a rock wall to assist hikers. 
About three miles trail south of NY Route 17A the trail turned gentle again. It was a good thing because I was getting hungry and ready to make a beeline for the Bellvale Farms Creamery, located about a 1/4 mile down the highway. When I was about a half mile out I decided that ice cream alone would not make for a balanced meal, so I googled “pizza.” Franks Pizza got great reviews and they would deliver to the creamery. Forty minutes later I was demolishing a large salad and delicious New York style pizza. I washed it down with a cold soda made at the creamery. Then it was a large dip of some of the smoothest chocolate ice cream I have ever had. Now I was ready to hike the final 2.5 miles to the Wildcat Shelter. 
On the way to the shelter,  I passed over the Eastern Pinnacles, with its open Rocky Crags and  Cat Rocks, which were rocky ledges with huge crevices cut into the rocks. Both provided fun obstacles and good views. It was already dusk when I reached the shelter and dark soon after I got set up and climbed in my tent. No birds were chirping tonight. Instead, it was the droning buzz of swarming mosquitoes. It’s okay, they are out there and I’m in here, feeling happy, and full!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594978,"Now I’m sure that I have your attention! And if you went straight to the photos after reading the title, welcome back and no spoilers please. 
The rain started around 10PM last night and continued until around 6:30 this morning. This resulted in a late start. I packed up everything but my tent and walked up to the shelter to cook breakfast. By the time I finished up and packed up my wet tent it was a little after 8AM. I hit the trail a few minutes behind Steamboat and walked out of camp with a young couple  named Splash (him) and Sunshine (her). The couple started a flip flop hike at Harpers Ferry. After reaching Mt Katahdin they will get a ride back to Harpers Ferry and hike south to Springer Mtn.  Lately, about half of the hikers I see are flip floppers or hikers picking up where they left off in a previous year. About a mile into the hike we came to Fitzgerald Falls, where Sunshine & Flash stopped for a break. I would leap frog with them and Steamboat and a few other hikers the rest of the day. Shortly after leaving Sunshine and Flash I came across another couple who had camped next to the trail. The man reminded me that today was the summer solstice and that I should beware of naked hikers. National Hike Naked Day falls on the first day of summer. The answer is no, I did not hike naked. I just couldn’t justify using up all that deet on previously covered flesh. You see, among the mosquitos, the first day of summer is referred to “Feast on a Naked Hiker Day.” 
The skies had cleared and it was warming up by 0900. About four miles into the hike I stopped at a clearing and laid my tent out to dry on the rocks. By the time I finished my morning stretches the ripstop nylon material was dry. I heard some folks talking and laughing in the woods just to my south. A few minutes later the couple told me to beware of naked hikers emerging. They were fully clothed, but told me they had stopped just before reaching me to get dressed after hiking a mile in the buff. I was glad I missed that.
Evidently New York has its own version of the roller coaster. This version involves continuous short and steep rises and falls. Many of the climbs involve a rock scramble at the top. The total ascents and descents today were over 4,000’ each and I had to work for every mile hiked. The hot sun made it an even bigger challenge. The trail crossed over Mombasa High Point, Buchcanan Mtn, Arden Mtn, and other unnamed boulder-filled summits and ledges. Good water sources are also scarce in this section. Thankfully,  some trail angels had dropped dozens of one gallon water jugs at several road crossings. I would top off my water bladder and down about a liter at each stop. Even so, it was hard staying hydrated on a hot day over tough terrain. 
In the afternoon I crossed over I-87. The trail entered Harriman State Park just north of the interstate. After an initial steep climb, the path descend to Island Pond, which looked more like a lake to me. The scenery in the park is beautiful, with wide open old growth forests, lush ferns and wispy tufts of green grass, and giant granite boulders strewn across the landscape. However, the hiking was still hard work. A little after the pond I came to a rock obstacle called The Lemon Squeezer. I think it may have been the single hardest 100 yards I have hiked to this point on the AT. After passing through a rock tunnel, the trail continues through a narrowing rock crevice. As the ledges above got lower,  the walls closed in. To make matters worse, the rocks were on about a 10 degree tilt. At one point I thought my backpack was going to get stuck, but I managed my way through. To exit the Lemon Squeezer I had to climb up and over a nearly vertical ledge. I actually had to remove my pack and hoist it with my poles over the top before finding a way to shimmy myself up. My phone was dead, so I screenshotted some pictures from the Guthook App.
A few miles later the trail crossed a road that led to Lake Tiorati Beach, where there were showers, vending machines, and an outlet to charge my phone. I joined Sunshine and Splash at a picnic table next to the vending machines. Steamboat would arrive about 15 minutes later. After plugging in my phone I headed to the shower, which also served as a washing machine for my funky clothes. I then cooked my dinner, which I washed down with a soda from the vending machine. It was 5 pm when I arrived at the lake and 7 pm when I departed to knock out the final few miles of the hike. Other hikers were still trickling in when I left. 
It was dusk when I arrived at the William

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595050,"As is usually the case, a late arrival to camp resulted in a later departure than I would have liked. By the time I hit the tent last night, it was dark and I was tired from a long hard day of hiking. It is a good kind of tired, but not the kind that I can fight through while I stay up to work on a journal. So, I barely got finished with my notes and then ZZZZZZZZs. Early to bed means early to rise, but first I felt compelled to finish up the entry. I must admit, I am conflicted sometimes about keeping up with a journal while hiking 8-12 hours a day.  Sometimes I just want to live in the moment and maybe do a better job of planning for what is ahead (the Next Step in me). On the other hand, I think capturing the details while they are fresh in my mind is a worthwhile effort. First, it may be something Which Way and I will want to look back over sometime in the future. We may also decide to do some edits and have it bound so we can pass it down to the kids and grandchildren (when they come). Also, it is a way for us to give a little something back to the trail community. For me, reading trial journals was a big part of my preparation and a way to help keep the dream alive. A final benefit to keeping a journal is something we had not even thought about going into the journey. That is all of the words of encouragement and prayers lifted up by you, the readers. The last time I checked there were over 250,000 hits to our journal site. I never expected that so many people would be following our journey, but knowing that you are,  is part of what motivates me to keep hiking and keep journaling. Wouldn’t want to let the readers down—lol. Seriously, WW and I are both humbled by the outpouring of love and concern that comes from strangers. This unexpected part of our journey is one we will cherish forever.
By the time I wrapped up the journal text (pics would have to wait until later) and started hiking, it was 0700. Immediately upon departing the shelter area I was climbing rocks, this time up Black Mountain. From the top were great views of Bear Mountain, the Hudson River and the New York City Skyline. I stopped at one of the vistas to stretch. I also checked to see what the hours of the Bear Mountain Post Office were. I had a package there and I was afraid I would hit the small post office during lunch. To my surprise the hours of the little satellite office are 9-11 daily. It was 0830 now and I still had 8.5 trail miles to go (plus another .4 to the P.O.). 
 I was really kicking myself for not getting an earlier start now. Anyway, I kicked it into high hear in hopes of covering the ground in 2.5 hours. After racing down Black Mountain I crossed the busy Palisades Interstate Highway, which connects New York City to Connecticut. I made it up and over West Mountain in pretty good time, but making it to the post office before 11  was looking doubtful. I decided to call and see if I could work something out. After finally getting the number to the Bear Mtn Post Office, the Postmaster, Kim, said she could run the package over to Fort Montgomery for me. That office did not close for lunch until 1PM. Perfect. 
Now I could relax and enjoy the hike over Bear Mountain, an AT milestone. The hike up was a bit steep, but the trail was well kept, making it an easy trek. A lot of effort had gone into placing stepping stones along the trail on both sides of the mountain.  I counted at least 300 steps going up the mountain.  The trail also traversed its way through and around (vs over) huge boulders. It is also the first time that I have seen switchbacks since entering New York. During the ascent I found some stones marking mile 1,400–woohoo! At the top of Bear Mtn stood an Observation Tower. There were also lots of tourists at the top and day hikers during the descent. I try to say hello to other hikers as I pass by. As you can imagine, I often get stopped and asked if I am hiking the AT. I guess they smell me coming. Where did you start? When? Where are you hiking to? How long will it take? I try to hang around long enough to answer all of the questions and provide encouragement to wannabe AT Hikers. You never can tell when kids with their parents might be listening more than it appears and get a seed planted. It was an easy hike down Bear Mountain (albeit all of the steps were a little hard on the knees) and around Hessian Lake. On the far side of the clear lake the AT took a right turn to go under US Route 9. I continued straight here and walked another mile to the post office. Walking on the concrete in the heat, it would be my hardest mile of the day.
I arrived at the Fort Montgomery Post Office at noon and took care of business. Afterward, I walked another kilometer up the road to Bear Mountain Pizza. They sold great pizza by the slice. Their gelato was delicious as well. I hung out for about two hours letting my phone charge and loading the rest of the pics from Days 118 and 119.  Gotta keep the readers happy!
Not being real keen of the idea of walking back to the trail, I called for an Uber. The driver returned me to the point on US 9 where I got off and I was hiking again at 3PM.  I walked up a grassy knoll then crossed under the road through a tunnel. On the far side of the tunnel the trail entered The Trailside Zoo and Museum. Walking through the zoo for about a quarter mile, I had some “first” animal sightings along the AT. I saw a fox and a brown bear. I guess Bill Bryson was technically correct when he featured a brown bear on the cover of his book, “A Walk In The Woods.” I also saw a bobcat,  but I don’t think it was my first sighting. I had an animal about that size slink across the trail back in mid-Pennsylvania. At the time, it happened so fast that I was unable to confirm what I had seen. I stood there for several minutes trying to process what I had seen, at the same time hoping it would reappear. Since I wasn’t sure I never mentioned it in my journal. A few days later when I was hiking with The Warden, he told me it probably was a bobcat. Seeing the one in the zoo today solidified it even more. It’s a good thing for my visit to the zoo, otherwise this would have been the first time in a long time that I did not see any wildlife, except for squirrels and chipmunks. Deer have been pretty much a daily thing, so I don’t always mention it in the journal. By the way, the zoo is where I hit the low point on the hike. Literally! The elevation dropped to 160 feet, making it the lowest point on the trail. I guess it’s all uphill from here.
After exiting the zoo,  I hit another milestone as the trail crossed over the Potomac River on the Bear Mountain Bridge. I looked down at the river below and noticed several swimmers going down river, each with a support kayak following close behind. I looked back over my shoulder and saw the historic site of Fort Montgomery along the West Bank. The wind was blowing in my face and I was waving at slow moving cars as they passed by. Most people waved back or tooted their horn. This sense of pure joy and elation washed over me as I smiled and waved and thought about how blessed I was to be at that spot at that moment. Part of me wanted to jump the median and walk down the center line high fiving and low fiving drivers. Perhaps I’d even do a hand jiving. I learned that on the Pennsylvania rocks. Then I thought, “What would Which Way do?” and I got myself back under control.
After crossing the bridge,  the trail took me up and around one final mountain. I stopped on the way up to talk to a few day hikers who smelled me coming. A little ways after the top I came to the Hemlock Springs Campsite, where there is room for about three tents. I had planned to hike another three miles to the Appalachian Market, for dinner and re-supply. Then I  would walk another 1/2 mile to the Graymore Spiritual Life Center for free tenting and a shower. But then I would be arriving just before dark again and be behind the power curve. It was 4:30PM now and I decided I’d just stop here and get ahead of the game. Besides, at the rate I’m going I will beat Which Way to Salisbury by two days. 
After I was all set-up, Lucky Boy, Ghost, Kylo, Overdrive, Quesadilla, and a few other hikers trickled by as they were on their way to the Appalachian Market. While I was enjoying some hot tea and Sugar Wafers, three young day hikers named Emilio, Christina and Andrew stopped by for a chat. The awesome young adults had lots of questions about the trail. I was happy to share answers and truly enjoyed their company. Emilio hopes to hike the trail some day. I encouraged him to keep the dream alive. The three spontaneously became trail angels, handing me water and snacks from their bags. Never deny someone the opportunity to do good.
Snowshoe and Sailor would eventually show up and hammock here. Epic came in just a few minutes ago. It just turned dark and I’m finished with today’s post. Mission accomplished!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595151,"I mentioned on the Father’s Day Post that my Dad taught me the concept of deferred gratification. Today I had an opportunity to put the principle into practice. It rained on and off last night, but a break came at dawn, so I made a dash to get my stuff packed up and head to the Appalachian Market. It was about 3.5 miles to the intersection of US Route 9 and NY Route 403. It was here that the AT crossed the two roads. The Shell Service Station (Appalachian Market) is located at the same intersection. The market is open 24/7 and has a deli and grill that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. I deferred the dinner last night to have the gratification of breakfast this morning. This is not exactly what my Dad was trying to impart, but I’m counting it as having applied the principle. Another opportunity would come later in the day. When I reached the Appalachian Market at 0715 the parking lot at the market was full. When I walked through the door,  I was surprised to see a bunch of guys ordering up breakfast from the grill before they headed off to work. I took it as a good sign. I sat down with a couple of gentlemen from Puerto Rico. They had lots of questions about the trail.  Two hours after arriving, I walked out with a full stomach, a mostly charged phone, and two days of food, to include a deli sandwich for lunch.
The terrain and elevation profile were easy to moderate most of the day. Still I was sluggish most of the morning. 99 percent of the hike was under canopy. The path was often cut into hillsides just below ledges and rocky ridges. This was a nice reprieve from going up and over every ledge. However, there was still some of these apparent PUDs (pointless ups and downs) today. The forest contained an abundance of tall White and Red Oaks, Maple, Hickory and Birch Trees. Lush ferns, green tufts of grass, blueberry bushes, and mountain laurel lined the path. There were also miles of old stone walls again today. I speculate that early settlers cleared the land of rocks to make room for their crops. The trail also passed several blowdowns today. Each was about an eighth of a mile swath of fallen and sometimes snapped trees. The blowdowns resulted from a storm in mid-May that brought a lot of rain and wind. It had to take a lot to bring down these sturdy massive trees. The roots of the toppled behemoths were filled with tons of dirt and very large rocks. The NY/NJ Trail Conservancy has done a great job of responding to the natural disaster by cutting a path through the blowdowns. I hit the first blowdown at the base of Denning Hill. At the top was a grassy ledge with view to the east. I paused here for a snack. Lunch would come about 5 miles later. As I sat against a boulder enjoying my ham and salami on wheat, Pulitzer walked up and we chatted for several minutes. Epic was a few minutes behind her. They were both planning to stop at the Clarence Fahnestock SP about 8 miles up the trail. At the state park was a beach, snack bar, water spigot and a shower located just a quarter mile off the AT. I told them it would be a last minute decision based primarily on the time and weather.  I finished up my lunch at 1:15PM and shot down a 5-hour energy in an effort to shake the cobwebs. It worked! I was finally able to kick into a higher gear, perhaps partially motivated by the thought of a burger at the beachside cafe. About five minutes in I passed by Epic and Pulitzer, who were taking a break of their own. About midway into the 8-mile stretch I came across a mother-daughter pair of thru hikers from Denmark. The Mom, Dirty Girl, was catching her breath at the top of a short PUD. I introduced myself and moved on. A burger and shower were waiting. It was around 4:15PM when I approached the side trail to the beach. A quick weather check indicated that rain was not moving in anytime soon. Earlier forecasts had called for late afternoon storms. I also surveyed camping options on Guthook. The three options were a campground next to the beach, the Shenandoah Campsite (4 miles north), or the Ralph’s Peak Hikers’ Cabin (RPH) located 5.2 miles north. I was also 22 miles from the road that would get me into a town Sunday night. More rain was forecast for Sunday afternoon and I was past due for a real shower. My feet were already hurting and I knew it would be difficult to get moving again if I stopped. I decided in an instant to keep moving and shoot for the RPH Shelter. I would defer the instant gratification of the burger for a shot at getting to bed earlier tonight and to town at a decent hour tomorrow. But, the gratification would come sooner than expected. Not even two minutes after I passed the side trail leading to the beach (and a water spigot), I sucked the last drink out of my 1.5 liter Platypus hydration bladder. I only had about two swigs of Gatorade left from my stop at the market. I checked water sources between here and the shelter. There were several options. While looking for Guthook comments on water at the RPH, something else caught my eye. The shelter (actually a cabin converted to a shelter) was located next to a gravel road with easy access from a nearby town. Wait for it...other hikers left comments about pizza and Chinese food being delivered to the cabin. Well, isn’t that just dandy! Now I was praying for easy terrain for two reasons. First, I wanted the two swigs of Gatorade to get me to the RPH. Next, my dogs were already barking and I was really hoping to minimize any further pain to my flaming big toes and arches. I knew the real pain would not come until after I laid down for the night, but let’s at least minimizing the yelping over this next 5 miles. The climb up Shenandoah Mountain started out a bit rocky, but then the ground turned gentle. I decided to turn two swigs into three sips, using one at the top of the climb. At the summit I got a view of the surrounding area and the clouds looked full of rain. It would end up holding off. However, the forest was both dark and tranquil from the thick clouds. A deer stopped to pose for me. Sorry, no time for pics, gotta keep these tired feet moving, The rest of the hike was mostly downhill, making it hard on my left knee that had been aching for about a week now. However, the ground was mostly soft, keeping the puppies at bay. One more small climb, second sip of Gatorade. Then I passed by the Shenandoah campsite, just 1.2 miles to go. Final sip...across a stream, I’ll wait. 
When I arrived at the RPH there was quite a bit of activity. A work crew was finishing up some clean up from a blowdown that occurred at the shelter. There was also a Boy scout Troop camped here. Among the hikers already at the RHP were Lucky Boy, Quesadilla & Overdrive. Steamboat would arrive later. New decision point, pizza or Chinese? I’m in the mood for Chinese about three times a year. This would be one of those times. I called the restaurant and ordered a General Taos, Egg Roll and a coke. $15 minimum. Give me two more egg rolls. It arrived in less than 45 minutes, before I had even finished my post hike ritual. I gave Lucky Boy the two extra spring rolls and inhaled the rest. We all sat around the picnic table and talked hiker trash. Good food, good company, good laughs and good times on the AT. Deferred gratification, a good thing. I followed the meal with an 800mg Vitamin I, in hopes of deferring some foot pain too. Good night!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595267,"The terrain and landscape  today was much like yesterday. When I departed the RPH Shelter at 0700, the air was soupy thick. The trail crossed over a footbridge, worked its way through a swampy area and then under the Taconic State Parkway. From there the trail began a steady rise up Hosner Mountain, crossing through more blowdown along the way. In this section some very large trees were snapped in half, indicating that perhaps a twister had hit here.
I stopped at the top of the climb to stretch and to call my sweet Which Way. While we chatted, Quesadilla and Overdrive hiked by. A minute later came Steamboat. Rarely do hikers actually walk together for more than a few minutes during the day. However, shelters and other waypoints bring us together throughout and at the end of the day.  
Coming down the mountain I ran into a man walking up with an ax and a tree saw. He introduced himself as Elvis the 4,000 miler, saying he had hiked the AT twice in the 1970s. He was responsible for maintaining a section of the trail. I must say that he is doing a great job, as the AT was well manicured all the way down to the next road crossing. 
More ups and downs and road crossings dominated the next several miles. I hiked over Stormville Mountain, crossed over I-84 and then climbed Egbert Mountain.  A shelter is located along the ridge of Egbert. I stopped there for a quick lunch and to refill my water from a pump well. The water was cold, but it tasted of metal. 
In the last 5 miles of the hike the trail took me around Nuclear Lake where I saw a swimmer and a woman on a paddle board. I also spotted my daily deer close to the lake. It started to rain just as the trail turned away from the lake to go up West Mountain. As is usually the case, I had picked up the pace after lunch. When the rain started, I kicked it into overdrive. Three miles (and a couple of wipeouts on slick rocks) later and I was crossing West Dover Road. This is where the Dover Oak stood mighty and tall. It is the largest tree on the AT and is estimated to be over 300 years old. Steamboat was already at the road when I arrived. He was heading into the town of Pawling, NY to catch a train to New York City, where he would meet a friend. He said that Quesadilla and Overdrive were on their way down to the road too. They were also looking for a ride to Pawling, where they could take a train to the city. I was headed into Pawling for the night, so I called the Pawling Cab Company to request a lift for the four of us. The rain was coming down hard now and we were taking cover under the big oak. The water was puddling up on the road and the girls jumped in it and started rinsing the dirt off their legs and arms. I bet the two of them would have never imagined 3 months ago that they would be taking a bath in  the middle of a highway. 
The taxi arrived about 20 minutes later and we all piled in and headed to town. The driver dropped us all off at the train station. Steamboat and the girls walked up to the platform to catch the next train to NYC. Never mind that they were smelly and drenched. The Station Inn was across the street from the train depot. That is where I was staying for the night. I got to my room, took a shower (aahh) and cleaned up my gear. The train tracks run right down the middle of the cute little town of Pawling. On the other side of the tracks from the Station Inn several eateries and other businesses lined the street. My first stop was the laundry mat. As I was finishing up there, Epic came around the corner drenched from a second storm that just came through. He said he was going to do some laundry and head about a mile down the road to sleep at the town pavilion. I told him he could get a shower at my room and that there was plenty of room on the floor if he wanted to sleep there. His eyes lit up as he replied with a resounding “Yes!”. After getting Epic settled I went to find a place to eat. The hot wings appetizer was showing up just as Epic showed up. He was dry and refreshed from the shower. He owns a combatives school in the Seattle area. They teach Brazilian Jujitsu and other self defense skills. His clientele ranges from after school programs to Special Forces Soldiers. It was nice to have an opportunity to get to know him a little better.
Back at the room, Epic dialed up a movie on his Amazon Prime Account. I fell asleep in the opening minutes. A perfect ending to another good day on the AT. Counting down the days and miles until WW is at my side again.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595397,"It was 0915 when the taxi dropped Epic and me back at the trail. From the Dover Oak the path went through a swampy patch. Then it gained elevation and crossed into a pasture. The air was dry and a cool breeze stirred the tall grass around me. After a mile or so I was back in the forest where I passed several old trees that rivaled the Dover Oak. I was keeping my head up in search of my morning deer when a snake slithered quickly away. Otherwise, I probably would have stepped on it. Now my gaze was set lower and about a half mile later I came across a big crawdad making its way across the trail. It seemed a little out of place, as the nearest stream was a quarter mile away. I wanted to get a picture of this peculiar sight, but the critter was about to move off the path. In an effort to slow its progress I planted  one of my hiking poles just in front of the speedster. He immediately went into defense mode, lifting 2/3s of his body off the ground, claws raised above his head. When I brought the camera close to get a pic, the little guy lunged at me, snapping his claws as he surged forward. Then he resumed his fight stance, I chuckled and got his picture. I walked a few steps away while looking at the pic. I didn’t like the way it turned out. No problem, when I turned around, the fighter was still in the same spot with his claws raised high in the air. He was ready to rumble.
After my encounter with the fighting crawdad I continued down hill a few hundred yards to the Swamp River. A 1/4 mile long boardwalk crossed over the river and adjacent wetlands, which were thick with marsh flora. I exited the boardwalk at some railroad tracks. On the other side of the tracks stood a train platform. A rider could catch a train into New York City from here. The stop was aptly named “Appalachian Trail”. Immediately after crossing the tracks the trail took a left turn on NY Route 22, following it for a couple of hundred yards. On the left side of the road stood the hiker friendly Native Landscapes Garden Center. I stopped to grab a cold drink. A food truck was setting up in the parking lot and would begin serving in about 15 minutes. Believe it or not, I passed on the food and kept moving.
Back on the trail, I walked another mile or so through more pastureland. On top of a hill stood a wooden water tower. The trail worked its way back into the woods and meandered up to Hammersly Ridge. The trail followed the ridge through a pristine forest for several miles. I felt so alive as I walked along, taking in the sights and sounds, and breathing in the fresh air. I passed a cute shelter along the way. The Wiley Shelter would be the last one in New York. 
From the shelter it was downhill to the Deuel Hollow Brook. The trail crossed the brook on a bridge and dumped out on Hoyt Road, where it continued for a hundred yards. Just after exiting the road the trail came to a sign that announced my arrival into Connecticut, “The Gateway to New England.” The AT will continue through Connecticut for 51.6 miles. I have always dreamed of walking on the AT through New England. The time had finally arrived. Better yet, this is the state where I meet back up with my sweetheart. I have tried not to harp on my time alone without Which Way, but I do miss her so much. They say that absence makes the heart grow fonder. Well, my heart can’t grow any fonder for that gal. Shoot, when we’re at home, I even miss her when she goes to the store. Just gotta keep moving and we will be back together soon, as it was meant to be.
New York was a fun and challenging state to hike through. A big thanks to the New York State Park Commissions, the NY/NJ AT Conservancy and an army of volunteers that maintain the AT through the state. 
Connecticut greeted me with a little climb up Ten Mile Hill. Down the other side of the hill the trail crossed the Bull’s  Bridge 19th Century Covered Bridge over the Ten Mile River at its confluence with the Housatonic River. The trail worked its way upstream of the Housatonic for about a mile. A side road led to Bull’s Bridge, a 19th Century covered bridge. On the far side of the bridge was a country store. I stopped in for some dinner and re-supply. The store was run by a friendly Indian couple. Wouldn’t you know it, they had Chicken Vindaloo in the frozen food section. I hung around the store until about 5:45PM. It was about a 4 mile hike from there, up and over Schaghticoke Mountain to the campsite where I was staying for the night. When I arrived Epic was already cozy in his hammock. We were the only two hikers at the campsite. The tempature is supposed to drop into the 40s tonight. Love it!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595474,"Today you get the Reader’s Digest version—to the point. I got a late start, primarily because I fell asleep writing the journal entry from yesterday (not unusual). But, I didn’t wake up at O’dark-thirty to finish it (unusual). So, I was chewing up precious hiking time in the cool morning air playing journal catchup. Which means that I didn’t get started hiking until 0900. That’s not going to happen tonight, as I am leaned up against a tree, feeding the mosquitos, and I’m not going to get in the tent until I’m finished writing. Now, that’s motivation. Unfortunately I do not have any signal, so I will have to stop along the way tomorrow to upload pictures and the journal entry. Rats! 
The hike started with 7 climbs in as many miles. Two of the ascents were over 500 feet. The terrain was reminiscent of southern New York. After the final climb up Calebs Peak and short distance to  St. Johns Ledges, the descent became insanely steep. There were some large stone steps, but they would even make Shaq stretch as he reached for the next step (no pun intended). 
In stark contrast to the first seven miles, the next five were easy sailing. The AT  rejoined the Housatonic River and the path ran smooth and flat about 30 feet above the water. It was a nice break. Then came the final four miles which featured two climbs over 500 feet in elevation gain. I stopped at the Silver Hill Campsite about half way up the first climb. There was a nice swing there that I sat on as I ate a snack. I also called a hostel that was listed in the Guidebook and got great reviews on Guthook. It would be another five miles to the road crossing leading to the hostel. Unfortunately, I reached a recording that said the hostel was closed for renovations. My only other options were to hike 3 miles to the Caesar Brook Campsite, 6 miles to the Pine Swamp Brook Shelter, or stealth camp. Given the terrain and water options, I didn’t want to chance finding a good stealth site. Hiking 6 miles to the shelter would put me at camp past 7PM. Besides, with a name like Swamp Brook, it sounded like a haven for mosquitoes. So I opted for the shorter hike which would put me at camp a little after 5:30PM.
As I merged into the AT from the Spring Hill Campsite I thought I saw a Ghost. I did, and I caught up with him just over the crest of the climb. He said he was done for the day and was looking for a spot to stealth. Epic would text me later to let me know he was stopping at Cornwall Bridge. Too late. I already passed it up. Ghost and Epic had both stopped for lunch in Kent. Good move.
After a few more ups and downs I arrived at the campsite. There was only one other hiker there. He started the trail in late March and had been busting big miles. Apparently it was catching up with him now.  He had only hiked 6 miles today and 12 the day before. 
I arrived at camp so early that I actually had time to soak my feet in the cold stream before dinner. I am pretty sure that the Knorr Spanish Rice meal with pepperonis were delightful. Unfortunately, they were so hot and I was so hungry that I scorched my tongue and googler on the first bite. I couldn’t taste much after that.
Which Way will be hitting the road tomorrow headed my way. It will be a two day drive for her. Please pray for safe travels and that she is able to continue the journey with me until the end. I will continue hiking until she arrives. Our new rendezvous point may change to Great Barrington, MA. I will let you know more tomorrow. 
Now it’s getting dark and the skeeters are out for blood. My blood! Love ya’ll!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595550,"Well, I definitely got an early start today. It was 0600 when I donned my pack and slipped out of camp. As is often the case, the trail gained elevation from the get go. Similar to yesterday’s hike, I was on a mini-roller coaster for the first seven miles or so. After the initial climb, I descended about 400 feet, crossed Carse Brook on a footbridge, then crossed a country road. Then it was back up a steep and rocky climb. At the mid-point was a huge crevice called Split Rock. This one was a bit wider than the Lemon Squeezer, so I had no problems maneuvering through it. I passed through the crevice, finished the ascent, then descended to the Pine Swamp Brook Shelter. When I arrived I was immediately hit by a squadron of mosquitoes. The only signs of human life was a hiker who had set up her tent inside the shelter. I guess the blood suckers were deprived of their usual dose of hiker blood and they decided to take it out on me. Needless to say, I cut my stretching session short. I finished the climb up Sharon Mtn by 1100, then started working my way down to the little town of Falls Village. I planned to eat lunch at a restaurant, but was disappointed to find out that they were closed on Wednesdays. Bummer! I was able to grab a Yahoo to wash down a Cliff Bar.
I departed Falls Village, once again crossing the Housatonic River over an Iron Bridge. Just above the bridge was a view of Great Falls. The water came crashing down hard over the Falls. 
By lunch, Which Way had departed in a rental car on a 12 hour journey of her own. I knew I wouldn’t see her until tomorrow, but it didn’t seem to slow me down any. I powered up the 3-mile climb to Mt. Prospect and then came crashing down the other side. The original rendezvous point with Which Way was Salisbury, CT. That is where I would finish the hike today. An elderly lady names Maria opens her home to hikers. She has been doing so for the last 19 years. Maria picked me up just outside of town and ran me by the post office before taking me to her place. Three other hikers were already there. 
You know the drill—shower, eat, laundry and re-supply. I checked everything off the list. Now I need some rest, as I am planning to hike across four mountains over 20 miles tomorrow. Did I mention it was supposed to rain? Oh well, I’d do it in a blizzard knowing that my gal will be waiting on the other end.  Gotta go!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595707,"What a day! It was full of milestones and adventure. Without a doubt, the highlight of the day was at the end of the hike when I crossed US 7 and ran into the arms of Which Way.  But, the way to that moment was a 20 mile rainy day hike, across two states and five amazing peaks of the Taconic Mountains. Which Way started her day in Hazleton, PA, after an adventurous night of her own. She may want to talk more about that on tomorrow’s Zero Day post. It would be about a five hour drive for her to make it to our rendezvous point just outside of Great Barrington, MA. Of course, I wanted to get there as early in the day as possible. The only issue was getting up and down those five peaks in the rain. 
It had rained most of the night and was storming when I got  up at 0430 to check the weather. The hourly forecast called for a 100% chance of rain between 6AM and 10AM, then the chances dropped no lower than 85% for the remainder of the day.  I almost called the hike off, but decided to go for it. It is not that I mind hiking in the rain, but I knew that the terrain would include some stretches along open rocky ridges, ledges, and steep drops. First, I didn’t want to be caught in a lightning storm on top of one of the peaks. Since I had been struck by lightning when I was a kid (I know, that explains a lot), I rationalized that the chances of it happening again were low. Work with me here. The bigger concern was hiking across rain-soaked rocky ledges and down steep rocky slopes. I knew that I would be in a hurry today to get to WW, but didn’t want to risk ending the hike on a hard fall. I tossed the options back and forth in my head for a minute and then decided to give it a go. I could always change my mind going up the first peak. In the end, I just couldn’t sit still. Plus, while Salisbury is a quant little town, Great Barrington was a better option for a Zero Day. 
So I got up, packed up, and went to the kitchen to cook up some breakfast. Maria provides hikers three eggs, a banana, orange juice, and coffee, but said she does not come out from her beauty sleep until 0900. When I walked out the door at 0600 none of the other three hikers staying at Maria’s had stirred. The rain had subsided a little as I walked about a mile along the 2-lane road to the trailhead. For the first time in three days,  I passed a deer that was munching on a roadside bush. I have seen at least one deer a day on 70 out of the past 75 days. Only the squirrels and chipmunks have a better showing. 
The rain picked up just about the time I hit the trail. It grew progressively stronger as I ascended Lion’s Head Mountain, the first of five peaks. Not too far up the trail I passed a misplaced sign indicating that I was at the 1,500 mile mark. Actually, I hit that milestone late in the hike yesterday. The sign was outdated by a couple of years when the trail was 1.7 miles shorter. Nonetheless, I took a picture and moved on. The 800’ climb up Lion’s Head was over two miles, making it relatively easy. At first, the trail did not have too much standing water and I was able to avoid most puddles. But as I approached the top, where there was less vegetation and the trail became rockier, a steam of water was flowing down it. By now, my shoes and socks were squishy wet and the stream of water was flowing down my spine. Invigorating! At the summit I continued along rocky ledges for a bit and then started a small decent. One down, four to go!
Riga Shelter was 150 yards off the trail about 3.5 miles into the hike. I decided to pop in to stretch and see if any other hikers were around. I passed one tent and crossed a swollen stream as I neared the shelter.  Ghost, Lucky Boy and two flip floppers who started at Delaware Water Gap were inside the shelter. They were just beginning to stir and seemed a little astonished that I had already hiked up from town. Ghost and Lucky Boy indicated that they were hiking on shortly. Good, someone to recover my body if I fall. Plus, it was nice to know I wasn’t the only lunatic on the mountain today. The rain started to ease up a little as I stretched and we talked. Ghost pulled up the radar and said it looked like some drier air was moving in. Hmm, answered prayer? 
It was another 500 feet of elevation gain to Bear Mountain, the highest peak in Connecticut. Although the rain had stopped, the rocks were still slippery wet and the trail was under water in spots. A giant rock cairn at the top  of Bear Mtn served as a marker indicating that I had reached the highest peak. The cairn was erected in 1885 by a masonry named Owen Travis. The AT meandered along rock ledges, passing several would-be views. Then came a very steep and rocky drop. At one point, I had to toss my hiking poles down and face the ledge, clinging to a jagged edge or tree root and feeling below for a good foot hold. Needless to say, it was slow going. 
The trail entered Sagas Ravine, winding just above a torrent of rushing water. The rock slabs were mossy here and the tree roots were slick. Obviously, finding a good spot (jagged edge or crease in the rock) is important. But, I’ve also learned that, like in downhill skiing, shifting  my weight downhill makes the descent a lot easier. It is counterintuitive to lean forward. But, putting my weight on my heals (putting on the brakes) inevitably results in my feet sliding out from under me. Momentum also helps to prevent falls. So, the tricky part is finding just the right amount of forward momentum to keep from slipping, while avoiding a hard crash. I fell several times today, but they all were  a result of me losing focus on what seemed like a relatively easy spot. Usually, it’s feet up, poles flying, and me landing on my pack. Although, I did splat face first late in the day on a flat section, tripping over an obscure root. 
The trail crossed the raging steam further down the ravine on a footbridge. Just on the other side was a sign welcoming me to Massachusetts. I made the final four. Woo-hoo! No time to celebrate. A 1000’ climb up Mount Race lie just ahead. More rocky ledges at the top, but an easier decent. The trail was lined with blueberry bushes, scrub oaks, mountain laurels and some dark green stunted pine trees.
Then came the grueling climb up Mount Everett. It involved traversing my way up a steep rock slope. Generally, I found the best footing where the water flowed down the mountain. This is where I could find the best foothold as I looked for a small pit in the granite to plant the tip of my hiking pole. It would have been a challenge on a nice day. It was borderline treacherous on a wet day. A few spots were so precarious that wooden steps were bolted into the rock. I noticed a few of the steps discarded to the side and nothing but broken bolts in the rock. I thought, “must be careful with the steps too.”  The rocky top of Mount Everett sits on the Massachusetts and New York border. At the top are the four foundation pillars of an old fire tower. I sat on one of the pillars, took off my drenched shoes and socks and ate my lunch. Everett made me think of Mount Everest, the tallest peak in the world. Over the first 1,500 miles, the AT has ascended over 313,000 feet! That is the equivalent to climbing Mt Everest from sea level 10 times. Oh, and the descent is also over 313K, making it twice the feat. Back to Everett though. It was about 1PM and I still had over 11 miles to go. After lunch and a quick call to check on WW, I put a pair of dry socks on under my still damp shoes and started down the mountain. It felt good for a minute, but soon I was splishing and splashing again. The initial decent wasn’t too bad. After a mile or so the trail crosses Mt Everett Road into a parking and picnic area. Trail Angels had left several gallons of water on one of the picnic tables.  It wasn’t really needed today, but certainly was appreciated. 
It was a short ascent up the final peak, Mount Brushnell. From the top, the trail continued along a ridge. The sun was actually peeking through the clouds now, allowing for some partial views of the valley to the east and south. At the northend of the ridge was another rocky ledge called Jug End. Heavy rain moved in again and continued on and off for the rest of the hike. The final decent into the valley got tricky from Jug End. I ended up on the ground more than once, but managed to get through it without any scrapes or bruises.
Once the trail hit MA 41, the trail flattened, traveling in and out of swamps, pine forests, and pastures as I crossed the valley. My WW was within reach now and about four miles out I picked up a jog-walk-jog pace. A couple of small hills and a few road road crossings to go. The rain stopped about a mile out. I was at a steady jog now. Over some railroad tracks. Just a quarter mile left. As I ran through the final field I could see her getting out of the vehicle to meet me. I crossed the road and ran 50 more yards into her open arms. Together again at last!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595753,"What a sweet sight...my Next Step running across the field to get to me!! From my car I couldnt really tell where in the woods he would be coming from, I just knew where the trail crossed the road. I had looked down at my phone to check the time and when I looked back up, there he was, in a dead sprint! Didn't matter that he had just hiked 20 miles in rainy and treacherous conditions. I couldn’t help but tear up just knowing that we were going to be back together again in a matter of seconds! Made me think of another time I had been waiting for us to be back together, but that time it was for HIS return. Back in 1991 when he was returning from a deployment to the Gulf War, I was at an Air Force hangar waiting for his plane to arrive. Many of the spouses were there, standing on the pavement watching the sky. And then, way off in the distance we saw a tiny light and we all started cheering because we knew that was their plane! Our loved ones were just moments away from us! All of the soldiers got off the plane and were still quite far from where we were all gathered. And of course, they were all dressed in their BDUs and maroon berets. You would think it would have been impossible to tell one from the other from so far away. But I knew his walk as soon as I saw him and I took off in a sprint to run out to meet him! Had lots of tears in my eyes that day!! I was so thankful he made it back safely. 
As he mentioned, I had quite an adventure of my own, on my drive back to our meeting spot. I left Mount Sterling, KY around 10:30 am on Wednesday. My precious parents took me to the rental car agency and sang “Happy Trails” as I got in the rental car. We all held up our “I love you” sign as I drove out of sight. They were so happy that I was going to be able to finish the journey with Next Step. But I know it was hard for them to watch me drive off not knowing if I had healed enough to be able to actually hike another 700 miles with my full backpack. We’ll know soon enough :-)
I had planned to drive until about 8:30 pm on the first day of my trip. Didn’t want to overdo it. I pulled into the first motel I found and was disappointed that the only room they had was a suite. Way more than I needed for just myself, so I decided to drive a bit farther. As soon as I got back on the interstate, there was a sign indicating that there was a fog alert. No worries, I’ll just get off at the next exit with a motel. By that time it was starting to get dark and the farther I drove, the thicker the fog was getting. I saw a sign for a motel at the next exit, but the fog was so heavy that I literally passed the exit ramp!  I was driving on the shoulder and thought I was on the highway until the shoulder came to an end!!! By this time I was white-knuckled and only driving about 40 mph when I got back on the actual road! I saw another sign for a motel and slowed down even more so that I wouldn't pass it up this time. When I made it to the lobby, the clerk told me that she had just given the last room to the couple in front of me, but she could give me directions to another motel not far away. Sure! No problem! I can barely even see my car, I’m sure I can find it!!! At this point, I could only see the dotted lines in the middle of the highway. Not sure if the lines on the shoulder were there or not. I had decided that if the next motel did not have a vacancy I would just drive across the street to the Mc Donalds and sleep in a booth. Fortunately she had one room left. It was a Smoking room, but that was no longer an issue. Just give me the key so I can lie down before I pass out from fright! Of course it started pouring as soon as I got ready to get my stuff out of the car. I just grabbed my wallet and keys and decided anything else could wait until the morning. After living in the woods for three months my “needs” have greatly decreased!! By then it was about 10:30; way past hiker midnight. I was just thankful to be there all in one piece. 
I headed out on Thursday around 8 am and made it to Miss Maria’s Place in Salisbury, CT at noon to pick up some Next Step’s gear. Had a BEAUTIFUL drive thru New York and Connecticut. Amazing what a difference a day can make?!?! Drove on to Great Barrington, MA and found a great little lunch  spot, the Bistro Box. Did a re-con to find where the trail crossed Route 7 so I wouldnt have any trouble finding Next Step. Of course I earned my trail name all over again. Enough said. Found us a motel and got my gear unloaded. Then headed back to wait for him to arrive. We’ve already covered all of that, but it still makes me smile to think about it. 
We’ve had a wonderful zero day today which started with breakfast at the local donut shop. Ghost and Epic came in while we were there, so we were able to take them to town to get Epic some new hiking shoes and then drop them at the laundromat. They were planning on hiking 30 miles today, so that might be the only time I ever get to see them. By then it was time for lunch so I took Next Step to the Bistro Box for burgers, which were amazing BTW. We decided to keep our rental vehicle for a couple of extra days, just to make sure my back is going to cooperate. So we drove out to where we plan to finish our hike tomorrow to see if there was a good place to leave the car. There wasn't, but Next Step came up with Plan B and talked our motel owner into giving us a ride to the start point tomorrow morning and then he’ll yogie us a ride back to the motel tomorrow to pick up the car. Fortunately, some things never change. Lol
We ended the zero with a movie...shocker. Perfect ending to our Zero! Now time to call it a day and just hope that everything goes well tomorrow. But for right now, I’m just glad to be right where I am at this moment, with my Next Step!
Hugs,

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595889,"The owner of the Monument Mountain Motel was kind enough to give us a lift to the trail. He even suggested that he follow us to the parking area where we planned on ending our hike so that we could drop our car. He then gave us a ride back to the spot on US 7 where I met Which Way. 
We had already decided to limit the miles until WW was ready (as anyone can be) to ramp it up again. Also, we were both carrying a light load. With a heat advisory in effect over the next few days, we wanted to try to get an early start. Still, it was 0745 before we hit the AT.
The trail started today much like it ended on Thursday, passing through fields and winding along lowlands on low footbridges. Feeling a little giddy, WW took off like a ball out of a cannon as I happily struggled to keep the pace. She seemed to be in true form and it felt so good to have her walking in front of me again. I talked her ear off for the first couple of miles, talking about nothing and everything. About 1.5 miles into the hike we crossed the Housatonic River and started our only significant climb of the day. A 1,000 foot ascent over 2.5 miles delivered us to the top of East Mountain. Along the ridge at the top we stopped on a ledge overlooking the valley to the west. It offered a clear view of the South Taconic Range. I gleefully pointed out the Bear, Race, Everett and Bushnell Mountains that I hiked over to to make it to our rendezvous point. She was impressed...music to my ears!  It was so nice having her here to experience everything first hand again. The best part, was that I could tell she had really missed being immersed in the journey.
We eased up and down along the ridge and hiked past a shelter. From there, the trail passed along the edge of deep ravine. It then began a descent through a conifer forest. Essentially it was all downhill from there and the hike was over a little after noon. I wish I could say it was all good. During the last hour of the hike I noticed WW tucking her right arm into her side while grasping her shoulder strap in her hand. I asked if her shoulder was hurting, to which she replied, “yes”. I told her that she needed to hike without a pack tomorrow to see if that alleviates the pain. She will also try to minimize the use of her hiking poles, saving them for the technical parts. I have been tucking mine away for considerable parts of the hike lately and I think it has helped.
After the hike we drove back to Great Barrington to pick up a package at the Post Office and grab a bite to eat, followed by ice cream, of course! We are tented at the Berkshire South Community Center tonight. For a small fee,  hikers are permitted to use the shower inside the community center. After our showers and getting our tent set up we decided to drive up to Pittsfield to get a few things from Walmart and grab supper. Gotta take advantage of having wheels while we can.  
Now it is dark and it sounds like there is a bit of a party breaking out on the lawn below us. I hope someone keys the group in on the meaning of hiker midnight. 
In the days ahead we need to keep moving forward, but we will try to do so smartly. The severe heat will certainly be extra motivation to limit our miles this coming week. It will be dangerously hot for all hikers. Please keep us all in your prayers.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595993,"The party on the Community Center lawn went on well into the night. This meant very little sleep for the the tenters beyond the wood line.  Nonetheless, Which Way and I were packed up and headed towards the trail before 0600. With the heat index forecasted to be above 100, we wanted to get an early start. It was a 2-minute drive to McDonalds, where we were to meet our ride to the trail. An AT 2,000 Miler named Iceman was our Trail Angel of the day. He has been following our journey and reached out to volunteer his services. There is an ultra-marathon runner who is trying to break a record for completing the entire AT.  The current record is 45 days, 12 hours, 15 minutes. Iceman has been supporting the runner since Pennsylvania and landed in Great Barrington yesterday. After breakfast  Iceman followed us up to drop our car and then shuttled us to the start point. Thanks Iceman!
When we started hiking at 0700 the temperature was still bearable. It would heat up significantly as the day wore on. Which Way was hiking without a pack today. I carried enough water for both of us. Unfortunately, it didn’t help her situation much. As soon as we started climbing, her back started hurting. It is very frustrating for her. 
The trail was much like the day before. However, today we hiked along a couple of ponds. There were also some neat ledges at the top of our first climb. We paused there to worship. Towards the middle of the hike we passed through a large swath of coniferous forest. Part of this section was down a ravine where cool air seeped out from under huge mossy rocks with ferns growing on top of them. 
The trail crossed a gravel road deep in the forest about 9 miles into the hike. We decided it was best for WW to wait there while I finished the last 3 miles. The trail descended a bit more before climbing up and over Tryingham Cobble. The hill looked over the very small town and a cemetery. The final mile consisted of walking through a cow pasture and some marsh lands. This was all in the open and the heat was on. I reached Main Road, where we had dropped the car, at 2PM. It was a short drive to pickup WW. From there we reached Lee, MA, in just a few minutes, where we would stay for the night. We took showers and put ice packs on Which Way’s back and just took it easy the rest of the day. 
Which Way will rest tomorrow while I knock out some more miles. How many miles will depend on when I get started and how I hold up with the heat index well over 100 again.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596101,"As it turns out, breakfast is not served before 0700 in the little town of Lee, CT. Its okay though because I needed to sleep in a little. After breakfast WW dropped me at trail and I hiked on. The day hadn’t heated up too much as I started the 1,000 foot ascent to Baldy Mountain. The real issue was the gnats. I’ve become accustomed to the pesky insects flying around my head. But for some reason, they decided to go
Kamikaze on me today. In total, about a dozen of relentless pests dive bombed into my eyes. Just as I would dig the remains of one out and look up, another maniac would fly in. A few brave ones went for the nose. One of the flyers got me on an inhale and ended up shooting right through my nasal cavity, landing in my throat. Flying bugs on the AT is one thing I could do without just fine. 
After summiting Baldy Mtn. (not really bald) the trail dropped down to Goose Pond. The iconic Upper Goose Pond Cabin is located about a half mile off the trail. Many hikers congregate here for a swim on a hot summer day. Evidently the caretaker also serves up pancakes in the morning. After hiking along the shore for a minute I came to a boat dock that would have been a good spot to get a picture and take a quick dip. Unfortunately, there was a rather large group of non-hikers milling around the trail and blocking the way to the dock. I said hello and kept moving, hoping to clear the area before any of the tidy folks inhaled.
The plan for today was to meet WW at the halfway point and take a run into Lee for lunch. Less than a mile from our link-up spot the trail crossed the Massachusetts Turnpike. A footbridge crossed over the eastbound lanes and the trail worked its way through a small wooded area before another footbridge crossed the westbound lanes. The path then looped under the bridge along the turnpike. A sign on the road welcomed drivers to The Berkshires. The Berkshires is a rural region in the mountains of western Massachusetts dotted with villages and towns. It is a popular vacation destination, known for outdoor activities, fall foliage, farm-to-table food scene, thriving arts institutions, and renouned annual festivals. The quaint little Massachusetts towns we have been passing through are part of the Berkshires.
Immediately after turning away from the turnpike, the trail came to the shore of Greenwater Pond. The Berkshire Lakeside Lodge sat on a the western shore and had a nice little beach area for guests. The trail re-entered the woods, crossing over Cooper Creek on a footbridge. A minute later it crossed US 20, where I met WW at a parking area. We went into town to grab a sandwich and then I took a siesta. I could get used to this.
After a three hour break in the hottest part of the day, I was hiking again at 3:30PM. The air immediately felt cooler when I entered the wood line. However, I was drenched in sweat again before I finished the 700’ climb up Beckett Mtn. Save a few short rocky segments, the trail was nice today. The diverse terrain and landscape kept things interesting. The occasional breeze even made the conditions tolerable. 
It was an easy walk from Becket Mtn to Walling Mtn. From there, the trail dropped down to another large body of water—Finerty Pond. The AT followed the picturesque pond for about a quarter mile. From the pond, it was slightly downhill to Washington Mtn. Brook and then up to a beaver bog. Up and over another small ridge and then a gradual descent through a peaceful forest. At 6PM I crossed West Branch Rd. The hike ended here. Within a minute my chariot, and cute little driver, came along to take me away. 
Back in town we did some laundry and grabbed some pizza. We also talked about the plan looking forward. The recurring injury has been a real kick in the gut for WW. Still, she is not ready to give up hope of rejoining me on the trail. However, it is getting expensive for her to follow along with me. So, here’s the plan. After the 4th, she is driving up to Burlington, VT to stay with extended relatives for about a week. If she feels better then, she will try one last time to rejoin me on the trail. Please keep praying for that to happen. As much as I want this for me, I want it even more for her. There are still some amazing views, challenges, and experiences ahead. It would be awesome to share them together. As it should be!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596176,"It was 0830 when I resumed my hike. The elevation profile was mainly flat for the first six miles of the hike. The trail moved in and out of pine strands and crossed multiple small streams. The ground was marshy and foot boards sporadically lined the path along the way. Roots and wet rocks kept my focus on the ground. Although the temperature was not as high as previous days, the humidity was turned up and I was drenched in sweat within an hour. 
The trail led me to Warner Hill about six miles into the hike. Although it was classified as a hill and the climb up was insignificant, it felt more like a mountain at the top. At an elevation of 2,005 feet, the opening of the summit offered an excellent view to the north. Mount Greylock was clearly visible across the valley below The top was rocky and had an arid look. Blueberry bushes engulfed the path.
Just off the crest of the hill, a field of ferns cast a bright green hue, in sharp contrast to the rugged landscape just 100 yards to the top. These are the views/experiences that make a long sweaty hike worth it for me. As usual, my first thought is, “This is awesome.” My second thought is, “I wish WW was here to see this.” 
From Warner Hill it was another six miles, mostly downhill, to the town of Dalton, MA. The steady descent was interrupted by a short rocky climb over a ridge, where I caught up to a mother-daughter pair of section hikers. They were the first and only hikers I saw all morning. Departing the woods at the outskirts of Dalton, the trail crossed some railroad tracks and once again crossed the Housatonic River. It then worked its way to the downtown area. Like the rest of the towns in this area, Dalton is clean and charming. Cute wooden homes,  decorated in a patriotic flair, line the streets of this hiker friendly town. The best part for me was in the middle of town, where I would meet WW for lunch. We hung out together at Angelina’s Sub Shop for about an hour before I watered up and finished my hike out of town. After crossing the railroad tracks, the trail followed along roads and sidewalks for a total of 1.5 miles. After walking a mile from downtown on concrete and being exposed to the scorching sun, it felt good when I finally hit the wood line again. 
Once in the forest, the trail started a long ascent to Crystal Mountain. Just as I was beginning the climb, another hiker raced downhill towards me. As he got closer I noticed that he was wearing a bug net. As he approached, he greeted me with, “The mosquitoes in this area are gnarly!”. He looked like a long distance hiker so I asked him where he started his hike. As he flew by he answered, “Katahdin!” Looking back now, I said, “You’re the first SOBO end to end hiker I’ve met”. Still moving away at breakneck speed, he looked over his shoulder and said, “There are two or three in front of me”. Looking ahead now I murmured, “Gnarly”. I was excited to see my first, of what will be many,  Katahdin SOBOs. But, I had hope to have a longer conversation with him. It was clear that the SOBO did not want to take time to talk to me. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, I figure he was in a rush for one of three reasons. First, he was making a beeline for a cheeseburger, fries, and a milkshake. Second, he wanted to be the first SOBO to reach Springer Mtn. and needed to catch the 2-3 hikers in front of him. Finally, he was trying to outrun a swarm of gnarly mosquitoes! The third reason had me alittle concerned. My fear slowly subsided as I worked my way up the mountain and never ran into the said “gnarly” skeeters. When I came to Gore Pond, the perfect staging area for all things gnarly, I came to the conclusion that the SOBO was delusional. Then the seed of a new fear was planted. Had the White Mountains psychologically scarred the poor hiker?!?!
By the time I reached the top of Crystal Mountain I was drenched in sweat again. By now, my shorts were soaked through and the dreaded chafing was reaching the gnarly level. It was especially bad around my waist band on my hips and low back. I stopped to lather on some Lanicane, adjust the hip belt on my pack, and tuck in my shirt. It helped.
After a short descent off of Crystal Mountain, I took a side trail to the Cheshire Cobble. This massive marble outcropping had a great view to the west. The little village of Cheshire was nestled below, with Mt. Greylock looming behind it and the Cheshire Reservoir to its south. Once again, I thought if WW were here...I’d try to talk her into staying put right here as the sun set in front of us...then she would say, “No, we are going to that town to get pizza.” Oh, Which Way! I was brought back to reality and the fact that she was waiting in Cheshire for me. 
It was a steep descent from the cobble and my feet were feeling it from a long day of hiking. Once it hit the edge of Cheshire, the trail continued on the streets of the cute little village for another third of a mile before reaching the post office. That is where I linked up with my cute little shuttle driver!  We drove to Williamstown, where I will take a zero on Independence Day.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596262,"Tomorrow I’m heading to northern Vermont to hang out with one of Next Step’s cousins and her husband. I met them about 12 years ago or so when our daughter and I were traveling  with my in-laws to Canada to visit my mother-in-laws’s sister. I remember spending a wonderful evening with them and their two older teenaged children. They have a blueberry farm and I can recall being amazed that payment for the blueberries was on the honor system. I just loved that! I am looking forward to spending a few days with them and getting to know them better. They are now Empty Nesters and were so kind when I reached out to them for a place to stay. Just more amazing Trail Angels to add to our growing list! Definitely one of the most incredibly surprising parts of this journey! 
So today, Next Step decided to take a Zero so we could enjoy the day together before I drive up to see them. I will meet him back at the Green Mountain House later this weekend. It was one of our “Must Stay” places that we had heard about when we were planning our hike. 
We hit the continental breakfast at our motel this morning. The owner had put out a beautiful spread of fresh fruits, pastries, bagels, oatmeal and cereal. After breakfast we had to move to a different motel across the street. Ours was overbooked, so I guess hikers are the first to get booted across the street. The owner was very apologetic, but when we went to the other motel, it was even roomier than the one we had been in, so no worries! We’re used to sleeping at a different place every night! At least this was in a real bed. Lol
We got everything settled and Next Step worked on yesterday’s journal entry while I did some stretching. He had heard about a place up the street that might be a good place for him to stop in tomorrow when he actually hikes thru Williamstown, so we decided to stop by there on our way to North Adams to...you guessed it, see a movie! We got to the theater a bit early so we decided to go ahead and do our Walmart run before the movie. As soon as we pulled out of the parking lot we saw a hiker and asked if she needed a ride. She was section hiking and had just finished up Massachusetts and was trying to get back to her car. So she rode with us to Walmart:-) Got back to the theater just in time for the movie, then afterwards, we ran by the store for the last of Next Step’s resupply items. 
We got back to the room to go through the bounce box and food box I had brought with me, to get Next Step ready to head back out. Then we drove up to Pittsfield to eat at a Japanese Steakhouse. Yum! My hiker hunger has finally worn off, so I shared half of mine with him. Lol On the way back to Williamstown we drove up to the top of Greylock Mountain, the highest point on the AT in Massachusetts. There were several people up there waiting to watch the fireworks later tonight. From the top, they would be able to see displays from three different towns. Pretty cool I’m sure, but that would put us up way past hiker midnight, so we just took some pictures and headed back to Williamstown. We saw a porcupine on the side of the road, but he waddled into the brush on the roadside before we could get his picture. But the second one came out not only for a picture, but also for a video. Luckily, he was much more sociable than the first one. Actually, I think it was more like he was oblivious. When he actually realized we were standing there, he took off at hyper waddle speed. Too cute! I had never seen one before, and now I got to see two in one night. A great finish to a perfect day! 
It has been so nice to spend these last few days playing shuttle driver for Next Step. Not exactly how we planned our adventure. But you take what you get and you make the best out of it. Unless I have a miraculous recovery, I’ll head back to KY to hang out with my precious parents next week after we spend the night at the hostel. Just another blessing that I hadn’t planned on, but that I will cherish. Depending on my crazy back, I’ll either come back and hike the 100 mile wildness with Next Step or I’ll just join him for the hike up Katahdin. But either way, we’re finishing this journey together!!! There are no words to describe how proud I am of him and I can’t wait to see him cross the finish line. Keep rockin’ it Next Step! I’m with you in my heart every step of the way!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596422,"Which Way dropped me back in Cheshire and headed to Burlington for a few days. It was 0745 by the time I started walking out of town and began the 8-mile trek to Mount Greylock. It took WW and I 30 minutes to drive to the summit yesterday. It would take me four hours to hike it today. The path was mostly in good condition and the 2,500 foot elevation gain was on an easy to moderate slope. However, the heat and humidity brought on a torrent of sweat that quickly soaked my clothes.
I met another SOBO thru hiker about halfway up. This gal, Freebird, was more sociable than the last SOBO and we stood in the trail chatting for a few minutes. I took her picture and then she took a selfie of the two of us using her camera. Closer to the summit I came across a couple of groups of day hikers. All of them were friendly and seemed happy to meet an AT Thru Hiker.
The 93’ Lighthouse Style Tower marked the summit of Mount Greylock. The tower was built as a War Memorial in 1939. It was lunch time when I reached the summit. As luck would have it, the Bascom Lodge sat less than 50 yards from the trail. I ordered a  BLT and shared a table with a section hiking couple from London. After I finished eating I went outside to retrieve my pack and start hiking again. There was an elderly woman sitting on a bench next to my pack. She also asked if I was thru hiking and offered some words of encouragement. Meeting genuinely friendly people seemed to be the theme of the day. 
The 6-mile descent from Mount Greylock to MA Route 2 (Williamstown/North Adams) was broken up by short climbs up Mount Williams and Mount Prospect Ledge. The latter offered an excellent view of Williamstown. I made it to town at about 3:30 and walked .6 miles west to The Trail House Restaurant. I had stopped by there the day before to check it out and had already decided I would be stopping there for dinner. I am glad I did. I was the only customer at the dining area. A sweet young lady named Nicky took my order and offered to fill up my water bottles. She then brought out a complimentary order of naan bread and some delicious honey butter. Nicky was so friendly and seemed genuinely interested in my hike. I also chatted with the manager, Melissa. The restaurant is new and she wanted it to be hiker friendly. I showed her my AWOL Guidebook and Guthook app and suggested that she get the Trail House listed. There is a grocery store right next door and a new hotel is opening across the street. I told her with the location and great food/service, the hiker grapevine would take care of the rest. Speaking of great food, Nicky brought me the best burger I have eaten so far on the trail. She asked me more about the AT as I ate. I told her that one of the neatest things about the trail was the terrific people we have met along the way. As I was finishing my meal and ready to pay, Nicky came over and told me the meal was on her. She just got added to the endless list of Trail Angels. Melissa offered to have her cook, Dan, give me a lift back to the trail. We had a nice chat on the short ride back to the trail head.
It was close to 5PM when I started hiking again. I hoped to make it 7 more miles to the next shelter. First, I had a 1,500’ climb to the top of the Rock Garden. A steep boulder field was at the top. I was once again drenched in sweat. Moving north along the ridge, I came to a sign indicating that I was entering Vermont. Wow! This point also marked the Southern Terminus of Vermont’s Long Trail, a 273 mile path that runs through the state. The AT shares the first 105 miles in Vermont with the Long Trail (LT).  While the AT is a more popular trail, the older LT was the original older inspiration for a long distance foot path through the Appalachian Mountains. 
A few miles further I finally reached the blue blaze trail leading to the shelter. It was at the 1,600.2 mile mark. It dawned on me that I had just hit an AT milestone trifecta—highest  peak in MA, Vermont, and the 1,600 mile mark. What a day!
With early morning thunderstorms in the forecast, I opted to sleep in the shelter. Four LT Hikers shared the shelter with me. I was confident that the mosquitoes would much prefer the fresh blood.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596463,"When I woke to heavy rain at 0500 I was glad I decided to sleep in the shelter. It was still raining when I hit the trail at 0730 and would continue for the next two hours. The rain created three issues that would define my day—wet rocks, mud, and chafing. 
Vermont is often referred to as “Vermud”. Today I saw just why it carries that label. Most of the mud was avoidable, some was not. In spots,  there was this silty mud that sometimes appeared like solid ground. But when you step on it, you sink straight to the bottom. 
Between the rain and the thick canopy there was not much in the way of views today. I did pass several ponds that were shrouded in fog. Pretty neat to see, but not real picture worthy. There was a partial view atop Harmony Hill. The town of Bennington could be seen below. It was a very steep, rocky, and wet descent from there down to VT Route 9. The rocks were slick and uneven. It was slow and tedious and I had actually worked up a sweat on the way down. My wet shirt and shorts under the hip belt of my pack were causing some major chafing around my waist. It looked like a thick red belt around my hips and low back. This is something I thought I would have to deal with on the trail and am thankful it has not been an issue before now.
There was a nice surprise waiting at a parking lot on the far side of VA 9—TRAIL MAGIC! It was delivered by two guys in a pickup truck. The wife of one of the guys, Brian, has been NOBO since Harpers Ferry. The hiker’s name is Puddles. I caught up with her later in the day and told her what a great job Brian and his friend Dave were doing.
From the parking lot,  I had 10 miles to the Goddard Shelter, my goal for the day. It was a 2,500’ ascent, with a few downhills thrown in to thwart my progress. It was a very painful 10 miles for me. My feet and ankles were throbbing and the rest of my muscles were feeling weak. Finding a position where the pack did not rub on my inflamed hips was causing my back to get sore as well. When I reached the bottom of the final descent I called to check on Which Way. Okay, maybe I was looking for some sympathy too. I had 2.5 miles and 800’ in elevation gain to go and I wasn’t certain I could make it. WW reminded me of something I like to say when I face a climb while running or hiking. “You can work the hill or let the hill work you!” It’s all about having the proper mindset. With that pep talk, I ate a Snickers Bar, downed a Gatorade compliments of the Trail Angels, popped a Vitamin I, lathered on some more Lanicane, and started working the hill. When running up a steep hill,  I like to use imaginary ropes to pull myself to the top. Today I imagined that I had on  cross country skis and used my poles to propel myself forward. It worked! Those last two miles were the easiest of the day for me. 
I arrived at the Goddard Shelter a little past 7PM. The shelter was a very nice structure and there were already several tents along the hillside. So I decided to stay in the shelter with a half dozen other thru hikers. After I soaked my feet in ice cold water, I changed out of my wet clothes and ate dinner. It was windy and cool at the top and the temperature was headed to the 40s. That’s just what I needed to end this day.

",Goddard Shelter,"Jul 06, Fri",21.60
Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596587,"The Caretaker at Stratton Mountain said the temperature dropped down to 41 degrees last night on the 3,940’ summit. With Goddard Shelter sitting at an elevation of 3,568’ it likely got down to 42-43 degrees. It sure felt like it. I needed to wear my pants, socks, and puffy jacket to keep me cozy warm. I didn’t mind a bit though. It meant that the day would be off to a cool start. One young hiker that slept in the same shelter as me only had a sleeping bag liner and no puffy. He said he thought he was going to freeze to death.
Everyone sleeping in the shelter woke up to a big thud at 0500. A hiker that came in around 10PM put his sleep mat on a bench on the hiker porch. You guessed it, he fell off and hit the wooden floor hard enough to make a big sound. He apologized to everyone, packed his stuff up and hit the trail before any of the rest of us were even out of our bags. Nonetheless, most of us got an early start to the day, myself included. I was hiking by 0630, still wearing pants and a Long Sleeve Icebreaker 150 Merino Wool Shirt. It was only .3 miles to the summit of Glasenbury Mountain. It seemed that at every tent spot between the shelter and the summit was occupied. In addition to a bit of an AT bubble, there are an abundance of LT and weekenders. I suspect it will remain that way at least until the AT and LT part ways. 
I climbed the 66 steps up the Glasenbury Fire Tower for an amazing panoramic view. From there it was a bit of a roller coaster for the next several miles. There wasn’t any shortage of rocks, roots and mud along the way. It is hard to find a rhythm with all of obstacles on the path.
A few miles into the hike I ran across some moose scat on the side of the trail. I was surprised to see signs of moose this far south. I kept a close lookout for Bull Winkle around the bogs the rest of the day. No other signs of moose, but I did come across several turkey. They flew/ran just out of sight and I could hear one clucking, but another hiker came along before they had a chance to come back my way. By the way, I forgot to mention that I jumped a grouse yesterday. He flew up about 30’ behind me then walked out of sight.
About 12 miles into the hike the trail started a 1,700’ climb to the summit of Stratton Mountain. However, the ascent was spread over 3.8 miles and the terrain was some of the best all day. Another fire tower marked the top of Stratton Mountain. The real significance of the summit is that it is where Benton MacKay was inspired to propose a continuously marked trail along the crest of the Appalachian Mountains. McKay wrote about his vision in an article that appeared in the Journal of the American Institute of Architects in 1921.
MacKaye, who was from Massachusetts, sometimes took long walks in the mountains of Vermont. He claimed that the idea for the A.T. was born one day when he was sitting in a tree atop Stratton Mountain. The first section of the trail was constructed in Harriman State Park in New York in 1922; the final section was added in Maine in 1937. MacKaye died in 1975, but not before his dream became a thing. Better yet, he left behind a thing that millions of other people can dream about.
I climbed the tower that rose above the trees and surveyed the mountains, lakes, and ponds that surrounded the area. Stratton Pond, my destination for the day, sat three trail miles to the northwest of the tower. Farther north were Bromley Mountain, Styles Peak, and Millington Peak. I sketched a mental overlay of the trail across those peaks and beyond and was satisfied that my dream was still alive.
I made the 3.0 mile hike to the Stratton Pond Shelter in a little more than an hour. The spacious shelter comfortably accommodates 16 hikers. I claimed a bottom bunk and headed down to the pond with my pack. I passed the Care Taker on the way to the pond and paid the $5 fee for staying at the shelter. The fee covers two other pay-to-stay spots in Vermont. 
After retrieving water from a spring that feeds the pond, I found a comfy spot to  enjoy a cup of hot tea and eat my dinner. I stayed at that spot until the sun set beyond the other side of the pond. I am dreaming my dream until my dream becomes a thing. What is your dream? Keep on dreaming...

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596685,"With temperatures only falling into the low 50s, I slept comfortably last night. Most of us in the full shelter were up and about by 0500. Since I slept through the night for a change, I didn’t finish yesterday’s journal entry until around 0600. However, I was on the trail by 0700 and it would be a relatively short walk to VT 11/30, where I would catch a ride to Manchester Center. Which Way was driving down from Burlington to meet me, but she didn’t expect to arrive before 1PM. The trail took me back down to and around the north side of Stratton Pond. As I was approaching the pond, the caretaker was headed up. He told me that an older hiker showed up yesterday without a sleeping bag or any cold weather gear. The caretaker loaned the man a sleeping bag and his puffy jacket to stay warm through the night. However, the hiker did not return the jacket. The caretaker told me the hiker was headed northbound and asked me to keep an eye out for him. I asked him the mans name and the color of his puffy. He replied that his name was Tom and it was a blue Patagonia jacket. Then I remembered seeing Tom standing outside the shelter early this morning wearing the blue puffy. He left camp at least an hour before me, announcing to no one in particular that he had blisters and would be moving slow today. 
For the first six miles of the hike the trail followed a mostly gentle path over easy terrain. There were more miles of rock free and root free trail today, than in the previous 40+ miles traveled in Vermont thus far. Able to keep my head up more, I was constantly surveying my surroundings in search of wildlife. However, there was none to be seen today. So, I just took in the ocean of green that surrounded me. Since entering Vermont the trail has been passing through the Green Mountain National Forest. The Green Mountain Range runs primarily south to north and extends approximately 250 miles from the border with Massachusetts to the border with Quebec, Canada. The verdant  forest of the Green Mountains is thickly covered with a variety of plants and trees. The forest floor is a conglomerate of small moss covered boulders, ferns, broad leaf plants and a variety of shrubs and tiny wildflowers. I am also seeing more mushrooms and other fungi in Vermont than any other state. There are a variety of trees. Today the forest was replete with tall Beech, Hickory, Maple, and Spruce trees. 
About 90 minutes into my hike I came upon a pack sitting on the side of the trail. There was a stream below the  path and a hiker collecting water to filter. I thought it might be the man with the caretaker’s puffy, so I called out, “Tom.” When Tom looked my way, I confirmed with him that he had stayed at the Stratton Pond Shelter last night. He responded in the affirmative, so I asked him if he had accidentally taken the Caretaker”s  jacket. After a pause he said that he had. I asked him to give it to me so that I could deliver it to the Green Mountains Trail Club HQs. He did. Tom seemed a bit disoriented so I asked him if he was doing okay and if he needed anything. He said he was fine, so I moved on.
About six miles into the hike the trail turned onto a forest road. It followed the road for about a half mile, where the AT and a blue blaze trail intersected. I turned left on the blue blaze and hiked about 100 yards to Prospect Rock. The high ledge over the town of Manchester provided a great view of the town and Mount Equinox. 
Only four miles remained to VT 30/11. Although the elevation profile was still fairly flat, the terrain was a little more tedious from the first seven miles of the hike. Also, the day was warming up and I  was just not feeling it today. Anyway, I crossed VT 30/11 a little after 1200. Meanwhile, Which Way was enroute from Burlington and closing in fast. The original plan was to meet her at the Green Mountain House Hostel. But, I decided that the shower would have to wait. When I got to the busy highway, I crossed the road and stuck my thumb out. About 40 cars later, a man in a truck pulled over and picked me up. I couldn’t help but think that if WW had been with me I would have caught a ride earlier. Anyway, the friendly man named Keth gave me a ride to town, giving me a lowdown on the best eateries. Meanwhile, I was on the phone with WW, who had just arrived in town. I told her where we were going and she pulled over at a gas station to plug it into her GPS. I looked out my side window and just as a cute little gal was pulling out of a service station. It was WW. How could I miss that?!? I got on the phone and told her to follow the truck in front of her to the pizzeria. 
It was great to see WW and we caught up on her little excursion to Burlington as I stuffed my face with pizza. Afterward, we drove to the Green Mountain House. You may remember that we met the proprietor, Jeff, on Day 9, way back in GA. WWs knees and blisters were acting up that day, so I raced ahead to the highway to see if I could hitch a ride to the Top of Georgia Hostel. Jeff was in the area for the AT kickoff down at Amicalola Falls. He was working his way north and had stopped at the parking area and was getting ready for a day hike. Anyway, he graciously gave us a ride to the TOG and told me that he was running a hostel of his own up in Vermont. I told him we would see him there. I’m glad we did, because he has the nicest hostel we have visited so far. Jeff, AT Class of 2006, actually  lives in Cleveland. He wanted to open a hostel after his hike.
Eventually he found this lovely house in Manchester Center. The rest is history. Jeff (and usually his wife Regina) come here from Cleveland four months out of the year to open the house to hikers. Jeff actually stays in a renovated barn next to the big house. It is the only hostel on the AT that I know of where the owner lives in the barn and the hikers get the house. And the hikers absolutely have run of the house here. The kitchen and living room are fully equipped and open to hikers. No additional charge for laundry, pancakes, eggs, coffee and your first soda. The freezer is stocked with pints of Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream for just one dollar. So many other details make this place amazing. He even had an Army flag flying for me! And WW said this if the first place we’ve stayed that had fabric softener sheets. She loved that! Jeff has a helper named Duffy who does a great job of keeping the place spic and span clean and making sure hikers have everything they need. Jeff says this is just a hobby for him. It is certainly a labor of love.
Looking forward to a ZERO in beautiful Manchester Center with with my sweet little WW tomorrow.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596750,"Next Step and I had set our alarms for 0645 even though it was a zero day. The night before, we had told the other hikers staying in the hostel that we would make some sausage, bacon, grits and fruit salad to go with the pancakes for breakfast. Unfortunately, one of the hikers missed the memo, and had already gotten up and made a bunch of pancakes by the time we got down to the kitchen and most everyone had already eaten. We cooked most of it up anyway and fed a few late risers. Nearly all of the other hikers had gotten back to the trail by 0830 but we hung around so Next Step could finish the journal entry. We weren’t sure when we would be able to check into the Palmer House, where we planned to spend the night. We really enjoyed our stay at Green Mountain House, especially chatting with Jeff, the owner, and the other hikers. 
Fortunately when we arrived at the Palmer House, our room was ready for an early check in. This is a beautiful mountain resort complete with croquet, and other lawn games, a pool, a nine hole golf course and even a stocked trout pond for fishing! What an amazing place to spend on our Zero day! We got most of our stuff unloaded and then headed back to town for some delicious tacos. We walked around Manchester Center for a bit and found Next Step a new, smaller cook pot at the local outfitters. Of course by then, Next Step was ready for ice cream so we made a beeline to the nearest Ben & Jerry’s. The foursome right in front of us was ordering the “Vermonster” which was literally a gallon size bucket filled with ice cream, waffle cones, chocolate sauce, berries, whipping cream and nuts for $40. If I had still been hiking I definitely think Next Step and I could have easily polished  off one of those!!! 
Next stop was the grocery store to get a few resupply items and then over to the post office to grab a couple of boxes. We went back to the motel and were thinking about a nap, but the shuffle board court was calling our name. Next Step schooled me, but it is a game for the elderly, so that wasn’t  surprising. Lol We found some Adirondack chairs in the shade and just relaxed for a couple of hours. It’s really hard to beat the summertime  in Vermont on a day like today - perfect temperatures and a gentle breeze to cure what ails you! 
However, after also losing at Ladder Ball, Corn Hole and Croquet, I’m thinking I might need to change the title of today’s journal entry!!! If Next Step is trying to get me to hang out with him a bit longer, he has a terrible way of showing it!! Lol
We had to sort through med boxes, food boxes and bounce boxes to figure out what I am mailing on up the trail and what is going back to KY with me. When we looked up and it was already after 1900! Yikes! Better get to supper as hiker midnight was fast approaching! 
I’m definitely feeling more at peace as I prepare for my trip back home tomorrow. This just wasn’t my time to do the entire trail. But I would rather have tried and not have finished than to not have tried at all. Some things are just beyond our control and I wouldn’t trade anything for this journey with my Next Step.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596831,"We ended a wonderful stay at the Palmer House over breakfast. From there, Which Way drove me to the trailhead and we once again parted ways. Seeing her again was a real boost for me and, as usual, it was hard to let her go. But, I know she will be with me in spirit for the rest of the journey and we will be together again soon.
I also know that I am on the easy end of this separation. She so longs to be hiking with me and it torments me to think about how she must feel to know that the AT experience is passing her by with every mile I walk. But, if you knew Which Way like I do,  you would realize that it is hard to find someone as unselfish as her. So, seeing me move on without her is an easier burden for her to bear than not seeing me fulfill a lifetime dream. I have come to realize that the two main ingredients needed to successfully complete a thru hike of the AT are determination and luck. No one would dare question her determination. She endured so much in hiking over 1,000 miles of the AT. It was a huge accomplishment for her to make it as far as she did considering the pain she was in, especially in the last couple of weeks. For her to come back out and try to jump back into it (although she clearly hadn’t fully healed), shows just how much she wanted to finish this together.  I got a text from a friend today that I think best sums up her grit and accomplishment. It read “The ""MAX"" effort that Which Way (Tuffy) has put forth only confirms my nickname for her. The number of miles she hiked boggles my brain.  Wow, just wow.”
Which Way and I have faith that that there is a reason for everything. I know that the Lord has a different plan for her right now and she is where she needs to be. I hope the same is true for me.
Which Way stood at the trail head as I disappeared into the woods. As is our tradition, we both held one hand high, flashing the “I love you” sign until we were out of each other’s sight. WW is driving back to Kentucky. She stopped at the post office on her way out of town to mail me a resupply box. Yes, I now have the best trail support crew a hiker could ask for. She will be stopping in Carlisle, PA to stay overnight with our good friends turned Trail Angels. Please pray for safe travels.
It was a steady 1,500’ climb up Bromley Mountain. I paused at the Bromley Shelter to stretch and grab a snack on the way up. As I was leaving the shelter Epic came racing up and we hiked to the top together. The final half mile was up a ski slope. At the top was a ski lift.
After descending Bromley Mountain, for about 1.5 miles the trail climbed another 1,000’ to Styles Peak. The two biggest climbs of the day were behind me before noon. On the way up Styles a Swainson’s Thrush flew right below my feet. It had built a nest in a cup of moss beneath a rock. Inside the nest were four pale green-blue eggs that are finely spotted with light brown in a well-built cup. I walked about 15 yards up the trail and waited for about 5 minutes in hopes that Mama bird would fly back to the nest and I could sneak down for a picture. She was satisfied just standing guard from the tree above the nest. I also came across two snakes and several lizards and newts today. More signs of moose too, but still no sightings. There was an outcropping with a nice view atop Styles Peak. I decided to stop there for lunch and to soak in some rays. 
Next came Peru Peak, followed by Griffith Lake, and then Baker Peak. The trail also passed through three wilderness areas today.  It was a short, but fun climb to the top of Baker Peak. The trail worked its way up a granite rock formation that culminated in an open ledge. There was a great view to the west of the Tatonic Mountain Range, specifically Dorset Peak. Three nice young women who I ran into before my Zero day were soaking in the rays and the views at the top. They are middle school teachers from Tennessee who are hiking the Long Trail. Thunderstorms were forecast for the afternoon. I had good signal from the top so I checked the weather. There was a Severe Weather Alert and the radar showed a big red blob headed our way. I told the others that bad weather was moving in and that the top of this rocky peak would not be a good place to be when it hit. About that time we heard a rumble of thunder and I could see dark clouds forming to the north. The next shelter was 1.5 miles down the other side of Baker Peak. We all put our pack covers on and started down the mountain. I ran most of the way, catching up to another female hiker just before the shelter. I was the first to arrive at the Lost Pond Shelter. It was empty when I arrived. The hiker I had just passed came in a minute later. The three hikers I saw at the top of the mountain came in about 10 minutes later. One other hiker came in just behind them. We all made it just before the storm hit. It rained hard and lightning was in the air for about 45 minutes. I went ahead and ate my dinner meal as the storm passed. The others followed suit. When the rain let up I packed up and hit the trail again. The other hikers were still contemplating whether to stay put for the night or move on.
I ended up hiking another five miles to the Little Rock Pond Shelter. I arrived a little before dark and just before the rain picked up again. I ended up bunking in the roomy double-decker shelter. There were a 1/2 dozen other hikers in the shelter. A noisy group of kids were tented close by. I hope they know about hiker midnight.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596929,"I was the first hiker at the shelter to hit the trail. Still,  0730 felt like a late start. The path hugged the east bank of the Little Rock Pond for about a half mile. A light fog hung over the cool water. No moose going for an early morning swim today. After leaving the pond it was a steady climb for the next couple of miles. There were lots of rocks and roots and they were still wet from the rain. I quickly worked up a sweat in the thick air.  It was slow going over a series of ups and downs. Getting traction and finding a rhythm were difficult. Plus, I just felt a little sluggish. 
The trail eventually rose to a manmade Rock Garden (cairns). From there the trail started a long descent to Bully Brook and then across Russell Road. Then came the climb up Bear Mountain. The 1,200’ over 1.8 miles took a toll on me. My Dad once said, “Some days you get the bear and some days the bear gets you.” Well this bear certainly got the best of me today. It’s all good training though. The trail started to mellow a bit as I came down Bear mountain and through Patch Hollow. It was neary 2PM when I stopped at the Minerva Hichey Shelter to eat lunch. I had only covered 10 miles to that point. There was a short climb after the shelter. I got cell signal towards the top so I called to check on WW.  Between the lunch break and hearing WW’s voice, I was finally starting to find my groove. It helped that the trail softened considerably and the sun had dried any remaining rock obstacles. The trail started a long descent to Clarendon Gorge. A suspension bridge at the bottom of the gorge crossed over the Mill River.
It was a bit of a scramble out of the gorge. However,  a cool north breeze was being channeled through the canyon walls. Ahhh, the trail provides. The high point coming out of the canyon is called Beacon Hill. Yes, there is a beacon (FAA signal tower) on top of the hill. After reaching the top, I descended about 400’, crossing a couple of gravel roads and streams. The last road/stream crossing was the Cold River Road. From there it was an easy three mile push to the shelter. The trail followed the sect moving Sergeant Brook, gaining 600’ in elevation. For the most part the trail was smooth, just what the feet need after 10 hours of hiking. On the way up I passed a sign  on a tree that indicated that it was 500 miles to Katahdin. Wow! It seems so long ago when WW and I reached the 500 mile mark from Springer Mtn. Closing in, but still a lot of challenging hiking in front of me. At least 200-300 of the remaining miles will likely be the hardest on the AT. 
I reached the shelter at 1830 and saw no one I knew. Tent sites were scattered all around the area. I found a secluded spot and set up camp. This is the first time in a while that I set up the tent. As I pitched the tent, it dawned on me why I had been subconsciously opting for the less cozy shelter lately. WW loved sleeping in the tent and we always set it up together. It makes me a little sad every time I do it on my own. 
The day got off to a sluggish start, but the second half went well. Looking forward to a good night’s sleep. I will need it for the climb over Killington Peak in the morning.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597015,"At an elevation of 4,235 feet, Killington Peak is the second highest point in the state of Vermont. It is the home of the largest ski resort in the northeast. It is also an AT milestone I have long looked forward to hiking. Today that dream became a thing.
My hike started at 0730 on a cool sunny day. It was only 4.5 miles to the Cooper Lodge Shelter, which is located just below the top of Killington. “The Peak” Restaurant is located just .3 miles from the Cooper Lodge. Since the restaurant didn’t open until 1000 I was in no hurry to get there. After an excellent night’s sleep in my tent I felt good right from the beginning today. The 2,000’ climb was on a fairly even grade on mostly good terrain. It was the kind of start that gently awakened my leg muscles and allowed me to get into a good rhythm.
With the exception of the sound of my own breathing, the silence of the forest was calming. I felt good about feeling good and just took in my surroundings. I just love taking in the sights and subtle sounds as the green tunnel passes me by. Things as simple as the diversity in the texture and color of moss on rocks and logs leaves me in awe. I’m in a good place in my wonderment. The green tunnel was so thick today that there was no glimpse of Killington until I was standing on the summit. For days I have been able to view it from afar from various vistas and fire towers. Today I was part of the mountain, hidden under its canopy, among its lush undergrowth.
I arrived at the Cooper Lodge Shelter just before 1000. A couple of other hikers were already there, getting ready to  take the blue blaze to the top. It was another 350’ in elevation gain to the top. We all dropped our packs and started the short, but extremely steep climb to the peak. I personally classify an elevation gain of 1,000’ per mile (100’/.1 mile) as steep. It is a 1:1 ration. A 1:2 ratio (500’/mile) is a moderate climb. The short scramble up to Killington Peak was nearly 2:1 (extremely steep) ratio. One of the other hikers commented that this is what a good portion of the White Mountains in New Hampshire is like. It’s all good training. With no packs to weigh us down, we were at the top in under 5 minutes. Just after I pulled myself over the final rock, jaw dropping views in every direction came into sight. For the first time I could see the challenge that lie ahead to north and east.
The ski lodge/food court are located another tenth of a mile down the other side of the mountain. I walked down some stairs and past a operating gondola lift that was bringing tourists to the top. The lodge was spacious and comfy. In no hurry to get lunch, I started with a cup of coffee to sip on as I uploaded pictures from yesterday’s hike. I eventually got around to ordering a pricey, yet tasty chicken wrap. 
Two hours passed from the time I arrived at the shelter below the summit until I started hiking again. I could get used to this pace. The hike off of Killington was as easy as the hike up. The weather-worn spruce trees were eventually replaced with tall hickory, oak, beech, and maple trees. The green forest floor was spacious under the old growth trees. After several miles the trail came to Maine Junction. This marks the spot where the Long Trail splits off to the north to Canada. The AT will travel generally eastward from here until crossing into New Hampshire. I will miss the fresh and enthusiastic LT Hikers. I must admit that their awe of AT Thru Hikers was good for the ego—lol.
Towards the end of the hike I hit a small section of trail that was very soft and unmarked. It was apparent that it had just been rerouted. A little further down the trail I ran into a group of five trail maintainers from the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps (VYCC). We chatted for a few minutes and I thanked them for their hard work. 
Soon after leaving the VYCC I entered the Gifford Woods State Park. There were tent sites there and a coin shower. If I had seen the park office I might have stayed. Instead, I called the Killington Motel as soon as I departed the campgrounds and crossed over VT 100. I inquired about their room rate. The price was right. Then I asked  if I could get a shuttle from/to the trail. The owner arrived 5 minutes later to pick me up. 90 minutes later I was showered and enjoying pizza and salad in my room. A good ending to a perfect day!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597093,"Breakfast was served st 0700 and I arrived fashionably late at 0701.  Steve, the owner of the motel, had a nice spread of fruits, muffins, cereal, and cheese. He also made blueberry pancakes to order.
The lobby of the motel was cluttered with 50lb bags of coffee beans from India, Africa, and Central America. There were also several dozen smaller labeled bags of roasted coffee and a couple of scales on a table. I asked Steve the obvious question, “Are you in the mail order coffee business?” The answer came back, “Yes”.  We discussed his business as I was enjoying a cup of freshly roasted and brewed Sumatran Coffee. It was very tasty, so I placed an order for a 3lb bag ($10) to send to my daughter. I usually mail order my beans when I’m not hiking. I may have found a new supplier. 
Steve gave me a lift back to the trail and I was hiking by 0800. I was feeling good after coming off a great night’s sleep and mega carb load. Within a half mile the trail reached Kent Pond, skirting the south shore for another half mile. A hotel that specializes in weddings was nestled on the east end of the pond. A little further along,  the path crossed a road and passed below Thundering Falls. Although the falls were scenic, they would have been more spectacular after a heavy rain. The trail continued along a boardwalk after the falls. From the boardwalk was a clear view of Quimbly Mountain, the first climb of the day. It was a 1,300’ ascent over 1.5 miles, making it a very steep climb. However, the surface was good here. That would hold true for most of the day. Before the climb started to increase in grade, I came over a hump and saw a turkey about 20 yards to my front. It was forging for food next to the trail. Before I could get my camera out,  the turkey took off. A half dozen others would follow. As I was waiting to see if the turkey might come back, a couple of NOBOs passed by. I would play leap frog with them and 3 other Canadian hikers the rest of the day.
After working up a good sweat going up Quimbly I was looking for spot to take a snack break. I found a perfect rock to sit on while crossing under some power lines. It was breezy here and it made a great observation point for Pico Slopes. Less drastic ups and downs continued until lunch. As I hiked along,  about a half dozen SOBO thru hikers passed by. I had a short conversation with each of them. I stopped at a stream for water and found another good spot to break for lunch—two slices of pizza I saved from last night (trust me, it was a sacrifice). 
After lunch the trail continued to descend to Stormy Brook, before rising 800’ over 1.5 miles. About 14 miles into the hike the trail intersected with a blue blaze. The .2 mile side trail traveled up a old rocky road to a spot called “The Lookout.” It is a very nice enclosed cabin with an observation deck on the roof. I stopped here for dinner and to write up the journal entry. I was the first to arrive at the lookout. The three Canadians came up the hill about 5 minutes later. Three other hikers showed up within an hour. I had planned to go to the next shelter (about 2 miles down hill), but was contemplating staying put. The only issue was that I was out of water and there was none here. Say what, as I was typing the last sentence one of the Canadian Hikers asked if anyone needed water. He hauled some extra up the mountain. The trail provides. Looks like I’m staying put!

Needless to say, I was up early and hiking by 0600. No need to climb to the observation deck for the sunrise, as thick grey clouds were stacking up along the eastern mountain ranges.
The clouds hung around most of the day with light showers in morning and a brief period of heavier rain later in the afternoon. The comfort factor ranged from warm and sticky to cool and breezy. As you might gather from the elevation and grade data, there were lots of ups and downs today. None of the climbs or descents were too remarkable on their own, but there were several short steep climbs that added up. Most of the hike was a series of steep ascent, a meadow, a descent, a pasture and a road crossing. Rinse and repeat. Other than the steep climbs and some overgrown meadows, trail conditions were perfect today. There were very few roots to deal with, and even less rocks. Most of the trail was either covered in leaf-mulch or pine straw. Mostof the lush undergrowth was missing today as well.
The trail resembled a lot of what I remember from the southern states. Except that there is plenty of canopy now. Large patches of raspberries atop most of the hills offered a few tasty treats for the picking. Speaking of food, lately I have been re-supplying with three days worth of food and then stretching it to 5-7 days (supplementing as needed). I am able to stretch it out by dropping into a deli, staying at a hostel, etc. My last re-supply was in Manchester Center. I blew through the bulk of the food in the first two days, but have been stringing the last day out since hitting the Peak Lodge atop Killington. There were two farmer’s markets along the route today. I planned to stop at the Cloudland Market for lunch and get some snacks to go. The market sits less than a 1/4 mile off one of the roads that the AT crossed today. It would come about 13 miles into the hike. As it turned out, I did not need to stop at the market. A little over 10 miles into the hike the trail crossed a stream and then a road. What’s that I see? Could it be? When I saw the bucket on the far side of the stream I tried not to get my hopes up. More often than not, a cooler or other cache in the middle of the woods are only filled with empty cans by the time I get to it. Not this time. There were about a half dozen cool sodas in the bucket marked “Share The Magic”. I downed a Sure Fine Lemon Lime, left the empty can in a second bucket, and stepped out on the road. I was thinking that the soda was just what I needed to get me up and over the next climb to the market.
 Four hikers were walking up the road just as I was crossing. I decided to wait for them to get to the trailhead before moving on. They had just come from a farm house 100yds down the road. The house was just recently bought and occupied by a young couple who completed a SOBO Thru Hike in 2016. They had set up their back porch for hikers to relax and they had a refrigerator stocked with goodies for sale. I stashed my pack in the tree line on the far side of the road and made my way down to Loon and Firefly’s Place. I kicked off my shoes and grabbed a couple of hard boiled eggs from the fridge. That would go perfectly with the cheese I had left in my food bag. For dessert I had a homemade chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich and a Starbucks Mocha Frap to wash it down. Loon was busy mowing the grass and Firefly was in and out looking in on their baby (seems they have been busy since finishing their hike). I grabbed a Snickers Bar and Gatorade for the road and put some money  in the change box. Thanks Loon and Firefly! That should do me until New Hampshire. 
As I was walking back up the road I passed an open field with two turkey hens. When I stepped into the field to get a pic,  6-10 chicks took to the air headed for the tree line. It was either that or a pheasant that happened to be laying low in the same field. I got a pic, but the resolution is not great.
After crossing several more hills, fields, roads, and streams the trail hit a road that crossed the White River and began to pass through the small town of West Hartford, VT. The town was hit hard by flooding from Hurricane Irene in 2011 and has yet to fully recover. Just across the bridge was a barn with an AT symbol. Next to the barn was a house. It is the home of the Randy and Barb Hart, friends of the AT. Randy was sitting on the porch and gave me a hoot. I walked over his way and he offered me some Italian Sausage and Peppers, some Macaroni Salad, bread,  and something to drink. Turns out they also let hikers stay in the barn (converted into an apartment of sorts). Looks like I’m staying here tonight. Oh, Barb just brought out Cup Cakes and fresh coffee. Done deal. Magic in the air on the AT today.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597297,"You know your day is off to a good start when you see a Bald Eagle in flight before 0600. It happened as I was sitting on the Hart’s porch chatting with Randy and eating breakfast. Just as I was finishing off my bagel Randy pointed in the direction of the White River. The majestic bird came soaring down the river, undoubtedly in search of fresh trout for breakfast. Pretty cool!
It was only a 10 mile walk to today’s  destination of Hanover, NH. Two-thirds of the elevation gain were behind me in the first 3 miles of the hike. As has been the case lately, the trail was very soft for most of the hike. By 0945 I reached the outskirts of Norwich, VT. The trail followed Elm Street and then Main Street through the trail friendly town. Elm St. was lined with houses sitting on spacious lots. One of the first houses I hiked past had a cooler full of Cokes for hikers. A couple of SOBOs were reclined in chairs enjoying the refreshments. I grabbed one for the road just as another hiker named Dasha was jogging down the road, without her pack. She was out for three days and her hike was ending in Hanover. She wanted to make it before 1100 so she could watch the World Cup. I saw her a couple of times yesterday and she mentioned that she did not have a tent. She ended up staying at the shelter south of West Hartford last night. She set out at 0430 and stashed her pack at the first road crossing she came to. She would retrieve it after the game. Anyway, she realized she was going to make it on time and we walked the rest of the way together. The AT continued on the road for the final 2+ miles of the hike. It crossed under I-91 and then over the Connecticut River. At the midpoint of the bridge was an engraved stone marking the VT/NH border. Say what? The penultimate state. Oh happy day!
The trail continued along the road, entering the town of Hanover, a quintessential New England town and home to Dartmouth College. I had made arrangements to stay with a “Friend of the AT”. I made contact with the person from a list of people who volunteer to take in hikers. Fran is a retired MD of Internal and Palliative Care. She was attending a conference on campus when I arrived and would link up with me when they broke for lunch. No problem. I dove into the Skinny Pancake for a delicious breakfast Slammy and some crepe dessert thingy. All yummy! I popped over to the adjacent pub to say a quick hello to some fellow hikers who were watching the World Cup. Then I met Fran street side and we walked to her car.
She was kind enough to take me to her place for a quick shower and laundry during her break. I had given Epic her number and he made arrangements to stay there as well. He showed up the night before and was just getting up when I arrived. Fran took us both back to town when she returned to her conference. Being that it is National Ice Cream Day (thanks for the heads up Dick) we went and grabbed some Gelato (close enough). From there I made my way to Lou’s Bakery for a cup of coffee. They were also giving out free pasties to hikers (I opted for the Maple Twist). The server was exceptionally sweet and attentive. The original owner of the iconic bakery (Lou) has passed on. The new owner is an ex-Marine (I know, once a Marine...) who attended Tucks School of Business at Dartmouth. We talked about the trail and Dartmouth’s “Next Step” program for professionals looking to transition into the business realm. He kept shoving more free complimentary pasties my way until the doors closed at 3PM. In fact, I was still there after closing. Not wanting to wear out my welcome, I paid for my cup of coffee and hit the street. The owner wrote down his contact info for me as I was headed for the door. What a great place in a great town. 
I worked my way up to campus and hung out at “The Green” until Fran texted. I told her earlier in the day that I wanted to treat her to dinner as a token of my appreciation for her hospitality. First, she ran Epic and I by the Co-op to pick up some re-supply items. We then ran by her place to put things away before returning to Murphy’s Pub for a burger. Back at her place now winding down and getting ready for my first few days of hiking in New Hampshire. I’m in a penultimate STATE of mind.
In other words, I’m PUMPED!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597384,"Vermont is in the review mirror, but it’s not too late to give props to those who help to maintain the AT through the state. A big shout out to the National Park Service, Forestry Service, the Green Mountain Club, the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps, and other organizations and volunteers who manage the AT/LT and shelters for thousands of hikers to enjoy every year. 
Now my sights are set on the great State of New Hampshire, specifically the White Mountains. It will a three day hike before I hit the Whites. It could be done in two days, but I want to be as fresh as possible going into the trek over what should be the biggest challenge to date. 
The terrain and scenery on today’s hike was similar to that of the last 50 miles or so of Vermont. The climbs did get a little steeper. The limited  views of distant mountains are also getting much more spectacular. Fran dropped me  back on the trail (in town) for a 0700 start. The first of  three climbs today was up to  Velvet Rocks. I didn’t see any velvet on the Rocks. On the way up I passed a SOBO rushing to get to town. She told me it was the first southbound town that the trail actually passes through. That means it was my last. I hadn’t thought about that until she said something. I gave her Fran’s number to call in the event she needed a place to stay and wished her well. After passing over Velvet Rocks there were several miles of ups, downs, fields, and road crossings. About 9 miles into the hike I came to Mink Brook, where I stopped for water and lunch. Up until this point I had only seen the one hiker. But that changed as 6-8 NOBOs and about as many SOBOs converged on one of the few water sources for the day. Several of the NOBOs started the trail around the 20th of February. Epic also came by hiking south. He has a package coming to Hanover today. Fran gave him a ride 17 AT miles north and he is hiking back to town so he can get the package.
The biggest climb of the day was a 1,200’ ascent up Moose Mountain. No, I didn’t see any Moose on the mountain. On the descent from Moose Mtn a SOBO passed by and said there was no water to the north until Grant Brook. This was not good news, as the Brook was about 2.5 miles past the shelter where I was planning to stop for the night. 
The final climb was 1,000’ up to Holts Ledge. I took my last drink of water from my hydration bladder as I neared the top. I had about a cup of Gatorade left in a plastic bottle. It was still a mile to the shelter and over three miles to the Brook. Two pairs of hikers were on the ledge making arrangements to stay at Lyme. Storms are forecast to move in tonight and tomorrow morning and they didn’t want to get caught in one on Smarts Mtn (the first big climb tomorrow). It looks to me that the most severe weather is not moving in until late morning. I should be able to at least make it to the top by the time serious weather moves in. There is an Old Cabin converted to a shelter at the top. Worst case I’ll just hunker down there until the storms pass. 
About halfway down to the side trail leading to the shelter the trail passed through a small draw. What’s this? A trickle of water was flowing out of the mountain and pooling up a bit just above the  footbridge. I scooped 2 liters into the dirty bag and continued to the shelter. Three other hikers were already at the shelter when I arrived. As it turns out, there was also a spring of pooling water just below the shelter.
I occupied a spot inside the shelter with three other hikers and took care of business. It’s way past dark now and some bird or something is making a sick sound. I hope it moves on soon. A breeze is picking up. I plan to get up early and check the weather. I’ll decide how to approach tomorrow when I see how things are shaping up. Someone pinch me, I’m dreaming that I am hiking the AT in New Hampshire!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597474,"The rain never came last night, but it was on the way. There was a 50 percent chance at 0700 and the odds continued to grow throughout the morning. I was up before daylight and hiking by 0600. Two other NOBOs, Grumpy and Sterling, came out of the shelter right behind me. The first water source was located  3 miles up the trail. The three of us all converged at the stream before taking on the big climb of the day—Smart’s Mountain. The rain came just as we were finishing up. The higher I climbed, the harder it rained. At some point my shirt stopped being drenched with sweat and started being soaked with rain. The initial climb was about 1,200’ up Lambert’s Ridge, the arm of Smart’s Mountain. The final mile along the ridge ducked in and out of an open rocky ledge. Marble and Quartz veins ran through the granite slab. This created seams and crevices that made the footing good. However, I don’t think I would have wanted to hike down it it the rain. The rain let up a little as I worked my way up the ridge, opening up a glimpse of the fire tower at the summit of Smart’s Mtn. From there, the grade moderated as the trail hooked around to the base of the final ascent. The final push to the top rose 900’ over one mile. One SOBO met me at the bottom of the climb using expletives to describe how slick the rocks were above me. Some spots had steep stone steps. One especially steep part has rebar rungs bolted into the granite. In other places, I just had to navigate through and around the slick spots. I didn’t find it overly difficult. 
At the summit is a fire tower and an old warden’s cabin that has been converted to a shelter. The rain started picking up again just as I hit the top. Bypassing the tower, I made a beeline for the cabin. Sterling was already there. Grumpy arrived about 5 minutes later. I stripped off my wet clothes and hung everything to dry (sort of) on the porch. All I was wearing was my rain jacket and a bandanna tucked in my undershorts. It was only 1000 and the day’s hike was half done. 
The rain was coming down hard now, as thunder and a couple of flashes of lightning joined in the chorus. I decided that instead of just sitting there in my loin cloth, I should go ahead and have an early lunch. I heated up some water for hot tea to go with my salami, bacon, and habanero cheddar cheese sandwich. After lunch and an attempt to start typing up the journal for the day, the sleep monster hit me. All three of us laid our ground cover (for tent) out on the floor of the cabin. Just as we got comfy, silence. The rain stopped. 10 minutes later we all had our wet clothes back on and were making a dash for the next shelter. 
It was a long and muddy descent down the mountain. The trail dropped 1,800’ over the next four miles. There were busted up foot boards over some of the boggiest spots. At one point my foot slipped off the side of a board and I sunk to my knee in mud and silt. Gotta be more careful.
The last couple of miles of the hike was to the Hexacuba Shelter, located about half way up Mount Cube. A light rain returned as I trudged up the hill. There were a few huge marble slabs that were quite slick. I stopped to fill up my water bag in a ravine located next to the side trail leading to the shelter. Like yesterday, the side trail continued 1/4 mile (uphill) before coming to the Hecacuba Shelter. As the name suggests, it is a 6-sided shelter. I was eating dinner by 4PM and napping by 5. More rain and more hikers came. Tent sites are limited here, so 10 of us ended up in the shelter. I haven’t felt this cozy since the Smokies.
The rain should end tonight. Behind it is some cooler and drier weather. Hopefully we got enough of the wet stuff to replenish the drying streams. It’s just getting dark and there is snoring all around me. I think I’ll try to join in the chorus!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597601,"Surprisingly, I slept well in the overfilled shelter. Wake up time was staggered among hikers, so there was plenty of room to maneuver in the morning. One hiker was up and at it at 0430 and hiking by 0500. Most of the other hikers were stirring when I hit the trail at 0600. My clothes and shoes were still damp when I faced the cool day. Fortunately, the first two miles was to the top of Mount Cube The first part of the hike to the top was in thick vegetation. The rocks under the canopy were still wet from the rain, making for slow going. Closer to the top the rock surface was exposed and much drier. This was a good thing since the slope was also much steeper. At Quartzite Ledges I paused to looked over my shoulder to catch a view to the southwest. The clouds were racing up the mountain though. By the time I hiked the last 3/4 of a mile to the summit, the mountain was covered in a shroud of fog. No views from Mount Cube today. I did my stretching and called WW from the top, but it had not cleared when I left.
The hike down was long and easy. That didn’t stop me from hitting a slick spot and going heels up. My pack provided a nice soft landing. About 10 minutes from the top the clouds evaporated leaving behind sunny skies. I stopped at Bracket Brook towards the bottom of the mountain to refill on water. Grumpy came by me while I was breaking. He was in a hurry to meet up with a friend. I caught up with the two of them at the next road crossing. His friend Bill had hiked south from NH 25 with a bag full of snacks and a sub sandwich for Grumpy. He was finishing off the sandwich when I arrived. I fixed my own lunch and ate some grapes that Bill packed in. The three off us then hiked over Misty Mountain. It was an easy climb on an absolutely beautiful day. A vista along the way offered a view of Mount Moosilaule, the introduction peak to the White Mountains. 
Bill’s car was parked at NH 25. He gave Grumpy and I a lift down to the Hiker’s Welcome Hostel. It has two large bunk houses and an outdoor shower and laundry. I hit them all. When we walked in another hiker said,  “Next Step!”  He introduced himself as Cbiscuit and said he had been following our journal. When I went to the bunk house to get situated, another hiker named Daymaker walked up asked if I was Next Step. He said he had been following the journal as well. Then he introduced me to a third hiker, Willow, who said the same thing. They all asked about Which Way. Our journey together and the way we interacted was their favorite part of the journey. They are all hoping that she will rejoin me for the final push through the 100-mile Wilderness. Me too! Daymaker is section hiking and has a car with him, so I joined him, Willow, and another hiker named Don’t Care for dinner. It was a fun time.
Excited about tomorrow’s hike over Mount Moosilauke. It should be another great day on the AT.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597673,"Day Maker offered me a lift back to the trailhead this morning. He even sent me on my way with a cold Gatorade. It was a chilly morning and I started the hike with my long sleeve shirt and glove inserts.
Spring came at last and I love it! The hike was all about Mount Moosilauke today. It is considered the southern gateway to the White Mountains on the AT. At an elevation of 4,802 feet, it is also the first peak over 4K since Virginia (not counting Killington Peak accessed by the blue blaze trail). It is also one of 20 4K+ peaks along the AT in New Hampshire.
This was bound to be a great day! The adrenaline was already pumping through my body as I rock-hopped across Oliverian Brook and hit the Glencliff Trail leading to the summit of Moosilauke. The 3,700’ ascent was spread over 5.5 miles. The trail was soft in the beginning and the slope increased over distance. The bulk of the climb came over the two miles leading up to the Moosilaule South Peak. Rocks and boulders replaced the soft trail, but they were shaped and spaced in a way that did not hinder my stride. After a few days of relatively low miles I felt more rested and stronger than I have in a while. Although the grade towards the top was very steep, my breathing and rhythm were in check and the excitement grew inside of me. I was back in the mountains again and it felt great! After reaching South Peak, the trail would rise only 300 more feet over the next mile. The anticipation was growing and it was all I could do to keep from sprinting to the top. I could hear joyful sounds coming from hikers already at the top. About a half mile out I could see the open summit and the rock cairns marking the path. The evergreen trees grew shorter, eventually giving me views to the east and west. Then everything began to open up as I came within 200 yards of the rocky summit. Magnificent! A lump grew in my throat as I held back tears. I hiked hundreds of miles waiting for this moment. At that moment  I was reminded that the AT rewards those who persevere. I couldn’t help but think about Which Way as I drew closer to the top. I was flashing back to the time I caught up to her as she was singing praise to God at an awesome vista in North Carolina. I could almost see her ahead of me climbing with confidence, reminiscent of the day she hiked up Hump Mountain. Yes, this is still our journey. At the summit everything opened up. The 360 view was simply breathtaking. I’m pretty certain it is the best I’ve witnessed thus far. A look back to the high peaks of Vermont; she never looked so beautiful. Endless mountains to the northwest and southeast. But the most glorious view was to the northeast. Kinsman Mountain in the foreground—tomorrow’s trek. Behind it was the Franconia Ridge, rising to Mount Lincoln and Mount Lafayette—a two day hike. Beyond that, more of the Presidentials. On the edge of the horizon rose Mount Washington—still four days of hiking away. It was all right there before me. I could almost trace the AT over the mountains and ridges. Over a hundred miles of this to come...and beyond that...the Wildcats...Maine. As WW would say, WOWSA!!! 
Epic was waiting at the top for me. We hung out for a while, taking it all in and chatting with other hikers, who had converged on the summit from all directions. We  started working our way off the north side of the summit, now following the Beaver Brook Trail. The AT is still marked with white blazes through the White Mountains, but other trail names are used to label the path. Within a 1/4 mile we were  back in the wood line. The 3,000’ descent over four miles started out on a gradual decline. Once again the trail was soft. About 2.5 miles into the descent the trail passed by Beaver Brook Shelter. By the way, this marked the 1,800 mike point (Wowza Yowza). From here the trail followed Beaver Brook down the mountain as it cascaded it’s way down the steep decline. The extremely steep slope was 25-30% grade for over a mile. All along the way were spectacular Falls and occasional views of Kinsman Mountain. Once again, the spacing of large boulders and rocks made the hike down fairly easy. Rain would have turned it from a technical challenge to a treacherous undertaking. Not today though. 
Epic and I decided we would share a room in North Woodstock at the end of the day. We could get a free shuttle to the Inn from Kinsman Notch (today) and Franconia Notch (tomorrow). It is about the same distance from both locations. This would allow us to keep the same room and leave behind the items not needed for tomorrow’s hike. When we got to Kinsman Notch a surprise awaited us in the form of Trail Magic! Hydro, the trail angel, asked me if I was Next Step when I emerged from the woods into the parking lot. I said I was and he shook my hand and introduced himself. I recognized the name as someone who had sent me a note from our trail journal guestbook a week or two ago. He said that he was going to try to bring me some trail Magic when I hit the White Mountains. He certainly made good on his promise. We offered up Ham and Swiss Cheese wraps, donuts, sodas, chips, Little Debbie Snacks, etc. In other words, lunch and dessert. Hydro drove two hours from Maine to deliver the Magic. He said he follows one or two journals each year and tries to meet the people he follows. I just wish he could have met the better half of our Journal. When he is not building hydro-electric projects and delivering trail magic, Hydro is an active member of the Maine AT Club. He and his wife help edit the Maine AT Guidebook every year. It was a pleasure to meet him and share in his magic. Grumpy and two other NOBOs (Pac-Man and his wife Pace Car) eventually joined Epic and me as recipients of Hydro’s kindness.
After hanging in the parking area for about an hour, I called for our shuttle. By 3:30PM we were settled in our room. We pretty much just lazed around talking about what a great day it had been and planning the next step. We took a break to walk a short distance to the Woodstock Inn for a delicious dinner. There is so much more to be said, but I’m tired of writing, as I’m sure some of you are tired of reading.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597801,"The hike today featured two big climbs. The first was up Wolf Mountain. The 1,700’ climb over 5 miles made it a nice warm up for the day. A couple of miles into the hike I came over a little rise and heard something thrashing in the thick vegetation. I thought it was way too loud to be a squirrel. I stood still for a couple of minutes to see if something appeared. Then came this big dark beast moving not so gracefully on stilted legs. It was a moose! I was using an evergreen tree for camouflage. As it appeared from behind the tree the young bull stopped, stretching its long neck out and turning its disproportionate snout in my direction. It’s body language said to me, “I just want to lumber down into this patch of tasty broad- leafed vegetation and finish my breakfast.” I answered back, “If you don’t mind I’ll just stay right here and get some pictures and a video.” With our agreement in place, the moose continued into the shrubs and resumed grazing away. I watched for a few minutes as the large (small by moose standards) animal snapped off branches with a twist of its long neck and munched away. Soon I heard two rather noisy hikers headed up the trail. The moose looked up in that direction, but kept eating. I let out a whistle to alert the hikers. “What was that?” The hikers stopped for a second, but were soon moving again. I whistled again. They stopped again, talking about what they had heard. They were at a spot that I couldn’t see them, but they had a vantage point to the moose. Then one of them yelled out, “Look, a moose!” With that, my long lanky friend disappeared into the forest. When the hikers came by I suggested that if they wait right here (quietly) the moose might reappear. They moved on. I sent a text back to Epic letting him know to be on the lookout. He told me later that day that when he came over the rise, Mr. Moose was standing in the middle of the trail. I guess he did return. I finished the climb up Wolf Mtn, taking a side trail to the summit, where I took in a great view as I did my morning stretches. 
The next climb was up Kinsman Mountain, a 2,000’ climb over 2 miles. It was in the “very steep” category, with parts of the ascent being extremely steep! Appliance sized rocks replaced suitcase sized rocks as a hiked further up. About halfway up I came to an opening with a great view of the mountain and rocky cliff face. Back in the forest, the climb turned into a rock scramble. At points, I was on all fours in search of a crevice to cling to on steeply slanted slabs of granite. The view at the top was amazing! Franconia Ridge and the Presidential Range were in clear sight now. A glider flew circles above as I celebrated the climb and marveled in the view. But, I wasn’t finished. The trail dropped down into a saddle and rose to North Kinsman Mountain. I dropped down off the trail to a wonderful place to stop for a late lunch. The warm sun, cool breeze, and magnificent view tempted me to just stay put right here for the night. Gotta keep moving though if I’m going to make Franconia Ridge tomorrow while the weather is still nice. 
The final five miles of the hike was a descent of nearly 3,000 feet. The trail passed by Lonesome Lake and one of the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) huts. The huts are full service lodges spread throughout the White Mountains. As you might imagine it is a very popular destination for tourists wanting a piece of the outdoors, without the filth. I walked by a dozen or so sweet smelling folks down by the dock, greeted them and moved on before they had a chance to inhale. 
The descent took a toll on my feet and legs. Both knees and my ankles were sore after taking hundreds of big step downs. I was ready to be done for the day. When the trail softened a bit, I picked up a jog. I reached Franconia Notch at 5PM on the nose. Epic was waiting where the trail crossed under I-93. From there we took a 1-mile side trail to a parking area where our shuttle driver picked us us up. She was kind enough to run us by a grocery store in Lincoln for a resupply. The store was very busy and I was unable to get some of my usual resupply. Then it was back to the motel in North Woodstock. We still needed to do laundry and grab dinner. I was very tired and feeling anxious about being able to get the journal done. I slept hard through the night. Fortunately, or unfortunately, our shuttle driver back to the trail was not ready at the designated time of 0630. So, I was able to finish up the journal before departing for the trail. I’m ready for a great day now! (and the readers don’t have to wait:-))

",Franconia Notch,"Jul 20, Fri",16.30
Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597879,"Oh what a glorious day. The hike took me over Fraconia Ridge and four mountains standing over 4,000’ high. With an average grade for the hike of over 15 percent there were some very steep and sometimes extremely steep ascents and descents. However, it was all worth it. The 2,800’ climb to Franconia  Ridge Ridge Trail was spread over less than three miles. There is a campsite and a spring just before the trail intersection. I had already sucked my water dry and stopped here to refill my hydration. bag.  The stream provided only a trickle of water with a flow rate of about .3 liters per minute. Just before reaching the campsite I caught up with Don’t Care (DC), who I met at the Hikers Welcome Hostel. DC is hiking with Willow, who was waiting for him at the Franconia Trail intersection. I ended up leapfrogging with them the rest of the day.
The trail dropped down a bit before climbing to Little Haystack Mountain. The climbing was a little more technical here. The excitement was bulging though. I pulled myself up and over one boulder that offered a view back to the south and west. There was a fabulous view of Liberty Mountain here. I continued hiking up the open ridge. It was less than a 1/4 mile to Little Haystack. Dozens of day hikers were converging on the spot, most of them coming up a side trail from a parking area far below. At the top everything opened up and I could see for miles in every direction. To the west stood the Kinsman Peaks and Moosilaule.  Behind them were other mountains I had crossed stretching all the way back to Vermont. To the north stood Mount Lincoln and a clear view of the trail that led to it. To the east stood Mount Washington. All around were layers upon layers of distant peaks and ranges. The trail headed due north now and I joined in a stream of hikers with their sights set on Mount Lincoln, rising above 5,000 feet. The austere ridge stayed above tree line and the trail weaved around and over large boulders and rock formations. The climb up Lincoln was significant, but easily done in the pure excitement of the moment. I made it to the top a little past noon. More jaw dropping views. Mount Lafayette was now in view. It stood a couple hundred feet higher than Lincoln. I paused for lunch in behind a boulder where I was shaded from the sun. 
It was another mile to Mount Lafayette. The ridge once again dipped down into a saddle before climbing to the top. More of the same from the summit—fabulously wonderful, magnificently awe inspiring, glorious views. The trail would turn north from here with Mount Garfield being the next peak. It stood with prominence and I could tell that getting to, over and down it would be hard hiking. It was! The trail descended steeply off of Lafayette, dropping back below tree line.  It crossed over a smaller ridge before starting the extremely steep 800’ climb to the open summit. I climbed off trail to the summit and took in more views. Then came the steep descent off of Garfield. I was hoping to make it to Galehead Hut today, but hit the Garfield Tenting Area about half way down the mountain. It was 4:30PM and I had already told myself that I would start looking for shelter after 4PM. Plus, there was no guarantee I would be able to get in on work for stay at the hut, which was still a couple of miles away. I retrieved water from a steam before hiking a quarter mile up to the shelter. I stopped by the caretakers tent to checkin and pay the $10 fee. A nice new shelter had just been built. I decided to stay there with the threat of rain and high winds tonight.
Oh, what a glorious day!

",Garfield Ridge Shelter,"Jul 21, Sat",10.30
Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597989,"I was asleep by 7:30 and woke up a little after 4AM to a full shelter. The wind gusted hard all night, but the rain never came. It was 0630 by the time I finished the previous day’s journal entry (offline), packed up, ate breakfast and hit the trail. The skies to the east were still partly clear, but clouds were thickening to the west. The biggest chance of rain and storms was forecast to begin at 1100. My goal was to finish the Garfield descent and get up and over South Twin Mountain (elev. 4,902) before then. 
The descent off Garfield was slow going as I picked my way through, over, and around rocks and boulders. There were some ups and downs along Garfield Ridge leading up to the base of South Twin. Not far into the 1,600’ climb to South Twin the trail passed in front of Galehead Hut. It was 0800 now so I popped inside to check it out. The hut is nothing more than a fancy bunkhouse with a kitchen and dining room. DC, Willow and a few other hikers were sitting at a table when I came through the door. They arrived last night after 7PM and slept on the floor after pulling some work-for-stay duties. In addition to a place to sleep, they got to finish off the leftovers from dinner last night. Now they were waiting for breakfast leftovers followed by more kitchen duty. Most of the patrons had already moved on to the next hut or were hiking out to their cars. I talked to the caretaker a bit and he invited me to stay for leftovers—sausage, cold oatmeal and crumb cake. After we all finished eating he put me to work washing dishes, my specialty. 
It was nearly 0939 by the time I left the hut. The wind was blowing hard outside on the exposed rock where the hut sat. Clouds were building to the west. “Must get up  that mountain!” The trek up was more of the same—bowling ball, then beach ball, then suitcase, then appliance sized rocks (think Flintstones when you picture these objects); followed by granite boulders and slabs to work over. Every now and then I would take a peek back over my shoulder to the west. Franconia Ridge was consumed by the dark clouds first. As I got closer to the top I looked back just as Garfield was about to be under siege. As I closed in on the open summit, two SOBOs were headed down. One said, “Find something to hang on to up there!” I could hear the wind howling above me now. As soon as I emerged from the 8’ foot pines onto the rocky summit I was greeted with what must have been 50-60mph winds and rain. It was all I could do to stay on my feet. There was a sign at the top marking the summit and a trail intersection. I had my head down and did not look at the sign for fear of being blown off the mountain. I continued up the open ledge on what I thought was the AT. I went around a huge rock formation that marked the actual summit. On the other side was more wind and open ledges. Something didn’t feel right. I ducked behind a boulder to check my GPS position on Guthook. It showed that I was off Trail and that the AT had taken a 160 degree turn back in the vicinity of the signpost. As I was working my way back DC, Willow, and another thru hiker were headed towards me. I passed the other hiker coming up the mountain and tried to engage her in conversation. She didn’t have much to say. I figured she must be having a bad day and I moved on. As the three of them were coming over a rock in my direction I said that Guthook had us off trail. The other hiker snapped, “Guthook isn’t always right!” I replied, “I agree, but something doesn’t feel right and I want to go back to see what that sign said. Did you see the sign?” She just walked past me without a reply. DC was last in the line and I told him I thought we were off trail. He followed the girls as he pulled out his phone to pull up Guthook. I turned back around and followed all of them. When they got around the big rock formation and saw how things were looking iffy they stopped. By then DC had Guthook up and he saw what I saw. I said that we should go back and see what the sign said before continuing down this exposed path. They all followed me back. When we got to the sign we realized that the AT had taken a 160 turn off the mountain. The trail that went straight was a spur. Grumpy had just arrived at the top, disoriented by the gale force wind he said I was gong down the same trail we had just come up. I waited in the tree line for a few seconds until they all realized I was headed in the right direction and they followed me down. The odd thing was that within a quarter mile down the mountain the wind was calm. The rain continued to fall and would pick up in intensity as the day progressed. Fortunately the hardest terrain was behind us. I posted a short video on Instagram of my wind encounter at the summit. I hadn’t felt that alive since Winter Storm Toby in the Smokies!
It  was a 2,500’ descent to Zealand Falls Hut. Grumpy, Kylo (who I hadn’t seen in weeks) and I hiked into the hut together. It was nice to get out of the rain and enjoy some potato soup and cornbread. After close to an hour break, the three of us ventured back into the cold rain. We were all wearing our rain jackets now, as we got a little chilled during the break.  It was an easy climb over 5 miles to Ethan Pond Shelter. Kyle kept going from there, but I popped in to check it out. The 6-person shelter was full and I didn’t get a good vibe from the spot so I decided to keep hiking. Grumpy was already on his way out when I came in.  I eventually caught up with him and Kylo. We all continued on the steep, but easy descent down to Crawford Notch. To wrap this up, we ended up hitching a ride to the AMC Center. The bunkhouse was full. A guy overheard our dilemma and said he was staying at a reasonably priced hotel down in Twin Mountains, it was part of the very fancy Omni Resort at the base of Mount Washington. We checked in, showered, and took the Resort shuttle to the big hotel for dinner. We are safe, dry, fed, and getting rested for a big day tomorrow. We start the climb up Mount Washington.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598113,"Today was a mixed bag of so many things the trail had offered to this point, on steroids. There were steep climbs, slippery descents, rock scrambles, high bogs, huge boulders, streams running down the trail and rad weather. The rain came early and continued throughout the day. There was drizzle, fog, large rain drops, and horizontal pelting rain. The wind was gale force at times. It was a brutally fun day. Yes, brutal and fun. It was as if every challenge and trail conditioning over the past five months were all leading to this day. It was without a doubt one of the most challenging hikes I have ever had, from the terrain, to the elevation gain, to the weather conditions. But I was ready for what the trail dished out and the experience will be remembered for a lifetime. The only thing missing were jaw dropping vistas. They were there, but were hidden behind a curtain of clouds, fog and rain. So, while I don’t have a lot of pics for you, I have the memory of when I rode the beast and walked away unscathed. 
Grumpy, Kylo and I got a ride back to Crawford Notch from the Housekeeping Manager at the lodge. About a mile from the Notch rain and fog set in. Our driver said that this area makes its own weather. When she dropped us off at 0830 it was raining steady. It would not let up for more than 15 minutes the rest of the day. 
The trail was a gravel path and started off nice and easy as we crossed the Saco River on a foot bridge. The gravel gave way to a leaf-covered trail. Within a half mile we were stepping up rocks on a steep incline. It eventually became an extreme climb as we ascended 3,000’ to Mount Webster over the first three miles. Many sections turned into a downright rock scramble. Other parts involved traversing steep rocky inclines. As usual, this involved finding grooves and cracks in the slick rocks. From the Webster Cliffs (which undoubtedly offered awesome views on a clear day) it was a series of inclines and declines over 4K footers.
First was Mount Jackson, a challenge by itself. It was 1PM when we stopped for a break at the Mizpah Spring Hut. The first 6.5 miles took 4.5 hours to complete. It was nice to get out of the rain. We each had a couple of bowls of soup with the lunch from our food bags. Not to mention cookies and a peanut butter jelly wrap compliments of a day hiker. By 2PM we were all set to go. Grumpy took off about 10 minutes before me and Kylo about 10 minutes after me.
We had about 5.5 miles of hiking before reaching the Lake of the Clouds Hut. I ended up hiking the entire distance without seeing anyone. The first climb was over Mt. Pierce. Then came Mt. Eisenhower which was above tree-line. The big story here was the gale force winds and the horizontal rain. It was crazy and I was loving it. There is something extremely exhilarating about hiking in those conditions. However, things can go really bad, really fast. iTherefore, I had to keep my jubilation in check and keep my wits about me. White blazes are few and far between up here, and there are several side trails that can literally lead unweary hikers to their death. Periodically I would duck behind a boulder or among a cluster of dwarf spruce trees to check my GPS to ensure I was still on the right trail. 
Just before 5PM the Lake of the Clouds Hut came into view. As fun as the hiking was, it was good to be safely inside the busy lodge well before dark. Grumpy arrived just before me and Kylo arrived a few minutes later. Our timing was perfect. We were able to get work- for-stay. This allowed us to stay in the main lodge common area and eat leftovers after all of the paying guests were finished with dinner. Hikers who showed up before us had to pay $10 to stay in the basement (infamously referred to as the dungeon). The caretaker in charge wanted to accommodate some of the earlier arriving hikers so she had a sweet proposition for the three of us and one other hiker that showed up after us. She asked us to do a thorough cleaning of one of the bunk rooms. Our work for stay would then be over and we were permitted to occupy the bunk room. Four other hikers were then promoted from the dungeon. They would have kitchen duty after dinner and be allowed to sleep in the spacious dining area. The downside for them is that they can not occupy the space until after quiet time and had to be out by 0630.
It is less than a mile and over a 1,000’ in elevation gain to the top of Mount Washington. The plan is to tackle the summit early in the morning when there is less of a chance of bad weather than the rest of the day. Hopefully we will be rewarded with a view or two.
Another great experience on the grand adventure!

",Lake of the Clouds Hut,"Jul 23, Mon",11.30
Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598218,"At an elevation of 6,288 feet, Mount Washington is the highest peak in the Northeastern United States and the most prominent mountain east of the Mississippi River. It is the second highest point along the AT (Clingman’s Dome is the highest). The mountain is notorious for its erratic weather. On the afternoon of April 12, 1934, the Mount Washington Observatory located at the summit recorded a windspeed of 231 miles per hour, the world record for most of the 20th century. It is also one of he most deadly mountains in the world, with 150 deaths recorded in as many years. Most deaths occur from exposure in the months of July and August. The reason, the mountain is easily accessible and folks venturing out for a “little” stroll on the unforgiving terrain are unprepared (lack of shelter, lack of layered clothing, and hiking alone). There are three primary methods of accessing the summit of Mount Washington: 1) a cog railway ascends the western slope, 2) the Mount Washington Auto Road climbs to the summit from the east, and 3) hike in. Today we took the latter of the three. 
Grumpy, Kylo and I set out from Lake of the Clouds Hut a little past 0630. A thick fog/mist hung over the alpine plane as we headed northeast up Crawford Path. Cairns steered us along the 1,300’ climb to the summit. As has been the case through a big portion of the Whites, there are no white blazes to mark the path. There are also multiple trails (also marked with cairns) intersecting with the AT. This made it crucial to stop and study each signpost to ensure we were headed in the right direction. Thick fog added to the difficulty in navigation, as the next cairn was sometimes hard to locate. The following factors added to the difficulty of the hike throughout the day: low visibility, high winds, wet rocks, boulder fields, and steep grades. The winds picked up as we stumbled our way over Pennsylvania-style rocks all the way to the summit. It would be the easiest ascent of the day. At the top, the wind speed was 30-40mph, gusting to 60mph. There is a weather observatory at the top of Mt Washington that records conditions. Anyone can access this info on-line. There  is also a visitors center and restaurant located at the summit. Everything was locked up tight. The rain and much cooler temps made it unbearable to hang around the deserted summit. We sought temporary refuge from the wind around one side of the restaurant. After adding a layer of clothing, putting some hiker fuel in our bodies, and catching our bearings, we headed down the northern slope along the Gulf Side Trail. We crossed over the cog rail a few hundred yards down the trail, then descended along the rim of the Great Gulf. The wind was whipping at gale force causing us to  slant our bodies at a 30 degree angle as we pecked our way over the slippery rocks. It was wonderfully crazy. 
After descending to an elevation of 5,000 ft we climbed another 500’ close to the summit of Mt. Jefferson. There was some partial clearing of skies here and I was able to get some good pics of Jefferson and Adams. Looking Northeast to Adams I marveled at how the mountains make weather. A huge cloud clung to the southeast slope as other clouds whipped by the north slope at warp speed. The west slope was clear. As we came under the west slope of Jefferson I could see where the path turned east down below and headed up Mount Adams. Oh my—more fun ahead!
It was an 800’ climb up Adams. A good portion of it was a rock scramble. The winds picked up as we ascended and we were back in the fog and mist as we passed just under the peak and down to Madison Spring Hut. 
We arrived at the nice little hut at 1130. It had taken us five hours to complete the first 7 miles of the hike. We dug into our food bags and supplemented lunch with some soup and coffee from the hut. A weather forecast and data on Mount Washington over the past 24 hours (as of 7AM) were posted on a wall in the dining area. Nearly 6 inches of rain fell yesterday with an average wind speed of 37mph with gusts as high as 58mph. No wonder I was having such a good time.
 An hour after we arrived we were headed to Madison Spring Hut. The trail continued east and immediately began the ascent up Mount Madison. This peak proved to be the biggest beast of the day. Just a few hundred feet up we were back in the clouds and mist. The wind was headed straight down the mountain as we were struggling to scramble over the biggest and baddest boulders of the day. Every now and then a cross wind would try to catch my pack and send me into a pirouette. More dance lessons. After reaching the top, the trail turned south and began a 3,000’ descent. Not so fast! The initial descent off of Madison was more like a roller coaster over huge heaps of boulders and rocks. The whole event was ultra challenging. The landscape and weather conditions made it surreal. A moment of panic set in...”Am I on the wrong PLANET?!?!”. A quick check of Guthook lowered my heart rate. Still on on plant Earth, and, yes, the AT is headed south, right towards Mount Washington. The hike today was essentially a big inverted fishhook.
There were seconds of partial clearing coming down Madison. I caught more views of Adams (now to the northwest), Washington (SW) and the Wildcat Range (SE). At 4,300’ the trail dropped below treeline for the first time since yesterday. Two factors—the wind and visibilty—were no longer an issue. The primary difficulty now was the narrow trail coupled with slick bowling and beachball size rocks. With a wall of Dwarf Spruce on either side of the 2-3 ft wide trail, it was impossible to pick and choose your own line through the rocks. This went on for a couple of miles. 
Finally, the trail came by an official tent site and began a series of stream crossings. Poor markings and a lack of good signage made it difficult to ascertain the AT way to Pinkham Notch. Once I was on track, the trail eased up considerably for the final 1-2 miles. It’s a good thing, because my feet and knees were beat. I reached Pinkham Notch a little before 5PM. Hydro was sitting on a rock at the trailhead. He reached in a cooler and handed me an ice cold Mountain Dew. Perfect! Grumpy and Kylo arrived at Pinkham Notch within 15 minutes. Hydro had enough drinks and a Pepperoni Pizza for all of us. He was even gracious enough to give me a ride past Gorham to the Rattle River Hostel. Grumpy and Kylo packed into a full shuttle and we followed them to the hostel. Hydro said he would be out of country next week and unable to meet me when I came through his neck of the woods in Maine. I joked, “Bummer, you can just leave me your truck keys.” Hydro quipped back, “That’s not gonna happen!” I knew I liked this guy for more than just his generous food and drink offerings. Safe travels Hydro!
Taking a zero on Wednesday. I pushed my body a little past max the past couple of days and need a little down time to recover. Played some Settlers of Catan last night (1W 1L). The readers will just have to wait:-)

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598454,"The shuttle driver returned five of us NOBOs to the Pinkham Notch Visitors Center at 0730. Of course, it was raining when we crossed NH Rt 16 to start our hike. It would rain on and off all day. Whether it was raining or not was irrelevant from an ease of hiking perspective. The trail was wet and muddy all day. A stream ran down the AT in many places. Bogs and ponds were filled to the brink with knee-high run off covering the trail in several spots. Rocks and boulders were wet and slick making steep climbs treacherous at times.
The trail took me over seven mountains standing taller than 4,000 feet. First came the Wildcat Range. The most difficult ascent of the day was the 2,000’ climb up Wildcat D Peak. The 2 mile ascent was rocky and extremely steep in places. Next came Wildcat Mountain, which was home to a ski resort. Partial clearing at times lured me into finding a spot to sit on a ledge or outcropping in hopes of catching a view of Mount Washington. It stood immediately to the west now, as the trail was about to turn north again, completing a giant “S” since departing Lake of the Clouds Hut. No such luck with the view of Washington, but I did enjoy watching the clouds in motion as they opened and closed the curtain on views. 
The Wildcat Range and Carter Range are separated by Carter Notch. At the bottom of the deep notch sits the easternmost huts in the White Mountains. It is also one of the smallest and most remote huts. The side trail to the hut took me between two ponds. Water from the swollen ponds stood 2-3 ft deep on the trail. 
Inside the hut I enjoyed a bowl of delicious lintel soup to go with my PBJ. For dessert I had a piece of scrumptious Ginger Bread Cake and a cup of coffee. It was 2PM when I hit the trail again. I had only hiked 6 miles and still had 7 remaining to Imp Camp.
It was more slow going over the Carter Range—Career Dome, Mount Height, South Carter Mountain, Middle Carter Mountain and North Carter Mountain. Alpine bogs meant more standing water on the trail. The final two miles was a steep descent down a ravine. I arrived at the wet and muddy campsite after 7:30PM. Way too late for my liking. Nonetheless, it was nice to get my wet shoes off my water logged feet. Wet, tired and no place I’d rather be, than on the AT.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598546,"Something unusual happened today. The sun came out! Knowing that my things would dry soon made putting my wet clothes and shoes back on a little easier.
Out of camp, the trail continued northeast over Mount Moriah. It would be the only notable climb of the day. The path was still muddy and the rocks were wet as I started hiking. However, as the trail gained elevation and turned to solid rock the sun and wind had dried the surface. Mount Moriah was not a cake walk, but it sure seemed easy in comparison to what I’d been hiking through as of late. The real significance of the climb was that views were opening up along the summit ridge. I. could look back and see the Carter and Wildcat Ranges of yesterday. To the northwest were clear views of Madison, Adams and other Presidential Mountains. Following a line south from Adams was Mount Washington, with itssummit still obscured by clouds. What a sight!
Over the the top the trail dropped back into the trees and started a steep descent towards the Rattle River. The rocks were wet again making the going slow. After crossing the river, the final two miles to NH Rt 2 was easy and mostly puddle- free terrain. It was a soft landing to an otherwise rough few days of hiking. 
The trail passed directly in front of the Rattle River Shelter. I arrived a little after 1130 and mostly chilled the rest of the day. Hard to believe I’ll be in Maine tomorrow.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598661,"I was up past hiker midnight last night playing games and talking hiker trash. Yes, I chalked up another Catan victory. After the late night, I slept in a little longer than usual. The shelter spacing north of Gorham dictated that I would only hike about 12 miles today, so I was not in a hurry to get to hiking. The stay at the Rattle River Hostel includes all-you-eat (fix em yourself) pancakes and full use of the kitchen. Grumpy picked up some blueberries to throw in the pancakes and I grabbed a dozen eggs and a package of sausage. Some of the other hikers helped finish off the sausage and eggs.  
It was 0845 when I walked out of the hostel and picked up the trail following a side road off Rt 2. After crossing below the Androscoggin River  just below a dam the trail turned onto a gravel road. About a mile into the hike the trail became a trail again. The nice soft path quickly gave way to one that was covered with roots, rocks and mud. The humidity kicked in as the trail worked its way 1,800’ up Mt. Hayes. This brought the gnats out in force and I took multiple hits in my eyes. Not fun! There were several false summits on the way to the top of Mt. Hayes. The open rocky spaces provided excellent views back to the Moriah and Carter Ranges, as well as cloud obscured views of Mount Washington and Madison. It is still hard for me to fathom that I hiked over those prominent peaks. 
The larger rocks were mostly dry today taking the slip factor way from some of the steeper parts of the hike. The air also seemed drier coming down the north slopes of the mountains than it did during the climbs up. An easy ascent of Mount Cascade followed Mt. Hayes.  More nice views for me. Unfortunately the haze in the air limited what could be seen through my I-phone camera. About halfway into the hike I stopped at a spring for water and decided to go ahead and eat lunch. Anything to reduce my pack weight! 
A bit after lunch I crossed another stream and came upon some sticks spelling out 1900. A quick check of Guthook confirmed that I had sure enough hit another 100 mile milestone. The next one may just be a big deal. 
Another climb over Wocket Ledge and some more root stumbling and mud evading and I was approaching Gentian Pond where I would shelter for the night. I really felt sluggish for most of the hike today. Hopefully I will get some pep in my step tomorrow. After all, I will be crossing into Maine!
Since this is my last full day in New Hampshire I want to thank every agency, club and person who help to maintain the trail through this challenging, but remarkable, section of the AT.
Peace and Blessings

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598720,"There were two more mountains to climb in New Hampshire—Carlo and Success. It is appropriate that the final New Hampshire peak on the AT is named Mount Success. A northwest breeze ushered in cooler and drier weather as air I started the final ascent. No gnats either. Perfect hiking conditions! About a half mile out of camp a hiker came up from behind moving fast. When I stepped aside to let him pass I recognized him from the shelter as a member of the SOBO  Breakfast Club. The pungent smell of marijuana wafted down to the the shelter from a tent site and he popped down a few minutes later wearing the stoners cologne. As he passed I ask him if he came from Georgia (I already knew the answer). He gleefully responded, “no, I came from Mount Katahdin, but I’m headed to Georgia.” I said, “well, I came from Georgia and I’m headed to Maine, so one of us is going in the wrong direction.” I pulled up Guthook and showed him the blue dot indicating where we were standing. We were between the icon for the shelter and the one indicating Maine. “Yeah, Maine. That’s where I came from.” About that time the fog lifted (figuratively) and he realized he was heading in the wrong direction. Buzz kill!
It was a short steep climb over Carlo Mountain. There was a partial view of Mount Success from the summit. The dark gray clouds  whipping around the top made it look chilly.  I descended from Carlo into a a deep col and then began the steep climb up Mount Success. There were a few short scrambles thrown in for good measure. It was in fact quite chilly at the summit. However, through the sporadic clouds were wonderful views in all directions. I took a moment to reflect on what I had accomplished in getting through the Whites in tough conditions. I also contemplated what was ahead as I looked Northeast at the rugged mountainous landscape of Maine. I sure hope the weather is good up there. Wishful thinking, I’m sure.
The descent down Mount Success was marked by several deep ravines. The terrain was extremely steep, rocky, mostly wet, and overall tricky in these ravines. New Hampshire got the final day! But, at 1100 sharp I came to the sign indicating that I had reached the NH/ME state line. Hallelujah! I had finally reached the final state in an amazing 14-State journey. I celebrated a little and thought about Which Way a lot. I wish she were here. Boy, she would have hated these ravines though. But, we’d get through it together like we do everything else.
Just a little past the state line I came to the blue blaze trail leading to Carlos Col Shelter. I dropped my pack and walked about 150 yards down the trail to get some water. Back at the intersection, I decided it was time for lunch. I have had a hard time pouring enough calories in my body to fuel me through the difficult terrain of the past week. It sure hasn’t been for a lack of trying.
Goose Eye Mountain was the first big climb in Maine. It had a West Peak and East Peak. Both ascents/descents where characterized by deep ravines, short rock scrambles, muddy bogs, and open rocky ridges. Scrubby pines and blueberry bushes lined the trail along the ridges. The sweet blueberries are coming into season and I stopped periodically to eat a few right off of the bush. Goose Eye West Peak presented some tricky obstacles and magnificent views. Perseverance and reward! In fact, there were plenty of each today. I thought of WW for each. She would hate this! She would LOVE that! 
Every mile was earned today with some type of obstacle to negotiate at least every five minutes. I even had to climb another ladder to get to the shelter. What a day! Maine! Big picture wise I am so close to the finish. But there are still many tough days of hiking ahead. With some good weather there will also be some remarkable views. Of course, there will be the kind and interesting strangers. I’m so ready!
Big day tomorrow as I take on the Mahoosuc Notch. It is considered by most to be the hardest mile on the AT. It should also be one of the most fun miles.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598863,"As you might have guessed, I’ve been running low on calories and sleep lately. Well, I did some catching up on both last night. I fixed my emergency packet of Knorr Mexican Rice to go with my usual Salami, Bacon and Cheese Sandwich. After dinner I crawled into my tent with the intention of writing up a journal entry. Instead, I was asleep before 7PM.
I slept until after 5AM, which is the most sleep I’ve had in some time. It was after 8AM by the time I finished the journal this morning, ate breakfast, packed up my gear, and had a nice long uninterrupted call with Which Way.  No hurry. No worries.
Grumpy took off several minutes before me, but was planning on waiting at the entrance to the Mahoosuc Notch so we could go through it together. A second set of stairs took me down the northbound AT. At the bottom of the stairs I came upon a red squirrel perched on a log eating its breakfast. Now, I have been trying to get a picture of one of these fiesty little guys since  the Green Mountains. When I come up to the temperamental little critters they usually bark at me and work their whole body into a quiver. But by the time I reach for my camera, they scurry out of sight. Not this time though. This fellow was more interested in ravaging his nut than he was about me stepping on his turf. So, as he kept one of his bugged eyes on me and chomped away on breakfast, I finally got the shot I’ve been waiting for. I thought, “It’s gonna be a fabulous day!” I also came by some interesting spongy moss, some pretty flowers, more neat mushrooms and a snake today. 
The first order of business was the climb up and over Filling Mill South Peak. It had a few obstacles which provided a good warm up for what was ahead. I caught up with Grumpy at the south entrance to the “Notch”. It was 0930 when we began navigating up and over the first of many boulders. Two quick thoughts on the Notch. First, it was not how I imagined it would be. I pictured these huge clumps of white rounded boulders. As it turns out, there are lots of trees, moss, flowers and other vegetation amongst the rocks in the Notch. Second, I thought it was much less difficult than all the hype led me to believe. It was a rock scramble for sure. There was plenty of lifting, scooting, balancing, crawling, etc. However, it was not any more difficult than other obstacles encountered along the AT. It just happened to continue for a full mile. Personally, I thought it was fun. Grumpy, on the other hand wasn’t having such a grand time. He fell twice in the first hundred feet. Unfortunately, he dislocated his shoulder on one of the falls. It popped back in to place, but he had limited use of his left arm. The result was that he was unable wear his pack over many of the obstacles. I ended up carrying it through many of the harder stretches for him. The whole event ended up taking us 2.5 hours. I am confident that we would have made it in an hour if Grumpy hadn’t sustained an injury. Before I move on, one last interesting thing about the Notch. The deep gulch sits between two very steep mountains. It doesn’t get a lot of sunlight and in a few crevices there was still patches of ice and snow. 
We stopped at a nice stream for lunch. I took advantage of the opportunity to soak my feet in the cool water. I really need to do this more often. Grumpy started up Mahoosuc Arm while I chatted for another half hour with a couple of SOBOs. The 1,700’ climb up Mahoosuc Arm was extremely steep with a few difficult obstacles to overcome. More great views to the north at the summit. A little over a half mile down the other side is Speck Pond. The final AMC shelter is located on the pond. I found Grumpy there. He had already contacted his wife in Massachusetts with instructions to come pick him up at the next road crossing. His hike was on hold for now. Grumpy unloaded some of his food on me to reduce his pack weight. He then thanked me for my help and moved on. I offered to walk out with him, but he said he could manage. One real truth of long distance wilderness hiking is that you need to be prepared to self evacuate, because it is likely that no one is coming to your rescue. Grumpy is a flip flopper with about 1,000 miles under his belt. This is the second time he had to come off for an injury. Wishing you a speedy recovery Grumpy. Keep the dream alive!
The newly built Speck Pond Shelter was spacious and clean. I wanted to tent again but all of the platforms were being used by group hikers. After dinner I went down to the large pond and started working on the journal entry. I also kept one eye out for a moose. 
Back at the shelter, the journal entry is done and it looks like I will once again be asleep before dark. Sweet Dreams!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598949,"What a wonderful day! I knew  it would a great day after just  5 minutes into my hike I slipped off a rock while getting a final picture of Speck Pond. No worries, I’ll just dry my shoe out later. Within the next 5 minutes I came across a Spruce Grouse nesting on the side of the trail. I noticed the chick first as it waddled deeper into the woods, clucking at mom along the way. But the hen held her ground and I got a good picture. 
As I worked my way up Old Speck Mountain the trail hit some rocky open spaces with views to the south and west. I stopped on a small boulder where I had good signal to load pics from yesterday and call WW. My shoe mostly dried while I was hanging out and I put on some fresh socks. While I was sitting there I could hear a pack of Coyotes getting worked up back in the direction of Speck Pond. 
It was about 1130 when I hit Grafton Notch. There was a parking area there and the trail crossed over ME 26. It was the first road crossing of any kind since Gorham. There was a thing of beauty and hiker delight in the parking area. A trash can! As I was discarding my garbage a couple of section hikers that I met at the shelter last night arrived at the parking lot. Michele and her daughter, Shannon, were just wrapping up their hike and getting ready to drive back to their home in Portland, ME. I had no intention of riding into Bethel, ME. The little resort town is about 20 miles from the trail. But, when Michele asked me if I wanted a lift into town, I said yes. The only resupply item I needed was a toothbrush and toothpaste. It seems that I left mine at the Rattle River Hostel. A hot lunch sounded good though. On the way in I learned that Michele was an RN and that Shannon was going to school at Norwich, where she was on an ROTC scholarship. Upon graduation Shannon will go into the Army Nurse Corps. Cool! 
Michele dropped me off at Rite Aid, where I picked up a travel size toothbrush and toothpaste. I don’t know if you have ever gone two and a half days without brushing your teeth, but I wouldn’t recommend it. Across from the Rite Aid sat a little country diner. I went inside, brushed my teeth, charged my phone and ordered a salad and pizza. After lunch I wasn’t quite ready to head back to the trail. A couple of hundred yards down the road was a bakery called the Red Hen. I ordered up a slice of blueberry pie, ice cream and a cup of coffee. Now I was ready to get back to the trail. Oh, I just need to figure out a way to get there. I situated myself at an intersection and proceeded to thumb and wave at passing cars. Within 5 minutes a man named Tim stopped to pick me up. He said he could take me as far as the ME 26/2 split. There were not as many cars traveling down ME 26 and it took me about 20 minutes to hitch a ride. Eventually a couple with kayaks  on top of their vehicle stopped. Leslie and Joe are from Connecticut. Their kayaks had flipped on an outing in the area and all of their gear had gotten wet. Subsequently, they had gone to Bethel to do laundry. They also went to the diner and saw me there. Joe had to clear away a bunch of stuff from the backseat to make room for me. How nice!
When we returned to Grafton Notch, Leslie and Joe tossed a bunch of hiker goodies my way. More trail magic. I saw Stickers and Lady Bug sitting at the parking area when I got out of the car. It had been Pennsylvania since I had seen them.  It was a steep climb up Bald Plate West Peak, but I was feeling good after a few short hiking days and my excursion to Bethel. I powered to the covered summit and dropped down into the saddle  between West and East Bald Plate. I hit some foot boards across a boggy area and immediately came across three hikers. Two NOBOs were talking to a SOBO. The two NOBOs were looking my direction and laughing as I was shimmy shaking across the boards. “That’s Next Step!”, I heard them say. When I got closer I recognized the two hikers. It was Doc and Chief. I hadn’t seen them since Boiling Springs, PA. We all hiked together up the open face of East Bald Peak and down to the Lean-to. By the way, the shelters in Maine are referred to as Lean-tos. We arrived at the lean-to a little after 6:30PM. About an hour later Kylo popped in. It was a great day of hiking, seeing new things, taking in views, meeting new people, and reuniting with old Tramily. In closing, plans are in motion for the summit of Mount Katahdin. Which Way will meet me at Baxter State Park on the 19th of August. We hope to summit together on Monday the 20th. We have a few extra days built in just in case the weather delays our summit. By my math, I only need to average 15.4 miles a day, with two Zero Days built in. I really want to finish this without feeling rushed and/or beat down. So, don’t expect huge miles from here on out. Instead, look for really big smiles.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599042,"I got a jump on the day, setting out at 0630. It was a quick climb out of lean-to, followed by a 4 mile descent to Dunn Notch and Falls. There were some 25-100 yard stretches of the trail that were actually void of rocks, mud and/or roots. My feet appreciated these short stints of easy walking. After passing over the falls the trail began a 5 mile ascent to Wyman Mountain. The 2,000’ climb was moderately steep for the first half. After passing by Surplus Pond, there were signs of moose all around the trail. The terrain got a little rough as the trail reached the summit of Wyman and continued down to the Half Mountain Lean-to. I stopped at the lean-to to water up, eat lunch and take a quick feet break. While I was eating, I heard a loud racket coming from the direction of the AT I had hiked up. I thought it was a hiker(s) until I heard it again. This time it sounded like a small tree falling into the thick vegetation. I also thought I heard some hooves striking the rocks on the trail. I quietly finished my lunch and put my shoes back on. Since I didn’t hear an other noises I didn’t bother walking back in the  direction of the noise. Instead I started a difficult 1,500’ descent to Swayer Brook. The descent was followed by a wicked climb up Moody Mountain. The trail rose just under 1,400’ in .8 miles. At the onset I was stepping up 1-2 feet at a time. Although the backside of Moody was a fairly steep descent to Black Brook, it was much more tame. I guess Moody also has a split personality. Nonetheless, the ascent sure left me feeling Moody!
My shuttle driver, Dave, was waiting for me as I crossed the brook and hit South Arm Road at 2:45PM. It was a 9 mile drive on the country road to the little town of Andover, ME. The town was first settled in 1789 by Ezekiel Merrill and his family who were transported there from Bethel, Maine in canoes managed by members of the local Pequawket tribe. The first sawmill was built on the East Branch of the Ellis River in 1791 and was used to provide the lumber for the still standing Merrill-Poor House. The town was incorporated on June 23, 1804 as East Andover, and then renamed Andover in 1820 when Maine separated from Massachusetts.
Early occupations included agriculture and lumbering. As the town developed, factories made doors, sash, blinds, starch, cheese, boots and shoes, edge-tools, carriages and harnesses. It also had a tannery. Located on an intervale surrounded by mountains, Andover was noted for ""its grand and beautiful scenery,"" with streams abounding in trout. After the Civil War, the town became a popular destination for sportsmen,  especially fishermen. In 1960, Andover was selected to be site of the Andover Earth Station, completed in 1962. It was the location of the first live transatlantic television signal broadcast by satellite Telstar 1.
David delivered me to The Pine Ellis Hostel, located on the edge of the very small town. After a shower and laundry I headed to the Andover General Store for dinner and a two day resupply. I just downed my first Whoopie Pie for dessert.
Feeling pretty good after a Moody day!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599179,"I scrambled up a dozen eggs this morning to share with Doc and Chief. The eggs went nicely with the muffins provided by the Pine Ellis Hostel. I took an early shuttle back to the trail and I was hiking up Old Blue Mountain by 0630. It rained most of the night and a thick gray cloud hung over the mountain as I trudged 2,200’ to the top. Without any wind to stir the sticky air it didn’t take long  for me to work up a sweat. Between my perspiration and the wet vegetation that clung tightly to the trail I was sopping wet when I reached the summit. Finally, a cool breeze at the top, The trail provides. 
Next up was Bemis Mountain. The sun was out now and beaming on the open rocks as I worked my way along the ridge between the two Bemis peaks. Rock cairns marked the path through the maze of small pines, shrubs and blueberry bushes. Hot, tired and hungry, I was ready for a break and lunch. I ate ripe blueberries right off the bush as I worked my way to the Bemis Mountain Shelter. Before reaching the shelter a clearing opened up a view to the Saddleback Range and an abundance of lakes and ponds. 
A young hiker named Jeremy was at the shelter when I arrived. He started his hike in Key West Florida and will follow Trails past Katahdin to Canada. That’s pretty amazing. He also had a very small pack that he said weighed 5.6lbs without food and water. I lingered at the shelter for about an hour. I devoured a deli sandwich that I had picked up at the General Store last night.
Back on the trail I was having problems finding a hiking groove. The combination of heat, rocks, roots, and mud puddles had me a little frustrated. I was feeling sorry for myself as I thought about how nice it would be to be with Which Way visiting the kids, going to a movie, playing games, going to church, eating good home cooked meals, looking for a job (scratch that last one).  My knees and feet were taking the brunt of a steep decline. Then, just about the time my pity party was reaching critical mass, Trail Magic! The trail crossed a gravel road where Snowman was cooking up hamburgers and hotdogs for hikers. I sat in the comfy lawn chair, drank a soda and ate a banana as Snowman threw a hamburger and two hotdogs on his small propane grill. Snowman and his wife, Teddy,  do a trail feed at this same spot every Monday and Thursday through mid-September. Teddy was in a nearby brook trout fishing while Snowman held down the fort. For dessert they had an assortment of Little Debbie’s snacks. The trail once again provided with a little help from two amazing Trail Angels. An hour later I was ready to hike again. As I was getting going Doc and Chief showed up. Were they in for a treat! Teddy also returned and tagged Snowman. He now headed to the stream while Teddy took care of the two arriving hikers.
The trail followed the gravel road for about 100 yards then crossed Bemis Stream. It was listed in the Guidebook as a ford, but I was barely able to rock hop my way across. The terrain for the last 5 miles of the hike was tempered a bit. More importantly, I had a better attitude. I hiked just above a large body of water named Long Pond. It was an amazing sight through the trees. A little further I came to Sabbath Day Pond. A shelter was located up a side trail. Time to call it a day. Most of the tent sites were taken so I stayed in the shelter. Doc and Chief showed up about an hour later. The three of us shared the spacious shelter. It started raining just as we all got settled in for the night.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599235,"Today was a day of recovery of sorts. For starters I slept in. Instead of my usual 4-5AM wake up, I didn’t start moving until around 0545. By the time I finished up the journal entry from yesterday, packed up, and ate breakfast it was 0715sh.  Next, it was a short hike to my destination on fairly easy terrain. Finally, I just kind of strolled along, covering about 10 miles in 5.5 hours. 
I took two long breaks along the way. The first one was to stretch, upload the journal pics, and talk to Which Way and our son. The second time was when I came across several moose tracks and heard alot of crashing just off the trail as I came over a rise. Certain that I had heard one or more moose, I eased over the hump and down the other side until I found a good spot to listen and observe. I heard the initial crashing sound to the right of the trail, but after about 10 minutes of waiting I was hearing something about 75 yards to the left of  the trail. Peering through a strand of trees and some thick ground cover, I noticed some movement behind a boulder in a distant clearing. It was either a dancing squirrel or moose ears twitching the flying bugs away. As it turned out, it was the latter. The large animal continued moving along in the clearing grazing on something. This one appeared a lighter shade of brown than the one I saw before. It also looked bigger from my vantage point. I was hoping it would turn my way, but it just continued creeping along parallel to the trail. I waited for it to pass through the most open view point before taking a picture. Still the resolution was poor.I posted it anyway.Trust me though, it was much more exciting through human eyes. After the encounter, I continued to move along slowly in hopes of getting an even better view.
I passed several ponds and bogs on the way to ME Route 4. When I hit the road,I took a left and walked for a 1/4 mile to the Hiker Hut Hostel, operated by Steve and Catherine. The quaint little hole-in-the-wood is quite rustic. There is no electricity or phone service. There is a kitchen/office area, a medium-size bunkhouse and several small private huts dispersed around the property. The bunkhouse was full so I took one of the private huts. Which Way would have loved this and the little town of Rangeley, located about 10 miles west of the Trail. After taking an outdoor shower (heated with propane) down by the stream, I got a ride from Catherine to where I hung out most of day, eating, resupplying and planning my final couple of weeks on the trail (hard to believe). 
The little town of Rangeley sits in the midst of several lakes and ponds. It derives it’s name from an Englishman, Squire James Rangeley, who inherited a 31,000-acre (130 km2) tract bought from Massachusetts in 1796 by his father. He arrived in 1825 to establish an estate. Tenant farmers produced hay, wheat, oats, barley and potatoes, with cattle grazing the hills. Logging became a principal industry, with booms of logs towed by steamboat across the Rangeley lakes, then guided down rivers in log drives. Timber and other goods were shipped to markets, and tourists arrived from the large east coast cities. Consequently, the region developed in the 1900s into a seasonal resort area with camps, cabins, summer homes, inns and hotels. Today it is most definitely a tourist town.
Steve picked me up at the local ice cream stand at 7PM. He dropped me by the IGA to pick up some hiker food on the way back to the hostel. One thing was missing today that made me very happy—my post hike hobble. That’s a good thing because I have a few tough days of trekking ahead. It is raining now and the forecast is calling for 1-2 inches tonight and the same tomorrow. That should add to the fun!

Catherine had some coffee and an egg sandwich for me when I strolled over to the kitchen area at around 0730. Only one other hiker was stirring. I asked Catherine if they had a hiker stamp for my AT Passport and she just smiled and asked me to bring it to her. She then proceeded to draw me a stamp by hand. How unique. Steve offered me a ride back to the trail. It was 0845 when he dropped me off and it was still raining.
The hike up Saddleback Mountain was a 2,000’ ascent spread over 4 miles. It rained hard at times, but had tapered to a drizzle by the time I reached the top. The mile leading up to and after the summit were  above tree line. Unfortunately the views today were limited. Just before reaching the summit I ran into a SOBO hiker. It was Atlas, who Which Way and I met while hiking out of the NOC. He was hiking with his son-in-law then. Atlas had hiked NOBO to Harpers Ferry and then took an extended family vacation. Now he was flipping and finishing his hike SOBO. He said that he and his wife follow our Journal. I reminded Atlas that he commented the day we saw him that everyday was a leg day. So true!
I stopped for lunch at the summit using my ground cloth to shield my food from the rain. Next came The Horn and Saddleback Junior. The rain stopped as I hiked off of Saddleback, but the trail remained wet for the duration of the hike. Large puddles and running water in the trail made it impossible for my shoes to dry out. My gas tank emptied quickly and I struggled to get up and especially down the last two mountains. It seemed as if every rock and root was positioned in a way that thwarted forward progress. After several wipeouts, near misses, and steps in the mud I found myself getting angry at the AT. Why can’t I just finish this thing strong with time to reflect on the entire journey? Shouldn’t the excitement build inside of me as I draw closer to Katahdin? Instead, I can’t even think past the next mile, or next step for that matter.
I stumbled into the Popular Ridge Lean-to a little past 5PM. As much as I wanted to go on, I knew my day was over. Two female hikers were already at the shelter and I immediately started venting about the trail. I caught myself spewing negativity after a minute and excused myself to go get water and rinse the mud off my shoes and body.
Now I’m venting with you guys.  Sorry about that. I just really want these last two weeks to be an awesome end to an amazing journey. I also want to make it to Baxter by the 19th in time to link up with Which Way. I know she will be expecting me then, as she should. I just hope I’m in one piece. Still clinging to the hope that I will get a Zero day at Monson.  Until then, I need to just take what the trail gives me.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599441,"It seems that I had a bit of pity party hangover when I woke up this morning. After finishing up the downer journal entry, I went about my morning chores. I poured hot water from my pot into a ziplock freezer bag containing oatmeal and a heap of butter. Then I added some coffee to the water still in the pot. Somewhere during my oats and coffee breakfast I decided I needed an attitude adjustment. It was time to get back to embracing whatever the trail gives me. Time to start looking for opportunities to learn, grow, and excel in every situation. If a yellow brick road led me to Katahdin, then it wouldn’t be much of an accomplishment to make it there. So, I’ll consider it a privilege to have a rocky, rooty and muddy path the rest of the way. If it rains every day for the next two weeks, I’ll enjoy the sights and sounds of the forest that surrounds me; like the myriad of mushrooms I have been coming across the past few days. They come in all shapes, sizes, and colors. Or how about the dozens of frogs I see every day? And when I get a sunny day, a clear view from a  vista, or a soft trail, I will give thanks.
After I finished breakfast and my kick in the “fourth point of contact” I finished packing up and hit the trail at 0800 after I apologized for spewing negativity to the two hikers who shared the shelter with me last night. From the lean-to, the trail commenced a steep decline to Orberton Stream. I passed by a few hikers coming up the hill and they warned me that I would have to ford the swollen stream. I decided to leave my muddy shoes on, seeing it as an opportunity to clean them up a bit. In spots, the swift moving cold water was over my knees. Nonetheless, I made it to the other bank in short order. Once there I took off my shoes and rang out my socks and let my shoes and feet dry for a few minutes. Immediately after the stream crossing the trail began the 1,700’ ascent up Lone Mountain. The first few hundred yards of the climb was very steep and filled with large rocks to maneuver over and around. With my new and improved attitude I just floated right through it. After the initial craziness, the trail moderated in grade and texture. About halfway up the mountain I started seeing signs of moose. A game trail cut through a grassy area to the right of the AT. The whole area was thick with vegetation. I paused for a minute and then over to my right front I saw a big dark blob about 75 yards out. It could just be a boulder or a downed tree stump, but rocks and trees don’t move! The big blob moved on stilted legs headed diagonally towards the trail above me. Imagine a triangle, where I am at one point, the moose is at another, and where an imaginary line from the moose’s snout to the intersection of the AT was the third point. The large specimen dipped out of sight as it continued to slowly move forward, grazing along the way. When it did, I crept my way up to the third point on the triangle. Once I found a good vantage point I stood and waited for about 15 minutes. I never saw or heard another sign of Mr. Moose. I eased my way up and over Lone Mountain eventually arriving at the Spaulding  Mountain Lean-to. With the exception of a couple of busy squirrels, the spot was empty. It was a good place to get water and eat lunch while my feet and shoes aired out a bit.
I hit the trail again around 2PM and started a steep climb up Spaulding Mountain.   Next came Sugar Loaf Mountain. The AT crossed both peaks below their summit. A side trail led to the top of each peak, but I felt I needed to keep moving to make camp at a decent time. Both mountains stand over 4,000 feet. I believe there are a total of 76 peaks over 4K in New England. It is a thing to “bag” all of the peaks. As such, I saw several day hikers making their way up to the peaks via the AT. I stopped and chatted with several of them as well as a few SOBOs and Flip Floppers. I hadn’t seen any NOBOs since hitting the trail yesterday. The trail worked its way around the side of Sugar Loaf, opening up to some great views among the Alpine dwarf evergreens. One spot offered a spectacular view of the Rapid Stream Valley and Abraham Mountain. At another spot I got a glimpse of the Carrabassett Valley and Crocker Mountains (tomorrow’s climbs). Then came the steepest descent of the day, down to the Carrabassett River. It was as if there was a boulder explosion on the side of the mountain. Of course, the AT went right through it. I had fun picking my way through the maze of rocks. 
A foot board was anchored between two rocks on the river, making it an easy crossing. From there I climbed the first mile of South Crocker Mtn to the Crocker Cirque Campsite. I ended up “stealthing” at a spot right next to the AT, where it intersected with the blue blaze leading to the camp site. It was dusk by the time I pitched my tent and fixed dinner. While I was eating, five NOBOs came by. All but one headed to the top of the mountain. One young lady had an August 15th flight booked out of Boston. She and her two friends had to average 22 miles a day between here and Katahdin and had only a one day window to summit. I feel a little better about my plan now.
It was more of the same terrain today as yesterday. The difference was a little sunshine and a whole lot better attitude. Let’s see if I can keep it up on the rest of the muddy, rocky, and rooty path to Mt K.
Big, big day tomorrow. I bet you will never guess what it is.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599535,"What a great day! It was the kind of day that reminded me that I am a very blessed man. I woke up in the wilderness of Maine...a blessed man for sure. I hiked over the Crocker Mountains...another blessing...I was in awe of the uniqueness and hardiness of alpine vegetation...blessed all the more. I overcame the daily challenges of the AT unscathed...always a blessing. I hit the 2,000 mile (2KM) mark of an amazing journey...blessings mounting. I was able to share over half of the journey with my soulmate...blessed beyond words. The blessing of all blessings on this day is the culmination of 30 years of joy.  Today marks 30 years since Which Way said “I Do” to taking all of her Next Steps with me—a blessed man for sure. 30 Year Anniversary (30YA). Now that’s a feat!!!
So, the hiking was good, but the journey with the love of me life surpasses it all. It was bound to be a great day indeed. I floated over South and North Crocker, pausing to chat with southbound hikers. I had a particularly nice chat with a young lady named Erin. She passed by my tent sight on her way to bag the Crocker’s (2 of Maine’s fourteen 4,000 footers). She was on the way back down when I ran into her on South Crocker. Had two other nice chats with two separate Flip Flop Duos. It always makes me miss the other half of my duo when I see other couples hiking together.Still, I am happy for them and wish them well. 
It was a long descent from North Crocker to ME Route 27, where my hike would end. Reception was good so I had a nice long chat with Which Way while I maneuvered around mud holes, slipped over roots, and negotiated tricky rocks. I tried to describe all of the peculiar mushrooms I was seeing. The best part, she stayed on the phone with me until I hit the 2,000 mile mark. My biggest (and most important) fan was celebrating on the other end even more than I was on this end (I tend to be a bit reserved in moments like this). We talked about how long ago it seems like it was since we hit the 1,000 mile mark together. It made me realize just how big an accomplishment that was for her, for us. 
Once I made it to the highway it took about 10 minutes to catch a ride to Stratton. A friendly lady named Judy stopped to pick me up. She had some live tropical fish she had just purchased riding in the front seat. She was trying to find a place for them until I offered to hold them. Offer accepted.
Judy dropped me at the Post Office where I picked up a resupply box sent from WW. Another blessing to have someone who knows just what I need! Of course, she had a sweet little Anniversary Card inside the box. Perfect timing indeed.  Lunch at the General Store, shower, laundry, dinner, etc., etc.
Okay sports fans, coverage  will likely be spotty on the final leg of the journey and the distances between battery recharge will get longer. Plus, I will need to put a priority on getting hiking hours in (without sacrificing sleep as I usually tend to do). I will do my best to keep you updated on my progress and upload at least one pic. However, that may be all that I am able to manage on some of the days ahead. When I get an opportunity I will upload additional pics as needed. Thanks for understanding.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599694,"It was a short walk from the White Wolf Inn to the General Store. I stopped in around 0530 to eat breakfast and grab a cup of coffee. It was 0545 when I stepped out on ME 27 and stuck my thumb out and had a ride within 30 seconds from a mountain biker driving a pickup. I knew then that it would be a good day. Jarred dropped me off at 0600 and I was on my way. Storms were in the forecast for the afternoon and I wanted to get over the Bigelow Range before they hit. 
The first order of business was a 2,500’ ascent up North Horn Mountain. After crossing Cranberry Stream the trail sloped gently upwards for about 2 miles. I passed a sign on a tree marking the 2,000 mile point. It must have been placed there 4-5 years ago when the trail was a little shorter. It is off by about 3 miles now. Shortly after passing a beaver bog I came to Horns Pond Lean-to. Hydro and some of his counterparts from the Maine Appalachian Trail Club (MATC) recently constructed a new privy here. I stopped to “inspect” it. Good job Hydro! After Horns Pond the grade steepened and I made a final push to the summit of the North Horn Mountain. From there the trail descended about 500’ then ascended another 1,000’ to the Bigelow West Peak. Before the climb started I heard a rumble of thunder. Hmm, it’s early. I checked the radar and it looked like the storm was going to slide just to the north. I put the rain cover on my pack for insurance. A brief sprinkle is all that came from it. The climb up the West Peak was spread over 1.7 miles. The final 1/2 mile was very steep and rocky. Before long, the granite summit rose above the Dwarf Spruce. Above tree line the wind picked up and the air cooled. The Peak was just 4,150’ high, but when I worked my way up the final heap of rocks it felt as if I was approaching the top of the world. The views in all directions were spectacular!
Looking south I could see the Crockers and Sugarloaf Mtn. To the north was Flagstaff Lake. If you pull up a map of Maine and find the section that the AT passes through, you will find a lot of water. Impressive on a map. To see it all from above is indescribable! Looking east beyond the rocky ridge was the next mountain to conquer, Avery Peak. It is the last of the 4,000 footers heading north until Katahdin. 
I stopped at the saddle between the two peaks for lunch then worked my way to the top of Avery Peak. More amazing views. This is what it is all about for me. Laboring up the mountains on a steamy morning make the experience on the summit so much more meaningful. God is good! I saw a boulder with a plaque stand just below the summit of Avery Peak. It is to honor Myron H. Avery (1899-1952), a forefather of the AT.  
From Avery Peak Little Bigelow Mountain can be seen in the distance. It was a 2 mile, 1,800’ descent to Stafford Notch, where I walked among huge boulders. From the notch it was another 2 mile, 800’ climb to Little Bigelow. The trail continued along the ledges of Little Bigelow for about a mile. The sound of thunder warned  of an approaching storm. It was a 1.6 mile, 1,200’ drop to the Little Bigelow Lean-to. I made it to the blue blaze trail leading to the lean-to at 4:30PM. The trail crossed a stream where I filled my dirty bag up. The rain came just seconds after I ducked in the lean-to. I love it when a plan comes together!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599862,"Which Way and I lived in Indianapolis a few years ago. While we were there we met a terrific young man named Nolan. He was a student at Butler University, which was a long way from his home in Austin, TX. We were blessed that Nolan allowed us to “adopt” him as our own. Nolan was a bright and musically gifted young man with a smile as big as Texas. He brought a lot of joy into our lives. We spent many days together in worship and fellowship, hiking, camping, playing games, and just spending time with this uniquely awesome young man. Not  long after we moved from Indy to DC, 3 years ago to the month, Nolan’s mom called with the sad news that Nolan’s life ended tragically young. Needless to say, we were devastated by the news, but we will always cherish the time we had with Nolan. We have since built a relationship with Nolan’s parents. A couple of days ago, Nolan’s dad contacted me to let me know that Nolan’s Uncle Dave and Aunt Theresa lived in Maine and were interested in doing some trail magic for me.  He passed along my number and location and two days ago I got a text from Dave. As it turns out, he and Theresa own an off-the-grid cabin just 2.5 miles from the trail. So, we made a plan to rendezvous at Scott Road today. As I was walking to meet my Trail Angel it dawned on me that Nolan continues to bring joy to my life. 
I was hiking by 0630 and the trail for the first few miles out of the Lean-to was soft and easy. At least for a bit, I was following the brown dirt path to Katahdin. I eventually hit the shore of Flagstaff Lake, the first of many large bodies of water I would hike around today. West Carry Pond came next. I found a good spot there for lunch. Shortly after I started moving again, I came to a sign indicating that I was entering into “The Great Carrying Place”. In 1775 COL Benedict Arnold led 1,000 men on an attack of Quebec. His force crossed over West Carry Pond and portaged 13 miles between the Dead and Kennebec Rivers. The AT between West and Middle Carry Ponds exactly follows the portage route. I didn’t see anyone with muskets, but I did see a hiker with a fly fishing rod. Two brothers from Georgia—Tree Breaker and Fish Fry—are SOBOs hiking the trail. I met Tree Breaker first. He was a pleasant and respectful young man (yes sir this and yes sir that). Not far behind I met Fish Fry. He was actually hiking with his fly rod in hand. Evidentially, he has had several good catches along the way. The were both fine young fellows.
After crossing over a section of mud, slippery rocks, and roots (gotta keep it real), I was back on soft trail again. It was like this for the most all the way to Scott Road. I arrived a half hour earlier than our designated link up time. It gave me just enough time to stretch and jot down notes from the hike.
David and Theresa are both Structural Engineers living in North Yarmouth, ME. They came here out of college looking for work after the oil crash of the 1980’s. They never left. Theresa was unable to make it, but Dave drove 130 miles from their house. He arrived with a cold Mountain Dew and and a cooler full of food. We made our way from the gravel logging road, to a dirt road, to a grass covered road that led into his property. They had literally built a cabin in the middle of the woods. Off the front porch is a view down to Lake Flagstaff with the Bigelows rising from the far shore. Perfect!
Dave grilled steaks and fixed up some asparagus, beans, and warm bread to go with it. For dessert we had blueberry pie. Everything was delicious! Dave and I talked into the night about the trail, the cabin, life, family and faith. It was as if we had known each other for a very long time. We finished off the day with a phone call to Nolan’s dad.
Once again I went to sleep wondering how tomorrow could ever follow a day like today on the AT?!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599951,"Dave was doing his part to make sure today followed yesterday. He fixed me an omelet that filled half my plate. Soon thereafter he had me back to the trail and sent me on my way. Once again I am amazed at the generosity on display along the AT. Dave took it as a personal mission that I was in want of nothing during our brief stay together. He accomplished that mission with flying colors. I hope our paths cross again sometime. In the meantime, I pray that  Dave and his family be blessed in full.
It was 0830 when I started hiking and I actually had a deadline to meet today. The Kennebec River was 8 miles up trail and the only way across the river was by ferry (actually a canoe). The ferry runs from 9-2 daily. Fortunately most of the trail was fairly flat and smooth and I arrived before noon. I crossed a boggy stream early in the hike and spooked some loons into flight. A hiker named Sunshine came up as I was scanning the banks of the bog for any other signs of life. I had met her once before, several hundred miles back on the trail. She is hiking with a fellow named Beast who was not far behind. Sunshine and I ended up hiking together for the next four miles. I must say that the miles fly by when carrying on a conversation with another hiker. I stopped at Pierce Pond to take some pictures and get a snack. Sunshine moved on, but I would pass her a little further down the trail when she stopped to wait for Beast.
After leaving the pond, the trail followed along the Cascading Pierce Stream for several miles. A thunderstorm moved in and hung around for a few minutes. Parts of the trail were a bit muddy, with lots of roots and slippery rocks. No complaints here. The trail also passed between Coniferous and Deciduous Forests.
I reached the Kennebec River at 1145 and waited for the Canoe Ferry to paddle over from the far side. Another hiker from the UK came down a minute later. Sunshine and Beast arrived just as the canoe reached the shore. Today the Kennebec was running swift and high. At times it is lower and hikers in the past have tempted fate by fording the river. However, this is very risky because an upstream dam can release water without notice causing the water level to rise 2-3 feet. Just this spring a hiker was swept to his death trying to ford the dangerous river. A White Blaze is painted on the inside of the canoe, denoting it as the official method of crossing the Kennebec. Sunshine took some pictures of Honeybun and I crossing the river. I waited on the other side to return the favor. 
Just a short walk up the trail from the river is a road crossing. A side road leads .3 miles to the small town of Caratunk. The Caratunk House is situated in the middle of town. It is a hiker B&B with a nice resupply store. They also offer pulled pork BBQ sandwiches and milkshakes. I’ll take two sandwiches and a chocolate shake, please and thank you. I had reserved a room for tonight, but decided to hike on since it was early and I still had 36 miles between me and Monson. I gave my room up to Sunshine and Beast and moved on after a couple of hours. It was a steady 6 mile climb to the Pleasant Pond Lean-to. A couple of hikers were already occupying the sides of the 6-Man shelter so I took up the space in the middle. It is dark now and a loon is calling out. Cool!
The weather looks good for the next few days. Let’s hope it is the onset of a new trend. Another glorious day on the AT in the books.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600089,"It was a gorgeous day and fitting that the first climb was up Pleasant Mountain. The 1,100’ ascent was a relatively easy one in the cool morning air. A brisk wind at the summit made it a little nippy. I took advantage of the first good signal in awhile to load pics and call WW. From Pleasant Mtn it was 7 miles to the Bald Mountain Brook Lean-to. The stretch was mostly downhill and included a walk beside Moxie Pond. The trail crossed  Baker Stream just above the top of the  pond. The feeder stream was listed as a ford, but I was able to rock hop without too much difficulty. 
Feeling a little deplete of energy I stopped at the Lean-to for an early lunch.  Next up was the 1,300’ climb up Moxie Bald. The trail passed through some huge boulder formations and by some caves during the ascent. The granite mountain rose above the trees for the final 1/2 mile stretch. A cool breeze kicked in again and I felt as though I was walking to the sky. The top of the Moxie Bald (properly referred to as Big Bald Mountain) is mostly barren as a result of a forest fire in the early 1900s. To me it looks like a graveyard for Spruce Trees. The views from the top were spectacular in every direction. I could see back to the Bigelows and Moxie Pond and forward to the ponds and mountains ahead. The blueberries at the top were also plump, juicy, and delicious. I stopped every 100 yards or so to pick off a few of the tasty all natural treats. 
It was a fairly steep descent down to the Bald Mountain Pond Lean-to. From here it is 18 miles to ME Rte 76 (Monson). It was still early so I decided to hike 9 more miles to the next shelter, cutting my hike tomorrow in half. Easier said than done. Although there were stretches of nice flat terrain, I also encountered two streams that required fording. The first was the Bald Mountain, the outlet for Bald Mountain Pond. I removed my mostly dry hiking shoes, put on my camp sandals (Zeros), and waded through the ankle to knee-deep water. On the other side I swapped out shoes again. The whole process takes about 15-20 minutes to cover just 20 yards. Between the Bald Mtn. Stream and The West Branch of the Piscataquis River,  the terrain was fairly flat and easy. On the ford across this stream,  the water was up to my thighs in places. The trail followed the final 3 miles, cutting up and snaking down the side of the canyon along the way. The going was slow and tedious.
I arrived at the Horseshoe Canyon Lean-to at around 6:30, 12 hours after my hiking day began. I was alone at the 8-person shelter when I arrived. Another hiker showed up at dark and pitched a tent.   I saw him earlier in the day and he told me he was unable to get up Katahdin on the first try and that it took him 20 days to get through the 100 mile wilderness. For the past several weeks he has been hiking back and forth on this section trying to get in shape. He said he is ready now to hike Mount K and continue his SOBO hike to Georgia. Now that’s determination.
The temperature dropped quickly after sunset. I zipped up the foot box and cinched up the straps on my quilt and crawled inside. I was tired after a pleasant yet long day on the AT. The journal would have to wait until the morning.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600152,"I talked to Next Step around 8:30 this morning while I was walking at the local park. He let me know that he was only about 9 miles from Monson and that he was hoping for a day of rest (except for the 9 mile walk and hiker chores, of course). So you guys are stuck with me today. He wanted me to let you know that his hike this morning was good, but pretty uneventful. That said, he is excited about starting the 100 Mile Wilderness TOMORROW!  He decided to forego a Zero in Monson to give him more time to spend on the trail. With 8 days to cover 110 miles he is satisfied that he won’t feel rushed to get through it. The final stretch before KATAHDIN!!!! I am beyond excited for him! I can’t even imagine how he must be feeling by now. As he mentioned before, I will be flying to Boston next Saturday and will drive up to Baxter State Park on Sunday. Weather permitting, we will SUMMIT KATAHDIN on Monday, the 20th!!!!!!!!!! His 29 year dream will come to fruition and I know he is feeling blessed beyond measure to have been given this opportunity to see it through. Obviously, it would have been even better if we could have done the whole journey together, but it’s okay. I’m just so thankful I got to do half of it and I get to be there to see him finish. That makes my heart smile just to think about. After spending 1,000 miles on the AT with him, I truly “get it” when I read his entries every day and I know, that even as beautiful and breathtaking as all the pictures are that he posts, they’re nothing compared to seeing it in person! If it works out, I’ll get to see it for myself over the next few years when I go back and hike the last half!
I’ve been having a wonderful time while I sit on the sidelines. I got to surprise our daughter with an earlier-than-planned trip to Colorado. A couple of weeks ago, she thought she and her boyfriend, Ian, were going to the airport to pick up his roommate, but they were really there to pick me up. The look on her face was PRICELESS! We had an AMAZING week together getting her ready for her last semester of college- just hanging out, cooking together, playing lots of Catan (with her and Ian), binge watching some tv shows,  and of course, shopping and LOTS of laughing!! Next Step and I will go on a MEGA road trip when he finishes the AT to visit ALL of our family, so I’ll get to see her and Ian again soon and we’ll get to spend some time with our son and his sweet wife as well! That helped to make it not quite so hard to leave. 
As you know, I’ve also been spending time with my precious parents in Kentucky. We’ve cooked together, shopped, and had some “fun” games of Triominoes ( which I always lose, thus, the quotation marks!!)  My mom and I work the Daily Crossword Puzzle together almost every evening. One of the highlights of my time with them has been having them teach me how to can tomato juice. My dad raises a BEAUTIFUL garden every year and all summer, we’ve been enjoying DELICIOUS veggies every night for supper. But I really am hoping to have my own garden next year, now that we’ll finally be able to live in one spot long enough to make that happen. I wanted to be able to can my own tomato juice. So this was the perfect time to learn! And I ended up absolutely loving the process! (Now, I can’t really say that I enjoyed canning the whole tomatoes quite as much. If you’ve ever done it, you’ll understand what I’m talking about). But at least I can say I could do it if I HAD to. I’m thinking the canned whole tomatoes at Kroger taste just fine to me. Lol I’ve also been collecting zinnia flowers out of his garden to dry, so that I can plant those in my yard next year as well. My dad has two green thumbs, for sure. So I’m hoping that some of that will rub off on me! But mostly, he puts lots of love, sweat and prayers into it and I’m pretty sure, that’s the true secret:-) 
And of course another highlight is that I’ve enjoyed being able to talk to the kiddos any time I want! Not to mention that I’ve had running water and flushable toilets! I’ve been able to change clothes 5 times a day (no, I don’t really do that, but it’s nice to know that I can!). I have a real mattress to sleep on. I not only have a plethora of hair products to choose from (and I haven’t had to open a shampoo packet with my teeth in two months!!) but I have a whole drawer of make-up to wear every day, and 4 different bottles of perfume to choose from!!! But I would go back to wearing the same clothes every day and give up all of my other “luxuries” in .3 seconds if I could have my back working again and be able to hike with my Next Step!!! Oh, how I miss that man! But we’ll be together soon, just the way we’re supposed to be!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600378,"For years I have dreamed about hiking through Maine’s 100-Mile Wilderness. Today I crossed the threshold and began the final leg of my AT journey. Somebody pinch me!
As Which Way mentioned, I spent yesterday afternoon in Monson. The small town is located on Route 15 which is a somewhat major route north to the well-known Moosehead Lake Region, to which Monson is sometimes considered a gateway. This route eventually leads to the Canadian Province of Quebec. Monson is also the last town located near the AT and is the gateway to the 100-Mile Wilderness for NOBOs. I stayed at Shaws Hostel while in Monson. Poet and Hippy Chick, the proprietors, are great. WW sent me a re-supply to the hostel so I did not have to do much in the way of shopping. That left me more time to eat. I hit the local gas station with a pizza oven for lunch. That might hold me over until  dinner. The local BBQ joint has a prime rib special on Saturday nights. I ordered up a big, juicy and delicious cut of meat, a salad, roasted potatoes, and a large piece of cornbread that tasted more like dessert. A sweet lady named Bonnie who has been following our trail journal also left  me a package at Shaws. It had a load of hiker treats in it. I ate a bunch of it, packed what I could, and gave the rest to a couple of hikers in need.
Before taking off this morning I weighed myself and my pack. To my surprise I was down to under 170 lbs. That is 10 pounds lighter than the last time I weighed in and makes a total of 25 lbs that I have lost since starting the trail. Must eat more pizza, prime rib, and ice cream. 
Poet and Hippy Chick did their part to get my calorie count up. They fixed up eggs to order, bacon, fried potatoes and all you can eat blueberry pancakes. Yummy!
After breakfast I weighed my pack with and without food and water. My base weight (without food and water) was 15lbs. Add 5 days of food and 2ltrs of water and I was up to 32 pounds. I guess I will just have to eat my way to a lighter pack.
I took the 0900 shuttle back  to the trail and was hiking into the wilderness. THE 100-Mile Wilderness. It runs from the spot I entered the forest to Abol Bridge,  just south of Baxter State Park. It is generally considered the wildest section of the AT and one of the most challenging to navigate and traverse. It consists of a small corridor of protected wilderness surrounded by large tracts of public and private land controlled by paper companies. An increasing amount of the adjoining lands are being protected by groups like the Appalachian Mountain Club and the Nature Conservancy.
In 2000, a series of new logging roads and a marked side-trail offered hikers re-supply and lodging opportunities between miles 55 and 65 heading northbound from Monson. This commercial refuge is not officially recognized by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and has been controversial since it became accessible. Hikers also have the option of having Shaws or another supplier to deliver a cache of re-supply items to a predesignated location. I began this section with 5 days of provisions and will resupply at Whitehouse Landing, about 60 miles in. More on that later. 
Not long after entering into the 100-Mile Wilderness, the sound of automobiles traveling  along ME 15 began to wane. I passed three ponds in as many miles and saw plenty frogs and mushrooms. I also saw a snake, the 4th one in the past  5 days.
After stopping for an early lunch and stretch at Leeman Brook Lean-to, I hit the trail and soon came to the nicest pond of the day. North Pond had an island in the middle of it and it stretched beyond my field of vision. 
As I came up from an excursion to the pond, a couple hiking SOBO walked up. The wife, Laura (Butterfly) asked if I was Next Step. Her and her husband, Kevin (Huckleberry), have been following our journal. Huckleberry sent me a note about a week ago letting me know they were hiking from Katahdin and that our paths might cross. Huckleberry and Butterfly are from Thousand Oaks, California. They started hiking the AT in 2014 and made it to Carlisle, PA before a life event interrupted their journey. They are finishing what they started this year. Good for them. They are documenting their hike on trailjournals.com. Give them a shout out. Butterfly told me that our journal was inspiring couples to hike together. I don’t know about that, but I am happy if that is the case. I’m a firm believer that couples should find recreational activities that they can experience together.
After chatting with Huckleberry and Butterfly for at least a half hour I got back to hiking again. A moderate climb took me up to Bear Pond Ledges. Down the other side I came to Little Wilson Falls. The powerful falls thundered into a canyon. After leaving the falls there were several other small rises and falls in the terrain. The trail came to Big Wilson Stream, where I had to ford through knee deep water. Not much further up the trail I came to Wilson Valley Lean-to. At 6:30 I was the first to arrive. Four SOBOs eventually showed up.
It was a good first day in the wilderness.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600379,"My first full day in the 100-Mile Wilderness was amazing. To start, it was a nearly perfect weather day. By most standards, 75 degrees and sunny is perfect. But for hiking, it is a tad bit on the warm side. I’ll take it though. Especially since the morning started out nice and cool. The first few hours of hiking took me across several pretty mountain streams and by two waterfalls. I stopped at the Long Pond Stream Lean-to for a quick snack and stretch. Next up was a hike across the Chairback Range. There were a total of four mountains to be conquered. 
As is usually the case, the first climb was the steepest. It was a 1,700’ ascent up Barren Mountain. A little over halfway through the climb there was a short spur trail to Barren Ledges. The rocky outcropping afforded a spectacular view down to Boarstone Mountain and Lake Onawa. To the northeast I was able to see the main peak of Barren Mountain. I hiked to the top and ate lunch at the base of an old fire tower. Yes, I am continuing to eat my way to a lighter pack. 
Next up was Chairback Forth Mountain and then Chairback Third Mountain. At the top of Chairback Third Mountain a SOBO pointed out that there were some sticks on the ledge spelling out 2-1-0-0. Say what??? 2,100 miles! This marks the last century milestone. There will be a lot of “lasts” in the coming days. For instance, if all goes according to plan, tomorrow will be my last Tuesday on the trail. The last climb for today was up Columbus Mountain. Just before the ascent started I crossed a stream where I filled my Platypus “dirty bag” with 3L of water. I was getting reports that the water source at the next lean-to was iffy, so I decided to go ahead and get some. At 2.5 lbs per liter, it put my backpack on the heavy side for the final 1.8 miles up and over Columbus Mountain. 
I arrived at the Chairback Gap Lean-to at around 6PM. It is getting dark earlier with each passing day, so I had just enough time to take care of business while I still had daylight. A German Hiker named Trekmate is sharing the shelter with me. He is the first NOBO I have seen since entering the 100-Mile Wilderness. 
Tomorrow I hike up the last mountain of the Chairback Range and then hit the Whitecap Range. If the weather is good, there may be a special view atop Whitecap Mountain. Stay tuned!
Peace and Blessings!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600498,"Trekmate left his gas stove and wind shield on the shelter floor about 2 feet from my head. At about 0400 I woke up to the sound of a mouse messing around inside the aluminum wind shield. I flashed my headlamp in that direction and the critter went scurrying for cover inside the shelter wall. A minute later I heard the fury, four-legged creature making his way back to the kitchen. Once again, I lit up his playground and he ran out of the rectangular slot at the bottom of the circular shield and headed for the walls. This went on until about 0500 when I decided to get on up. 
I was hiking by 0600 and knocked out the last Chairback by 0700. The clouds were thick grey and it was drizzling at the summit. The descent through a huge rock (boulder) slide was a little tricky. Then it was back in the woods with the roots and smaller rocks. This continued for about four miles where the trail crossed a wide knee-deep stream. On the far bank, the trail widened and softened. Ahhh! The trail remained nice for another 1.5 miles. My feet didn’t know how to act. 
The elevation at the stream crossing was 650 feet. The AT would gain 3,000 feet in altitude over the next 12 miles. At the top stood White Cap Mountain (3,644’). The first 6 miles was a steady gain of about 1,300’.  I stopped at a lean-to for lunch before tackling the final 6 miles to the top. White Cap was only part of the story.
It was the last of four peaks in front of me—a four-headed beast. Although White Cap was only 1,700 feet higher in elevation than the lean-to, the total ascent was around 2,700 feet, with a 1,000 foot cumulative drop between peaks. Fresh off of lunch I climbed 700 feet, dispensing of the first peak, Gulf Hagas Mountain, in short order. After a 250 foot drop, it was a steep 850 foot ascent to the top of West Peak. Two down, two to go! A quick 400 feet down and 500 up and I was standing on the third mountain. Realizing that he had been conquered, Hay Mountain wept. The rain would continue for the rest of the day, making the rocks and roots very slippery. After a 250 foot descent, it was a 750 foot climb to the top of White Cap. The initial 500 feet was very steep causing me to employ my secret weapon—Skittles! As I popped a handful of the pure sugar fuel in my mouth I was reminded of a dream I had last week. I dreamt that I was getting a post-hike physical check-up, the physician, who was more like a Witch Doctor, told me to “open wide” and then stuck his gnarly hands in my mouth. He then asked me if I had been eating Skittles. I replied, “a few.” To which he informed me that I had 6 cavities. I woke up just as he approached with a carpenter’s drill, once again telling me to “open real wide.”
Where was I? Oh yeah, the Skittles got me up the initial climb and the trail continued about a half mile along a ridge before the final ascent. On the ridge I came across a Spruce Grouse hen and her chick.They meandered their way up the trail for another 25 yards before exiting into the woods. Jumping grouse has been a daily occurrence of late, but the hen wasn’t flying anywhere without her baby. 
The final push was over the rocky top of White Cap. Realizing that I was victorious, she let out a cold wind, as if to say, “Get off my mountain top!” Supposedly there is a view to Mount Katahdin from White Cap on a clear day. I guess she decided not to reveal herself just yet. By the way, White Cap and the two peaks that preceded it were the last of the 3K+ mountains between here and Baxter State Park.
It was a steep descent of 1,200 feet over 1.4 miles from the summit of White Cap to the Logan Brook Lean-to. Two SOBOs came by me at just as I started down. These were the first two hikers I had seen on the trail all day. Moving. quickly now, I passed three other NOBOs on the way to the lean-to. When I got to the shelter there were three other hikers already there. One gal started her hike in Maryland and still hadn’t made up her mind whether she was going to flip or call it quits when she got to Katahdin. Another gal, Ninja, was a Triple Crowner from New Hampshire. She was just out for a “stroll” through the 100-mile Wilderness. The third hiker was also just hiking the 100-mile Wilderness. From the looks of his gear, he was a little out of his league. As soon as I arrived he asked me if I had a cigarette. Evidently he was trying to give up smoking out here and it wasn’t going very well. I ended up giving him some hot tea to calm his nerves. Later he said he wished he had some candy. I handed him what was left of my Skittles. They came with a warning, “Careful, they’ll rot your teeth out!”

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600582,"My pack was a serving of oatmeal and 30 Skittles lighter this morning. The food bag always feels heavy until one morning you pick it up and it feels light. That usually happens on re-supply day. But this time around it came a day early. The Skittles may well have been the tipping point. 
I hit the trail at around 0730 in no particular hurry. I only planned to hike about 11 miles to the Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to. That would leave me around 14 miles the next day to Whitehouse Landing. The air was still and trending towards the warm side when I took off. The trail continued its descent off of White Cap for two more miles, where it crossed a nice gravel road. A car was parked along the road close to the trail. It undoubtedly belonged to a couple of day hikers who passed by the lean-to when I was eating my breakfast. I would cross another gravel road before the end of the day. 100-mile Wilderness? 
The trail was very non-Maine-like (flat and smooth) for very long stretches today. The next two miles to the East Branch Lean-to were generally flat and passed through some old growth White Pines. With no wind and the moss covered terrain, I think peaceful best describes the setting. Every now and then I would stop and just listen. Eventually a bird or squirrel would break the silence and I would move on. I stopped at the lean-to for a snack and morning stretch. From the lean-to the trail started an easy 800’ climb up Little Boardman Mountain. This would be the only mountain for the day. I walked to the summit which was just over 2K. The last mountain over 2K until Katahdin. I could hear thunder rumbling ahead of me as I came off the summit.
At the base of Little Boardman the trail passed by Crawford Pond. It is a huge pond with sandy beaches in places. I contemplated going for a dip, but thought better of it when I saw a dark thundercloud forming above the opposite shore. I did eat my lunch on the beach though. I figured I could see the storm coming for over a mile as it crossed the water. I fixed up a couple of PBJ wraps and watched a Loon swimming just off shore and diving under the water in search of its own lunch. As I was starting my second wrap, I heard a thunderclap over my left shoulder. The storm was moving in from two directions now. I choked down the rest of my lunch and headed for the safety of the forest. The thunder was overhead and rain began to fall shortly after I crossed over the rocky pond outlet. It did not take long for the big drops of water to penetrate through the deciduous forest. The cool drops felt good on my warm skin and I delighted in the scent of the earth stirred by the rain. The trail was wonderfully soft and my pace picked up as the rain fell harder. A flash of lightning. Only one. It was mostly just thunder like a barking dog without a bite. Soon the sun added to the mix of rain and thunder. I peered through the canopy in search of the rainbow but there was none that I could see. 
It was 2:20PM when I arrived at the Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to. As the name suggests, the shelter sits right in front of a cascading stream emptying into a pool of water. It was very serene indeed. I went to the brook to catch some water in my dirty bag. As the water was filtering into the bladder I grabbed another snack and contemplated my next step. It is 11.4 miles to the next shelter and a couple of SOBOs told me that it was more smooth sailing for the next 10-12 miles. I could easily knock out 3 miles an hour on this terrain. As I was considering my options, a somewhat questionable character approached the shelter. He was a SOBO, but I wasn’t sure if he was staying put or moving on. It was the tipping point for me, I was moving on. I quickly disconnected the filter from the dirty bag that was hanging from a nail high on one of the shelter poles. I put my pack cover back on and I was off to the races. After covering a quick mile or so I tried to recall if I had removed the dirty bag and packed it up. I stopped, took off my pack, and opened the side pocket where my filtering system resides. No dirty bag! U-turn! I arrived at the lean-to about 15 minutes later. The bag was right where I left it. The shady dude was gone. Tipping point. Looks like I’m staying out right here. The good news is that it is that this journal entry is complete well before hiker midnight and I will be hitting the trail at dawn tomorrow. Thunder...good call!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600650,"No other hikers showed up at the lean-to last night, so I had the place all to myself. I was fast asleep by 8PM and the sound of Cooper Brook cascading into the pool of water in front of the shelter provided an excellent ambient sound to help me sleep through the night. I was up at dawn and hiking by 0600. When I slipped on my damp hiking shirt it was cool against my skin. It stayed cool under the canopy throughout the hike. The nice dry breeze made the conditions perfect. The trail was soft for the first several miles. Birch, Maple, Hickory and White Pines eventually gave way to a strand of old forest Red Pines. The forest floor was free of vegetation and every rock and fallen tree was covered with a velvety blanket of dark green moss. Mushrooms were sprouting from the moist ground in their usual array of whites, purples, reds, oranges, browns, and yellows. 
What’s this coming down the trail? A dog perhaps? Or maybe a coyote?  It was moving spryly over the rocks just about 40 yards up trail and headed my way. I froze. A second later it stopped too and looked my direction. I slipped  my hand into my hip belt pocket and pulled out my camera. I got a couple of shots off and waited to see if it would come closer. After a 30-second stand-off, the animal took a 90-degree turn and disappeared into the woods. Dark gray, big ears, pointy snout, and a large bushy tail. It was a gray fox! Much bigger than most of the red fox I see down south. I pulled up my camera to see how the pic turned out. No joy! It is times like this that my zoom lens would sure have come in handy.
Continuing along the trail I could  see Cooper Pond through the trees. A loon let out a tremelo (like a loud crazy laugh) at the sound of my approach. I stepped to the pond shore just in time to catch the loon in flight above the trees. Got a pic (albeit low quality) this time.
Man, I’m really taking a walk on the wild side. Can it get any better than this? Yes it can!
I came over a hill and the trail was back to its normal self again—mud, rocks and roots. I could see Pemadumcook Lake through the trees. Then I saw a sign pointing the way to a view of, wait for it...Mount Katahdin!!  Twenty steps later I was  standing on the rocky shore looking across the water at the most majestic mountain view thus far. It was 42 trail miles away, but I felt like I could reach out and touch it. I’ve tried not to get out ahead of myself, just taking things one day at a time. But, standing there in awe of Her Majesty, it all began to sink in. I’m doing this. I’m thru hiking the AT. Correction, I’m almost “through” hiking the AT!
The 14 miles to the .2 mile side trail to a small boat dock flew by. At 1230 I called the White House Landing Hostel and waited for my taxi. I did my post hike stretching and laid out on the small dock. Before I could catch any shut eye, my boat taxi arrived. Bill navigated the restored 1942 Lone Star around boulders protruding above the surface of the lake. A few minutes later we arrived at a quaint little lakeside retreat. White House Landings caters to hikers and fishermen in the summer months. In the winter they offer refuge to snowmobilers and ice fishermen. A main house and several cottages were nestled on the slope of a hill. Inside the main house I met Linda. She offered me a cold drink, a Whoopie Pie and handed me my final resupply box. I’m so thankful that Which Way has been sending me these boxes. It makes resupply day much easier. I hand washed my clothes, took a shower, cleaned up my gear and sorted through my box of goodies.  Before I knew it dinner was ready. Linda fixed up a nice cucumber and tomato salad and Bill brought out two ears of sweet corn for each guest. All of the vegetables come fresh from their garden. I ordered a delicious jalapeno cheese burger as my main course. It was one of the best burgers I have eaten on the trail. 
I’m hoping to get a few pics of the sunset and maybe capture a video of a Loon calling before Linda retrieves my phone and takes it to their house for a recharge. At least I got the journal typed up. It will be nice to once again go to sleep without that unfinished business hanging over my head. Getting the signal to upload is a different story.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600727,"I was up at dawn and all packed up by 0530. I walked up to the porch of the main building where breakfast would be served at 0700. The door was locked, so I sat on the porch and just took in the wakening of Pemadumcook Lake. Two hummingbirds made multiple visits to the porch to drink from the feeder and suck up the nectar from a pot of Pansies sitting at my feet. My phone/camera was still at Bill and Linda’s place being charged.
Bill showed up at around 0630, put coffee on and started breakfast—farm fresh eggs, bacon and AYCE blueberry pancakes. It was all very well prepared. There were four of us catching a ride back to the trail after we all settled our bill.  Unfortunately, one of the NOBOs was having trouble with his credit card and it was well after 0900 before he got everything in order and was ready to go. 
It was a quick 10 minute cruise in the Lone Star to the dock and we were all hiking again. The trail crossed a couple of streams in the first few miles that were listed in AWOL’s Guidebook as fords. However, I was able to rock hop over both with ease. It wasn’t long before the trail came to another large lake. The path circumnavigated the south shore of the Nahmakanta Lake. The trail was headed east to west here. Early on, the path  traveled along the gravel beach shore of the lake. Then it began cutting along the side of the mountains just above the lake. This meant lots of little dips and rises and the return of Maine roots. Just as the trail started climbing from the lake (elev. 650’) to the summit of Nesuntabunt Mountain (elev. 1,522’) it came to Wadleigh Stream Lean-to. I had originally considered stopping here for the day, but it was only 1230 when I arrived. So, I filtered some water, did some stretching, ate lunch and moved on. The path was full of roots and rocks as it for most of the day. That’s more like it! Large boulders were randomly strewn throughout the forest keeping the scenery interesting. The trail cut back to the south through a deep ravine, then turned back north following the steep ridge to the top.  A 200 foot side trail led to rock outcropping with a stunning view across the lake to Mount Katahdin. It stood just 16 mikes to east, but was still 35 trail miles away.
Not long after I started down the mountain I came across a SOBO Flip Flopper. He asked where I lived and I responded that I had just retired 30 years in the Army and that the AT was my home now. He said, “I recently retired after 30 years in the Army too.” He went on to say that he spent most of his time at Fort Bragg, to which I responded that I did three tours there. He mentioned that he lived in Pine Valley. I told him that we lived there from 2001-2006. I asked “DJ” his real name and then I asked him his wife and kids’ names. I recognized the name of his wife and daughter. I had signal and called Which Way. She immediately knew who I was talking about. Our daughters were friends and Which Way served on the PTA with DJs wife. Big trail, small world! DJ is hiking to raise money for the Johnny Mac Soldiers Fund. The fund supports surviving children of fallen Soldiers. DJ flipped at the Bear Mountain Bridge in NY. He appeared to be struggling a little and said that hiking for the fund is what keeps him going. Please keep DJ and the cause he is supporting in your prayers.
A little further down the north slope of Nesuntabunt Mtn the trail came across a rock providing another great view of Katahdin with the lake in the foreground. After clearing the lake, the AT worked its way its way around Crescent Pond. From there it rose along the rim of the Pollywag Gorge and crossed the Pollywag River on a logging road bridge.
The final two miles were along the cascading Rainbow Stream. I arrived at the lean-to at 6PM. Three other NOBO—Windjammer, Dirty Girl and Valkyrie—were already settled in when I arrived. Dirty Girl and Valkyrie are a mother and daughter from Denmark that I ran into way back when. Big trail, small world! It was dark by 7:30. That is when the rain started falling. Three other hikers rolled in well after dark. Just a bit annoying. Enough said.
Just 15 miles until I rendezvous with WW and 30 mikes to the top of Katahdin. Unbelievable!
Peace and Blessings!

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600786,"Today was intended to be my last full day in the 100-Mile Wilderness. It was also the day that Which Way would start working her way to Baxter State Park. The original plan was for me to hike to the 11.5 miles to the next shelter. Meanwhile WW would fly into Boston and drive for a few hours towards  Baxter State Park. I would then hike 3.5 miles out of the wilderness on Sunday morning, meet WW at a campground just outside of Baxter, then hike into the park together to the base of Katahdin. WW sent me her flight itinerary yesterday and I noticed her flight arrived in Boston a little after 5:30 pmThis meant that she could be in Millenocket, ME (the closest town to Baxter SP) around 11pm. I decided to give her a call when I got signal to see if she would prefer that I hike on out of the wilderness, catch a ride to Millenocket and meet her there. Just one issue, I didn’t have any phone service. I would just have to check periodically and hope for the best.
I started hiking along Rainbow Stream around 0800. It had rained all night and was still cloudy with some light showers when I stared hiking. The trail took me past a large area of dead-waters. I came upon a grungy group of trail maintainers. The young group were part of the Student Conservation Corps. They came from New Hampshire, Montana, and as far away as Alaska. At the direction of the MATC, the group had been laying stepping stones through some of the muddier sections to the north of where we stood. What a productive way for this great group of young adults to spend a summer. I got their picture, thanked them and moved on. It wasn’t long before I was stepping above the mud and water on some of their handy work. Job well done SCC!
Hiking just above the Rainbow Lake I found myself in an enchanted forest of large trees, moss-covered rocks and ferns. Huge boulders covered with moss had ferns growing on top. The loons were very active in the lake below. Their hooting and yodeling continued well into late morning.
The trail eventually dropped down close to the lake and I found a spot on a boulder protruding over the water to stop for a snack. I was able to get just enough signal there to get a call out to WW. When she answered the phone I could hear distress in her voice. She was already at the departure airport and said that she had just hurt her back while removing her daypack. She was so upset because she had been feeling great for weeks. I tried to calm her down a little because she was getting ready to get on the plane and she needed to try to let the muscles in her back relax. I ran my option to meet in Millenocket by her and she liked that idea.
After I got off the phone with WW my demeanor totally changed. All I wanted was to be there with her to help out as best I could. I also felt our fairly tale ending slipping away. In that moment I couldn’t see myself hiking through Baxter and up Katahdin without WW at my side. I definitely was in no mood to finish the final 9 miles of today’s hike. Every wet rock and root was suddenly an annoyance to me again. The mental aspect of a long distance hike is such an important component. When something outside of the hike (family issues, etc) slip into my psyche the mental drain has a real impact on my ability to physically continue hiking. I just wanted to be out of the woods and on my way to Boston to meet WW. But, my energy and enthusiasm was at an all time low. I stopped on Rainbow Ledges to eat some lunch and make some calls to set up lodging. By then WW had landed in Newark and she wasn’t doing well. She was in tears now and it was tearing me apart. She was already on board for the flight to Boston and not feeling well at all. I asked her to hit the call button and ask the flight attendant to see if she could get a bag of ice. She did. 
Lunch didn’t help with my energy level and I continued to walk in a funk for the rest of the hike. To make matters worse, there was bad weather in Boston and she sat on the tarmac for 2.5 hours. I had a decent signal now and we were able to text back and forth. We changed the topic to something more humorous to take the edge off. It seemed to help both of us. 
After exiting the 100-Mile Wilderness the trail followed a gravel road for a short distance. I crossed the Penobscot River on Abol Bridge. From the bridge there was an amazing view of Katahdin. I took a picture and moved on.  A short distance after the bridge, there was a campground with a camp store and restaurant. Rafting and other outdoor activities are popular in Baxter State Park and there were quite a few patrons in the restaurant. I mentioned to another hiker that I needed to find a ride into Millenocket. A young lady who had been rafting overhead me and said she would give me a ride. She hadn’t eaten dinner yet and I offered to get her burger. She agreed that it was a good deal. After dinner the young lady gave me a ride to Millenocket. As it turns out, that is a long haul with several miles along a gravel road. I offered my trail angel some money for gas and she just said to pay it forward.
About the time I was checking in, WW was arriving in Boston. She said the ice took the edge off and she was feeling up to driving all the way to Millenocket. I spent the next several hours talking to her in between hiker chores. At 0130 I met her in the parking lot. It felt so good to hold her in my arms. 
We will wait for tomorrow to see what tomorrow brings. For now, it is at it should be—TOGETHER AGAIN!
Peace & Blessings - NS

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600819,"The So thankful to be back with my Next Step! He was waiting by the road when I pulled into the parking lot of the motel. He was flashing his red light on his head lamp at me. I sure have missed my crazy mountain man!! I couldn’t believe how lean he had gotten, just since I left the trail. Yowsa! I’ve already warned him that he will not be able to fill up for about the next three weeks! That was how I felt, and I only hiked half as far as he did!! 
Speaking of filling up, we got up around 7:30 this morning and headed to the Appalachian Trail Cafe for some yummy breakfast. The ceiling was full of thru-hikers’ signatures. If everything goes as planned, Next Step will add his name on Tuesday morning! There are no words to describe how proud I am of him. No. Words. 
We hung out at the restaurant for awhile so Next Step could finish yesterday’s journal entry. I tried to get him to write it last night while he was waiting for me to get there, but he was afraid he would fall asleep. I’m thankful that I got to talk to him and the kiddos on my late drive. It definitely helped me from getting too sleepy. My sleep schedule hasn’t changed much since I’ve been hanging out at my parent’s house. So driving until 1:30 am was waaayyy past my bedtime! 
My back and ribs were still a bit tender to the touch this morning, but the spasms had settled down, so we thought it would be a good idea for me to hike up to the base of Katahdin with Next Step today. Just to warm me up and see how my body handles it. We started right outside Baxter State Park at he Abol Bridge Campground. Before we started our hike, we drove over the Abol Bridge so that I could get my first look at Katahdin...OH. MY. Now THAT is a mountain!!! I was trying not too be too intimidated. I just kept reminding myself that lots of other people have hiked up it and survived. Lol
The hike was 9.5 miles of almost “hiker heaven” terrain. I guess it’s the calm before the storm!! It felt so good to be back in the woods! Of course I was pointing out every mushroom, and all the different mosses and trees. I forgot for a minute that Next Step has been capturing all of these every day on his hike. I couldn’t help but “talk” to the red squirrels that love to chatter any time someone comes near them on the trail. I was startled several times when they would dart across the trail, right at my feet! This was my first trip to Maine and I certainly wasn’t disappointed! I got a small taste of the roots that Next Step has been dealing with, but fortunately,they only lasted for about a mile. No thank you, I’d rather just have the nice pine straw covered path instead. We had to cross the Nesowadnehunk Stream a couple of times. I could certainly tell that I was out of practice. I had gotten pretty good at that before I had to get off the trail. But today, I was very hesitant and had lost a bit of my courage. But I made it, and my feet stayed dry, so that was a win! 
We stopped at the Big Niagara Falls for a snack break and to do our communion. There were a couple of guys fly fishing and a few other hikers taking in the beauty. It was just another amazing part of an awesome day! 
When we finally reached Katahdin Stream Campground, we stopped by the Ranger’s Station to register our summit tomorrow. Next Step sat on a nearby picnic to look at the map to try and figure out the best way to get back to our rental car. I saw a car dropping off a hiker and getting ready to head out, so I ran over and tapped on their window and asked if they could give us a ride back to a picnic area near the car. It would only leave us about a mile and a half from our car instead of having to walk 4 1/2 miles down the campground gravel road. Thank you for the ride! No sooner had we started down the trail when we came across some LARGE fresh moose tracks! At one point, we even caught a whiff of him, but never saw him. Of course, I let Next Step lead the way, just in case. We ran into the General Store for some yummy chocolate milk before heading back to Millinocket for some even yummier pizza. Next Step certainly hasn’t forgotten the little things that make me very happy. 
I survived the hike and I’m just hoping that after another night of ice, stretching, Ibuprofen and lots of prayers, that our fairy tale ending will take Next Step to the summit, with his bride at his side!!! 
Hugs

",Katahdin Stream Campground ,"Aug 19, Sun",9.90
Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600981,"Mount Katahdin was so named by the Penobscot Indians. ""The Greatest Mountain"" is the highest in Maine at 5,267 feet and is the centerpiece of Baxter State Park. It is a steep, tall mountain formed from a granite intrusion weathered to the surface. Katahdin’s Baxter Peak is named after Governor Percival Baxter, who protected the surrounding area in the 1930s. Baxter Peak is the highest point on Mount Katahdin and the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. Katahdin has inspired hikes, climbs, journal narratives, paintings, and even a piano sonata. Monday, August 20th, 2018 was our time to become one with Katahdin.
Which Way and I started our trek from Katahdin Stream Campground at 0730. We checked in at the Ranger Station to register our hike before setting out. Ranger Nick then issued us a plastic permit to hike Katahdin. He wrote the number 451 on it, representing the number of NOBO hikers who have completed an AT hike at Mount Katahdin this year. There are several trails that lead up Mount Katahdin to Baxter Peak. We took the one marked with the White Blazes. The 5.2-mile long Hunt Trail is the longest path up the mountain in both length and time. The Park Authority has given the Hunt Trail the highest classification of  “10 - very strenuous”. However, the first mile and a half is not that steep and we passed over several mountain streams and by several waterfalls. It took awhile for the trail to become steep. Shortly after passing by the beautiful Katahdin Stream Falls the trail began to steepen. About a mile further we stopped at O Joy Brook to hydrate up and put the hiking poles away. They would be a hindrance from here as large boulders were now becoming abundant on the trail. This was our warmup exercise for what was coming. 
We reached treeline a little more than 2 miles from the summit. It was game on from there. The views were also out of this world from this point forward. Soon the trail surface was just boulders the size of cars and houses. These giant rocks were very difficult to traverse. Of course, I was having a blast. I’m sure Which Way was smiling on the inside, but she had her game face on for most of the ascent. We paused occasionally to take in the view, but continued steadily upward using our biceps and triceps as much as our leg muscles. (Just to pause here, because I’m sure some of you were wondering how WW was doing with her back. Just two days ago she never thought she would be able to make it up this mountain knowing the pain she was in. But God truly answered all the prayers that went up on her behalf - to Him be the Glory!). Metal bars were mounted to the rocks to assist hikers in some spots. During this section, we were starting to see several hikers who had had enough and were just perched on a boulder waiting for a friend or mate to return. We also passed Dirty Girl headed back down the mountain. The height and steepness were beyond her comfort level.  
A little over a mile from the top we pulled ourselves over a few final boulders at the steepest part of the Hunt Trail. The top of this section is referred to as the Gateway. From this point the trail transitions from incredible difficulty and somewhat technical climbing to a flatter and rocky walk along the tablelands. As we approached the Gateway a cloud began forming on the south slope of the mountain. The grey curtain ended generally on a line marked by the trail, ebbing and flowing with the wind. As we walked in and out of the cloud we were reminded one last time that the mountains make the weather. 
With the steepest ascent behind us, we pulled out our trekking poles for the final approach. Walking over the rocky terrain of tablelands was like being on a different planet. Yet, even in this rugged and weather worn landscape, alpine vegetation finds a way to exist and persist. Come to think about it, so do thru hikers. But it would all soon come to an end.
We were full of mixed emotions now as we trudged slowly upward of the final climb and saw that hikers congregating at the summit were now in sight. One more push up and then a turn to the right taking us up the ridge to our FINAL destination! I was feeling so relieved that Which Way was able to make the steep climb and that she was by my side as we drew within 200 yards of the target—the iconic sign marking the top of Katahdin. Which Way tried without success to FaceTime the kiddos as we completed the final minutes of the trek. So, I pulled out my phone and captured the final steps on a video. I summarized the hike as we drew closer to the sign.
A 2,190.9 mile, 178 day, journey through 14 states...passing 165,000 white blazes...with a total elevation change of nearly 1,000,000 feet...through rain, sleet, snow, wind, lightning, bitter cold, hot and humid weather...over, around and through rocks, roots, mud, and streams...hiking 8-12 hours a day...sleepless nights...insatiable appetites...enumerable challenges. I tried my best to respect the trail and embrace whatever it gave me. I quickly learned that it would provide what we needed and came to know that we would be rewarded along the way; rewarded with amazing vistas, wondrous plants and flowers, close-up encounters with wildlife, the company of a wonderful group of hikers, trail magic and the best of humankind. For six months we had the privilege of being immersed in God’s marvelous creation. We also experienced an amazing outpouring of generosity, kindness and love from family, friends and complete strangers. I cannot say enough about the trail community and the lasting impact it had on us. This certainly includes the kind words and encouragement we received from the readers of this journal. You uplifted and motivated us with your kind words and deeds. I am especially thankful that I was able to walk over 1,000 miles of this sacred trail with my beautiful Which Way. It provided three of the most blissful months in 30 fabulous years of marriage. Even when she could not physically continue by my side, I still considered it our journey. Was  it easy? No! Was it worth it? Absolutely! 
Now standing just a few feet from the marker, we waited our turn as some day hikers posed for pictures. At 1200 sharp, I handed my phone to a stranger who happily continued our video as we scaled the sign, put an arm around each other and hoisted our poles into the air with our free hands. It was officially finished. What a moment! What a journey!
Of course, it isn’t over until it’s over. We still had to get down this mountain. After a few minutes of celebration and phone calls we started the 5-mile descent. It was recommended that we hike down the north side of the mountain. The very steep Saddle Trail took us to Chimney Pond, where we picked up the Chimney Pond Trail to the Roaring Brook Campground. Just one last challenge, getting a ride 20 miles back to our car. Which Way yogied a ride from a Canadian couple who had just finished a day hike. They agreed to give us a ride about 10 miles to the park entrance. From there we would get another hitch to Katahdin Stream Campground. At the last second the couple said they would just give us a ride to our car. That was about 40 minutes out of their way. The trail continued to provide!
We stopped at the River’s Drive restaurant on the way back to Millenocket. It was a great spot to celebrate our accomplishment. The food was fantastic and the parties to our left and right joined in conversation about our hike. We sat on the patio with a wonderful view of Katahdin. After we ate, we walked to the water and watched the sun set on our dream. And yes, it was our Fairy Tale ending!
Peace and Blessings!

p.s. I will do another post or two later about our trip home (detour along Maine’s coast) and some post-hike thoughts.

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601712,"Wow! I am still trying to wrap my mind around the fact that Next Step finished his thru hike of the AT and that I was able to hike the last two days with him. And most importantly, that we were able to summit Katahdin together! We will have these memories forever - and the 1,000 miles we experienced together can never be taken away. 
Of course there was so much to talk about on our way back to Kentucky. We had thought about driving up to Mount Washington since I had missed out on that part of the hike, but since I am hoping to go back and complete the rest of the AT over the next several years, we decided to just wait and hike it together when the time came. Instead, we headed towards Boston via Acadia National Park and Bar Harbor. We had heard that both were “Must Do’s” and I needed some “active recovery” from our 9 hour climb and descent of Katahdin. It is amazing how quickly you lose your ability to climb up and down mountains without experiencing any soreness! It literally took me a full week to be able to walk up and down stairs without flinching from the pain in my calves and quads!! I NEVER had that once the whole 1,000 miles of my AT hike! Lol
Before heading to Acadia we went back to the Appalachian Cafe for breakfast so that Next Step could add his autograph to the 2018 Thru Hiker’s Ceiling Tile. We saw the names of several other hikers that we had met along the way. Great way to start the morning. Then we made the drive over to ANP. After stopping in at the Visitor  Center for a recommendation of places to see if you only have one day to spend in the park, we caught a park shuttle and stopped at several beautiful spots along the coastline. One being a “blow hole” on the beach where waves flow into a cavern at high tide and blow back out creating a sound of thunder and huge splashes up the walls of the outside of the cavern. Pretty cool! We didn’t get to see it at high tide, but it was still making some pretty decent splashes and loud booms! 
When we had had enough walking in the park, we decided to drive on down to the coast to Bar Harbor for an early seafood supper. Another great decision of the day, especially the shrimp cocktail. Yum! I had tried to book a room at a B&B the week prior, but most of the ones in our price range were already fully booked, and Bar Harbor was very busy and absolutely filled with tourists. We thought we might just try to find something a little bit farther from town and again, that was a great decision. Next Step just lucked upon The Homeport Inn in Searsport. He had called to see if there were any vacancies. We decided we would just drive by and look at it before we committed. Had no idea that we were about to hit a gold mine! Anita, one of the co-owners, greeted us warmly and gave us a mini tour of the B&B. We mentioned that we had just summited Katahdin and that Next Step had just finished his thru hike. She was immediately asking lots of questions, so he gave her the link to our trail journal. She and her son hike and she really wanted to hear all about our adventure. Of course, we LOVE trail talk so we chatted with her well over 30 minutes before we got checked into our room. She truly made us feel right at home. The next morning we had an extraordinary breakfast which included a Belgian waffle (just one item among MANY that Next Step chose for breakfast!!) with homemade maple syrup that was made by the family of the other co-owner, Marcia. Next Step liked it so much that he bought a pint to bring home with us! Oh, I forgot to mention that when we came down for breakfast, there was a To Go box containing two homemade blueberry muffins. On the box, Anita had written “a tasty treat for Next Step and Which Way’s travels.” She must have known that thru hikers need treats AT LEAST every two hours after they complete their hike. This would at least save us one stop!! Lol Anita and Marcia both came by to chat while we enjoyed our breakfast. Anita said she had stayed up reading through the first week of our trail journal. She was simply a joy to be around! We already have planned to stop back in and see her when I go back to complete my AT hike! I HIGHLY recommend The Homeport Inn if you’re ever in the area. You won’t be disappointed! Before we could leave, they asked to take our picture to put on their Facebook webpage. Of course!
We got on the road around noon and stopped in Augusta for a movie (shocker!) and then made our way to Hanscom AFB to spend the night. Had to go get some Mexican before we could turn in for the night! 
It was a wonderful way to spend our post hike recovery! But the best part was being with my Next Step! It’s going to be awhile before I let him out of my sight! No hurry trying to figure out our Next Step...

Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623878,"Well, it’s been a long time since we checked in with everyone. After finishing my thru hike, I figured we would take some time to reflect on our journey and figure out what we were going to do next before putting a final post out there. Plus, for someone who does not usually spend a lot of time writing, I had something akin to writer’s block, but worse. Capturing our journey for posterity’s sake and for others to take what they needed from it, turned out to be a worthwhile endeavor. However, it may have worn me out mentally as much as the hike did physically. Being completely transparent, it also felt a bit pretentious to think that anyone really cared about what was next for Which Way and Next Step. So, days turned to weeks, weeks turned to months, and before we knew it a year had passed since our Grand Adventure was finished.
A few casual followers, others who were pre-hike strangers but we now call friends, or those whose generosity is forever etched in our minds have prompted us to do a follow-on post. It reminded me of what I knew in my heart along, the vast majority of you who followed our journey really do care. You care about the AT and the hikers who attempt to complete it. You also care about the stories of challenges and real adversity that the AT throws at hikers and the reward and sense of pure joy that is experienced by those who persevere. You also care about the trail magic and blessings that overflow from the best of humanity and the Great I Am and how they intertwine with any AT journey. Many of you are the best of humanity that gave Which Way and me words of encouragement, lifts to town, shelter and so much more as we worked our way from Georgia to Maine.  So, writers block or not, here we go.

After the trail and a quick excursion down the beautiful coast of Maine, we caught a flight out of Boston to Kentucky, where we upgraded from a backpack and tent to the spare bedroom at Which Way’s parents. I spent the first couple of weeks simply recovering from the hike. For some reason, I thought I would immediately start to recover from the beating my feet and joints endured through the White Mountains and the rugged terrain in the wild of Maine. Instead, things got worse. It started with my feet. It only took a day or two wearing casual footwear before plantar fasciitis (falling arches) set in. The pain in my joints and stiffness in my back soon followed. I think wearing hiking shoes every day limited the foot pain to general soreness, that comes with hiking over rocks every day, and shooting pains during the night. When the shoes came off and the adrenaline of hiking every day subsided, all the physical fatigue to my joints and bones gave way to pain. The good news is that within 4-6 weeks my body healed. One thing I didn’t lose post-hike was my appetite. I came off the trail about 30 pounds lighter than when I started and Which Way and her mom took it as a mission to put some meat back on my bones. Mission accomplished, as I gained all the weight back (and then some) within two months of being off the trail. 
As you might imagine, Which Way and I don’t sit around much. So, it wasn’t long before we were on the move. We spent most of Fall 2018 traveling and visiting family in Georgia, Arkansas, Texas and Colorado. We spent a week or more in each state, coming back to Kentucky to recharge between visits. It was wonderful being able to spend extended time with family and friends. 
During one of our trips to Atlanta we made a side trip to meet Al and Susie, Trail Angels. Some of you may remember that they picked us up on the trail just outside of Franklin, NC and took us back to their place in Sky Valley, GA, where they pampered us for two days.  They also rescued us from the snowy Smokies and whisked us away to Gatlinburg to thaw out, fill our bellies with good food, and share in good times together. We stay in touch with Al and Susie and are planning to join up with them in the Spring to provide some trail magic.

We also did a considerable amount of walking and hiking in the Fall. In November we spent a weekend in Damascus with some new friends we met in Kentucky. They had closely followed our journey and were contemplating a long hike of their own. The husband, Alan, had just completed an amazing feat of his own. He is one of the few people on the planet who has run a marathon in every continent, including Antarctica.  As of today, he is only two states shy of running a marathon in each of the 50 states. He will complete that goal by Thanksgiving. The most amazing thing, is that he did not run his first marathon until he was in his sixties, just a few years ago. What an inspiration. While in Damascus we lodged at the Lazy Fox Inn with Miss Ginny. The Lazy Fox Inn was our favorite place that we lodged together on our AT hike and we were eager to have others experience Miss Ginny’s hospitality, great cooking and sweet spirit. I am so thankful that we returned there, as she sadly passed away in February. She was 93. Many an AT Hiker, Virginian Creeper Trail Biker and others who were blessed to be in the presence of Miss Ginny’s love for life and gift of serving others will carry fond memories of her in their hearts for years to come. Thank you, Miss Ginny!

As much as we love Which Way’s parents and enjoyed staying with them for a prolonged period of time, we realized that we needed to find a place of our own to settle. All of our stuff was still in storage in Northern Virginia and the clock was running out on the time that the U.S. Army allows retirees to find their post-career home. For me, that also meant finding a job. Although I still wasn’t exactly sure exactly what I wanted to do for a second career, I knew it to be work that mattered. In early November I started getting my resume’ together. A friend of ours in Tennessee knew we were in a time of transition and she shared a job announcement with me at Ramsey Solutions in Franklin, TN. I knew who Dave Ramsey was, but I did not realize that he led an 800+ team member company with multiple business units. After some more research, three books (authored by Dave), and hours of Dave Ramsey Show podcasts, I knew this job was a great fit. Ramsey Solutions mission statement says it all—“we provide common sense, biblically-based education and empowerment that give HOPE to everyone in every walk of life.” The job at Ramsey Solutions was the only one I applied for; 14 interviews and nearly three months later I was hired on as the Ramsey Solutions, Financial Peace Division Direct of Financial Operations. What a blessing to be contributing to such a great cause. We just moved into our brand new building (paid for with cash) and have broken ground on an a connecting building as we anticipate we will grow the team to 2,000 members in the coming years.

So, by the end of February we were in the Nashville area, where we had upgraded from a spare bedroom at the parents’ house to an efficiency apartment. Seeing a trend here? After a long search we then, purchased a home in Spring Hill, TN. Life is good! A year of transition and change continued as our youngest found her soulmate and they got married. Aspen, CO was the setting of a lovely wedding for a beautiful couple. And how awesome to see our oldest perform the marriage ceremony.

Oh, did I mention that Which Way still have the fever? That is, the AT fever. That’s right, she wants to finish the trail. Here’s the plan -  we will do section hikes each year, keeping her dream alive. I am so proud of her for sticking with it and am delighted to join her as we finish the journey together. Our first section hike will be from Bears Den Hostel in Bluemont, VA, where injury forced her off the trail and we will hike 80 miles to Caledonia State Park, PA. We start our hike next weekend (October 11th). We will be joined be by an old paratrooper friend of mine, Dale (Top Shelf). You may recall that Dale and his wife met us in Damascus during our hike. He has since caught the AT fever too. Last Fall he hiked from Damascus south to Mountain Harbor Hostel (75 miles). This Spring he started another section hike starting at Springer Mountain and hiking all the trail in Georgia. Lord willing, I think Top Shelf’s plan is to continue knocking out the southern half of the trail in the Spring of each year and joining us in the Fall for a section hike in the northern half. We will not be doing a daily post on our hike. However, we do plan to a single entry after each section hike summarizing our mini-adventure. I can’t wait to see how the second half feels again, but this time with my favorite hiker by my side.

Living the dream and keeping the dream alive!",,View Entry,"Oct 06, Sun",0
Which Way and Next Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624305,"Evidently Which Way’s 1,000 mile hike from Springer Mountain, GA to Northern Virginia was not enough to get the calling of the Appalachian Trail out of her system. Although she overcame tremendous adversity during our 2018 AT journey, she was eventually forced off the trail with a back injury. After some time to recover and reflect, Which Way could not ignore the insistent whisper of the trail calling her back. So, the Grand Adventure continues. It will do so in the form of section hikes spanning over the next several years—Lord willing and AT permitting.

Our first section hike started on Friday, October 11th, at Bears Den Hostel (vicinity Bluemont, VA). From Snickers Gap we wrapped up the Virginia Roller Coaster, hiking north along the Blue Ridge Mountains, passing through West Virginia and Maryland. After crossing the Mason-Dixon Line, the Blue Ridge gave way to South Mountain, eventually bringing us to Caledonia State Park, PA. The path meandered through the Harper’s Ferry Wilderness Area, four State Parks, a few regional parks and several Civil War historical sights.

For the data geeks out there, the average grade over the 80-mile hike was 6.5 percent, with over 26,000 feet in elevation change. Other than the short hike in to camp late in the afternoon on Day 1, we averaged 11 miles a day. Except for a few rocky stretches, the trail surface was conducive to a good hiking rhythm.

The weather was almost perfect, with highs ranging from the mid-50s to low-70s and lows in the 40s. We had one day of heavy rain (which we managed to avoid hiking in) followed by a day of gusting winds.

Before I turn it over to Which Way I want to say how proud I am of her for continuing this journey. I’ll steal her thunder a bit by saying she picked up right where she left off, minus the considerable pain and agony she endured in 2018. In a word, she ROCKED!!! As for me, I was hiking with overwhelming joy in my heart. First, I was able to share in her excitement as she reached new milestones. Second, I hiked with a vigor that I found nearly impossible to muster when I hiked this portion of the trail without my best friend at my side. Finally, experiencing the magic of the trail together is a rare and beautiful thing. Speaking of beautiful, over to the star of the trek to bring you the hike through her eyes.

Peace & Blessings - Next Step

Can someone please pinch me?…I MUST be dreaming!! I am back on the AT, one of my favorite places to be. We arrived at Bear’s Den Hostel (where I came off the thru hike in June 2018) and Top Shelf (aka Dale, one of Next Step’s paratrooper buddies from his days in the 82nd) was already tucked in his sleeping bag. The room he secured for us just happened to be the same room we stayed in last year. So cool! I had to chuckle at myself. I knew that this would be my last shower for a few days, so I took in all my hygiene/beauty products that I had brought for the end of our section hike – three bags worth!! My hygiene for the rest of the journey fit into a quart size baggie and of course, there are no beauty products – they weigh too much for sure! I definitely turn into a different person when I put on my backpack. Lol

I woke up Friday morning well before 5AM. I am sure it was partly from excitement and the rest was nervous energy. I’ve been doing a lot of walking since I left the AT, but I had no idea what to expect when I had to carry my backpack for an extended time. We did a shakedown hike a few weeks ago, but it was only for one night. Next Step had already decided that he would carry all of our food (except for our snacks) to try to keep my pack as light as possible.

We drove into town and found some delicious breakfast sandwiches (and a Coke Zero, of course!!) and started taking care of the logistics for our hike. We dropped Top Shelf’s truck at Caledonia State Park, dropped our CRV outside the Washington Monument State Park, and caught a shuttle back to Bear’s Den. On our way back to Bear’s Den we made a quick stop at the Bluemont General Store for some yummy chili for lunch and picked up some sandwiches to carry in for our supper. It was a short 3.5-mile hike to Raven Rocks where we spent our first night tenting on some cliffs with amazing views and a breathtaking sunset. What a start to the trip! The only downside to Raven Rocks was the attack of the stink bugs. They were EVERYWHERE!!! They covered our tent and us! Fortunately, as soon as the sun set and the temperatures dropped, they disappeared (except for the few that had taken refuge inside our tent).  It only took one night to get back into the habit of finding sleep before 8 pm. 
We decided to be ready to hike out at dawn, so we were up and at it around 6AM and on the trail as soon as we could see the path. This turned out to be a great plan because the wildlife were still hanging around as we passed through their homes. (And the other reward, was that it would get us into camp every day, except one, before 3 pm which I absolutely loved!). We saw several deer within just a few minutes of entering the woods, not to mention tons of squirrels and chipmunks throughout the day. We expected to see some day hikers since it was a holiday weekend, but we were surprised to run into well over a dozen SOBO’s. Next Step had told me that this section was some of the nicest terrain along the trail, and boy was he right! The 11 miles we hiked on Saturday had just a few stretches of rocks to maneuver over or around. No complaints here!

We stopped in a shelter for lunch which had a separate pavilion with a picnic table and even had a porch swing! Next Step had also told me that we would pass by some of the nicest shelters along the AT and obviously, he wasn’t kidding – WOW! We made it to our stop for the day to a parking lot about 10 minutes from Stoney Brook Hostel, where we had arranged to stay for the night. They sent Ish, a super friendly fellow, to pick us up and he arrived within just a few minutes. Ish dropped us at our cabins where we found a basket of goodies and towels for our “luke-cool” shower (as Next Step called it) and an invitation to supper and their nightly devotional. Next Step and I accepted both and were treated like special guests. While most might not fully agree with their religious ideology, they definitely practice what they preach in trying to make the world a better place by showing love to all who cross their path. However, they had about 15 goats that had other plans. Apparently, there was a break in the goat pen and the whole herd was traveling from bush to bush, eating everything in sight with no regard for anyone! It was very entertaining to watch, to say the least. But those goats came in very handy. For supper they served us the most delicious tomato soup I’ve ever eaten with homemade parmesan cheese made from the goat’s milk along with piping hot homemade jalapeno cheese bread with sun-dried tomatoes. You can just never anticipate the experiences you will get on the AT. Once again, we were in bed by 7 with a 6:30AM shuttle arranged for Sunday morning.

Ish was right on time and had us back to the trail before sunrise. We did our stretching and took off down the trail as soon as it was light enough to safely start hiking. One again we were rewarded for our early start with seeing 10 deer within the hour. I was super excited because today we were hiking into Harper’s Ferry. When I was here last year, I was calling for a rental car to get to a physical therapist to try and “fix” my back. But this time, I have never felt better!! In fact, so far, I haven’t even had a hot spot on my feet! I’m sure most of you remember that I started with a blister within the first hour of our thru hike last year and dealt with them the entire 3 months of my journey. I am completely euphoric with how AMAZING I feel so far on this trip! SO THANKFUL!

We made it to the ATC by 10 am, picked up a few souvenirs, and then hiked down to the local outfitter to get Top Shelf a new set of hiking poles. We HAD to go to Sweet Alisha’s Pizza for lunch! I mean, it would be wrong not to. Right?! The owners were running the restaurant and were very hiker friendly. Not to mention, they have the cutest little 5 year old “waiter” I’ve ever seen! Top Shelf finished before we did and headed out and we soon followed. We hiked across the railroad bridge and knew that we would then have some of the three easiest miles on the AT – 3 miles on the C&O Canal. My plan had been to just take it easy and enjoy the flat, plush terrain while it lasted, but I guess that just wasn’t meant to be. A couple of day hikers had joined us as we crossed the bridge. The one walking with me was planning a thru hike next year. When he found out that Next Step had completed a thru hike last year and that I had made it 1,000 miles, he was full of questions. Anyone who knows me, knows that the more excited I get, the faster I not only talk, but also the faster I walk. Well, talking about the AT must really get me going, because we were almost running for those 3 miles!! Next Step and the guy’s buddy were just trying to keep up. At the end of the canal, we gave him our email info in case he had any more questions and wished them well. Next Step and I then hiked the three remaining miles to our shelter. We stopped along the way for our communion and it brought back so many warm memories of all of our Sundays together last year on our journey! 
It was a ½ mile hike down to get to the water, so I graciously agreed to hold down the fort while Next Step and Top Shelf made the trek down. After supper, Top Shelf turned in really early, so Next Step and I got out our newly purchased ATC playing cards to pass the time until bedtime. That was our longest hiking day so far, so sleep came easily.

On Monday morning, once again, we started hiking at daylight, but this time, we only jumped one deer Next Step and Top Shelf better hang on, because today is TOWN DAY!!! We are hiking to our CRV and then going into Hagerstown for REAL FOOD and a motel! Even on a week-long section hike, I still LOVE town day! We got to the car around 2 pm and had already eaten lunch. But when we stopped at Chickfila for my Coke Zero, we all agreed that some French fries would be the perfect snack to hold us until supper. We got checked in, got our showers, did laundry, and got our dishes washed. Then we all headed to the Outback – YUMMO!!! I saw a Bruster’s Ice Creamery nearby, but I guess we haven’t been hiking long enough to be that hungry yet. However, I already asked that we stop there on our way back to Tennessee after the hike. We got back to the room and got all packed up, set the alarm for 5:45 and called it a day.

We met in the lobby for breakfast at 6 am on Tuesday morning and then drove to meet our sweet shuttle driver, Nina. She picked us up at Penmar Park and dropped us back at Mount Washington State Park. Unfortunately, when we got all of our stuff out of her car, I realized I had only made it there with one of my hiking poles - Oops! Oh well, I honestly only use them on steep ascents and descents. Last year, my physical therapist indicated that overusing my poles had added to my back issues. I definitely don’t want to do that again, so no worries. Today was chipmunk day on the trail. Those cute little critters were scampering about every few feet. I can’t help but smile every time I see them scurrying around. Next Step and Top Shelf had not yet caught up to me when I came across a group of trail maintainers and a ridge runner who must have been having a bad day (based on her unusually grumpy disposition). So when she asked where I was headed, I just couldn’t help myself and answered, “Some shelter up the trail. You’ll have to ask the guys behind me.” She exclaimed, “You’re the leader and you don’t even know where you’re going?!?!” I answered, very seriously, “Oh, I’m sure I’ll recognize it when I see the name of it.” I just wish I had taken a picture of the look on her face! 
We had heard that there was no water at the shelter where we staying for the night, so we decided to stop at Pogo Camp for lunch (which did have a nice spring nearby). We also thought it would be a good idea to cook our hot supper meal for lunch and save our PB&J wraps for supper so that we wouldn’t have to use much water once we got to camp. But that ended up not being an issue anyway (more about that later). I took off as soon as we finished lunch and after a bit of hiking Next Step came up and told me he had some VERY EXCTING news. He had been looking at his Guthook app and had read about hikers getting rides into a nearby town from the shelter we were staying at for the night. Except he had an even BETTER idea – what if we could find someone to deliver food to us?!?!? So he called Vince’s Pizza and wouldn’t you know it, “Sure, we deliver to the parking lot just .3 miles from the shelter.” Hello!!!! Sign. Me. Up. Just one more reason I love that man! He certainly knows just how to make deposits in my Love Bank! I was practically skipping the rest of the hike to the shelter. 
When we arrived, we dropped our packs at a tent site before walking down to the shelter, where we met Slug Sloth and Army of Mice (aka Keith and Lynda) a super nice couple from DC that were section hiking as well. We told them our plan to order pizza for supper and asked if they wanted to do the same. They had VERY puzzled looks on their faces and then Lynda asked, “Did you guys hike all the way out here just to order pizza to eat at the shelter?” At first, we didn’t understand their confusion and then we realized we had dropped our packs before they saw us, so they thought we had literally just shown up with nothing and were just there to eat pizza at a shelter!! Too funny! We explained that were section hiking and had dropped our packs back at the tent site and then they agreed that ordering pizza was a GRAND idea, especially since they had miscalculated the number of meals they needed and were short by one. Around 4:30 we called Vince’s back and then around 5:00, the four of us set out the .3 mile trek to the parking lot to get our supper. The delivery lady was already there and looked very happy to see us emerge from the woods. She thought she had missed us. We took a few pictures and headed back to the shelter to enjoy our delicious pizza. Afterwards, we learned that Slug Sloth LOVES to build campfires, so we all sat around chatting and enjoying the warm fire. Next Step had checked the AT Weather App and saw that there was ½ - ¾ inches of rain in the forecast for the next day and it was to start around 10 am. So we all decided to get an early start and try to get the five mile hike to the next shelter done before the rain set in. 
I woke up around 4:30 and never went back to sleep. We were back on the trail with our head lamps on a bit before daylight after getting a quick cup of coffee/tea and our oatmeal/grits breakfast. Next Step and I only stopped when nature called and for a couple of photo ops on some really cool rock formations. We ended up arriving at the shelter by 9 am. The only thing that makes me hike faster than Town Day, is an approaching storm, so we were certainly hauling! The rain was supposed to last all day, so as section hikers, we got to take advantage of a luxury we NEVER had a thru hikers – wait out the storm INSIDE THE SHELTER!!! We claimed our spots in the lower level of the shelter and soon after, Top Shelf, Slug Sloth and Army of Mice showed up and did the same. The shelter was quite new and was absolutely beautiful! It had hardwood floors that I would be happy to have in my house! There was a nice overhang with a picnic table and a fire ring with 3 super nice benches. The rain held off until about 11, but didn’t stop until around 5 pm. The wind was whipping, so even though the temperatures were in the low 50’s, it felt much cooler than that. So we spent most of the day sitting with our backs against the shelter wall and our legs tucked nicely under our warm quilts. I even got a nap in – another luxury we rarely got to do last year on our thru hike. As the day wore on and the rain continued to pour, more and more hikers, mostly SOBO’s, made their way to the shelter to get out of the storm. By the time the rain stopped, the shelter was full and there were several tents set up as well.

Oh, I almost forgot the funniest moment of the day! When Next Step and I first arrived at the shelter this morning, he decided to make a run for the water before the rain arrived, since we got there so early. The spring was .5 miles from the shelter, so it was a bit of a haul to get there and back. I started unloading our packs, since we had pretty much decided to just call it a day. After I got my pack unloaded and was working on Next Step’s, I was very perplexed because I didn’t see his food bag in his pack. (Don’t forget, he had agreed to carry ALL OF OUR FOOD!!!) Well, when Slug Sloth and Army of Mice showed up, Slug Sloth asked, “Did you guys maybe leave something at the last shelter this morning???” THANK YOU!!!!! They had found our food bag sitting on a rock wall where Next Step had loaded his pack. Since it was still dark when we left, it blended right in with the wall and he didn’t realize it didn’t make it in the pack. Of course, he won’t live that one down for a while! Slug Sloth thought that maybe we were testing him to see if he would bring it or not. Um, no, it definitely was an accident! 
Once again, after supper, Slug Sloth built another fire and most of the hikers huddled around warming themselves before turning in for the night. Fortunately, I had packed ear plugs, so no worries on a full shelter. I will be sleeping like a baby! 
We were up and at it and ready to go by daylight. Our vehicle was only 5 miles away at Pen Mar Park, so our original plan had been to hike to the car, go into town and do laundry, resupply, grab lunch and then return the car to the park and hike another 5 miles to Deer Lick Shelter. However, the SOBO’s had recommended that we hike an additional 3.5 miles past Deer Lick Shelter, on to Tumbling Run Shelter which had a much better water source and had MUCH nicer facilities. That would make for a 13.5 mile day. That would have been a “normal” hiking day on last year’s hike, but that was pushing it for our section hike since we weren’t used to several back-to-back hiking days. So Next Step suggested that he drop off Top Shelf and me and we could slackpack 8 of the 8.5 additional miles and he would run by Subway and get sandwiches to carry in for our supper, go park the car near Tumbling Run Shelter and hike south until he meet us. He first wanted to walk in with us until we crossed the Mason-Dixon Line when we reached the Pennsylvania border so get some pictures and then send us on our way. We thought that sounded like a MUCH better plan, so once we got the photos, he headed back to the CRV and Top Shelf and I set off. With my much lighter pack, I reached the first shelter, Deer Lick in no time. I decided to stop and have a Snickers Bar to help get me the rest of the way to the next shelter. I took out my phone to text Next Step and let him know where I was at. However, as soon as I hit “Send”, my phone rang and it was him letting me know that Top Shelf had twisted his knee and that he had gone back to Pen Mar to pick him up. He still had to make the stop at Subway, so it would be a bit before he could get the CRV and walk in to meet me. I could tell he was a bit anxious knowing that I was out there by myself. (I mean, my name is Which Way for a reason, and I had already made 5 road crossings!!!). Now he would kind of know how I felt when he was hiking by himself! But I was fine and was hiking at my best, especially since my load was so light. After just a couple of more miles, I looked up and there was Next Step heading down the trail for me. It was so great to see him! We hiked on up to the CRV, reloaded my pack and hiked the .5 miles to the shelter. And oh my, they weren’t kidding about the Tumbling Run Shelter being nice!! Not only did it have two different shelters (one labeled “Snorers” and the other labeled “Non-Snorers”), but it had two huge clotheslines, two picnic tables (one under a pavilion with a vase of roses on it!!!!) with metal pads on each end of the tables for cooking. Did we accidentally hike to the Hilton?!?! Slug Sloth and Army of Mice were already there and had set up in the Snorers shelter. I’m sure Next Step was hoping to not have to set up the tent and have us sleep in the shelter, but he knows that is not my favorite, so we set up camp and then headed back over to the shelter to enjoy our Subway sandwiches, and cookies, of course. Top Shelf decided that his section hike was over due to his injury and the plan was for him to hike down the .5 miles to our CRV in the morning and drive it to Caledonia State Park, where his truck was parked. Then he would go ahead and head back home to North Carolina. We are so sorry that he got hurt, but so thankful for the time we shard on our hike. I forgot to mention that he should be doing Stand Up for extra money in his retirement. He kept us laughing with his endless jokes! The only  thing funnier was Next Step trying to retell the jokes and me “correcting” him the whole time for leaving out half the details. I’m pretty sure we could do our own Couples Stand Up routine! Lol

The caretakers of the Tumbling Run Shelter hiked in while we were there with their sweet dog, Mocha. They have been maintaining it since 1991 and they said when they started, there were only the 2 shelters, one picnic table and a mud pit. Great job guys! You have gone ABOVE and BEYOND!!! We hung out with Slug Sloth and Army of Mice around another nice campfire until around 8 and then turned in for the night so we could listen to our Astros game until we fell asleep.

Our last morning we slept in until about 6:45 since we knew we were just hiking out the last 10 miles of this trip to our CRV at Caledonia State Park ( a day ahead of schedule, btw). While I was getting breakfast ready, Next Step carried our tent, sleeping bags, sleep pads and clothes bags back to the car to lighten our loads. We said our goodbyes to Top Shelf, Slug Sloth and Army of Mice and headed out around 8:15 and we still made it to our CRV before 12:30, but I was WORN OUT!! I was very thankful that we had dumped most of the weight out of our packs, for sure. Today was the only day we didn’t see any deer on our hike. I guess all those early morning starts were worth it. 
Once we finished hiking we drove around the corner to a local restaurant (the same one we ate at last year when I picked up Next Step) and feasted on some delicious chili cheese hot dogs with French fries. Then we started towards home. Don’t worry, we still stopped in Hagerstown for some Bruster’s ice cream! And what a difference those few more days of hiking made because I had absolutely no trouble finishing off my double-scooped waffle cone! Unfortunately, both of us were struggling to stay awake and the traffic was pretty heavy when we reached I-81, so we decided to stop in Harrisonburg, VA for the night so we could get our showers and supper before the baseball game.

What an INCREDIBLE week it has been!! I am so thankful that my Next Step was more than happy to help me continue our Grand Adventure and I just feel blessed beyond measure! Now, we will just look forward to our return for another week next year.
