Toes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/276839,Well here is post number one. I'm sort of a gear list junkie. I list the gear then check it and list it again. Then I get a new piece and I have to start all over.This list will probably be redefined again and again but I thought I would get it up here so readers can get a sense of my packing style.,,Gear List Update,"Jun 08, Mon",0
Toes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/276879,"Well I've said a little in the ""about me"" section but I'll add some more here.It's 2009 and I'm turning 48 this month. I've spent 27 years working as an accounting clerk or manager. I guess I've been fairly bored with it for about 15 years, not good. I've always been the solid, dependable type, with the idea that I have to provide for my family by being the stable money earner. My wife Jennifer is totally opposite to me, she takes the risks, moves to different jobs and has basically made herself more marketable for better postions.I have 4 children, Sarah 27 this year and Josh, 22 in November, both from my first marriage. Madison is 12 and Lucas is 10, from my 2nd marriage. I am proud of all my children. They all love to do outdoor things with me.I guess there are a few reasons why I want to hike the AT. First of all, I think I have gotten the fever from reading so many other people's journals. Secondly, I'm at the point in my life where I just want to hit the trail and walk.Will I make it from Georgia to Maine? I don't know for sure. I know I have to hike my own hike and go at my own pace. I don't think the physical will be a problem. Although I am overweight right now, I have done a lot of outdoor adventures every year for as long as I remember. For me I think the psychological aspect may be the hardest to overcome. I know I have my wife's support so that is great and could help me bigtime.",,More about me.,"Jun 09, Tue",0
Toes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/277057,"Well here it is and I will see if it works. A lot of people add a 3rd entry just to get there journals up and running. I guess that is sort of what I'm doing here.A little more about me, since it's my journal. I've been involved in different aspects of outdoor pursuits. I started canoe tripping at the age of 13 and have done an average of one good trip (4 nights plus) every year.I've done mostly day hikes over the years but never an extended one. I'm hoping that before I get to the AT I will get a shot at the Bruce Trail here in Ontario. It's an 800 kilometre trail from Niagara to Tobermory that traverses the Niagara Escarpment. No it probably isn't nearly as difficult as the AT but logistically it could prove a challenge. Where the AT is close in proximaty to a lot of trail towns the Bruce Trail is not. That will make it difficult for resupply.Anyway I have most of my gear list up. A lot of the weights and costs are estimates but please feel free to critique where you wish but remember it is my perogative to ignore or take people's advice.",,Third Entry,"Jun 10, Wed",0
Toes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/298520,"Well it's been a long time since my last entry. A lot has happened, my family has been moved up to Sudbury, my wife and I have separated and reconciled and my last day of work in Waterloo is this Friday. On Saturday I will move up here to Sudbury full-time to be with my family.I still have a desire to hike the AT, I'm not sure if it will be in 2016 or 2017. I guess it depends on the timing of my youngest son's post secondary schooling.I am planning a short solo hike in May of this year in Killarney park Ontario so today I have jerky drying in the hydrator and I plan on doing ground beef and spaghetti sauce soon. 
I did a neat little day hike with my oldest daughter Sarah as shown in the photo. We drove up to High Falls and started out on a 2km trail but picked up a side trail that turned into and intermediate trail of another 3km or so.",,Winter 2010,"Feb 21, Sun",0
Toes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/334921,"I attempted a hike early in May, trying to complete the Lacloche Silohette Trail in Killarney park. I had to bail but completed over 50 kilometres. I hiked with a younger, fitter partner and instead of hiking my own hike I tried to keep up with him and kept a pace that was much faster than my body could handle. Consequently I developed chaffing, blisters and 4 bruised toes which resulted in the loss of those 4 toenails.I have attached a photo of my hiking partner Doug. I dubbed him the hiking machine because he set a pace and then just burned up the trail.After reading AWOL 2003's book ""AWOL on the Appalacian Trail"", I have a renewed motivation to hike the AT, however, I know now that I must hike it solo, at my own pace. I also know that the psychological aspect of the hike is going to be the hardest part for me.
I've been walking more frequently and trying to get into better shape. I had let my weight get up there, gaining 27 pounds since moving here but I am now back down under 200 with a goal of losing 20 to 25 more pounds to help in the conditioning regimine.
The family is now looking at relocating back to southern Ontario and we are in the process of looking for new jobs.","

Toes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/335430,"Well it's been a crazy week. Been emailing fellow journal writers and all that.I went for a 2nd interview this week for a company in Waterloo Ontario for the position of Controller. They offered me the job and the next day I phoned them back to accept the position. I've been off work for almost 11 months now so it's exciting to go back. However, the job is in southern Ontario and my family is going to be in northern Ontario until the house sells and we pick one up in the south, my wife also needs to find a job in the south.I don't think this will put a damper on my plans for an AT thru in 2016 but nothing is ever certain in life. I will be updating this journal from time to time and I will try to be a little more conscientious in the future.Toes.(because they will hurt most)","Long awaited update

Toes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/471985,"So, it's been a long, long time since my last journal entry. Many things have taken place in my life. Where to start? Well I am working in Walkerton Ontario. I took a job in March 2011 as CFO for a furniture company, many ups and downs in this industry. Stupid Liberal government is making Ontario a hostile place for manufacturers.My wife Jennifer left me early in 2012 and she actually got remarried in March of 2014. Not alltogether a bad thing as there were many problems in our marriage. My youngest daughter Madison(now 17) lives with me full-time and I have shared custody of my son Lucas(now 15). I have been dating a wonderful woman named Mary-Louise now for about 2 years and we enjoy many outdoor adventures together. You can see her on my motorcycle behind me in the photo.I haven't been hiking much but still have my sights set on the AT, although I have been rethinking my starting date and will likely have to delay it until 2018. This would give Lucas time to get started on his first year in Post-Secondary education.Hope to write sooner next time.","
