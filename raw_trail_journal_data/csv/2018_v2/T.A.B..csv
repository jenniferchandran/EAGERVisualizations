T.A.B.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583947,"Hiked the approach trail to Black Gap yesterday (day 0).  Shelter was full, so set up camp in the rain.  Daylight saving messed me up a little this morning and it took way too long to break camp in the rain, so started out near lunch time.  Made it to Springer and then refilled water at Springer shelter.  Hadn't eaten lunch and decided I was done for the day.Pretty sure I am the slowest person on the trail.  I've met lots off people as they pass me.  Figure it'll take a while for someone to know me well enough to give me a trail name.  Left up to me, T.A.B. would be an obvious choice (take a break).  Two Step might work (plant hiking poles, take two steps, repeat).Registered in as hiker 854.  Figure I can treat it like a DNR tag: ""Dang, that ol' 854 really made miles today.""  That would be preferable to """"Damn shame that 854. At least he went down fighting.""Being slow is ok with me as I know my trail legs will come with time.","Black Gap

T.A.B.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584011,"Made it to Hawk Mountain shelter. Now have two trail names, but will need to decide.  ""Slow Train"" and ""Spice Man.""Expecting temps near 30 tonight with wind gusts near 40mph.","Springer Mountain Shelter

T.A.B.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584078,"Yesterday's entry was brief because I was preoccupied with staying warm.  First night out I noticed my Therm-A-Rest Neo Air XTerm is too big for my Hummingbird Single Hammock.  Partially inflating the XTherm made it useable, but prone to sliding off the edge of the hammock.  As such, I didn't feel safe trying to get into my Thermolite liner.  Low temps and near 40 mph wind gusts last night made me realize this gear issue was also a problem.  Sustainded winds weren't too bad, but every gust was enough to make any body part not protected by the XTherm get cold enough to wake me up.  Between that and being woken by the XTherm sliding out of the hammock I got very little sleep, or rest.  With low 20's forecasted tonight it didn't feel safe to stay on the trail.  So, a shuttle ride back to Cooper's Gap tomorrow morning and my goal will be Woody Gap.  The Official AT guide specifies camping at Woody Gap, but AWOL' s guide doesn't and neither does the AT Trail app I downloaded.  At Least Suches has a couple shuttles based there.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

T.A.B.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584176,"Made it the 11.7 miles to the Lance Creek camping area.  Just felt like there was a lot more downhill than up today.   Designated for 6 campsites, there's over a dozen here now.  The Jarrard Gap shelter is 3 miles North, with an easy 4+ miles into Neels Gap. Both the shelter and campsite are packed with a flood of people ready to descend on the outfitter and hostel.
Did have a conversation with a few other hikers concerning my multiple trail names.  While all are good, T.A.B. (take a break) was considered the best, so Tab it is.
Have decided I definitely need a bigger hammock.  This Hummingbird single is just too small. Am using one of my quilt's elastic straps to keep the sleeping pad in the hammock by my feet.  Will get into the 20's tonight, but wind is very light.  Should be good","Coopers gap

T.A.B.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584268,"Today was a ""zero day,"" a day with no A.T. miles hiked.  Zero days are used to resupply & pig out on real food.  I collected my ""bounce box"" (a box with various items a hiker sends to themselves further up the trail) and swapped out my too small hammock for the larger one.  Even with the extra weight that comes with a larger hammock, some other gear changes I made probably shaved around 3lbs off my pack weight.
Unfortunately, I did tweak my knee descending Blood Mountain yesterday.  What started out as an epic controlled slide turned into a wipeout when a hiking pole snagged, turning into an anchor, and violently twisted me to the ground.  Stared doing my assessment, arms & shoulders ok despite being yanked backwards, then the knee let itself be known.  Found out that going down stairs backwards didn't hurt and that walking backwards, in general, was pain free.  The knee did settle down, but noticed an occasional twinge while walking around town today, so picked up a knee brace just in case.  ""Loosen the brace if your leg starts to swell""..... Does the world really have to slow down for people who need that instruction?
Will be dropped off at Neel's gap tomorrow morning and will generally hike to each shelter (6-8ish miles apart).  The first shelter is 1.2 miles off the trail steeply downhill.  Yeah... Going to be camping closer to the trail tomorrow night.  Should be at the Top of Georgia hostel next Thursday.
Talking with some of the shuttle drivers, it is apparently common for hikers to lose their appetite early on.  I am one of those people.  When I started out, my food bag had food for 6 days.  I still had over half after 5 days on the trail.  But, hey, I can tighten my belt another notch!","

T.A.B.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584398,"no phone signal last night:Heel Gap to just past Hogpen Gap, about 7 miles.  Could have gone father, but the next tent spot, or shelter is 4 miles away and I was good to stop.
With my schedule to be at the Top of Georgia hostel on Thursday, tomorrow I will only hike to the next shelter.  The next 3 shelters after that are 7-8 miles apart, setting me up for a 4 mile hike to the Hostel.  They run shuttles into town, so will be able to resupply as well.
Did experience Trail Angels and Trail Magic today.  Trail Angels are people who do nice things for hikers and Trail Magic is the nice thing.  ie:  A group of 2016 thru hikers set up a canopy, chairs, and invited hikers to enjoy some hotdogs, chips and cold soda.  This was a mile away from my destination, so ended up not needing to make dinner.
There's a group of 4 people I seem to be keeping pace with:  Nerp (nurse that likes purple), Sunshine (don't know her story), Wet Stick (able to start fires with wet sticks), and Galaxy Hiker (has been hitching for a couple years and decided to keep that nickname for the AT).  Good group, just taking their time and having fun.","Neels Gap
