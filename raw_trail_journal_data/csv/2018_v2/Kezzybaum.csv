Kezzybaum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541401,"Today I start to add journal entries to Trail Journals website. I have been reading hundreds of exciting journals of thru-hikers from the Appalachian Trail over the past years and I am a true fan of this website. In 2018 I will be thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail. So in preparation, I plan on hiking 1000 miles in 2016 and another 1000 miles in 2017. In2016 I have hiked/trained 750 miles. We are avid campers and spend most of the spring, summer and fall out camping. We are tent campers, I just can not see myself crammed into a crowded RV camping area. I like my space lol. Whenever we camp lately I try to spend extra time out hiking and putting in miles. So this week my nephew Paul and I strapped on our fully loaded backpacks and went out for a test run on the Prairie Lake Mountain Bike Trail in Jim Edgars Panther Creek State Park. We are from Illinois and almost all the terrain is flat around here. (not the best place to get in shape to climb all of those mountains on the AT). Paul and I are going to start doing hikes around Illinois, Missouri, Indiana and Iowa. They will mostly be short 2-3 day hikes although we do have a 14 day 160 mile hike planned in October on the River To River Trail in the Shawnee National Forest in southern Illinois. We will walk from one side of Illinois to the other. I will post journals from our adventures on the Trail Journals website and hopefully have some fun and entertaining reading for all of you. This is my first attempt at posting an online journal, so tighten up your boot laces and lets put one foot in front of the other and lets mosey down the trail together.",,Prairie Lake Campground,"Jul 02, Sat",0
Kezzybaum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541417,"So the plan was made and its official. Tuesday 07/05/2016 we are headed to Jim Edgars Panther Creek SP with fully loaded backpacks to make a test run and see what gear works and what doesn't. I work 13 hour midnight shifts and I will be at work Monday night from 6PM to 7AM Tuesday morning (the day we are leaving...with no sleep, yikes) We planned for Paul to pick me up at 8AM. It will be a long day (awake for over 30 hours) but I'm stoked. Bring it on.",,Jim Edgars Panther Creek SP,"Jul 03, Sun",0

Kezzybaum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541421,"And here we go. I got off of work this morning at 0715 and Paul met me at the house at 0735. Man, was I ready to get our little adventure started. We went to the bank, then went to the grocery store for our trail food. It was too early to stop for lunch but we should have at least stopped for breakfast somewhere. That was mistake #1. Before we knew it we were at Jim Edgars Panther Creek State Park. We checked in with the campground host and off we went to the primitive campground. Being a Tuesday morning I did not expect to see three cars in the primitive camping parking lot. People were loading up gear into their cars as they were finishing their camping trip. We talked and visited with them for a little while until they all left. We unloaded our gear not fully sure of the game plan. We were just going to wing it. I threw 4 bottles of water in my pack and Paul didn't take any because he had his platypus water system. The skies were sunny and a bright blue. We hiked back to the furthest shelter #7 in the primitive campground. There we spread our gear on the picnic table, it looked like a backpack explosion. We opened boxes and packages of new items, threw away the trash in our own garbage can that came with our camp site. The sites are very nice with a 3 sided shelter, fire ring, picnic table and a garbage can for only six dollars a night. Too bad we didn't get to sleep in this nice site instead of sleeping in the weeds lol.We pulled out our maps (see Pic) and decided to go for the 18 mile loop around Prairie Lake. There are also 26 miles of horse trails we could hike also but we decided on the Prairie Lake loop. Maybe we will do the 26 mile horse trails on another trip. When our gear was packed, we wasted no time, strapped on our packs and headed for the trailhead .01 mile from our site #7 at 10:30am. My pack felt heavy on my shoulders at 35 lbs. Paul carried our food in the bear bag. Thank you Paul. After 1 mile I asked if we could take a breather. We were both sopping wet from sweat as it was going to get to 94 degrees today. I tried to adjust my straps on my pack because it felt like all of the weight was leaning backward. The next couple miles were slow in the extreme heat. We were drenched in sweat. My body was like ""what the hell are you doing to me!!!"" Before we hit the trail I emptied 2 bottles of water into one of my hiking water bottles. I had been sucking down water almost as bad as I was sucking air at this point. Then I realized I only have 2 little bottles of water left in my pack. Mistake #2. I should have brought along 8 bottles. It was time for a little snack so we opened a Tropical fruit trail mix that I brought along. OMG it was soooo good. It had big chunks of pineapple in it that really hit the spot. When you bit into one of those dried pineapple chunks you could just feel the energy soaring into your body. Paul was all about the trail mix at this point. We hiked a couple more hours and the woods were very beautiful with all of the different shades of green.Around 2PM we stopped and cooked lunch. I pulled out my Rocket Wood Burning Stove and we fetched some kindling for cooking. Paul cooked the first meal on the trail. Mainly because I was probably laying face down on the trail still sucking air at this point. We had Kraft shells and cheese with a can of chicken chunks added to it. This was the best meal of the hike. Around 5pm we started looking for a place to stealth camp, but this whole trip the only place to walk was on the trail. The woods were so dense with poison oak, poison ivy and stinging nettle that you couldn't step off of the trail. Since this was a mountain bike trail and next to a lake, the trail sloped on a side hill towards the lake the whole 18 miles. This made for very hard walking, with the trail on your right higher than on your left, putting a lot of pressure on the right sides of your feet all day. Finally around 6pm we found a spot off the trail that had some grass to maybe camp in. Now when I say grass don't think of the grass in your local park, think of 4 to 5 foot high prairie grass mixed with briars, poison ivy and other funk. I put my tarp on top of the grass, the grass was holding the tarp up 4 foot off the ground. I climbed on it and smashed it all down so I could put my tent on top of it. Paul did the same with his tarp when he found a little grove of trees to hang his hammock. We were both so exhausted it was funny to us how out of shape we were. We skipped dinner and just wanted to lay down and die at this point. We only had a little trail mix and the macaroni with chicken to eat today. That was about 400 to 600 calories for each of us. We should have stopped for a big breakfast before we got here. We were in bed by 6:30pm, tired, aching, sore and totally exhausted. Goodnight all from the trail.","Jim Edgar Panther Creek SP Primitive Campground

Kezzybaum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541548,"Last night we went to bed at 6:30pm. I set up my tent on top of my tarp in the tall grass. I left my rain fly off so I could check out the stars as I drift in and out of sleep. When I first awoke it was still light outside and I could see something whizzing over my tent. There was hummingbirds buzzing around my tent. I watched them as I drifted in and out of conciseness. This was a very cool experience. Come to think of it, I never did tell Paul about the hummingbirds. Every so often I would get cramps in my calves and have to stretch them out. I even got a cramp in my hip as I tried to roll over one time. My poor body was wondering why I punished it so. One time when I awoke, it was almost dark and I could see one lone star in my path of vision. Ahhh sleeping under the stars, peaceful. Sometime during the night I awoke and heard around 20 coyotes howling and it sounded like they just scored a kill. A frenzy. That's when I noticed my star had disappeared. I see lightning lighting up the skies on all sides of me, but I could not hear any thunder. Here I am laying here with no rain fly on and my tent is on top of my tarp, crap. I announce to Paul ""There's a storm brewing"". I hobble out of my tent, attach my rain fly, slip my tarp from under my tent like a magician pulling the tablecloth off the table full of dishes without breaking a single dish. I put my backpack and the rest of my gear into my tent and covered the tent with my tarp. Paul hung his tarp over his hammock and we were back into our little nests and sleeping soundly once again. The rains came with a vengeance early in the morning around 5 or 6am. We got up at 8am and everything was soaked outside. Luckily, everything inside of my tent was nice and dry. I had a dry/clean set of clothes to wear but I knew they would be soaked in no time with soaking wet grass outside. Plus I wanted to save them for after my shower when we finished the trail. So I put my sweaty wet hiking shorts back on but I did have some dry wool socks and a dry shirt to wear today. We ate some pop tarts for breakfast and broke camp. We trudged through the tall wet grass back to the trail where Paul changed out his sandals for his trail runners. The hiking was easier today with the overcast skies and cooler temps. We took several rest stops along the way and now we had a decision to make. We can just hike 4 to 5 miles, have an easy day and stealth camp along the trail again or push and finish the trail and camp in the primitive campground tonight. We made the right choice and pushed on because now I only had 5 ounces of water left and I remembered that there was a soda machine at the boat dock near the end of the trail. Motivation.  We stopped for lunch around noon and I got the fire going in the rocket stove while Paul went to the lake for water. I cooked fettuccini noodles with a can of tuna added to it and we scarfed it down quickly. I said since we had a fire going I could make the box of Stove Top stuffing we brought along. That filled us up and as I was cooking something magical happened. I heard Paul whisper my name and that meant one thing, either someone's coming or its a predator. I looked up and it was neither. A curious doe and its newly born fawn, still with spots snuck up on us to see what we were up to. When I stood up it spooked them and off into the woods they went. We continued on our journey and I let Paul take point because maybe he won't see me struggling behind him while I'm sucking air and gasping for breath. The next thing I know Paul jumps and lets out a high pitched squeal as he steps on a snake. Now if there's one thing in this world that can make a grown ass man scream like a little girl, its a friggin snake lol. I got a good laugh at his expense on that one. It was not long after that when we came upon a grizzly scene. We found a dead raccoon right in the middle of the trail. Its head and hind leg was severed and laying next to its lifeless body. This was odd because predators don't sever the head of their prey when they eat it and the leg had the fur removed and it was nice meaty leg. If it was a coyote and something scared it off it would have grabbed that meaty ley as it ran off. We shrugged it off as an unexplained mystery and continued along the trail.There was a lot of open hiking along fields and through prairie grass today and I'm glad it was overcast because it would have been very hot. We got to a levee with finger of the lake on one side down a very steep hill and a swampy pond on the other. There was a path leading to the pond and I filled up my water bottle with swamp water and we continued on.Around 5pm we came to the dam area and off in the distance I could see the boat launch area. Yes....ice cold sodas. when we get to the parking lot we discover they took away the soda machines. Nooooooo!!! They did however have a great drinking fountain that we cameled up at and I dumped out my swamp water and refilled my water bottle with fresh clean water. We hiked over a couple of sweet bridges (see Photo) and another mile or two we can see RV's at Prairie Lake Campground. We made it!!! We stopped at the camp host and chatted with Gary and he offered to take Paul to his car a mile and a half away. Our first trail angel. I stayed behind while Paul retrieved his car because the shower house is right near the Camp host's trailer and that's where we were headed next. When Paul returned we thanked Gary once again and headed to take our showers. That warm water never felt so good. Ahhh to be clean and fresh again and smelling like soap instead of sweat, filth and funk. We asked Gary about a good place to go and grab some dinner and he said to go to the Hollywood Cafe in Chandlerville 5 miles away. I now have a new favorite place to eat. Check this place out. The Hollywood Café was clean, has great staff and had very good food. Paul ordered the daily special of 2 pieces of fried chicken (any 2 pieces you like, what? who does this? I love it!) it came with mashed potatoes, corn and a roll, oh yea, he also ordered a double bacon cheeseburger on the side. I got the breaded tenderloin horseshoe. Then she asks me what kind of fries would you like American fries, French fries or Curly fries on your horseshoe. I got curly fries. For those of you who don't know what a horseshoe is, you are missing out. It is a local thing, mainly just around Central Illinois. It's a platter with 2 pieces of bread on the bottom, then your choice of meat, which is either ham, hamburger, buffalo chicken, tenderloin etc., then they cover that huge tenderloin with my curly fries, and top the whole thing with a delicious creamy white cheese sauce. It was a belly buster. I couldn't eat it all. I also got a Mt. Dew which she gladly refilled 3 times for me. We drove back to the primitive campground and hiked back to the first/nearest site and set up camp around 7pm. We really were night owls tonight (in bed by 7:30 lol). The fog was so thick tonight. We slept until 7:30am and it was very stormy looking out. We immediately packed up and just as we were walking back to the car it started raining. It was so dark out, it looked like it was 8:30 at night but it was 8 in the morning. It stormed all the way home. I'm glad we did not stealth camp last night in the woods and have to walk 5 miles in the storm. Plus we would have missed out on that fantastic restaurant in Chandlerville IL.","Stealth camping 9 miles into the trail

Kezzybaum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541562,"All of our gear worked great. One of the best things I brought along that saved me was my new gaiters. They kept the poison ivy off my legs, helped protect my bare legs from the briars and sticker bushes. When I got home I have a few chigger bites on my body. The gaiters went from my shoes to just below my knees. The chigger bites were just above where the gaiters ended, just below my knees. So the gaiters really paid off. I love my 3 season tent. The rain fly completely covers the whole tent top to bottom. Paul really liked my Rocket wood burning stove. My 80 liter backpack was not too big. My cookware set had everything we needed, a fry pan, a pot, wooden spoon, a ladle, 2 bowls and a metal spork all under 1 pound. The most frivolous thing that I brought was my tarp and I'm glad that I brought it because the trail itself was covered in poison ivy. When we took a break I would lay down my tarp and it would give us a clean safe place to sit/lay/gasp for air. It also is great when it rains because I just throw the whole thing over my tent like a protective turtle shell and the rain doesn't even come in contact with my little home. The 2 things that I didn't use on this trip was my Leatherman and my buck knife.  Lets talk about the trail Prairie Lake Mountain Bike Trail at Jim Edgars Panther Creek State Park. The trail was 6 feet wide and had just been mowed, probably for fourth of July weekend. It was a constant set of little hills/mounds from 10 to 15 feet high. It was well groomed and clear of debris (Just a couple of blown down branches that we removed). It was fun to hike. Wild Life:5 different deer sightings5 or 6 snakes Watching the hummingbirds from inside my tentThe coyotes serenading me to sleep Many toads and frogs on the trailMillipedesMistake #1 was not eating before we hit the trail. We will correct that and in the future we will definitely eat town food before hitting the trail.Mistake #2 was not bringing enough water. I brought a whole case of water that sat in the trunk of the car. Instead of just taking 4 bottles of water, I will at least double that because when you start a trail you are sucking down water as much as you are sucking air. I will forfeit the pack weight for extra water. 2 mistakes was not too bad for our first outing and we learned our lesson from it and it's our hardships that make us stronger. Lessons were learned. I will be making many more journals of various hikes in the future so please feel free to look up my trail name Kezzybaum and walk some miles in my shoes. Please sign my guestbook and thanks for reading and following along and HAPPY TRAILS!!  
Update January 25 2017: After breaking my ankle October 14th 2016, it is still giving me fits. I guess I thought that I would be up and hiking immediately. WRONG!!! I am walking fine, but my ankle is still tender and I am wondering if it is always going to be like this. I plan on doing some hikes this spring to see how it is going to do on uneven, hilly, rocky terrain. 
After this accident happened I thought ""Well there goes my dream of Thru-Hiking the Appalachian Trail in 2018"" I sure hope I am wrong about that, because that would break my heart and my spirit. I will do everything in my power to make my Appalachian dream come true.",,A great hike to test out our gear,"Jul 07, Thu",0
