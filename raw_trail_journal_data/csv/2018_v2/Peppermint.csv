Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580163,"Ever since I was 19, I have wanted to thru-hike the AT. You can count me amongst the generation of folks that were inspired by Bill Bryson after reading A Walk in the Woods. So cliche, I know. I knew nothing about the trail before I read that book but have spent lots of time in the outdoors throughout my life. Being a CO native, my experience is mostly concentrated here in our great state and the incredible high country it provides. I've summited somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 dozen 14,000 foot mountains and will eventually climb all 58 in the state. I have backpacked plenty of times but never for more than one week at a time. The longest I've ever camped was during a float of the Grand Canyon the summer after I graduated from college. That was over two weeks of sleeping under the stars and it was freaking incredible. I have decided to begin a journal now in anticipation of attempting a thru-hike in the spring of 2018. I figure I need to start vocalizing my intention to actually do this and put it out there. They say every thru-hiker must answer the question: Why do I want to hike the AT? Without a clear answer to this question, you will most assuredly fail. For me, it's a combination of things. I sometimes worry that I have too many reasons for wanting to do this without having one really great reason but I suppose too many is better than too few. Here is what I've come up with:-It's a pretty massive undertaking and I want to prove that I can make it. To see it through all the way to the end.-I've never spent more than a couple weeks outside of my home state. Being away from home for months on end is something I should probably experience.-I've not spent a lot of time in the eastern US, I would love to see more of this part of the country.-The idea both exhilarates and scares me. I look forward to the experience both for the joy and the misery, this won't be a vacation.-I've wanted to do this for almost two decades and I'm at a point in my life where I think I can logistically pull it off.That's what I've got for now, maybe I'll discover other reasons as I start to put things together. For now, I am in the planning stages, considering gear choices, sketching out timelines, researching the exploits of others who have both succeeded and failed. With a tentative start date sometime in the first two weeks of March, I have just over four months to get my proverbial shit together. I intend to update this journal at least once a month as the departure date approaches, possibly more depending on what happens between now and then. It begins.",,View Entry,"Nov 01, Wed",0
Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582989,"Have been slacking on getting entries in here but I am going to try to make a weekly posting now that I'm 5 weeks out. I've got a lot of gear dialed in at this point and getting more comfortable with some of the smaller details of my hike. I have booked my flight from Denver to Atlanta for March 20th and will plan on starting the trail either the 21st or 22nd depending on if I meet up with family friends before the start. It still seems pretty surreal and I have to get a couple major things done before I go, namely selling the Jeep and subletting my condo. Gear wise, I have one large item yet to acquire (sleeping bag) and a bunch of minor things that will be fairly easy. These last couple months have flown and I'm sure the remaining time will go even faster! Still trying to get in some quality ski days and time with friends and family, it's gonna be hard being away from CO for such a long stretch. More updates to come!",,View Entry,"Feb 15, Thu",0
Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584420,"It's here, it's real, it's happening. My place in Denver has been leased, all necessary gear has been acquired and goodbyes have been said. Was able to celebrate with a ton of friends at Trey and Jamey's last night for St. Paddys day and my liver is looking forward to cleaner living in the coming weeks and months. In two days I fly to Atlanta and will begin the trail!
 It's pretty surreal and I'm only slightly panicked. I constantly think of all the shit I maybe haven't thought of and worry that some small forgotten thing will lead to my undoing. It's probably the same mild psychosis that every thru-hiker experiences before they begin and I just have to remind myself to not overthink too much. I will have plenty of time to iron out the smaller details as I hike so as long as I don't forget to wear pants or something, it'll all work itself out over time. Even the pants thing could be worked around. 
Tomorrow is my last day in Denver and I will be doing laundry, treating clothes and gear with Permethrin (super bug killer), and going through the gear shakedown again. It's been so great to stay with Mad Dog and Val at their place in Lakewood and to have them as my home base for storage and to send packages when needed. 
I plan to be keeping daily entries on the trail so bookmark this page so you can keep up with me as I go! I'll try to remember to periodically post this to Facebook and will be using Instagram (tobiasrottman) for most picture sharing. So if you've always resisted signing up for the Insta, I may be the asshole that forces your hand now. Forgive me. 
More to come tomorrow.",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Sun",0
Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584600,"Been a whirlwind couple days and I dont know if Ill sleep well tonight despite this being my last soft bed for a while and my last night as a non-dirtbag for hopefully many months! Mad Dog dropped me at the airport bright and early yesterday and I made the flight to Atlanta, although I cut it pretty close . I took the train from the airport to the northern part of the city where I was picked up by my old family friends, the Lehrs. Our families have been close since before I was born and I havent seen them in years. So nice to have them host me these last two days and provide clutch assistance in getting my things together. We sat through rain and wind last night at a high school soccer game (so as to toughen me up apparently) and then caught dinner close by. Today we ran around town to get the last few necessary items (groceries, stove fuel). Ill start tomorrow morning at Springer Mountain (about an hour north of here) and Im shooting for a somewhat significant mileage day (15 miles) in order to avoid heavier crowds at the first shelter. This may be overly ambitious but we will see. I mean, its only hiking, amiright?More to come once Im able to connect. Have no idea how spotty my coverage will be in the coming days, weeks, and months but I fully intend to post updates for each day on the trail as soon as Im on the grid. And you know what they say about good intentions...They always lead to the expected outcome and no one is ever disappointed. Thanks again to Ken, Marsha, Meredith and Drew for being such gracious hosts here in Atlanta!",,View Entry,"Mar 21, Wed",0

Miles: 16.7
Started early from Ken and Marsha’s to get to springer mountain. I didn’t sleep well last night with thoughts of the coming adventure crowding my brain. We made a quick stop at McDonald’s for some breakfast sandwiches and made the hour drive north. The road to the trailhead reminded me of many 14er approach roads and we would not have made it without an suv and Marsha’s skillful driving. After a quick photo and goodbyes, I was finally on the trail. A quick one mile hike up to the summit of springer mountain to tag the official AT plaque and then back northbound to start my journey. 
The early morning was frigid and I was wearing a down jacket for the first few miles. The weather was gorgeous the rest of the day and I was grateful to not start my hike in rain or worse.
After 8 miles I hit hawk mountain shelter to eat lunch and filter more water. I met a guy (sketch, tweak?) who had thru hiked in 2012 and he was a wealth of information and fun to talk to. I didn’t linger too long as I knew I had another 8 miles to make Gooch shelter and a beastly ascent up sassafras mountain. The elevation may not be as high as Colorado but the vertical feet I’m tackling are demanding for sure. 
I was pretty gassed after reaching Gooch mountain and since the shelter itself was already at capacity, I found a tent site below the main area next to Eric who is from Hawaii and was celebrating his bday on the trail. 
I went through the process of setting up camp, cooking dinner and trying to organize myself so that this process would become smoother over the coming days. I’m adjusting to almost all new gear so it’s taking some time for me to get in that groove.
Overall impression of the day was extremely positive. I’m still really nervous about a lot but I feel like I can do this if I just keep one thing at a time ahead of me. The people are awesome and the sense of community out here is great. We had 22 people in camp last night and most of us are attempting a thru-hike. Everyone is super excited to be out here and they are friendly, helpful, and just generally fun. 
A lot of miles today and hoping to put in another sizable day tomorrow  my body will allow it. Day one in the books!",,Gooch Mountain Shelter,"Mar 22, Thu",0
Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584824,"Last night was interesting. I got all settled in for the night, was pretty comfortable and just as I was drifting off, heard a rustling in the leaves outside my tent. I immediately thought “mouse” and opened the tent to pull my pack from the vestibule to the inside of the tent. I laid down and immediately heard a scratching noise coming from the pack. I immediately opened the tent and gave it a good shaking, hoping to scare the culprit out and turned on my headlamp to discover that indeed a mouse has chewed through the mesh side pocket on my hip belt and found a bag of salt and vinegar almonds that I’d neglected to store with the rest of my food in the bear box. Not finding the mouse, I assumed he’d scared off an I rezipped the bottom of my tent. I turned off my headlamp and before I could even lay back down I saw the silhouette of a mouse trying to scamper up the zipper to escape. I completely freaked out at this point. I threw open the zipper, turned on my headlamp and in the ensuing chaos, knocked down my trekking pole that supports the front of the tent and collapsed the whole thing in on myself. I rolled out of the tent, pullled my pack out and stood up in my skivvies totally flabbergasted. I ditched the almonds, propped the tent back up and did a thorough shaking out to make sure the little bastard had in fact vacated for good. Satisfied, I resettled into my bed but then realized I had a secret weapon. Peppermint oil! Mice hate peppermint oil. I opened the small vial I was carrying in my toiletry kit and went ham on my tent and pack. The smell was almost overpowering but I was going to make damn sure the little jerk wouldn’t come back. I finally got some sleep. Because my brother-in-law Jamie ceaselessly mocks me for carrying peppermint oil and all my gear is now pungent with that fresh scent, I have adopted the trail name, “Peppermint”. All thru hikers go by a trail name instead of their given name because it’s easier to remember and it speaks to a unique story (usually some kind of fuck up) that characterizes the person. Could be worse, I’ve read about a guy named “Piss Shoe”. Anyway, thanks Jamie for the handle.The rest of the day was relatively uneventful. I  slept in later than most because of my late night shenanigans and was last one to leave camp. I encountered my first instance of trail magic (typically food distributed by good samaritans along the trail at road crossings). It was a group handing out apples, breakfast sammies, and coffee. I just grabbed an apple and snacked on that at a high point with incredible views a couple miles up the trail. I eventually connected with another group that I had tented near the previous night and we pushed to a campsite with a nice wind break behind a hill. Just over 10 miles and feeling generally good despite a couple hot spots on my feet that may require taping to avoid blisters. On to Neels Gap tomorrow and possibly beyond but I may be enticed by the siren call of a hostel with shower and pizzas. We shall see.","Gooch Mt 
",Jarrard Gap,"Mar 23, Fri",10.40
Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584927,"Slept off the trail on an abandoned service road last night that gave us good protection from the wind and the forecasted rain never materialized. Winning.Hiked fairly early to get up and over Blood Mt whose reputation and name far exceeded the actual challenge. It was a gray morning with intermittent rain and most of my wet clothing was attributed to sweat rather than falling water. Made good time to the summit where there was a cool stone shelter but not the kind of place you’d want to sleep. It was damp, dank, and dirty. I took a quick moment to phone the Blood Mt Cabins to see if there were  any rooms left but no luck, they’d booked out early this morning. My best hope for a dry bed and avoiding the 100% rain overnight forecast was a bunk in the hostel at Neels Gap. I made quick time down the other side of the mountain and caught up with a familiar face at the bottom who said they still had 4-5 spots left for the night. I hurried inside the outfitter and was able to get one of the remaining spots for the night. The store there also sold Red Baron pizzas which they cooked for you there. You better believe I housed the whole thing in one sitting. After speaking to one of the gear pros there, I bought a much lighter food bag and probably shaved at least two pounds of pack weight by getting rid of the heavier sack I had and a bunch of food I had ovebought. Every outfitter has a hiker box for gear and one for food where you can drop things you don’t want to carry and pick out stuff you might need. I scooped up some better sock liners and sunscreen from the gear box.After settling my gear on the bunk I was able to get a hot shower and settled in to watch movies with my fellow hikers on the main room. The Phantom Menace is still a garbage flick but watching that on a bean bag chair with a full stomach was heaven. A most unexpected and welcome surprise arrived right at dinner time. A local church group showed up with a full spread of bbq for those of us staying at the hostel. Trail magic! Shredded pork sammies, pork ribs, beans, potato salad and cookies. Second dinner was in full effect. The pastors brother had finished his thru hike last year and now he and his wife and others from the church enjoy surprising hikers with food at the hostel. Really nice people and amazing bbq! Had a chance to charge the electronics and read about 100 pages of Bill Bryson’s “A walk in the woods”, the book that started me on this crazy idea. It was amusing reading about his adventure through the section of the trail that we’d just passed through and I’m relieved to say I’m making much better time than he did to this point. When he started talking about the steep climbs and demanding peaks that will welcome us in N Carolina in the coming days, I wisely decided to turn in for the night. Hoping to grab another double digit mileage day tomorrow....","Jarrard Gap
",Neels Gap,"Mar 24, Sat",4.90
Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584934,"Slept pretty well in the bunk room last night, the symphony of snoring didn’t keep me awake  at all. Had a leftover philly cheese sandwich from last night for breakfast and hit the trail just before 9. The day was foggy and soupy but not terribly cold. It was a great day to pop in my headphones and jam out while chewing up miles. Stopped for lunch at a cool rock overhang with matt and naps and then hiked solo the remaining 6 miles to Low Gap. The shelter was already full but they had a big campfire going so I popped down and made some hot chocolate and got dry and warm by the fire. I set up my tent a bit higher on the ridge where the wind was persistent but no rain in the forecast so I should be ok. Mostly hung with everyone down by the fire and am happy that so many from my first night at Gooch are still making the same camps each night. Eric was already here when I arrived and shortly after Matt and naps rolled in. A bit later Jamie (now Jukebox), Michael, Girl Scout, Audrey, rambling rose, blue jay, and easy bake all made an appearance. Having trail family makes this a lot easier when we can all discuss plans for the days ahead and commiserate together about the not-so-perfect weather. We are looking toward another decent (13 mile) day tomorrow and hopefully slightly improved weather. Haven’t really seen the sun in two days so that would be a nice change.","Neels Gap

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585197,"Last night sucked. The wind was roaring all night and it was pretty cold. Restless sleep meant a late start this morning. The trail was really good this morning though and all the steep stuff was later in the day. The climb out of Unicoi Gap was no fun. We set up at Cheese Factory camp tonight, so named because it was a dairy farm in the 19th century. It’s a cool camp with lots of low trees and there are a lot of us here again. Good campfire and will try for Deep Gap Shelter tomorrow.","Low Gap Shelter
",Cheese Factory Camp,"Mar 26, Mon",13.40
Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585545,"Slept pretty well last night. Temps were much warmer than last night and our camp at Cheese Factory was sheltered by a lot of low trees that kept the wind out. I was sliding toward the bottom of my tent throughout the night but having pitched it with a tree trunk near the base, I was able to use my foot to push against the tree and slide back into position. Gotta use whatever works.
The weather was fog soup again today with lots of mist and some light spitting rain. I made good time in the morning getting up and over Tray Mountain but was fairly chilly. I could only stop for a couple minutes to snack before starting to get cold and since I didn’t want to unpack warmer clothes, I pushed on to camp. The final 2 miles in to Deep Gap Shelter went over Kelly’s Knob and it was a bitch of a climb. I don’t know how they differentiate between a knob, hill, or mountain but we all agreed that it was one of the tougher ascents we had seen.
A lot of people in Deep Gap Shelter camp but I decided to claim a spot inside the shelter up in the loft, this will be my first time sleeping inside one of these but it seems like a relatively comfortable and dry option. We had a nice campfire again this evening and good company all around. Will do a short day tomorrow and get a ride in to Hiawassee to resupply, eat some town food and have a shower and real bed at the budget inn. Can’t wait.","Cheese Factory Camp

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585550,"God I hate mice. Slept very poorly in the Shelter last night thanks to the nocturnal busy bodies that continue to plague my existence. They were very active last night and I could hear them scratching around in backpacks all night. I was certain they were in my things so I continued to reach over and smack my backpack to scare them off. It’s a given that they will be a presence in most shelters but I have no idea how anybody can sleep through that shit. When i got my pack off the hook in the morning, sure enough, another small hole had been chewed through one of my upper pockets. They were after the few Rolaids I had in my med kit. Goodbye Rolaids. I was surprised there wasn’t more damage to my pack until I saw that it was Matt, a fellow bunker who had suffered the most attention from them. His trash bag liner was filled with shredded toilet paper and other nesting material. Apparently the mice thought they’d found a new home in his pack and this was the noise I was primarily hearing throughout the night. I’m going to be avoiding shelters from now on unless absolutely necessary. I’d sooner soak or freeze to death in my tent than lie awake all night listening for those little bastards.The hiking was fast and downhill this morning and by the time we made the road crossing at Dicks Creek, the sun was even threatening to shine. A most welcome sight after not seeing it at all for the past three days. Naturally, it decides to come out on the day we head in to town. Our ride arrived in the form of a rusty old van from the Budget Inn and we piled in, every one of us excited to gorge ourselves on our specific food cravings and to get a hot shower and clean clothes. I showered immediately upon check in and threw my clothes in the washer before joining Eric, Jon, and mike over at Zaxbys chicken for a combo meal that never stood a chance. Popped over to Barney’s bar and grill after that to drink a few beers while I waited for my laundry to dry and watch a couple fellow thru hikers attempt a 5 minute burger and fry challenge that no one came close to defeating. I then walked down to Ingles grocery with John and proceeded to overbuy on food for the trail yet again. I really need to find a way to cut weight out of my food bag but I want to buy all of the things when I shop!We returned our groceries to the hotel and all headed to a Mexican restaurant at the end of town to celebrate Audrey’s birthday. Solid meal and margarita and they handled our group of 20 like pros. Fat and happy, we returned to the budget inn where we were able to have a campfire and drink a few more beers before finally turning in. I like town days. Tomorrow we will get a shuttle to get back on the trail and try to make it 10+ miles to the NC border before making camp.","Deep Gap Shelter
",Hiawassee GA (via Dicks Creek Gap),"Mar 28, Wed",3.60
Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585551,"Even a crap mattress in a shitty motel is better than most nights in a tent. Slept well and rolled out of bed at 9:30 to start getting packed and ready for our 11am shuttle back out to the trail. Had been watching the weather forecast and while today looked nice, they were calling for an inch of rain or more tonight . I suggested to the group that we might want to sleep at a shelter site tonight instead of a tent site in case we needed to hide under an actual roof. This would mean holding off on our first state crossing until tomorrow but no one wanted to be soaked for the next three days so we opted to shoot for Plum Orchard Shelter. I grabbed a Subway sandwich just before the shuttle left and scarfed half of it and saved the other half for second lunch. The hike in was somewhat steep but the weather was nice and we arrived at the shelter while there were still some spots up top in the loft. This was the first and only shelter that I know of that has a 3rd level which was kind of cool. I decided to claim a spot despite my trepidation about mice because Id do most anything to avoid an inch or more of rainfall that night. I was further relieved to read the recent entries in the shelter log that specifically mentioned how this one was miraculously mouse-free. I had both my subway sandwich and some leftover fajitas from town which I wrapped in a tortilla and cooked on the fire grate. That combined with some trail magic snacks (banana, brownies, Gatorade) meant I wouldnt lessen my food bag by a single ounce tonight despite it being far too heavy already. Oh well, Ill gladly carry a bit of extra weight if it means I can eat real food instead of camp food. Fingers crossed for a decent night of sleep, the shelter is jam packed as we everyone is anticipating the heavy rain. At the very least Im sure the symphony of snores will be in full effect.","Hiawassee

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585605,"The shelter was relatively good last night. Tight quarters but no sign of mice and the rain did come down hard for a few hours. Was able to sleep well despite some extremely loud snorers. I need to remember to put in ear plugs.This morning we crossed into NC and left GA behind! One state down, only 13 to go! As soon as you cross the border, the trail gets vertical and the weather up high was cold, soupy, windy crap. I was shivering as I pushed through exhaustion to get up and over the hills today. I stopped briefly at muskrat Creek Shelter to eat something but was too cold to stay put. I ran on fumes to get into the camp at Deep Gap. Fortunately, the weather was clearing this afternoon and after I set up my tent, there were clear skies and sunshine. Dragon (a former green beret) was in camp and he started a fire and shortly after we had some trail magic show up in the form of PBR and fresh cantaloupe. Clear skies are expected for tomorrow and a full moon above tonight.","Plum Orchard Shelter

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585624,"Last night was probably the coldest night yet. The sky was totally clear and the moon was full so I burrowed down in my bag to hide from the temperature and blinding moonlight. Had frost all over my pack and outside of the tent this morning. Things got warm as soon as the sun came up and we were visited by a couple more trail angels who brought carrots, hard boiled eggs and cocoa. A church group was setting up a massive hiker feed up at the road crossing where they were going to make omelettes and pack lunches. We decided we couldn’t wait for them and left camp around 10:30 while they were still setting up. We climbed over Standing Indian Mt this morning and that marked the first time the trail reached over 5000’ elevation. The hiking was good today and the trail was relatively flat in the afternoon. It was also sunny all day which was great. Made Betty Creek camp around 4 and set up tents in some low trees right by the creek. At dinner, we shocked a section hiker with the amount of food we were demolishing. He just kept staring wide eyed as we finished round after round of food. The hiker hunger is setting in. Tomorrow we will hike another 12 to get into Franklin where we will overnight and then take a zero day in town on Monday. Everyone is eager for a full day of rest.","Deep Gap camp

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585684,"Slept pretty well last night although it was still fairly cold. Got an early start so that we could get up and out of camp. Albert Mt was a steep albeit short climb and was greeted with incredible views up top. Climbed up the fire tower for an even better perspective and got some good photos including the 100 mike Mark tagged on the tower stairs. It was so nice that I hung out for a while and eventually the place was getting pretty crowded. Everyone was excited for a sunny Easter Day and many of us had plans to get into Franklin tonight. I high tailed it down the other side of the mountain because there was supposed to be a church group doing mega trail magic at Rock Gap at 2pm. I arrived just before that and waited with my crew until just after 3 but no trail magic materialized. We decided to haul ass for the last 3.5 miles so that we could get into town and enjoy the amenities of regular society. We called Ron Haven from the road crossing and he came up in his van to gather us up.  Ron owns one of the hostels in town and used to own both of the budget inns we stayed at. Ron was a character and one of my favorite people I’ve met yet. He gave us the run down on all things Franklin as well as helpful info about resupply before the Smokys. After throwing laundry in at the budget inn, I walked with Erik and John to the lazy hiker brewery. It was a perfect evening for some patio beers and we had a couple before they closed. After, we walked to mulligans, the local sports bar for burgers and more beer. Erik devoured a burger about as fast as I’ve ever seen a human or animal eat anything. He’s got the hiker hunger for sure. We also stopped off at the gas station for junk food as well as grabbing two pies from Dominoes on the way back to the motel. Suffice to say I was uncomfortably full when I finally laid my head down. Gotta get while the getting is good. Will take a full zero tomorrow and enjoy more decadence in the form of food and drink.","Betty Creek

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585832,"Bed sleep does a body good. It was so good in fact that Head Chef, Butter and I slept right through our alarms and skipped the free pancake breakfast at the Baptist church. It’s fine, there will be another one tomorrow. The three of us opted instead for a post 10am coffee and breakfast at a diner on Main Street. Head chef had killed his French toast and bacon before I even had a chance to ketchup my hash browns. There is growing concern that he has a tapeworm.After a brief test back at the budget inn, butter and I decided to check out Curahee brewery on the other side of town. Some solid beers there and they went down quickly. We were joined by the gals (ibex, Juke box, Girl Scout and Audrey). After about 5 drinks, we decided to rally and head back across to lazy hiker brewery, stopping quickly first at the dollar general for food resupply. My brilliant (semi-drunken) idea was that if I only bought what my arms could carry, I couldn’t possibly overbuy. Wrong. Even without shopping cart I did considerable damage and in my slightly toasted state made some questionable nurtrtional choices. It’s all calories though, right?We had a few more at lazy hiker and reconnected with several folks who had just arrived in Franklin for their rest day. It’s fun having such a large hiker bubble where you are constantly bumping into friends. The night ended back at Mulligans for a Reuben, yeungling and shot of jager. Not my call but I did it anyway. We will shuttle back to the trail tomorrow and shoot for another double digit day. Solid zero day, definitely drank most of my calories.","Franklin NC

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585838,"The alarm went off early and I didn’t particularly want to rise but I knew a free pancake breakfast would be good fuel for a big day. The good people of First Baptist church in Franklin put on a daily shuttle and breakfast for all thru hikers from mid March to mid April. Very generous and was happy to partake. Had a chance to weigh myself and have dropped 4.5 pounds in less than 2 weeks. Not at all surprising when you consider my less than stringent diet and exercise regiment prior to starting.We returned to the budget inn and organized our things ahead of the 11am shuttle back to winding stair road Gap. My pack felt heavy once again after resupply, not to mention the four beers I opted to pack out rather than leave behind. I’m a glutton for punishment but you can’t just leave soldiers behind like that. Head chef continues to outdo himself with the food bag, this time finding room for two frozen steaks and two pork chops. He wisely left behind a pound of cornbread mix, not because it was too heavy but because he’d accidentally bought low fat.Ron Haven, our favorite hostel owner and city councilman gave us a lift back to the trail and rattled off some history about the Native American tribes of the area and a theory about the origin of our planet’s moon. Ron is a Rennaissance man if I’ve ever met one. He shook our hands as we headed off and told us to call him anywhere between here and Shenandoah if we get in a jam because he knows everyone between here and there.The hiking was particularly taxing today with a lot of uphill. Temps reached the 70s for the first time since I started and I was absolutely crushing water all day. I doubt the ten drinks I had yesterday had anything to do with it. By the time I reached the fire tower atop Wayah bald, I could barely walk. Still had a couple miles to the planned shelter stop so I didn’t linger long. When I reached the shelter, butter and the ladies were just watering up and announced their intention to push 1.3 miles to another campsite. I reluctantly agreed and suffered my way the last little bit to camp. The beers in my pack were room temp but still delicious and we settled in to our tents shortly after dinner. Supposed to rain pretty good tonight so fingers crossed we stay somewhat dry.","Franklin NC

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586019,"Got my first real taste of rain while tent sleeping last night and it was less than ideal. Pretty steady pouring for a few hours led to some pooling in the corners of my tent. I need to work out some of the finer points of staking my corners to avoid the drips that caused this. On the bright side, I have been questioning why I’m carrying a camp towel for almost two weeks. Turns out it’s great for sopping up standing water inside the tent. I awoke to a wet tent, as well as bottom of my sleeping pad and down quilt. Luckily my clothes bag was relocated before anything inside got soaked. It was a really chilly morning and my hands were numb after packing up all my wet gear. We had a lot of miles to trek so I scarfed some cold pop tarts and water and started up the trail. The weather improved as the day wore on and by mid day I was sweating and back down to a T-shirt. We stopped at a road gap before a big uphill climb and met a family from Michigan who were out here for spring break to climb some hills. They offered to share their picnic lunch with us. Big mistake. We descended like locusts on their leftover Easter ham, fresh fruit, cheese and crackers and chips. They didn’t realize they were offering up trail magic and several more hikers arrived to partake. They were incredibly nice and gracious and the dad kept saying he didn’t want to take any leftovers back with them. No problem there. I ate my fill, thanked them profusely and started trudging again. The climb to the top of Wesser bald wasn’t easy but the views from the fire tower up top were worth it. The sun was out and I took the oppprtunity to dry my tent and quilt up on the sunny ridge while enjoying the views for a bit. We still had 5+ miles to go so we couldn’t linger too long. The end of the day was long and by the time our group staggered into camp, few words were exchanged as we set up tents and got dinner working. It felt good to log a bigger mileage day but we also felt like we paid the price. Hoping to make a stop at nantahala outdoor center a mile down the trail  tomorrow morning for a mini resupply and lunch before an afternoon of big uphills. ","Licklog Gap

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586023,"Slept well last night and was glad that we had pushed more miles to a lower camp because it was supposedly cooler up high. Arose fairly late but with fewer miles planned, wasn’t sweating it. The one mile down to Nantahala Outdoor Center was quick and easy. The Nantahala River flows through here and there are options for kayakers and white water rafters to play in the water. Was kinda wishing I could stay. Popped into the general store and got some ibuprofen and then crossed over to the outfitters. Juke box’s mom had sent her an Easter care package so I indulged on some jelly beans and chocolates first. In the outfitter, I was looking for a couple things. Firstly, my metal belt buckle on my Prana pants had snapped yesterday and I’m in the market for a new pair. I’ve had these for over a decade so it may have been foolish to hope they would survive this trek. Unfortunately they have a built in belt without any loopholes for another belt so once they broke, they became kinda worthless. I’m still carrying enough of a gut that they will stay up but I’m losing weight by the day. I wasn’t in love with any of the options in the store so I’m hoping to make these last until I find another pair that works. I did snag a lightweight quick-dry hoodie as I’m having trouble finding something that I can wear that is a happy medium between freezing in a T-shirt on the trail and overheating like a sweat pump with my ski performance layer. This should do the trick. We lunched at the restaurant on the river (fish tacos and cherry coke) and then lazily gathered ourselves up before hitting the trail again. It was a mostly uphill afternoon but we made decent time. Juke box, head chef and I had split up a six pack of Lt. Dank IPA and we enjoyed a sunset drink up on the ridge at sassafras Gap. I have a sweet little tent site with beautiful views and it is supposed to be calm and temperate overnight. Nice little day on the trail.","Rufus Morgan Shelter

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586147,"Good sleep last night and a calm morning. Got my things together and left camp at the same time as the ladies today. It was a steep early climb up to the first bald (a treeless, grassy patch found atop many hilltops). Broke quickly for a snack and discussed our target for the evening camp. Despite my concern for heavy rain, the consensus seemed to be that pushing to a tented campsite would be better so that we would have fewer miles tomorrow into Fontana Dam. No sooner had we agreed on Cody Gap camp as our destination, the sky started to spit rain. It was not yet noon and the forecast was steady to increasing rain into the night and through tomorrow morning. What fun. I made decent time getting to Stecoah Gap and took a break there with a few others to get out of my pack, eat a snack and rest my feet. A local guy from Robbinsville pulled up and offered up apples and cucumbers and I took one of each. Always grab fresh produce when you can. Our little group again reconvened and confirmed the plan to get to Cody Gap camp in about 5.5 miles. At this point, I noticed the guide mentioned a steep climb up something called “Jacobs Ladder” about a mile past the road. I was the first to light out and sure enough, after a mile the trail went straight up the hill to the unseen ridge top. This was easily the most relentless climb we’ve seen yet and there was no relief from the sheer vertical punishment. I kept my eyes on the trail directly in front of me to keep from collapsing in despair. The trail will typically always go over the highest point on any given ridge and today I truly resented that fact for the first time. The next 3.5 miles into camp were some of the toughest I’ve hiked yet, not because they were steep but because I was so spent and the shit weather was taking a toll on my psyche. I half jogged in the increasing rain until I finally hit camp and dragged my feet down the draw to the bottom of the gap where the streams were. Being too tired to hike back to the ridge, I pitched my tent in the flattest spot possible and got as much of my gear inside as possible to keep it from getting soaked. I ate a cold dinner being too exhausted to get the stove going and not wanting to fight the rain while cooking. I got in my tent around 5 and just checked some of the maps for the upcoming trail while listening to music and waiting for dark. The rain would only increase through the night so I settled in for a long night. Not the best day, anticipate being rather water logged by morning. Hopefully the temps won’t drop too low.","Sassafras Shelter

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586188,"The rain did not disappoint last night. It kept coming steadily throughout the late hours. At a certain point, my front tent stake pulled out of the wet ground and the front of my tent collapsed in on me. Luckily the rain was only spitting when I went out to fix it but the readjustment caused my rear flaps to pull in against the screen and water began dripping into the corners. By morning I had standing water on both ends of the tent and the bottom of my down quilt was soaked. At this point in the trip, I’m less concerned about sleeping wet and cold as I am about drowning inside my own tent. The rain stopped falling when I got out in the morning but the world was encased in fog and dew. It wasn’t too cold but I didn’t waste any time in packing up my wet gear, not knowing how long the precipitation would be stalled. I hiked up to the trail ridge and found Juke box and head chef collecting their things and we all decided to hike the less than 10 miles to Fontana Dam together. It was fairly quick moving and we were all eager to get to the Fontana lodge where the group had decided to overnight. The temps are supposed to drop into the 20s tonight and that combined with wet gear could spell big trouble. We arrived at the 28 road crossing and called the shuttle to come pick us up. The Fontana lodge was a nice hotel and I felt like a dirtbag shuffling through the lobby. Was able to pick up my packages from Amazon (indomie noodles and another merino wool T-shirt) and mad dog and Val’s food resupply (thanks guys!). After a hot shower, we all popped down to the wildwood grill where I got down on pizza, wings and beer. All too happy to be in a dry bed tonight while the world outside freezes. Pending temperature and overall motivation, we may decide to stay here one more day before embarking into the Great Smoky Mountains for over a week.","Cody Gap

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586249,"The consensus was that we could all do with one more day of rest before heading into the smokies for over a week so we will stay at Fontana lodge once more tonight. After breakfast at the bistro, the group decided to slack pack the 1.4 miles between the 28 road crossing where we ended yesterday and the Fontana Dam visitors Center we will leave from tomorrow. Slack packing is just hiking a short section of the trail without all your gear when you can get transportation to the start and stop points. This way we don’t have to hit that section in the morning ahead of a double digit mileage day. The hike was quick and easy and followed the edge of the reservoir before popping up to the Fontana Dam shelter and visitor center. Dragon and Honey badger joined us as they were just arriving for an overnight and zero tomorrow. We called the lodge shuttle to collect us after we finished and went for lunch at the wildwood grill. The fried green tomato blt was slightly underwhelming and I was regretting not getting a massive pizza. Damn. Just chilled in the room after eating and sized up my massive food bag for the coming week. I’m going to try to make it 100+ miles through the smokies and into hot springs NC without a resupply. Needless to say I’m carrying a shit ton of food and my pack feels super heavy. Tomorrow could very well suck given the elevation gain and maximum weight I’ll be carrying. Such is life these days.

The rain was subsiding this morning and had stopped by the time head chef and I got shuttled back to the trail near the visitor center. We crossed the road over the Dam and shortly thereafter entered the great smoky park boundary. It was just under 10 miles from there to our planned shelter stop. I was cursing the oppressive weight of my food bag as I made my way up into the hills. Moving slowly, I counted off the miles slowly. Came to the shuckstack firetower which apparently has incredible views of the park on a clear day. Not today. The sky was fog soup so I just continued on. The afternoon kind of dragged and I was spent by the time I arrived at the shelter. There was still room inside so I opted to grab a spot up top. Made a small dent in my food bag before hanging it on the bear cables for the night.

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587176,"Slept decently in mollies ridge Shelter last night save one nearly critical mishap. Had to piss in the middle of the night and rather than lower myself from the top level down to the platform, I decided to hop feet first down and I did not stick the landing. I clipped the platform below with my foot and spilled onto the dirt floor, skinning my knee and nearly crushing my wrist under my own weight. Picked myself up and saw that miraculously no one else in the shelter had stirred at all despite my crashing and cursing. Smooth.
The morning was cool but the sky was clear and the trail was good. I stopped with Juke box, ibex, Girl Scout and head chef at a grassy field just before the uphill section of the day started. What was intended to be a few minutes of rest turned into an hour of lazy conversation and catnapping. It’s great to be able to take advantage of these kind of spots on the trail and we all look forward to many more sunny days when we can just relax, take in the sun and views and just generally enjoy being where we are.
The climb up over rocky top wasn’t too tough and there we found Audrey (now glow stick) and took another long snack break/photo op session. It was a perfectly clear and calm day so we were in no great hurry to get to camp. The rest of the day was a roller coaster of ridge climbing and descents and the last little push up to the shelter was a full mile of pretty steep uphill. 
The shelter was packed and we were all too happy to set up our tents instead. We also made friends with two dogs that had been leapfrogging hikers all day. Apparently they are trained bear dogs that had decided to come up into the Smokies on their own from Robbinsville some 40 miles away. One of our group had contacted their owner and he sounded like this wasn’t the first time that they had lit out on their own and he would come up to newfound Gap in two days to collect them when they arrived with our bubble of hikers. We named them Smoky and the Bandit and they ate like kings around camp tonight. Guess we have a little extra bear protection tonight","Mollies Ridge Shelter
",Derrick Knob Shelter,"Apr 10, Tue",12.10
Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587177,"Good sleep last night and awoke to another very cool morning. There was a small wind break next to the shelter where the sun was starting to come up where I stood to eat breakfast and slowly warm up. Was in no great hurry to get out of camp despite a decent day of mileage and vertical ahead. As I was getting the last of my things together, John (butterstuff) rolled in to camp having made up significant miles to catch the group after we last saw him in Fontana. A few of us hung around with him while he made a quick coffee and snack. It was nearly 11 before we left camp and we planned to get over Clingmans Dome today and log a dozen plus miles.
Made quick work of the early trail and it wasn’t long before we arrived at silers bald shelter for a fast lunch. Butterstuff, Juke box and I ate quickly then tackled the next section to double spring gap where we filtered water before the climb up Clingmans. Rebel Yell had caught up to us and joined us for the ascent through the dense alpine forest. The trail looked more like the pacific NW here and the change of scenery was not lost on the group. A steady climb eventually brought us to the final ridge where we nearly dropped off the main trail and headed toward the parking lot instead of the proper summit. Two local Tennesseans noticed our mistake and pointed us in the right direction. We arrived at the top to find glow stick, ibex, and Girl Scout lounging below the observation tower. Made the obligatory walk up to the top to take in the 360 views and snap a few pics. The day was getting late and a bit cooler. With 4+ miles still to go, we grabbed our packs and got back on the trail again. Made pretty good time down Clingmans and passed the 200 mile marker (woohoo!) and then a steep climb up Mt Collins on the other side. The shelter was .5 mile off trail in deep forest and I opted to grab a spot inside on the second level. Went full junior high kid at dinner and made Mac and cheese and washed it down with Hawaiian Punch. We are planning to get about 5 miles down to newfound Gap tomorrow before lunch where we can catch a free shuttle into gatlinburg for lunch and then get back on the trail again in the afternoon.","Derrick Knob Shelter

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587178,"No issues in shelter last night and slept soundly. The 5 miles to newfound Gap was pretty quick and we chatted with a trail runner for a couple minutes while she checked our permits. Arriving at the Gap parking lot, we were thrilled to find that the church who offered the free shuttle were also set up with a table full of trail magic. Grabbed a coke, orange, brownies and fruit snacks as a precursor to lunch. We piled into their vans at noon and pulled into the NOC outfitter lot 15 minutes later. Most of the crew needed at least one small item so we made our rounds and grabbed what we needed-small fuel bottle for me just to make sure I can get through the smokies. Next, we walked down the block to five guys for a burger. Got hooked up with a triple because they had thrown extra patties on when we all walked in. Threw that thing down without blinking. Walgreens next door then provided some candy weight for my food bag (red vines and coffee nips). We thought it would be a shame to miss out on a little moonshine before skipping town so we sauntered in to the closest tourist trap and did a quick tasting. Closed out the town tour with a large jamocha milkshake from baskin Robbins at a mere 1600 calories. Town diet was on point today.
We spilt into a few different groups to hitchhike back up to the gap and after we snagged some tall boys for camp, we were strolling past the last stoplight in town, head chef spotted and picked a huge morel mushroom on the side of the road. A couple local college kids gave us a lift back up to the trail and we started towards the shelter about 3 miles ahead. It was fully packed, the only remaining tent sites were directly in front of the shelter and sloped noticeably down hill. Then I discovered a larger problem: I had left my tent stakes behind, presumably two nights prior when I last tented. D’oh. I borrowed two stakes and head chef was able to quickly fashion four sticks for my corners and I was back in business for the night. I’ll have to grab some replacements in Hot Springs in a few days and will probably opt to sleep in shelters until then.

The trail ran easily along the high ridges today and we made an early stop at an outlook called Charlie’s bunion. It was only .2 miles off the trail and had some really great views of the mountains and some decent exposure. We also stopped to lunch at another great vista spot right on the trail. It was almost starting to feel hot today after the morning breeze died down. After arriving at the shelter, we discussed a plan to get off the trail ahead of a storm that would arrive in 2 days and drop 2” of rain. The plan is to see about getting a shuttle from Davenport Gap tomorrow afternoon and get into hot springs. This will bump our planned zero day up by a couple days but could be worth it to avoid super heavy rain.

Made good time to Cosby Knob Shelter and broke for a snacking lunch. When Juke box showed up, she called the hostel in hot springs to inquire about a pickup from Davenport Gap this afternoon. Even though the town is about 30 miles away on the trail, it takes quite a bit longer to drive there with the highway going around on not over the mountains. They said it would take an hour for the shuttle to get up there and they wanted $75 for the ride. Ok, no. We decided instead that we would spend one last night in the Smokies at the part shelter in the park and then hightail it tomorrow morning to Standing Bear Farm hostel to beat the heavy rain and lay low there until the storm passes the following morning. The afternoon hike was sunny and made good time down to Davenport Gap Shelter. It’s kind of a freaky looking set up with a caged front to keep bears from getting in. We call it the reverse zoo. There is virtually no flat ground anywhere around us so every one is cramming into the shelter tonight.

It was spitting rain when I hit the trail and there was just enough morning light that a headlamp wasn’t necessary. I arrived at Davenport road Gap to find a sign indicating trail magic and found three beers remaining in a six pack. Grabbed a sculpin pale ale and threw it in my pack and removed my rain coat. No sooner had I crossed the road then the rain picked up again. Quickly threw the rain jacket back on and continued through the woods and followed a beautiful creek with several waterfalls. It was still and quiet and I had the trail to myself. Knowing the hostel awaited I was I good spirits. There were several other signs on the trail indicating that trail magic was ahead but nothing materialized. After crossing I40, Juke box and head chef caught up to me and we booked the last mile to the hostel. The Farm is a funky little place with a Main house, bunk house, several cabins, a tree house and a couple communal buildings for kitchen, laundry and showers. We were relieved to learn that they could accommodate us above the main house in an overflow room. We would have mattresses and a dry roof. Good enough! Took the opportunity to shower, hand wash laundry and cook a digiorno pizza. They also sold fat tire and pbr by the can so I day drank in the kitchen with other hikers while watching the rain fall. This place is quintessential Appalachian trail community and I have really enjoyed mixing with all the other characters and dogs here today and eating junk food from their resupply store.

Did not rush in getting out the door and had a breakfast sandwich and donuts from the store while chatting with other hikers in the kitchen. Had loaned my sleeping pad to Snorts last night as she slept on the porch downstairs because it was far too wet to hammock. Collected it back and settled up my bill and we reluctantly got back on the trail. The snow was supposed to let up around noon. It did not. The climb out was steadily steep and the freezing rain down below turned to consistent snow up higher. I went from sweating to freezing in a matter of minutes and I was hating life by the time I reached the top of thunderhead mountain. I quickly dipped back down into the woods after the summit and the temp improved slightly and the snow had let up a bit too. I was aiming to get something to eat at the first shelter and hopefully reconvene with the group to see where we wanted to get to that afternoon. I slipped on the mud approaching the shelter and fully went down. First complete fall on the trail, almost made it a month without a wipeout. Luckily the soft mud absorbed my fall and I merely got caked. 
Head Chef was already there and tending to a small campfire; a quick firewood run and we had it roaring nicely. We both agreed that we could stand to stay here for the day given the inconsistent weather and sloppy trail. Juke box and Girl Scout arrived a while later and they both quickly agreed that a good campsite with a fire was a fine place to be. The shelter was full but we scoped some good flat tent sites and decided this would be an ok place to get through the cold night. The snow persisted through the afternoon and evening but never really came down hard. I knocked off about an inch of snow from the exterior of my tent before bed and after lingering by the fire for as long as possible, burrowed in for the night.

We had a small fire still burning and took our time in the chill air to eat breakfast and get packed. I was the first of our crew to leave camp and we planned to do significant mileage today as well as pass over max patch, a notable high point with supposedly amazing views. 
The first hour was great. Sun was out and things were starting to get warm again, the snow shouldn’t linger long today. I reached the road gap below max patch and started the 3.5 mile incline to the top when the winds kicked up. All of the water and snow that had frozen high in the trees the previous night was now being blown down in sizable chunks of ice. What was a somewhat beautiful forest scene quickly turned into a shooting gallery with bitterly cold swirling winds. The ascent seemed to drag on forever and I took several direct hits from the flying ice only to curse at the air and throw a fist at an unattainable enemy. It basically sucked and the higher I climbed, the deeper the remaining snow got. Eventually, I passed another gap where the forest gave way to a more exposed and less snowy clearing and the final climb up to max patch. Here, the winds really kicked up. The menacing ice barrage from above was replaced with a slick sheen of mud below me. I could barely stand against the force of the wind as it was but now had to keep my feet from sliding out on the greased ground. This also sucked. I barely had a chance to take in the panorama up top before the 50mph gusts forced me down the other side. I briefly encountered a nice couple who were waiting for their friend and they offered me a pbj which I gladly accepted and scarfed down before dropping into the woods again. From there I made it quickly to roaring fork shelter where I would snack and wait for the others to catch up.

We decided to still push for a campsite beyond bluff mountain but settled on one that was slightly closer because it was getting late in the afternoon. We all went at our own pace from there and the 8+ miles were fairly taxing after such a rough morning. Luckily, the weather was much improved and we enjoyed generally sunny skies with only a light wind. By the time we all made it to the tent site off the trail, we were spent.

Popped in to the outfitter for a few minutes and then over to creekside tavern for a few beers. The girls left to go shower back at the hostel and I stayed to have another with butterstuff, t Tex and thunderbird on the patio overlooking the French broad river. Eventually, I closed out and headed back to laughing heart but grabbed a milkshake from the hillbilly market on the way back. Chef was back at the hostel and I had been skipped on the laundry queue because I was instead drinking in town. Was able to combine a load with chef and after that was done, we all headed back to creekside for wings and more beer. I was totally stuffed but that didn’t stop us from hitting up the dollar general to pick up some Cocoa Puffs and milk for a hostel snack just before they closed.

I still slept like the dead. I poured myself three bowls of cereal before we went for breakfast at the diner. I then took down a chicken fajita omelette, cinnamon apples, a biscuit and orange juice. When we went back to bluff mountain outfitter, I took the opportunity to weigh myself. The scale showed I was down 19 pounds. I didn’t believe it and resolved to weigh in again at the scale in the hostel later. Head chef, Juke box, Girl Scout and I decided to partake in a soak at the hot springs spa and we ponied up for an hour long soak in a hot tub. The water was nice but I wished it was about ten degrees hotter. It still felt great to let the muscles marinate for a while. I picked up a care package from Laura and Jamie at the post office on the way back (new headlamp with a red light for less intrusive night usage) and of course another milkshake. We also grabbed some resupply meals from the dollar general. I decided to trim my beard and wound up doing a full shave which was traumatic for the rest of the group. Head chef had a set of clippers sent to him and he was kind enough to clean up my Mohawk back as well. We all threw on some loaner town clothes from the hostel and decided to hit creekside tavern once more for pizza and beer. We watched the bruins game and Girl Scout was letting loose with the full Minnesota accent. We wound up staying til nearly 11 before finally retiring. Oh, I verified my weight on the hostel scale again. Almost twenty pounds down inside the first month. Yikes. I should probably be trying to get more calories in on the trail and not just playing catch up in town. We will head back out tomorrow.

They told us to meet up at the post office before breakfast which was convenient as I had decided to send home some of my bulkier cold weather clothing (performance under layers top and bottom and a fleece top). I haven’t used these really at all even in sub freezing temps and felt comfortable parting with them. I just hope I’m not being preemptive. 
The crew then headed to the diner for one more meal before leaving town. Head chef, who had complained about a scratchy throat the last few days had grown increasingly quiet this morning and by the time we finished breakfast, I could tell he was feeling under the weather. We stopped by the library and smoothie shop on the way out of town and I floated the idea of staying in town one more night but camping instead of paying for the hostel. Chef seemed open to the idea but the ladies were eager to get back on the trail. I semi-reluctantly agreed that we shouldn’t get sucked in to the town for another day so we crossed the bridge over the river and began the ascent out of Hot Springs.

I found a flat area a bit higher up that had some incredible views of the surrounding hills and we all decided to pitch our tents up there. I built a fire just down the hill while Juke and glow went to grab water for all of us and not long after we started our dinners, Peter Pan Squatch, johnny Appleseed and captain jack showed up and decided to join us. We enjoyed the best sunset yet on the trail from our high camp and all chatted around the fire and star gazed until it was time to turn in. Will push for some bigger miles tomorrow to make up for our lack of motivation today.","Hot Springs-Laughing Heart Hostel

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588222,"We planned to get some better mileage in today after slacking a bit yesterday and got a reasonably early start. The early morning was partly cloudy and we made pretty good time. After stopping for some cliff views around 1, the weather turned rainy and we hiked on in mixed rain for the rest a couple of hours. Things cleared up before we arrived at a road gap on the TN border where there was a little shop that sells sodas, chips, ice cream and other small snacks to hungry hikers. It was literally called “Mom and Pop’s” and I can’t think of a more perfect name. Pop (presumably) greeted us from a chair inside as we swung open the rusty old screen door and chatted us up as we made our selections. He runs this store during the day and a tavern up the road at night. Nice guy and we were ever appreciative of his little shop. I had some Doritos and an orange crush and sat out in his grass in the sun while the others rolled in. I also opted to grab an A&W for dinner that night and tossed in my backpack.
We pushed another 5 miles up Laurel Mt. and the climb up to the shelter was a long mile to end the day. I opted for a tent site behind the shelter as the evening forecast looked good. My ramen and tuna with root beer was fantastic and I felt pretty wiped so climbed into my tent right after hiker midnight (basically when it’s fully dark out). Will try for another 14-15 miles tomorrow.","Mill Ridge stealth camp

Today marks my one month trailiversary as it were. I can’t believe I’ve made it this far and I’m still having a great time out here. I realize that I’ve still got so much more to go but it doesn’t feel out of my grasp and I’m looking forward to the challenges and adventures ahead. 
We had another fine day on the trail and the hiking was mostly good. We decided to shoot for Flint Mt Shelter for tonight. Can’t say anything too exceptional or remarkable about the day’s hike. We made the shelter in good time and found it to be empty. Since there is a fair chance of rain tonight, 4 out of the 5 of us decided to sleep under the roof. Ibex and I made a fire after dinner and we chatted with Ditch and Ned who were solo thru hiking as well. Ditch had attempted the trail last year but failed due to a lack of funds and a girlfriend who refused to do more than 10 miles a day even after two months. Just before we turned in, Girl Scout reported seeing two mice in the shelter so I pulled out the peppermint oil and liberally applied some drops to my pad and clothing. Juke and ibex did the same and hopefully the little shits will leave us alone tonight. Planning almost 19 miles tomorrow and rain is in the forecast so good sleep would be nice.Ps: also hit the 300 mile mark today. Nice!","Little Laurel Shelter

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588377,"The peppermint oil was effective and was not bothered by the mice last night. There were a couple quick rain showers but slept soundly and awoke to partly cloudy skies with the promise of rain falling early and often today. Girl Scout informed us that her persistent foot pain was enough to pull her off the trail today and she planned to stop at the first hostel in about 3 miles and get a shuttle to Erwin to rest up. We quickly made it to the laurel hostel and grabbed some snacks on the outdoor patio while the heaviest predicted rain of the day passed. After an hour, we said our goodbyes to Girl Scout and headed back out in light rain. The climb was significant from that point for about the next 3 miles and when I reached the next high point, I checked my gps to find out that we still had another 13 miles to go. Ugh. I buckled down to make it another 3 miles to the next shelter for a lunch break. The rain was lightly falling when I pulled off to eat at the Hogback Ridge Shelter and waited for the others to catch up. When Juke and ibex arrived, we determined that we would in fact push to our intended destination so that we could pull another long day tomorrow to make it into Erwin. The afternoon hike was a struggle that culminated in a climb over the top of Big Bald Mt. I was hating life walking up further and further into a rain cloud. I did spot some big white tailed deer about a mile below the summit but I was in no mood to stop and appreciate nature. I pressed onward and the push over the summit was inside an immensely windy rain cloud. Fog and high winds all around me, I pressed up and over the frustratingly endless final stretch of the bald. For there, only one mile remained to the shelter but it was seemingly endless. I was crushed to find a totally full campsite when I arrived and only one spot left in the shelter. I huddled behind the structure with Jet pack and he informed me that wind gusts were expected to reach upwards of 70 mph tonight. Great. I opted to pitch my tent directly behind the shelter with the hope that it would provide some break from the wind. Juke grabbed the last shelter spot when she arrived and ibex and glow stick tented right next to me. None of us had the energy or inclination to do anything other than dive into our tents and burrow down. I made hot chocolate in my vestibule and scarfed the rest of my beef jerky and a coke I had packed out from the hostel earlier. Poor mans dinner indeed. We made a plan to get out early and race down the mountain to uncle Johnny’s hostel in Erwin where everyone had decided we could take a well earned zero the following day. We made our 18.9 miles today and will hit almost 17 tomorrow. A day off will be really nice. Despite everything, laid down tonight feeling grateful. This is still a hell of a good time and every day a new adventure. But big bald mountain can eat shit.","Flint Mt Shelter

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588379,"The winds were crazy high as advertised last night and I slept pretty terribly. Was super sore from the long miles yesterday and didn’t have a chance to stretch out at all before I’d scurried into my tent to get out of the rain. We learned that the shelter had been so full due to a group of 18 weekenders from a local Christian group. We broke our shit down pretty quickly in order to get on the trail and glow stick was able to call ahead to uncle Johnny’s hostel and reserve a four person cabin for tonight and tomorrow. Proper motivation right there. We agreed to try and reconvene at the next shelter for coffee/lunch as it was supposed to keep raining this morning 10+ miles until a decent break sounded rough but we had to get out of this cursed rain cloud and down to more temperate climes. I scarfed a couple pop tarts, threw in my headphones and lit out of camp with a clear purpose....town food, shower, laundry. That will get me moving. I passed Juke box after a few miles and she was essentially out of food so I broke a butterfinger in half and split that with her and told her I’d hold up at the next shelter to offload more snacks. It was a long hike but I made good time and was in a half jog during the last 3-4 miles before the shelter. Ibex had arrived just ahead of me and we snacked and chatted with TAB (take a break) who was also headed to town. I waited just long enough for Juke to roll in and unloaded the rest of what snacks I hadn’t eaten before the last 6 miles of trail into town. I resolved to make it there in 2 hours so I resumed my half jog pace and beared down. The sun was just starting to pop out again as I descended the trail over the nolichucky river and rolled into the hostel at almost exactly 2 hours. Girl Scout was sitting on the front porch when I rolled in along with thunder bird who we’d not seen since hot springs. I quickly checked in and grabbed a hot shower (our cabin has a private bathroom!) just before the 5pm shuttle to dinner/Walmart. Ibex had arrived in time to hop on the bus with me and we communicated with glow stick and Juke box via text to grab them some to-go dinner and booze from the liquor store. The monster Margs at los jalapeños were a revelation but the food sucked. I’m finding that east coast Mexican food is trash in comparison to what you get in the Western states. I still ate like an animal and was happy enough to be full of greasy food. We made the necessary LQ and Walmart stops to stock up on liquor, snacks, and breakfast for our zero day tomorrow. With a kitchen provided in our four person cabin, we decided to go all out and make a big meal in the morning.We returned to the hostel and got the other two gals their food and after they had eaten we got down to some drinking games. Easily the most tipsy we have gotten on the trail yet and even got loud enough to have the staff knock on our door around eleven to tell us to keep it down. Mission accomplished, I guess. I’ll crash on the futon in the living room tonight. Beats a sleeping pad. Glorious zero day tomorrow with rain in the forecast. ","Bald Mt Shelter

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588381,"Everyone woke up hungover except me and I felt like a bit of an ass popping the prosecco for mimosas as early as I did, but hey, zero day. Juke felt especially rough and barely moved off the couch as we all made breakfast. Had cheesy eggs, avocado toast, trix, and bacon. Fantastic. Our main priority for the day was laundry but the washer/dryer at the hostel was closed to hikers because their septic can’t handle the volume of wash they have been experiencing. The next option in town was a coin op laundromat that had closed a couple days ago due to a dryer fire. We finally got one of the shuttle drivers to take us out past the last exit in town to another laundromat that was open. I piled in with glow stick, Girl Scout and another hiker named Brian with all of our collective clothes to go out there. We got our wash going and then popped next door to the local diner to eat lunch and wait. I had a pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw on it as well as an iced tea and a cherry milk shake. Grand total: $6.99. Amazing. Finished laundry and called Doug the shuttle man to scoop us up and go back to the hostel. 
Juke was still hurting and we wondered if it was something other than just a hangover. She opted to join us on the 5 o clock shuttle but when she decided to skip the margaritas and simply go straight to Walmart we knew something wasn’t right. Glow stick and I threw down a pitcher of Margs and we all did a quick resupply shop and I grabbed another sixer for the evening before heading back. We had borrowed a vcr from another cabin and watched movies (Tommy Boy and Wet Hot American Summer)while organizing our things to get back on the trail tomorrow. I also read through Appalachian Trials, a book that ibex had that I’d intended to read before I left but never got a chance to. It’s basically about the mental and emotional rigor of the trail and what you need to know in order to make it through. Takeaways: 1) The VA blues are bullshit and self inflicted. VA is no better or worse than any other state, it’s just longer (will find out in about a week). 2) Lyme Disease is terrifying and a legitimate threat to thru hikers. I’ll have to start examining my nether regions like a chimpanzee in a couple weeks to avoid being felled by a tick. 3) The White Mts in New Hampshire are gonna take my lunch money and have me crying for my mother. Prepare to be humbled-in 3 months. 4)  I still have the wherewithal to do this. One day at a time. 
Juke has been wretching all day and thinks she may have gotten food poisoning from her shrimp fajitas last night. We all hope she recovers quickly and that it is only food poisoning. If she has norovirus, we could all be in for trouble as we’ve shared close quarters a lot recently. Chef is also apparently going to be arriving here tomorrow morning and we will probably just miss him if he decides to stay overnight. Hopefully he will burn extra miles this week and get caught up. ","Erwin TN

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588391,"Juke was in and out of the bathroom all night and she won’t get out today. Her plan is to get a room at Mt Inn and Suites and push liquid and try to recover. Chef showed up at 10am and we fed him the rest of our fresh cinnamon rolls and unloaded the remaining snacks that we are unable/unwilling to carry out. He is gonna post up at the Super 8 closer to town for the night and get back out tomorrow. Girl Scout is also gonna rest her foot at least one more day and possibly get back out tomorrow or Saturday. 
That means it’s just me, glow stick and ibex heading back out today. With heavy rain forecasted for the afternoon and evening, I was really tempted to stay back once more but felt compelled to start making miles again. The three of us decided to shoot for 8-10 miles and see where we landed to camp. The unfortunate part is that there is a shelter at 4.5 miles and then not another for 16. Neither seemed plausible given our 11:30 departure so we resigned to the fact that we’d be camping wet. 
The climb out of town was pretty demanding and as soon as we left the first shelter after 1pm, the rain came. It was persistent and I knew we would all be drenched by the end of the day. I also took my first real digger of the trek when I slipped on a wet root, totally lost footing and landed right knee first on a flat rock in the trail. I stood up and gingerly put weight back on the leg until I determined nothing was broken and then started hobbling forward. Luckily, the pain didn’t persist and I was able to keep trudging. 
The three of us convened at the top of a rise and hid under some trees to formulate a plan. Originally, we had thought to camp up high on a bald called Beauty Spot. Given the soaking rain, we thought better of it and decided we would seek something with a bit more tree cover. The winds were at least predicted to stay low but the rain would keep coming. As we summited Beauty Spot it dawned on me that tonight was the first night of the nfl draft. I could’ve been dry, splitting the cost of a super 8 with head chef and drinking beer in bed watching the draft. I really hated myself now. We eventually found a reasonable spot just below the bald with a piped spring nearby and decided to call it good. I had to pitch my tent twice after determining the first spot was totally slanted. I was soaked to the bone and glad to get in my dry camp clothes and hunker down. I ate the deli sandwich I’d packed out from Walmart and made hot chocolate under my vestibule then ate hot tamales for dessert. At least the wind is low tonight but everything else about today has been shyte. ","Uncle Johnny’s, Erwin TN

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588446,"The forecast said the rain would let up by 9am and I determined to stay in my tent until that happened. I could see from under my vestibule that the rain cloud we have been living in since yesterday had still not cleared. Ibex had gotten up early and broke down her tent and announced she was leaving and I knew I couldn’t wait forever so I reluctantly started piecing my things together. I got out of my dry sleepwear and picked up my soaking wet boxers, opened the tent door and actually wrung out my underwear before putting them back on. I did the same with my socks and stepped into the squishy soles of my trail runners and looked around at the dense fog surrounding me. The rain wasn’t falling hard but just enough to completely annoy me while I packed up. I also had to answer the call of nature and hated every minute of digging a cat hole in the trees and then fumbling with wet toilet paper. By the time I had packed up all my wet gear, my hands were numb and I was carrying at least 5 extra pounds of water weight throughout my pack.Of course the day began with an ascent and I silently endured the climb over the top of Unaka Mt. The trail was totally waterlogged and any hope I had of getting my feet dry was counteracted by inches of standing water and mud underneath. Eventually I topped the forested summit (actually really cool but was in no fucking mood) and began down the trail on the other side. At some point before Cherry Gap Shelter, the sun actually started to shine through the impenetrable cloud cover. By the time I walked in to the camp, there was even a sliver of blue sky and I found ibex and glow stick waiting there with a campfire to boot! I took the opportunity to get everything wet out of my pack and hastily string my tent over some nearby tree branches. In the half hour I spent there, I was able to half dry my tent and warm myself by the fire. The sky seemed to be clearing and the clouds were thinning above while I ate enthusiastically from my food bag. With another 9 plus miles ahead, the three of us repacked our gear and set out again, this time with a renewed weather outlook and attitude.The second half of the day was mostly sunny and the change in weather did wonders for our collective mood. We made quick work of the first 3 miles and stopped briefly at a road gap to rest and have a drink. We collectively bemoaned how little trail magic we had experienced in the last couple weeks and agreed that the terrible weather was mostly to blame. Surely we will see sunnier days ahead along with more trail angels dispensing freebies. I was the first of us to roll into Clyde smith shelter and I quickly pulls out my wet gear again to take advantage of the sunny late afternoon and warmer temps. Tab was already at the shelter and I chatted with bear box, French toast and preacher while waiting for the girls to get in. Eventually, we all got settled and dried and even got a campfire going despite the soaked wood laying around. I had been carrying two IPAs since Erwin that I wasn’t inclined to drink last night but gladly divested the weight down my gullet tonight. Temps are supposed to be cool but mild tonight and we are all finally dry (minus maybe the inside of my shoes).

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588703,"The moon was bright last night but I slept dry and soundly. Didn’t get out of camp til nearly 10 despite our goal of significant mileage. We knew we had to get over Roan Mt and several balds before we would make it to the overland mountain shelter tonight. Just as we were approaching the road gap before the climb up Roan, we spotted a group set up with trail magic. The hiking gods must’ve heard our cries  yesterday and the response was strong. Silver Lining was a thru hiker from last year and he and his crew brought everything. I indulged on chocolate chip pancakes, hot dogs, cookies, candy, hummus and fresh veggies. Glow stick, ibex and I shot the shit with them for 45 minutes and had to pull ourselves away eventually. They insisted we take anything we wanted for the trail so I grabbed more cookies and candy and we left with a Coors banquet apiece to enjoy atop Roan. The nearly 5 mile climb up was steady but not grueling and the dense pine forest provided nice cover against the rising temperature. I topped out first at the grassy clearing that once held the Cloudland Hotel. It was built in the late 1800s and lasted only a few decades before shutting down. All that is left are a couple crumbling walls and the old stone fire place that now sits quietly in the dense pines right on the trail. The three of us enjoyed our beers in the sun before we lit out again.
No sooner had we scurried down to the next road gap that we found yet another trail magic bonanza. “Hiker!” the group yelled to me as I started across the parking lot. I raised a trekking pole in greeting as I approached and found another massive spread of free goodies. A burger, cole slaw, fresh veggies and cold Coors light were all there for the taking and we again sat with a crew of former thru hikers from last year and swapped stories and solicited advice. I learned once again that the White Range in NH is going to kick my ass completely. It was doubly difficult to get myself moving again but we still had 5.5 miles to the shelter and it was now past 5pm. I stuffed a couple Rice Krispie treats in my pack and started the climb up over the next three balds. The hiking was good and the weather was still fine so no problem getting in a little later than usual. I passed a group on my way down into the valley that I later dubbed the Denim Parade. A group of about a dozen college aged kids were staggered along the trail, struggling to get up to the balds. No fewer than 9 of them wore blue jeans and they had clunky gear awkwardly strapped to the outside of their packs. I gathered these were not thru hikers. They were all friendly enough if not totally confused about where the hell they were actually going to camp that night. I bid them good luck and continued on until I finally got to overmountain around 7. 
This is one of the cooler shelters on the entire AT as it used to be a barn but has been converted for thru hikers to sleep in. You could probably fit 50 people in this thing if you had to. As usual, I opted to tent instead out on the flat grass that looks down valley. It will be a full moon tonight and despite predicted cold temps and wind, it’s too beautiful not to be outside. We ate only snack food for dinner as we were all still stuffed from the killer trail magic feasts and I even helped Bear Box polish off an extra pbr that she had carried out but didn’t want. Today was a very good day on the trail and tomorrow we will head into Roan Mt, TN for an overnight at mountain harbor hostel.","Clyde Smith Shelter

On my way up the first rise, I noticed a sign that described a revolutionary war battle that took place on this site. Cool. The hiking was decent this morning, lots of mud and standing water on the trail and the false summits going up Hump Mt were frustrating but all in all good. The sun is still shining and the weather forecast is similar this week until we hopefully get into Damascus.I made the road gap and walked the .3 miles to the hostel where I checked in and grabbed an iced coffee from the fridge and waited outside on the picnic table for the girls. Just as ibex showed up, a section hiker who was leaving sat down some cold beers for us to have. I delayed in taking a shower or doing laundry while I drank outside in the sun. What are Sundays for anyway? Eventually I took care of the menial tasks and also grabbed a bbq chicken sandwich and chili dog from the food truck out front. Fantastic. Later we shuttled over to the Ingles for a minor resupply (granola for breakfast, I can’t do any more pop tarts for a while) and also was able to pick up a six pack of beer. We drank and ate again outside and our Finnish friends, alma and snickers rolled in. They joined us for a couple drinks and then a couple more and before we knew it, it was past our bedtime.

The terrain was easy and the sun was out, couldn’t have been happier to be back on the trail. Passed through some high meadows and dropped back into the woods before arriving at Jones Falls. A truly impressive cascade that started probably 150 feet higher in the woods before spilling down with impressive force. We stopped for a snack break there and also took a couple photos to mark mile 400! We agreed to press up to Mountaineer Falls before breaking again and the next five miles flew by. Part of the section dropped down to the river and we ambled along with it for a mile or so before climbing back into the trees. We stopped again briefly to dip our feet in the water beneath mountaineer Falls which were probably only half as high but still cool as the trail passes right underneath them. Feeling strong, we decided we had enough energy to push another 8+ miles up to a campsite that would save us some climbing early tomorrow while still allowing us creek access for water. I zoned out to some music and was the first to arrive. Shortly after, ibex and glow stick rolled in and we set up and got dinner going. Shortly after we’d eaten, Tab showed up which was surprising considering he wasn’t really feeling energetic when we passed him earlier this morning.

This will necessitate a dry out later today somewhere. We had 10 miles or so to get to the side trail to Hampton this morning so we took an aggressive pace to get there. I had the last of my pop tarts for breakfast and as predicted, started to wane on energy after only a few miles. Stubbornly, I didn’t want to eat more because I knew lunch in town awaited. There were three fairly steep hill climbs before the terrain headed back down and by the time i was on the downslope, I was really dragging ass. Glow stick caught up to me and asked why I was moving so slow. It was a foot dragging march down to Laurel Fork Falls where we decided to break just a couple miles ahead of the Hampton trail. My knees were really singing as we descended the stone steps to the base of the falls. I felt much better after I dunked my head in the cold stream and sat down to have a snack while enjoying the view. The falls are a wide, stepped cascade that flows with an impressive force. After about a half hour we rallied again to get ourselves into town.The trail followed the creek through the canyon all the way to the side trail and for most of the mile before the trail pops out to the road near the town. From there, we walked a quick .3 miles down to Browns grocery and hardware where we were able to get cold drinks and resupply. Lou’s Good Eats was a food truck parked conveniently outside and I went for a pulled pork sandwich and fries. We ate in the hot sun in the parking lot and I decided an iced tea and ice cream bar would be a good idea while we waited for ibex to collect up her box from the post office. Glow stick and I found some shade on the side of the grocery store and I was able to call the broken fiddle hostel in Damascus to get a room for the three of us for Friday and Saturday for our next planned zero. After ibex finished I grabbed a Gatorade for the trail and we marched back to the junction of the side trail in the canyon where we had stashed our packs by the creek to run into town. As full as we were from rich town food, the nearly three mile climb up to our planned campsite was fairly brutal. I was burping every twenty paces or so but kept pushing on with some help from my iPod. We found a good flat tent site near the spring with 3 other hikers and enjoyed a campfire before turning in.

The shelter by the lake has been closed due to bear activity and the surrounding campsites have also reported issues with them. The morning descent to the lake was easy downhill and flew by. We passed several other thru hikers that were staying in hostels nearby and slackpacking southbound for the day. We stopped at the dam for a snack and decided to extend our day to a farther shelter as we had made good time and miles already. The climb away from the lake followed a paved road for about a half mile before climbing back into the woods and the next 5 miles was steady uphill. The day was sunny and pretty warm and I was sucking down water at a fast rate. We broke again at a spring for water and food and chatted with a couple other thru hikers, one we hadn’t met before (soup spot) and one who’d stayed in our camp last night (energizer). 
The remaining 8.5 miles was tough on my feet. I felt good until the next shelter but with 6+ to go, I was hurting. Have been experiencing a persistent pain in the bottom center of my left foot just below my toes. It’s something I’ve experienced in the past and I fear it has to do with my arch flattening as my feet spread from constant abuse. Will seek advice from outfitters in Damascus but not feeling good now.

Something much larger was shuffling around outside and I listened to it move from behind our tents to the hill up behind the shelter. Glow stick whispered from her tent to see if I was awake and hearing it too. I was. Could hear sizable branches breaking underfoot from up the hill and I shined my flashlight from under the vestibule up toward the shelter but could not see anything. We had all hung our bear bags up in that area so I have an idea of what the general attraction was. I listened to him explore around up there for probably another 30 minutes and his steps seemed to be getting fainter in the woods as i eventually drifted back to sleep. Nothing was disturbed in the morning so it seems we survived our first bear encounter. Kinda bummed I didn’t actually see him but not that disappointed. Ibex seemed pretty nonplussed about the whole thing and said she had only woken up because she heard glow stick and I talking. Such a cool customer that one.

Thunderbird was seated at the diner counter and we joined him. Apparently he just caught a shuttle in after experiencing some severe foot pain after leaving Erwin. No sooner had he cleared an antibiotic treatment for open blisters than he got a new pain starting up. He saw an outfitter and got some insoles and will take a couple more days off before getting out again. The trail can be frustrating sometimes, throwing multiple ailments at you in quick succession.
I thoroughly enjoyed a meatloaf sandwich with fries and a house salad and we then went by the post office to pick up packages. My aunt Donette had baked a shoebox full of peanut butter and chocolate chip cookies so we would be set on baked goods for the coming week. We then headed up to the broken fiddle hostel and checked in, sort of. Some hostels on the trail are more laissez-faire than others but this one takes the cake. We wound up doing our own bedding laundry so that we would have clean linens for the night but not before washing our own clothes. You never really know what to expect with these places but the people there were nice enough and the plumbing worked so nothing too major to complain about. There is a coffee shop/cafe down the street called mojos so we took the opportunity to grab an iced coffee (and maybe a couple beers). Thunderbird was down there too so we all sat together at the bar and caught up on the game of who’s where on the trail these days.
We knew the brewery opened at 6 so we timed our walk to the other end of town to arrive there at the appropriate hour, stopping by the outfitters on the way. I talked with Jeff at Mt Rogers and he almost immediately recognized my foot problem and recommended some inserts that would help keep my arch supported. My original insoles have taken close to 500 miles worth of beating and that’s when they typically go to hell. I can already feel my arch being pushed up which is a little sore but the pressure point in the middle of my foot isn’t sharply painful with every step. It’ll take a day or two to know for sure if this is going to make my foot feel better but I’m pretty confident that it will start to improve.
We left the main drag and walked the rest of the mile down around the bend to the brewery. They poured a mean mango sour and that would be the beer of choice for most of the evening. We chatted with some other hikers that had just gotten in (smoke, butcher, Floyd) and listened to some pretty awful local musicians who were trying their best on open mic night. Super nice old boys who had fun chatting up the crowd between tunes but not a passable singer among them. After a while, ibex handed me her phone and told me to give Head chef directions to the brewery as he’d just walked in to town! He was able to hitch down and within moments we were celebrating a tramily reunion. We capped it off by ordering some pizzas from across the street and when the brewery closed, we hitched a ride back to the hostel with a local who we’d been talking with most of the night. There was a crew out on the back patio when we got back so I sat out there and had a beer and bourbon before finally calling it a night. We will zero here tomorrow and try to take care of some of our trail needs before getting back out on Sunday.","Abingdon Gap Shelter

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589768,"Somehow I was one of the first ones up this morning in the house and I took the opportunity to grab a shower while there was still plenty of hot water. There was a pot of coffee on and only a couple of us up drinking it so I had a few cups. By the time the others were up and ready for breakfast, I was more than ready to get going. We returned to Damascus diner and had a super tasty breakfast. Double egg sandwich, hash brown casserole and French toast. We then poked around at sun dog outfitters for a few which is conveniently right next to mojos so of course we popped in for a drink. It’s cinco de mayo and derby day so I waited until exactly 12:01 and had my first modelo. Floyd had joined the table and I persuaded him to drink one with me and then ibex and glowstick also partook. We still planned on a return visit to the brewery so a power nap back at the hostel was also in the cards.
 We again timed our departure for around 6 and this time were able to thumb a ride from a local who dropped us at food city across from the brewery. We did a couple day resupply shop and got some snacks for the brewery before double timing it across the street to beat an impending rainstorm. It started coming down heavily right as we got in and we took the last table in the back and watched it pour while we drank and snacked dry. Another local band was inside tonight and they were actually pretty good. Younger guys that did mostly funky covers. The place was not packed at all and we went back for multiple rounds and ordered pizza again from across the street. We stayed to last call at 10 and then sauntered back into town. Pretty low key end to the night and we will get back out tomorrow but will take our time with breakfast first. Supposed to rain heavily again tonight and hopefully only early tomorrow before clearing off. Hope we can start out of town dry.","Damascus

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589770,"Check out was 10am but no one was around to collect money from us or get us squared away so we took our sweet time in getting organized before finally leaving our payment in the drop box out back along with a note to clarify the final bill. This felt like par for the course given the general absence of the staff during our stay. We then strolled down to mojos for one last town meal (huevos rancheros and a cinnamon roll). Once again, feeling overfull and lethargic we said goodbye to Damascus until trail days in 2 weeks and started the hike out of town.The terrain was a gradual but sustained climb and it was lightly raining for most of the afternoon. The miles went pretty quickly anyway and made quick work of the hills. Head Chef had opted to do his resupply shop just before leaving town and told us he’d catch up by the end of the day. When glow stick, ibex and I arrived at the intended campsite by a pond, we didn’t find it to be quite large enough for our potential four tent group. We did meet another Juke Box there who had just recently pulled up stakes from Ft Collins to come out to the trail. Small world. The three of us decided to do another mile and a half down to Laurel creek and set up there. We asked Juke box to convey the message to chef when he came through. We descended to the river side and found a nice little spot with a nice flat rock near the water that became our dinner spot. Chef hasn’t showed but we had a two day goal for the shelter at Grayson highlands so I’m sure we will see him tomorrow.","Damascus, VA

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590072,"We got our things together this morning and ate breakfast, again on the big flat rock by the creek. Chef didn’t make it down here last night but hopefully he will catch us today. We set out under grayish skies and hoped the day would clear as we went. The climb up the hill to the first shelter went fast and I stopped there to snack, use the privy and allow my tent to dry out for a few minutes after a lot of condensation by the creek last night. Glow stick and ibex caught up soon after as did Juke box before we all set out for whitetop mountain. We passed through a cow pasture before the real incline began and the
 hike up was gradual through a nice forest before finally opening up to a nice meadow and some good rock formations where we had 360 degree views of the surrounding mountains. I chatted with Juke box about people we might know in common from Ft Collins and we did know a few from Road 34. 
The afternoon terrain was breezy and mostly level around the backside of the mountain until dropping down to a road gap. Juke box was there just as a group with trail magic was leaving and he was good enough to give me some bagged pasta salad for dinner and a corona. When ibex showed up, she chatted with a couple that had more beer and our quick pit stop turned into an hour long hang in the grass by the parking lot. A ridge runner also chatted us up and gave us some updates on trail info ahead. 
Eventually we pulled ourselves up and crossed the road to begin the climb through the forest up to the shelter in the Grayson highlands. The sky was darkening and a rumble or two of thunder was going around. When I was one mile from the shelter, I came up on head Chef, easy and Juke box. They had met one of the wild ponies and were taking a few pics and chatting. The pony immediately came for my arm and started licking the salt from my sweat off of me. Amusing as this was, I didn’t want to chance getting caught in a thunderstorm so Chef and I made quick moves towards the shelter. The rain was starting and the thunder getting closer. We passed by the trail to the summit of Mt Rogers (highest point in VA) and half jogged to get up to the shelter just before the sky opened up. The rain came down hard for over an hour but the lightning and thunder left us alone. The down valley view from behind the shelter was incredible once the rain let up and I took my time waking down to get water from the spring so i could enjoy it. Ibex and I had decided that we would look for tent sites if the weather cleared before dark and we jumped at the opportunity to be camping with such an amazing view. Glow stick got FOMO and decided to grab her stuff out of the shelter and join us. 
We found some nice spots only a few hundred yards past the shelter and enjoyed our views for dinner. It was almost fully dark as we were finishing dishes and closing up our food bags. Glow stick had just gotten in her tent when she said, “Guys, what’s that sound?” I was fiddling with my food bag and lifted my head to answer when my headlamp lit up one of the wild ponies standing right in the middle of our camp! He didn’t care at all about us and was just calmly munching grass. It seemed strange to just crawl into bed with him there but he couldn’t be bothered to move so we decided to turn in. A few more have wandered in and out this evening as we are lying here. I’m fairly certain a pony has never killed a sleeping hiker.","Laurel Creek/creeper trail camp

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590083,"Our camp was alternating between sun and full fog as morning clouds passed quickly overhead. As soon as we started breaking camp, we had a visit from the ponies. This time a mother and her baby came right up and I couldn’t help but share some of my dried fruit. The baby(foal?) was a little shy but would still let you pet her if you approached carefully enough. The mother was all up in our faces for pets, licks, and any food we were willing to share. Easy walked down from his hammock site as we were entertaining ourselves and relayed that one of the ponies had gotten away with his food bag last night. His search this morning for any remnants was fruitless so he will have to head into town for resupply today. Head chef had slept in the Shelter last night and reported that one of the ponies had absconded with a shoe and gaiter this morning. Both items were recovered, albeit covered in slobber and well chewed. I needed to answer nature’s call before we left camp and I asked head chef to watch my pack for a minute. The ponies didn’t go after that but one of them snatched a trekking pole and started to scamper off. Head chef chased him down and by pretending to have food in his hand, was able to wrest my trekking pole away. It’s only mostly covered in slobber, chewed grass, and pony bite marks. Makes for a funny story, I guess.We hiked up and over the high rocks atop Grayson highlands and without seeing the stone marker, passed mile 500! The rest of the hike out of the park was rugged but really cool. The rock formations reminded me very much of the American West. The group took a quick lunch/gear dry break at the next shelter and then decided to push another 12 miles for the day. The terrain was pretty forgiving and went by smoothly. There was a nice view back across to the Grayson highlands from a hilltop below and then we were hiking back up into a forest. I stopped once more at the following shelter to fuel up for the remaining five miles as my feet were starting to feel it. I also discovered that Red Hot Chili Peppers might be the best hiking music yet. The end of the day was mostly downhill and about a mile and a half past the next shelter, we found our little camp. There were a few decent flat spots next to the creek but about 6 more hikers showed before evening. They had less desirable spots but everyone settled in. We all chatted around the fire during and after dinner and I turned in not long after hiker midnight.","Thomas Knob Shelter

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590090,"Did the morning routine slowly and was second to last out of camp today. After only about 3-4 miles, we came across some trail magic in the thick rhododendrons just below a road gap. Daypack, who has hiked the trail 4 times and will attempt his fifth next year was running more food and drink from his car to the coolers. I snagged a monster coffee energy drink and a small kit Kat for later. I felt the surge of the caffeine and powered up the next hill. We descended again and when we got to the next shelter path, opted to snack there instead of walk the scant distance down. Chef had finished his lunch and was coming up the path to get back on the trail and we followed suit a few moments later. With just under 10 miles to partnership Shelter, we moved with purpose as the promise of delivery pizza and shower awaited there. The miles were good but I made the crucial mistake of not watering up before a long dry stretch and had to ration water for about 8 miles to end the day. I was thrilled to arrive at the shelter and find the shower was in working order. There is a visitor center around the corner so we get to steal some of their plumbing which is fantastic. I also took the opportunity to do some hobo laundry in the sink out back and should be able to line dry everything before we leave tomorrow. After the others had arrived and gotten settled, we were able to order delivery to the visitor center from a local pizza joint. Chicken Parm sandwich, bbq wings and a salad for me. Ate way too much and also had a beer gifted by a fellow camper. Fat and happy tonight and will pop into Marion tomorrow to resupply and pick up packages.","Stealth camp below hurricane shelter

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591020,"We got ourselves moving early so that we would be able to catch the Marion town shuttle that picks up at the visitor center nearby. Everyone needs at least some resupply and I am also expecting two packages at the post office. Daypack, who was our trail angel yesterday, returned to the shelter this morning with all kinds of breakfast foods so we had something to eat before we left. We killed a few minutes inside the visitor center admiring the hellbender salamander they had in an aquarium as well as weighing ourselves on their scale. I’m coming in at 180 now which means I’ve dropped nearly 30 pounds so far. Yikes.
The others hopped off the shuttle at Walmart and I stayed on to hit the post office. I took the time to update some daily blog entries while low-key eavesdropping on some local’s conversations. My packages had both arrived (thanks to mad dog and val and my folks) and I waited a couple minutes before the shuttle returned to pick me up on its hourly circuit. By the time I’d sorted through the bountiful goods sent by my friends and family, it was clear I didn’t need much at all from the grocery store. I grabbed just a couple items and scarfed a chicken salad sandwich from the deli before hopping back on the shuttle to the visitor’s center. It took another 45 minutes back at the shelter to get laundry off the line and sort our food bags and we eventually headed back out. 
The trail was a lot of up and down with a couple decent climbs that had me sweating. I stopped at the first shelter to snack and reconvene with the others. We all agreed to meet at the Atkins road gap for dinner at either the Barn or the Mexican restaurant across the street. As I was about 3 miles from there, I came across a church group handing out trail magic from inside an old schoolhouse. I had a cold soda and thanked them just as they were finishing up and leaving. The trail from here was a pleasant stroll mostly through grassy meadows. When I arrived at the highway intersection, I popped into the barn first where Head chef and thunderbird were already seated. I quickly ate a bbq pork and slaw sandwich with an iced tea before cruising across the street to meet ibex at the Mexican restaurant. Soon after, glow stick, Juke box, head chef and thunderbird all made their way in and we started second dinner. Just as we had been served, the sky opened up and it poured rain for close to an hour. We were all content to sit and watch from inside as we only had a mile and a half left to go to camp. We also bought beers for the road from the adjoining gas station and packed them out. The hike up to our camp was cool and pleasant and we passed through a large cow pasture with gorgeous views before arriving. We sat around and did a slightly preemptive cheers for the 25% mark (tomorrow) and I saw fireflies for the first time in my life which feels both cool and slightly tragic. We also popped up to the meadow just before turning in to see a few shooting stars. Another great day to be on the trail.","Partnership Shelter

Quite a few steep climbs throughout the day and the capper would be a particularly grueling 6 mile uphill stretch. Nah. We took our time leaving camp and I distributed more of moms cookie bars to my crew in hopes of lightening my pack a bit. The day was challenging but not overly so and we had made about 12 miles before it started to rain a bit. At the next shelter, we decided to find a camp site soon because the forecast looked like rain coming sooner than later. We decided on a slightly pitched tentsite near a good creek and set up and whipped up dinner. I opted to heat up one of the dehydrated dinners from my folks. Can’t say I loved it, a ton of sodium and just kinda bland in general. They do pack a good calorie and protein punch but for the money and bulk, I don’t think I’ll be looking to add any to my meal regimen. We had a little fire and decided we would take a couple smaller nearo days tomorrow and the next. We feel like the rest could be good and we don’t need to stop in town for anything for a few days.

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591729,"Heard some definite large mammal activity around camp last night and had something very large brush against the back of my rainfly around 2am. I didn’t see him though, as he stayed out of my line of sight behind my tent until presumably continuing on to the field to the right. I was pretty exhausted after a long day of hiking and passed back out almost immediately. Everyone in camp had heard the noises and the consensus was bears. We weren’t in a great hurry after our big day and we planned to stop at Trent’s grocery off the trail for lunch as well as hit Dismal Falls for a bit in the afernoon. The hike in the morning was a pretty easy 6 miles and it was sunny but not too warm. The trail dipped down and over a cool wooden suspension bridge over a creek just before crossing a road. From there, we hoofed it left for a half mile to Trent’s for lunch. It was basically a gas station with a small grill kitchen but we were all thrilled at the prospect of greasy burgers and cold drinks and ice cream. A particularly colorful yokel whom I’ve since named Merle, chatted us up throughout lunch and offered us insightful opinions about our various places of origin as well as some very informed thoughts about the dangers of volcanic activity as it pertains to global warming. He also gave Audrey the best nickname we’d heard: Tina Turner Legs. I think Merle should be in charge of naming all thru hikers from now on.After lunch, we split back down the road and made the less than 2 mile climb up to dismal falls. It was still just sunny enough to be in the water so we got down to swim wear and jumped off the lower part of the falls into the shallow pool below. As the clouds gathered quickly, we made a last minute decision to set up camp here for the night and make up the miles tomorrow. We still have the same schedule to get into pearisburg on Thursday and we liked it here. We also liked that Trent’s grocery was accessible by a side road that was less than a mile down. Beer anyone? Chef, Juke box and I hitched down with some locals and filled my empty pack up and ran into the Fins while down there. We told them to head up there when they finished eating and camp with us. We walked the mile back up to the falls and crossed the creek back into camp where the girls were waiting. We drank and got a huge fire going despite the light but consistent rain throughout the night. We made it almost to midnight before turning in.

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591722,"Was moving a little slow this morning, partially because of the cloudy, wet weather and partially from beers consumed last night. The general sluggishness translated to the trail as I didn’t feel very good energy despite easy terrain. It was raining lightly most of the morning and by the time I hit the first shelter after 7 miles, I was ready to eat. I snacked voraciously and also made hot cocoa as the others rolled in. We got to talking about the expected rain in the forecast and at the same time, I started finding some interesting things about the Woods Hole hostel on my trail apps. Another hiker, one foot, who was lunching at the shelter also had just stayed there and raved about it. I had Ibex and glow stick on board almost immediately but chef and Juke box were non committal. Chef was understandably reluctant as we would be off the trail for two days this weekend for Trail Days. We would still do the same mileage getting into pearisburg before the end of tomorrow so he agreed that hostel bed was better than wet tent. 
It was only another 7.5 miles there so we hustled up the next steep ridge climb to call them and get a reservation. Glow stick was able to get us four bunks and Juke box said he’d walk down with us and decide when he got there. We trudged through a steady rain to get there and of course it lightened up as we walked up to the house. Woods Hole is a working farm on 100 acres of land and it’s absolutely fantastic. Neville, the owner welcomed us and showed us around and also made the most incredible strawberry banana smoothie (really a milkshake) that I’ve ever tasted. We signed up for dinner and breakfast and settled our things and also enjoyed one of the cleanest, hottest showers on the trail yet. Loaner clothes too as we decided to combine a few items each into a laundry load. As a few more hikers arrived, Neville enlisted me to see who else on the property would like a smoothie and then had me help Blue in the kitchen start prepping dinner. I rinsed and chopped heaping pounds of fresh greens that had just been pulled from the garden. Chef popped in to help her stir fry the steak and I continued setting up tables and glasses and then mixing salad dressing. Everyone gathered in the yard before dinner to share a thought of gratitude. I realize how New age, hippy dippy that all sounds but this place is really great. And dinner was amazing. Huge salad, fresh baked bread, and home made stir fry. For dessert, home made ice cream cones. None of us have even an ounce of regret for having stopped here. Even Juke box opted to treat himself to the loft room for the evening. We all played Yahtzee after dinner and snickers joined us. Ibex, who had never played before benefitted from our overly proficient coaching and won. It’s raining pretty hard now as we wind down, so yeah, totally made the right call on this one.","Dismal Falls campsite

I made my way up to the main house where coffee (they roast their own beans) was being served on the porch and had 2 cups. We all convened on the lawn for the pre-meal gratitude ritual and then I helped set up tables and settings for everyone. Breakfast was amazing and consisted of fresh bread, cheesy grits, veggie eggs, and fruit. Fresh food is unbeatable. We finished our plates and got organized before heading out into a slightly rainy morning. With 11+ miles to cover before Pearisburg, we wasted no time and got down the trail. The weather mostly cooperated until we started up a ridge climb and the sky opened up. I could see blue skies in either direction but directly above us and in front of us was a dark, heavy cloud. It poured for about 45 minutes before easing up and it was just in time for us to catch an amazing view in some cliffs overlooking Pearisburg. We enjoyed a quick snack break but didn’t hang out too long when we spotted another cloud coming our way. We motored down the remaining 3 miles and found the road crossing that led down into town. As we arrived at Dairy Queen, glow stick spotted her friend David who had cone to pick us up. We ate a quick dq snack and said farewell to Juke box and the Fins who were getting a lift into Damascus tonight. We piled into David’s car for the short drive out to Blacksburg. Once there, we stopped by the grocery store for beer and marveled at what a nice, normal town it was. Hadn’t seen such modernity in a city probably since starting tge trail. It felt odd being amongst mini malls and Starbucks again. David took us out to his house which he shared with some other grad students and it had the unmistakable feel of a college crash pad. The shower was hot though and he let us do laundry so we were happy. After a couple beers on his back porch, we headed out for Thai food and ate ravenously as we do. We then toured through the Virginia tech campus and popped over to his favorite local pub. We spent a couple hours drinking pints and throwing darts well past our normal hiker bedtime. Finally, we hit the late night pizza joint where I ordered 2 giant slices of pepperoni and killed a 12 oz container of coffee ice cream.

Swamp (Swamp Fuck, actually) showed a bit after 9 and we thanked David once again and piled into our sedan chariot for the 1 hour 45 minute haul to Damascus. We all swapped trail stories and I began to notice my knees were really throbbing today. By the time we finally got to Damascus, they were absolutely screaming. Not good. The trail obviously puts a great deal of strain on many areas of the body and I have had issues with knee pain in the past. Years of skiing and hiking will do that. Regardless, it’s concerning that I can’t be in a seated position comfortably for more than 30 minutes before they start singing. May need to look into preventative measures or get more proactive about stretching and working the tightness out. Anyway....
We rolled into tent city and almost immediately ran into Juke box. He is one of those people that you inevitably see everywhere so that made sense. He gave us the lowdown on where to tent and we walked back to the forest off to the left and found a suitable spot about a quarter of a mile in. By suitable, I mean fairly rocky, totally saturated, and surrounded by tall weeds. We set up as best we could knowing that the rain would be coming down on our tents all weekend. Being fairly dry at the moment, we decided to walk out to the park where most of the vendor tents were set up and also get to the post office where ibex and I both had things to pick up. The walk through town was a moving reunion of hikers we hadn’t seen in weeks and it was really fun seeing everyone. There was katie and Francis that I hadn’t seen since day 2 and were instrumental in me adopting my trail name. Matt and Naps who we hadn’t seen since Hiawassee. Rebel Yell not seen since Gatlinburg. We almost didn’t make the post office in time for closing because we were catching up with everyone. I got a great care package from uncle Joe and aunt Andi (thanks guys!) and some important items from Amazon: a merino tank top for the warm weather, a case of indomie noodles, and a small case of glow sticks. Glow stick wanted the glow sticks because she thinks this is a music festival and not the hobo convention that it actually is. We also bought beer at the dollar general for fear that they might be bought out completely by the end of the night. 
We spent the remainder of the night bouncing around the various party sites in tent city and also hid from the rain for at least an hour under the clean water tent. After the sun went down we finally found original Juke box and Girl Scout. So good to see them after weeks apart, our tramily was reunited! Juke box and Juke box 2.0 agreed not to battle to the death and instead decided to collaborate. I’m skeptical, though. In the end there can be only one Juke box. We all then cruised through the slopping mud over to the big bonfire near the wonderland and Riff Raff tent sites. Despite the hard rain, we stayed and drank until after 1am. Finally, I cruised back to our tents and I crawled in for some sleep. Hopefully not too soggy.","Blacksburg VA

I emptied out my backpack so that I could hand it over to the osprey dolks for alteration but I threw in all the dirty clothes that I wanted to give to the One Way folks for a free wash. After I’d dropped those off, I went over to the one Way ministry building and got a free haircut. Barber from Erwin was there and he cleaned up my Mohawk and gave me an AT line on the side of my head. When I got back to camp, Chef was stirring so we walked over to mojos and got some food. Juke box, glow stick and Andrea were there so we hung out for a bit and I ran over to the community pool for a free shower to get all the hair clippings washed out. When I got back to mojos, the hiker parade was congregating and hikers from this year and years passed started the march down Laurel Street. We opted not to arbitrarily march a mile and a half because we’re just to cool for that. And we are all hobbling like old people right now. We hung out there for a bit, had a drink or two and eventually drifted back towards camp. I picked up my pack from osprey and they’d done well, my hip belt was smaller and my tears had been sewn up.

We collectively suffered the less than 8 mile hike to the shelter and fought through our hangovers to get here. I dried out my tent on a tree and went out to the field to drink a tall boy I had packed out and make a call home to mad dog and val. The sunset that followed from up there was one of the best yet. Everyone from camp came out to watch and enjoy. Head chef had packed out a 5 pound chicken from town and enlisted me to help finish it. I obliged and added an entire thigh to my bbq chicken indomie noodles. Delicious. Looking for bigger miles tomorrow, hopefully 20+","Damascus VA

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591513,"Got out of camp at ten til nine this morning just behind Chef but ahead of the girls. Grabbed one last peek of the amazing valley view which was a sea of low white clouds this morning. The terrain was pretty nice this morning, soft rolling atop the ridge line. Despite the forgiving terrain, I still felt like I was dragging ass quite a bit, probably still sapped from the weekend. Knowing we were shooting for a twenty miler, I kept my head down and marched on. I met chef down by pine branch stream after 12 miles and we lunched and waited on the ladies. They arrived and just before we were all finished lunching, the thunder started up and it began to sprinkle. With 8+ miles of mostly uphill to go, we got back underway now with rain covers on our packs. The rain persisted for a few hours this afternoon and there is water everywhere. The streams, creeks, and rivers are all swollen and running with force and even the trail has been intermittently turning into a stream. The afternoon was hard earned and thankfully the rain eased up as we got closer to camp. The final 4 miles was uphill over big slick rocks and through mud, standing and moving water. Not ideal trail conditions but we arrived to Wind Rock at 7 and set up before walking up to the view spot to cook dinner. Chef and I both cooked a double package of Indomie noodles and chatted with Wilt, a girl that we recognized from somewhere earlier on the trail who also started hiking the same day that I did. Ibex and glow stick arrived closer to sunset and were slightly grumpy after the strenuous day but perked up slightly after some indomie of their own. Everyone is pretty beat and in tents by 9pm. Shooting for a 16 miler tomorrow.","Rice Field Shelter

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591723,"It rained periodically last night, enough that my tent was wet outside and humid enough that the inside was caked in condensation. The sun was shining through mixed clouds and there was a slight breeze so that when I took my tent up to the point on Wind Rock and held it up to the breeze, it had fully dried within 5 minutes. Love that lightweight design on days when I can actually get it out to dry. The group had breakfast up there near the viewpoint and enjoyed the sun hoping it would last through most of the day. We broke camp and agreed to meet at a shelter about 10 miles in to break for lunch. We actually all convened earlier at the first shelter for snack/privy break. I took the opportunity in the dry day to super glue my trail runners in a few spots where they are staring to show wear and develop small holes. I don’t know if these will last to the halfway mark but they have done nearly a third of the trail so far which is great. I do know you shouldn’t super glue a hole in your shoe with your socked foot inside it. Super glue on the sock is gonna be tough to get out. 
The climb from here to the lunch shelter kinda kicked my ass and I wonder if I need to look closer at what I’m eating/snacking in the morning. I’ve noticed myself bonking early in the day recently and need to figure that out. Lunch was uneventful and we saw the weather had pushed the rain back from earlier to a 4-8pm range. Great. Just before 5 as I was walking through a pasture, it started dumping. I got drenched for about 45 minutes before it started breaking up. The group caught up and we watered up before our 2 mile climb up to camp. We passed the Keffer oak, the second oldest (or largest?) tree on the trail. It was a big damn tree. The final mile up was just that, it felt vertical and I was sweating like a fiend. We passed sunshine and captain who had made camp at the first opportunity atop the ridge. We pushed on another to our site after half a mile. Sonic was there and we all set up and got our dinner going and had a small fire. Should be clearing weather tonight and mostly sunny for the next three days.","Wind Rock camp

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591724,"The only weather that bothered me last night was a bit of wind right before dawn. We all did our standard routine getting ready and just before we left, workhorse showed up. Haven’t seen him since we first were in Damascus and we chatted with him about everyone we had seen at trail days. Left camp sometime after 9 and hiked pretty swiftly past some very old cairns built by early settlers in the woods on the ridge. Kinda strange. The terrain also led along some slanted rock ledges for about a mile, offering some nice views across the valley. The weather was fine and the forecast looked good today. After about 8 miles, I came up on chef and sunshine having lunch by the creek near a road crossing. I joined them and chef and I discussed our plan of attack for resupply/zero/rain dodging for the next few days. Ibex and glow stick showed as we were getting ready to head out and opted to head another half mile up to lunch somewhere sunnier. I started the climb back up and kept a decent pace for the next 3.5 miles to the top of the ridge. Sunshine and I diverted briefly at the top to check out the Audie Murphy monument off a short side trail. The rest of the trail back down to camp was pretty good and went quickly. The camp near the county road and creek is pretty spacious and eventually we had about 8 tents and a couple hammocks. Everyone did their dinner thing and we all figured out how we’d make it to Daleville without starving. We have plans to hit a restaurant off trail called the Home Place. Apparently one of the best on the AT, it’s all you can eat family style southern and on thursdays they do bbq meats.

We had to get over dragons tooth today and into Catawba for the can’t-miss restaurant, the Home Place and then still hike out a few miles to camp. Hiked strong and felt energized ascending the ridge to Dragons Tooth. It was a sunny morning and I had a big dinner to look forward to. Arrived at the Tooth around 11 and did the scramble up to the top. It offered some gorgeous green valley views and if I held my phone 2 feet above my head, I got 2 bars of 4G service. T-Mobile seriously sucks out here. After everyone had done their quick climb up, we had a light lunch as we anticipated a gut busting dinner. The next 8+ miles to the road crossing went pretty quickly as we were properly motivated by the standard animalistic hunger. Glow stick had opted not to hit the restaurant (our resident veggie head) and instead diverted to the grocery store and would meet us later at camp.Ibex, Head chef and I made it down to the road crossing at 3:30 and the restaurant opened at 4. We debated walking the mile plus and almost gave up on hitching just before we caught a ride. We were dropped off about 15 minutes til open and found Sunshine and Rocket already waiting out on the porch. We felt like the crowd outside willie wonkas chocolate factory waiting for those doors to open, the suspense was terrible. Immediately at 4pm, we hopped inside and scored a table for 5. The waitress brought our drinks and we opted to have the fried chicken and pulled pork. They rolled out everything family style and it was all-you-can-eat. Sides of coleslaw, mash potatoes and gravy, green beans, pinto beans, cinnamon apples, and biscuits with apple butter soon cluttered the table. We ordered 3 rounds of most items and were nearly silent as we went to town. It was as good as advertised and we capped it off with blueberry cobbler and ice cream. It can hardly be hyperbole for me to say it was the best $15 I ever spent. We went outside to the enormous lawn of this beautiful early 20th century farm estate and promptly laid down in the grass to nap in true hiker trash form. Families arriving for dinner regarded us with something in between amusement and disgust. We were able to score another hitch out of the restaurant from a lovely couple with a huge van with plenty of room for all five of us. From the trailhead, we hiked a decent 2 miles up to the campsite by the shelter where glow stick was waiting. We had brought her a to-go order of cobbler.

Juke box had gotten in late last night and strolled in to our camp as we were getting ready to roll out. We climbed in near dark to the top of the ridge and arrived at McAffee just before sunrise. We took a few minutes to get the obligatory photos and then settled in to watch the sun come up. Well worth the early alarm clock and plenty of other hikers thought so too. After about an hour, we decided to rally and start the hike over to tinker cliffs about 4 miles away. The trail was generally good and rolling with a few steep uphill pitches leading up to the ridge for Tinker Cliffs. I misinterpreted the signage for the correct route and wound up hiking on a phantom path at the base of the cliffs. I stubbornly followed this false route for a few minutes before realizing my error and instead of turning around, I looked for a place to scramble up the cliffs. I found a narrow crevice that led up to some wider ledges that I thought I would be able to scramble up. The rock was in complete shade and still slick with rainwater. After a moment of contemplating how to remove my pack and drag it across the ledge, I came to my senses and decided to descend and backtrack. I lost a good 20 minutes but I also didn’t plummet to my death. I caught up with most of the crew at the top of the cliffs and enjoyed the view with a quick lunch. I had 11 miles between there and town food and I decided to high tail down the trail to Daleville.  The terrain was mostly downhill and generally good and I made quick time. When I rolled in to town, I went straight down to bojangles chicken to meet Chef. Combo meal and a side sandwich later and I was happy. Grabbed an espresso milkshake from the coffee place next door and was now in food coma heaven. The next stop was 3 Little Pigs bbq and I was so full that all I could do was drink beer. After everyone had filtered into town, we made a plan to uber out to flying mouse brewery. Ibex had confirmed with them last night that they allow camping on their property. We got dropped off 11 minutes after 8, when the brewery was supposed to close. They graciously sold us two six packs and told us we were free to set up our tents. What a country! Hoping for 16ish miles of slackpacking (hiking a section of trail without full backpack) tomorrow.

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592538,"We awoke at 6:30 to get a jump on our day and so that we could get our hiking miles in before the afternoon rain. Glow stick had gotten an Uber from town after we turned in and set up her tent late night. Sunshine had also camped with us on the brewery grounds and the 5 of us started the mile and a half hike back to town. The plan was to (hopefully) check in early at the super 8 and then day pack a 16 mile section of trail north before getting a shuttle back to town. Super 8 was able to let us get in the room early and I went up to unburden my pack of the majority of its weight and strip it down to just the necessities, water, snacks, filter, jacket. When the others came in, ibex said she had gotten the shuttle driver to drive us up to the road gap this morning and then we could hike the 16 miles back into town, rather than wait for him to puck us up when we had finished. Perfect. Now we could all hike at our own pace and arrive back in town as we finished. Chef and I loved this because we wanted to do quick miles today and that’s just what we did. By the time I caught up to him filtering water early in the day, I saw that we had already done nearly 6 miles. The rest of the day was equally fast and I listened to a couple playlists and made fast time. Before I knew it, I was crossing the roads just outside of Daleville and popped back out at the gas station next to our hotel. I went in and bought a six pack of fresh squeezed IPA and headed back to the room where chef had just hopped out of the shower. I took one myself and immensely enjoyed the hot water, though maybe not as much as I would have if I had gotten rained on this afternoon. Chef and I hung in the room for a short while before we decided to hit Panchos next door. It was one of the better Mexican places I’ve tried out here but still wasn’t what I’d call good. Still searching for that great Mexican food experience on the trail. After we were done, glow stick was walking back in from the trail and ibex not long after. We mostly just lounged in the room, I drinking on several beers and the girls decided to take a walk down the road to Kroger for wine and snacks. They also resolved to get fruit, syrup, and whipped cream for the Belgian waffles tomorrow morning. I opted to take a quick dip out in the pool before it closed just to stretch sore muscles and then followed that up with another amazing hot shower. None of us is motivated enough to go out to the breweries tonight so we will save that for our zero tomorrow. Not a bad day of slackpacking/town life, I could do this more often.","Harvey’s Knob

We set out the fruit, organic syrup, and whipped cream on our table and took turns making our Belgian waffles. They were delicious and gone quickly. The whipped cream was tapped, the syrup nearly gone and only a few straggler berries remained. Apparently we wouldn’t have enough fixings to repeat this tomorrow, such is the wrath of hungry hikers. We then decided to hit the pool for a bit. The menacing rain that was promised today seemed to have been pushed back so we thought it might be nice to get some rays. The four of us dipped and sunned and after a bit, Juke box rolls in with some cold beers in tow. We decided this could be a good hangout for a while, so I went and grabbed 12 more Yeunglings at the gas station and we enjoyed ourselves while the sun lasted. The clouds did finally convene and chase us inside but we were all getting hungry and eager to check out the Ballast Point brewery. We hopped an Uber (such a novelty to have that at my fingertips again) and were off. Chef opted to relax at the super 8 so Juke, ibex, glow and I rallied and went through multiple flight rounds. The brewery was an amazing space on beautiful grounds and the beer was fantastic. Also enjoyed most everything on the menu but the star for me was the butterscotch Budino pudding. Everyone cracked on me for ordering an old man dessert and then promptly shut their mouths once they tasted it. We finished up, paid our inflated tabs and ubered back to the hotel.

Had a couple bowls of cereal and a hard boiled egg along with coffee and oj. No waffle for me this morning as we had no more whipped cream and that was a deal breaker. I got back up to the room and enjoyed one more shower before getting my gear together. We had reached out to Homer for a shuttle and planned to have him pick us up from Kroger just after noon so that we could resupply there. I grabbed what I needed and then hit the coffee shop for another espresso milkshake and a turkey Reuben to go. I wrestled my once more obese food bag into my pack and hopped in the van to get back to the trailhead from the point we’d left it on Saturday. When we got up to the lot where the trail started, we all sat down on the ground for a few minutes. No one was super motivated but eventually we all picked ourselves up and got going. 
The hiking was good and pretty level, the weather was super cloudy and felt like it was just seconds away from pouring but for the duration of the hike, it did not. We got down to the creek by the road crossing where we had agreed to camp after just over 12 miles. We wound up setting up on opposite sides of the creek as chef had already set up in the trees on the other side, while glow stick and I preferred being closer to the creek on the near side albeit in a smaller campsite. Ibex joined us and Juke box opted to tent on the other side in favor of a more spacious area. He worries that his snoring keeps people up
and always tries to keep a buffer between himself and other tents. We all convened at their camp for dinner and chef had a fire going (primarily to cook the kielbasa he had packed out).

We broke down and set out one by one, I left last, a little after 9. The day was going to consist of steady climbing and I was in no great rush. I plugged along for a while until I came up behind Workhorse. He and I chatted for a little while about our reasons to do the trail and as many conversations do, we started talking about the weather. He let me know that the forecast from this morning had us getting plastered with heavy rain for the next 48 hours beginning tonight. The remnants of the tropical storm in Florida are supposedly sending some heavy bands of moisture north. Not exactly what I wanted to hear after just taking a zero. We have the opportunity to hide from the weather in a hostel tomorrow in Glasgow but the group has decided we are better off gutting it out to Buena vista on Thursday and posting up there for a night if necessary. We are all already hiding from the rain in our tents at 7:45 tonight and it seems fairly certain that the next two days are going to suck.

We had decided on 21 miles today, if the weather is going to be miserable, we might as well be hiking. I felt kinda low as I started the day. Was able to grind out the first 9 miles before lunch and took a decent break down at the first shelter with the others. Juke box decided he wasn’t up for the big miles today and resolved to get a shuttle into Buena vista to wait out the storm. I marched through the afternoon and kept a decent pace despite the intermittent torrent of rain. We met a trail maintainer with gatorades and fruit down by the Foot bridge at the James river. He informed us that this has been the wettest May on record for Roanoke. The final 10 miles were a bit of a struggle and one particularly nasty wave of rain had me a little worried up on a ridge but I squished into camp sometime after 6 and claimed what seemed to be the last shelter spot. My tent is too soaked to dry out in the rain cloud I’m currently living in so I’ll call this good for the night.

Ibex came by around 7:45am to wish me a happy birthday and give me a couple shooters and a package of red vines that they had gotten me. She also informed me that glow stick had been up vomiting and with diarrhea all night. She warned me that I might want to wash the Bday gifts since glow had been carrying them and then promptly went off to wash her hands. Despite the potential viral danger, I very much appreciated the thoughtful gifts. I just won’t be indulging them until I can get to soap and sink water. With glow sticks condition, it was a given now that we’d be staying in Buena Vista tonight, for her to hopefully recover and for all of us to dry out. We would be aiming for the Buena Vista motel and glow was able to hitch a ride in from the nearest road gap while chef, Ibex and I hiked down the 11ish miles to the standard road gap for the town. Once there, we accepted a hitch from a local named Jason who was in a bit of a turf war with another shuttler maned piney. Apparently Jason gave people free rides and piney charges folks so he gets a little raw when other people give free rides. At any rate, it was somewhat amusing listening to them gripe at each other for a few minutes before we headed down to town. 
We arrived at the motel and got Jason’s contact info for a return ride tomorrow, solid find and thanks to Jason. Ibex, chef and I opted to share a room with two doubles and promptly dirtied the room with all of our wet gear the moment we opened the door. We pulled everything out to dry before heading into town to grab food at the local Italian place. It was fantastic and we also chatted with the waitress Bella who offered to give us a ride back to the motel later if we ordered a pizza delivery. Good deal. We made a quick stop for ice cream and then made our way to the laundromat to get a load done. It rained like a bastard while we waited for our laundry and I felt vindicated in our decision to stay in town tonight. The parking lot of the laundromat turned into a pool before the downpour finally stopped and once our clothes were dry, we were able to walk back into town without getting wet. We made another stop at Don Tequilas and Chef ordered a round of Bday shots which turned into three rounds. We did a buzzed resupply at the dollar general and decided to just hoof it back to the motel rather than wait for Bella, the pizza girl to pick us up. We still ordered a pizza, though. I laid on the acceptably comfortable motel bed and drank a few beers, ate pizza and watched cable. It sounds like glow is feeling a bit better and she wants to get back on the trail tomorrow.

We talked about his attempts on Longs peak in CO, he has not successfully summited but has tried some of the more technical routes. We thanked him again and started our climb up away from the road gap. Our initial plan to get to Priest Shelter was shot in the face as soon as we realized it was 20 miles instead of 16. We wanted to make sure glow stick was fully recovered from yesterday’s illness so after we had taken a long rest in a meadow, we decided on a camp site that was another 5.5 miles out.

Perhaps it was the gloomy weather, but we all ate quietly and broke camp before heading off. The sky remained clouded and almost as if on schedule, it opened up about 5 minutes after noon. I was still nearly a mile away from the priest shelter when it hit and I silently cursed myself for having slowed down for a half mile earlier to chat with Marmot, a hiker who had been slowed down by injury back near Fontana Dam but was still trucking. That’ll teach me to be social. I was drenched when I got to the shelter and found Head chef and a couple others there. He informed me that he had checked the weather forecast a few minutes prior and the outlook for the next 24 hours was not good. Over an inch of rain today and continuing until late tomorrow afternoon. I thought June might show us some mercy but apparently not. When the girls arrived, we discussed the possibility of holing up here and pushing 15+ miles tomorrow to get to devils backbone brewery. Ultimately, they decided to push on to the next shelter so that tomorrow’s hike would be fewer miles. I stayed with chef and resolved to get moving again once the rain lessened. It kept on until well after 5pm at which point we decided we would stay and get an early jump tomorrow to get to the brewery. They don’t open until 11:30 so we figured that if we get moving by 6, we will still make it in with plenty of afternoon left to drink.

I scarfed a quick granola bar and got my pack cover on and then my raincoat. I figured I’d be walking downhill for the first few miles and not sweating too much to have it on. We hit the trail at 6:30 and climbed the short way up over the Priest and then started the long descent down to the road gap. We slowly dropped out of the perpetual cloud and the forest below was less dense with fog. I ditched the rain jacket and by the time I hit the road gap, you could almost see some contour in the clouds above as opposed to the oppressive gray mist we had been in since yesterday afternoon. Almost as good as sunshine itself was a couple providing trail magic in the parking lot. They were former thru hikers and had breakfast going. I stopped and fueled up and chatted with them and one of the local ridge runners about his experiences on the trail. After a while, we headed back out as we still had a 6 mile uphill to tackle and over 10 to go to get into Reeds Gap and the brewery. The sky was still mostly gray and spitting rain as I started the climb up the other side. It was a pretty long and persistent way up and over and I had myself convinced for the better part of 2 miles that I’d lost the trail. The gps on my app seemed to agree and I nearly turned around twice before I finally encountered a southbound hiker. She confirmed that I was still on the AT and that glow and ibex were ahead a ways. Phew. Lack of white blazes on the trees had me questioning everything. I eventually got over the top of Three Ridges and began the 4 mile descent to the road gap where I hoped to find a hitch down to the brewery. The rain let up a bit as I dropped elevation again and it had mostly stopped by the time I got to the road.

Joyce was our driver, a retiree who lived with her husband at the nearby wintergreen resort. We arrived at devils backbone after 15 minutes and found the girls at a table outside having arrived just ahead of us. We delighted in craft beer, grilled food and drier weather. The brewery has a tent space for thru hikers so we got set up there and then continued enjoying the offerings from the bar including white rum that they distilled themselves. We drank and ate until well past our normal bedtimes and enjoyed all of it. We will attempt to get the 19 miles into Waynesboro tomorrow and tent there....at another brewery.

Got myself pulled together and walked across the massive property back to the breakfast house. The sun was out and the sky looked imminently clear. The rest of the group had just sat down and started breakfast. I went inside and got my own order, a massive plate and phenomenal coffee for just $5. They also had us set up for a free ride back to the trailhead. This place has a reputation for being hiker friendly and it is more than well earned. Tommy drove us back out in their truck and we were quickly marching north again. The terrain was pretty smooth and with the sun out, spirits were high. We broke on top of an overlook that looked across to the ski runs at wintergreen resort. Nice view but I’m not likely booking a ski weekend there anytime real soon. As though trying to make up for days of lost sunshine, we lazed on the warm rocks for well over an hour. Finally, we collected ourselves and got back on the trail. The afternoon kind of dragged on and with about 5 miles left, we cane upon a stream crossing. With the sheer volume of rainfall seen in the last few weeks, “stream” more likely means river. Chef and I contemplated the crossing and decided we were better off finding something better upstream. This turned into a quarter mile of picking along the bank until I finally decided to tightrope a rain saturated log that was barely wider than my own leg. It was pretty touch and go but I made it and chef applauded the effort even though he filmed my attempt in case I fell in. He found another way across a little higher and we picked back through the forest to the trail. There was a shelter there and we held up to wait for ibex and glow stick. After a while, glow stick showed and wisely removed her shoes and simply waded across the creek. No sign of ibex and we wondered if maybe she had simply waded across too while chef and I were upstream playing Last of the Mohicans. We texted ibex and sure enough, she had continued down the trail and was now nearly three miles ahead. We figured out that the brewery in Waynesboro where we intended to camp was closed today. With no better option, we opted to stay near the shelter tonight and push the extra miles tomorrow. Ibex obviously did not want to backtrack and she decided to push on and either camp or seek a better option if she could get into Waynesboro. Glow, chef and I made dinner and were even gifted a few trail magic beers from a lady who was out with her dog for the weekend. We had a couple each before turning in. Tomorrow we will hike a bit beyond the Waynesboro gap and meet my parents who are going to pick us up at a Gap on skyline parkway just inside Shenandoah. Will be great to see them for a few days and have them meet the tramily.","Devils Backbone

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593851,"We got up at the usual time this morning (me at 8, the others before me) and did breakfast before hitting the trail. The 5 miles to Rockfish Gap were easy and it was a sunny and pleasant sky above. Glow and chef were waiting for me at the gap and we crossed over to Kings popcorn and hot dog stand for an early lunch/late morning snack. The hot dog was meh but the popcorn was pretty legit. As ever, the Dr Pepper was delicious and I nearly got another for the road but decided against it since my folks would be picking us up this afternoon and we would have several days ahead of town food. We recrossed the road and started our hike into Shenandoah park. The trail for the remainder of the afternoon looked much like what we had seen for the past few days. Plenty of green forest but not many impressive vistas. Rolling green hills and pretty easy trail was all. We stopped on the top of a hill with a bit of a view for lunch and also saw the tramily consisting of Gump, blood root, short sticks, ramble, and blue grass. We had been running into them frequently over the past few days and they’d just come out of Waynesboro so we got some intel on where to eat. The rest of the day went quickly and we arrived at the road gap where my parents were waiting. Ibex who had inadvertently gotten ahead of us yesterday was already there waiting with them and drinking a beer that my folks had brought. We all had one in the parking lot and made introductions before piling into the vehicle and heading into town. Uncle ray and aunt Tess were kind enough to lend the car for the next few days and it will probably never smell the same again. After showering at the hotel, we headed down to the green leaf grill in Waynesboro and enjoyed a tasty dinner courtesy of my folks. Ice cream at Kline’s after and then we headed back to the hotel for a nightcap and the ceremonial opening of my bday gift (peppermint themed everything, all individually wrapped). We made our plans to meet downstairs for breakfast and turned in. Looking forward to slackpacking without our full gear loads in the park tomorrow.","Paul Wolfe Shelter

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593854,"We all met downstairs for the complimentary breakfast and ate like hungry hikers do. Everyone loaded up in lighter packs for the day and we headed back up to Turk Gap where we had left off the day before. The weather was clear and the trail was easy and I made good time, arriving at a picnic area for a light lunch and water up with only six miles to go on the day. Several hikers notified me of bear sightings nearby and a couple had seen four already today. I was eager to spy one myself but the next few miles slipped by and nary a bear was seen. I arrived at the side trail that led down to the wayside where we’d agreed to meet my parents and I found chef already there lounging outside on a picnic table bench. He had seen a mom and her cub earlier and had video to show. They hadn’t minded him whatsoever and created a bit of a roadblock before finally clearing into the forest. I popped into the wayside for a sandwich and one of the trail famous blackberry milkshakes that did not disappoint. Glow and ibex arrived and reported no bear sightings but of course when my parents arrived, they had seen one during their short waterfall hike. I’m out here for nearly 3 months and see zero bears and they come out for a day hike and spot one instantly. Figures. I was somewhat redeemed when we saw a little cub foraging on the side of the road on our way out. Cute little bugger and he very nearly approached the vehicle when chef rolled down his window and put his hand out. He plodded back into the woods after a minute and we proceeded out of the park. Ok, one bear but it still doesn’t count unless I’m on the trail. For the evening entertainment, we rounded up our laundry and after some navigational miscues, found a laundromat to do some needed washing. We swung by kroger, ate at a divey Japanese grill nearby and then headed back to the hotel. We plan to notch 19 miles tomorrow, slackpacking again. It’s nice to have this chauffeur service lately, wish I could do the majority of the trail this way.","Turk Gap

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594361,"Another night of fine Hampton Inn rest and the group convened again in the lobby for breakfast. We had bought fresh berries at Kroger last night and went all out again with the Belgian waffles. Shooting for a 19 mile day, we loaded up again for the trail. My parents dropped us at the South River picnic area and we agreed on the pick up time at the Loft Mt Wayside. We would be hiking southbound today to end up where we had finished yesterday and we would again be able to take advantage of the milkshakes and sandwiches there. The terrain was as good as any I’ve seen and I motored through the forest with my lighter daypack (borrowed from dad). The day was mostly sunny and fairly cool in the woods, perfect hiking conditions. I stopped only briefly for snacks and was laser focused on making the wayside in good time. Several hikers I encountered said they’d seen bear and told me where to be looking. Almost the entire day had gone by without a sighting until the last half mile. I was coming up a slight rise and heard a crashing off in the forest to the right. I looked over to see a black bear butt, hightailing it into the woods. He had heard me and apparently didn’t want to hang out. I was excited to finally have seen a bear on the trail, I guess this months long trek won’t be a total waste after all. I made the wayside and found chef there waiting and I ordered a bbq sandwich and a drink along with a mocha milkshake. I know everyone raves about the blackberry shake but nobody puts mocha in the corner. My folks arrived and had a few beers for us to toast mile 900 and we waited a little while with glow stick before her friend would arrive to sweep her away to bonnaroo. We said our goodbyes in the parking lot and told her she had better burn ass to catch up after her festival weekend. We left her on the grass at the wayside and headed back down into town. A necessary stop at basic city brewery was in order and we pulled in to a pretty hopping place in a massive industrial warehouse space. The tap room led back into a huge game room/drinking hall/food service arena.  We made a food order and grabbed a table. The eats were solid, chicken satay, lettuce wraps, pirogis, sandwiches, all good stuff. Fat and happy, we headed back to the hotel and I had a nightcap with my folks and we watched the Caps clinch the Stanley cup. Tomorrow we will head to Luray and my folks will go back to the DC area. Ibex’s boyfriend zach is coming down from ny so after a zero tomorrow, we will lean on him for more slackpacking assistance. He and ibex are staying at the budget inn which means chef and I need to figure out where we can crash in town in the cheap. Or free.","Fishersville VA

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594362,"We did breakfast once more down in the lobby and finished off the berries from the day before. My folks had plans to hit harpers ferry this afternoon so we made a quick exit from the hotel and headed off to Luray where they would drop us. Zach was heading there to meet up with ibex later in the afternoon. We made the hour plus drive and admired the views of the Shenandoah ridge before ascending to the town. It’s a quaint little place with a Main Street that has most hiker needs covered including eateries, motels and an outfitter. We stopped there because I wanted to get a bag liner that I would use for a summer blanket and then I could send my 20 degree down quilt back with my folks. They had the one I had been eyeing in other shops along the way so I picked it up. I also found some trail runners in the hiker box that were if the exact same make and size as my own except with less holes on the toe box. I decided to grab them and see if they’d feel alright if I put my insoles from my pair in them and hopefully get them to last til the halfway point around harpers ferry. We also found out from the shop manager elyse that we would be welcome to tent at her house while we were in Luray. Score! This saves chef and I from having to pay for a motel and ensures we will be out of ibex and Zach’s hair for his visit. After we left the outfitter, we said goodbye to my parents and they drove off to head back toward ray and Tess’s near DC. Their visit seemed to fly by but really enjoyed having them here. Hopefully they will make it out once more in late August before I finish. 
Chef ran over to get a haircut and ibex and I posted up in the coffee shop/deli for a while and had sandwiches and beer before chef joined us again. They both opted to grab a cat nap whereas I decided to just go straight to the local brewery. Hawksbill was just around the corner off the railroad tracks and i ponied up to the taproom bar where I tried the local fare. It wasn’t the most impressive beer I’ve had out here but it was definitely beer and when the hell have I been that picky anyway? After a couple hours of solo flying through pints, chef arrived and then ibex and Zach. We all enjoyed a few more rounds and agreed we would need to eat soon. The easiest option seemed to be gennaros, a little Italian joint next to the budget inn. It was no frills but totally acceptable grub and our immediate needs were gratified. I reached out to elyse from the outfitter and confirmed her address before hitching a ride with Zach and ibex over there. Elyse was kind enough to put me up on a couch in the basement so I didn’t have to set up outside in the dark. Chef showed a few minutes later and decided to tent for his own reasons. That’s another story altogether. The plan is to cruise up to Shenandoah for another day of slackpacking courtesy of zach and his vehicle but we will go easy on miles since he is hiking with us tomorrow.","Fishersville VA

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594720,"I waaaaay overslept on the couch in the very dark basement and apparently also did not hear my phone going off with text messages from ibex and a call from chef. It was nearly 9 when I realized my gaffe and I scrambled to get my things together and get out of there. Ibex and zach were just finishing breakfast and chef was just walking around the front of the house so apparently I didn’t wreck our timetable to badly. Chef and I got a lift back into town to meet ibex and Zach at the coffee shop and grabbed a breakfast sandwich of my own. We loaded up Zach’s car and headed back up to Shenandoah park, this time we would leave his car parked at the days endpoint and hitch out to the picnic area where we had left off yesterday. A couple college kids soon scooped us up and we got on the trail around eleven. The terrain continues to be pretty easy and it was sunny with a few clouds. I churned out the mileage and around the midway point, spooked another bear. He heard me coming around the corner and went bombing down the hillside into the forest. It’s cool that we are getting to see some wild bears finally but I’m content to have them hauling ass away from me. We finished up at Big Meadows Wayside and I had some terribly disappointing chili cheese fries and an above average milkshake. Chef had missed the turnoff and overhiked by about a mile and a half so he was late doubling back. Ibex and zach rolled in a bit after and we all took our time snacking in the sun outside at a picnic table. We piled back into Zach’s car and headed back into Luray. Obviously hungry, we stopped at uncle bucks on the main drag and grabbed dinner. Average ribs and worse service but basically acceptable. When we finished, I texted elyse to see if we were cool to crash at her place once again and she said that we were. It had been too rainy since we got in town to ever take advantage of her pool so that was borderline tragedy. When we arrived, she asked if we wanted to go down to her friends propety on the Shenandoah river. We didn’t have much pep but agreed to go since she had been so accommodating. We drove about 15 minutes across the river and on to a county road where we had to park up top and walk down to the water. It was boggy from the rain and buggy as hell and we were not really feeling it. I’m sure it’s a lovely place when the sun is out and a bit drier but we kind of huddled uncomfortably around the dying campfire and drank a few beers and made small talk with her friends. After maybe an hour we asked if maybe we should head back and she agreed so we slopped through the mud back up to the cars. We thanked her friends for having us and drove back across town to her house. I posted up on the couch again tonight and vowed to set an alarm so that I didn’t go radio dark again. Tomorrow Zach will drive us back up to the trail at Big Meadows before he heads back to New York.","Luray

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594845,"Got up at a reasonable hour and reached out to ibex to see if they might be able to pick chef and I up from elyse’s house, she said they would head over shortly. Elyse then told us that her mom was making pancakes and that we were invited to stay for breakfast. She assured us there was plenty for all and invited ibex and Zach to come over as well. We gladly convened upstairs and filled our plates up and then chatted in the living room with Elyse’s dad while we ate. We thanked our gracious hosts and headed out of Luray. After a stop at Subway in Elkins, we returned to the big meadows wayside and plopped all of our gear around the same picnic table we had ended at yesterday. I decided to house the sandwich I’d bought and washed it down with a coke from the wayside. I also decided to grab a couple tall boy beers from inside because...beer. We took our sweet time getting ready to head out and we ultimately decided that we would only be shooting for the first shelter past the wayside at a measly 4.4 miles out. The weather was threatening to barf rain again and we hoped for mercy at least until we made camp. Goodbyes were said to zach and we took to the trail again.The early going was smooth and things stayed dry for the first mile and a half. It was not meant to last when the sky darkened severely and my afternoon walk in the forest turned dark like the sun had already set. The heavy rain began soon after and I was fully drenched moments later. The remaining hike into camp was not long but it was miserable. I found the side trail down to the shelter and stomped through puddles with ibex following after me. We picked our respective tent sites and used a break in the weather to get set up. Chef rolled in a bit later having hidden from the rain under a rock outcropping, perfectly dry of course. After we all set up, we found a nice patio with a picnic table in front of a locked cabin just below the shelter. The three of us had dinner and drank the rest of the rum that ibex had bought at devils backbone. I basically just rummaged for snacks in my bag and drank my tall boys. The weather had cleared for sunset but more rain is in the cards for tonight and lower temps to boot.","Luray

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594877,"The rain kept up all night and was still coming down steadily when I started to get packed up in the morning. Ibex was down by the cabin patio table finishing breakfast when I strolled down and we looked at each other with a mix of dread and annoyance over the early weather. We knew that the Skyland Resort Hotel was not far up the trail and decided to get up there and stop in for a coffee and possibly hide from the rain for a bit. I left in pouring rain and it continued until I had made the meager mileage up to the resort grounds. Ibex had beat me there and was warming up in the check-in lobby. The rooms were fairly pricy but the rain was forecast to keep on until the next morning and all of our gear was soaked. I was also contemplating the overnight temps I’d have to endure with just my bag liner and light clothing. After a coffee in the resort cafe and a few minutes of warming up, I decided I was content to stay for the night. When chef arrived, we announced our intention to lay up and he decided he would join us. I checked in and walked down the steep path to our hotel building and got out of wet clothes and into the hot shower. I also used the tub to rinse out gear that had been covered in forest bits from days and days of rain. My tent, pack cover, and rain jacket were rinsed and hung to dry along with some of the clothes I’d been wearing the past few days. We spent the rest of the afternoon lounging around watching cable movies and the rain and fog outside. We all cooked dinner from our own food bags on the porch outside but after a while ibex and I decided we had to go back up to the lodge for a beer and dessert. Of course that turned in to me having full blown second dinner along with dessert and a couple beers. If you’re gonna take a nearo, you might as well go all in, ya know? The weather promises to clear in the morning and we should be able to push some bigger miles to make up for the days laziness.","Rock Springs Hut

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595086,"The immense fog cloud had cleared by this morning and our view down into the valley was somewhat cleared. I imagine on a totally cloudless day, this is really a great view but there were still plenty of low white clouds filling in the void. We gathered our gear up and walked back up to the lodge to drop the room keys and then got back on the trail. It was starting to look like a sunny day and the terrain was favorable as it has been throughout Shenandoah. I stumbled upon another bear on the trail, this one cleared off the path but then stopped on top of a rock and watched me from about 20 feet away. I snapped a pic and tried to start up a convo but he was nonplussed and I thought it better to keep moving. I descended a short ways to the next shelter and stopped to use the privy. There was a posted sign in the shelter about a problem bear that has been in the area and wondered if the brave fellow I just came across was him. The rest of the day was fairly uneventful and I made the final wayside in the park by late afternoon and indulged in a sandwich and milkshake once more. I was worried about the overnight temps for the coming nights and impulse bought a fleece throw blanket from the gift shop. All of my bulk and weight savings from ditching the winter gear has now been replaced by a big fluffy blanket with a vista portrait of Shenandoah on it but at least I can sleep warmly again for the next few nights. After chef and ibex got there and ate we climbed up to a campsite a bit higher on the ridge.

Eager to finally leave Shenandoah (2 days longer than anticipated) and to get into Front Royal for food and drink. I pressed myself and stopped only briefly for snacks in order to make good time and to get out of the park at long last. The weather was cloudy but the rain wasn’t materializing yet so I kept hustling. Just after I left the park, I heard a rustling below me in the woods. A mama bear and her baby cub were doing a tree climbing lesson and when she spotted me, she rested up on her hind legs and locked eye contact with me. I kept staring but started walking down the trail away from her. When her cub slipped off his tree trunk, she let out a screeching sound and they both went crashing downhill away from me. I let out a deep breath and held up a moment to wait for a woman who I had passed not long ago. When she approached I told her what I had seen and we walked together for the next couple miles and chatted about the trail. I made the road crossing for Front Royal and waited for ibex and chef. We were able to quickly hitch into town in the back of a pickup and decided to walk over to Spelunkers for a burger. Maybe the best burger on the trail so far and the chocolate malt was incredible too. We then headed over to Main Street hoping to pop into the outfitters and inquire about tenting somewhere around town. They had closed early today so our next move was an obvious one, next door to the brewery for beers and further contemplation. We asked the bartender about places to stay and she didn’t know of much but after a while one of the waiters approached and chatted us up about his own thru hike last year. After a while, we were starting to get panicked and debating some door knocking on local churches to see if we could tent there. Thankfully, our friendly waiter returned and kindly offered to let us crash at his place. We gladly accepted and once he had finished his shift, we piled into his car and made our way to his house nearby. His girlfriend heather was there to greet us and we were able to get showers before posting up in the living room to crash for the night. The trail provides!

They gave us a lift back out to the Shop n Save and we thanked them again for everything. A quick resupply was done and we then went to find something to eat nearby. KFC was about the only option in the plaza and none of us could get behind that so we decided we would have to walk back over to spelunkers once more. It was 10:30 and they didn’t open until eleven but it was too good yesterday not to go again. We waited a few minutes outside and then bounced in as soon as they unlocked the doors. Went with a chicken Philly this time and it was just as legit as the rest had been. I also grabbed a cake and brownie batter shake even though I told myself I wasn’t going to. Worth it. A nice older couple struck up a convo while we were outside and they were familiar with the trail and happened to live up past the trailhead. Hello ride out of town. Once we got out there again, we knew we would be leaving chef behind this afternoon. He has had a goal of doing a 50 mile day at some point on the trail and has decided that he will attempt this beginning at midnight and try to push all the way into Harpers Ferry by late tomorrow. Ibex and I were not trying to join him in this beast mode attempt so we opted to hike on for 15 miles in the afternoon and reconvene with him in 2 days. He wants to take two zeros when he’s done so we will be able to rendezvous. We hope glow stick might be able to burn miles and meet us in Harpers as well. The rest of the day was decent terrain with some up and down and we stopped briefly at one of the cooler shelters on the trail, complete with solar shower, horseshoe pit, pavilion, and a massive porch with a bench. The sun was slipping behind the hills when we descended to our evening shelter and we set up tents behind the newer of two. The fireflies were going off like crazy in the forest before bed and it was the most impressive display I’ve seen yet. Chef will cruise by us at some point very early tomorrow morning and we will push 2 days to meet him in town.

Virginia really hasn’t been too punishing with its ascents and descents so I guess we’ve been spoiled for a while, apparently we will pay for it today. The morning was clear and warm, it’s getting borderline hot these days. The first 8 miles were smooth and not demanding and we stopped for a brief moment before the start of the roller coaster. Raggedy Crow was there and he snapped a pic of ibex and I at the welcome sign. The first couple climbs weren’t too wicked and we had circled a creek spot a few miles in where we could stop for lunch. Just before our ascent to that creek, we stumbled across some trail magic at the dirt road gap below. Four gals in their forties were set up with cold drinks, hot dogs and various other munchies. We pulled up a couple chairs and snacked and drank for a few. They did a yearly section hike and trail magic day and a couple of them had aspirations to thru hike some day. We recommended it adamantly as we always do. They also made a strong recommendation for us to stop at Bears Den Hostel a few miles down the trail. It was the second time in as many days that someone had insisted we go, so ibex and I looked at the map and decided a stop there tonight wouldn’t prevent us from making Harpers Ferry tomorrow. It was less than a mile from our intended camp anyway so we said what the hell. The next major milestone in our journey was a couple miles later when we hit the 1,000 mile marker. Obviously stopped to snap a few pics and let that one sink in. Seems strange to say that I’ve walked 1,000 miles on this trek. Seems even stranger to think that I’ll more than double it to finish. We ascended a couple more hills of the roller coaster before finding the side trail to Bears Den and rolled in. Glen, the caretaker welcomed us and rang us up for the nights stay. We opted to camp out on their beautiful lawn to save a few bucks but still took advantage of the amenities (shower, laundry, pizza, ice cream). The property is maintained by the ATC and serves as a kind of education center as well as being a hostel. It’s a beautiful stone castle built in the 1930s and the surrounding grounds were very stately. So many times I wish I could spend more than just a day at some of these places but I’d soon be broke or too pudgy to press on. Ibex and I scarfed dinner and ice cream and then went head to head with a game of the AT board game, apparently I haven’t been paying close enough attention to the plants and birds on the trail because she mopped the floor with me. We turned in soon after dark and will finish the roller coaster early tomorrow and push 20 miles into harpers ferry.

The caretaker provides pancake with fresh blueberries and coffee and you just whip it up yourself on the griddle and do your own dishes. I had some left over Americone Dream Ben and Jerry’s from last night so I topped my pancakes with ice cream because I’m an adult and no one tells me how to live. Ibex and I gathered up our gear and hit the trail again. The last bit of the roller coaster was no problem and shortly after we left it, we came upon another major milestone: the VA/WV border! In all, I had spent 43 days in Virginia and hiked just over 550 miles to get through it. It was the wettest season on record for the longest state on the trail and I was all too glad to be turning the page once more. We took a couple photos and continued on as we wanted to get into town sooner than later. After a brief lunch up on some unimpressive rocks, we churned out the final ten miles of the day. I arrived into the historic town a few minutes before ibex and rested gladly on a park bench. When she rolled up, she was adamant that we get down to the AT Conservancy office before they closed in order to get our official halfway numbers and photos taken. We made it there with five minutes to spare and implored the kindly gentleman behind the desk to oblige us and soon we had our bona fides. I had never gotten a number to begin the trail because the only office is down at Amicalola Falls which is the approach trail. I got dropped directly at Springer Mt the morning I began and thus had not gotten a tag. I am officially thru hiker number 825 this season to pass through Harpers Ferry. That’s a lot of people ahead of me and if rumors are to be believed there’s an even larger bubble of people behind. I also marveled at the 3D relief map inside that shows the entire trail and it’s elevation gains. New Hampshire and southern Maine look like the business but for that matter i was seriously impressed with how much we had been tested in GA, NC, and TN. We’ve come a long way. The immediate future looks pretty flat and hopefully that means chewing up some easy mileage although I have a feeling the trail won’t make it too easy.
Once we had finished, we contacted Tumblina via text. She is a former thru hiker that runs an as-yet-unofficial hostel across the street from the ATC. Word of mouth brought us there and for $20/night it was a perfect spot to bunk in town for our planned zero tomorrow. We walked over and met her and she welcomed us in and we threw down our stuff and headed over to the pizza place to meet Chef. I also grabbed some beers at the LQ and we ate and cheered to our many recent milestones as well as chefs crazy 50 mile achievement. He was still feeling frazzled and tired so we didn’t stay out long. Once back at the hostel, we took care of showers and combined a load of laundry. It wasn’t long before we all were ready to crash.

There was also a badass little bakery down there so we obviously ate our fill before shopping. Once all that was done we made our way back to town and walked over to the ATC where glow stick had arrived and was getting her official halfway credentials. We took her back over to the hostel and then walked down to the historic town center and had a bite to eat and a beer. We walked up the steep sidewalk back to Tumblinas and once there, did some backpack scrubbing and Permethrin treating in the lawn while the sun was out. Tumblina and Wahoo were having a cookout this afternoon so we helped them set up the canopy in the yard and brought the table downstairs. It was a short walk down her street to an incredible view of the convergence of the Potomac and the Shenandoah rivers and we spent a few minutes down there taking it all in. Once we had walked back up the street, the bbq was in full effect and we indulged in food and drink for the remainder of the day. We also had another reunion when Matt strolled in at the end of the day. He had left us all the way back in Hiawassee GA and has been pushing big mileage to catch up to our group.

Wahoo offered to run us down to the Walmart again this morning and we took the opportunity to hit the Royalicious deli once more and buy some beers for the day. The consensus was that no one wanted to hike out into the mid 90s heat this afternoon and so we would wait until later in the day to get out and hike into the evening. Wahoo works for a local river guide company and he set us up with some flat water tubing for the day. Chef had decided to just chill in town so Ibex, glow stick, show pony and I caught a lift out there and do a few laps on the river to make the most out of a super hot day. If I didn’t already mention it, show pony us the name matt has now adopted upon the insistence of Ibex. It’s a pretty funny nickname and he said he’d adopt a name we gave him if he didn’t already have one when he arrived at Harpers. 
The tubing company ran bus shuttles up and down the river and we did three laps before deciding to get back to town and force ourselves to leave the vortex and rejoin life on the trail. The bus took us back to the rafting place and wahoo came and scooped us up again. He dropped us in town in front of the ATC office where chef was waiting and we slowly got our packs mounted up and ready to roll. We walked once more down the historic streets and of course popped in to a sandwich shop to get some town food for camp tonight. Finally, I clipped my hip buckle and started the flat walk out of town. The trail crossed the river near it’s junction on a steel railroad bridge and then followed a flat gravel bike path between the woods and river for over 2 miles. The heat was still oppressive even this late in the day and I began to dread those summer days ahead where this will be the norm. The 6+ miles up the hill to the first shelter wasn’t too terrible considering I’d spent the afternoon drinking cheap light beer on an innertube in the river but it wasn’t exactly fun either. We had gotten a text from Tumblina and Wahoo who wanted to hike up and meet us and camp for the night. It was nearly dark when we arrived to the shelter and by the time I’d set up my tent and made the ludicrously long hike down to the spring for water, it was total dark. I didn’t really much enjoy the gyro I’d packed out but force fed myself anyway. The heat made me want nothing but water but I know the calories are still very much needed. Tumblina and Wahoo did make it up to camp and we chatted with them for an hour or so before turning in. Pretty exhausted tonight and the heat tells me it’s not going to be the most comfortable night of sleep.","Harpers Ferry WV

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595466,"It was quite warm last night but managed to sleep decently due mostly from baking in the sun and drinking yesterday. Broke down camp and saw Tumblina and Wahoo off as they had to get to work in Harpers Ferry this morning. We told them to travel up north and see us again if they can get a couple free days later this summer. Started hiking and found the Maryland terrain to be quite forgiving, nice wide track without too many rocks or ups and downs. Made good time to the Dahlgren campground after 10+ miles. Have come across some interesting civil war sites today and love reading about the history that this area has seen. I also am reminded how little I actually know about the civil war and wish I had the time to tour more battle sites as I go along. 
We all waited out a brief rain shower at the campground bathrooms and learned that there was a pizza place nearby that will deliver to the road gap up ahead. Hello dinner. I also spoke to my dad for a few minutes and he said they would be heading out east again during the end of August. Hello hotel rooms AND dinner! The pizza was delivered on time and we were fully fueled for the remaining 7 miles up to camp. Along the way, we passed the original Washington monument, an impressive stone tower atop the ridge that apparently was not large or phallic enough to hold down the title. They eventually built the bigger one in DC and this one is now more of a curiosity but has a nice view anyway. I arrived at the Annapolis rocks campsite a bit before dark and did a full circuit around the sprawled tent sites and back to the spring before finding the others and deciding on a camp. We went out to the view at the rocks to watch the sunset and made our plans for tomorrow. My uncle ray has graciously offered to come down from Fairfax VA and meet up as well as put us up in a hotel in Waynesboro PA. No argument here. We will meet him at Pen Mar park tomorrow afternoon right near the mason Dixon line.","Ed Garvey Shelter

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595557,"After leaving camp this morning, we found some trail magic. One of glow sticks friends had given her specific location and directions for a bottle of whiskey that they had hidden right off the trail last year. She and ibex hiked ahead and by the time I walked up they were just popping the top. Since the girls were celebrating their three month trailiversary today, of course we did three shots apiece to start our day. Nothing like hiking 16 miles with a headwind of Jack Daniels. Suffice to say, the morning kinda flew by for me. The terrain was easy once again and since we had plans to meet my uncle Ray at Pen Mar park at 3, I just powered through the day on snacks alone. It rained for a bit during my last climb and made the descent down large boulders more slippery than I’d prefer. I walked into the park just after 2:30 and soon saw Ray pull into the lot. He greeted me and noted my smell immediately. I hugged him because I’m a jerk. He had brought a whole smorgasbord of goodies that I helped him unload from the vehicle onto the picnic tables. I noticed he had put towels on the seats of the car and I asked him if our collective essence had stayed in the vehicle after my parents had borrowed it and slackpacked us for a few days. He said they considered torching the vehicle after they got it back. He and I chatted for a few before chef rolled up and eventually glow stick, show pony and ibex too. We feasted on brats, salad, brownies, chips and salsa and sodas. The beer he brought had to stay in the car according to the park ranger. We also had a surprise visit from Ms. Janet, a trail famous angel who travels up and down the AT corridor each summer in her van helping out hikers, usually with a cold drink or a lift somewhere. She imparted some nuggets of wisdom for us as we are approaching the halfway point: 1) Keep your protein uptake up or your body will eat itself. 2) Be diligent about checking for ticks. 3) Don’t go crazy trying to increase our mileage averages. Good advice all around. Soon after, we loaded everything and ourselves back into Rays vehicle and headed down to the cobblestone inn where we were gifted two rooms for the evening by my generous aunt and uncle. Ray had a bit of work to do from his laptop and waited downstairs in the lobby while we all showered and changed for dinner. The consensus choice was a sushi restaurant that had favorable reviews online and Ray drove us down. We grabbed a table and when we learned that the place was BYOB, Ray sprang up to grab all the beer that we couldn’t drink in the park from the cooler out in his car. With a table full of bottled beer, we chowed down on some seriously high quality sushi (in PA?) and had a great time. Ray offered to pick up the tab on one condition. He is now a successful thru-hiker and I have several friends that can corroborate. Ray returned us to our hotel and we bade him farewell. It was far too short a visit but always great to see him and so kind of he and Tess to shell out such luxury for hiker trash like us. We spent the rest of the evening doing laundry at the hotel and popping into the pool for a swim. The pool was frigid and the hot tub broken so it wasn’t long before I was up in the room for another hot shower. Tried to stay awake long enough to watch some South Park but I’m 89 years old these days and was out well before midnight.","Annapolis Rocks camp

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595612,"We slept in a bit because hotel beds and chef made a quick trip over to Walmart and picked up fresh berries and whipped cream so we could do proper Belgian waffles downstairs at the continental breakfast. Two traveling businessmen marveled at our spread and we proudly feasted. Froot Loops, biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs, followed by a Belgian waffle, power food. We also chatted again with Oak and Twin Oak in the lobby, twin brothers that like to spend a few days each season providing shuttles and other trail magic. We checked out at 10:45 and made a quick resupply stop at Walmart. The girls went over to the Sheetz gas station to get subs and caught a fast hitch back up. Chef, pony and I met a nice woman with her 3 boys who section hikes a lot in the area and she offered us a ride back up. We all crammed in to her van and were back at Pen Mar park in just a few minutes. We thanked her and got back on the trail. We passed the border into Pennsylvania shortly after and along with it, the mason Dixon line. We are now officially in the north and it feels like every few days now we are reaching a new milestone that would have felt very far away at the beginning of the trail. These nebulous and far off goals are coming more and more into focus and the possibility of finishing the trail seems less like hopeful thinking and more like something attainable. The afternoon terrain was pretty straightforward despite a couple decent inclines; I was grateful for that due both to the significant afternoon heat and the after effects of whiskey, beer, and sangria yesterday. It had poured last night while we ate dinner and there was a chance of afternoon thunderstorm but we were spared any trouble and made it 15 miles to the shelter. I had packed out a Subway sandwich and destroyed it immediately along with a 32 ounce Gatorade I’d hauled out, worth every gram of the added weight. The others arrived and sat around the picnic table and did their dinner routines as well. It may rain overnight so I’ve grabbed a spot in the shelter. Packing out a wet tent leads to more work the next evening so more and more I’m willing to duck into a shelter to avoid heavy rain which still presents a constant threat. ","Waynesboro PA

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596061,"Slept warmly enough in the liner with all my clothes on last night, I’m still walking a tightrope with the overnight temps but I’m confident summer will arrive at some point. Unfortunately, that day is not today as the forecast says we would be getting wet alllll day. The morning started out merely gloomy and cloudy but no rain falling so we made quick work of breakfast and got on the trail. It held off for the morning and we passed a super cool shelter with a full patio area, bench swing, pavilion, even potted plants. Say what you will about Pennsylvania, their Shelter game has been on point. We decided to push to the next shelter for lunch and the sky turned darker and the rain began just as I was rolling in. It was another really cool setup with  built-in bunks and a privy the size of a summer cottage. We waited on the rain for a couple hours and decided that eventually we would have to push out to our planned stop six miles on. Chef brewed a strong pot of coffee and I warmed up and got a caffeine kick to power me through. It rained consistently and I barely stopped to celebrate the official midway point of the trail. Dubs was at the road gap where it was marked and we merely shared a fist bump before slogging on. I arrived in camp and it was still coming down so I decided to snag the last spot open in the shelter. It might be cool, but I’m determined to keep my tent dry until I can actually set it up again in a non-deluge situation. The group dined under the pavilion at the shelter and we were treated by a couple of weekenders to some whisky shots. Johnny walker black label never tasted so good and we could officially celebrate being past the halfway point. It’s all downhill from here! Except of course for the literally hundreds of miles of uphill climbing that we will still do.","Rocky Mt Shelters

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596064,"The rain was steady all night and I was glad to be in a shelter yet again, the temps didn’t drop too low so I slept comfortably. We got out of camp rather quickly as we knew we could buy breakfast at the general store down in pine Grove furnace. It rained for the first couple miles and cleared off a bit as I descended to the road gap. Pine Grove furnace is also infamous for hosting the half gallon challenge. Essentially, it’s a tradition for thru hikers to attempt to down a half gallon of ice cream as quickly as possible. I ordered a breakfast wrap first and after I’d finished, decided against the ice cream. My fingers were still partially numb from the morning rain and I didn’t particularly want to lower my body temperature any further by inhaling a bucket of ice cream. Luckily, there’s always Head Chef to take on an eating challenge and he did not disappoint. The previous timed record for this year was 21 minutes, chef did it in 12 minutes, 50 seconds. This was both greatly entertaining and somewhat horrifying, he must’ve taken down the last pint in about 40 seconds. He did manage to give the interior of his mouth a pretty good freezer burn and he belched loudly on the trail as we hiked on. There was another grocery/grill later in the day that we stopped at because why eat any of your own food that you’ve carried for a hundred miles when you can buy a sandwich at a deli? We avoided the rain this afternoon and found a nice flat spot down by a creek to set up for the night. Tomorrow we will hit Boiling Springs early for brunch (I mean, it’s sunday and we are civilized people) and also the outfitter before pushing on.","Toms Run Shelter

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596071,"It was a nice rainless night and there were blue skies this morning when I lit out of camp. I was eager for town food so I went for it on an empty stomach. The terrain was good, just a slight uphill out of camp before a long descent out of the woods and a mile or so of field strolling through farmland before the town. Boiling Springs is a very charming little place with a huge stocked pond at the center of the town surrounded by well-kept little houses, very Norman Rockwell. I first popped in to TCO outfitters and perused some of their gear. It was a very well stocked little shop despite its emphasis on fly fishing gear. I swapped out my pair of Darn Tough socks that had developed holes (ok, it was my fault for applying super glue to my shoe while wearing them and then having it leak onto said sock and tearing a whole when I tried to get it off-sue me). The outfitter gal also showed me some pics of the famed Pennsylvania rocks that would be waiting for us in the northern end of the state. I finished there and went over to the cafe and grabbed a table before the others arrived. We all contemplated how nice this town was and how much we’d love to stay but ultimately decided we would have to move on. The tavern was closed because it’s sunday, so what would really be the point? After breakfast, I made the decision to go back to the outfitter and throw down for a new pair of trail runners. They had the same style of salomon that I’ve been wearing and I sized up again to an 11.5. I also needed another fuel canister which I grabbed. Glow stick had also decided it was time for new kicks so we both were styling on the walk out of town. This lasted only moments before the trail became a mud bog that intermittently went on for the next few miles of forest walking just behind the farm lands. I cringed every time I stepped into a new pile of slip and my shiny new blue shoes were properly trail baptized. Oh well, they don’t stay young forever.The rest of the afternoon was almost entirely flat, nearly ten miles of field/forest walking through farm country. I could see the ridge we had to climb in the distance and it looked impossibly far away. Just after I had crossed a highway, the afternoon rain storm descended. I was walking near ibex and foreman when the worst 35 minute storm I’ve yet seen came whipping in. Rain was coming at me sideways like standing in front of an open fire hydrant. As soon as it had come though, it passed and the sky returned to mostly blue with a few puffy white clouds. Ibex and I laughed maniacally at the absurdity of the weather we have been through and dripped with rain water. The climb up to the shelter was short but strenuous and it was late in the evening when I finally got set up. We will pass through yet another town tomorrow, Duncannon, where we are going to stop in for resupply. Even though we have been restaurant blazing pretty hard lately, we do still need some food items.","Alec Kennedy shelter

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596365,"Went for a quick breakfast before starting the 10ish mile hike into Duncannon. Although the AWOL guide warned of the rocky trail conditions on the ridge before the descent into town, it wasn’t difficult at all and I was dropping down before I knew it. I walked along the road/trail that cuts through town until I arrived at the Doyle, a trail famous hotel/bar that is known for its divey blue collar vibe. It definitely didn’t disappoint and I texted the tramily that I’d need a tetanus shot if I was going to stay in town for the night. I definitely wasn’t going to skip having a beer though and I talked with the owners and a couple regulars about the trail and waited for the others. They rolled in and had a drink and we then mobilized to get a load of laundry done and eat lunch. The Doyle ran an afternoon shuttle up to Mutzbaughs grocery store so we all jumped in on that along with a few other thru hikers. I peppered in several beers between the Doyle and lunch and then the Doyle again; I don’t do my strongest resupply shopping when buzzed but it is usually more fun. After we finished, they ran us back down to the Doyle and we decided to get back on the trail rather than stay for the night. We will try to get a rest day soon but this didn’t really feel like the town for R and R. It was a brutally hot afternoon and I made the questionable decision of downing a malt from the ice cream shop before leaving. I battled beer and malt burps as we climbed up the ridge to the shelter. We set up on a slightly pitched area and hopefully won’t be sliding into the bottom of my tent all night. Hoping to get another decent mileage day tomorrow and continue to chew through Pennsylvania.","Darlington Shelter

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596375,"The sloped hillside where we camped was not great but slept decently anyway, we got gathered up, ate breakfast and left. We decided to stop at Kinter viewpoint to have lunch as it was reportedly a rattlesnake den and we kinda wanted to see some. Brilliant, right? I was the first to arrive and I slowly made my way around the rocks searching for any sign of snake. I clicked my trekking poles around the ledges and slowly checked under shrubs and low tree branches but found no sign. The others showed up and we snacked on lunch and basked in the sun. Ibex had laid down next to the shade of a pine tree whose trunk was just below me from the rock ledge I was sitting on. From there, I watched a medium sized rattler slither up to the trunk and curl up for a nap. I reported what I was seeing and the others crowded around to check him out and Ibex slowly put her boots and moved just in case he decided he’d need more room. Chef used his trekking pole to move back the branches over him and he watched the trekking pole for a moment before starting to rattle a bit. He had slid off behind the tree and down the hill a little and we started gathering up our things when I noticed he had returned. Then I noticed he was larger and a lighter gray color as opposed to brownish. In fact it was an entirely different snake and when chef lifted his branch to get a closer look, we heard a much larger rattle and saw a much thicker snake. He started to slide back under the rock ledge when the brown one returned and also headed for the same ledge. Rattlesnake den indeed! I decided I’d seen about enough for one session and got back on the trail. We hiked down the ridge toward a road gap and glow stick and Ibex pulled off for a spring refill while I hiked on with show pony and chef just behind me. I heard a pretty loud crashing in the woods and spotted a big black bear butt charging up the hill away from the trail. I thought bears in Pennsylvania were less prevalent but apparently they are out here after all, glad that they still seem skittish though. Glow stick will be upset as she has still yet to see a bear on the trail. The hike up the other side of the ridge was gradual and we found our campsite up top with a nice pine needle cover.

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596379,"With rain forecast for the entire day, I prepared myself for a long one, we are shooting for 21 miles as well. It was cloudy from the get go but I made it out of camp before any precipitation really began. It did start to get wet after a couple miles and I was hustling to get to the first shelter after 8 miles to eat lunch. I made it there and show pony followed a few minutes later and then the friendly South Africans. I didn’t take too long with lunch since it was supposed to rain until tomorrow and there was no point in trying to time my hike for better weather, this was as good as it gets. The precipitation remained fairly light and I was content with that until I reached a point in the trail that had flooded. I would find out later that a beaver dam had busted under the heavy rain of the season and left this low point full of water, shin deep. I stood there and contemplated my route before realizing it was not to be circumvented. Since the mosquitos were particularly vicious, I said to hell with it and stomped through, totally soaking socks and shoes. I came across glow stick and chef who had taken the time to remove their shoes before walking through. I figured soaked, muddy feet going back into damp socks and shoes and then walking all afternoon in the rain would achieve roughly the same effect as stomping through the puddle so it’ll all even out. The rest of the afternoon kind of dragged on for obvious reasons and the ascent to the top of the ridge and shelter was a bit grueling, I was properly beat when I finally got in. I scoped the top floor of the shelter that had room for around 5 people and asked the couple already set up if they minded more company. Ibex also threw her stuff up there and show pony decided to set up downstairs too. Once everyone had arrived at camp, we called to see about shuttle options to get into Hamburg tomorrow. The weather is supposed to be really wet overnight and we haven’t taken a day off the trail in a while. The Rock n Sole hostel is going to grab us tomorrow morning and we will go in on a room at the Microtel in town. Chef also nearly stepped on a big rattler while screwing around on his phone and hiking at the same time. They got some video and this one was a monster.

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596385,"Never in my life have I heard or seen such a rainstorm as last night. It came down like an inland hurricane and lasted for 3+ hours. There were also lightning strikes that could not have been more than a tenth of a mile away. The window of the shelter loft was flashing like a strobe as I lay awake watching it for close to an hour. I worried for glow stick and chef who opted to tent up on the ridge near the trail. Since we had very few miles to make our shuttle pick up at the road gap, I quickly scarfed some dry granola before leaving the shelter for the ridge. Glow and chef had made it through the night but glow stick had to move her tent into some very high grass in order to escape the flooded muddy ground in the camp and chef merely sat awake while the floor of his tent began to float in several inches of rainwater. We were all eager to get down and into town and we hiked quickly to the road gap. As soon as our ride pulled in, we saw that the left rear tire was riding low and upon closer inspection, heard are hissing out. One of Pennsylvania’s smaller rocks had pierced the wall and punctured the tire. We made quick work of changing out to the spare and were soon on our way. Several roads had flooded in the night and we had to take a couple detours to get to town. We learned that the storm had dropped five inches last night! That is an obscene amount of accumulation but the evidence was everywhere with swollen creeks and streams and standing water in many places. Can’t even imagine how messy the trail is going to be the next few days but at least we don’t have to endure it today. Once at the hotel, we did our usual defilement of the room in five seconds flat routine. We then popped across the highway for Five Guys burgers and I went next door to Great Clips to clean up the mohawk and beard. Hit wal mart for resupply and then mosied back to the hotel. A new brewery had just opened on Main Street so we hailed a lyft after a while and went down for beer and eats. 1787 brewery was solid and we met the owner who let us taste one of the beers that we had heard much about but was still fermenting and not on tap yet. It would have hardly felt like a town day without a brewery involved. We made it back to the hotel and will get back out tomorrow, hopefully to decent temps and drier conditions. Looks like it could get hot this week.","William Penn shelter

Chef still needed to hit Walmart and I went over to the sports store to get some superfeet insoles for my new trail runners. I figured why change it up when these had worked so well on the old pair. We then met Pony and the girls over at WaWa to get sandwiches and wait for our shuttle. Craig arrived shortly thereafter and we were on our way back to the trail. Craig was a former patrolman in Hamburg and knew everyone and everything about the surrounding area or at lest talked like he did. We paid him and started our hike again but somehow completely missed the 501 Shelter where we were supposed to water up. I had lost everyone within a quarter mile so I found the next available spring and filled up before hiking on. The terrain was semi-rocky but not terrible and after 6 miles, I came upon the rest of the crew stopped at a creek crossing. The girls knew there was a pond with a rope swing on a short side trail so of course we would go down and check it out. The two of them and I did partake in a dip via the swing and the water was very brisk. It felt great once I was out but I wouldn’t be swimming too long in there. We all debated staying by the water for the night but ultimately decided we needed more than 6 miles for the day. Onward. The trail went back up to the ridge but it was a wide and forested area that had collected a load of rain water after the recent deluge. We spent several miles tromping on the side where people had formed a social trail of sorts that circumvented the flooded trail. In a couple spots, the forest on either side had been turned into a marsh and we picked through and bushwhacked the best we could, trying to keep our shoes dry. It was pretty late in the day when we made camp and we were eating around the fire ring as the sun disappeared behind the horizon and the forest trees.

I made fairly fast work of the nine miles down and descended to find it had gotten pretty damn hot. I strolled through the streets of another working class PA town and found the peanut shop where we had chosen as a rally point. I was astounded to find that it was one of the best candy shops I’d seen anywhere and only by the grace of god did I walk out of there with only a soda. I could have and should have bought at least two pounds of mix-your-own jelly belly’s. After we got the mail drop, we popped in to the Port Clinton hotel restaurant and got an overpriced and underwhelming meal. We just can’t help ourselves when it comes to town food, any opportunity must be exercised. We were dreading the hike out in the mid day heat but we had many miles yet to conquer and port Clinton was no kind of town to stay in. Reluctantly, I carried myself up the ridge out of the highway gap and back into trail zone. The afternoon miles kind of dragged on for me after being laden down with chicken wings and creamed corn nuggets. I was struggling mightily with still 6-7 miles ahead. We stopped at a couple rocky overlooks on the way and each time I removed my pack and debated staying exactly where I was for the night. The final 3 miles were painful and I stumbled like a wounded soldier into camp. Two old Russian dudes were already set up at the tent site but I was not trying to hike any further so we made do and found adequate spots to set up. Chef pressed on a bit further because he wasn’t seeing anything ideal here. After we got settled, the girls decided it was time to unburden themselves from the weight of the alcohol they had been carrying for a couple days. This included four personal wine boxes and two 375mls of bourbon. Guess who got nominated to take care of most of the bourbon? We sat around the campfire that I built and basically got shitfaced. Seemed like a totally legitimate way to cap off a 21 mile day. We were up waaaaayyyy past bedtime (1:30, possibly later) and prayed that our Russian friends would not kill us when we finally passed out. Good times.","Eagles Nest Shelter

We slowly fed ourselves and broke down camp with plans to hike 2 miles down to Eckville shelter where chef had stayed last night and there was a flushing toilet and indoor shower. The heat had set in for sure by the time I set out, it was nearly 11 already. My hope was to sweat out the booze in the next two miles and then rinse myself clean in the shower but I suspected the effects would linger well beyond that. Chef wondered at where the hell we’d been and what had taken so long, I caught him up to speed on the previous nights shenanigans. I took advantage of the toilet and shower and promptly laid down on the grassy lawn to await the others as they followed suit. The “shelter” was a bunkhouse building behind a residential home and the caretaker was a slightly gruff but accommodating guy. We delayed departure for nearly 3 hours due in part to the suffocating heat and our collective sickness. Chef seemed unfazed and went about preparing second lunch. We eventually decided that we would shoot for the first shelter available which was roughly seven miles out and a good portion climbed up the ridge again. I suffered greatly in the climb and bourbon was oozing from my pores all afternoon. The high was in the mid 90s and the heat index read that it felt like 103. Perfect. I was drawing every ounce of strength to make camp and then set up my tent and preparing dinner was a total chore.

The heat had set in early again and they expected another run at record high temps locally. It seemed like this was to be our quintessential PA sufferfest, big rock scrambles, stifling heat and more rocks. The trail is consistently filled with jagged, awkwardly placed land mines that will either stab the bottom of your foot or twist your ankle if you don’t give it your full and undivided attention. We got some very welcomed trail magic from One Sock who had posted up just before the climb up to bake oven knob. We enjoyed a cold drink and snacks in shaded camp chairs before being catapulted back in to the heat. The view from the top of bake oven Knob was unimpressive and further weakened by a ton of graffiti on the surrounding rocks. I took all of 4.5 seconds to soak in the glory of Pennsylvania’s sweeping panorama before hightailing down to the next shelter for lunch. The gang sat around the picnic table in front and bemoaned the heat. Chef had put his socks out to dry while he ate and when he picked them up, they were as stiff as cardboard. The rest of the afternoon was a bit shadier in the forest save for one more exposed rock scramble through a power line swath. I made the shelter and it’s nearby water source before descending a bit further down the trail to find a stealth site. Chef and I located a nice grassy patch a quarter mile past the spring and we estimated that we could fit seven tents there if pressed. After everyone rolled in, it turns out we could fit exactly seven tents there. Tomorrow I’ll meet up with my sister, her husband and the nephews for some 4th of July R&R.

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596819,"After hiking back up to the spring this morning to get water and doing my daily routine, I was out of camp almost thirty minutes later than I had planned. A short descent down to the highway and on the other side awaited the climb up Lehigh Gap. Known for its scrambles up large rocks, I worried I would be running close on time if this significantly slowed me down. However, after a short ascent up steep trail, the real scrambling lasted only about an eighth of a mile. I moved quickly up it and then found the dirt trail again which gained the ridge at a tolerable pitch. I laughed to myself at how overhyped this section had been and how generally the rocks in PA hadn’t been nearly as tough as advertised so far. Slightly annoying, yes but not anywhere near the hype and fearmongering. Once I was on the ridgetop again, I cruised. Save one more short dip and climb to a road gap and the rest of the morning was level terrain on decent trail. I turned on the jets to arrive at the agreed upon road gap twenty minutes early. After a slight confusion about my pick up point was clarified, the family arrived in their rental. I gave Laura and Jamie a quick hug but Cam and Everett would have none of it. Everett held his nose when I came near but they did remark on how skinny I look so I guess that’s a win. We chatted for a few minutes and thoroughly enjoyed a cold drink and then we cached a couple water containers for the tramily who would be coming up later today and needed the assist due to the very strict “no water anywhere” policy in PA. We loaded up the car and drove down to stroudsburg and I heard at least once or twice more how badly I smelled. We quickly checked in to the Hampton Inn and I picked up my care package from mad dog and val (2 kinds of homemade hot sauce in light plastic bottles). I hit the shower and then walked over to the Irish pub where they had settled in for the afternoon World Cup game. I delighted in drinking pints, eating and watching foreign soccer that I care deeply about once every four years. After, we found a small bar around the corner that would sell bottles of wine to go and supplied ourselves for the evening in the hotel. Lastly, we hit a comics and game store to pick up a board game to play for the night. I got my laundry going while they set up the board game on the outdoor patio of the hotel and I drank much red wine and played a horribly lackluster round of Catan Junior. It was way past my bedtime when we finally called the game and I still managed to stay up and chat with Laura and Jamie a while after the boys went to sleep. At least tomorrow will be a zero and I’ve insisted we do nothing strenuous.","George Outbridge Shelter

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596991,"The boys and I were up a bit after 8am and Laura and Jamie had barely stirred yet so I took Cam and E downstairs to eat breakfast. We grabbed a table outside and navigated through the busy breakfast buffet. Laura and Jamie joined us a little while later and we thought we’d go over to Delaware water gap and see about getting in the river today. A quick call to the outfitter verified that they had availability for the afternoon. It was only a 5 minute drive over and we first popped into the outfitter store where I was able to get my trekking poles re-tipped as the original ones were worn down to nubs. I also grabbed another Sawyer big bag for collecting water to filter since my first one had finally sprung a leak. 1000+ miles of use for anything tends to ruin it, I’m learning. We crossed over to the river shop and started to get signed up for some duckies (rubber kayaks) for the day. I snagged a twelve pack of Coors light from the pizza place across the street because that’s what freedom is for. They got us squared away with life jackets and everybody got on the bus for the 15 minute ride out to the put-in. As we were about to shove off, a local news crew from Scranton asked to interview me about my 4th of July plans. I obliged and gave them probably the most compelling 2 minute interview ever. People in Scranton are surely still talking about it. We shoved off and enjoyed a nice leisurely float down the river. Jamie and Everett teamed up in a larger kayak and the rest of us paddled our own. We enjoyed sunny skies and the green forested banks slid lazily past as we slowly bobbed downstream. We pulled off a couple times to enjoy a pebbly beach and get an obligatory “Crossing the Delaware” photo in a very patriotic nod to old GW. Near the end of the float, the thunderheads started to roll in  and with them a most frustrating upstream wind. The lazy float turned into work as we had to start paddling hard to keep from being pushed back by the wind. The clouds started to look like business so we really dug in for the last mile to get off before things got worse. Camden did not enjoy the last bit of the day much and I can’t say I did either. Nothing frustrates a thru-hiker more than any kind of physical exertion on an off day. We hopped the van back to the outfitter and after switching into dry clothes we went over to the Sycamore Grill for dinner. I opted for a penne chicken dish and it was aces and gone quickly. Ibex and show pony had arrived around then and we walked back down to the bakery to meet them and introduce the tramily to family. We would sadly miss glow stick and chef though, she had stopped early after not feeling well and chef had already been picked up by his family for some days off in NY. Since ibex an pony were looking for options to stay for the night, I suggested the Hampton over in stroudsburg. Monica (now Moss) was with them and a four way split sounded pretty good for another hotel night. I wasn’t probably getting back to the trail until tomorrow so I was content to live the town life a bit longer. I made arrangements with the hotel and went with the family up to Zoe’s for ice cream in an old fashioned parlor with all the authentic touches. I polished off my malt and the latter half of Cam’s sundae and then they gave me a lift back over to the hotel in stroudsburg. Since they have to fly early out of Newark, they’ll stay closer to there tonight. We said our goodbyes and the visit felt far too short but we still managed to cram some quality fun in with what time we had. I went up to the room and the other three showed soon and we all walked over to Siamsa (the Irish pub) for dinner. Unsurprisingly, the Irish pub was quiet tonight being that it’s the 4th. The patriots in town were drinking in parking lots, setting off cheap fireworks. We didn’t have much energy for revelry and headed back to the hotel after dinner to make it an early night. The occasional pop/flash from outside the hotel window would not be enough to keep us up late.","Stroudsburg PA

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596997,"We were in no great hurry to get going in the morning and we walked down to get breakfast. Ibex had bought fresh fruit for the Belgian waffles because that’s now a firm tradition. It was a total zoo at the buffet and I gave up waiting for the waffle maker and opted instead to eat my weight in Cap’n Crunch. We lingered until check out and then walked over to the outfitter. They were good enough to swap out my second pair of Darn Tough socks, gotta love that lifetime warranty. We grabbed a Lyft back into Delaware Water Gap and the others poked around in the outfitter before heading over to the bakery where glow stick had just rolled in. Realizing that I’d need some resupply before making my way back on trail, I hopped in another car with glow stick and pathfinder who were going over to WalMart. Since it was a cheaper fare back to where I needed to get from there, it made sense. I shopped for many of the usual items and repacked my bag outside while the others finished. They called a car to get back to the trail in Delaware water gap and I called a separate one to get me back to the road gap where I’d left off on the 3rd. It felt so strange knowing that I’d likely be hiking solo for a few days, really for the first time since my first day on trail. I started hiking and made decent time despite my late afternoon start. I remembered someone had highly recommended the Gateway motel in Wind Gap as it was pretty inexpensive and had been recently remodeled. That coupled with heavy predicted rain tonight and I was already sold, so much for roughing it solo. I called ahead and arranged for a room and the owner told me to just let myself in when I arrived. I walked around from the road gap, found the motel and my room which was unlocked. The owner arrived a few minutes later and offered me a cold bottled water and invited me into the office to get squared away. He also asked for my help in correcting the contact number for the motel on Google pages. I got it figured out for him and then ordered a Dominoes pizza for delivery and had a shower. This would also be the first time I’d had a room to myself in the trail and I must say it was pretty great. I gorged on pizza and candy and soda and watched Seinfeld and Office reruns in my boxers. Doesn’t get much better than that. I’ll hit Delaware Water Gap tomorrow (for real this time) and be done with Pennsylvania.","Stroudsburg PA

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597102,"Since it was supposed to rain until early afternoon and the motel owner said I could stay as long as I felt like today, I took my sweet ass time getting out. Had one more shower before finally lighting out at 12:30. After the steep climb out of the road gap back up to the ridge, I mostly cruised and was descending upon Delaware Water Gap by late afternoon. First stop was Zoe’s for more ice cream, this time a coffee milkshake that I downed quickly. Across the street and down a tenth of a mile was the Heart of the Mountain Presbyterian church perched up on a high grassy lawn, the high point of the quaint Main Street that runs through town. They offered bunks on a donation basis so I figured it would be a good option since lower overnight temps are expected. I grabbed one of the last top bunks and said hello to a couple other hikers before grabbing a quick shower. After, I walked across the street to the sycamore grill as I knew they had a bar and it was roughly happy hour time. Sure enough, dollar off beers until 7 meant I had time for two before the special ended. I stayed for nachos (and a few more beers) and wound up talking a while with Yodi, a northbounder who knows a couple other hikers I’d met back in VA and was still trying to catch up with them. He’s from the NE and was pretty excited to be getting to that part of the trail again despite having hiked most of it already or maybe because he knows it’s great. I continue to get more and more pumped about the mountainous terrain of the final three states even though I’ve got hundreds of miles to cover first. I chatted with the bartenders for a bit too and eventually closed out and headed back to the church hostel. Debating what to do tomorrow, the hostel allows up to two night stays and I kinda dig this little town. Really feeling like I should get the hell out of PA but it’s tempting to stay.","Wind Gap PA

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597104,"I’m a bum, I’ll admit it. Can’t use my sore feet as an excuse or just general exhaustion from the grind of PA, I woke up today and just didn’t feel like hiking. So I won’t. I slept in late even by my standards and it felt really good to get the extra rest. I walked down the hill to the bakery and got a huge donut and breakfast sandwich and then went back up to the hostel to relax. Talked with some other hikers who were hanging out including Odie (not to be confused with Yodi) of the Hiker Yearbook fame. He had the little yellow school bus out back and was shuttling hikers to Walmart and helping people slackpack up the trail to where there was trail magic going on. I knew that there was a World Cup match on at 2 so I once again returned to the sycamore and posted up. Nothing so fine as a decent bar pouring cold beer while watching sports. My zero felt like the right call. I also spotted sunshine at the end of the bar and went and sat with her for a while. She had gotten off trail after breaking a toe hiking in Chaco sandals and was now on the second pair of shoes trying to get going again on something that didn’t kill her feet. She said it’s been a struggle and she’s debated leaving the trail for good quite a few times. I told her to give NJ a try now that PA is over and after a few beers I think she was feeling more positive about the prospect of pushing on. We ate happy hour apps and then closed out and walked down to the pizza place to get to-go food for later. She also grabbed some stealthy beers for her tent since the church obviously didn’t want alcohol or drugs in the hostel. I decided to abstain from more drinking since I would actually have to hike on tomorrow despite my best efforts to apparently never leave Pennsylvania ever. We walked back up to the hostel and there was another group of hikers in for the night and I ate my sandwich and chatted with them briefly before passing out on the couch while trying to read. I put myself to bed and will do my utmost to finally get out of here in the morning.","DWG

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597320,"I awoke today and realized that, in one form or another, this was my fifth consecutive day in Delaware Water Gap. It was most definitely time to get out of this vortex and put PA behind me for good. But first, breakfast at the bakery, obviously. After I’d eaten, I ran into Tab who’d just arrived in town, he was stunned that he’d caught up to us but I explained it was just me at the moment and I was heading back out. He was waiting for a package at the post office until tomorrow so he’s going to be behind again. I was organizing my things back up at the church hostel when Odie walked in and said he was driving his bus up to the trail magic about 10 miles up the trail. He offered to drive any of my gear up so that I’d have a lighter load hiking this morning. Yes please. I whittled the pack down to just day hiking essentials and threw the rest in his bus. I definitely planned on partaking in the bbq put on by Riff Raff later this afternoon so this worked well. I finally started hiking again and as I left town, I crossed the Delaware river and the New Jersey state line. Happy to have PA behind me, I made my way around the bend and started the gradual climb back up into the forested ridge. The rocks of PA were still present here and I had to keep my attention on the ground for most of the afternoon to avoid tripping or twisting something. The ten miles went by smoothly and after ascending to a nice view of a very lush green Jersey skyline, I was descending to the road gap where the trail magic was happening. It was pretty standard fare, which is to say totally amazing for a hungry hiker. Grilled burgers and dogs, corn on the cob, pasta dishes, fresh fruit, and cold drinks (including beer). I lingered for almost two hours and after I had repacked my full load and thanked Odie for the assist, I begrudgingly marched on to find a camp. After 5ish miles, I ran into Flamingo who I’d bumped into frequently as of late and we decided to push one more mile to a camp a bit further on the ridge. It was getting close to sunset when we finally arrived and found suitable ground for our tents, we cooked dinner as the sun dipped behind the horizon and were able to use a bear bag hang already set up by Grey Ghost. It’s a little strange camping without the tramily but I should be able to reconnect with Chef and Ibex in the next day or two and glow stick and pony shortly after.","DWG PA

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597688,"I kinda overslept this morning, it was cool and I didn’t hear the others leave camp so i was by myself eating breakfast and breaking down. I had a long day ahead if I was going to meet back up with Ibex this evening so I would have to keep a good pace and have shorter breaks. Thankfully the terrain was pretty easy and the trail mostly stuck to the top of the ridge line without much elevation drop or gain. The main problem today was water. The recent heat has dried up most springs and streams and the only reliable source was a spring down by Brink Road Shelter about halfway into my hike. I’d read some comments on my Guthook app about heavy mosquitos down there but nothing could have prepared me for the situation. I had hiked down the short side trail to the shelter and used the privy by the shelter before searching for the spring. The water was a bit deeper into the woods and it was absolutely thick with aggressive bugs. When I found the spring, I propped my water bag under the flow to collect and then proceeded to run up and down the trail swatting like a crazy person at the onslaught of hungry skeeters. When the bag was full, I ran back to my pack and proceeded to jog back up to the main trail. A gang of them had stayed with me all the way back up and I was still swinging and cursing as I got strapped up to start hiking again. Flamingo walked up and asked how bad it was and I advised her to proceed with caution and speed. She threw on her bug net and long sleeves before attempting the water run, smart move. The rest of the afternoon was easy hiking and I had been in touch with ibex about meeting up at the Mashipacong Shelter this evening. Since she was getting dropped off by Zach at a parking lot about 3 miles before the shelter, I asked her to cache some water there so I could re-up for the night and tomorrow morning. She made the drop and I was able to get topped up before making the final three miles to camp. She was already there having dinner and we swapped stories from our time off the trail in recent days. We also chatted with The Lady and Mad Libs (from CO) who were also eating dinner at the picnic table outside the shelter. Ibex and I made a rough plan for the next few days and how we would tentatively meet up with the rest of the group. Chef would hopefully be catching up in the next day or two and we would see glow stick shortly after she got back from her time at Wine Fest. It’s good to be getting the band back together.","Ridge campsite

The first 5.5 miles up there were easy and the day was already starting to get warm. At the welcome center, they give hikers a free Pepsi, I guess to discourage people from visiting. I drank it anyway and then hiked another half mile up to the lake. I passed under the impressive stone obelisk that marks the high point of NJ, something like 1800 feet. Pshhhhh. I found ibex down by the shore of the lake which was teeming with little kids and families. We still took advantage of the water and went for a dip before sunning on the grass and having lunch. There was a concession stand so we also grabbed a couple gatorades. We still had 13+ miles to make so we got moving again and the afternoon kinda dragged on. The terrain was slightly undulating but not too steep and it wasn’t all that hot but I just wasn’t feeling my strongest. We passed through farmland and swamps before we slipped over the NY border momentarily late in the afternoon. I discovered a hidden trail to a convenience store as described by someone on my Guthook app and we took advantage of that to pop in for yet another Gatorade for camp tonight. The afternoon had heated up and I also downed a coke and ice cream sandwich. Once back on trail, we had a long hike around a swampy nature preserve before a super steep climb up the ridge to the shelter. There was an abandoned house owned by the park service just off trail that was known to have a working water spigot so we cameled up there just before the ascent. Water options in Jersey seem to be either a bog or bog outlet, swamp or swamp outlet, or marsh/marsh outlet. It’s making our water stops far more strategic than in the past. We made the shelter and set up our tents and got dinner going while chatting with Noodles and Sara who we’d met in Harpers Ferry. They started their hike then and will flip flop back southbound after they get to Maine. Ibex really wants to watch England play in the World Cup tomorrow so we may look for a motel option in the afternoon to do that. It’ll also give Chef a chance to catch up since he is a bit behind us.","Mashipacong Shelter

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598816,"Ibex and I had discussed the possibility of catching the England/Croatia semifinal World Cup game and decided we would make it our mission to see it one way or another. Our best bet was going to be the road gap near Vernon which was only 6.5 miles out. We left early enough that the hike there would put us in before noon. The morning was mostly downhill through the pine forest before a boardwalk through some heavy swamp land. She arrived at the road ahead of me and had walked over to the Heaven Hills farm store to wait. They had ice cream so we indulged some of that while we contemplated our next move. There were a couple of winery/cidery places nearby but we couldn’t find an Uber or lyft to get there. We found that the Appalachian motel just down the road did offer a free pickup and they had cable in the rooms. We grabbed a couple bottles of wine from the store inside and called the motel to get picked up. The owner came right down and we were soon checked in, showered, and drinking wine while the game started. We also found some local Chinese delivery so that we wouldn’t have to go anywhere for a bit. The Chinese was good, England lost and we caught a slight buzz. After the game, we paid the owner of the motel to shuttle us over to the supermarket for resupply and got the necessities plus a few more beers before having her drive us back. We lounged the rest of the evening at the motel watching a South Park marathon and drinking beer. Kind of an unnecessary Nero today but worth it to get resuppied and enjoy the creature comforts. We should be able to get into NY tomorrow and hopefully Chef will be soon caught up again.","Pochuck Shelter

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598822,"In typical fashion, we delayed departure until around checkout and got shuttled back to the trail around 10am. We knew we had a fairly sizable day ahead and some steepish terrain so we got into a rhythm right away. The last spring for a while was halfway up the first ridge climb and we took advantage of the good water. The day was a constant roller coaster of short but steep descents and ascents over rocky ledges in the forest. It was pretty fun terrain but it required more physical effort than straight hiking, I was using upper body strength to maneuver some climbing moves that you rarely see on the trail. After the ridge reached a higher point and the trail followed along the top, we crossed the NJ/NY border around 2:30. There were some decent viewpoints from up there and ibex and I found a shaded area to break for lunch. We still had some decent mileage to make and had planned to stop at Bellvale creamery for late afternoon treats so we got moving again. The trail stayed high on solid rock for a while and there were fantastic views down to Greenwood Lake. It looked like an idyllic lake resort town and we regretted not having pushed bigger miles early yesterday to post up in a hotel there for the World Cup game. Oh well, can’t hit em all. I made it to the road crossing for the creamery and walked a short ways down there to find a couple other hikers and an entire tour bus load of a Latin church group. I stood in line, the only person not dressed on Sunday best and stinking of sweat. The wait was worth it though, I had a shake and vanilla cream soda that were amazing after the hot day of hiking. Ibex arrived not long after and a little while after, chef came rolling in. Since we were a little while in conversing and lounging, I went back in for a root beer float. I also had a couple beers and some baby carrots courtesy of a local trail angel that had passed through. We decided to hit the next shelter a couple miles up for the night and made it up there just as it was getting dark. I was furiously swatting at mosquitoes while setting up my tent and since I’d had a dinner of ice cream and baby carrots, I opted to call it a night without cooking, a most adult decision.","Vernon NJ

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599371,"For the first time on trail, I had breakfast inside my tent because the mosquitoes might have killed me otherwise. I got back on the trail and started a day of PUDs (pointless ups and downs) in the rising heat. It would be another day of tricky water options as the recent heat waves had dried up many seasonal water sources and I’d be pushing more liquid under the hot sun. Luckily, local trail angels are keen to this problem and at almost every road gap we would find gallons cached for water bottle refills. I have no idea how we would’ve made it through the day without their help. We stopped for lunch at a high point that looked down on the interstate and I could only be there long enough to scarf down lunch, it was too hot to bear otherwise. Ibex and chef were still lounging around when I started off again and we planned to rendezvous at Lake Tiorati where there was swimming and vending machines within the state park just off trail. The afternoon had more tough climbs and a feature called the lemon squeezer where I was barely able to wriggle through the narrow stone crevasse with my pack. I made the lake after a quarter mile walk down the side road and found a plug in to charge my phone at a picnic table near the vending machines. I got in the water just as the others rolled in and they had discovered a local pizza joint that would deliver to the lake. Dinner! They also grabbed a dip and I took advantage of the shower to rinse myself off and some of my clothes. I hung those up to dry in the sun and we waited for the pizza. We each had ordered a full large pie and of course Chef took his down in one sitting. Ibex and I packed out our leftover slices and after filling up water, we hiked on to find a campsite nearby. About a mile past the park, up on a ridge covered with blueberry bushes, we found some suitable flat space to stealth camp.

It sustained me for the entire morning and into the early afternoon. The hike was pretty demanding and it was another hot day. The climb up Bear Mt crossed the 1400 mile marker and there were throngs of weekend hikers around the summit when I got up there. A vending machine provided a much needed Powerade and I checked out the panorama from atop the observation tower for a minute before deciding to book down to the park down below where concessions awaited. I cruised past a tour group that marveled at the novelty of a thru hiker and got a lot of strange looks from day walkers, probably wondering why I would need trekking poles for a paved path. It was an absolute crush of humanity when I reached the lake park at the base of the mountain, I’m talking thousands of people. Every square inch of picnic ground was occupied by families bbqing and my head was spinning from the flurry of activity around me. I grabbed a Gatorade and corn dog at the concession and made quick work of that before walking on. The trail passes through the lakeside park before going through a public pool area that is free to thru hikers. I took one look down at the throng of screaming kids and just kept right on going. Next, the trail went through the bear Mt zoo which is a sad little place with animals that are injured and rehabilitating. I sat down near the bear exhibit (the low elevation point on the trail) to check my texts and see where ibex and chef were. Not getting an immediate response, I made the decision to hike on. It was too hot to stay down here and the crowd-weaving was giving me a bit of anxiety. The original plan for the evening was to hit a camp about 4 miles past the park but since it didn’t have water and there was a roadside deli a couple miles further, that was a no brainer. I filled up my empty water bottle from the drinking fountain at the zoo and pressed on. The trail crossed a toll bridge over the Hudson River with really incredible views and then pitched steeply uphill on the other side of the gorge. I toiled up and stopped to take a drink. The water from the zoo tasted like an absolute swamp and I nearly gagged. I had less than a liter left in my other bottle, so I would have to ration that until I made the deli. The rest of the way wasn’t so bad after I crested the ridge and I still hadn’t heard from the others so I kept going. I got to the deli and took my time with a sandwich and a couple tall boy beers. There is a spiritual center less than a mile up the trail that allows tenting on their athletic field so I made my way there and set up just as it was getting dark. Heavy rain started at about 10pm and I discovered that my top seam was leaking a bit. I spent the next hour and a half holding my camp towel against the problem area while the rain came down in torrents. Will need to get some seam sealer soon because apparently we are in for more rainy weather in the days ahead. Just after I had fallen asleep, my phone started crazily buzzing with text messages from throughout the day. Chef and ibex had stopped at the earlier campsite and thought I had disappeared from the trail.

What looked to be a day-long soccer tournament was taking shape and I was feeling out of place a bit. There were booths being set up, uniformed soccer players going through pregame warm-ups and an insane amount of chicken being grilled under the far veranda. One of the Hispanic guys setting up asked me in rough English if I lived there while I was eating breakfast under the pavilion. I laughed and said no, just here for the one night but judging by all of the activity, was starting to wish I could stay. I started my hike and planned on hitting the Canopus lake state park for the evening. There is free tenting there in a field and they have swimming and concessions near the beach. Ibex and chef were uncertain if they would make it that far and they were also probably waiting up for glow stick who was back on trail after her weekend at wine fest. I made good time over fairly easy terrain and made the beach around 4:30. The grill at the concession was open still so I got a chicken sandwich and fries. I went back in before they closed at 6 and grabbed an ice cream and they offered me the remainder of the fries they had left over as they were closing up which I gladly accepted. After a shower at the beach restroom, I found the tenting area behind the parking lots and set up. There was no one else there yet and I sat at the picnic table and enjoyed a tall boy that I’d packed out from the deli yesterday. I’ll be alone this evening again and it sounds like the others will make it here around 10 tomorrow.

I conversed with some other thru hikers that I’d not yet met and the others came in after I’d crawled into my tent at dark. We will be meeting up with Chefs folks tomorrow at a road crossing and they are graciously hosting us at their home in Redhook for the next couple nights. ","Canopus Lake

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599390,"The deli was open for breakfast so of course I grabbed a breakfast burrito, mini donuts and juice and coffee before breaking camp. The afternoon was supposed to get stormy so I wasted no time on the day’s hike. I kept an eye on the hourly forecast and knew I needed to book it to stay dry which is exactly what I did. I emerged to the Wingdale road gap where the only train stop on the AT sits. I chatted briefly with a day hiker who was curious about my trek and took my photo and then I hustled a half mile up the road to a deli just as the rain began in earnest, thank god for the conveniently placed delis in the state of NY which have lately been a stand-in for shelters on the trail. I ordered a sandwich and Glow stick showed up right after. Ibex and chef had not quite beat the weather and they were hiding out under a gazebo near the road crossing until chefs dad came and scooped them up before coming to grab me and Glow. We drove 45 minutes out to his folks farm and talked with his dad along the way, him quizzing us about the trail and us grilling him on Chefs youth and upbringing. Their home out is a beautiful old farmhouse originally built in the late 1700s and we were greeted there by his mom, brother and two dogs. They welcomed us right in and we had beers and showers going in no time. His mom had graciously prepared a huge spread of burgers, salads, corn on the cob and all kinds of snacks. We all chatted after dinner and doted on the dogs, Diesel, a nine year old German Shepherd and Blackjack, a six year old mutt that used to be one of chefs boar hunting dogs in Hawaii before retiring to the farm life with his folks. The plan tomorrow is to catch a ride back to the trailhead with chefs brother and slackpack until his dad can pick us up in the afternoon at Kent, CT. Hopefully we will also meet up with Pony tomorrow and get him back in the tramily after he had stopped for a visit in NYC.","RT 52 Deli

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599394,"Other than the dogs barking at coyotes last night, we slept well and Chef himself made an omelette and bacon breakfast for us before we hopped in the truck to get out to the trailhead for a slackpacking day. We felt pretty clever about being inside last night as the rain had continued overnight and we encountered a number of familiar faces on the trail that had been soaked from it. The hiking was good and the sun was out so we made good miles with less weight on our backs. Near midday, we crossed into CT and left NY in the rear view. The early impression of CT was a good one with nice rivers and forest to admire and the day rolled by smoothly. At the road crossing just above Kent, we found Show Pony and collected him for the ride back out to the farm when chefs dad arrived at the end of the day. When we got back to the farm, we donned swimwear to get a little bit of pool time as the afternoon sun slipped behind the trees. Pony initially griped about taking a nearo to wait for us but quickly came around after a dip and a beer. Diesel entertained us by racing laps around the pool and jumping over the diving board any time someone was about to hop in. We may have to take diesel with us when we leave because he is the funniest dog ever and we can tell he will miss us terribly.  Chefs mom made another fantastic dinner of bbq pork cutlets and grilled peaches along with all the side fixings like last night. This kind of living is sure to spoil us but how can we pass it up? We plan on getting in another day of slackpacking tomorrow courtesy of chefs mom. ","NY RT 22

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600412,"Slept well again in a bed and was awoken in the middle of the night by the dogs barking at coyotes-again. Chef repeated his breakfast prep for us and we had eggs made to order. His mom drove us back out to the trailhead and we agreed on a pick up time after a 16 mile day. The sun was out and the terrain was a mixed bag, hilly in the morning then very flat for a four mile stretch before more hill climbs in the afternoon. I kept a good pace and just snacked out of my pockets instead of stopping for full lunch. Chef texted us around noon that he had bumped our pick up time forward an hour since the terrain was faster than anticipated and this way we’d have more pool time back at his parents house. We all made the road gap by around 3pm but the girls were perturbed that they had been made to hurry in order to get there on time. We loaded back into the family car and headed back out to the farm, donned swimwear and enjoyed more pool time with beers in hand. Chef said that we should probably get back on the trail full-time tomorrow and we all agreed that we had taken up enough of his parents space and grocery bill for the last few days and it was time to get going again. His folks were nice enough to order us pizzas tonight and we gratefully chowed down once more. We tried to get rid of as many beers as we could but it was clear that we wouldn’t finish the ample supply that they’d bought for our visit and eventually we called it an evening but not before taking a tramily photo while wearing matching sweatshirts from Chefs former company. Back out to the woods tomorrow after being spoiled rotten by Chef’s generous parents.","Kent CT

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600778,"Enjoyed one more night of sound sleep in a bed and then prepared ourselves to leave the farm and get back out on the trail. As we were just about to get going, my Amazon package was delivered, some seam sealer for my tent to keep the top from leaking again. Only problem was that it was a spray can and not the smaller bottle I had hoped for, apparently I didn’t read the package size closely enough. I crammed the full can into the top of my pack and will have to spray the tent in camp tonight and dispose of the spray can later. That, combined with the few beers I was packing out on the insistence of chefs parents, made for a bulky and heavy load. After Chefs mom drove us by the grocery store for food resupply, I was hating myself as I strapped up once back at the trailhead. We thanked Chef’s mom once more for everything and began the hike up from the road. Given our afternoon start, we planned to only do about 10 miles before setting up for the evening. The hike was generally manageable terrain and I didn’t suffer to greatly for my overburdened pack. After passing a set of waterfalls, we searched for a stealth site that had been described on the Guthook app. It took some scrambling and pond hopping to get there but were able to find suitable tent space for all. It was super buggy up there and despite having beers to drink, we deemed it a not ideal night to party in the forest. Zach came out for the weekend to see ibex and we assured him that we’d find a more suitable spot tomorrow night and get wild in the woods. Guess that means I’m carrying a few more beers until then. Also sprayed my tent with the seam sealer, hope that does the trick to get me to the end of the trail with dry sleeping quarters.","Cornwall Rd

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600779,"Slept somewhat chilly with only my bag liner and continue to think I should get my quilt sent back to me. Popped outside my tent to find that the dried seam sealer made my it look like it had been bombarded with bird shit weeks ago and I just never bothered to wash it off. Nice. As long as the stuff works, right? We hiked out and embarked on a substantial day that would see us hit both the 1500 mile marker and the jump from CT into MA. Milestones all around! The hike took us over a nice view on Bear Mt and through Sage’s Ravine before another climb up and along a rocky ridge with views for days. We found a suitable campsite with reasonable water access fairly deep down in the woods and set up for what was predicted to be a rainy night. We finally got to have our tramily forest party and it was a great night. Music was played, dancing was did, hugs were had. The rain held off mercifully until we were all in our tents later.

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600781,"Felt surprisingly OK this morning after the revelry last night, if maybe a bit cloudy. That mindset matched the weather which was all drizzle and fog. Hiked up and over Mt Everett and found a cooler full of iced tea trail magic on the other side. Kept pushing through the morning and ran into Ibex and zach who had met up with her mom and brother for a day of family slackpacking. They had bought us each a scone from the bakery in Great Barrington which I happily chowed down. Had to essentially run through a couple of thickly forested sections that had some of the hungriest and most aggressive mosquitoes I have seen yet. I’ve lost count of the number of blood splats I’ve created by smashing a skeeter, each time yelling, “Was it worth it, you bastard?!” or some similar variation. The final 5 miles up to the shelter was tough today and I was stumbling a bit too much by the time I finally got in around sundown, never a good thing.Pony had made it there too but the other three didn’t show and have presumably laid up early to tent. With more heavy rain expected tonight, we are contented to hold up in the loft of the shelter and keep our selves and gear dry. ","Race Brook

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600784,"The rain hammered pretty good a couple times last night and I was happy to be under the shelter roof. The morning was cloud soup but not raining even though we knew to expect more later today. I’d made a commitment to be in Dalton, MA in two days to help my tenants figure out an issue with the air conditioning in my condo, so I needed to make big miles to get there. The hike was only an hour under way when the skies opened up again and the rain came down hard. Pony and I hiked through the misery most of the day and alternated between laughing maniacally and groaning with contempt for the weather. There was a roadside stand with help-yourself sodas and Gatorade so we stopped there to recharge for the next couple hill climbs. The afternoon drug on and we conversed about our resolve to finish the trail, favorite stand-up comics and various other topics. We made Goose Pond Cabin a little after seven and even though the bunks were all full, the caretaker offered us the floor in the living room in front of the fireplace. We agreed that would beat tenting out in the wet weather and happily laid out sleeping pads after everyone had gone up to bed. Would have loved to have been here a bit longer and with better weather but it’s not to be. Will push another big day tomorrow to get down to Dalton and hopefully grab a motel room for an evening.","Tom Leonard Shelter
",Upper Goose Pond,"Jul 23, Mon",21.10
Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605876,"We awoke early as we had set up in front of the fireplace and began to stir so soon as the first couple people were up and about. Upper Goose Pond cabin is known for serving pancakes to hikers and I looked forward to cooked breakfast. Unfortunately, there were so many hikers here last night that the process of getting pancakes made was suuuuper slow. I waited about 30 minutes for just one pancake and realized that getting full would take longer than I'd like to wait to leave. We had a fairly big day to get into Dalton and the allure of town was enough to make us scarf down some of our own boring provisions so that we could get back on the trail. We filled up on water from the jugs graciously provided by the caretaker, said our thanks and were on our way. The morning was overcast but starting to clear and the day looked promising weather-wise at least until later in the afternoon. Pony and I made our way up a few decent climbs and through some soggy trail and stopped for lunch at a shelter with about half the hike still ahead of us. Sometime after lunch, Pony and I separated and I put in some music to help the miles go by. The sun stayed out and I got closer and closer to town as my energy steadily dwindled. A couple miles before town there was one more significant elevation climb that kicked my ass and then it was a smooth downhill the rest of the way. Just before I broke the treeline before town, a massive tree came down in the forest above me, probably only 100 feet away. I stood in awe and watched the destruction of the falling giant and wondered if it had been much closer, how I might've reacted. I didn't ponder it too long as there was an ice cream shop just inside town limits and I had a milkshake on the mind. I arrived there to see a few other hikers I didn't know and sat down to inhale my well-earned treat. Pony arrived shortly thereafter and after he ate, we hailed an Uber to take us a couple miles over to the Econo Lodge. I failed to mention that Chef and Glow Stick had leapfrogged us yesterday by hiking into the night and arriving in town hours ahead of us this morning. They were posted up at the hotel already and Pony and I joined them. There was no pool even though one had been advertised and this was obviously crushing. Instead, we did the traditional stop-in to Five Guys and grabbed some beers to sip on while we waited for Ibex who was still hiking in. Eventually we were all reunited and went over to Friendly's for a late dinner of sandwiches and ice cream. I also learned that the full repair for the A/C in my apartment in Denver was going to be prohibitively expensive so I started pricing other options. Such a headache to have to deal with real life when on the trail but apparently the world is still turning without me so I'll have to get that figured out. Tomorrow we will hike out but in no great hurry, I'm sure.","Upper Goose Pond

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605877,"The continental breakfast at the Econo Lodge was underwhelming to say the least and we argued over the day's proposed mileage, as we often do. Glow Stick was adamant that 13.5 miles was unreasonable but of course, I didn't. We decided we would go about getting ourselves ready to get back on trail and see what did seem reasonable once we were under way. We pushed our checkout time til almost noon before heading over to the grocery store/Walmart. Chef, Pony, and I decided to stuff our faces with Taco Bell for lunch and then we got a lift back to the trail in Dalton proper (our motel was actually in Pittsfield). It was almost 3pm by the time we were heading north again and the 13 miles I had proposed did seem somewhat ambitious at this point. My concern was with the rain that was forecast overnight and the best way to avoid it was a shelter. It was already spitting rain as I hiked into the woods on the other side of town and I hoofed it to make my way into the town of Cheshire about 7 miles out. I made good time there but not good enough to make the little sandwich shop on the main drag before they closed. Glow and Ibex were already there at a picnic table as they had left Dalton before we did. There was a Shell station just up the road, so I blasted ahead and told them to meet me there when they were ready to head out. Once I made it to the Shell, I sat down to scarf an Italian sub and an iced coffee and the others eventually staggered in. It was getting later now and I had probably less than 2 hours of light left to make over 6 miles (mostly uphill) to the shelter. I checked the weather again and the rain was supposed to get heavy after dark and stay heavy through the night. The others said they doubted that they would be willing to push that far before dark and would likely look to camp just a couple miles up the trail. We agreed to meet in the morning up on Mt Greylock and I hastened out the door to make some distance. I pushed myself about as hard as I had to date and kept up a strong pace despite the consistent elevation gain. I had made over 3 miles in an hour when the light started to fade, I was able to see well enough in the clearings but when the trail dipped back in to the forest, I had to put on my headlamp to see the trail. There was so much condensation in the air that it reflected thickly around my head and prevented the light from letting me see much beyond my feet. As darkness gathered and the moisture felt more and more imminent, I had some concern about missing the spur trail to the shelter. Things were wet enough that I couldn't pull out my phone to use Guthook and therefore couldn't verify my exact location. My paranoia didn't last long as I finally reached the trail intersection and scurried down the .1 mile side trail. I spotted the bear box on the way in to camp and immediately stowed my food so I wouldn't have to deal with it in the morning. There were only two others in the shelter and already in bed so I quietly set up on one of the bottom bunks and climbed in to bed. The rain started in earnest between 9 and 10 and I was very glad to have pushed by myself to get here. Hopefully the rest of the crew doesn't float away. ","Dalton MA

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605945,"It was still super cloudy and spitting rain when I woke up. Knowing the others were still several miles down the mountain, I was in no great hurry to get an early start. When it became apparent that the sky wasn't going to clear anytime soon, I decided to get up to the summit of Greylock where there is a lodge with food service which beats sitting in a rainy shelter any day. The climb up was somewhat demanding and the trail was really wet in places but I was feeling good on fresh legs and it wasn't long before I had picked my way up through the forest and to the rise of Mount Greylock, highest point in Massachusetts. The summit holds an impressive stone observation tower but with the thick fog, I opted to cruise directly over to the lodge and wait for the others there. It was fairly quiet inside and I set my pack down and grabbed a sandwich and soda from the kitchen which had just opened for the day. There were a few books out in the lobby, so I thumbed through one and felt only slightly guilty for planting my hiker scent on the nice leather sofa. There really wasn't anyone around to object, so I was fine with it. After maybe an hour and a half, the others strolled in, slightly soggy from the hike up but in good spirits. We returned to the kitchen so they could eat and we ran into a thru-hiker from last season that had driven up this morning with trail magic in tow. We went out to her car and picked through some nice snack offerings and chatted with them. The sun was starting to peek out in places by now and we knew we should take advantage of any window to hike dry, so we filled up water bottles and started down the other side of the mountain, swinging by the observation tower first.The descent was pretty quick and the sun stayed out and we were further motivated by yet another rumored trail magic up ahead that we'd heard tell of yesterday outside of Cheshire. Sure enough, at the dirt road gap below, a cooler and box had been left with sodas, fruit, various cookie packages, and a bag of Mcdonald's cheeseburgers. I partook and rested for a few minutes and Pony showed up not long after. We pushed off again and it was later in the afternoon when we descended down to the town of North Adams and from there an impressive view behind us of Mt Greylock. The trail walked along a street and crossed a couple of others as it cut through town before leaving again by cutting right in between two homes and re-entering the forest again. The terrain was pretty steadily uphill and even got to a point of rock scrambling before topping out on a semi-rocky ridge. I was motivated to get to the next shelter for a couple reasons: both mile marker 1600 and the MA/VT border were between here and there. The sun was beginning to slip through the trees when I reached the sign marking the state line and the beginning of the Long Trail. This was the trail that originally inspired the AT and it traverses the entire state of VT. I was psyched to be entering the final 3 states as I've heard so many hikers say that these are the three best on the trail, each one more impressive than the last. I was also feeling the exhilaration of the challenge that lay ahead. The trail ahead will get progressively more demanding and will stay tough until we reach the 100 Mile Wilderness in Maine. Or so I'm told.I arrived to the shelter just as dusk was settling in and found Chef there getting set up. I got my tent up and made a water run down to the creek and by the time I had finished dinner, it was full dark. The plan for tomorrow is to hike the ten-ish miles down to Bennington where Chef's mom has graciously reserved us a motel room. The girls will presumably be a few hours behind as they didn't make it as far as the shelter this evening. We will all reconvene down in town tomorrow whenever we can all get there.","Mark Noepel Shelter

Peppermint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605946,"The weather stayed dry overnight and the morning looked nice when I started down the trail. The terrain between camp and town was pretty simple with a few minor pitches before finally descending steeply down to the highway. I made it down behind Chef who had presumably already caught a ride in and Pony and I were able to squeeze into a truck with a couple other hikers who had hitched from a couple locals headed down to town. They were nice enough to drop us in the motel lot where we met up with Chef and got checked in. Since the girls would be a while longer hiking in, we opted to cross the street over to Pizza Hut and do terrible things to their lunch buffet. We lounged around the motel room and did laundry while watching cable and sipping on beers acquired from the grocery store. Though we had full intentions of dipping out to Bennington and checking out the local watering holes, the motivation never materialized and before we knew it, afternoon had turned to evening. The girls had hitched into town with a local lady who took them to the brewery and they had drinks there before eventually finding their way to the motel. Pony and I mustered enough energy to cross the street again for snacks at the local ice cream shop which was hopping with locals. It had rained hard early this afternoon while we hid inside but it was now a pleasant evening and it looked like the whole town was out there. I finished my ice cream and headed back to the motel for a little more bad cable and a soft bed to sleep in.
