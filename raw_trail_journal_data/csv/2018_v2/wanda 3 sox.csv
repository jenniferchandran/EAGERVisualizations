In 2016 I started at Harper's Ferry and hiked north, planning to do a flip flop, but my ankle again stopped me outside of  Lickdale, PA.  Then later in the year my sister and I hiked 2/3 of Vermont.  A total of approximately 450 miles for the year.
In 2017 I started at the Nantahala Outdoor Center and hiked north for about 2 months then headed north to hike in Maine with my sister.  We finished about 150 miles there.  Then I did a few other miles in CT and MA.  Total for 2017 was about 650 miles.
I still have about 1/2 of the trail to finish so I'm starting in VA where I left off last June and will hike as far as my body will allow this year.",,View Entry,"Mar 10, Sat",0

I will probably have drop boxes for about half the time this year.  In past years I've done more boxes , but just got tired of putting them together this year and will be in sections where food will be easy to access, just off the trail in the Shenandoahs and in NJ and sections of NY. 
Still have lots of things to do to get ready, so I'd better get back to it.",,View Entry,"Apr 16, Mon",0

It was a relatively nice hike today.  The trail wasn't overly difficult except I'm sure out of shape which didn't surprise me.  It was hot, probably about 85 and there were no water sources.  I had planned for that but still almost ran out of water.  I'm camped just past the VA 611 parking lot, hoping there aren't any partyers that come up from town tonight.  I was so tired that I couldn't carry my pack another foot so I stopped and got my tent out of my pack and it started sprinkling so I set it up in light rain.  Then I grabbed my water filter and hiked .3 mile to a dried up creek but I had made a note from Whirled Peas' journal on my trail guide that if you walked up the creek there would be water and she was right.  Had trouble with my filter so it took forever to do.  Came back to camp and ate the other half of the sandwich I carried out from town.

Woke up at 5:45 due to the birds making so much noise.  Was able to doze off and finally got up at 7:00 and was on the trail by 8:45.  Had to hike up Brushy Mtn. again, I think we've done that at least 3 times now.  Water was going to be scarce again this afternoon so filtered extra water at the last stream I would go past today.  Still having issues with my filter so I plan to buy a new one in Pearisburg this week.  Carried 3 containers of water and boy was it heavy.  In addition there was a big climb this afternoon and temps were in the mid 80's.  I took more breaks this afternoon than I ever had.

Had a hamburger and potato wedges and a Diet Coke.  All of it tasted great!  I met a section hiker from here in VA and we enjoyed our food.  When I got up to leave, I realized I'd forgotten to charge my phone so I had to wait for that.  Got back on the trail around 1:00 and walked 1.5 mile then took a .3 side trail to Dismal Falls.  It was a great day to soak your feet.  The water was very cold but felt great.  By the time I got my feet taped up (I have 4 blisters) it was 4:00.  One of the thru hikers gave me some KT tape to hold the Band-Aids in place.  I've never had this much trouble with blisters before.
After the .3 mile walk back to the AT I hiked until almost 6:00 and found a stealth camping site.  I'm the only one here, but there's not room for one tent.  I'm next to a creek with very cold water...just what I needed after such warm temps.
Got set-up, ate a tuna sandwich and called Mom to wish her a Happy Mother's Day and washed off in the creek.  Have been drinking the cold creek water since I got here.  Guess I'll be up several times tonight.  This was a very different day on the trail...only hiked 5.5 AT miles but actually walked 7.1 miles.  The miles to Trent's and to the falls don't count.  Too bad!  It was worth the extra miles for both.","Stealth Camp mm 607

We found a shady spot and took a long break then I had to get water so she went on ahead.  I got extremely overheated and had to stop frequently.  I thought I'd made it to the top and considered spending the night at a campsite there but thunderstorms were predicted and that wasn't a good place to be with thunder and lightning.  Plan B was to hike down the mountain and stealth camp so I kept walking.  Surprise, surprise...that was a false summit.  I hiked at least another 1.5 hour to the top and then the descent had no shade.  I put a Nunn tablet in my water and kept going because there was no place to camp.
Then I got to Big Horse Gap...Forest Service had done a controlled burn.  Hiked thru burned out forest for a 1.5 miles.  The charred smell was horrible and, of course, no campsites available even if I'd wanted to stay.  Decided to stay at Woods Hole Hostel for the night.  It's located .5 off the trail and I could hardly stand up when I got here.  
This is a very nice hostel and Neville was very helpful.  I decided to have Neville shuttle me to Pearisburg and I might go to a clinic to get my blisters looked at.  I have one on each heel which doesn't concern me, but I also have one on a toe on each foot.  These are around a toenail and look like blood blisters and are pushing up the nail.","Stealth Camp @ mm 612.5

I really put the feet to the test today.  It was a relatively easy (well, not really easy) hike until the last 1.5 miles where it was switchbacks down to the road.  There was so much mud and the trail was a creek in some areas.  I had planned to camp on the ridge before I got there, but decided to camp somewhere right outside Pearisburg since I was going to the post office first thing in the morning.  Well I couldn't find anywhere to camp and had to hike all the way to the road and then .9 miles to town.  Total miles for the day was 12.3 by the time I got to the hostel.  What a day....I was afraid of what I would find when I took off my boots, but everything was fine.","Woods Hole Hostel

Today I mailed home my winter gear and some misc. gear.  I started to the post office and realized I'd left my money behind.  Everything works out for a reason..
I was able to get a box from someone who had just gotten a new pair of shoes and the hostel had tape, so I was able to get everything ready and not try to do all that at the PO.  I also met Kinder and Pinecone.  I had met Pinecone at Wood's Hole a couple days ago. Kinder is a section hiker who has only 200 miles to finish the entire trail.  Wow!  I think we all might do Dragon's Tooth together because we're all concerned about that section.  It's known as a difficult section with rock scrambles and ledges with just finger holds.  What a relief to have others to do it with.
Got my package mailed and went to lunch at Pappa's Pizza with Pinecone.  Meatball sub tasted great topped off with a cupcake.  Just relaxed the rest of the day.  One of the hikers made pasta bake for dinner...yum!","Pearisburg (Angel's Rest Hostel)

Pinecone is fast so she hiked on and Kinder and I came to a swift running creek and I fell in while crossing.  Took me a few minutes to get up but when I did I just said ""How refreshing"".  Bad thing was that I had to retape my feet and  then walk in wet boots and socks all day. Walked for a mile and R.R. came up behind us.  I knew he was going North so that meant we were headed in the direction.  I turned around and walked back across the creek.  Kinder decided to continue north and get a shuttle from a different road.  So now we're all split up.
Had a long, exhausting hike but it was fun because I was meeting all the hikers I'd met in the last week at the 2 hostels.  Made the trip a social one, even tho it slowed me down.  Four hikers told me there was a bear close to the powerlne clearing, but he was gone by the time I arrived.  Made it to Rice Field Shelter a little before 6 and tried to call to let them know I'd be at the pickup point in 90 minutes.  No cell signal but was able to get out a text and they were able to call me to confirm. So got picked up at 7:30.  What a long day!
Pinecone and Kinder were already back at the hostel. It had been an ordeal for them to get back, but we all made it.  I actually hiked 17.5 miles but only 15.5 counts as AT miles.","Stony Creek

Is close to where they are building the gas pipeline and they don't let any cars up that road but the trail is right where the road is blocked.  I headed into the woods and at the next gravel road crossing there as a pickup truck that drove by.  I think the driver was a pipeline worker just checking to make sure I was actually hiking and not up to some kind of mischief.  There are 2 tree sitters still protesting.  Someone  is getting food to them somehow and maybe they thought I was part of that group.  The truck driver past me and then turned around and came back by me.  I just waved and he didn't stop.  One of the protestors has been out there for 30 days and the other for 60 days.  I saw all kinds of police tape when I was hiking yesterday.
The trail went under the US 460 bridge and then you pass by a big factory that makes cigarette filters (I think) then you walk along the highway  for about .5 mile.  It was hot and noisy.  Then you pass the Pearisburg Cemetery and walk along a nice pathway.  Then the trail goes uphill and before I knew it I popped out of the woods at Cross Ave. And walked .9 to the hostel with a stop at DQ at 4:00.  Pleasant, short hike.  Still having blister problems but at least I can still hike some.","Clendennin Road

The hike down was fine and we got to VA 620 around 5:15 where Joe was waiting to take us back to the car at his hostel.  We had perfect weather all day (sunny and clear with a slight breeze).
We treated ourselves to dinner at The Homeplace.  Food was delicious...served family-style and lots of it.  If you're ever in this area be sure to stop here.  It was busy and they said a 40 min. wait but we only waited about 30 mins.  We had fried chicken, roast beef and BBQ pork with mashed potatoes and gravy, cole slaw, pinto beans, biscuits and apple butter, and cooked apples all for only $16.

The trail is very rocky in this section and kinda muddy.

I started hiking again and saw a deer.  She just stood there and looked at me so I watched her for several minutes.  I don't try to take a picture because usually the deer moves before I get it and I just wanted to enjoy watching her.  After a few minutes she started eating again and I moved on.  This afternoon the trail went through several pastures.  I only saw one small herd of cows and they were in an adjacent field.
It sprinkled off and on all day and the water from the trees added to the moisture.  My hair was soaked by lunchtime but it was too warm to wear my rain jacket, but I did put on my pack cover.
Found a campsite early...around 3:30 and decided to stop because I needed to try to dry out my tent.  The tent dried out but the fly didn't and it started sprinkling so I just put it on the tent fairly wet.  I didn't have a choice because all my stuff was already in the tent and I didn't want it to get wet.  Ate an early dinner  of mashed potatoes and bacon bits.  Didn't really taste all that great but I topped it off with a candy bar for dessert.  As I sit here typing, it's sprinkling again...is this rain ever going to stop!","War Spur Shelter

The first sight of the day was the Keffer Oak.  This tree is over 300 years old.  Beside that tree was an orange turtle.  He just sat there and didn't move.  Then the trail climbed to the top of Sinking Creek Mountain where it stayed for 2-3 miles.  This is the Eastern Continental Divide.  It was rocky with some rock scrambles but on most of it I was able to stay in the dirt next to the rocks and didn't have to navigate across them.  I had read about having to crab walk this part, but I didn't need to.  The rocks were wet and slick so I was relieved to finish that section.  Then there was a huge, steep descent which was slick also.  I'm proud to say I didn't fall once.  Water was scarce today but on the descent I found a good stream and was able to fill my bottle.  Once I got to the bottom of the descent, the sun came out.  Haven't seen it in days!

Started the uphill climb.  This started as a gradual ascent, thank goodness, because the heavy pack was really causing me grief.  Asked a couple of hikers if there was water at the first shelter and they both said yes.  So after I ate lunch I poured out about a third of my water.  The afternoon hike up was steeper than this morning, so I was glad to be carrying less weight.  Got to Fullhardt Shelter around 3:00 and set up my tent.  A few minutes later 3 hikers come into the shelter but said they didn't know if they were staying the night.  Did a few other set up chores then went over to get some water.  The guys said there was no water.  What...I was already set up, so I just figured I'd have to drink what water I had sparingly.  I was a little perturbed because 2 hikers had told me there was water here.  The 3 hikers left to go to someplace with water, several miles up the trail.
I was curious about how the spigot for the cistern worked so I tried it and water came out.  It wasn't very much but I got enough to supplement what I already had so I felt much better.  I'll bet those 3 hikers didn't wait long enough for it to start trickling.

Decided I couldn't eat one more protein bar so I made a PB&J sandwich.  Just as I was ready to take a bite a Jeep pulled up right beside me.  Couldn't figure out why he did that because the parking lot was empty.  I looked up and saw a Trail Magic sign on his windshield.  Hooray I was going to get Trail Magic!!!  His name was Luke and he gave me a banana, a cold bottle of water and topped off my hand sanitizer.  We talked while I ate my sandwich and then some more hikers showed up.  This was his last day doing trail magic this year since he had some travel plans coming up.  
As I was putting on my pack and getting ready to leave another car pulled up along side me.  It was another trail angel doing trail magic.  She asked me if I needed all kinds of things, and I told her I was all set...then she asked if I wanted cookies.  Those I couldn't refuse.  She handed me a sleeve of thin mint Girl Scout cookies.  I hit the jackpot.  Her name is Cherokee Rose.  Wow 2 trail magics in less than an hour!  Thank you both!!!
Now back to hiking...the trail crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway several times today.  Water is still scarce so I had to fill up at a shelter .2 mile off the trail.  Not fun doing .4 mile that doesn't count in total mileage.  It was hot...up to 86 today.  The last hour was the most difficult...had to climb Cove Mtn.  Instead of being in the green tunnel (walking under tree cover) the trail was out in the open with the sun beating down.  Soon after I got to the top there was a campsite so that was the end of my day.  Got my tent set up quickly because it looked like rain.  Made dinner and am now in my tent at 6:30.  Hasn't rained yet so hopefully it won't.

I accepted if I hadn't found another way there by the time we both got to VA614.  I got there at noon and he had said he wouldn't be there until 12:30 or 1:00.  So I sat on a rock in the shade in the parking lot to wait.  I waited until 2:30 then decided we must have missed each other.  So I started working on another plan.  Unfortunately I didn't have a cell signal so I was stuck.  Went to the road and stuck out my thumb and the second car that went by stopped and they were going very close to Glasgow and would take me there.  Thank you Chris, Heather and Jenny.

He says he does it because he enjoys it and refuses to take any donations for it.

I asked Rosie Red if we were really on the AT because it was flat and good trail...unlike any part of trail in NH that we've done yet.  It really was the AT and this good trail continued until we stopped at Ethan Pond Shelter for lunch.  It was so windy and cool that we had to put on our jackets and we were still freezing  We had planned on camping there but we would have had to sit around all afternoon and neither of us wanted to do that.  So we finished lunch and started hiking again.  The trail was a gradual descent and even though it had more rocks than the trail this morning, it still was better than previous NH trail.

Washington and then stealth camp on the way down or stay at the shelter more than 1/2 way down the mountain or hike all the way down to the road and go into town.  We explained our concern about any of those options because we are slow hikers and probably couldn' t make it that far.  He insisted that even though the trail is more difficult going down, we would be able to make it.  We finally decided to try it.  We had a bowl of vegetarian soup and took off.
Mt. Washington is 6288 ft. and the second highest peak on the trail (behind Clingman's Dome).  The climb up wasn't too hard...in fact we wondered what the big deal is about climbing it.  The weather was fantastic...we could see for miles in all directions.  We had heard before we went up that you could see for 100 miles today.   We got a hot dog and pizza, chips and Diet Cokes at the snack bar.  While we were eating up walks Justus who we met at the Welcome Hiker Hostel and he had given us a ride to get ice cream.  We talked with him about the Wildcat Mtns. which he had just finished and we would do soon.  It was good to see him again.  He had a shuttle arranged down the mountain to his car.
We started down at 4:30 and got a huge surprise...the trail was just a jumble of rocks and it didn't get any better the further we went.  We were above treeline so we couldn't camp until we got below treeline.  The rocks got a little better but it was still difficult going.  We walked and walked until the sun set and the wind picked up.  The guy at the hut had told us we could take the Sphinx Trail off the AT to get down to treeline where we could stealth camp.  We never saw that trail take off the AT.  Now it was getting dark and we had no place to camp and rain is predicted for tonight.  We turned on our headlamps and the AT is headed up another mountain so we saw a sign for Israel Ridge Trail that is supposed to connect to the Perch Trail where the shelter is and kept going.  At the next trail junction there are no signs for the Israel Ridge Trail.  We did see a sign for the shelter so we go that way.  The trail doesn't have blazes to follow but rock cairns.  These get smaller and further apart as we go further.
It's now about 10:00 and we're in the middle of nowhere in the dark with the winds blowing harder.  The sunset had been reddish tonight so I thought it wouldn't rain because I'd always heard ""red sky at night ...sailor's delight"" but we weren't ready to test it out, so we kept walking.  We were both incredibly nervous as it got later and later and our bodies were beyond exhausted.  I fell over on my side a few times and Rosie Red had taken a tumble when her hiking pole collapsed as we got toward the bottom of a rock scramble so she wasn't much stronger.  After that fall she had quickly told me she was ok..   Finally at 11:10pm we walked into the shelter and campsite.  It was empty but we were so thankful to be there.  God had certainly watched over us tonight.  We pitched our tent inside the shelter since no one else was there.  It took quite a while for the adrenalin to calm down so we could get some sleep.  We had hiked for over 13 hours and more than 11.5 miles over tough terrain descending Mt.

Same forecast that we see every day.
We had to climb Mt. Moriah first thing this morning and had a snack of fresh blueberries from the bushes at the side of the trail..  They were delicious but there weren't many left..  Animals and other hikers had gotten to them first.  The smoke from the wildfires was stuck under the clouds and it was sitting on some of the mountain tops.  We got whiffs of the smoke as we hiked.  At one point we turned around at an overlook and saw it moving over the area where we had just walked.  It was very eerie.
After summitting Mt. Moriah the trail got a bit easier.  We still descended for 4.5 hours.  I slid on a loose rock and fell and sat in the mud, but my situpon attached to the bottom of my pack  buffered my fall as usual.  We stopped to filter water from Rattle River before we got to the shelter.  We had to cross the river 3 times but thankfully only one time caused us any concern.  We were able to rock hop across the first 2 times and the last time we just followed 2 other hikers across.
Got to the shelter at 4:00 and pitched our tent and got set up.  We had cold ramen noodles for dinner and talked to Latch (another section hiker) and his dad who are doing a 75 mile section southbound to Franconia Notch.  We met Poe and Savage who were finishing their 21 mile slackpack.  They are staying at the Rattle River Hostel and offered to make us a reservation since we don't have a cell signal.  Very nice of them!  It started raining when we got back to our tent.  So, we're in for the night...listening to the rain.","Imp Shelter

We got to the road and made some phone calls and reserved a room at Royalty Inn for 2 nights.  We were on the edge of town so we started hitching and within 10 minutes we had a ride with Miranda.  She told us this was the first time she had picked up hitchhikers.  She figured we looked safe.  Thanks Miranda!
Our room wasn't clean yet so we left our packs in the lobby and went to McDonald's.  We had a second breakfast of sausage burritos and a cold Diet Coke.  We sat and took care of the calls we needed to make and figured out our tentative schedule for the next section.  By that time it was lunch time so we got McChicken sandwiches.   While we were in McDonald's it poured and it was nice to watch the rain and stay dry.  After lunch we went back to the motel and our room was ready 15 minutes later.
The showers felt wonderful and we had lots of gear to dry out.  Most of it wasn't wet just very damp.  We did laundry at the motel and took care of some town chores then went to dinner at the new BBQ restaurant in town.  Came back to the room and collapsed.

The bus had mechanical problems and it would only run for 2 minutes at a time.  So the bus driver had to turn on the bus and it would run for 2 minutes and then completely shut off.  She had warning lights on the dash that told her when the bus would shut off and she was able to get to the side of the road and wait a few seconds and start it up and drive for another 2 minutes.  It was a long ride to Waynesboro but we got there only an hour late.  There was silence on the bus while all this was happening.  I guess we all just wanted it to keep running.
When I got to Waynesboro, Red, a shuttle driver from Stanimal's hostel, was waiting for me.  I'd been texting him and keeping him updated with what was happening.  On our way to the hostel, the car started running really rough  and I wasn't sure we were going to make it but we did.  I had reserved a private room at the hostel because I knew I wouldn't have slept much on the train the night before and wanted to be able to take a nap if I could.  The room had 2 twin beds and a loveseat and dresser.  It was spotless as was the bathroom.  I highly recommend this place.  It is close to several fast food restaurants and has several options for resupply.  I went to Arby's and to a Walmart Neighborhood Market.  Didn't feel like a nap but was in bed before 9:00.
The Stanimal's shuttle took me to the trail at 8:00am and I was hiking by 8:15.  One mile from Rockfish Gap is the southern border of Shenandoah Natl. Park.  There is a kiosk where you register and get a Backcountry permit.  It's free but you must have it.  About five minutes after the kiosk I heard rustling in a bush next to the trail..it was too loud for a squirrel, chipmunk or bird so when I was about 10 ft. from it I cleared my throat a couple of times loudly and a bear ran out of the bush and down the hill away from me.  I stood and watched then he turned around and looked at me.  He was about 20 yards down the hill and I decided it was time for me to move on.  He didn't move or make any attempt to follow me.  It was a neat bear sighting.
Today's hike was hot but much easier than what we did in NH and ME.  The trail crosses Skyline Drive all the way through the Park.  Today I crossed it twice.  I crossed Bears Den Mountain, Little Calf Mountain and Calf Mountain.  Before I crossed Skyline Drive at Beagle Gap I crossed a gravel road that they probably use to get to Bears Den Mountain (there are communication towers at the top).  I stopped  and looked to my left and there was a bear just moseying on the road eating from the bushes.  He walked a few feet toward me but was too busy eating to care that I was watching him.  He was probably 50 yards from me and then he just walked back into the woods.  Wow, 2 bears in a couple of hours!
Had to carry more water today because there were no water sources until .1 mile from the shelter. I got there at 1:00, filled up and walked on to the shelter.  I was staying here tonight because the next shelter is 13 miles further.  I had just started looking at the tent sites when another hiker walked in.  We both chose our site and I ate lunch.  The hiker who came in was part of a 3-sister section hiking team (Mae and Laura and I can't remember the oldest sister's name).  They started at the northern border of SNP and will finish tomorrow.  Their mother has provided support every couple of days when they cross the road.  Today is Laura's birthday and they had a little section of streamers and balloons that they hung up at the shelter.  Another couple (Jim and Lisa) also arrived...they are doing the southern 50 miles of the SNP.  It was a fun group and kept me from missing Rosie Red so much.  She would have loved this section of trail.","Rockfish Gap

Wildlife is abundant in the Park.  Today I woke two deer from their naps several miles apart.  The second one was a buck with antlers.  All I saw at first were the antlers and I thought it might be a moose.  I forgot I was in VA now and not in ME.  And the fact that moose and deer antlers don't look anything alike.  I also heard heavy breathing from a bush.  I'm sure it was a bear but I never saw it and didn't want to hang around to see if it would come out.  I was much too close for comfort.
This day seemed to go on forever.  The last couple of miles were uphill and the last half mile was steep.  Then the hut (shelter) was .2 off the trail going down steeply.  When I got to the hut two section hikers (Guitarzan and Oreo) were relaxing because they'd been there since early afternoon.  They encouraged me to stay in the shelter because there was a possibility of rain and we heard thunder.  There weren't any good campsites so I finally got set up in the shelter.  We were just sitting around talking at 8:15 and I decided to go around the side of the shelter to change clothes.  I heard rustling in the leaves but couldn't see anything then 10 seconds later a snake slithered out and I yelled ""we've got a snake"".  I wasn't alarmed and both Guitarzan and Oreo came over.  They were alarmed because it was a copperhead.  Both grabbed a hiking pole and herded it over to the ravine where the creek was and flipped it down into it.
We went back to chatting and a few minutes later I saw another copperhead come out of a crack in the foundation on the left of the shelter.  They again herded it over the side of the ravine.  A few minutes later out comes another one.  Guitarzan said he wasn't going to sleep in the shelter and was going to pitch his tent.  So we all three give the campsites a look and came to the conclusion that they were all awful (rocky, rooty and unlevel).  We walked back to the shelter and see another snake and Guitarzan said ""I'm going to a hostel and we all agree.  So 20 minutes later we're all walking up the hill with our headlamps on and taking the AT back to the road.  We covered that .7 mile in 15 minutes.  We were booking!

All of this hiking to get water took an hour and the sun was already hot, but I finally got headed northbound.  I still had to deal with the area with the bears that caused Guitarzan so much trouble.  I think these bears also caused the 3 sisters trouble a couple of days ago.  I was worried.  I was super vigilant and moved quickly.  Luckily I didn't encounter them.  Whew!
One of the neat things I saw today was Blackrock.  This is just a huge jumble of rocks of all sizes.  The best thing about them is I didn't have to climb over, under or through them.  There was a nice flat gravel path to walk through them.  ME could take a lesson from VA.

I had walked to the Wayside from the campstore area which was 1.1 mile mostly downhill.  I knew I needed to find a ride back to my campsite because it was even a further distance and all uphill.  I was concerned because the campground isn't on the way to anywhere.  The road deadends there.  When I had finished my sandwich, I went to the gift store checkout counter and asked the clerk if she knew if anyone headed toward the campground on their way home from work.  She smiled and said yes and what did I need.  She graciously offered me a ride.  Wow...just what I needed.  Thank you Susan.

Got packed up and went to the campstore for resupply, charged my phone and ate breakfast.  It was 10:45 when I started hiking.  The next hut is only 5.9 miles so this was a short day.  I was so enjoying this day.  Got to the hut around 3:30 after taking several breaks.  Got my tent set up and it started raining.  Threw all my gear in the tent and went to the shelter to wait it out.  It was just a brief shower so I organized everything in my tent but then it started raining and has rained for hours now.  There is a group from Washington University here on a freshman orientation trip.  They've been out for 5 days and only have 2 miles to do in the morning.  Nice bunch and so much energy.

Met a few more hikers than the last few days.  Of course, all of them are SOBOs since the NOBOs are long gone from this area.  Talked to Burpee from Bristol, TN.  She's hiking with 2 guys from Alaska.  I also met a trail maintainer and told him there were 2 large trees down across the trail.  He said all he's done since March is remove trees that have fallen across the trail.  He comes up twice a week to check.  Just doing that keeps him busy.
Got to the hut at 2:30 even though I stopped for an hour for lunch.  The next hut is over 12 miles so I stopped for the day.  Did all my normal chores and had to dry out my tent so it's a good thing I stopped early while the sun was still shining.  Had cold Ramen again for dinner.  After I had eaten a father and son walked in.  I was so glad to have some company.  They only came in for a bite to eat and then were going to hike on and stealth camp.  I'm sure they thought ""doesn't she ever shut up?"".

At 5:30 I started packing up (I thought it would be getting light by 5:30 but I was wrong).  I used my headlamp to take down the tent and by 6:30 the sky was dawning.  Finished all my chores and was on the trail by 7:15.  Went to the top of Hightop Mtn. and saw the father/son duo who had stopped at the shelter for dinner.  Looked like they were trying to get packed up and I knew I'd see them later when they passed me on the trail so I didn't say anything.  Hiked on a few more minutes and they caught up with me.  After a brief conversation they took off like lightning.
When I got to the next Skyline Drive crossing they were there.  I told them they must have been standing there a long time for me to catch up with them.  Turns out they had gone to get their Backcountry registration.  So they took off again.
I took a wrong turn just before the South River Picnic Area and ended up off trail and had to walk on Skyline Drive for a quarter of a mile.  This section of the road has no shoulder so when a car came I had to get off the road and walk in the ankle-high wet grass.  Thank goodness I only had to do that 4-5 times.  I came to the entrance to the picnic area from Skyline but didn't know where to catch the trail again.  One of the picnicers helped me out and I only had to walk the length of the area to get back on the trail...but who should I meet but the father/son duo again.  This may seem unimportant but I never catch up with hikers who are so much faster than I am.  However, this is the last time I would see them today.
Climbed Baldface Mtn. and finally Lewis Mtn. and got to the campground around 3:00.  It had looked like rain for an hour and started thundering.  I wasn't thrilled with the 3 campsites that were still open so I went to the campstore for a sandwich and a cold drink to consider my options.  A few minutes later fog rolled in like I've never seen before.  It was fast moving and heavy.  In a few minutes it started to pour.  It rained for more than 45 minutes and big puddles were everywhere.  I decided that I wanted to go to a dry hostel or motel.  I called all of them in Luray, the closest town (which isn't even that close) and all were booked solid due to Labor Day weekend.  One of the campers, Keith, who had been standing on the porch when I made all the calls, offered to let me pitch my tent on his campsite.  I agreed and thanked him.   While I was still sitting there waiting for my phone to charge, a guy who's wife I had talked to earlier came over and invited another hiker (Walter from Switzerland) and I to have dinner with his family.  He mentioned mac 'n cheese and I immediately accepted.  It was a great dinner with Greg and his wife and his parents.  How nice of them to invite us.
The fog started rolling in again so I left to put up my tent.  It's a great campsite...my tent is pitched in lush grass not the gravelly dirt that most campgrounds have.  Rain was threatening again but it missed us this time.

Started hiking at 9:30 and it was a surprisingly easy day. Only had a couple of ascents and they were both short.  This was the day to see deer.  First I saw a doe right after I got on the trail.  Then a little later I saw 2 fawns, then a doe and 2 fawns.  There were quite a few day hikers and several SOBOs.  Went through Milam Gap where the Milam apple was created.  I've never heard of this variety but will start looking for it.  The settlers in the Shenandoah area sold apples for a cash crop and so they created the Milam.
I stopped for a snack and also stopped for cheese and crackers.  Don't usually take that many breaks but it was such a nice day.  I arrived at the campstore in Big Meadows at 2:30 and it was pandemonium.  There were people everywhere and long lines at the grocery, restaurant and carryout counters.  I got a diet Coke and got out of there.  Had planned to eat but too many people.  Everyone was taking advantage of the nice weather for at least part if the Labor Day weekend.
I walked up the hill to get a campsite (.9 mile).  I was thankful that there were still a few available.  Dried out my tent from last night and got set up.  Looked at my hiking schedule and figured out what I needed to buy.   A few hours later I decided to try the store and wayside again.  It was much better this time and I got a few items for resupply and some chicken fingers and fries.  Then I walked back up to the campground and took a shower and did laundry.  Ready for bed and a good night's sleep.","Lewis Mtn Campground

There were again several day hikers and a couple of SOBOs on the trail.  I made it to Rock Spring Hut by noon and decided to continue hiking since it was so early.  Then I stopped for a snack and a little later stopped just to take a break.  The trail has rocks in it today that  make your feet and knees ache.  I made a phone call and it started sprinkling.  While I was talking it started raining so I cut the call short.  It was the same as a couple of days ago when a fog rolled in and brought rain with it.  Thankfully this time the rain wasn't nearly as heavy.  I  put on my pack cover and my rain jacket.  The rain jacket came off immediately because it was too hot.  So I walked in the rain for a few minutes then it let up and stopped.
By this time I was getting close to the Skyland Resort.  I definitely didn't plan to stay here, but I decided to stop and take a break.  Then I decided to ask if they had any rooms available and ended up handing the woman at the desk my credit card and staying the night.  I was hot and tired and felt the money would be well spent.  Got everything dried out and relaxed the rest of the evening.","Big Meadows Campground

The trail wasn't bad this morning but there are still rocks embedded in the dirt causing you to pay attention so you don't turn an ankle or trip.  Enjoyed lunch at Pinnacles Picnic Area and filled up on water because the water source attached the shelter is .4 from the shelter on a service road.  That would be almost a mile round trip.
Have only seen a couple of other hikers today.  As I was hiking along I saw a female hiker standing in the middle of the trail facing me about 30 yards ahead.  I saw a set of hiking poles at the side of the trail and thought maybe her hiking partner was taking a bathroom break so I slowed down and waited to get a signal from her.  Turns out she was just waiting for her brother to make a phone call.  As we talked I found out they were into their second day of a section hike and things weren't going well.  It was really hot and they were struggling with heavy packs.  They had lots of questions and I encouraged them to lighten the load and not to give up.   They had called for a pickup at the picnic area and were going home to regroup.  I remember those first weeks four years ago when I started in GA.  It was incredibly hard.  And section hikers go through that same conditioning phase every time they start again.  I gave them my contact info in case they had questions and I think they'll tweak their gear and try again and will probably be successful.  It's trial and error at the beginning.
I arrived at the Hut around 3:30 and got set up.  As I was walking back to the shelter after pitching my tent I met a couple who were SOBOs.  The husband looked at me and said  ""I think we've met before.""  He asked if I had been in the Whites, and I realized we'd crossed paths a few weeks ago in NH.  They are flip-flopping from Harper's Ferry and are heading south toward GA.  Crazy how you run into hikers over a thousand miles later!

headed back to Virginia yesterday and stayed at the Teahorse Hostel
last night. Drove my car this time and parked it at the Harper's
Ferry National Park this morning. Tom, a hiker that I met on the
trail the day before I left gave me a ride from Harper's Ferry to
Thornton Gap. On the way we stopped at Mountain Cabbin Hostel to
drop off a supply box (I'll stay there Saturday night). We got to
the trail and it had already started raining and was supposed to
continue all day and night. I considered just taking a zero but I
needed to do some miles because I'm on a tight schedule to finish
this section by next Thursday and meet Rosie Red (my sister, Yvonne)
in New York next Friday. So I put on my pack and started hiking. Just as I was about to walk over to the trail, Tom's pastor pulled in
behind us. He thought Tom was having car trouble so he stopped to
help. Since there wasn't an issue with the car and Tom explained
what I was doing, Jim prayed for me and my safety. That was very
nice.
I
finally started hiking at 11:45 and the rain was steady but not too
heavy. The trail was very wet to the point of being a muddy, sloppy
mess in places. I can't believe I'm saying this but the rocks and
gravel in the trail keep it from being slick. If the trail was going
up or down (those pointless ups and downs, PUDS) it was easier to
hike. The flat sections just collected water and became one big
puddle or the dirt turned to slick mud. About 3pm the rain picked up
and the trail as well as everything else got wetter. I started
getting concerned...I had planned to stealth camp because the closest
shelter was 6 miles further and I was too tired to even attempt that
many miles. However, I knew finding a stealth site was going to be
very difficult and I was wet and starting to get chilled so I went
into the Elkwallow Wayside to decide what to do. I didn't have a
cell signal and couldn't even get a text to go out so the cashier,
Carol, suggested I call Alison at Open Arms Hostel and ask her to
pick me up. I had to use their landline and thankfully Alison had
room and would come and get me. I'm so thankful to everyone who
helped me today...that was a lot of Trail Angels in one day.","Thornton Gap

was a glorious day. It rained very hard around 2am for at least an
hour before I fell back to sleep. So glad I was at the hostel. This
morning was sunny but chilly. As Alison was driving me back to
Elkwallow Wayside we saw a bear by the side of the road. It was just
eating and looking at us. This was the closest I've been to a bear
yet, 10 yards. We did have the car for protection, but we didn't
need it. He was uninterested in us.
Started
hiking at 8:45 and made it 6 miles by 12:45. I ate lunch at Gravel
Springs Hut. I really didn't want to go there because it is .2 off
trail with a steep downhill which means .2 uphill to get back on the
trail, but I needed water and that was the only source until much
later in the day. It was peaceful there and I filled up on water for
the rest of the day and for tonight and the beginning of the day
tomorrow. The next water source is 6 miles ahead and I wasn't sure
if I would make it that far today.
There
were so many hikers on the trail. They were all headed south. Several thru hikers had been at hostels for a couple of days waiting
for the rain to stop. There were also several section hikers who
were out for the first time ever. They were full of questions. It
is neat to see their enthusiasm.
The
terrain was varied today. Lots of water and mud in the flat
sections. The views from the mountains were clear after the
undercast cleared. That is a term I'd never heard before.  It's when
the clouds are below the ridges of the mountains in the valleys and
you look down on them.
I
stopped at a stealth site after the top of Compton Peak. It was big
enough for 3-4 tents. I got set up and was eating dinner when two
section hikers walked in and I asked if they were going to join me. They said yes...if it was ok with me. Truth be told I was glad they
stopped. It will be nice to have company tonight (Sodium and Rest
Stop). My last night in the Shenandoahs is a pleasant one. Tomorrow
I will cross the northern border of the Park and stop at Front Royal
for the night. The best news is that the forecast says no rain until
next Tuesday. I hiked a whopping 12.8 miles today. Haven't done

up and made it out of camp before Sodium and Rest Stop. They were in
no hurry to leave. I found out as I hiked the first 10 minutes this
morning that I didn't cross the peak yesterday. It was actually .1
miles further, so that was the first thing this morning. There was a
nice view of the valley below and I could see it from several
overlooks.
Saw
something unusual today... I saw a deer in the trees and as it was
running away I saw two little white tails, so there were two deer. Then a few seconds later there was another deer on the other side of
the trail. It crossed in front of me and joined the other two who
had stopped. It was twins and their mother. They had probably been
born earlier in the year but they were still young. The mother
stopped and the twins started nursing. Everything was fine for a
couple of minutes and then mom decided that was enough and almost
stepped on one of the twin's back as she walked away. I guess mom
was trying to wean them, but I really did think she was going to step
on one of their backs. I guess the animal world is harsh sometimes.
Crossed
out of the park late this morning. It felt so good to have that
finished. The trail turned rocky before leaving the park and
continued the rest of the morning. I stopped at Tom Floyd Shelter
for an early lunch. Met Toots there packing up his gear for a late
start. He was killing time until some of his hiking buddies could
catch up. I asked if one of the hikers he was waiting for was
Stitches and he was surprised and asked how I knew Stitches since he
and his group were SOBO and I was heading north. Told him I had met
Stitches in Harper's Ferry at the Teahorse Hostel. Crazy how that
happens. Toots also mentioned that a super guy named Tom had picked
him up and taken him into Front Royal yesterday. When he said Tom I
just knew it had to be Tom who gave me a ride from Harper's Ferry to
Thornton Gap a couple of days ago. Tom is a trail angel extrodinare. Toots said Tom mentioned dropping of an older lady at Thornton Gap,
which is me. Amazing how many people you meet on the trail are
connected to others you meet on the trail later.
Toots
took off and I finished lunch and got back on the trail. Took a
wrong turn and ended up kinda lost for a few minutes. Instead of
white blazes I was seeing blue blazes which means a side trail. Retraced my steps and got back on trail 10 minutes or so later. Hiked on to US 522 where the hostel is located.
Crossed
the highway and turned east on the trail and ran into boards laid end
to end to keep hikers from having to walk in grass covering puddles. I was glad they were there until the boards ran out and I had to walk
several steps in the muddy water before there was another board. This happened 3-4 times. With all the water and mud on the trail, I
had managed to keep my boots dry all day and now they were wet and
covered in mud just before reaching the hostel. Oh well, I tried.
Reached
the hostel around 3:45 and got checked in and showered and loaded my
supplies into my pack. Before I had checked in Alison from Open Arms
in Luray texted me that I had left my pack cover at her hostel and
she had taken it to Front Royal so it would be there when I arrived. What a sweetheart! I hadn't even realized I'd left it.

from the Cabbin to a guest room in the main house. It was great to
see all the changes in the house since I was there 2 years ago. The
main house was built in 1849 and was uninhabitable when Scott and
Lisa bought it. They have redone the whole house and turned it into
a B&B. How cool it was to actually stay in a room they use for
hikers when the Cabbin is booked. They cooked us breakfast...I had
French Toast and Scott had baked a peach and blueberry pie so I had a
slice of that and grapes and strawberries. It was a feast and tasted
so good.

was going wonderfully until the last mile or so before the shelter. We went through a low lying area that had many creeks or maybe it was
just many branches of the same creek, but anyhow I had to do a lot if
rock hopping and figuring out how to cross the fast moving water. It
wasn't dangerous, just very slippery and the goal was to cross and
keep your boots and hiking poles dry. I succeeded but there were a
few almost mishaps. Got to the shelter at 4:30 and did my camp

trail goes across the Potomac River on a .5 mile bridge. It was noon
by the time I got there and very hot but it was a neat view of the
river. As I was headed up the trail after the bridge I saw a fox
coming toward me. As soon as it saw me it took off running in the
other direction. That is the first fox I've seen this year.
The
Appalachian Trail Conservancy office is in Harper's Ferry and that's
where I ended this section. Hooray another state (West Virginia)
done!!! I can't cross off Virginia yet because I still have a
section south of Waynesboro to do. I took the shuttle bus to the
National Park to get my car and went back to the ATC office to get my
picture taken for the scrapbook they keep of all the hikers. There
were several hikers who wanted to ask me questions now that I've
completed about 1700 miles. It was fun, but I didn't leave there
until 4:00 and I needed to get on the road toward New York. Rosie
Red is meeting me there to hike for 3 days. I can't wait. We both
will have a car so we hope to slack pack those days. It was up to 91
today and as I was driving a front must have come through and it
rained hard for about 1/2 hour and dropped 15 degrees. Stopped for
the night in Lickdale, PA at the Days Inn.","David Lesser Shelter

up and had breakfast at the hotel and did laundry. Checked out
before 11:00 and went on a wild goose chase to find where I got off
the trail near here a couple of years ago. It took me an hour to
find it but I finally did. I'll have to hike from there north to the
PA border xt year.
Drove
to NY and checked into the Tuxedo Motel in Southfields. Rosie Red
arrived from Rhode Island about 7:00 and we ordered pasta, salad and
bread for delivery from a pizza place. We had it delivered and it
filled a jumbo pizza box that I almost dropped when I took it from
the delivery man. Rosie Red moved quickly and saved it from going on
the floor. We ate about 1/3 of our entrees and saved the rest for
tomorrow.
We
both were exhausted from driving and ready to sleep.","Lickdale, PA

up at 6:00 after a good night's sleep. Took a shower and got ready
to slackpack today. Left the hotel around 8... don't know what took
us so long??? Then it took us an hour to get one car positioned at
one parking lot and another at the other lot. When we finally
started hiking we missed a blaze and walked 20 minutes the wrong way
and had to turn around and walk back.
Today's
hike went to several of the tourist places in Bear Mountain State
Park. It drizzled all day but we didn't get soaked or even put in
our rain gear. We walked across the Hudson River on the Bear Mtn.
Bridge. That was cool...it was .5 mile across. Then the trail goes
through the Trailside Museum and the Bear Mtn. Zoo. When we walked
up to the bears they were feeding them. There were 2 bears in the
exhibit area and we were feeling sorry for them not being able to
roam free. Then we read that most if the animals in this zoo are
there because they were injured in the wild somehow or had some
health issue or were unable to take care of themselves in the wild. That made us feel better. Then we sat at a picnic table under a roof
and ate lunch.
This
afternoon we hiked up Bear Mountain...a 1200ft. ascent...a lot of it
going up stairs. When we got to the top you can see the New York
skyline but, of course, since it was raining and foggy we couldn't
see anything. We didn't waste any time at the top and walked down. The descent was less steps and more trail (thank goodness).
We
got to the road where the car was parked and there was a woman hiker
at the side of the road trying to decide which way to walk on the
road to call her husband to pick her up, so we offered her a ride. The roads in the area are confusing and so we got turned around a
couple of times and it took us 45 minutes to get her to where her
husband was when it should have taken 10 minutes at the most. Oh
well, at least she got a ride.
We
had finished hiking at 3:00 and dropped the hiker off at 4:00. We
still had to go pick up my car which we had parked at the lot where
we started our hike this morning and then find a place to park for
the night. We were both hungry so after we moved the cars around we
ate an early dinner...leftover pasta and bread. Tasted even better
the second night. We're sleeping in Rosie Red's SUV tonight so it
will be cranped but we're tired so it will be fine.","Manitou Rd. parking lot

up at 6:00 and moved cars around and we were hiking by 8:00. It was
cloudy and foggy until around 2:00 so we didn't get to see any NYC
views still. Rosie Red took a tumble and landed on her side. She
is fine except for a small scrape on her arm. It's time for her to
get new boots! We were done hiking at 3:15. Then we stopped for gas
and I had an ice cream sandwich. Then we scoped out the parking lots
we'll use tomorrow.
As
you can tell it was an uneventful day. Oh, one bad thing...when we
got back to the parking lot we noticed a small pickup in the ditch
along the side of the driveway into the lot. Appears someone had hit
it and it went into the ditch. The owner was able to gun it and get
it out of the ditch. Later he drove it away but it didn't sound
good. Hope not too much damage was done.","Seven Lakes Dr. parking lot

we woke up this morning everything was wet outside. We had spent the
night the past 2 nights in Rosie Red's SUV. At least we stayed dry. We got up and got everything ready to hike and drove to Tiorati
Circle where we finished yesterday. It was raining now and we
decided not to hike today. Rosie Red is going home tomorrow and on
her way back we'll park my car at Manitou Rd. and she will drop me at
Pawling, NY where I hiked a section northbound last year. Then I'll
hike south to where my car is parked. I'm sure you're confused...it
confuses me too. I'm just filling in a section I didn't hike last
year.
We
drove to Newburgh. NY later this morning because the hotels in the
Bear Mountain area are expensive. We are staying at the Super 8
because they have laundry facilities. Got that chore done and I got things ready to go back to the trail. Not looking forward to
carrying a full pack again.","Arden Valley Rd. parking lot (Elk Pen)

wanda 3 sox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604823,I woke up early and looked at the forecast for the next week.  It is supposed to rain all day Thursday and every other day for the next week.  And the temps will drop also.  That's it...I'm going home and will be back next year...unless in the next few weeks there's a string of days with good temps and no rain (which probably won't happen).Rosie Red is going home to Rhode Island today.  She'll hike the 100 Mile Wilderness and Mt. Katahdin with me next summer.   So we spent our last day by shopping and having lunch.  It's back to the real world for both of us.  It's home to Indiana for me.I'm sad because I wanted to finish New York so I'd have less miles to do next year.  The stats are 526 miles this year for a total of 1726 and 464 to do next year.  It's been an eventful year and I'm thankful for all the hikers I've met and the Trail Angels who provided much appreciated help!  I also thank my family and friends who provided lots of support and encouragement!,,Indiana,"Oct 09, Tue",0
