Nighthawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555230,"I have been researching information for my adventure and put together my initial pack for training (train as you fight). I will adjust weight down as I get a better idea about my needs vs wants. I have learned over the years that I'm willing to compromise extra weight for added comfort. I'm using a Mountainsmith Apex 80 pack which provides more than enough capacity. After 27 years military training in full gear and body armor, my initial trial load seems easy. I will know more after I increase my training mileage.I know that I will ship stuff home at some point as the reality of actual needs becomes evident. I'm awaiting the Data book and companion so that I can further plan start date details and resupply locations. My goal is 120-125 days to complete.",,View Entry,"Feb 26, Sun",0
Nighthawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555272,I received the 2 books that I ordered today from the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. I am not impressed as most of the info in the books I already have resourced from other sites. The Thru-Hike Planner is the best of the two although I may still carry the data book on the trail for a quick reference if needed. I already had built a spreadsheet for itinerary with pivot tables (yes I'm a computer nerd) that has data input fields for mileage calculations and tracking as well as a checklist/expense tracker. If this all works well I will share for all to use if interested.,"

Nighthawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555326,"I've been compiling my gear tracker spreadsheet and am about 27 lbs pack weight without food and water. My training pack weight is 45 lbs and that seems pretty easy but I haven't been challenged with elevation climbs yet. Will be doing the Grand Canyon in October 2017 for a test run using my training weight and then a week in Gatlinburg in mid October 2017 for some day hiking equipment testing. I'm confident that I will be capable of high mileage but may be limited on distance by available resources such as next available campsite and such. That's my current planning challenge. The distances that I want to do don't quite work out for what's available. It would be great if you could just camp anywhere. One advantage is that I can take more rest days with higher mileage without compromising my completion date planned. And of course, unpredictable weather situations can slow me down. It's actually torturous to go through all of this planning and reading others journals when I'd rather be on the trail right now!","
