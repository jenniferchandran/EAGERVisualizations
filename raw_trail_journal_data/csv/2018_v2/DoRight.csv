DoRight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560449,"My plan for next year is to do a flip-flop. I will start in Harper's Ferry about 15 April and hike north to Mount Katahdin, Maine. Then return to Harper's Ferry by some means, and hike south to Springer Mountain, Georgia. I will try to keep this journal up to date, and I plan to have a SPOT transceiver with a web page showing my live progress. I will be 64 years old next year, and my guess is that it will take me about 6 1/2 months, finishing late October or early November.",,View Entry,"Apr 18, Tue",0
