Just got the new 2017 AT Guide as I have in the past and find it to be the go to planning source. Planning May 1, 2017 to start from Vernon NJ ending at Rutland VT by May 31. I them plan on 9/1/17 to go from Springer Mt, GA north to Rockfish Gap, VA to complete a 2nd major section in 2016. 
I'm 67 now and so if my knees hold out for 2017 I should complete the my AT journey by completing my final section from Rutland, VT to Mt Katahdin during May, 2018.",,"Rutland, VT","Jan 29, Sun",0
Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554915,"Continuing my warm up to my first big section hike for 2017. Did a moderately difficult 8 miles.  As I had mentioned previously, I had to abort last year's thru hike due to knee problems which forced me off the trail after 358 miles from PA to VA. I recently had new xrays which confirm I have moderate arthritis in my left knee, medial side. Little cartilage remains beneath one part of the bone under my left knee cap. Consequently starting toward the end of next month I will receive Euflexxa injections in the knee; one each week for 3 weeks. The pain is not too severe but the effect from the shots should be interesting. Due to the knee issues, I plan this year's 2 big sections (Vernon NJ to Rutland VT, then Springer Mt. to Rock fish Gap, VA) averaging about 8 to 12 miles per day on doctor's orders so to minimize bone loss over the long hall. I normally was doing 13 to 15 mi per day. I've completed my Vernon to Rutland itinerary with this less aggressive pace in mind. But even with the adjustment it will be very challenging and one that I am looking forward to.   Weather permitting I plan to start out sometime during the last week of April this year and end around the end of May. Then about September through November 15 of this year for the 2nd section. Final segment is next spring ....Rutland to Katahdin.",,Nescopeck State Park,"Feb 20, Mon",8
Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556396,"This may help some of you......I came up with an helpful planning tool for a section hike of generally a month or more. I call it the Elevation Severity Factor (""ESF""). This has been a big help for me in planning my section hike this spring from NJ to Rutland Vt.; a distance of about 344 miles.As I had mentioned previously, I have an arthritic left knee which is close to a bone on bone scenario (very little cartilage remaining). I will undergo 3 weekly Euflexxa injections to provide some degree of knee protection and pain relief. Compression wraps help some but are generally not a panacea. Under doctor's orders I can proceed with my section hikes this year with my final one next spring to Katahdin. However I must limit the daily mileage based upon daily miles and elevation and the degree to which I experience pain or continued swelling of the affected area.What has helped me determine how far I should hike any given day is gauging the severity of the daily elevation changes. To this end I have calculated a simple number which I call the ESF. It is calculated this way; using the 2017 A.T. Guide by David Miller, I aggregate the total elevation differences per line entry for a planned daily hike. For example, say I'm going from Wildcat Shelter in NY at mile point 1374.0 to Fingerboard Shelter at 1388.3.   I take the differences of each elevation line starting with 1194 ft(in far right column) with the next line, which in this example would be Wawayanda State Park (1149 ft). Add this amount to the difference between the next line , ie. Warwick Turnpike, 1140 ft.and so on for each line entry up to and including 1388.3 feet noted at Fingerboard Shelter. Consider negative numbers as positive. Doing the math the sum of these individual line item differences is 4288 ft. Divide this my the miles between the 2 shelters (14.5, including the off trail distance of 0.2W from Wildcat Shelter), resulting in an ESF of 296. On a subjective scale of 1 to 5 (5 being difficult) I rate this hike a 3. My point to this is that depending the condition of your limb ny given day, this gauge of difficulty will aid you in your decision to perhaps targeting a shorter distance for that particular day or the next day and so on. It may determine when or if you a take a Zero or 1/2 Zero day.Hopefully this is helpful in planning your trip.",,Discussion of Elevation Severity Factor (,"Mar 14, Tue",0
Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560389,"I pushed up my starting date for this spring's section hike from Vernon, NJ to Rutland Vt to April 20 from previously planned April 25. The weather has been cooperating and I am anxious to get on the trail.My thru hike last year was cut short to 355 miles during August due to severe knee pain later diagnosed as osteoarthritis. I have since been rehabilitating my left knee with exercise and 3 injections of Euflexxa in the left knee joint over the last 3 weeks. The Euflexxa acts as a temporary cartilage buffer providing relief from bone on bone pain. I'm anxious to see how the knee reacts under my starting pack weight of 43 lbs. Due to the knee condition I plan to average about 9 1/2 miles per day which will take me to Rutland around 5/27/17, a total of 344 miles. During my attempted thru hike last year I was averaging a little over 13 mi. per day.I've added some entries in the gear section of the journal and will add more later.Any questions, please sign in to the guestbook",,Rutland VT,"Apr 19, Wed",0

Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584338,"I originally planned to start from the Bear Mtn bridge from the Trailside museum & zoo over the Hudson on up to Rutland Vt from April into May. Then during August I was to hike from Pearisburg VA to Rockfish Gap VA.  Gave it more thought and decided to do both sections together at once. Early April I will fly directly down to Pearisburg and onto Rockfish Gap, then after a zero fly directly to Bear Mtn bridge on up to Rutland by early June. I will bus it back home from Rutland.  This scenario offers pros such as (1) an unbroken section hike where my legs will be in better form; (2) the period April into June is less hot and humid; (3) avoid hurricane season(where last year I got nailed in the Smokies). Avoid having to rent a car from my home in Pennsylvania up to Bear Mtn in NY.  Already made hostel and shuttle contacts to avoid surprises.  More on my progress later.
