Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548321,"I've been lurking around this site for a while and finally decided to start my own journal. I have been planning a flip-flop thru-hike in 2018 on the Appalachian for several years and have been making preparations for this already. I will probably only make occasional posts about my preparations until the actual hike starts. Hopefully I can help readers who may be contemplating the same thing, perhaps meet a few writers on the trail, and clarify my own thoughts about why I feel compelled to make this undertaking. I will be turning 55 that year and hope to be starting a glide-path into retirement. Feel free to join me with both my preparations and the actual hike!",,Signing In,"Sep 11, Sun",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548389,"I've wanted to hike the Appalachian for several years. I had read Bill Bryson's book back in 2013 and have been making plans for an eventual hike for several years. In 2014, after two people suggested I read the book ""Wild"" (on the same day!) and then saw the movie, I thought more about planning a hike. After that, a friend suggested I read ""AWOL on the Appalachian Trail"". Reading some of these books cemented the plan. Last year several things happened which crystallized my plans to actually embark on a hike. First, my father died. At the age of 87 with some pre-existing health problems, his death wasn't particularly unexpected. However, losing your parents doesn't happen very often and will cause one to reflect on their own mortality. Later that year, my older sister also died from a malignant brain tumor. This really made me start thinking about how I was spending my life. That summer, I had suffered a bad calf injury while playing church league softball (torn medial head of gastrocnemius). This took just over 8 weeks to heal before I stopped limping. I thought this simply might have been bad luck, but approximately 2 weeks after my calf stopped hurting, I popped out a hernia. I had that fixed this past January. All of these items combined to make me realize that if I didn't hike the Appalachian soon, I would probably never do this. I realized that 2018 would be a good choice as my youngest child will be graduating from high school, my final mortgage would be paid off, and I would be celebrating my 55th birthday and the 30th anniversary of my graduation from medical school. That's probably enough for this post. I've been formulating enough additional topics already that I decided to stop lurking and throw my hat into the 2018 class of hikers.",,View Entry,"Sep 12, Mon",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548563,"I never camped as a kid. My parents simply never did this so I was never exposed to it. I did find that I enjoyed day-hiking and met some friends who were campers and I decided to try a backpacking trip when I was 27. My first night outside was in the backyard or one of my friends as he wanted to make sure I could pitch a tent and knew how my gear worked. Following this experience, I did a Sierra Club backpacking trip in a canyon in the Coconino National Forest near Sedona, AZ. During that trip I remembered an encounter with a ringtail which was trying to steal some of my food. Following that I moved to Wisconsin and did two more Sierra Club trips; to the Trinity Alps of northern California, and to the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore on the upper peninsula of Michigan. I also did a moderate amount of camping on my own land (including doing some winter camping in sub-zero temperatures. However after I met my wife, my camping nearly stopped for many years as she really didn't like the woods. Her idea of ""roughing it"" is to sleep with the windows or to stay in a hotel without a pool. I only started to camp again after my son joined the Boy Scouts. I really enjoyed these experiences and I may have learned nearly as much as my son did. I even became a Scoutmaster for several years. I have camped over 125 nights during Scouting activities and became much more comfortable in the woods. As I became more of an outdoorsman, I enjoyed new challenges. Now that my son has almost earned his Eagle rank, I am looking for further challenges. The Appalachian Trail has been calling my name.",,View Entry,"Sep 13, Tue",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548647,"My re-introduction to the outdoors really started back in 2006 when I discovered geocaching. I found my very first geocache with my brother-in-law in Central Park in NYC while I was back out east for my mother's funeral. After that I became an avid geocacher. I have now found over 3000 geocaches in 36 states and 15 foreign countries. However, my time spent geocaching evaporated when my son became a Boy Scout. I did a lot of day-hiking on trails finding many geocaches and also did a moderate amount of bushwhacking between caches. I developed my map-reading skills and became more comfortable in the outdoors. While on the Appalachian Trail, I hope to do a limited amount of geocaching. I am setting a goal to find one geocache is all 14 states the AT travels through. For sure, I will want to add to my state total as I have not found caches in Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland and Vermont. Through geocaching.com it is possible to create a pocket query with every geocache within a 1/4 mile of the trail. However, I know that I will probably not attempt to find many caches as my hiking velocity really slows down while caching. I will also probably not bring my good gps as I can still find caches using my phone. Do you know of anyone else who has found geocaches on the Appalachian Trail?
P.S. Because I recently made my third post, my journal is now listed in the class of 2018. I've already had my guest book signed. I am enjoying this site so far!",,View Entry,"Sep 14, Wed",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548784,"Without a doubt, the Scouting experience which most accentuated my desire to do an Appalachian thru-hike was Philmont. Philmont Scout Ranch is the largest youth camp in the world encompassing over 140,000 acres (with agreements in place for Scouts to traverse over 300,000 acres). Every year over 20,000 Scouts go on a trek at this ranch in northeastern New Mexico. I first attended a training course at Philmont in 2014. During that trip, we were able to do a 3 mile hike into the backcountry and stayed overnight. Besides enjoying the course, I loved the camping and the natural beauty. I even got to hear elk bugling for the first time. I also realized that I wanted to see more mountains. I resolved to try to do a full trek. I finally got the opportunity to go on a 90 mile trek with my son this past July. This was a great experience for both me and my son. Adults are supposed to let the youth (whom are all older Boy Scouts) lead and it was gratifying to see how much my son matured during this week. Besides getting to scale four mountains over 9000 feet (including Mount Baldy at 12,441 feet above sea level), we were also able to enjoy programming at many staff camps in the backcountry. These all had different themes such as horse-riding, gold and copper mining, cattle ranching, timber harvesting, and pioneer settling. We even got to visit Kit Karson's home when he lived on the property. My only regret is that I will probably not be able to go back because my son will be aging out of the Boy Scouts. Besides the trip itself, our crew had to do several shakedown hikes. We traveled out of state several times (to Iowa and Minnesota) for two of these hikes to find larger hills and longer trails. These gave me the opportunity to experiment with different combinations of gear as I prepared for the big hike. These were invaluable experiences as I now feel I have a reasonably good idea about what I want to bring with me on the Appalachian. I have met several other backpackers who got their start because of Philmont. Have you been there?",,View Entry,"Sep 15, Thu",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548954,"The Ice Age Trail stretches for over 1000 miles in Wisconsin roughly following the edge of the last round of glaciation. There are many stretches where the trail travels along roads, but gradually more and more areas are in the woods. Camping is allowed in all sections on public land. Before I traveled to Philmont, I had trained a lot on the Ice Age Trail. While my area of Wisconsin is relatively flat, the Ice Age Trail follows a series of hills associated with glacial remains. My usual process was to hike roughly five miles and then hike back to the parking area (all wearing my backpack). This year, I was able to traverse all wooded sections between St. Croix Falls and Rice Lake. This training made Philmont relatively easy. I had to attend a meeting in faculty development meeting in Wausau this past Friday. Because our Troop didn't have enough boys who wanted to attend the district Fall Camporee, I found myself with a free weekend. My wife didn't want me to be away the entire weekend, but she did let me campout Friday night on the way home and then so some hiking on Saturday. I chose the Ice Age Trail and decided to use the opportunity as another shakedown hike. On Friday evening, I found the parking area and hiked in two miles to a stealth camp. I was successfully able to hang a bear bag (using the PCT style) which I had never done before as the Scouts have a different way to hang bear bags. This was relatively easy. I also got my campsite set up quickly so I was in bed before it got completely dark. I was even able to read for a while before trying to go to sleep. The night was fairly warm and I found myself actually removing layers during the night. However, I woke up numerous times for unclear reasons. I tend to be a good sleeper in the woods, but I know the first night of any hike can be a bit harder to sleep. The weather forecast had initially called for a chance of rain. While the trail was wet from heavy rains earlier on Friday, the rain stopped and it largely remained dry (but overcast) the entire two-day hike.",,Highway 64 (Mile 223.9) to Stealth Campsite,"Sep 15, Thu",2
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548960,"Because the nights are getting increasingly longer, and because I didn't sleep the best, I was up by dawn. I quickly packed up ensuring that my site was not obvious. I then hiked long enough until I crossed a milestone in case I ever try to complete this section from the other side of this section of the Chequamagon National Forest. The day was overcast but except for a few sprinkles, it remained dry. I followed the trail's yellow blazes which were fairly easy to follow. I was amazed at how much fall color had developed within just a few days. Several days prior there had been hardly any color. Now suddenly, the woods had a lot of yellow, particularly the basswoods, birches, and a few maples. We finally had a bit of cold weather earlier this week which will start the leaves changing, but I hadn't seen it change quite so quickly. We are still far from peak, but it is now obvious that winter is coming. During the 20 miles I hiked, I met four people. Two were a young couple who had a illegal fire right in the middle of the trail. The other were two older women who are retired and are finishing up section hiking the entire Ice Age Trail. I was surprised that we knew some common friends, and one of the ladies even had a college roommate in Chicago who was from my hometown of Valhalla, NY. I experimented with several items today. First, I used Leukotape on myself over some small blisters and this held up quite well. Second, Amazon Prime just announced a new benefit of a limited Audible.com membership. I listened to several short stories when I had no internet coverage (including Edgar Allen Poe's ""The Pit and the Pendulum"". This worked quite well as long as the I had cell phone coverage. I had previously downloaded a Audible copy of an Appalachian Trail travelogue ""Hiking Through"" by Paul Stutzman and I finished that book. While I usually don't have enough free time to justify an Audible subscription, I will probably obtain this prior to the Appalachian Trail as a good book goes a long way towards combating boredom. There is only a limited amount of free material on the Amazon Prime membership so far. Third, I started using a new workout app ""Endomundo"". This worked well as long as I kept my phone on. However, when I went to airplane mode to save battery life, it essentially stopped working (so I'm not really sure how valuable this will be. Fourth, I started using the Sawyer Squeeze Bag. Previously when I used the Sawyer Squeeze, I would fill up a SmartWater bottle and simply drink from the bottle. However, the bag does work better (but it takes a bit longer to filter). Finally, I also experimented with several different types of snack bars. I think ProBars are my favorite (after trying them for the first time at Philmont. However, Cliff Bars are fairly good as well. I wasn't as impressed with some King Bars. Overall, this was a great way to spend a day. I hit more than 40000 steps on my FitBit for only the 5th time. I also tended to hike miles at a consistent 17 minute/mile pace (until the very end of the day) which included all short stops and stream crossings. This is a lot slower than my road walking speed of just under 14 minutes/mile (yes I walk quickly).",,Lake 11 Campsite to Highway 64,"Sep 16, Fri",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549206,"Today I did a day-hike on the Superior Hiking Trail. The Superior Hiking Trail runs between the Canadian border along Lake Superior and eventually ends south of Duluth where it runs into Wisconsin. It is part of the North Country Trail. It is almost completed with only a few sections on roads or bike trails (mostly around the urban area of Duluth). Backpacker magazine identified the Superior Hiking Trail as one of the 10 best backpacking trails in the country. The trail is marked with blue blazes. I was initially introduced to the trail this past June when our Boy Scout crew did a 20 mile hike on a section of this trail when we were preparing for Philmont. When I returned from Philmont, I established the goal to hike all 270 miles of this trail by the end of 2017 as training before I head out east on the Appalachian. After this past weekend's long hike, I did have a small blister on the tip of one of my toes. I wanted to get in one additional hike prior to a long one coming up next week where I will be doing 5 days on the most northernmost part of the Superior Hiking Trail - between the Canadian border and Grand Marais. I want to get in some nice hiking before the weather turns nasty up here. I am usually on call in the Emergency Room overnight on Mondays. Because I tend to have Tuesdays off, I hope to do the lower sections of the trail as day hikes (as camping opportunities are very limited anyway in this section of the trail). Hopefully I can do another few day hikes before short day-lengths prevent me from making the long drive up here. This section of the trail was quite remote. I only ran into a few hikers who were enjoying the fall weather (particularly because the bugs are gone and it isn't cold yet). I walked a five mile section of the trail and then returned to my car. I have now finished the first 15 miles north of Jay Cooke State Park. I was also a bit surprised to find that while Duluth is significantly further north than Wausau, there was less fall color here. I also decided to find a few geocaches. One cache had not been found for over a year. At the site, it was apparent that a stump had collapsed into thousands of pieces. I dug through this and eventually discovered a toy rat with a bison tube inside. I realized that early in my AT hike, I WILL probably want to do some geocaching - simply to slow me down and limit my mileage for the first several weeks. According to a new app (which I will probably write about in a future post), I hiked 10.02 miles over 2 hrs and 58 minutes (not counting a few breaks when I paused the app). Altitudes varied between 587 feet and 1132 feet above sea-level. My total ascent was 16,132 feet (211 floors according to my FitBit). These times are faster than I would ordinarily backpack as I only carried a day pack, three liters of water, and some snacks. Having hills like this is exactly why I chose to drive this far to get some better training before the Appalachian.",,Barden's Peak to Spirit Mountain,"Sep 20, Tue",10
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549277,"I was invited to the Minnesota Rovers weekly meeting this past Tuesday. Because of the distance involved combined with my prior plans to use my day off hiking I was unable to attend. However, there was a very interesting topic, ""What it takes to hike the Appalachian Trail"". It was put on by Paul ""Good Enough"" Ebert who did an AT thru-hike in 2015. Only five of the requirements were posted beforehand and the last was discussed during his talk. I was able to find out the last need through correspondence with the Rover who had posted the invitation. I will discuss my thoughts as to whether I am ready for a hike myself. I invite any readers to do the same. The first requirement is TIME. I have already requested (and had approved) the time off from work. The only difficulty here relates to possibly losing insurance certifications if I am not practicing for more than six months. I may be finished within six months. However, I will probably work for a few days when I come back home for my son's high school graduation in late May. I am sure that many of my long-term patients would like to see me and hear some stories at the same time. I am fortunate that experienced family physicians are in high demand (the most requested medical specialty according to headhunting firms) so I could practice nearly anywhere in the country. The second requirement is ENERGY. I tend to have lots of energy. I know I am slowing down as I age but this trek is only 18 months away so I am not too concerned about this need currently. The third requirement is MONEY. More than expected cash is needed for gear, hotel/hostel stays, food, and dealing with unforeseen events. Because I have never done anything like this before and I have been a good saver through the years, I should be able to handle any expenses. (But I will still likely tend to be a bit frugal as family doctors don't usually get paid as well as specialists in the US health care system). The fourth requirement is MOTIVATION. I have been considering this for a long time and have worked through myriad reasons why I want to do a hike. I also tend to be stubborn when I am in pursuit of my goals. At this point I am not too worried about this need. The fifth requirement is KNOWLEDGE. Through all my reading, my experience as a Scoutmaster as well as a moderate amount of real-life backpacking, I feel I will be more prepared than the average thru-hiker. I know there will still be a lot to learn but most of what I don't know (best resupplies, hostels, etc.) will be taught along the trail. The last requirement according to this speaker is LUCK. Many people fail to finish because of injury or sickness that occurred on the trail. Luck is also needed to not have a major family crisis during the time on the trail which would force me to stop. I am most worried about this need as 2015 was unlucky for me with several personal injuries and family deaths. I am praying that the man upstairs watches over me to enable me to complete this hike. Do you feel any needs are missing from this list?",,View Entry,"Sep 23, Fri",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549986,"I had a few extra vacation days to use up before the fiscal year ends on September 30th. I decided to take a five day backpacking trip on the northernmost section of the Superior Hiking Trail. I arranged for a shuttle leaving early Wednesday from Grand Marais. However, to ensure that I was able to get on the trail early, I had to find a place to stay locally after the four hour drive to get up there. Rather than simply staying at a hotel, I found out about a new hostel near Grand Marais and decided to stay there. I had never stayed at a hostel before and know that I will likely be staying at more than one while on the Appalachian Trail. The hostel only opened up a few months ago. They already have had a lot of international visitors. While it had been sold out for the days prior and every day through the coming weekend, I was the only guest staying this night. The owner had put many nice touches on the building including using many types of recycled woods (including picnic tables). He did comment that this building was fancier than most of the hostels I would experience along the Appalachian. There were private rooms available on the lower level and bunkroom accommodations on the upper level. I had stopped at a Wal-Mart in Duluth to stock on on foodstuffs and was able to spread out and arrange my food. The owner had thru-hiked the Appalachian in 2009 and did offer some specific suggestions as planning for five days of food was a bit daunting. While I never really got much of the social experience, I am looking forward to staying at more hostels in the future.",,"Grand Marais, MN","Sep 27, Tue",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550043,"Today I left the Hungry Hippie Hostel and drove to a parking lot on the Superior Hiking Trail near Grand Marais. I then caught a pre-arranged shuttle at 7am. The drive took over an hour as much of it was on muddy dirt roads. While yesterday's rain had stopped, the weather was definitely overcast and there was still occasional drizzle. I was dropped off at Otter Lake Road and then had to hike north just over a mile to 270 degree overlook which is the northern terminus of the Superior Hiking Trail (and the Eastern terminus of the Border Route Trail which goes across the Boundary Waters Area into North Dakota but is not completely finished). From this overlook, the Pigeon River was visible. Everything to the south of this landmark is in the US and everything to the north is Canadian. After this brief hike, I started my trek south. My car was 53 miles away. The day got off to a slow start as I slipped and fell within the first 10 minutes on the muddy terrain. I then lost the trail nearly immediately (as the trail has been usurped as a logging road for a short time). As a result, the first mile of the trail heading south from the parking lot was a big muddy mess. After this, the trail was easy to follow and relatively well-maintained. I visited the highest point on the Superior Hiking Trail (1829 feet above sea level). The leaves had significant color, but because this area is somewhat boreal, there weren't as many bright maples as we have farther south with far more birch, aspen and spruce trees. At one campsite, I found a geocache without even looking for it (stumbled over it by pure luck). Another highlight was getting a view of Isle Royale (in Lake Superior) from Hellacious Overlook. I covered about 17 miles (my FitBit recorded 37,145 steps and 281 flights of stairs). I saw one person the entire day (a retired high school physics teacher from Horicon Wis, who was dayhiking much of the trail after recovering from several joint replacements. I had the campsite completely to myself. I started an Audible book ""Dreamsongs"" which is a compilation of George R.R. Martin's (the author of the books on which the ""Game of Thrones"" is based on) early short stories. I may have pushed myself a bit further than I had initially planned but felt quite good overall.

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550116,"Even though I had had a busy day, I was surprised that I didn't sleep as well as I thought. Part of it was related to not finding a tree high enough to be sure that a bear could not reach my bear bag. Part of it was related to the fact that the nights are fairly long and I don't need 12 hrs of sleep. I hit the trail within 1/2 hr after dawn. I hadn't really planned another long day, but after analyzing the campsite distribution, I realized I would either have to do a very short day or hike another long day. The day had me hike through a state park with a prominent geologic landmark called the Devil's Kettle. The site has an optical illusion that a waterfall empties into a bowl like structure and has no outflow. However, by hiking from the north, I was able to see where the water went. I saw a lot of people in the state park but otherwise it was another quiet day. I passed two other backpackers. My campsite this night was on the shores of a river which provided a wonderful audible backdrop for the evening. While I had my campsite entirely to myself, practically on the other side of the trail was another campsite which had three backpackers. Two men and one of their sons had been section hiking the trail for years and were finally finishing it. I sat with them around a fire for a while before retiring.

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550150,"I slept well last night. Perhaps it was the babbling river, or perhaps it was because I knew that my bear bag was well-secured above any potential foragers. I even overslept a bit not getting on the trail until after 8am. The highlight for the day occurred early as I was able to walk on the beach of Lake Superior for 1.5 miles, the only place on the trail where the Superior Hiking Trail is directly on the water. Today also had the best weather of the trip so far with some bright sun and reasonably warm temperatures (mid 60's. I particularly enjoyed relaxing in a large mountain meadow with a nice view of the Lake (which was now quite far away again after climbing along the Kadunce River. According to my FitBit, I walked 31609 steps and climbed the equivalent of 220 flights of stairs. I retired a bit earlier and today shared a campsite with three other people, a married couple whose husband and I shared some nice conversation about gear. He was also a gear junkie and who had very nice taste as he also had a Z-packs tent and an Enlightened Equipment sleeping quilt (which I had been using all year and have been very happy with). The final person was a woman who worked for the Superior Hiking Trail Association dealing with landowner relations and who had thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail about 6 years ago. While I would have thought that she might be more social (and I was able to talk with her for a while), she largely kept to her tent all evening and then left first thing in the morning (to go further north as part of a guided hike. While I usually take pride that I tend to be one of the first people to get going in the morning, she was fully packed and ready to go far faster than I(showing that an Appalachian Thru-hiker gets very efficient).",,Woods Creek Campsite,"Sep 30, Fri",15
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550175,"I slept well last night and got an early start on the day. Because I had done three big days, I only had to hike five miles to make it back to my car. These went uneventfully. I took a side hike up to the top of Pincushion Mountain to get internet and see the view (pictured). I then returned to my car. Because I still had a fair amount of time, I debated between catching another shuttle 20 miles south and hiking back or hiking on a different section of the trail. After waiting for a while and loading up on some food which I had in my car, I decided to hike on a different section of the trail. The lower portion of the trail (between Duluth and Two Harbors) has somewhat of a bad reputation. I decided to save the nicer parts for future weekend trips and start getting some of this other section done. I found a section with an appropriate distance and made the drive there (north of Two Harbors, MN). The trail was gorgeous here. There were fewer spruce trees but far more maples and they were at peak (part of the reason I chose this section was because the guidebook mentioned a mature maple forest). I was also worried about not finding a camping site as the potential camping sites were both quite close to parking areas (and I had heard that the trail can become busy on Saturdays). As I drove south, I was glad I made this decision as all the parking lots in the northern part of the trail were overflowing (mostly with dayhikers who wanted to do some hiking when the leaves were out and there were no bugs (and the weather was gorgeous). The trail further south was much more lightly traveled as I only saw a few day-hikers and one group of backpackers who used the other campsite in this section. Because I had no shuttle, I had to walk back and forth to finish out a section. I finally settled down at McCarthy Creek which I had to myself and which was idyllic with another reasonably loud babbling brook. It just didn't have any mature trees to hang a bear bag so I had to keep my food in my tent with me. This was the lightest day of my trip as I only hiked 28,507 steps and climbed the equivalent of 224 flights of stairs. So far, except for my toes, I have been loving this trip (which has further enhanced my desire to hike the Appalachian).",,McCarthy Creek Campsite,"Oct 01, Sat",12
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550254,"Another night of poor sleep. I can't seem to stay asleep for 12 hrs. I know that part of this related to having my food in my tent. Around 1 am, I woke up and wasn't sleepy at all. I listened to an entire ""This American Life"" podcast without headphones partly to discourage critters, but I stayed awake for the entire podcast. I did hear a pack of wolves howling briefly in the distance. I got going first thing the next morning. I trekked the three miles back to my car and because I still had plenty of time, I hiked the next section of the trail to the west there and back (~12 miles). I enjoyed both of these sections and didn't understand why some hikers have bashed the lower section of the trail. I only ran into two backpackers the entire day. One had backpacked from Duluth and said there was about a 10 mile stretch where the trail was only a grassy wayside. The rest, including this section were beautiful. Because there are no shuttles in this section, it is a bit harder to traverse. One of the backpackers was visiting from Houston, TX. He is a recently retired geologist taking early retirement from an oil company. He had a T-shirt from a Boy Scout Troop in Houston. I found out that he had been on a Philmont trek himself within the past several years. It's a bit surprising how many backpackers got their start with the Scouts. When I returned back to my car, I started the drive home. When I returned home, I still had enough energy to do a three mile walk with my dog. Overall on this last day, I walked 39515 steps and climbed the equivalent of 173 flights of stairs. I finished another 9 sections of the Superior Hiking Trail (I have now finished 24 out of 49 trail sections, but only 127 of the 300+ miles). By finishing up more than 100 miles on this trail, I now qualify for a patch from the North Country Trail Association. Hopefully I can finish the rest of this trail during the next year prior to starting on the Appalachian Trail. The Superior Hiking Trail is a beautiful trail. It gets enough usage that the trail tends to be easy to follow. People who have hiked the Appalachian say that this trail is similar to the AT. There are still lots of hills even though they aren't as prolonged as the AT. Resupply tends to be harder on the SHT as this is largely passing through remote territory. Even when the trail crosses a road, the majority of the time these are only gravel roads which are very lightly traveled so hitching into town for a resupply would be quite difficult. It was nice to see that I was able to do consecutive big days (for me). I learned a lot more about how to resupply and distribute my food (and realized that until hiker hunger kicks in I won't need to carry as much food early on in the hike). This was a great preparatory hike. I found that listening to media made the miles slip by much faster. I was still able to enjoy the trail and took more than 100 photos. The biggest downside of the trip related to my toenails. While the rest of me held up surprisingly well, my feet did suffer on this trip. I had never really had significant problems with my toenails. I was even able to avoid all blisters this trip. However, five of my toenails appear to have blood underneath them after this long hike. I doubt this would slow me down if this happens again on the AT as I do recall losing a single toenail in the past related to excessive hiking. I do know I had trimmed my toenails within 48 hrs of going on the trail and my hiking boots are a full size larger than my regular shoes. I guessed that my feet were more swollen than on prior hikes for some reason. During the last two days, I abandoned my outer socks and only hiked in the liners. I never see people carrying toenail clippers on the trail. How do they trip their nails? I still have a bit of weight shaving to do off my pack, but if it were possible, I would consider myself trail-ready for a 2017 hike (which is impossible given my work and family situation).",,Home,"Oct 02, Sun",18

The requirements to receive this involved hiking 100 miles on the North Country Trail. This is a promotion on for 2016 to celebrate the 100 year anniversary of the National Park Service. This trail is still in formation but will eventually stretch from North Dakota to New York up to the Vermont border. There are negotiations going on to eventually linnk the trail to the Appalachian Trail, making it possible to hike from Georgia to North Dakota. Because the Superior Hiking Trail is part of the North Country Trail, I fulfilled the requirements for this badge during my last backpacking trip. While my son has earned lots of these patches through the Boy Scouts, it is nice for an adult to earn one at times as well (even though I have already earned enough training awards and honors that my Boy Scout uniform makes me look a bit like an African dictator!).

I completely agree with his sentiments. However, I have too many other commitments until 2018 (when I am trying to clear everything from my schedule). I have to bide my time until then. I have been using the www.walking4fun.com website to virtually hike the Appalachian Trail. The link automatically syncs up with my FitBit and everyday I can log in to the site and see pictures from the section of the trail that I would have walked based on my mileage. The pictures were taken several years ago by Ryan ""Tortuga"" Carpenter when he did his own thru-hike. While I really like checking out the trail, there are a few features I wish could be improved. If you don't sign in one day, you don't get to see the pictures from the prior day. In addition, there is no way to go back and check old photographs. Otherwise, seeing pictures from the trail and making slow but steady progress is giving me a much better idea about the layout and the scope of the trail. To finish the virtual hike before we leave on the real trail, a person starting now would need to walk an average of about four miles daily. There are many other trails available on this site (after you finish the Appalachian).

Unfortunately, by the time I was able to get out again, nearly all the leaves are already off the trees. I had this afternoon off so I made the drive to Duluth and started hiking, trying to get another section of the Superior Hiking Trail completed. According to the Endomondo app which I have been using recently, I was only able to cover 7 miles (only 3 1/2 miles of the actual trail as I had to backtrack back to my car) partially because daylengths have shortened significantly. I have enjoyed the Endomondo app as it tracks actual distance rather than simply my FitBit, and can be used when the phone is in airplane mode as long as locations are enabled. The day was beautiful with temperatures in the high 50's. This section of the trail largely paralleled Interstate 35. I was happy to have an Audible.com book to listen to such that I barely perceived the traffic noise. It was great to get out into the woods again. On some of the uphills, I could tell that my thighs were squawking a bit simply from not using them on my walks around home. I'll try to get in a few more hikes if I can.

Over the past several years, I have been doing far more walking than I had done in years past. Much of my training was done with my Labrador retriever as I would regularly start walking more than three miles (often well after dark), partially to get in shape (develop foot callouses) and partially to improve my fitness/watch my weight by increasing my step counts. Having to take my dog on a walk would often force me to take the first step to get outside. Two nights ago, I went on a four mile hike with my dog. During the last mile, I noticed the dog was limping significantly. However, he was able to keep up my usual pace and didn't seem to be in significant pain so I finished the walk as I figured he may have stepped onto something. However, that night he didn't even eat the treats I would usually give after a long hike. Yesterday he was in much more obvious pain and then he started shaking. My wife took him to the vet and he was quickly diagnosed with bone cancer. As he was 12 years old (on his birthday), and we had known that he had started to fail in other ways, we had the vet put him down. That dog had lots of energy. Probably too much - as he never really settled into the proper house dog my family would have preferred. He had been field bred. His grandfather had been a Minnesota Hunting Dog Champion. We had not realized that this meant that he would never really lose his natural puppy energy. As a result, we were rarely able to let him live in our home so he was usually confined to our entryway. However, he really seemed to like the long walks I would take with him. I know many people bring their dogs on the AT. While I can understand how many people think their dogs will help with companionship as well as defense against bears, personally I really don't think that dogs belong on the AT. I had been planning on leaving my dog home anyway. Now I know that he won't be left behind.....Considering that I will be leaving for the AT in 16 1/2 months, I do not believe I will get another dog immediately. However, I was a bit disappointed to realize that when I came home last night, I didn't go for a walk (although in my defense, I was doing last minute preparations for a Boy Scout campout which I will be attending this weekend. I will be teaching the First Aid Merit Badge during the weekend). In the future, it will seem odd to be walking far away from my home without having a dog as an excuse.

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551413,"Today marks a minor milestone. 500 days from today I plan to start my hike on the Appalachian Trail! While I know that this is still more than a year away, I have been counting down for at least 200 days already using the Final Countdown app. https://fncd.net/ Previous to having this app, I had been planning on a different start date (around my 55th birthday) and I had been monitoring the time left before that date for over 100 months. The app even accounts for daylight savings if you wanted to count down the hours (~12,000), minutes (~720500) or seconds (~43235000) until departure. I have been surprised at how often I check that app. I find it a bit disconcerting to be so focused on something this long in the future. Everything I have read suggests living in the present as much as possible and trying not to worry excessively about the past nor the future. However, I do know that whenever I am having a bad day, checking that app seems to have a calming influence as I remember that the momentary stresses of today are temporary. I know that I counted down for more than a year before my trip to Philmont this past July and for more than a year before a trip to Europe the prior year. I also like to surprise my kids with a special treat coming out of the blue when they have aged another 1000 days. Having something to look forward to really seems to help settle my nerves.

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551632,"Over the last several years, I have started to feel my age. I will officially become OLD on the Appalachian Trail. I mentioned in my last post that I like numbers. I have been tracking my age in days since I turned 7000 days old (back in college). I even proposed to my wife on the day she turned 1 billion seconds old (which coincided with my birthday). I realized that a typical life is about 30,000 days long (about 81 years). From that number, you can calculate that during the first 10,000 days, you are young (about 27 1/3). The next 10,000 days you are middle aged (until about 54 3/4 years old). Unfortunately, I have only 495 days left until I enter my final third (God-willing - as there are obvious no guarantees). I have already jokingly started to refer to myself as being old. Unfortunately, it will be true soon. While I still feel young, I want to make the most of the life I have left. I know the first third of my life was dedicated to my education and maturation. I even had a small party (a Farewell to Youth party!) with the other Family Medicine Residents when I was in residency. The middle third of my life has been largely devoted to career and raising a family. I hope to make the most of my final third. How better to start my dotage than to be doing something epic like starting an Appalachian Trail thru-hike? When I realized this milestone was taking place on March 30, 2018, I realized that I had to start my trek around that date. I decided to start hiking the day before so that when midnight came on my 20,000th day, I would be out in the woods doing something I loved. I don’t know what specifically I will be doing after this hike. I might be able to retire early. However, I still feel at the top of my game practicing medicine and I know I can leave a larger legacy if I continue working. However, I am likely to start slowing down (either practicing only three days a week or taking far more vacation time (12 weeks or perhaps even longer?)). I might even move to a different part of the country (probably less rural). One of my personal goals for my time on the Appalachian Trail is to figure out how to best spend the time I have left.

Some of this is because I have been busy, but as I foresaw, not having to take the dog for a walk didn't force me to start walking. Last week I only had 56,000 steps which was a new low since my hernia surgery. As a result, last week I decided to go out an purchase a treadmill. I had always chosen in the past to use an indoor exercise bicycle for exercise, but as I had been preparing for Philmont this previous spring, I realized that nothing really compared to walking. If I am going to really build up callouses on my feet, I will need to use my treadmill for training (possibly even with a pack and hiking boots). I purchased one which goes up to a 15% grade so I can even practice some extended hill-climbing. My wife had also asked about purchasing a treadmill as well as she wanted to start using one as well. It was delivered today. My first night on it, I walked 4.5 miles while I watched a movie on television.

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553414,"One of the traditions of an Appalachian Trail thru-hike involves Trail Names. Nearly all thru-hikers have Trail Names given to them. While they are typically named on the trail, many writers on this site already have their trail names established. I wondered what my own trail name would be. Some Trail Names seemed a bit frivolous or commonplace to me. I wanted a name which would be distinctive but would also be descriptive. I know I was probably worrying about this issue far more than I should have. But because I am feeling more confident in my general level of backpacking skills and my gear is coming together reasonably well, I suppose I had to be concerned about something! lol During a hike last fall, a new possible trail name dawned on me. I thought about this name and the more I considered it, the more I liked the idea. I have read in books, blogs, and vlogs how other hikers acquired their trail names and heard of several people who suggested possibilities to established thru-hikers so I decided to make this suggestion. I live in a tiny town so I have little access to other thru-hikers. I had made some contact with Craig M (trail name ""Spielberg"") who successfully thru-hiked last year and made a wonderful series of videos along the way. He is also from New York and is more mature than many of the hikers just out of school. Check out his YouTube channel if you haven't already done so. https://www.youtube.com/channe...
After corresponding with him expressing my appreciation for creating his videos and asking several unrelated questions, I floated the idea of a Trail Name to Craig. He liked the idea and was happy to christen me with this trail name. He seemed happy to do this as he told me he had never bestowed a trail name during his own hike. 
I am from New York and then moved to a small northern town to provide medical services in exchange for having my medical school loans paid off (through the National Health Services Corps). These facts draw obvious comparisons to the fictional character Joel Fleischman. Fleischman was the lead star in the hit TV show ""Northern Exposure"". Northern Exposure aired in the early 90's and won an Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series. This was around the time that I moved to northern Wisconsin. I identified with many of his exploits. I also recently found out from ""23 and Me"" that 0.3% of my DNA is Ashkenazi Jewish (as Joel was Jewish). 
As such, I am honored to be named ""Fleischman"".   
I know the name may not resonate with younger hikers who may not have even been born when this show was on the air. Some people may only think the name refers to margarine. Some of you may not like the idea of either suggesting a trail name or having it created prior to actually hiking the trail but I know the choice to accept a trail name ultimately comes down to me. The name will also remind people that I am a physician who will be happy to help others along the trail as I am able. But according to Craig, I will not (fortunately!) be expected to carry a fully stocked infirmary in my backpack.

Either the weather has not been very good or I have been too busy in real life. This week, I had to make a business trip down to Milwaukee. After the conference finished around noon on Friday, I decided to try to get a hike in prior to driving home. It was a brisk day. I headed out into 13 degree temperatures with a moderate wind. Fortunately, snow depths around Milwaukee are among the least in the state. I had to walk through 2-3 inches of snow. Fortunately, there were only a few areas which had ice underneath so traction was generally quite good. I had been fighting the flu for a few days prior so I knew my endurance would be poor, but I was able to hike 10 miles averaging around 3 miles/hour (with no weight on my back). I had also recently realized that Guthook (one of the major apps for mapping the AT) also manages the mapping software for the Ice Age Trail. I realize I can become more comfortable with Guthook by hiking other segments of the Ice Age Trail. I will have to take more trips across Wisconsin during the next several years as I was recently elected to the Board of Directors of the Wisconsin Academy of Family Physicians (my next trip will be for a Board meeting in Green Bay in May) but I will also be attending a physician leadership seminar sponsored by the Wisconsin Hospital Association in Kohler, WI in ~5 weeks. Perhaps I can get some hiking on new trails during those trips. I used a new Z-packs fleece hat which worked nicely to keep my head warm. Unfortunately, I really didn't have a lot of my regular gear with me. I even made the hike in cotton dockers pants. I realized that if I want to do more winter hiking, I really need to get some microspikes which I have been reading about recently. I also found a specialty shoe store and purchased some Merrill Moab trail running shoes. I had previously tried on some Cascadia shoes but found my wide feet wouldn't fit into them. This pair of Merrills seemed comfortable. I will have to try them out in the woods soon. It was nice getting out into the woods again (even though the area is being managed to bring back Savannah type species by being burned regularly and was therefore quite open). I can't wait for spring to try out some of my other new purchases (such as an Ursack which my wife purchased for me for Christmas. I am considering bringing this with me on the AT). I also have a new lightweight (~25 grams) Vapur Incognito flask to carry up to 10 ounces of an adult beverage (something I would have enjoyed during many of my Boy Scout camping trips). I also have been reconsidering how my hike will work. I am now thinking about covering much of Virginia in April and May and then return home for a few weeks to celebrate my son's high school graduation (and to change out my gear and recover a bit). When I return to the trail, I now believe I will become a southbounder. Since early June would be the prime time for many people to start SOBO hikes, I will more likely be able to have a trail family but this way I would have already developed my trail legs before the 100 mile wilderness and the White Mountains. Hopefully I would miss the majority of tick season (yes there is definitely a seasonal variation in tick populations which usually peak in May). Hopefully I would also miss the majority of the brutally warm temperatures. While I may still get significant black fly and mosquito swarms, I am moderately used to these living in the north woods of Wisconsin. I would have loved to join other members of the Trails Journals community on their shakedown trek along the Benton Mackay Trail.

The ice went off our lake yesterday (which is about ten days earlier than usual). I saw that the snow was disappearing around Duluth so I decided to head up there to start work on the 190 miles that I have left on the Superior Hiking Trail (out of the total 310 miles). There is still nearly two feet of snow in some locations further north in the Arrowhead. While the snow was largely gone, there was still more ice on the trail than I had expected. In addition, many areas had thawed mud on top of frozen ice below the surface so the trail was slow-going (averaging 24 minutes per mile with only a backpack with three liters of water). I did wipe out once but fortunately didn't seem to get hurt (but I suspect I may change my song tomorrow!). It was still a wonderful day to get outside with sunny weather and temps in the mid-50's. I've been using my treadmill a lot this winter but there really isn't anything like hiking on trails to getting your legs trail-ready. On this trip, I experimented with some new CraftSport Thermal Gloves which seemed quite comfortable. They worked okay but not great with my cell phone (e.g. I don't have a photo with this post as the camera didn't record my picture of the port of Duluth which still had substantial ice floes). They are certainly lightweight and will probably be going on the trail when I start out next year. These would be used for both warmth and blister protection (as I tend to grip my poles too tightly).

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558753,"After day-hiking on the Superior Hiking Trail last week and seeing a favorable weather forecast, I decided to head out on my first backpacking trip of 2017, particularly because I realized this would probably by my last opportunity for at least four weekends before I could attempt another trip. I decided to start the area immediately north of Duluth which is the first area which allows overnight camping. I had been watching snow depths retreating north. I also knew that this was considered among the least appealing areas of the Superior Hiking Trail. However, because I needed to hike this section to do the entire trail, and because the description of all three segments I hiked described the area as ""relatively flat"", I decided to head out. I called the Superior Shuttle Service this past Friday and was able to book a shuttle on Saturday morning. The trip up to Duluth was interesting. After having dinner with my wife, I decided to drive up north and stay overnight in a hotel as my shuttle was supposed to meet me at 8am. I had driven nearly an hour north when I realized that I had forgotten my boots. There was nothing to do about this but drive back, get my boots and restart my trip. Unfortunately I didn't get into my hotel until after midnight. This was not the way the trip was supposed to start! The following morning, I had some difficulty finding the trailhead but was able to be there on time. We started out and I quickly realized I had left my trekking poles in the back of my vehicle. The shuttle driver was pleasant and we backtracked. I am not usually so disorganized. This trip was really not starting well. We reached the trailhead. I got out and immediately realized that there was more ice on the trail than I had expected. The photo with this entry was taken shortly after getting onto the trail. I was quickly realizing this would not be an easy hike. The trailhead had a 0.9 mile hike onto the mail trail and fairly soon, I had to climb a moderate-sized hill (at least it had a decent view!). This was not going to be an easy walk in the woods! I then quickly lost the trail. When the false trail petered out, I backtracked and found I had lost the trail where a wind-fallen tree had blocked the mail pathway. There was still ice nearly the entire way. When I started to reconsider my decision to hike, I found there was absolutely no cell phone signal. I had to hike to get back to my car. The rest of the hike actually went fairly well. It was a warm day (around 50) with minimal wind. I quickly stripped off several layers and learned how to straddle the trail placing my feet on either muddy areas or snow rather than the ice in the center of the trail. The ice also gradually diminished as I headed south. I did wipe out and fall one time but merely landed on my backpack and fortunately was not injured. I crossed one paved road the entire day and did not see another hiker the entire day. I did get lost when the trail went through a logged over area but I eventually realized where the trail was supposed to be. I had hoped the backcountry navigator app would be helpful but I couldn't find where to find the trail. Most of the trail was fairly scenic so I was surprised because I had heard other hikers describe this section as being quite boring. However, because I had to watch the ground so much, I walked by several campsites without even seeing them. At the end of the day, I simply walked into Bald Eagle Campsite as the trail had taken a left and I walked on the spur trail into my campsite. By the time I had set up camp and cooked I had walked over 45,000 steps (although that total was padded by walking around the campsite when I saw how close to 45000 steps I had gotten). This is only the second time I had achieved this milestone during the 3 1/2 years of using my FitBit. As for the ""relatively flat"" terrain, my FitBit recorded me as having ascended 210 flights of stairs. However, I had made it!

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558928,"Even though I hadn't gotten a lot of sleep the night before, I slept fitfully through the night. The night was nippy getting down to the high 20's. I was achy enough that I roused several times with my muscles clamoring when I tried to change positions. I then also had to frequently adjust my quilt to retain my warmth. In hindsight, I probably should have at least taken a Tylenol. This was the first time I used my new Thermarest Neo-Air X-Lite Sleeping pad which I had purchased with a 25% off coupon last fall from REI. I had considered purchasing this before my hike in Philmont, but because I had to share a tent, I didn't think my tent-mate would appreciate the crinkly noise the sleeping pad can produce. Instead I had purchased an REI Flash. Unfortunately, while the pad worked well during our shakedown hikes, halfway through Philmont, this pad sprang a pinhole leak and had to be discarded at the end of that trek. During last fall's trips I had used an older sleeping pad. I really like this new pad. It did take longer to inflate than I would have liked, but I could definitely notice the better insulation this pad gave me. By morning, my breath had condensed into a sheet of ice on the ceiling of my tent, but overall I had kept fairly warm. I also hardly noticed any crinkly noises at all. This was also the first time I had used my new Ursack food bag. I tied this to a tree very close to my tent (knowing the bears would still be hibernating). The Ursack seemed to work fine, but I really question if this could hold five days worth of food. I know I had extra food, partially because I was prepared for an emergency if I had been stranded out in the woods for an extra night. Perhaps I need to get a bigger OpSack but I would be hard-pressed to carry five days of food in this bag. I will have to reconsider whether I simply go back to hanging a bag bag every night. I also need to remember that hiker hunger does not kick in immediately for me. This was also the first time I used my new Z-Packs Arc-Blast backpack. I was a bit disappointed in this. While it is certainly light, the suspension (the ""Arc"" part) tended to bend in funny ways while I was packing up the pack. I could also not reach my water bottles without taking the pack off (which I could do with my ULA Ohm). One of the zipper pulls on my belt pockets also came undone during this trip. The material also seemed somewhat flimsy (particulary some extremely thin straps. I will probably try this out one more time, but I am considering not using this pack on the Appalachian Trail. With all three of these changes I can see that while I am very concerned about weight, I want to ensure that my gear works and is reasonably comfortable. If people could do the trail in the past with heavy gear, I should be able to do this as well. I also tried out my new Anker PowerCore 20100 battery recharger. This seemed to work well. I recharged my phone and the charge level hardly dropped. I also tried out a new Columbia long=sleeved Silver Ridge Omni Shade hiking shirt. This was very comfortable and yet seemed warm enough. I plan on hiking in long sleeves and long pants, partially because I tend to do this locally as it is an effective way to minimize distress from biting insects. By doing the majority of my hike southbound, I will be running into hordes of black flies and mosquitoes in Maine. While I feel I should be reasonably prepared for this (as northern Wisconsin also gets hordes of mosquitoes and deer flies), I still need to see if a shirt like this works well in warm weather (and is thick enough to prevent bug bites). I continue to like the CraftSport thermal hiking gloves. These seemed to work well. They were comfortable and I really had no problems with blisters from my hiking poles. My hands got very cold while scooping up water for filtration, but otherwise tended to stay warm. These also seemed more functional than the Possum Down gloves from Z-packs. I also realized I have to work on my filtration system. I had hoped to create a gravity filtration system using the Sawyer Squeeze water filtration. I think I need to drill a hole into the tornado tube to help with venting air as the bottle fills. I think I also need to find a smaller Smartwater bottle as even the 700ml size seemed too big to fit in the shoulder strap pouch on my backpack. However, I tend to drink a lot of water and 500mls doesn't seem much. Particularly when hiking at Philmont, I would routinely chug a liter of water before heading out. I did sleep with my Sawyer Squeeze (to prevent it from freezing) and found it didn't disturb my sleep at all. Even though I am not much of a drinker, I had hoped to try a portable flask on this trip. However, because I had given up alcohol for Lent, I will have to wait for another trip before trying this luxury. Meanwhile this section of the trail was fairly boring. I was really surprised how much I had done yesterday. The last several miles were largely on a snowmobile trail which paralleled a road, but this was only a small part of this section of trail. I now only have ~163 miles to complete the entire 310 mile Superior Hiking Trail.

the University of Wisconsin in Madison but because of bad weather and 
other important events (we celebrated my son's Eagle Scout Court of

the smaller shrubs are just starting to develop leaves. A moderate amount of ducks were out and a few marshes had lots of spring peepers. There were
also no mosquitoes to deal with yet (although ticks are out). I climbed
the equivalent of 96 floors.  By the time I got back to my car, the 
weather had clouded over and it had started to rain (and this rain 
persisted until I got to Green Bay). 
While I was at the 
meeting, I found out that the significant other of one of the resident 
board members is on the Appalachian right now. He had started at the end
of February and has already reached Pennsylvania (as she said that he 
is in the ""first 15% of hikers""). This was another serendipitous moment 
which points out how popular long-distance backpacking has become. The 
Board knows that I will likely be missing next year's meeting (although I
may be able to listen in on a phone). I have been trying to shed 
responsibilities for next year's hike. Specifically, my term as Hospital Chief of Staff ends in January and my term on our Church Council ends in 
February. Our hospital's administration is finally starting to get 
worried about how they will keep the clinic and hospital staffed during 
my absence. However, because I have been telling them for the last 9 
years that I might be leaving during the 10th year, I don't feel as much
of a sense of obligation that I used to have.
After my meeting in Green Bay on Saturday I had to return home. On the way back, I hiked the Ringle South segment (just east of Ringle, WI). This section had a lot fewer lakes and navigated around a series of cross-country ski trails. I got lost off of the trail twice as I missed the yellow blazes directing me back off a ski trail. I did another 7 miles on this trail (out and back) with the equivalent of 70 flights of stairs) before I got back into my car and finished the drive home. I didn't see a single person on this entire trek. It was great being out in the woods again. I can definitely feel that I have used muscles which I don't get to use routinely, but my legs were really in quite good shape as I have been hitting the treadmill a lot this winter. I also noted that my toes are getting quite calloused so I don't feel I have to worry about blisters as much. When I did get lost, I had an easy time finding the trail again using the Mammoth Trails app (which is produced by the same people who produce Guthook). By getting more familiar with this app, I will feel more confident navigating my way along the Appalachian. Since my 
last post, I picked up a few more pieces of gear. The largest purchase 
was a Mountain Hardware Ghost Whisperer puffy down jacket. I used a 20% 
off coupon as well as my REI dividend check (made much larger this year 
by making the REI credit card my most commonly used card). As a result, I
got this $350 jacket for free! I also got a sack which can help inflate
my Thermarest Neo-Air ground pad (as well as serve as another dry 
sack). 

I realize that I really don't like to journal on my phone, instead preferring the luxury of a nice full-sized keyboard and monitor. I tend to do a lot of editing of my entries before I post them. As such, maintaining this journal while I am on the trail may be quite difficult. I will have to see if this old dog can learn a few tricks to be able to post from the trail next year. Perhaps someone can point to a post which gives a few pointers for making entries on a phone.",,View Entry,"May 06, Sat",14
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563975,"I had a free afternoon after being on call overnight in the ER. I drove up to Duluth and continued my efforts to hike the entire 310 mile Superior Hiking Trail before the end of this year. The weather was beautiful (although it was a bit cooler near the lakeshore) with temperatures between the low 50's and the mid 60's. Perfect hiking weather! 

I started out at the Fox Farm Road Trailhead. I had reached this location last October on the last day of my 5 day backpacking trek. I then finished out the section to the Sucker River trailhead turnoff (which I had started at during my backpacking trip last month). The 10 mile trek (there and back) was very nice. I considered it quite scenic with a few nice views. Some people feel this section isn't particularly nice because a lot of the area has been cut over, but there were two billboards explaining that the DNR was intentionally doing this to ensure pioneer forest communities in this area did not die off. I thought the area was still quite scenic as the logging had been done several years ago so the area was already regrowing nicely. The cutting had also produced some nice views. Except for seeing one barn way in the distance at an overlook, I didn't see any other structures and there were no road walks. The trail was well-marked and reasonably well maintained. The only people I met on this section of the trail were two hikers who were attempting a thru-hike of the entire trail. It was nice to also fill in a gap in the trail as I have now hiked the entire 41 mile section between Martin Road and the Lake County Demonstration Forest Trailhead (and I am now hiked just over half of the entire trail). 

Because I had left early enough in the day, I still had some time before dark so I went into Duluth and did another section of the trail, hiking between the Twin Ponds trailhead and the Duluth Lift Bridge. While this was an urban trail, it was lightly traveled. The trail went down a wooded steep hill, crossed Interstate 35 on an overhead bridge, and then paralleled the lake. I had to make one detour because of construction on a bridge. I wanted to get this section done now because it can be nearly impossible to park in Duluth during the summer months. I still have the western side of Canal Park to finish up on another day. The walk back up the steep hill was challenging at the end of a long day but wasn't as hard as I had expected. This extended hill climb is my idea of perfect training for the Appalachian. 

Overall, my FitBit says I walked 30,000 steps and climbed the equivalent of 200 flights of stairs today. I really didn't experiment with any gear as I only had a daypack with me (intentionally loaded down with 5 liters of water and some extra gear to let my shoulders get a bit of stress). I did realize that I definitely prefer the Koss brand of sport headphones as these stay in my ears better than other varieties I had tested. I realize this post is already a bit long so I will abridge this entry and leave my other thoughts for another upcoming post.",,Sucker River Trailhead,"May 09, Tue",16
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564134,"During the last post I mentioned that I I have been using headphones. I have been using headphones while hiking since last fall, primarily listening to downloaded podcasts (starting with This American Life), Great Courses lectures, music, or Audible books. During last fall’s 5 day hike I realized I could listen to recordings for extended amounts of time without significantly depleting my cell phone battery. I also found I didn’t notice as many aches and pains associated with hiking when my mind is engaged with a good book.  Primarily for these reasons, I decided to get a subscription to Audible. Over the winter I really didn’t use it much, gradually building up a library for my Appalachian Trail hike. With a subscription, you receive one credit every month for $14.95/month (although everyone is eligible for a free trial book). I had started my subscription hoping to build up a library before the trail, but since I became a member I realize that you can always buy additional books and they seem to routinely have specials where some books are half-price (particularly first books of series). As a result, over the winter, my library has grown appreciably over the winter. I also have a large wish list. I thought I could enjoy it now that backpacking season is upon us. At this point, I am thinking that I will probably start hiking for the first hour of the day without headphones to take in and listen to all the morning birds. After that I would probably be listening to something unless I am engaged in a conversation with another hiker. 

I know that some people think that $14.95/month is a lot of money. However, as long as I take advantage of this, I feel it has value. I live in a small town and don’t really have access to audio books. I have purchased a number of them (as I like to listen to material while driving) and I know that CD recordings are very expensive (most books are over $40). I feel my driving is safer as I tend to be more alert when I am engrossed in a book. However, I have missed exits while driving on the Interstate multiple times. The hardest part of listening to Audible while hiking is finding an efficient way to stop the playback when I want to talk to someone. I’ll have to figure something out as I know there will be far more people on the Appalachian Trail than on the Superior Hiking Trail. 

This past weekend I had finished up the book ""I Hike"" by Lawton Grinter and had enjoyed this book of stories about thru-hiking. The tome was not organized as a travelogue of a single hike but rather each chapter revolved around a single concept with the best stories from his Triple Crown hikes interspersed to illustrate the concept. After this book, I decided to broaden my literary range and chose a non-hiking related book. 

On this hike, I started the novel ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" by Jean Auel. I believe I purchased this for only $5 during a “4 books for $20” special from a select list of books contained in a promotional e-mail. I know there was a somewhat cheesy movie of the same title several years ago, but I had recently listened to a Great Courses  http://www.thegreatcourses.com...  class on ""The Rise of Humans"" which referenced this book several times so the book did appear to have more scientific value. In this historical fiction, a young human's parents were destroyed during an earthquake. The book tells of her experiences after she is eventually adopted into a Neanderthal tribe. Knowing the scientific backing behind the book, I have already noticed how the author has been interpolating scientific facts into the narrative (e.g. explaining how Neanderthals couldn’t throw with a sling overhand because of their skeletal structure). So far this book has been very engaging (and may have allowed me to make yesterday’s long hike with relative ease). 

 

I had also recently had my DNA analyzed using 23 and Me and found out I have 232 Neanderthal gene variants (which is less than 64% of Europeans and more importantly (lol) six fewer  than my wife!). After listening to the first part of this book, I had a revelation wondering whether my current goal to hike the Appalachian Trail comes to me on a primal or almost instinctual level. Perhaps my Neanderthal genes are becoming active???  Certainly thru-hikers appear to look a lot more like cavemen! lol   

Do you listen to anything while you are hiking. Does your goal to hike come to you on an instinctual level also?  Is it YOUR inner Neanderthal coming out?",,View Entry,"May 11, Thu",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564658,"I had to make a quick business trip out to Salt Lake City for a training (to be able to prescribe and insert plastic rods impregnated with a chemical to help patients addicted to narcotics). After last Tuesday's long day hike, I hardly was able to do any walking at all for several days (consecutive days of 4000 or fewer steps) as I was busy and had to be able to get out of town quickly. I was able to get my work responsibilities finished and then drove to Minneapolis for a Park and Fly option at an airport hotel. My flight left at 7 am on Friday. I had to arrive early but then went through security quickly. Because I still had a lot of time to spend, I walked approximately 4 miles around the airport into all seven terminals. The flight was on time so I arrived with plenty of free time until the training in the afternoon. I saw the mountains all around me and decided to try to do a bit of hiking in the foothills. After wandering around for a bit trying to find a trailhead, I found a nice trail and I headed out (not really dressed for the part as I even used my work shoes). I was able to find my first Utah geocache (as my only prior trip to Utah, back in 1992) was prior to my time as a geocacher (as the hobby didn't even exist back then). I continued to climb and put in a nice workout finding a few more geocaches on that trail before heading back downtown. The foothills were lush on a nice warm (low 80's) spring day with many plants blooming. On some of the steep climbs (and then descents) I really missed my trekking poles (as I didn't think I would be able to bring those as carry-on items). I was able to get views of Great Salt Lake. But when I looked at the really high mountains, I thought I really needed to try to climb some more. The training went quickly that afternoon. I still had several hours before dusk so I headed up into Big Cottonwood Canyon and went up the canyon. I turned around when I saw the snow getting quite deep and then descended until I found a snowless area. I then headed out on the trail. Because the road is at the bottom of the canyon, the trail went consistently up. Before long I started to encounter snow (the snow level was around 8000 feet). Because of the heat, it really wasn't cold (and I had changed into better hiking clothes and boots). Fortunately the snow had good traction so I kept going and eventually made it to Dog Lake (which was still completely frozen). On my way back I encountered a porcupine and was able to snap a photo of it before it scrambled into the woods.This really piqued my interest for doing further hiking in the mountains. Consistently climbing up provided great training for the long climbs that I will expect to find next year. Overall, I walked more than 30,000 steps (my second 30k step day this week!) and climbed the equivalent of 287 flights of stairs. I still had one more day in Utah before having the head back home. As long as I knew I would be able to get rest next week, I planned to do even more the next day.",,View Entry,"May 12, Fri",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564669,"The next day I initially intended to head out before dawn. Using the card in the room, I had ordered room service to be delivered at 6am (and then found out at 6:30 that breakfast wasn’t able to be served until 7am on weekends so I cancelled this and headed out. Instead I got a quick meal and a large coffee at McDonalds (after stocking up with food and drinks yesterday). My initial plan was to drive into Little Cottonwood Canyon and hike a particular trail which a former medical student of mine who matched at the University of Utah had recommended when I told her about my trip. This trail was above snow line but I decided to try it anyway based on yesterday’s relatively easy climb. Unfortunately, the day was much cooler than yesterday and the snow was quite icy. After only ½ mile I turned around. If I had microspikes and hiking poles, I might have tried it further, but again I didn’t think that the TSA would approve of these items in my carry-on luggage. I then descended to the mouth of the canyon and decided to try to hike Bell Canyon (as I knew there was a long trail with a large number of geocaches on it) but found the trailhead parking lot was completely full. I headed back to Big Cottonwood Canyon and ended up at the trailhead immediately to the south of where I had hiked yesterday. 

After finding a geocache quickly, I found the trail forked. One side gave me the option to hike to the same Dog Lake that I had been at yesterday so I decided to try that one. I walked along until again I was going above snowline. This trail was not well-travelled at all and I eventually had to turned around when I was uncertain where the trail even went (walking over drifts that were at least 4-5 feet deep and often postholing). At one point I saw a three foot drift above a bridge on the trail. The rushing stream had exposed the bridge. Because of the way the drift melted, I could not directly walk on the bridge. If the drift collapsed above the bridge, I would likely fall into the stream as it was clearly uphill of the bridge. I wasn’t about to try fording the stream swelled with melt water on a cool day. 

On the way back, I stopped and was eating a snack when two people came from the trail behind me. I asked if they came down the trail and they explained that they had gone along a different trail and then bushwhacked down to this trail. I followed them back down to the fork but when they headed out, I decided to head in for more hiking as I figured I could at least follow their tracks. 

This trail also quickly became snow-covered but because it was initially not as shaded, the going was easier on this side of the canyon. However, after a brief time, the serious uphill part of this trip started. At one point near the top of the ridge, I was hiking upwards at about a 70 degree angle and was having the use my hands. I would have to kick my boots into snow and then fall back half the distance as the snow compacted. This was extremely slow going. I had been using the Endomondo app. While most of the prior day I was able to hike a mile in 17-25 minutes, two of these miles took nearly two hours. Some of this was obviously the grade, and I think that the altitude clearly played a role as well as I had to stop frequently to catch my breath (as I not had an opportunity to acclimate to this elevation (~9000 feet)). After a long climb, I finally gained the peak of a ridge which surrounded the canyon. While on top of this ridge, I found a moose print (which the two hikers had said they had discovered and then scared off).  I eventually found where the prior hikers had turned around and started downhill along an open-faced snowy cliff face. This initially looked quite daunting as I was afraid I would plummet and possibly become injured. However, by this point it was above freezing. I was able to descend by kicking my foot lower and inwards. I would settle further down with snow compaction but I was able to control my rate of descent. It turned out to be quite fun. I also knew exactly where I was headed because the Endomondo app was still running and showed me where I had already been earlier that day. 

After this adventure was completed, I still had some energy left so I descended the canyon a bit and arrived at the Temple Quarry Trailhead. From here, I walked along a bike trail for several miles up (and then back down) the mountain. This was another great workout but at a lower grade and without snow.  By the time I got back to the hotel I was beat. After eating supper, I quickly went to bed (partially due to having another early morning wakeup call to be home in time to celebrate Mother’s Day with my wife). 

For the day, I hiked over 32,000 steps and climbed the equivalent of 402 flights of stairs. Another long day!  While I was a little sore, it was less than I had expected. If I can maintain even a semblance of this degree of physical fitness, I should be able to complete the Appalachian. Unfortunately, I won’t be in any mountains for a while. And while I was able to get away for three consecutive weekends, I now won’t be able to have any days off until the last Monday in June when I will be singing in a concert in Chicago.  http://www.mcp.us/upcoming-events/2017/6/26/clausen-works",,View Entry,"May 13, Sat",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565824,"Yesterday, after taking overnight ER call, I made the two hour drive to Duluth to do some more hiking. I initially wanted to finish the Lakewalk portion of the Superior Hiking Trail in downtown Duluth. This area gets exceedingly busy during the summer so I wanted to finish it up before Memorial Day. I seemed more tired than usual on my way up to Duluth and found myself eating moderate quantities of trail mix to help me stay awake. This snacking (and listening to the new Beatles channel on Sirius radio) did help keep me alert for the drive. I found the Rose Garden parking lot and started hiking east. The route was on a paved trail or boardwalk the entire way to the Lift Bridge where I had stopped several weeks ago. There were a lot more things to look at but I was mostly only there for the hiking. My first mile took less than 14 minutes. Overall the trail was well marked, but on the way back I continued on the Lakewalk east of the Rose Garden (until it finished) and found out the Superior HIking Trail had turned off. I walked back and then started doing some road walking until I was stopped at the top of 14th avenue by construction which blocked access to the next section of trail. At this point, I still had a moderate amount of daylight so I headed west back to the Twin Ponds trailhead and headed west from there. Initially I only wanted to do a 1.6 mile section to the next trailhead. However by the time I covered this distance I decided to continue on the trail. I eventually ended up at Haines Road which is where I had ended during my first trip this spring. These two sections close up a large gap of the trail as I have now completed an approximately 40 mile section from Jay Cooke state park to the eastern side of Duluth. I have a few miles of trail on either side of this stretch to finish up the entire Duluth section of the Superior Hiking Trail. Overall I hiked quite a bit. I was a bit disappointed to find out that I developed some blisters at the base of both toes, (although these appear to be quite minor). FitBit reports that I walked over 32,000 steps covering over 18 miles (which includes my time in the hospital (I didn't leave until noon). It also states that I climbed the equivalent of 236 floors. According to Endomondo (which I only used on the SHT), I covered 6.36 miles during the first segment (but only climbed 499 feet as this section was quite flat near the lake) and then trekked 9.28 miles on the second section with a total ascent of 4098 feet. I was quite tired on the drive back home. I didn't try out any new gear. Now that the urban sections of the Superior Hiking Trail are finished, I will be carrying my fully loaded backpack as I finish up the rest of the trail (even though camping is not allowed in the Duluth section of the SHT. I continued to listen to the Clan of the Cave Bear as I still haven't finished it (even after a two full days on the Superior Hiking Trail and ~12 hrs hiking in Utah). These books definitely make the hiking easier and I now realize I can be a bit more liberal listening to this. Audible just had another sale during which I was able to take two books off my wish list for the price of only one credit. I should have a significant library when I embark on the Appalachian.",,View Entry,"May 24, Wed",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567034,"I had to work every day during the Memorial Day weekend covering all
the hospital inpatients and serving as a backup provider for several 
nurse practitioners who covered the emergency room during the busy 
holiday weekend. As a result I couldn't do anything outside except some 
chores around my home. However, I did decide to take a hike on Tuesday. 
I
got a reasonably early start so I decided to fill in a 10 mile hole in 
the Superior Hiking Trail. During last fall's long hike I had hiked 
between Fox Farm Road and Lake County Demonstration Forest. This next 
section was a long section with 10 miles between the Demonstration Forest and Reeves Road (20 miles back and forth).
I decided to push myself and do this section today rather than 
finishing up shorter sections around Duluth. I made the longer drive to 
Two Harbors, MN and headed north to the parking lot. After the long 
drive, I only had 8 1/2 hrs of daylight to do 20 miles (as I had to hike
there and back). The weekend had had off and on showers and it was 
raining on the north shore when I headed out but fortunately, the line 
of showers had recently pushed through shortly before I started hiking. 
Except for some light drizzle, heavy rain held off. It was a bit nippy 
with highs only in the low 50's but I quickly got rid of my fleece and 
hiked in only a synthetic t-shirt. Due to the recent rain, much of the 
trail was quite muddy and my speed dropped as a result. However, after 
stepping in a few puddles I found it simply quicker to walk right 
through most of the smaller puddles. While most of the trail was well marked, I did make a wrong turn one time on the way back and probably walked an extra 1/2 mile by the time I figured out my mistake and had walked back to where I went wrong. 
The section was relatively flat and I made the trip to the next parking area quite quickly. The way back was slower as I had to stop several times to rest.
I had chugged a liter of fluids when I left my car and only drank two 
additional liters but never showed signs of dehydration as the low 
temperatures really stopped my fluid losses through sweating. Although there were no significant panoramic views, the trail was still fairly picturesque as there was far more green this week than last week up here. There was also some logging being done through the area. A moose had walked a long section of the trail as there were many tracks but I did not see it. The trail also crossed the Stewart River which was quite loud as it was swollen from spring snowmelt and the weekend's rains. There was a very scenic campsite by it which I might consider coming back to. Falling to sleep by a babbling brook or river is always nice. 
During this hike, I finally finished up listening to ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"". Overall I have to say that I definitely enjoyed listening to this book. One problem with Audiobooks is that they take longer to read than print books as I was definitely ready to start a new book. I started a new fantasy series called the Stoneheart Trilogy. I haven't really heard much about this series but I always enjoy this genre. The biggest reason I decided to try it is because I loved Jim Dale's performance of the Harry Potter audiobooks and he also did the narration for this series. Hearing his voice again made it almost seem like Harry Potter was coming alive again. So far I have enjoyed the book but wouldn't put it at the same level yet.  When I embarked I saw that I still had some cell phone signal so I did not put my phone into airplane mode. Surprisingly my phone's battery ran out and I walked the last mile or two in silence. I had my portable battery recharger with me but I wasn't going to stop for the time necessary to recharge. As I tackle areas that are farther away from Duluth, I will need to remember to put my phone into airplane mode to prevent my phone from running out of juice quickly.  

For
the day, I hit 45,000 steps for only the third time since I purchased 
my FitBit 5 years ago. I also climbed the equivalent of 228 flights of 
stairs. Last week's blister proved to be nothing as it was mainly only an area of callous that sloughed off with firm skin already underneath it. I did develop a small blister on the opposite foot along my bunion (which probably didn't appreciate all the side to side puddle jumping necessary due to the muddy trail. While the rest of me is sore today, this blister hasn't bothered me at all. Hopefully my foot will be able to tolerate a hike this weekend. 
It has been fun watching ""Follow Bigfoot"" hike on the Superior Hiking Trail on YouTube this past weekend. He made videos along 
the exact same section that I had hiked last fall. I could tell that he 
even missed the first mile of the trail (as he needed to go in the 
opposite direction to find the northern terminus). It would be nice to 
actually meet him in person some time. I have even become a Patreon 
backer for him and might reach out to him for a gear shakedown prior to actually leaving on the AT. He is hoping to make an attempt for the fastest known time on the Superior Hiking Trail. To do this he will need to walk 15 hours a day averaging 2.7 miles per hour (40 miles daily) and then walking through the night during the last 36 hrs. I thought I had been a fast hiker. However, yesterday's hike only averaged 2.67 miles per hour and was only for 7.5 hours. I don't think I would be able to keep up with him for long distances. 

It has been disappointing to see several people whom I have been 
following go off the Appalachian Trail for various reasons. I hope this 
isn't me next year. I am hoping to find a southbounder starting soon as 
most of my trip will be southbound and I simply don't have the time to 
start from Georgia with so many vloggers out there now. I had been watching Early Riser but couldn't spare the time for multiple 40 minute videos. When I do watch a video, I have been making notes in my 2013 copy of AWOL's guide (which is around the time I decided to do this thru-hike) which I will transpose into the 2018 guide when I can order it. I've also start posting some of my hikes in the Hike a Day in May Facebook group which was started by the owner of Woodchuck's Hostel in Damascus. 
I repeatedly find myself now saying I won't be here next year for periodic yearly events. While many of my patients are encouraging, some of my patients are even a bit upset about the prospect of my absence. I will be leaving for the trail in exactly 300 days. According to my countdown app, I also just went to one digit in months as I now leave in 9.9 months. If I could, I would leave immediately. However considering I've been posting in TrailJournals for nearly 300 days already, I know that next March will be here reasonably soon.",,View Entry,"Jun 01, Thu",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567428,"I only had one free weekend for backpacking this month (and I believe I won't have any next month) so I decided to get in a quick 
backpacking trip. I decided to hike between Castle Danger and Beaver 
Bay. This will fill in most of a large gap in the trail that I haven't 
finished with a 4.7 mile gap between Beaver Bay and Silver Bay and fewer
than 10 miles between Castle Danger and Reeves Road. I scheduled a 
shuttle to pick me up on Saturday morning. I was to be picked up at 7:45
am so I decided to make most of the drive up to Duluth on Friday night 
and stayed at a hotel overnight so I could get an early start on 
Saturday. 
I arrived with plenty of time for the shuttle pickup. 
Two other people were also in my shuttle - both of whom were successful 
Appalachian thru-hikers from 2013. She lived in southern Wisconsin and 
he was from St. Paul, MN. On the way up we talked a lot about the AT (as
she had an AT patch on her backpack which started the conversation). 
While they both never once regretted doing the hike, they both bemoaned 
the fact that there are many young hikers who feel entitled to trail 
magic and other services which has been infuriating some hostel owners. 
They both were very supportive of my attempt. 
After I got dropped
off, I started the long hike. I estimated I had to hike about 27 miles 
over two days to get back to my car. This section of the trail was much 
more scenic than the areas which I had been hiking so far this year. 
There were both spectacular waterfalls but also far more hills with some
beautiful overlooks. The day started out with temperatures in the 40's 
and gradually warmed up. I quickly abandoned my outer shirt. Originally 
rain had been forecasted for the day. I checked the radar on the way up.
A line of thunderstorms had just gone through the area but the rain 
ended after this round of storms came through. A few mosquitoes were starting to emerge and I saw a few ticks but overall, the bugs rmained quite minimal during the entire hike. 
I
quickly made a mistake when I missed a turnoff to remain on the trail. I
continued straight onto a spur trail (which was part of a loop which 
went to a resort, the Cove Point Inn. By the time I figured out my 
error, I had to finish off the loop. This added ~3 miles to my day. 
There were several detours to be negotiated during the course of the 
day. The first involved a loop around the Split Rock State Park. 
However, with the bridge permanently out and the river not thought to be
safely passable, I was easily able to bypass this entire loop, The 
second detour involved walking along a snowmobile/bike path into 
Gooseberry Falls State Park. I knew that the main trail continued along 
the western side of the river. I never saw any Superior Hiking Trail 
signs along the entire bike trail. While the directions talked about the
visitor center (which was on the western side of the river, the actual 
trail was on the right side of the river. I did another 2 miles of extra
walking before I finally located the actual trail (more maps along the 
bicycle trail would have been helpful as well). 
With these two 
extensions, I was worried about finishing before dark. There was a long 
section without campsites. I had to walk entirely through Gooseberry 
Falls State Park before I ran into a campsite. I was having to stop 
frequently to rest and decided to stay at the first available campsite 
(which was described as a large group campsite. Fortunately, I was the 
only person who chose this campsite so I had it entirely to myself. I 
was nearly too tired to even set up my tent or to cook. I barely had 
enough daylight left to do my camp chores. I ended up really enjoying 
the hot meal (and am pretty sure I will not be going stoveless next year
on the AT). I really appreciated the quick setup of my Ursack rather 
than having to find a tree to hang a bear bag. While I didn't sleep particularly well (I woke up every time I rolled over as I was quite sore and my quilt would often roll off of me when I moved as well), I really didn't worry about my food at all that night.  
I
did experiment with some new gear. It was a bit nippy around camp and I
wanted to try my new Mountain Hardware Ghost Whisperer jacket. This 
worked nicely to remove the chill as I cooked my dinner. I have now 
moved this jacket to my separate stash of gear ready for the Appalachian
Trail. I also tried the Thermarest NeoAir Pump Sack. This made it much 
easier to fill up the NeoAir Ground Pad butI wasn't really sure I was 
doing it correctly as It took nearly 6 full times to get the pad 
inflated. This was still easier than blowing it up (and will keep 
moisture from my breath out of the pad). I like the Neoair pad as well 
so both of these items will go into the Appalachian gear pile (and I can
use older gear on camping trips until then. I also had some lightweight
camp shoes which could also work for water crossings. These seemed to 
work okay around camp. However, there would be no way that I would be 
able to hike in these so I will probably keep my Crocs instead. I used 
my Z-Packs Arc Blast backpack again. This seemed to function reasonably 
well today. My hips were the most sore when I got into the camp due to 
the pressure from the pack. I need to use my ULA Ohm 2.0 again and will 
decide between these two packs (or perhaps start with one for Virginia 
and then swap that out). I also tried out a commercially made Cozy 
to keep my dinner warm while it rehydrated. This worked great. My home 
made cozy is falling apart already so this will go into the gear for the
AT (and I will retire my homemade cozy). 
According to my FitBit, I easily beat my personal best of 47000 steps by walking 55,357 steps and climbing the equivalent of 474 floors (my second highest day in this category). This was truly a record day for me. I feel that my off-season conditioning (and Tuesday day hikes) have gotten me into trail shape faster than I did last year before I went to Philmont. I became a bit worried last week when FollowBigfoot commented at how flat the Superior Hiking Trail was as I didn't consider it flat. I had been using this trail specifically because there were hills on it. I will simply have to do the best I can and then let the trail work me into shape next year. Hopefully my plan to start in Virginia before hiking southbound will work to harden me up before the difficult sections.",,View Entry,"Jun 03, Sat",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567624,"It was hard to get up in the morning. I had slept fitfully. It 
started getting light around 5 am but I waited until my alarm went off 
at 6 to get going. I lazed about preparing for the day. I had to filter 
some water, eat and pack up. It was nearly 8 before I hit the trail. I 
can usually pack up much more quickly but I was still a bit overwhelmed 
by yesterday. However, once I got on the trail again (with the help of 
two Aleve) I limbered up fairly quickly so I knew I wouldn't really have
too much difficulty getting back to my car. 
I passed several 
other campsites (the ones which I had originally been shooting for) and 
saw a few day hikers packing up. One person was even stealth hiking 
along a grassy drive which bisected the trail. The day was beautiful and
I started out reasonably quickly but my endurance did start to fade, particularly during the uphills. I eventually made it back to my car.
At
this point it was still reasonably early. I had volunteered to do some 
scouting for Bigfoot who will be attempting to trek the SHT in the 
Fastest Known Time next month. There was a long detour around the 
Embarrass River as the bridge was out. He wanted to know if the river 
was still fordable. I thought I still had enough energy to dayhike the 
~3 miles to the river and back. I set out and made the trip reasonably 
quickly. I met a volunteer who was doing some trail maintenance and he 
told me that someone had recently erected some large flat stones which 
could be used as a bridge over the river. When I did get to the river, 
it was easy to cross while staying completely dry. It was really not a 
particularly large river so it was probably still fordable even during 
the spring melt. 
On the way back, I found a beautiful overlook 
and took a break and then found myself awakened by the sounds of thunder
in the distance. While it was still sunny over me, I could see a storm 
to my north. I headed out and walked quickly. I did hit the edge of the 
storm and got rained on, but fortunately the lightening stayed away from
my area. I was starting to flag again (even with the rest) but nothing 
really hurt too badly (even the ankle that I had slightly sprained the day before). For the day, I walked 12 miles and 26,000 steps and climbed the equivalent of 172 flights of stairs. 
I
was happy that the blisters which I had gotten during the previous two 
long Tuesday dayhikes didn't really bother me either. They had burst but
the overlying skin was still thick enough that it helped to protect the
area. I did use Leukotape over these areas and I think this worked 
beautifully. I continue to hike in Injinji socks but have found that I 
really can't wear toe socks if I have taped my toes. When I start on the
trail next year, I am thinking about upgrading to the Farm 2 Feet 
Damascus socks and using Leukotape until I get solid callouses. The 
Injinji socks kept falling down into my hiking boot. They do a good job 
of protecting my toes from blisters (and help mechanically to prevent my
bunions from acting up, but I may use different toe spacers to 
accomplish this same goal. 
While I didn't see much wildlife 
(except for a solitary deer), when I got home, I found bear scat in my 
back yard and the bear hit our garbage yesterday while the bin was 
curbside waiting to be picked up. I've been somewhat amazed by the lack 
of wildlife sightings on the SHT. 
After this hike, I have only a bit more than 100 miles left to go to finish the Superior Hiking Trail before the end of this year. I've already requested time off to be able to hike the remaining large northern section in early October so my goal should be able to be accomplished with only a few additional dayhikes to finish different sections. Next goal - start the AT!",,View Entry,"Jun 06, Tue",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568192,"When I made my last post, I didn’t think I would be able to get up on the Superior Hiking Trail on a weekend until possibly August. However, while I was responsible for rounding on all our hospital’s inpatients this weekend, another physician was covering the ER so I was free after I finished my rounds. When I was done, I headed up to Duluth to do another section of the Superior Hiking Trail. My wife was out of town driving to southern Wisconsin to drop off my son at the statewide camp “Badgers Boys State” which he had to be nominated to attend. It was an honor for him to get to go to this as the Governor of Wisconsin traditionally comes and speaks to the boys at this camp every year. 

 

Because I was still a bit delayed getting to the trail, I stayed in a southern section. I decided to complete a 9.1 mile section starting from Jay Cooke State Park to the southern terminus of the trail. This section of the trail was only finally completed last year (although the official opening of the last section will be celebrated later this year).  Because I had heard about a river crossing without a bridge, I had been avoiding this section until the trees had leafed out and the woods had started to dry out a bit. This past week temperatures finally got into the 80’s and there was little rain so it seemed like a good time to attempt this section. 

 

This new trail quickly passed over the St. Louis River on a swinging bridge (quite secure with metal cables) and followed the river for a while but then turned south while the river drained north into Lake Superior. The trails initially were quite wide and only when the trail started heading out of the park did it become narrower. The weeds had really shot up over the past week and the mosquito hatch had finally occurred (although a brisk southern wind kept them manageable so I didn’t even have to apply repellant). While this section of the trail was quite hilly, going up and down medium sized hills frequently, it was well marked (with only one intersection which wasn’t obvious where to go. I found that I wore out much more quickly than usual. I started to worry if I was getting sick until I realized that I simply wasn’t used to hiking in the heat. Heat doesn’t usually bother me when I am acclimated to it so I really am not worried about this on the Appalachian. The final “river” crossing was easily accomplished by rock hopping and I was able to keep my feet completely dry. Once the trail had left the state park, I didn’t see another hiker the entire day. I did scare one deer and had to step over 3 piles of bear scat. I had to stop several times on the way back to rest and rehydrate but these breaks allowed me to keep up my pace when I was hiking. The only new gear I tested out were two water bottles with built in filters. I didn’t really like either one of these primarily because I couldn’t gulp down water all at once (as I typically quaff a liter at a time when I stop to rest). 

 

The trail ended at the Minnesota/Wisconsin border. A new part of the North Country Trail started the section in Wisconsin. I started this section but then turned back as I was starting to get a bit worried about time (and my endurance). The last section of this trail paralleled some train tracks. At one point a long loud train passed by unseen through the dense woods. Fortunately it wasn’t loud enough to prevent me from hearing my audiobook “IronHeart” which is the second book in the StoneHeart Trilogy. I also had finished up an  old Michael Crichton novel “Sphere” which was some of his early work before he became famous with his Jurassic Park novel. I had thought I had finished all of his novels but Audible discovered a few I had not. Both of these books were enjoyable. For the day I hiked 36,000 steps and climbed the equivalent of 321 floors. This was a light day compared with last Saturday but still a decent workout.

 

The North Country Trail Association is doing another challenge this year. You can earn a patch by hiking 100 miles anywhere on the NCT. I earned this last year (but not until October). This year I became a dues paying member of the North Country Trail Association (as well as the Superior Hiking Trail Association, the Ice Age Trail Alliance and the Appalachian Trail Conservancy) and have already hiked enough miles on the Superior Hiking Trail to qualify for the patch (as out and back hikes count for miles hiked not miles of trail). This was the first Wisconsin section of the North Country Trail that I had hiked. On the way back, I realized this was also the first state crossing I had made while hiking. Hopefully next year I will have many more!",,View Entry,"Jun 10, Sat",18
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570305,"This past weekend I joined a group of friends from the Grantsburg Chorale and rode a bus down to Chicago. We’d been planning this trip for months. We were able to join with a group chorus through Manhattan Concert Productions to sing choral works by Dr. Rene’ Clausen and this same acclaimed composer was going to be directing our group. To learn the music we had been going to weekly practices since late January. We even had to submit an audition tape before we were finally confirmed to be able to sing. 
We had done a similar trip back in 2012. During that trip, we sang in Carnegie Hall. I was still a relative choral novice as I had never even sung harmony until around 2010 when I was drafted into our church choir after a significant portion of our church left because of a controversy involving homosexual ministers. However, because I was already able to read music (having played piano and clarinet back during elementary and high school), and because tenors tend to be in short supply, I started to sing initially with the church choir and then also with the Grantsburg chorale. Over the years I have become a serviceable tenor. I find I enjoy singing but still struggle at times to find my initial note. While I usually sing tenor 1, for this group, I dropped down to tenor 2 as the composer expected tenor 1’s to sing as high as a B (even though I am one of the few tenors in our local group who can even get to a G). This group also had learning tracks which made it far easier to learn the music in which I could hear the tenor 2 part highlighted. 
We drove down early Saturday and then had a three hour practice on Saturday night. We then had a 4 hour practice on Sunday and our final rehearsals on Monday inside the church before the concert on Monday evening. We had some free time to explore Chicago including having our entire group take a cruise on the Chicago River being educated about some of the architecture. The weather was perfect for this and we had a great time. I even brought along my tuxedo for the final concert. The picture above shows me with my wife and daughter. While my son also sings, he was working at his job as a Counselor at a Boy Scout Camp.  

Monday also happened to be my birthday. My biggest thought about this occasion was mostly how I would be celebrating next year. I will probably be in southern Maine when I hit the 55 year old milestone. I’m not sure if I will want to tell anyone. If I am in a town, I may be buying drinks for my trail family (or “tramily”).  I doubt I will even do much singing on the AT as I don’t have a large repertoire of songs to sing without music. I will probably have a playlist of songs to listen to through headphones and I might sing quietly to these but I really don’t like it when I hear others blasting music so I would try to respect other people by not doing more than simply singing/humming along with my music quietly. While most of this post had nothing to do with the AT, thanks for reading this far!",,4th Presbyterian Church in Chicago,"Jun 26, Mon",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570451,"While I was in Chicago, I did not let my training stop. When I got into the city the first night, I went exploring after our first rehearsal let out around 10 pm.  Even though I have lived in a rural area for the past 26 years, I originally grew up in New York so I wasn’t too worried about wandering around after dark (and having our hotel  nearly on the Magnificent Mile on a Saturday night meant that a lot of people were still out and about). I headed towards the lake and quickly found an access point to the Lake Walk. The park closed at 11 so I was able walk around 2 miles before it closed. 
The next morning, I was out an about by 6:30 and walked several miles to the south (turning around at the juncture with Navy Pier). Later that day our group walked to the Chicago River and took the tour but I learned about the River Walk was well. That evening several of us walked back down to Navy Pier to see some sites and burn up some calories after a great meal at Ditka’s. I walked about 21,000 steps that day. 
The next day, I was on the go by 6 am. I initially walked down Michigan Avenue until I hit the Chicago River, then I walked along the River Walk until I hit Lake Michigan. At this point, I headed south and ended up south of the Shedd Aquarium before I had to turn back. On the way back I walked a slightly different route staying on the Lake Walk all the way.  There were no opportunities for walking the rest of  the day as this was the day of our concert. I walked around 22,000 steps that day (according to Endomondo the total distance was 8.5 miles). 
The last morning, I headed north on the Lake and walked several miles past the Lincoln Park Zoo before turning around. Unfortunately my FitBit died (completely as it didn’t revive after recharging so I had to order a new one) sometime during this walk and I didn’t have it for the rest of this trip (although my Endomondo app estimated my walking distance as 7.4 miles (round trip).  After a lunch with the entire group, we boarded the bus and suffered through the 8 hr ride back home. On the short drive from the high school to my home, we were diverted away from an accident in which an elderly woman whom I know was hit by a farm truck and had to be airlifted to the Twin Cities. 
Overall, both the Lake Walk and the River Walks were great venues. I enjoyed the River Walk slightly better as it was quieter (but part of this was because it was very early on a Sunday morning). There were a lot of bicyclists and other joggers making the trail relatively cluttered. But the views of the skyline and the lake itself made this a great venue to exercise. I found I didn’t really like walking along the city streets as there were far too many stops for traffic lights. There were only a few minor hills but I’m sure that these training hikes kept me in trail-ready hiking shape. Unfortunately, I may not be able to get back to the Superior Hiking Trail for some time. I might have the opportunity to get onto the trail on July 4th but I am finishing up a 24 hr shift in the ER and will be the only physician able to make hospital rounds on the 4th so I am doubtful that I will be able to finish up with enough time to do a small hike (and the traffic back and forth from Duluth will likely be horrendous).   However, I hope to get a new FitBit and I should have the opportunity to do some day hikes in the Appalachians later in July (but not on the AT). Finishing up the Superior Hiking Trail will have to wait until August.",,View Entry,"Jun 27, Tue",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573628,"I just got back from the Appalachians. I was even hiking in the mountains. But unfortunately my recent trip did not meet up with the Appalachian Trail and my thru-hike doesn’t start for another 240+ days (crossing the 250 day milestone while I was out east). 
I was in West Virginia helping to staff the Boy Scout National Jamboree for the past two weeks. I had done this 4 years ago and decided to come back – this time with my wife. She had an absolutely wonderful time. While it was still an enjoyable trip, I found it wasn’t quite as magical of an experience for me this time. 
I should discuss a few highlights from the Jamboree. In no particular order…… 
President Trump came and spoke at the Jamboree. The boys and many of the adults were excited that he came as Obama never came during either of the Jamborees during his administration making this visit the first by a sitting President since 2005. I found out that several other presidential visits had been planned but had to be cancelled including 2001 (which George H.W. Bush’s visit had to be cancelled because of weather) and 1985 when President Reagan had to cancel because he was recovering from colon cancer surgery (although he did send Nancy Reagan to speak). FDR had also planned to visit the very first Jamboree in 1935 but this one never happened until 1937 because of a polio epidemic (and FDR appeared at that one). I think this appearance was good for both the Boy Scouts and for President Trump. President Trump found an enthusiastic audience who frequently cheered (sometimes inappropriately). Considering the Boy Scout oath contains adjectives such as Loyal, Courteous, Friendly and Kind, could he expect anything less?  Here are a few facts which were not reported widely on the national media. First of all, the crowd estimates were exaggerated. President Trump estimated 45,000 in attendance and I saw several media outlets estimating 40,000. However, only 31,000 participants and staff attended the Jamboree to begin with. From one of my friends on the Stadium Crew, I heard that 28,000 people went through the magnetometers and there was only a single confiscation (a Scout forgot the specific instructions and brought a penknife which was not allowed). Here is another media oversight. President Trump started his talk by stating that 10 of the top 12 members of his cabinet were former Scouts including 4 Eagle Scouts including Rex Tillerson (who is a former President of the Boy Scouts and had spoken earlier in the Jamboree when he was able to announce a new building on the Jamboree site will be named after him (perhaps prompted by a 50 million dollar contribution). Trump paraded the Secretaries of the Interior, Health and Human Services and Energy as Eagle Scouts in attendance. He neglected to even mention a fifth Eagle Scout, Attorney General Jeff Sessions who may be on his way out of the administration. While it was appalling that Trump chose to make a non-partisan event political, the kids will never remember anything about what Trump said but they will remember he came. The pageantry including a flyover around the stadium with Air Force One and then a motorcade arriving over the opposite hill, and the band playing “Hail to the Chief” will always be remembered by the boys. This was certainly the case for me remembering my first sighting of sitting president – Gerald Ford as I don’t really remember anything he said. The media uproar that followed reveals that the Boy Scouts are still relevant. I had several friends on the Stadium staff. One of them was on stage and he saw where President Trump stopped using the teleprompter (where he waxed politically).  The Boy Scouts perhaps anticipated Trump going off script as the opening prayer prior to Trump arriving was given by a Muslim Scout in Arabic before translating this to English. The musical acts included X Ambassadors and Plain White Tees (which were apparently very recognizable by the Scouts and had been the top two acts the BSA had recruited). The fireworks show was incredible and was reportedly one of the ten largest fireworks displays in the United States this year (partially because at least one of the owners of Zambelli Fireworks (possibly the largest Fireworks companies in the US) is an Eagle Scout and has been supportive of Scouting).  The closing show also had a wonderful guest, Creek Stewart, as well as a section of quotes designed to help a Scout have a successful life. I hope these are published on line as I would like to show them to my local Troop as well as the Rotary Club. They provided values instruction in a fun way. Between advice such as “Do what you love and love what you do”, there were nuggets such as “Always leave the toilet seat down”, “5/4ths of the world has trouble with fractions”, and “Even Luigi has to win occasionally”.  Creek Stewarts lessons were: Some people will think you’re crazy, but push forward anyway.
What makes you feel most alive probably has something to do with your passion.
Bring your Boy Scout pocketknife with you to college.
Do things other people are not willing to do.
Leave no trace in the woods, but leave a big trace in the world.
A Scout is not perfect but should strive for perfection.
Never forget your roots in Scouting.   I was able to accomplish my hiking goals for the week. During the last Jamboree, I never had the opportunity to hike to several regions of the Summit Bechtel Reserve. This time I was able to visit every area I had seen last time as well as nearly all the sites on the rest of the Summit. My busiest day involved walking over 32,000 steps during which I hiked up to the top of the mountain where the Big Zip (North America’s 2nd largest Zip line) as well as all of Adventure Valley. I also was able to climb and explore all the activities on Thrasher Mountain and the hill where the FoxTrot BaseCamp was situated. While there I explored the back side (as I had heard there was another large hill), and found a military encampment on a promontory with a view (possibly having anti-aircraft artillery there as well. Several states’ National Guards used the Jamboree as training exercises. I know our medical unit was helped each day by two members from the Connecticut National Guard. The position of the military seemed to be that they were required to do two weeks of training exercises every year and the Jamboree (particularly with a presidential visit) gave them real life experiences with setting up defensive and first aid positions. During the several days of training before the boys arrived, I was able to do one of the smaller Zip lines which at 1100 feet was still the longest Zip line I have ever ridden. The person who assisted me in putting on my harness had obviously never done this before as my harness was initially put on inside out. My wife absolutely loved this (as she had never ridden any sort of Zip line before). She also really enjoyed bunking with two other women around her age. Nearly the entire staff was very friendly as you had to be a good person if you were willing to give away two weeks of your vacation to pay to help provide medical care for others. I was given a supervisory position – being the lead physician for my shift with the Alpha-Bravo Medical group. I had been with the Bravo medical tent last Jamboree. Compared with that, Bravo had been given a 10% increase in staffing, but because of understaffing in other units, we were asked to provide care for both Alpha and Bravo camps – effectively giving us a 100% increase in the number of Scouts. We were responsible for the health needs of over 11,000 people and we had over 1400 visits during the Jamboree (about half of which were only for self-help).  I found myself dreading some of my shifts as there were times we were absolutely deluged with Scouts seeking care (particularly every evening after they came back from programs or after the big shows) and I just kept worrying about having to handle a true medical emergency with minimal additional help available. Each shift was supposed to have several physicians and a mid-level provider. During the second half of the Jamboree, my team included myself, a neurologist from New York and a chiropractor. While the chiropractor was popular with the staff, she really wasn’t able to see many patients. I heard about two staffers suffering heart attacks (but I don’t believe either died) and one participant (who was probably an international attendee as 57 countries were represented) came down with a case of malaria. Our unit narrowly avoided a suicide when a boy was found hanging by one arm on the outside of a tall bridge. He was talked down by other Scouts (who will be getting a heroic citation at their home Councils later this year). While this Scout had a history of mental illness, I could only imagine the media frenzy complete with unfounded accusations of bullying if the suicide had occurred. While most of the boys had a great time, a large Chaplain staff was kept busy with some depressed and homesick boys. I had always heard that ministers are often more effective than full time mental health counselors, but I got to see it in real life here. I also appreciated how all the ministers recognized their duty was to be non-denominational. Too many people get caught up in the particulars of their own faith – forgetting that every religion has good people. I have always liked that the Boy Scouts encourage Reverence but don’t specify how this is to be practiced. I always close my meetings with the quotation “May the Great Scoutmaster of us all watch over us until we meet again”.  
There are already a lot of preparations already in place for the 2019 World Scout Jamboree which will be hosted by the US, Canada, and Mexico. They are expecting 45000 participants so it will be much larger than a regular Jamboree. This will the first time the US is hosting it since 1967. The medical staff was being actively recruited as there are large concerns that West Virginia will not allow Canadian and Mexican physicians from practicing medicine during the Jamboree. I know I had to submit an application to get a temporary West Virginia camp medical license. I won’t make any decisions about returning for the World Scout Jamboree until after my thru-hike. I had forgotten how sticky the east coast can be during the summer. Even when it cooled down at night, everything (particularly my clothes and sleeping bag) was sticky and gradually became damper. I had to deal with blisters as I had not done anything more than hiking on a treadmill for the past several weeks when my partner was gone on a fly-in fishing trip to Canada. I will have to step up my plans to prevent chafing as I had some minor issues during this trip. I’ve lined up two people who are willing to meet me during my Thru-hike and serve as Trail Angels – one in the DC area as well as someone else from southern Maine. I’ve already offered that as long as they help me get my laundry done and groceries purchased, I would take them out to the nicest restaurant in the area which would allow in someone dressed like a vagabond. I might even get to do a zero with them. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy had a booth at the Jamboree. I visited it (even bringing my AT membership card) and talked with one of the ATC’s employees about my plans. The younger gentleman (and several other people with AT experience) didn’t have a clue about what my trail name referred to. This coming weekend, I will be returning to an AT state for a quick weekend trip when my nephew gets married in Kennebunkport, Maine. Because of the short duration of this trip, I will probably not get the opportunity to do any hiking in the mountains as we will probably stay close to Coastal Maine. 
Events like this one remind me why I am still active in Scouting and why I wanted my son to be a Boy Scout.

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573943,"Over the last several years, I have been following several hikers on YouTube. I have learned a tremendous amount from their experiences both with gear selection as well as ideas for managing life out on the trail. One of these hikers has been Bigfoot. He has an active Youtube Channel https://www.youtube.com/channe...  which has blossomed after he hiked the Appalachian Trail in 100 days last year. Since then he has been producing frequent videos about a range of topics still mostly about the Appalachian Trail but he has also been branching out onto the Superior Hiking Trail. He is from Minnesota so this is probably the best hiking trail in our area. He wanted to attempt to break the fastest known time hiking the entire Superior Hiking Trail unsupported. He has done several shakedown hikes getting ready for this. Because of him being reasonably local (about 2 hrs away from me in the Twin Cities) and his interest in the Superior Hiking Trail I became a Patreon supporter of his for $5/month. With this, I have been given the ability to follow his hikes through his Garmin InReach satellite locator. During his shakedown hikes, I was even able to give him some advice when he was hiking over areas that I have already hiked myself. 
This week he is attempting to break the record. Since I have not been able to get into the woods for nearly 2 months, I decided to drive up to the North Shore and find him. My wife was able to keep tabs on him and contacted me as I drove north. I parked in the George Crosby Manitou State Park and headed east. Within several miles I found him climbing a hill. I introduced myself and then reversed direction. We hiked along and I found I was able to keep up with him (it helped that he had already hiked 20 miles that day!). We kept up a lively chatter during the five additional miles to the site where the current record holder had camped for the day. Bigfoot continued on for another ~3 miles while I had to hike back to my car and then make the long drive back home. I arrived home at 11:55 pm. 
I clearly got the sense that he enjoyed having someone to talk to. Several times he commented that he had never seen another southbound hiker so had not been able to talk with anyone for the first 3 ½ days of his attempt. He said that right before I encountered him, all he could think about was eating 4 double cheeseburgers from McDonald’s. I would have given him trail magic, but with the nature of his attempt, he was unable to accept anything (even refusing to let me pack his trash out). We talked about some of his challenges but he was willing to discuss my upcoming AT hike as well and I gleaned several pieces of advice from him. We kept up a good pace the entire time and he was still going strong when I left. If he does set the record, I believe that this trip was worth it to have helped him in a tiny way. He even took a brief video of me but I’m not sure if it will show up in his channel (and I don’t think I’m that photogenic anyway). According to my FitBit, I hiked 23,000 steps and the equivalent of 159 flights of stairs. It was great getting out in the woods again (even if it was on an area of the trail I had already hiked).  

After this, Bigfoot’s attention will be switching to the John Muir Trail as he was able to win a pass during this year’s lottery. This will be interesting to watch as well. He is also willing to do a shakedown of my pack next winter before I start my thru-hike. 
There are so many Vloggers this year. Most of the ones I started following have already quit the trail for various reasons. As I have time, I will watch some of the successful thru-hikers during the long winter. I have also been watching some people who are preparing for next year like me. Seeing how many of this year’s hikers don’t have large followers, I doubt that I will even attempt to do any vlogging. Now if I can only figure out how to do posts like this from the trail……",,View Entry,"Aug 02, Wed",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574602,"Within a week of getting back from the Jamboree, I found myself on a plane heading to Maine. This is very unusual for me to be doing this much traveling. However, I had agreed to staff the Jamboree prior to finding out when my nephew was going to get married so I really didn’t have a choice about the timing. Since we flew into Boston, I actually visited three AT states  as we had to drive from Massachusetts, through New Hampshire and into Maine.  Unfortunately, we never strayed far from the coast so I never got even close to the AT.  

My nephew currently works in Boston. He married a young woman from southern Maine. The wedding and reception were held in Kennebunkport, Maine. The resort was elegant (but very high priced!).  We had some adventures getting out there in time (particularly when Alamo ran out of cars after Midnight on the date of the wedding and couldn’t honor my previously made reservation). The wedding itself was very nice (but very modern with some very atypical portions of the ceremony (e.g. having a dog in the bridal party, the minister was another nephew who had taken an on-line course to be able to conduct the wedding, and having a ceremony using un-aged whiskeys mixed together to improve with time). It was nice seeing my family as this was the first happy occasion my family has gotten together for several years (not counting the final reunion of all nine siblings prior to my sister dying later that year in 2015).  

My wife and I spent a few days in Maine before heading back home. We were able to explore Kennebunkport (walking down to the gate in front of the George H. Bush vacation home).  I was also able to do some Geocaching, took a small educational cruise on a lobster boat (during which time I had the opportunity to handle and band a lobster). I had no problem getting my 10,000 steps every day (but didn’t get a lot of stairs except for the two flights of stairs to my third flood room).  I also had several servings of clams and had both a whole lobster and a lobster roll. 
My wife and I also travelled to Freeport to shop at the main LL Bean stores. While there I was able to find a pair of trailrunners which feels very comfortable (Keens). I also bought a pair of convertible pants as I am still not settled on what pants. The salesperson who was talking with me also encouraged me to try some socks made of Primaloft so I will try these sometime soon.  I will be wearing on the trail. I also am considering downsizing my portable battery. I currently have a 13,000 mah Anker. However, particularly at the Jamboree (and then talking with BigFoot), I noticed that it takes forever to recharge. I can probably downsize to a 10,000 mah model for significantly less weight without really limiting my ability to have power on the AT.   

I also made my YouTube debut. In this video at the 4:37 mark, you can see me with Bigfoot. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7IG2mVMr50  Unfortunately, BigFoot did not set the record as he had to come off the trail later on in his trip. 
The entire trip out to Maine, I kept thinking about next year. In less than 20 million seconds, I will be on the AT myself. The time can’t go quickly enough!",,View Entry,"Aug 09, Wed",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575295,"I was able to get back on the Superior Hiking Trail on Tuesday. This time my wife decided to come along. I initially thought she might be able to drop me off at one end and then I could walk just one way. However she wanted to walk along the trail herself. We drove to the Hartley Nature Center and decided to hike the southernmost section that I have not yet hiked. We stopped inside the nature center. While the outside was beautifully landscaped with large prairie flower gardens, there wasn’t really a lot to look at inside the center. While there were a few displays including some live captured animals (the large snapping turtle being the most interesting), most of the center was an auditorium and meeting rooms which really didn’t have any appeal for us. 
We then found the trail and headed out. I found there was a spur trail which went to Hawk Ridge which I have heard a lot about through my experience as a birder. Apparently this is one of the best places on the north shore of Lake Superior to observe migrating raptors as they will not usually cross Lake Superior directly so they fly over this high point.  I might have to return for this migration some fall now that I know how to get there. 
We headed up the trail. My wife primarily enjoys road walking but isn’t much of a backpacker. We walked two miles together (walking miles at 26 and then 44 minutes/mile which is considerably slower than my usual 18-22 minutes/mile).  After these two miles, she stumbled and mildly hurt her knee so she didn’t want to continue. While she turned around, I headed up the trail further for the additional two miles until I got to 4th St. in Duluth where I had turned around this past spring. There was a moderate amount of road walking during part of this where the trail wrapped around the back of the University of Minnesota – Duluth campus.  The final section of the trail was a relatively steep hill along the edge of a beautiful creek which cascaded down to Lake Superior.  By the time I finished the 8 mile round trip back to the Hartley Nature Center, I didn’t have enough daylight to conveniently walk the last 3.1 miles to finish up the lower 100 miles of the Superior Hiking Trail (as my wife wanted us to go to dinner and we had a very enjoyable meal at the Tavern on the Hill near the University of Minnesota – Duluth).  I’ll finish this section on another Tuesday afternoon after overnight call. 
During this hike, I experimented with some trailrunners. At LL Bean, I had purchased some Keens (although I don’t recall the exact brand). I had already been using Keens as my primary boots and these felt far more comfortable than any other pairs of shoes the salesperson suggested. My wide feet and bunions really limited what sorts of shoes I could even try. These seemed to function fine. I didn’t really miss the lack of ankle support (but I also didn’t roll my ankle as the trail was relatively dry and well-maintained. I also experimented with some LL Bean padded socks made from Primaloft . Between the new socks and shoes, my feet didn’t feel the best (but I didn’t develop any blisters). I think most of this is related to the socks as there seemed to be an uncomfortable seam where they tended to bunch up.  I’m probably going to go back to my Injinji toe socks as my go-to brand of socks although I plan to experiment with some Farm2Fleet Damascus socks before the AT hike. For shoes, I will probably start with my usual ankle high boots but then will convert to these trailrunners after the White Mountains of my southbound loop after my trail legs should have developed. 
With all my recent trips, it was nice to get out into the woods again. Only 225 days until the AT!",,View Entry,"Aug 16, Wed",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575489,"I had a small retirement recently. Perhaps the first of many to come……

I retired from playing softball in the local church league softball league. When I first moved to the little town I am in, I had assumed that I would not be good enough to compete in a county league. I was also very busy during my first several years here. However, after having lived here for about 15 years, there was a cry from the pulpit for softball players. I figured that I used to love playing softball and I could at least be a warm body but I worried about the 17 year gap from the last time I had played softball (once during my residency).  To my surprise, I found out that I was still a fairly good player. I had a reasonably good swing and hit for average fairly well. I could occasionally even hit the ball over the outfielders’ heads. I could field well enough to play an infield position (although I usually played second as my arm accuracy was inconsistent).  I also loved playing! I eventually even became the manager for our team and donated money for several sets of uniform T’s and several premium bats.  My goal was to keep playing until I could play along with my son. When he was young , my son usually came along and had lots of fun getting to choose whatever he could get at the snack bar for a few bucks and chasing down foul balls and home run balls for the reward of a piece of gum.   While he kept getting stronger and faster, I gradually slowed down a bit (particularly with my lateral range). 
I realized during this season, that I would miss next season as I would be on the Appalachian Trail. My son will also be starting his senior year and then will be going off to college. Our days of playing together are probably over.  I’ve also had my share of injuries. The nurses routinely would laugh when I would come limping into the hospital limping and all I had to say was “softball”. While most of the injuries resolved within a few days, there were a few which seriously limited my playing time such as when I tore the medial head of my gastrocnemius (calf muscle) or when I tore my pubic symphysis.  These injuries prevented me from playing for eight and 12 weeks respectively.  I realize I am getting a bit too old for this younger person’s game.  Hopefully I won’t suffer any similar injuries on the trail next year (which remains one of my biggest fears). 
On my final game, we lost in the tournament in an unusual slugfest 30-29. I finished this last game hitting five for six which was my best offensive outing for the year. I also played error-free in the field. While I am disappointed we lost, and I am sad that this era of my life is coming to a close, I suppose I should be happy that I went out on a high note. 
This may be the first of several retirements for me.  While I think that I won’t be ready to fully retire from work (either financially or emotionally),  I know that I will be stepping down from my church council position as well as the Chief of Staff at our local hospital before I leave  (only agreeing to serve in these roles knowing they would end before my trek).  
I’ve recently discovered a podcast which I have been truly enjoying.  I heard about it from Spielberg (the AT hiker from 2016 who christened me with my tentative trail name) as he was interviewed on this podcast.   http://mightyblueontheat.com/The-Podcast/  By some serendipitous chance, I had been currently reading the podast’s author’s book at the exact same time I found out about the podcast.  I’ve been gradually making my way through the podcast archives. One guest divided AT hikers into Aspirants (young people who hadn’t yet established their careers), Retirees (obvious) , and Tweeners (people who were making life or career changes but who weren’t necessarily ready for retirement. At this time I am still not sure whether I am a Tweener or perhaps an Aspirant Retiree.  This is one of the dilemmas I hope to work through while on the trail next year.  Are you an Aspirant, Tweener, or Retiree?",,View Entry,"Aug 18, Fri",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575887,"I just got back from another trip. This has been a very busy period of travel for me. I took this past Monday off and drove down to southeastern Nebraska to see the solar eclipse. I had requested this day off months ago as I saw that the path of totality for this eclipse passed directly over the small town where my wife grew up (and where her parents still live). This seemed like a perfect excuse to visit. 
The drive down was easy. We met my wife’s sister at the Omaha airport after she flew up from Arizona. This is the first time that my wife’s family got together for several years (since her parents celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary). On Sunday, we also drove to Lincoln to visit two of my nephews who are attending the University of Nebraska (which is also where my wife graduated). We also visited the couple who got my wife and I together. (My wife and I met having to walk up the aisle together as we were both in the wedding party – We were also eventually married in that exact same church). This former roommate and fraternity brother who was one of my groomsman is now the Vice-Provost for the University of Nebraska. 
The morning of the eclipse, I got up before dawn and headed out to Waubonsie State Park - just over the bridge from Nebraska City, NE in southwestern Iowa. I haven’t been here for several years. This is in the southern portion of the Loess Hills which are an unusual geologic formation (only found here and in one place in China) of hills formed from windblown sand. The morning of my wedding I went on a hike here before going back to civilization. I had thought I had gone alone that morning, but one view reminded me that another of my fraternity brothers from Cornell University had also accompanied me. This was a great way to spend the morning and get another hike in with some hill climbing. 
According to Endomondo, I hiked just under six miles and enjoyed the late summer woods and prairies on the top of these hills. The hills were up to 350 feet in height but the majority of the walking was on ridgetops. I would have continued to hike, but I know my wife was getting nervous about me being on time for the eclipse. I was also a bit worried about traffic but this was minimal and I got home with plenty of time to spare. 
Rather than watch the eclipse in town, my wife’s family wanted to go out to the old family homestead. My wife’s home burned down more than 20 years ago but they still farm the land. We eventually set up in the cemetery across the street from where their house used to be as it was mowed better and was on a hilltop so better views were obtained. We had the place entirely to ourselves. The eclipse started shortly after we got up there. We had been fretting about the possibility for lousy weather all weekend. When we first got there, we got a few glimpse of the sun through clouds but most of the time we were unable to see anything though the goggles. It even rained briefly during the first few minutes. However, after about 15 minutes, the low clouds cleared up and we were able to watch the eclipse with only occasional interference from clouds. I was able to even find a new bird for my life list as there was a Northern Bobwhite in a nearby tree (surprisingly). I used a call from an app I have installed on my phone and was able to have a conversation with the bird (as well as several birds from neighboring territories) and eventually spotted it. This was a lot of fun while we were waiting for the main portion of the eclipse (and for the clouds to clear). 
Totality was amazing. This was definitely something worth seeing. I can now cross this off my bucket list. Because of the high clouds, we weren’t able to see shadows of crescents under trees (which I had seen during a partial eclipse several years ago), but with the goggles, we were able to identify all of the significant changes around totality. We experienced the drop in temperature and heard the birds awaken after totality ended. Seeing a 360 degree sunset in all directions was also amazing. This was one hundred and one seconds of pure awe. 
The traffic home was absolutely horrible. Right from the start, we could see significant traffic in my wife’s hometown which usually only has 250 people (on a good day). The typical eight hour drive dragged on over 10 ½ hours with traffic only finally lightening up around midnight after we got north of the Twin Cities. In hindsight, we should have stayed another day or two with my in-laws but this option had been taken away because my son (who didn’t want to miss his final weekend at Scout Camp (where is was on staff as a Counselor) said that he had to be picked up early on Tuesday morning.",,View Entry,"Aug 22, Tue",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576105,"After returning from the Eclipse, I drove out early the next day to pick up my son from Tomahawk Boy Scout Camp where he had been a counselor all summer. I then had the rest of the day free (as it was my usual Tuesday off).  I decided to head up to the Superior Hiking Trail to finish out another section. Today’s target was the section between Beaver Bay and Silver Bay. I had ended a hike last August at Silver Bay and this past June I had started a hike in Beaver Bay but had missed the five miles between the two trailheads. 
I made the uneventful drive up there and set out from Beaver Bay. This section of the trail was the most heavily travelled of any non State Park section I had ever been on. I ran into more than a dozen hikers who were out section or thru-hiking. I only saw a few day hikers like myself. There was one group of seven guys but then several couples and a group of three women. I guess because the bugs are starting to decline, the trail is becoming more popular now. 
This section of trail was far more scenic than I had expected. There were several high overlooks but the trail also had an extended hike along the Beaver River and passed several small lakes along the way. It was a very enjoyable day. While it did rain for about 15 minutes, overall the weather was great. 
I finished up the “IronHeart” book and then listened to two podcasts from “This American Life”.  I really find the trail goes by a lot faster and you don’t notice as many aches and pains when your brain is listening to interesting materials. 
I definitely liked my trail runners more on this second hike. I used a pair of Injinji socks and these did not slide around as much as the last pair of socks I had purchased at LL Bean. One of the thru-hikers was using a ULA Ohm 2.0 which is one of the packs that I am seriously considering bringing with me next year (vs the Z-Packs ArcBlast). We both agreed that the bag is very nice and we both like how easy it is to access the side pockets for drinking water without having to take the pack off.  At this point, I am leaning towards starting the trail with this pack. I might have to change out the belt on the Ohm as it is definitely sized for a larger person and may not fit me after I start losing weight. 
This closed out a large section of the trail between the Encampment River and the Caribou River Wayside. When I get the last two gaps finished south of me, I will have finished the entire lower half of the trail. I am planning on finishing out the last 75 mile section during the second week of October. 
The ride back home was a bit tiring as I really hadn’t had much sleep, but by munching along the way, I made it safely home again. I am still amazed at how much I enjoy getting out in the woods exploring new ground. Hopefully this enjoyment lasts all of next year!",,View Entry,"Aug 23, Wed",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576252,"I had to make another trip this past weekend. This summer has had more traveling than any in recent memory. This weekend’s destination was Marshfield, WI where I had to attend my second Board of Directors meeting of the Wisconsin Academy of Family Physicians. This was about four hours away from my home so it was a relatively short trip compared to most other destinations in Wisconsin where meetings are held.  
Because I was able to leave relatively early on Friday evening, I decided to try to get some hiking in on the way to Marshfield. I decided to hike another section of the Ice Age Trail. Today’s destination was the Hemlock Creek section between Bolger Road and the Murphy Creek Recreation Picnic Area. I only had about an hour before sunset so I wasn’t sure if I would have to do some night hiking. 
It had been a cool day with the highs only in the low 60’s and the trail was a bit damp but it was not raining. I know the last several outings I had not been pushing myself as my mile times had been consistently in the 19-22 minute times. I hadn’t been sure if this was because I had been fighting a bug, or if subconsciously I had been slowing myself to prepare to start the Appalachian Trail slowly, or if I had simply lost a step as I am getting older. Either way, I decided to push myself a bit. I only had time to do 4.34 miles according to Endomondo but my average pace (including all stops including several photos, restroom breaks, crawling through several downed trees and figuring out where I was going) was 17:06 minutes per mile. The area was relatively flat with only a few hills as the maximum altitude was only 151 feet higher than the lowest altitude. I did a total ascent of 446 feet over the 4+ miles. I guess my relatively slower times weren’t because of aging! 
I also ran into a bear while I was on the woods. Even though I know there are a lot of bears around my area (and I even shot and harvested one myself about 15 years ago)  I have been surprised at how rarely I run into bears on the trail. I am much more likely to run into them while driving or walking on my road (where they have learned to find food from garbage cans!).  This was a large boar (I estimated him at least 400 pounds) which had just finished crossing a bridge over a creek which I had to cross. Fortunately, he got one look at me and took off running into the woods to my right.  I didn’t even have to raise my voice or do anything to get him to run away. I have practically no fear of bears and routinely will run after them unless I hear cubs running up trees (at which point I know that mom will not be running away). I have partially developed this lack of fear through experience (as I average over 5 bear sightings a year around home and this average had been much higher when I had been feeding them at my old home out in the woods when my record was nine separate bears in a single day). I also know patients of mine who are little old ladies who have chased large bears off their decks using only a broom to protect their bird feeders.  I did recently learn that you should not threaten a bear who has a cache of food (such as a deer carcass) as they are much more likely to be defensive and may not run away. 
The other issue I was considering was my foot traction. On the way to the picnic shelter, I know I was watching my feet a lot as there were a moderate amount of both rocks and roots which could have slipped me up. As the woods were darkening after sunset, I was no longer able to watch my feet. Surprisingly this didn’t slow me down (as I guess I had been more concerned about night-hiking or getting to my destination (as I still had 3 hours to drive).  At this point, my legs are in pretty good shape and they nearly automatically help keep my balance no matter what I stepped on. Except for a small slip or two (particularly on slick roots) which my hiking poles saved me from falls, I was able to hike at the same speed I had been doing on the way out. If I can get this degree of fitness early on, I won’t need to use hiking boots as long and hopefully will be able to look around at the scenery.",,View Entry,"Aug 26, Sat",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576401,"Saturday morning I attended the Board of Directors meeting of the Wisconsin Academy of Family Physicians. I felt that I contributed much more at this meeting as I had a better understanding of what was expected of me. I raised the issue about declining Public Health Budgets across Wisconsin after our county's public health budget has declined from $405,000 to $126,000 in just three years. I also met the Vice Speaker for the national American Academy of Family Physicians. He is running unopposed for the Speaker position. He was a very nice man. He seemed very interested in my National Health Service Corps experience. Because President Trump has recently discussed decreasing the funding for the NHSC, he even took my business card and contact information as he even mentioned that there was an outside possibility that I might get asked to testify in support of the NHSC.  

After the meeting adjourned, I started the drive home. I drove about an hour and then drove to Perkinsville. Last year (after I had started writing this TrailJournals account) I had started at Highway 64 and hiked to Lake 11. Today I parked at the Sailor Road Parking area and hiked south to Lake 11 to finish out this segment. The total roundtrip hike was 10.2 miles which I completed in 3 hrs and 24 minutes. The total ascent was ~1350 feet. 
The weather for this hike was not great. A band of heavy rain had just passed through the area. I still decided to go out, but while the heavy precipitation had largely finished, the trail was quite wet. There was certainly periods of light rain, but underneath the forest canopy, this was not heavy.  I have still been somewhat concerned about my rain system. I am still debating on a rain jacket. The jacket I have (from Alps Mountaineering) is too heavy and is too warm (even with pit zips). I eventually just took the jacket off after my body heat warmed me up. I will definitely carry a rain jacket with me but partially as part of my cold weather gear. When the weather warms, I may change to a kilt. 
My other larger concern about rain is about my glasses. I have had too many experiences where rain droplets makes my glasses practically unusable. Wiping these seems to simply spread mud around and I have never been happy about carrying dry cloths to clean these (as they usually only have a single use before they are too wet to use again).  Readers will recognize the same Tilly Airflo hat in most of my pictures as I really wanted the wide-brimmed hat to prevent this from happening. The Tilly hat worked well in this regard. However, with the cool wet weather (low 60's again) my glasses did start fogging up. I am thinking I may have to bring some anti-fog compound with me on the AT. I also had some droplets on my glasses from branches that I pushed off the trail. The hat can be smushed in the bottom of a backpack and can easily be washed. It also has a lifetime guarantee. My hat even has the Philmont Cattle symbol branded on the back rim (done during my trek last year in New Mexico).  The straps (both front and back) make the hat extremely secure even in high winds. While it was expensive, I will definitely bring this Tilley Hat. 
The final concern about my glasses is whether or not I should bring a backup pair of glasses. I am nearly blind without my glasses so I have always backpacked with a second pair. I know hikers usually pack their fears and I simply assumed I should have these. I have never broken a pair of glasses on the trail. Therefore, to save weight, I am considering not bringing an old set of spectacles.  In an emergency I can make pinhole lenses using duct tape or cloth which could hopefully allow me to get me off the mountain to somewhere  where my wife could ship my glasses to me. I still have to weigh most of my gear so I am not sure how much of an issue this is but I am considering not bringing my backup glasses.  I do like the Transitions lens on my glasses as I never have to remember to bring sunglasses. Finally, thanks for the shout-out from Hummingbird Ellie about my last post concerning bears. I realize that one other reason I am not worried about bears is that I have hiking poles. During college at Cornell University, I took a fencing course. I figure even if a bear were to attack me, I believe I could still defend myself using these makeshift epee's. I also remember watching an Andrew Skurka video in which he threw one of his hiking poles at a charging grizzly and successfully scared it away. The only think I don't like about my Zpacks Duplex tent is that the hiking poles are not immediately available in the unlikely event they are needed for defense. Hummingbird Ellie's entries are interesting. I know that I will probably want to know much of the history of the places and names on the AT when I am hiking. Unfortunately, at this point, there are simply too many minutiae to remember. I don't know where she is finding all this information but I'll know I'll have to look back at her entries when I am on the trail.",,View Entry,"Aug 28, Mon",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576556,"I had a free Tuesday so I headed up north again. Today’s goal was to at least get at least one section finished with the option for a second section.  I had had another busy ER shift (our summers are always busy as the county population doubles until the vacationers and snowbirds leave for the winter). I was only able to lie down at 3:30 am. 
By the time I finished up my morning rounds and drove to Duluth I only had about five hours of possible hiking available. Before I left one of my friends relayed some devastating news and I guess I was more upset about this than I had initially thought. First I forgot my phone (hence no picture with today’s post). Then I missed my exit (and had to make a detour to the trailhead). The day was not starting out well. 
Today’s section may have been the least scenic of the entire Superior Hiking Trail! It started with about a mile and a half of road walking. When it finally got into the woods again, the trail was very muddy. There was a single nice overlook but there was a lot of trash at the bottom of that cliff. I was not in a particularly good mood when I finished the section and started back. 
On the way back, I decided to take a break at the overlook. If I sat back from the edge, I didn’t have to see the trash. The weather was perfect with temperatures in the mid 70’s, low humidity and a bright blue sky.  The rocks were also warm from the sun. I sat down and had a drink of water. Rather than race back to the trail, I even laid down for a bit. To my surprise, I woke up 90 minutes later when another hiker came along. I guess I needed the rest. The hiker was also section hiking the SHT and she hopes to have the trail finished by next fall. We were both simply finishing up this section today. 
For the day, I only hiked 6.2 miles. The nap probably helped me because by the time I got back, my mood was definitely better. I headed back home a bit earlier than if I had stayed and done another section. Because I didn’t have my phone, I wasn’t able to listen to any books or report any stats from Endomondo (but I did get 14,000 steps and the equivalent of 55 flights of stairs according to FitBit). 
This section completes a large swath of the Superior Hiking Trail. I have now completed from the southern terminus to Reeve’s Road (a distance of more than 105 miles).  My goal of completing the entire trail by the end of this year appears to be possible (assuming I will be able to finish a 70 mile section in the north over a five day backpacking trip planned for October). 
I realized that I should clarify my prior posts about bears. While I am not afraid of bears, I still maintain a healthy respect for them. Our county has had several bear attacks. Most of these have involved hunting. I know of several around bait or dogs (such as one hunter who was bitten while he was trying to get his dog away from the bear). Another person was mauled on the trail when the bear was fleeing from another hunter coming to monitor his bait station. One non-hunting related injury involved a woman who was mauled by a bear when she was pregnant. She had just dropped off some trash in her garage but then returned quickly to the detached garage for another reason. When she got to the garage, a bear was already inside it. The bear scratched her in several places while it was trying to escape.  I also had one of my physician partners nearly get attacked. He had been deer hunting when a sow and cub came along. He initially thought this was nice to watch. However, when the bears got directly underneath him, he was concerned that they had gotten a bit too close. So he made some noise. This was the wrong thing to do as the cub quickly scampered up the closest tree – the one from which he was hunting!  When the mother realized where the potential danger was, she also climbed that tree. My friend describes the bear drooling and the odor of the bear as there was a brief standoff with the mother growling at him. My friend only had a bow with him and didn’t really want to (and may not have been able to) shoot the bear. Finally the cub climbed back down the tree and the mother followed it without any altercations.   

Finally I will relate that I have touched a live bear. One winter, the DNR was looking for bears with young cubs to adopt some orphaned cubs whose mother had been killed during an accident where they were clearing an area and the mother was hibernating underneath a large downed tree.  Local hunters were asked to monitor bear dens with the hope of finding one with cubs in it. One of my friends knew of a den on his property and he took me along one day. The high temperature was only 10 degrees so we weren’t too concerned about the bear being awake. We found the den but did not see any cubs. My friend told me that I could briefly touch the bear if I wanted. I did this but only hit fur (as their hair is surprisingly quite long). However, the bear did stir and I saw its head at the far end of the lair. I figured I might never get a chance like this so I pushed down harder until I actually touched the bear’s body. I then made a very hasty retreat! (as bears have been known to come immediately out of hibernation if they feel threatened).  It turned out that this was a boar as it never did have cubs. I thought it was also interesting how the adoption process worked. If the cub was simply inserted into the den, the mother would probably kill it. However, the DNR realized that the recognition process involved smell. Now, when they adopt a cub, the mother is anesthetized and then the babies and the sow are slathered in Vicks. By the time the Vicks wears off, all the cubs smell the same!  
You are much more likely to get injured by another hiker’s dog than a bear on the Appalachian Trail. The host of the MightyBlue podcast had to go off the trail because of a dog bite which got infected.  I know that one person was attacked by a bear on the AT in 2016 but this is still an extremely rare event considering how many people are using the trail.",,View Entry,"Aug 30, Wed",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577434,"This past weekend, I was able to do some more backpacking along the Superior Hiking Trail. This was the first overnight backpacking I’ve been able to do in just over three months. I’ve got a five day window to finish up the Superior Hiking Trail in October. I had a 74 mile stretch between Grand Marais and Caribou Wayside which I could do, but that plan was a bit ambitious as there wasn’t much room for error if I had an injury, bad weather, or some other reason I might not be able to finish. This will be my last free weekend before the October trip as the only other weekend I don’t have work responsibilities I will be camping with the Boy Scouts. 
After I got permission from my wife (which wasn't a major problem as she was having to spend the whole day in the Twin Cities while my son took his ACT's for the second time), I was able to arrange a shuttle from Sugar Loaf Road to the Temperance River. I wanted to finish up the two furthest south sections of this big gap. Because the Caribou River Wayside is closed (because they are doing a massive construction/enlargement of it as I found out when I drove by), I would have to hike from the Temperance River to where my car was parked at Sugar Loaf Road and then hike the additional three miles there and back for a 20 mile hike. 
Right from the moment I arrived, I could tell that something was up. There was no parking available??? As a matter of fact, I had to drive ¼ mile further up the road before I could even find a parking space on the side of the road. Apparently there was some sort of gigantic run going on. Runners had the option of running either 50 or 100 miles. They all seemed to have large support teams who would feed and water the runners as they finished individual sections of the trail. The shuttle practically couldn’t even turn around. We eventually  made it to Temperance River and I found there were lots of support people here as well. During the entire first 8 mile section I had to continually dodge runners coming the other way. I tried to be courteous and nearly always stood aside. I said Good Morning to countless runners. Some would answer back. Some would merely nod. A few would talk briefly. If they tried to step aside to let me by, I would usually say that they were in a bigger rush than I was (and after the first leaders, several people said that they weren’t really in that much of a rush – merely hoping to finish. A few runners thanked me for sharing the trail with them. Some of the runners had Pacers (written on their race number) along with them but I couldn’t really see what these people were doing except offering mental support as the Pacers usually seemed to be in better shape than the runners.When I did pass the occasional backpacker, I expressed surprise and stopped to talk to them. Several of them were making thru-hikes as this is the best time to do this as there are minimal bugs right now and the trail is still reasonably warm. Several were only hiking short distances to campsites, particularly along the scenic Cross River. 
Because of the runners, I didn’t even start any audiobooks until after I saw the race volunteers removing the extra flags to mark the course. The trail was generally good but there were certainly muddy sections which were generally torn up by all the runners. There were a few beautiful overlooks and the day was gorgeous after having a nippy start of only 39 degrees at home. It warmed into the mid 60’s and was overall a beautiful fall day. These cool nights will trigger the transition from green to colored leaves. When I am on the trail in a month, most of the leaves will have fallen (and some trees were already turning color). Many locals were complaining that we never really had a summer as there were very few hot days the entire summer with most of the summer only having highs in the 70’s. I guess I hadn’t noticed this as much as I had had two weeks of summer in West Virginia during the Boy Scout Jamboree. 
When I eventually got to Sugar Loaf road, the trailhead had finally cleared out. I walked the quarter mile back to my car and then drove back to the trailhead and parked. I then hiked the final 3 miles to the Caribou Wayside. It was a bit sentimental remembering when I had been there first and I was even able to find my campsite where my Boy Scout crew had done our final shakedown hike prior to going to Philmont last summer. This was the first time I had ever set foot on the Superior Hiking Trail and I had obviously fallen in love with the trail as all these posts show. I then hiked 1 ½ miles back to Crystal Creek Campsite and settled down for the night. For the day, I hiked over 41,000 steps and climbed the equivalent of 250 flights of stairs covering about 19 miles. I had a quiet night which was a bit nippy but I was dressed warmly enough. It only got into the low 40’s overnight. It was great to get back on the trail again (although perfect weather always helps!).",,View Entry,"Sep 10, Sun",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577590,"Sunday morning, I woke to another clear blue sky. I realized overnight that I could use the one clip on the ceiling of my tent to hang my glasses. While the campsite wasn’t quite flat, I slept reasonably well but did wake up several times (partially to pull myself up on my sleeping pad, partially because of noises in the night, partially because I usually only get 6-7 hrs of night and I was lying down nearly 10 hrs). 
The next morning, I was surprised to wake up and found that I did not have to hobble. By this time of the year, I am able to do a 20 mile day without undue strain on my system. I set off and walked the mile and a half back to my car. Because it was such a nice day and I had gotten my goals for the weekend done yesterday, I decided to finish up an optional loop on the Superior Hiking Trail. Unfortunately, after only making this brief hike and driving about 45 minutes south, I found that my second day hiker hobble had returned. So much for wishful thinking that I was getting in great shape! 
The Split Rock River Loop is a five mile section which showcases some beautiful scenery around the cascading Split Rock River. The Superior Hiking Trail mentions that the western side of the loop was closed. I drove to this area first as this is where I thought the loop ended. While it was very muddy, the trail was definitely not closed. Because I had forgotten that the trail along the eastern part ends quite a ways from the river so I didn’t run into it as I started up the trail. The major reason why the trail was closed is that a large bridge at the top of the hill was out. Hopefully there are plans to replace the bridge next year. When I got up to the top of the hill, I saw that the river wasn’t really deep in many flat areas but could be quite dangerous to cross around the rapids areas. I bushwhacked a ways upstream and found a place to cross. I was able to rockhop across the first half of the river. I then found a large rock, removed my shoes, socks, and the leggings of my convertible pants and was able to cross the river without getting any clothing wet. I then took a brief nap in the sun while my legs dried and started on the trail back down the hill. For the day, I walked nearly 8 miles. After today's hike, except for an 8.3 mile section which I hope to finish within the next two weeks, I have finished 217.2 miles from the southern terminus as well as the 54 miles from the northern terminus. In mid-October, I will have five days to finish the remaining 58 miles. The completion of this goal is very much in sight! 
During this hike, there were some new pieces of gear I experimented with. The biggest one is Farm to Feet Damascus socks. These are merino wool with extra padding only around the toes and heels as well as ventilation channels along the foot and the calf. I definitely like these better than DarnTough socks as they are much more comfortable. I had minor problems with one of them forming a ridge, but I am pretty sure this was more a problem with my liner which I had stolen from another smaller pair of shoes. While I tend to like Injinji toe socks as these are probably better for my bunions, if I do start to get a hot spot, these are nearly impossible to wear on top of tape or bandaids on my toes. I may bring one of both of these socks as well as a third pair of socks for sleeping. 
I also used my ULA Ohm 2.0 Backpack again. I really like this pack better than the Z-packs ArcBlast. While the ArcBlast may be a little lighter, it simply doesn’t feel as comfortable. I also like the fact that I can grab (and replace) water bottles from the side pockets without taking off my pack. I did have one problem with this pack. The white curved metal bar (which serves as the suspension for the pack) started riding up inside the pack. I will have to do some research as it probably came loose from some attachment site. At this point, I am thinking about starting the trail with this pack and then possible switching over to the ArcBlast as I become more conditioned to the trail particularly if weight becomes more of a priority. 
I also found a new pair of hiking pants which I will probably bring on the trail. These are L.L. Bean Cresta Zip-off Hiking Pants. They were very comfortable, seem to be built durably, and had pockets in the right places (with zippers to secure important items). 
I also used some Patagonia Capilene lightweight long underwear and pants which I had seen other hikers talk about. I used these simply as sleeping clothes as they are very lightweight and they seemed comfortable. I am still not completely sure how I will layer my hiking clothes as I layered a merino wool shirt with a polyester shirt for the cool mornings. The polyester was comfortable and was warmer but definitely got quite wet from perspiration after the day warmed up and I started working up a sweat. 
Once again I brought way too much food along. I wanted to have a selection of snacks (and frankly I wasn’t overly worried about having too much food as I wanted to be carrying a bit more weight to simulate how more food would feel). While I can have some luxury food items to start out on the trail, these items would probably be better appreciated when hiker hunger kicks in. I will work on my food selections during my upcoming October hike. 
I have passed two other minor milestones. The first most important one is that I will start my hike in less than 200 days! The other one was the one year anniversary of writing in TrailJournals. I have averaged about one entry a week. Hopefully someone has found some value in my ramblings!",,View Entry,"Sep 12, Tue",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578065,"I was able to get back to the Superior Hiking Trail this past Tuesday. Originally I had hoped to do 16 miles but I didn’t have enough time for this today. I was on the trail around 2:30 as I had been asked to testify for a guardianship case by phone so I had to make sure I had signal. 
The day was beautiful. Morning clouds had burned off by the time I arrived. The Maples were just starting to turn and there were essentially no bugs. Even though I don’t remember any recent large rains, the trail seemed unusually muddy. However, there were some particularly scenic sections traveling along Silver Creek with a few maples in full glory. While it is pretty to see the leaves change, I am not looking forward to the coming long winter (although I will be on the trail before next year’s spring green up). 
On the way back I stopped at the Silver Creek Campsite and found a thru-hiker. He had started at the Canadian border several weeks ago and was making good progress towards his goal. He is a retired pharmacist from Kansas City. He has also hiked the entire AT. In 2015, he hiked 1800 miles before having to stop with three fractured toes. He finished the last 400 miles last year. His trail name is Recalc (and even had this marked on his food bag). We talked for over an hour. He also uses a ULA Ohm 2.0 and had even seen another SHT thru-hiker earlier in the day using one as well. He loves this backpack with the only complaint being lack of ventilation on your back during hot months. He also had had the white inverted U support come loose from his backpack and eventually had the company repair this. I will have to look into this. 
Recalc was very friendly and really seemed to want to talk. He had only talked to one other person the entire day. After talking with him, he thinks I will do very well on the trail with the preparation I have done. He stated that he approaches life much more confidently after completing the trail. He seemed a bit older than me, but he also reported having been diagnosed with pre-diabetes before his hike and he has managed to keep off most of the weight he lost on the trail (and his numbers no longer indicated pre-diabetes). I offered him a few snacks, but he had just resupplied and said that he had more food than he needed for the rest of his hike. He is another hiker who doesn’t understand my trail name. 
For the day, according to Endomondo, I hiked 11.61 miles. According to FitBit, I climbed the equivalent of nearly 100 flights of stairs, I now only have a 3 ½ mile section just north of today’s hike to do before finishing the last large section in mid-October to complete the entire Superior Hiking Trail. Because sunset is already coming approximately two hours earlier than around the Summer Solstice, I simply didn’t have enough time to finish this today (as it was I returned to my car in the dark but I never had to turn on my headlamp as the final section was a ½ mile roadwalk.  

I am officially registered as a 2018 Appalachian Trail Thru-hiker. Registration just opened yesterday. I am number 147. You can make your free voluntary registration at this link:  https://www.atcamp.org/   Last year, hikers who registered also got an official AT yellow tag for their gear. 
Another AT milestone was also set. I was made an administrator for one of the AT class of 2018 facebook groups. At that point, our group had several hundred members but another one had over 1000. Our group is now the largest group with ~ 1800 members. There are far more discussions going on (as well as a few flaming posts which I helped to shut down yesterday).

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578612,"This past weekend, I had originally been scheduled to go camping with the local Boy Scout Troop. However, on Friday afternoon I found out that not enough boys had signed up so we would not need to camp. As such, I needed to make alternate plans for my weekend. My wife had already made plans of her own to get together with some of her girlfriends and they spent a weekend in Waupaca, WI which is several hours away. 
I knew that I was running out of trails on the Superior Hiking Trail in which I had not already hiked so instead, I drove about 80 minutes away to south of Birchwood, WI to do some more hiking on the Ice Age Trail. When I had driven to Marshfield last month, I had hiked up to Murphy Flowage Park so on this trip, I started from that parking area. I then hiked south to the next parking area just off Stout Road. I then had to hike back. According to a guest on Mighty Blue’s recent podcast, a section hiker calls this a Flip-Flop hike and I liked this term so I’m using it out of context compared to next year’s Flip-Flop hike. 
The weather was very hot. Because this has tended to be a cool summer, this was one of the hottest days of the year with temperatures in the mid 80’s.  There was a bit more color in the woods but with the heat, a few more mosquitoes out, but overall the bugs weren’t bad at all. Today’s hike totaled 11.0 miles but because the area was relatively flat, I only had a total ascent of 2070 feet according to Endomondo.  The trail was not particularly scenic. There was a small amount of gravel road walking but a much larger amount of hiking on snowmobile trails. While this trail does not have the natural beauty of the Superior Hiking Trail, it is still nice to walk on trails I have never been on as I may be working on my next long trail (but probably will not be able to finish this for many years as there is a lot of road walking on the Ice Age Trail). Unfortunately, the beauty of the woods in fall does not last long. 
I listened to several more “This American Life” Podcasts as I didn’t really feel like starting a new book (after finishing up the Stoneheart Trilogy during my last hike). I have also finalized another small piece of gear. I will be using Koss FitClips headphones. These are small and lightweight. I have always had a hard time keeping simply ear buds in my ears but these are designed for athletes with an extension which fits over the ear. Surprisingly I have tried 4 other varieties of over the ear headphones but most of them have horrible acoustics (unless I continually pushed them into my ear – not very practical while hiking). This variety naturally seems to fit into my ears and is very comfortable (as there was one variety with a plastic extension below my ear as well so they fit by pulling my entire ear lobe into the headphone (which was not particularly comfortable). I got the light blue color. The biggest reason I kept experimenting with other varieties was because the marketing which came with the headphones said that they were designed for women. I don’t think my ears are particularly effeminate, but if something is more comfortable and optimizes my listening experience, I will use it regardless of what sex it was designed for (and to be fair, there were many Amazon reviews and questions which stated that they work fine for men). 
That evening, I came home and then walked on the treadmill for an additional 12 miles as I watched the Iowa Hawkeyes play college football against Penn State. I had done my residency at the University of Iowa and have been rooting for their football and basketball teams ever since (particularly because I had attended Cornell University for college and the Ivy League is not known for their sports teams). The game was extremely exciting (which always makes walking on the treadmill much easier) but unfortunately ended poorly for the Hawkeyes when they lost on the very last play of the game.  I am optimistic that watching these games (and then basketball games) will give me plenty of opportunities to stay in shape during the coming long winter. For the day I walked more than 45,000 steps. 
I didn’t even feel too sore the next day. I didn’t have any blisters as my feet seem to have hardened up over the course of this summer. The only malady I suffered from was sore nipples (caused by my shirt rubbing against them). I have heard about marathon runners experiencing this. I will have to wear bandaids over them the next time or two. Perhaps losing some weight (to get rid of my man-boobs) would also probably help.  The following day, I decided to go on another shorter hike (only four miles) on the Governor Knowles State Hiking Trail after finishing up paperwork from work and before my wife would be expected home. I was a bit depressed realizing the warm days will be ending soon as our local chorale had its first practice of the fall as we started practicing singing Christmas Carols in preparation for our next concert (as the high temperature on Monday was 20 degrees cooler than Sunday’s). 
I won’t be able to leave the County for the next two weekends so I was glad I was able to make good use of this weekend. The heat didn’t really bother me (as I recognized I had to drink a lot more water than usual).",,View Entry,"Sep 26, Tue",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578670,"Yesterday I had a free Tuesday and decided to finish off another segment of the Superior Hiking Trail. I had saved this 3.5 mile segment for a Tuesday day-hike after not being able to finish it last week. I will not be able to get in much hiking for the next two Tuesdays so I decided to head up north even though the weather didn’t look great. 
Fall has definitely come to the upper Midwest. After a weekend of temperatures in the mid 80’s, the temperatures today were only in the mid 50’s. While we had some heavy rains when the front passed through, it was evident that this area of the Superior Hiking Trail had gotten far more. While this trail tends to be known for a moderate amount of mud, today was truly excessive. There were many areas of standing water and thick mud on the trail. I regularly had mud or water flow over the tops of my trailrunners. When I finally made it home, my pants were caked with mud from my knees down. While there was a fair amount of color, because we still haven’t had a frost, there was still a lot of green, and the recent storm had knocked many of the colored leaves onto the ground. 
There were a few nice climbs on this segment. I ended walking about 8 miles according to Endomondo and climbed the equivalent of more than 100 flights of stairs. The weather started out somewhat drizzly but this had stopped by the return half of the hike. The Encampment River (which I believe I mistakenly referred to as the Embarrass River in my post from my hike here from the other side of the river this past June) was really swollen. The water was very muddy. I thought about fording it, While I had been able to skip on rocks easily this past June, this was not possible as not a single stepping stone was left uncovered. In fact the far riverbed which had been dry in early June now had several feet of water across it. I walked in up to my knees (only a few feet) before turning around and starting the trip back to my car. 
Because everything was wet, I slipped quite a bit but fortunately didn’t have a single fall. I did tweak my knee a little bit but this only hurt for a few minutes. I wish I could be starting the AT with my legs in good shape as they are now. 
By finishing this section, I have now finished the entire lower 217 miles of the Superior Hiking Trail. Considering I also have already done the northernmost 54 miles, I only have around 52 miles left to hike on the trail. I have a five day extended hike schedule in a few weeks to finish this section. My goal to have this trail finished by the end of the year looks very attainable. However, on the trail today, I was fearing that I will see some snow on this upcoming trip as it will be a week later than last year’s (and I have certainly seen snow this early in October in prior years). 
The biggest piece of gear I experimented with today was PC Pro Compression socks. Someone in the 2018 Facebook group had suggested these along with a 60% off coupon so I decided to try them. I have already started to get some varicose veins and I had recently noted that while my calves are much larger than they were this past spring, my right calf was definitely larger than the left (probably due to having a bad tear of the medial head of my gastrocnemius muscle caused by playing softball during the summer of 2015). I recall at that time my entire lower leg became black and blue and I even had an ultrasound done on my calf as I was worried about a blood clot. As it happened, while I did not have a clot, I did have a 6 cm pocket of blood inside the muscle where the muscle had torn. Our visiting orthopedist did not suggest doing anything for this and it did heal (after limping on it for just over 8 weeks). Also, while I am definitely trimmer than I was this past spring, the scale doesn’t really show any weight loss. 
I decided to start wearing my compression hose on Monday before going to work. I wore them all night long (as I do know that my legs tend to swell more after not getting a full night’s sleep). They were a bit uncomfortable the second day (as they were tight – even though I got the L/XL size. My legs certainly didn’t feel better by pushing the lactic acid containing fluid out of my lower leg (which was the theory about why a hiker would want to wear compression socks). I also found that I hadn’t even lost any weight. At this point, I don’t think I will be bringing these along on the AT (but may still use them while traveling).",,View Entry,"Sep 27, Wed",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579527,"It’s been several weeks since I last posted. Part of this is because my home desktop computer has died. It was five years old so I shouldn’t be too surprised. I just hope I can retrieve a few documents from it. I still don’t have a new one yet. 
Fall has definitely arrived in the upper Midwest. Last week I dropped off my pontoon for winter storage and then removed my dock (docks have to be removed otherwise the three feet of ice that is coming will destroy them). I realized that I will not even be able to pick up my boat next summer as I will be gone the entire time. That thought was a bit sobering. I might even rent it out next summer to pay for the extra year’s storage fees. 
I also received a patch for hiking more than 100 miles on the North Country Trail (all on the Superior Hiking Trail). I did this last year (and now am a member of the North Country Trail Association).  Perhaps after I finish up the Superior Hiking Trail, I will start to hike sections of the North Country Trail in Wisconsin (although there is lots of road walking required). 
This past Tuesday, after taking overnight ER call, I attended the Burnett County Board of Health and visited several of my patients in an area nursing home. As soon as my partner arrived back in our service area from his vacation in Wyoming (which is the primary reason this year's trip is about two weeks later than last year's), I then drove up to Duluth and stayed overnight at a hotel prior to making the two hour additional drive further north to Grand Marais to pick up my shuttle to finish up the last 54 mile section of the Superior Hiking Trail. It looks like I will achieve this goal!",,View Entry,"Oct 10, Tue",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579576,"I woke up early and made the beautiful drive north to Grand Marais to catch my shuttle. There was frost on my car windshield when I set off. It was dark initially but then I had many beautiful views as the sky lightened and the sun eventually rose over Lake Superior. I was pleasantly surprised to see as much fall color. This part of the world also has had a very late first frost so many of the trees were turning colors later than usual. I guess I lucked out by having to have my trip delayed for my partner’s vacation (even though he didn’t get an antelope which had been his goal). 
I picked up my shuttle with Harriet Quarles who had transported me last year from Grand Marais to the northern terminus of the Superior Hiking Trail. On that trip I had to hike 53 miles back to my car. For this one, I was hiking from the Temperance River State Park back north to Grand Marais. The distance was 54 miles but this section was reported to be much hillier than the more northerly section. Harriet was engaging as usual and told stories the entire way. She related how one naïve hiker asked her where she would find cell phone charging stations on the trail. I suggested that she should have replied that they are at all the escalators which help you climb the hills. Harriet also hinted that a very popular Youtube celebrity from central Minnesota who has over 50,000 followers because of his educational but very humorous videos regularly uses marijuana when he backpacks on the Superior Hiking Trail. I’ve never met him but I do subscribe to his videos as I have learned a lot from them.  I will wonder a bit less where he gets his goofiness from. 
It was still below freezing when I set out. I had realized that I had forgotten a shirt at home which I had planned to use as an second layer on my torso. I still had several other layers in my pack but I decided to set out as I didn’t really want to dig into my pack. I had also read that it is usually a good idea to set out feeling cold and then wait for half an hour to see if you were still cold. As long as I kept going and the wind wasn’t bad, I quickly warmed up and didn’t use a second layer until the final day. I was very impressed by the short sleeve Icebreaker merino wool t-shirt. I used it the entire trip. Even though it remained cool, I still got some precipitated salt from dried perspiration yet the shirt never smelled the entire four days on the trail. A shirt like this (perhaps a long sleeved one to start out the trail) will definitely be coming with me on the AT. 
After following the Temperance River north for a while, the trail quickly ascended nearly 1000 feet (which is one of the steepest climbs on the entire SHT). I took the spur trail and eventually summitted Carlton Peak which had some very nice views in several directions.  There was another hiker on top who had been doing a few nights on the trail and we talked a while. 
The trail dropped in elevation quickly then rose again rapidly up to Britton Peak which most notably had a view of the prior peak. If the Appalachian Trail has a similar series of large hills, I can see that it will be challenging (and that this section of trail is good training for it). 
I eventually ended up walking 14.62 miles according to Endomondo. My Fitbit reported that I had walked over 33,000 steps climbing the equivalent of 258 flights of stairs. I got into camp at West Rollins Creek. I walked to East Rollins Creek and found a pair of young men who didn’t seem too friendly (and had a magnum of whiskey with them) so I stayed at West Rollins by myself.  For supper, I made two separate small one person meals. One of these I had purchased from the hostel I stayed at last year which was from a local company based in Grand Marais, MN.  http://www.shop.trailcenterlodge.com/Camp-Chow_c2.htm  I had a single serving (only about 300 calories) of Black Bean Burrito. I then also had Herbed Mushroom Risotto from Good to Go. I had received a sample packet through my subscription with Cairn (a company which sends out monthly packages of outdoor related gear and food whose shipments I have enjoyed (and has allowed me to give away superfluous gear to needy scouts as I upgrade my own stuff). Both of the meals tasted great. I had the entire campsite to myself. I am thinking about ordering more of the Camp Chow meals to have shipped to me on the AT as the idea of living off Rice Sides doesn’t sound too appetizing to me. This was the first time I had camped in a hemlock grove. It was easy to find spots to hang my bear bag safely. I have used the PCT method and always struggled to get the correct height using the stick. Today I didn’t use the stick and found I was able to control the location of the bag easily and made sure it was safe from all directions. I stopped using the stick the rest of the trip and had no problems getting a secure hang. Does anyone know why the stick was considered necessary? 
The night was reasonably warm. While frost had covered the ground when I set out, clouds had started to filter in and they prevented the temperatures from dropping too much. However, I had to get up and go to the bathroom during the night. It is highly unusual for me to have to do number 2 overnight. Unfortunately I had left my toiletries kit inside the bear bag so I used some leaves and then an extra bandanna to clean myself (and cleaned the bandanna the next day). I believe this was caused by the Cremini mushrooms in the latter food packet rather than the spicy foods in the former. I have had this effect from wild mushrooms before. While these mushrooms are not poisonous, for some people (myself included) many wild mushrooms have a strong serotonergic effect which stimulates bowel function. I will probably stay away from this variety of prepared meals in the future. I will also always keep my toiletries kit inside my tent (even though there are a few smellables inside it). Overall, this was a great first day out in the woods which combined both a physical challenge as well as many artistic views associated with the fall color.",,View Entry,"Oct 11, Wed",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579626,"I didn’t want to get out of bed the next morning. I didn’t get moving on the trail until 9:20 as I putzed around getting organized. I know I overpacked a bit again as I would rather train with a heavier pack and have a necessary piece of emergency gear than not. I also again made the error bringing too much food. Between these two “mistakes”, I hardly had any extra room in my backpack. I had to strap my tent to the outer portion of my pack. However, after having eaten a full day’s worth of meals, it was much easier to fit everything inside my pack. 
 I also decided to hike without my headphones for the morning. This clearly made the hike a bit harder. I had developed two hot spots the day before over the callouses on my bunions but with a bit of leukotape, I never developed a blister there. I just seemed to notice lots more aches and pains and there was very little natural birdlife to keep me occupied. During the afternoon my hike was much more enjoyable listening to the new Dan Brown novel “Origin” which was another enjoyable read (as I have enjoyed all of his novels). 
The trail started with a walk along a ridgeline and then we had to climb another series of mountains. On one of these, there was a spur trail to the Lutsen Ski Resort Gondola (pictured) which I took as I had never visited the resort before. The day was definitely overcast and there were brief sprinkles but the day generally remained dry. 
I filtered water from the Poplar River and made it past Lake Agnes. This was one of the most scenic campsites along the entire trail but both campsites were already occupied and it was still too early in the day for me to stop. Instead, I made it all the way to Jonvick Creek campsite which was far less scenic overlooking a beaver pond (and I brought along extra water from a stream as I usually try to avoid drinking from beaver ponds. That evening I made a prepared shrimp meal which was far outdated but which I wanted to use up (as the fresher prepared meals will probably get used along the AT). I also ran out of butane as I had started with two canisters of fuel (knowing that one of them might run out). I figured that I could dispose of the spent fuel container when I went through a state park. The only trash cans along this section were along a .4 mile spur trail to a parking area at Lutsen Ski Resort so I simply kept my trash as the walk didn't seem worth it. This spot turned out to be a nice campsite as it was in another hemlock grove with some scenic maple trees resplendent in red leaves (a relative rarity on the SHT which has lots of yellows and browns and a few orange hues). That night I believe I was visited by a curious Pine Marten. These animals are a fair sized member of the weasel family. I initially heard the calls in the tree above me and then during the night, it repetitively called from behind my tent. I had hoped to possibly see a moose along this section but I didn’t even see any tracks or scat. Except for the campers at Lake Agnes, I only ran into a few day hikers today. 
For the day, I hiked 34641 steps and climbed the equivalent of 251 flights of stairs. According to Endomondo, I backpacked 15.5 miles. I really felt dead when I finally got into camp and didn’t even want to set up camp. I am guessing that I will need to start with only 8-10 miles daily next year when I will not be in as shape after the long winter.",,View Entry,"Oct 12, Thu",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579689,"Except for the distraction of the Pine Marten, I slept reasonably well. I woke up several times with pains in my toenails. Even though my current pair of hiking boots is a full size larger than my usual shoe size, I will make sure my next pair of shoes is 1 ½ sizes larger. During the day I didn’t notice this as much, but at night when I rolled into certain positions, the pressure from my sleeping bag onto my toes became painful. I was using a mummy sleeping bag as I didn’t want my Enlightened Equipment Quilt getting any more run down before next year’s hike. I also got out of bed a bit more quickly and was on the trail nearly 40 minutes earlier than the day before. 
There was a moderate amount of mud on the trail initially today. I believe I have mentioned mud and the Superior Hiking Trail several times in this journal. However, recently mud has become a much larger problem as my shuttle driver told me that it had rained 21 days during a 27 day stretch in September.  Because I had been hiking in the hilliest portion of the trail, it wasn’t as much of a problem here than it has been in other areas of the trail. 
After climbing out of the valley where the campsite was, the trail largely followed the northern edge of a ridgeline. I had some nice views to the north, but much of this area had already been defoliated and was much less scenic. Eventually I started descending into Indian Creek at which point I had a wonderful view of Lake Superior. The picture with this post doesn’t really do it justice as Lake Superior was sparkling as the sun was shining directly on it towards me. I have another picture where the lake is a beautiful blue color but didn’t have the sparkles (or the red bushes). 
After descending and then climbing back up from Indian Creek, I entered Cascade River State Park. This was only the second state park since I started the trail. I had a collection of trash including a spent container of propane and several days worth of food wrappings which I hoped to drop off. I walked around Cascade River all the way down to the Highway 61 parking area and then back up on the other side. Unfortunately, I never found a garbage can. I didn’t want to walk another mile or so to the park headquarters so I decided to simply carry my trash for the rest of the trip. The volume of it somewhat surprised me (but each day it became easier and easier to pack my backpack). There were a moderate number of people in this park but most of them didn't want to talk. Otherwise I believe I only ran into two backpackers all day. 
The trail then went uphill along the Cascade River. While this was quite scenic, it was also quite steep and prolonged. This was about a 1000 foot climb before I made it to the campsite. At the end of the day this was probably the hardest part of the entire trek. According to FitBit, I walked 32,900 steps and climbed the equivalent of 256 flights of stairs. According to Endomondo, I walked 14.87 miles. When I made it to North Cascade campsite, I was very tired and was then forced to descend a steep hill down to the Cascade River again to get water. I was a bit worried about leaving my pack alone in case a bear walked through camp but at that point I was too tired to care. The river was very nice and I even soaked my feet in the cold water for a while before returning to camp. 
For dinner that night I was happy to see that my Pocket Rocket boiled water MUCH faster with a fresh fuel canister. I used a several year old sample pack of Packit Gourmet’s Bangers and Mash which was excellent. The portion size had nearly 2000 calories so it was almost too much but I thought I might send some of these to myself on the trail which I would consume relatively soon after leaving a town (as they were heavier than the usual dehydrated meal). Unfortunately, I found out that Packit Gourmet no longer sells this variety. Even so, I have certainly enjoyed their meals so this company is becoming my favorite for trail meals. 
Without the blanket of clouds, the air cooled rapidly after the sun set. I could tell that we would get below freezing reasonably soon. I had started to sleep with my Sawyer Squeeze inside my sleeping bag and found that I never even noticed it (even when I was waking up because my toes were hurting against the inside of my sleeping bag).  As soon as my bear bag was hung and everything put away, I quickly went to bed to get out of the cold. I had seen a forecast which predicted the weather would be taking a turn for the worse tomorrow evening so I hoped I could finish the trail before the weather turned bad.",,View Entry,"Oct 13, Fri",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579723,"It was a chilly night. For the third consecutive night, I had the campground completely to myself. While my sleeping bag was warm enough, I woke up chilled several times and had to adjust the zipper and the muffs around my neck to stay warm. In the morning, there was a thick rime of ice inside the entire tent. On previous trips, I had had some problems with condensation inside my Z-packs Duplex tent but the first two nights I had woken up with hardly any condensation (even on the night when it was drizzling and I had to put down one vestibule). The frost was thick enough that I briefly considered making a snowball out of it (but quickly squelched that idea when my hands quickly chilled when they were out of the sleeping bag. 
Because of the cold, I got out of the tent quite slowly and didn’t get started until the sun had reached my campsite. With another day’s worth of food gone, I found I was able to stash my tent inside my backpack again. For this trip I used my Z-packs Ark Blast backpack. I found that I really didn’t use the front pockets very much. I did find I could get water bottles out of the side pockets without taking off the pack.  The volume seemed just a bit smaller than my ULA Ohm 2.0. The front chest strap and the over the top straps seemed a bit cheap (and very narrow). I found that the straps immediately underneath my shoulder pads kept wanting to slip on the left side and that adjustment point kept coiling. The mesh pocket also developed a single broken thread at the junction of the top mesh and the hem. Overall after this trip, I started to like this backpack a bit more but still probably prefer the ULA Ohm a bit more. At this point, I plan to start with the ULA Ohm (assuming I can get the problem with the loose support bar fixed) but may switch over to the Arc Blast as my hike progresses (possibly after I return for my son’s high school graduation) as it is a bit lighter. 
When I did get started, it was cold enough that I wore a fleece on top of the Icebreaker shirt. This kept me reasonably warm and the temperatures quickly rose when the sun came out. Today was the flattest day as there were two moderate climbs to start the day but then most of the trip seemed relatively flat until the very end when I would have another significant hill.  
One sign by the Cascade River had indicated only 9.9 miles to the Gunflint Trail. I kept expecting the trail to end and it kept going on and on and I was getting tired earlier each day after walking over nearly 15 miles every day so far. For the day, FitBit reported that I walked 30,900 steps and had climbed the equivalent of 163 floors. Endomondo reported I walked 14.35 miles (with hardly any side trails so that sign must have been wrong).  This was the fourth consecutive day of over 30,000 steps and I realized that this was more than I should be planning to do when I start the Appalachian. I started to develop some Achilles tendonitis (and even developed the only blister of the trip over my right Achilles which popped even before I knew it had developed (as the left side had been hurting more). This was the first blister I had ever developed in this area. Part of the problem was my boots were finally showing some wear as the black undertread started to show through the regular tread. Also ear the blister, I had a small area where the inside fabric of the hiking boot had eroded away. A final defect showed up where a plastic part of the boot lost its connection to the rest of the shoe (which had been the first thing to go wrong on my previous set of hiking boots). These boots served me well getting me through Philmont and most of the Superior Hiking Trail and I can probably still use them around the house or for day hikes. However for the AT, I will need a new pair of hiking boots one half size larger (and have them with enough time to work them in). This will probably be the purchase for this fall’s REI discount coupon. 
I ran into a few more people on the trail today (as it was a Saturday) but only two of them stopped to talk including someone who was backpacking for a whole week. When I finished the trail, a nice lady was kind enough to snap my picture as I wanted a better picture than a selfie for the completion picture.  Rather than stay in northern Minnesota (where it would have been impossible to find a room when the leaves are turning), I drove home that evening. While it had still been sunny in Grand Marais, before I reached Duluth, thick clouds developed and the skies opened up with a fairly heavy rain with some wind. 
Finishing up this trip means that I have hiked the entire 320 miles of the Superior Hiking Trail. If anyone has been mapping out my posts, I had done two backpacking trips (between Caribou Wayside and Finland and then between Finland and Silver Bay before I had started this journal. I had also done several day hikes along the southernmost part of the trail (not counting the newest parts of the trail which connected the trail to Wisconsin (and are recounted in this journal). Setting this as a goal to prepare for the Appalachian got me out into the woods a lot this past year. It seems almost bittersweet that the trail is now finished but I have bigger challenges ahead of me next year. I can also hike the Ice Age Trail or the North Country Trail when I want to see new terrain. I hope that the stubbornness and persistence to bring the goal to complete the Superior Hiking Trail to fruition portends that I will have the wherewithal to complete the Appalachian. The hills on the Superior Hiking Trail are much steeper and larger than anything immediately near my home and should have given me good training for next year as well.  However, I know from listening to successful hikers that nothing can truly prepare one for the Appalachian.",,View Entry,"Oct 14, Sat",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579948,"This post is a bit late as my replacement home computer has not yet arrived (it should be arriving at the end of this week). Because I had finished the Superior Hiking Trail with a day to spare, I decided to take advantage of the day without obligations to hike another section of the Ice Age Trail. During my last trip out here, I had ended at the Stout Road Parking Area. On this day, I started here and headed south until County Road F O (Wisconsin County Roads are lettered rather than numbered). 
Because of the large rainstorm the day before, there was a moderate amount of water and mud on the trail, particularly the beginning which shared its access road with a snowmobile and dirt bike trail. When I got to the footpath, the road quality was much better. 
There were a lot of deer in this section as I scared up several sets of does in different parts of this walk. The trail was fairly varied. It went through some recently logged areas. There were some significant hills. There were also multiple streams to cross (all on bridges) so the trail was fairly scenic. The fall colors were still evident and there are a lot more maples down here than along the north shore of Lake Superior. This is really a nice time of year to hike in the upper Midwest when the bugs are gone and there is such color. This year there haven’t even been any ticks (which often resurface during the fall). I would love this time of year even more if I didn’t know what was coming (as our first snow is forecasted to fall this Friday night). 
When I got to the south portion of this area, the trail has another road walk (which I have been avoiding on the Ice Age Trail). When I get back here, I will probably start a bit further south. A new Guidebook to the Ice Age Trail has been released and is fairly nice (better than the one for the Superior Hiking Trail). I also continue to like the Trail App (powered by Guthook) which can let me know nearly instantly if I am heading off the trail. I haven’t figured out how to calculate elevation with this app (as I know this will be more valuable on the AT). 
For the day, I walked nearly 21,000 and climbed the equivalent of 153 flights of stairs. According to Endomondo, I walked 9.5 miles (round trip). This was nothing compared to the last four days on the SHT (particularly because I wasn’t carrying a full backpack), but still a decent day.  
During my Superior Hiking Trail, I also realized I neglected to mention another gear item which I had tried out. For this trip, I brought along the Vapur Incognito Flask. This is very lightweight (only 1.1 oz) and holds 10 ounces of your favorite adult beverage. While I could never bring alcohol along on a Boy Scout outing, when I’m hiking by myself, I thought I would like to try this. The 10 ounces was a decent amount for three nights (as I’m not a heavy drinker). The flask did not leak and seemed reasonably durable. It was hard to figure out the volume remaining (ie – how much you had poured). However, it was a real pain to fill and I spilled a moderate amount getting the flask full. I read somewhere that a funnel was suggested to help fill, but that would eliminate some of the weight savings. For this reason alone, if I bring alcohol on the AT, I will simply purchase a small plastic bottle as this would be more solid and still not too heavy. At this point I am thinking a bit of alcohol might help me sleep but I may prefer to simply imbibe only during town stops. The other thing I had hoped to figure out was how to journal on the trail. While I did keep a small paper journal about some of the items I wanted to write about, at the end of the day, I was simply too tired to try to write anything on my phone. I am thinking that on the AT, I will simply take a few notes (probably in my AWOL guide) and then summarize each section when I am in town. I would still have to write on my phone, but hopefully I would have some free time during a zero or nero day.",,View Entry,"Oct 15, Sun",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580806,"I’ve been quiet for the past several weeks. Part of this has been because I really haven’t been much hiking. Things have been busy at work and I went through a series of 4 consecutive weeks without reaching my usual 70,000 step goal. These were the first weeks I hadn’t reached 70,000 since late April! Perhaps this is a bit of pre-trail depression after finishing my Superior Hiking Trail goal and realizing there isn't a lot to look forward to until I leave for the AT?  
I’ve been tuning up my gear a bit as well. With REI’s fall sale and coupons, I have now purchased my rain jacket (an Outdoor Research Helium HD with pitzips) as well as a larger pair of my hiking boots (Keen Voyageur mid-hiking boots).  I also purchased the Appalachian Trail Passport (I wasn’t really sure if I wanted to carry the extra weight but for now I figured why not) and I pre-ordered the 2018 AT guide (looseleaf southbound edition) to update the 2013 guide I’ve been making notes in while watching Youtube videos. 
I did make a quick trip to Madison, WI for the Board of Directors meeting for the Wisconsin Academy of Family Physicians. However, I wasn’t able to do any hiking as my wife and son came along (so he could get the University of Wisconsin college tour).  I also spent a weekend camping with the local Boy Scouts. We’ve had a stretch of cool weather with lows already down to 7 degrees and several snowstorms each of which dropped a few inches of snow (which has since melted). I keep thinking that when the winter starts to come to an end, I will be leaving for the trail. It can’t get here soon enough! I have been getting used to the idea that I will start hiking in fewer days (less than 125!) than I expect to be on the trail (150-200). This notion seems odd as leaving still seems so far away in the future. 
This past week, I traveled with my family to Grand Cayman for a quick vacation. Because I spent two weeks of my summer volunteering at the Boy Scout National Jamboree, I really didn’t have much of a true vacation this year. The reason to travel over Thanksgiving week was to attend a holiday NCAA basketball tournament. The University of Iowa (where I completed my residency) was competing in the inaugural tournament held in this venue. I was able to attend three games. I was a bit disappointed as we lost the first two games which we were expected to win but was able to finally see a victory in the seventh place game. My wife and I went to a sports bar on Friday afternoon and watched the Hawkeyes destroy the University of Nebraska (where my wife attended college).   During the week, I did a bit of shopping with my wife, went on a Rum Distillery tour, visited Starfish Point, and did a bit of Geocaching (as we had already visited several other attractions during a day-long excursion during a cruise here ~8 years ago). This was the first time I ever had driven on the left side of the road (and gave our wiper blades a bit of a workout whenever I tried to signal a turn). We had sublet a timeshare at Morrit’s resort from some friends of our and had a place which opened directly onto the beach so I also got to do a bit of swimming in the ocean. While it was a nice trip, it was far too short. 
I’ll make a different post about hiking on the Mastic Trail in Grand Cayman.",,View Entry,"Nov 26, Sun",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580830,"For my birthday this past June, my wife purchased a book for me:  “1001 Walks You Must Take Before You Die”. I had only completed a few of them (e.g. Superior Hiking Trail and the Freedom Trail in Boston).  As I scanned through various trail descriptions, my eyes were drawn to an entry for the Mastic Trail because I had been considering traveling to Grand Cayman for the Iowa Hawkeyes’ Basketball tournament. After making our reservations, I started to make arrangements to have enough time to complete the trail.  

This Trail is 2.3 miles long and can only be done out and back (unless you arranged for someone to pick you up at the other terminus).  It travels through the interior of the island through some marshy areas. Allegedly, this trail has portions which are similar to the way they were 200 years ago. The Mastic Trail at one point was one of the few ways between the north and south sides of the island. It is named after the Yellow Mastic tree. One of these trees (directly on the trail) is the largest one in the world. The trail goes through several different forest types which vary depending on how dry or how rocky the surface is. There are mangrove swamps and many areas with Ironstone (the local name for ancient coral bedrock). 
I drove out by myself while my wife and kids were still sleeping early one morning around dawn. I could tell I was going to have an interesting experience when I saw an Agouti run across the road as I approached the Trail-head (as I had not expected to see such an exotic animal – but they are reasonably common as the locals call them “rabbits”). I decided to wear long pants as the first part of the trail went through some grown up weeds (and I was a bit worried about mosquitoes).  The first part of the trail was quite easy. I had read some descriptions about how hard this trail was and I thought those reviews were a bit overblown (particularly when you consider the maximum altitude on the entire island is only ~60 feet above sea level).  
However, once the trail started to traverse through rocks, it got much harder. There were a combination of rocks and roots (all of which were slick when damp). I thought this would be good practice for Pennsylvania. Shortly after this section began, I lamented my lack of hiking poles (which I couldn’t bring along as I hadn’t checked any luggage). 
Then I started to see wildlife. I almost stepped on a four foot long snake (which wasn’t particularly scared of me and allowed me to get its picture. I subsequently saw two other snakes, but also saw several small lizards, some interesting birds (including a large green parrot), and two giant hermit crabs (palm sized!).  I also got to see some exotic flowers, an interesting vine cactus, and even some coconuts. Even though it hadn’t rained for the past several days (and prior reviews had warned me to be careful about this trail after a rain), I started to run into wet patches. I had to bushwhack my way around one large wet area. There was one aging bridge across a particularly damp section as well as an extended boardwalk through an old black mangrove forest but the middle section wasn’t well maintained. I eventually made it to the southern terminus and had a break (and even inspected a composting toilet on the trail). On the way back, I saw a large pile of gravel meant for trail maintenance. I started to lament about the lack of industrious help from the natives used to “Island Time”, until I ventured off trail later to find a geocache. This section through a rocky area was much more difficult to walk through as there were many sharp spikes from ancient corals throughout. Once I lost my balance and almost hit my face into a spike of this sharp coral (and actually was happy that I rescued myself by grabbing onto a thorny vine after the branch I had been using to support myself had broken away). I didn’t complain about the natives any longer (although I did take two handfuls of gravel to put into the first standing water on the trail after the boardwalk). The Geocache was very interesting as it was housed in some sort of metal apparatus which required a wrench to open (which was attached). There was also a special type of geocaches (called a Wherigo) which required a special cartridge to be able to find. I was able to figure out how to install the necessary apps on my phone and made a second hike two days later (after a large rain). On this hike, the Wherigo app worked fine. I didn’t see quite as much wildlife but I did see an agouti on the trail, and saw some large slugs. 
I had been concerned about mosquitoes. However, these weren’t really much of a problem at all. I had put on some bug stuff, but found that as long as I was moving, I really didn’t need it. Stopping for brief times to take pictures wasn’t a problem. I only noticed bugs when I stopped for several minutes (primarily for the geocaches or when I was trying to find and take a picture of the parrot high in the trees).  The bug stuff didn’t really help much as I had sweated off all the bug repellent when I needed it. The mosquitoes didn’t really swarm me (nothing like what I am used to in Minnesota and Wisconsin). However, I know I did receive several bites so now I have to watch for symptoms of Zika virus (which is usually a mild self-limited illness unless you are pregnant ). Because both me and my wife are finished having kids, this didn’t really scare me. 
Overall, this was a great experience! According to Endomondo, the trail was actually 2.6 miles one way (but some of the extra length was probably due to going off trail for bushwhacks around standing water and the geocaches). This length was still relatively challenging because of having to go slowly because of the terrain combined with the high humidity (and lack of a breeze in the forest).  I can only hope that my Appalachian experience is even reminiscent of this trail.",,View Entry,"Nov 27, Mon",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581008,"After only one week back at home, I made a quick trip out to Los Angeles. I had to recertify for Advanced Cardiac Life Support as well as Neonatal Resuscitation and I was able to find both courses at the same location. I will not have any additional recertifications necessary when I am on the AT. I had taken ACLS out in Los Angeles several times before as I used this as a way to make tax-deductible trips out to visit my sister while she was battling her brain cancer until she died two years ago. During this trip, I was able to meet my new great nephew (the son of my nephew).

Of course, besides the recertifications, the major reason I wanted to come was to get some hiking preparation done. I really wanted to hike on some mountains. After talking with my brother in law, he suggested driving out to Idyllwild, CA and access the PCT from there. I was also able to borrowing his hiking poles (he had some because he is a former Boy Scout Scoutmaster) because these would have been confiscated by the TSA as I didn’t check any luggage. 
On the first morning after flying out, I drove out to Idyllwild. I was amazed at how picturesque the town was. It seemed to be situated in a beautiful lush pine forest. I found the ranger station and obtained a day permit and parking pass. I drove up to the trailhead and started out.The day started out bright and clear. The ranger had told me that snow often would have covered some of the mountain peaks, but had not happened yet this year. I accessed the PCT from the Devil’s Slide trail. This trail just seemed to go up and up and up. Rather than the hills of Minnesota, the elevation rose more than 4000 feet. I climbed the equivalent of 614 flights of stairs (setting a new personal best in that category – breaking my prior personal record by a little more than 100 flights of stairs). I also carried a lot of water weight with me to get a bit of training – almost 7 liters. As it happened, I had just started to listen to “Skywalker: Highs and Lows on the Pacific Crest Trail and coincidentally, I had just finished the Idyllwild chapter on the plane heading out here.  
I was only able to hike on the PCT for a short period of time. I had hoped to make a loop on the top of the mountain but I got turned around when I went off trail on a switchback to find a bush and then headed back on the wrong way of the switchback and ended back where I had switched off the trail. I decided to climb to the top of San Jacinto mountain (elevation ~10,800 feet – the second highest mountain I had ever climbed after Mount Baldy in the Philmont Scout Reservation in New Mexico last year). The trail was harder than I had expected (and I was a bit out of shape as I hadn’t been exercising as much the last month) so I had to stop several times merely to rest up and catch my breath. I eventually did make it all the way to the summit. I even got to go inside the hut at the top of the mountain where Dixie spent a night when she was making her PCT hike this year. On the way back, I had to hurry as I had not expected it to have taken so long to climb the mountain. I practically walked into two deer. I found that I wasn’t able to hike quickly when descending down a steep grade. I did have my head light with me (as well as my phone) but I was worried about running out of power. As a result, I didn’t use any supplementary light until it was quite dark. I was able to see the trail in the post-sunset gloom for a while but several times I made an unexpected decline where the trail elevation dropped more than I had expected and I had to use my trekking poles to prevent falls (and I never fell once!).  When I did turn on the light, it was easy to night hike so I don’t think I need to upgrade my head light to a higher lumen model before the AT. 
Overall this was a great training exercise. The next day, I could hardly walk  because my thighs and calfs were both sore (possibly because of the many small falls stumbling in the dark on the way down the mountain). I know I walked more than 37,000 steps but I was surprised that I was aching as much. I can see that I will have to start slow next March on the Appalachian. I just wished I lived closer to some mountains as it will be hard to do much similar training close to home.",,View Entry,"Dec 03, Sun",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581053,"Two days after my last hike, I had time to do another one. This would be my last opportunity to hike in the mountains as I had to complete my classes and I head back to Wisconsin on Wednesday. Initially I decided to try to find another section of the Pacific Crest Trail. However, when I got to the Mill Creek Ranger Station, I found out that nearly the entire section of the PCT in this San Gregorino wilderness was closed due to wildfires. I was able to experience some Santa Ana winds at my home of my brother-in-law and today 4 large forest fires were raging in the mountains around southern California. 
Instead, I decided to do a limited hike from the Vivian Creek Trailhead. I wasn’t sure how my legs would handle this. My goal was to hike five miles up the mountain and then return back (as I had to spend some time with my family as well). As I initially started off, I wasn’t sure if I would be able to do this. However, once I put Audible back on (finishing up the Skywalker book and then listening to two episodes of This American Life), I was able to complete the my entire plan. (Perhaps a bit of stubbornness helped as well - lol).  
For the day, I hiked 10 miles (per Endomondo), over 20,000 steps and the equivalent of 311 flights of stairs. The trees here seemed to be larger than at the last mountain. Several of them were completely hollow and reminded me of something akin to the tree in which lived the protagonist of “My Side of the Mountain”, which I read probably 45 years ago. For various sections, the trail followed a picturesque small stream (which was traversed by many wind-fallen trees).  
I also noted that with both of these hikes, I only had a t-shirt on (while I saw other people bundled up). While I like to sleep warm, I seem to enjoy hiking cool (however, I did notice that a wool shirt wicked perspiration better than a synthetic under-armour type shirt. At her request for Christmas gifts, I asked my wife to get me a long sleeved merino wool shirt to start the trail. 
That evening, I could hardly walk (particularly going downstairs). However, the next day I didn’t really feel too badly. This makes me feel a bit more optimistic that as long as I am in reasonably good shape when I start the trail, I suspect that as long as I don’t go too overboard initially, I should be able to stay on the trail while I am acquiring my trail legs. 
Overall, I found I did appreciate hiking in the mountains. There were lots of views out here in the mountains. I am aware that there will be fewer on the Appalachian Trail. The large climbs on the Appalachian Trail don’t scare me as much (although I obviously do have a healthier respect for long climbs now).  It seems there are lots of people who won’t go into the woods more than a short distance or up a hill. I suspect this natural laziness helps to keep the woods more pristine for the rest of us. 
Another milestone was also passed. There are fewer than 10 million seconds until I leave on the Appalachian Trail. While this still seems a long time in the future, I realized it is far less than when I started counting.  Now back to the snow (as we got another three inches of snow last night).",,View Entry,"Dec 05, Tue",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581203,"I just finished being interviewed for the podcast “Mighty Blue on the Appalachian Trail”. Because the usual DocSpot with Dr. Lynne Savino is taking a break for the month of December, the podcast creator Steve Adams asked for volunteers to talk about other smaller trails to help hikers prepare for the Appalachian Trail. I volunteered to talk about the Superior Hiking Trail as much of my preparations documented on this site involved my hikes on this trail.  The talk seemed to go fine. It will be edited and he said I will appear on the podcast in several weeks. Steve said that there was an initial time of 11 minutes but that will have to be cut down as he will edit out the places where we were both talking. I have enjoyed this podcast and its myriad guests. When the podcast airs, I will probably post a link on the Class of 2018 Appalachian Thru-hikers page on Facebook page as well as the Superior Hiking Trail page.  

I have also reached the milestone of less than 100 days until I stop work. I decided not to work on the final Monday before I head out on the trail. I know I will have a lot of chores to finish up before I leave for the trail (e.g. filing my taxes and obtaining a new driver’s license as mine will expire on my birthday in June). While 100 days still seems like an extremely long time, I realize that it is a fraction of the time that I have been documenting on this site.  I have officially served notice at work. I have planned to return to work for at least two weeks in mid-May to be able to attend my son’s graduation (the weekend of Trail Days so I will not be able to attend this event). I told work that I would only work half days with no ER call during that time. This brief period of work also allows me to avoid having to list any lapses of employment for more than six months as I should be back before this would occur. I may add a third week as I probably don’t want to give myself a bit of leeway so I don’t start my SOBO segment with a large bubble of hikers as soon as Katahdin opens (although I am also planning on visiting my sister who purchased a home on Nantucket Island six years ago which I have not been able to visit yet).  I also have a high school classmate who lives on the island every summer as well. The side trip to Nantucket also ensures that my wife will come along. With a rental car, she will drop me off at Katahdin before heading back home from Boston. I may simply slackpack the first day in Maine and then my wife may pick me up for one last night of comfort prior to dropping me off for good. 
We’ve had a moderate amount of snow around here recently. I recently purchased some micro-spikes so I can hopefully do some outside training. However, now that the seventh season of Game of Thrones is out, I will probably be spending a lot of time on the treadmill watching each episode twice (the second time is to listen to the commentary). 
Audible recently had a half-price sale so I purchased about 15 books which were cheaper to purchase directly rather than using my credits. My library has expanded significantly now. I hope that this helps to fend off any thoughts of wanting to quit while I am doing the long trek. 
I will also have to purchase a new cell phone within the next several months as my current one is two years old and is starting to malfunction occasionally. I am going to want an android phone with excellent battery life. Any suggestions? Based on Consumer Reports ratings for battery life, I will probably purchase a Samsung Galaxy S8. 
Finally, I edited this post with a family picture with me and my family singing a holiday song during a recent concert. I hope everyone (if anyone does read these posts!) has an enjoyable Holiday season!",,View Entry,"Dec 16, Sat",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581749,"Happy New Year! 2018 is finally here! I hope everyone who reads this will have a wonderful year ahead. It should be an eventful year for me. Besides seeing my youngest child graduate from high school, I will be starting a sabbatical from work and hiking on the Appalachian Trail. Considering that I have been counting down for a long time, it’s hard to fathom that I will be leaving on the Appalachian Trail in less than 3 months.

For Christmas, my wife gave me an Icebreaker long sleeved Merino wool shirt (funny how she was even able to find the exact shirt I wanted on sale from REI). I plan to start the Appalachian wearing this shirt.  

My interview on the podcast “Mighty Blue on the Appalachian Trail“ aired this past Thursday. It seemed to be well-received. Bigfoot told me that I should call up Steve while I am on the trail, and I may do this if something interesting happens. Bigfoot himself was interviewed as a featured guest and will be appearing within the next several weeks. 
I also received e-mails from two readers of this blog (I guess people are reading this!). I may actually meet one of them after I have been on the trail for several weeks. I know that there also seems to be another surge of people requesting membership into our Facebook group (which now has over 3500 members). I appreciate hearing from readers. Knowing people are out there will also provide me some incentive to make sure I post regularly. 
I have been doing a lot of treadmill walking over the past several weeks. It has been too cold to hike outside (even though a car did just go through the ice on my lake when it drove over an area of thinner ice that the geese had kept open until the last several weeks). After having a lull for several weeks, I have met my step goals every week for the past month. I was able to increase my steps on FitBit to have my fifth consecutive record year. After getting my first FitBit for Christmas 2012, I walked for 2.742 million steps in 2013 followed by 3.197 million steps in 2014. After going to Philmont in 2014 and setting the goal to go on a full Philmont Trek and finding out that I would complete this in 2016, I increased my steps to 3.847 million steps in 2015. I significantly increased my training the next year as I had been worried about keeping up at Philmont. In 2016, I walked 4.515 million steps. I then committed to finishing the Superior Hiking Trail and completing my preparations for the Appalachian. This past year, I set my 5th consecutive record when I walked 4.541 million steps. Towards the end of the year, I was aware that I was close to not achieving this goal so I walked over 10,000 steps for 9 consecutive days. The grand total means that I averaged nearly 12,500 steps every day in 2017. While I didn’t beat out 2016 by too much, there was one less day in 2017, so this was a bit harder to achieve. 
Here are a few other interesting facts. I achieved my goal of 10,000 steps 861 times over the past 5 years and set several personal bests (culminating in my personal best of over 57,000 steps which is more than twice the number of steps of the record high I had achieved during my first two years of using my FitBit. I know some studies have suggested that the average person does not increase their exercise totals using activity trackers such as a FitBit, but the numbers have certainly provided incentive for me. If I am able to hike even half of the Appalachian, I should be able to achieve another record high step total for 2018. Sorry to bore some of you with these statistics, but one of the people who reached out to me this past week uses a FitBit themselves. 
Best wishes to anyone who reads this for 2018. Hopefully you can commit to reaching your own goals this year.",,View Entry,"Jan 01, Mon",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582277,"I have realized that several people are reading these blogs as I have communicated with several readers over the past several weeks. Partially because my AT training has stagnated (mostly just treadmill use but I have achieved more than 100,000 steps for four consecutive weeks), there is less to talk about.  I have been participating in BigFoot’s and the Hiking Viking’s Million Step Challenge. Participants are challenged to walk at least a million steps before March 31st (or slightly more than 11,000 steps a day).  I am in good shape for this challenge so far (and the fear of injury knowing that I will on the trail in less than 10 weeks has gotten me motivated to exercise again). I can sense the skin of my feet is toughening up. 
Because some people seemed interested in my bear experiences, I thought that I should give some advice about ticks. I have some significant expertise in tick-borne diseases (far more than the average family doctor and significantly more than many Infectious Disease doctors who have minimal experience with tick-borne diseases in their area). Many doctors don’t admit how few cases of tick-borne diseases they have actually seen but I have seen literally hundreds.   



When I first came to Grantsburg, the area was in a craze of Lyme hysteria. A new disease was taking over and no one knew how to diagnose or treat it. However, you were at risk simply by going out your front door. Over the years I have realized that whenever there is a lot of fear about something, there is often much misinformation. I set out to learn all I could about ticks. I learned about their lifecycle. I learned about the tick-borne diseases.   I found there were far more ticks in northwestern Wisconsin than in New York (as I believe I only had two bites during the first 25 year of my life living in Westchester county, upstate New York for college at Cornell, and medical school on Long Island (SUNY-Stony Brook) I had only been bit by two ticks (one of which was a deer tick). I was amazed at how many I could find. I actually collected them during a phase that I was doing a lot of birdwatching. When I went out in the woods with my binoculars trying to find a new species of bird, I would often get ticks to climb on to my clothes. In spite of being vigilant to capture them, I still received many bites.  

I talked to the state insect epidemiologist who alerted me to a seasonal variation in tick populations (although this expert wasn’t otherwise particularly helpful as he tended to be mostly only interested in mosquitoes). The picture shows my collection (back when I still had black hair!). I eventually collected over 1000 ticks off myself in less than two years.  During and after my expeditions, I would find ticks and attach them into the binder using my “ticker tape”. The ticks usually stayed alive for several weeks after they were in the binder. Ticks are usually in a state of near-hibernation until they sense Carbon Dioxide (usually from a moving animal). When they detect CO2, they put out their arms and try to hang onto anything brushing near their perch (and NO, they cannot jump). I learned that I could play God with these ticks. Using my breath of life, the ticks would start moving underneath their sticky shackles when I exhaled over them. During my second year collecting, I got my first dog and collected some engorged ticks off her. Many of these laid eggs underneath the tape.  

As an aside, a mother checked on her kids and found them with blood surrounding their mouths. She panicked and asked what they had been doing, trying to find out how they were hurt. They replied. “We weren’t doing anything, Mom. We were just eating grapes off the dog”. The kids were fine but many adults feel squeamish hearing this!  
My collection confirmed the huge seasonal variation of tick numbers. Ticks were usually not able to be located during the snowy months  as they tend to overwinter in the leaf litter underneath the snow. Ticks would start getting active in the spring as soon as temperatures rose to above 50 degrees in my experience (although I have read that some ticks start getting active around 40 degrees). Tick populations in northwestern Wisconsin seemed to peak in late May. My personal record involved collecting 61 ticks directly off of my skin or clothing on a single day. My numbers showed that about 80% of ticks are Wood (or Dog) ticks and these are mere annoyances but usually harmless. My collection also showed me that while some of the nymphs can be exceedingly small, the older nymphs and adults are certainly not invisible as some of them can grow to large sizes (particularly if they become engorged with blood). Around mid-July, tick populations would plummet such that it was hard to find ticks during the month of August. During two years collecting ticks, I only found a single tick during the month of August. After Labor Day, tick numbers would again rise. October tended to have more ticks than September. Some autumns it seemed that there were hardly any ticks, but other years there seemed to be lots. However, you could always count on having lots of ticks every May. There was some seasonality such that some years had huge tick populations. The biggest trend that seemed to make the most sense to me was that tick populations were highest two springs after a large acorn crop (sometimes called a mast year). The idea for this is that ticks rely on mice for the smallest nymphs to survive. If there were lots of acorns, there would be lots of mice and when the smallest nymphs got large enough to bite humans, we had more visits to our clinic. 
There is also a lot of regional variation in tick numbers. Within Wisconsin, tick numbers are far lower in eastern Wisconsin than in western and northwestern Wisconsin. There are very few ticks on the northern portions of the Superior Hiking Trail in Minnesota (although their numbers have been increasing on the southern portions of the trail. It appears that ticks numbers seem to peak along something called an Ecological Tension Zone. This is an area which is between two significantly different ecosystems. For instance, Burnett County (where I live) is considered part of the North Woods as we have many pines. To our south and west, the forests are primarily deciduous. However, we don’t have many of the spruces characteristic of the true North Woods to our north and east.  Nearly every year, Burnett County and neighboring Washburn County have the highest risk of Lyme Disease of the entire state. 
I also received a lot of experience removing ticks. I had originally been taught the classic method which is still taught today about using forceps and applying steady pressure. I dutifully did this. Unfortunately, it rarely worked. I had always heard to never twist a tick. However, I eventually stumbled on a devise – the “O’Tom Tick Twister”. I ordered this (my first devices were shipped directly from France). I have since used this method exclusively (if the tick is still alive) because if you twist a tick out, the tick almost always comes out alive. Steady pressure using forceps often ended up with leaving one of the three mouth parts in the wound (which then required additional extended picking to get the mouth fragments removed). These guidelines only apply for deer (or bear) ticks as wood (or dog) ticks have very soft mouth parts. They are extremely easy to remove as they can simply be grabbed and pulled out (and because these are larger, forceps aren’t really needed). I suspect that the only reason that the forceps method is still recommended is that many providers don't know the difference between the different ticks. The forceps method works well for wood ticks but is entirely unnecessary for the reasons stated above. The primary attachment for these ticks is a type of cement made by the tick. When they are removed, a thin film of cement and dead skin usually comes with them. Deer tick mouth parts have porcupine type quills which prevent them from being pulled out directly. Therefore I learned that if a mouth part is left after a removal, I could assume this was a deer tick bite. If the tick was already dead (meaning there were retained mouth parts, my favorite way of treating this was to use a needle into the epidermis just under the mouth parts to lift them out of the skin. Forceps could then be used to remove the mouth parts. Done correctly, this method often didn't bleed. Another problem with using the forceps method alone is that once splinter forceps have been used for a few times, the slender metal tips tend to bend rendering the forceps useless. In my practice I often inject a small amount of anesthetic to further elevate the mouth parts and to make any additional probing painless. I have heard of some local physicians automatically using 2mm punch biopsies to cut out a small section of skin along with the tick. While this eliminates the problem of retained mouth parts, it causes a small scar and is much more expensive for a patient. 
Another item which I have learned but is not in the common literature is that after someone has been bitten several times, they can develop an allergy to the tick saliva. I have developed this delayed hypersensitivity (similar to poison ivy). As a result, I can almost always detect a tick within several hours after it bites. I also know that in two days I will scratch it raw because of how itchy it becomes. As a result, when I get bit by a deer tick, I don’t worry about antibiotics but rather immediately reach for hydrocortisone and start applying it immediately (I know this is only a low-potency cream, but because of the break in the skin, it seems to work without having to use prescription cortisone creams). These bite reactions are usually less than a centimeter in size but can occasionally have a target pattern. This is not Lyme disease! The State of Wisconsin does now allow me to diagnose Lyme based on the rash unless the rash is at least 5 cm (2 inches) across.  I have read very little in the literature about this common phenomenon of bite reactions. I don’t mind having this hypersensitivity as I feel I am now less likely to get reinfected with Lyme as a tick is not likely to be on my skin for more than 24 hrs. Unfortunately, this also means that visitors to trails (like AT hikers) are more likely to contract Lyme disease than locals, as the visitors have not had the chance to develop this sensitivity.  By the time they do develop this sensitivity, their thru-hike may be over. Some people also develop infections after tick bites. Because this is usually epidermal redness (bright red), it is probably not Lyme Disease, but is simply caused by an infection introduced through a break in the skin (as ticks don't live in the most sterile environments). These infections still usually need to be treated (and doxycycline still works well in this setting). This may happen often for AT hikers whose hygiene may be suspect so I would remind them to carefully wash any bites with soap and water (hand sanitizer will usually burn and can damage the skin underneath). 
I also experimented with different repellents or other tick avoidance strategies. Wearing my socks outside my pants made it easier to find ticks but didn’t dramatically decrease the number of bites. I learned that after a tick grabbed on to my clothing or shoes, it would move around only until it was able to find an area to hang on to. After that, it stopped moving entirely until it thought the host was asleep at which point it would move around the skin looking for a place to bite. Often when I sat down for dinner, I could feel Wood ticks start to climb up my legs. Bites were mostly likely to occur in areas where further motion was restricted such as elastic bands on undergarments, or hairline edges on scalps. My  usual pattern after I had been in the woods was to pick off all the ticks I could find. I found the best thing to do was then to immediately remove all my clothing and leave it in a pile in a spare bedroom. I would then return periodically and usually found several more ticks around the upper edge of shoes or other clothes. I know this will not be practical for most hikers. I found that DEET products tended to be useless for preventing tick bites.  I have even seen one study which suggested that 99% of deer ticks remained active after exposure to DEET.  Skin-so-Soft (supplied by my mother-in-law who was an Avon distributor was also worthless (and this didn’t even work against mosquitoes). However, around a decade ago, I learned about permethrin. I now try to never go out in the woods without treating my clothes with permethrin. This product stays effective for up to 6 washes (or 42 days). During any Boy Scout Campouts, I would spray the pants, socks and shoes of my scouts and found that I rarely had to ever take out a tick. I will definitely use this to treat my clothes and gear on the Appalachian this coming spring. I have had some luck with picaridin but because this is usually applied to bare skin, it is not as useful (although I may still bring a small bottle of this as it may work even better than DEET for mosquitoes).  Unfortunately, this product also tends to get washed off quickly by sweat in my experience (so I will be hiking in long pants and probably a head net during buggy periods on the trail. I can usually hike faster than most mosquitoes can fly, but I cannot outrun deer flies (which tend to be the worst offenders in my area).  
This post is getting quite long already. I will make another one about the tick borne diseases.",,View Entry,"Jan 21, Sun",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582615,"During the last post, I described how I deal with ticks. Ticks are obviously blood-sucking parasites, but what scares most people most about them are the diseases they spread. This post will describe my personal experience diagnosing and treating many patients with the most common tick-borne diseases. As with tick bites, there are many medical myths surrounding these diseases. I am also a bit ashamed how modern medicine permits medical fallacies to persist. The following is not meant to be a textbook and some of this is simply my personal opinion about how I approach these diseases. I hope to mitigate fear of these diseases and encourage people to get out into the woods. 
I will start with Anaplasmosis. This disease was formerly called Human Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis. I decided to start with this one because there is still a lot of misinformation about this disease. I also hope to gain credibility for the later section of this post by describing how this disease gave me my five minutes of fame. I was fortunate to be directly involved with the care of the world’s first two positive blood cultures of this disease. I had previously collaborated with the study’s lead author during some research on Lyme Disease. This scientist came up with the idea to use leukemia tissue cell cultures as a medium to culture this disease. It worked wonderfully and quickly. We were able to beat New York Medical College by several months. As a result, I was listed as third author for the lead article in an issue of the New England Journal of Medicine (probably the top medical journal in the world). Whenever I mention this to academic physicians, they are all impressed (particularly at research institutions where the mantra “publish or perish” rings true). I do have to say that I had very little to do with the actual science except to identify patients. I know that the University of Minnesota investigators were very interested in getting specimens. While we had made arrangements to have samples sent down by next day mail (a big deal back in the early 1990’s), they were so excited to get a specimen that they sent a graduate student to drive directly up to us rather than wait until the next day. The first patient was the father of one of my partners. (I can mention these specifics because there were several articles in local newspapers including the Minneapolis Star Tribune disclosing their names after the NEJM article came out. The second patient was much sicker and got a spinal tap and a CT scan but we managed her locally and she quickly recovered. It is rare for us to transfer a tick-borne disease to the Twin Cities (where my usual referral hospitals are) or for any family doctor after they have learned about this disease. As a result, I can state with some certainty that I have seen more cases (2-5/year x20 years) than the vast majority of infectious disease specialists). This disease actually makes patients the sickest. When it was first described, it was stated that 5% of patients would die from this disease. The essential elements of the diagnosis involve low white blood cell and platelet counts (often with elevated liver enzymes) in the setting of a significant fever. In the past, I would have called this a viral illness. After the disease was first described by a Duluth physician, I realized that I had been seeing it all along. Most young healthy people got better on their own without antibiotics. The sicker patients would usually be in the hospital for a while until someone lucked on an antibiotic which covered this disease. Doxycycline will cover this disease (as will flouoquinolones and rifampin but hardly any other antibiotics). However, older patients and anyone with a compromised immune system are most at risk. There is no chronic form of this (either you get better or you die) and it appears you can only get this disease once in your lifetime in most circumstances. I usually find that people recover amazingly quickly from this disease – often being able to be discharged from the hospital the day after appropriate antibiotics are started). 
Babesiosis is another relatively rare disease. I have only had a handful of patient with this. Again, if you are reasonably healthy, you can recover from this without antibiotics. For older patients or people with compromised immune systems, antibiotics are available but the recovery for my patients has been slow. The disease tends to resemble malaria, I had one patient who had the highest bilirubin (the yellow pigment which causes jaundice) I have ever seen. I have had one patient even need dialysis from this disease. It appears that this disease is spreading across Wisconsin. 
There are a few other rare diseases. Our area has had Ehrlichia chaffenensis and Ehrlichia muris (a disease which had never been identified in humans outside of Japan). Some of these diseases were identified when Mayo Clinic researchers came up to our area and sampled blood from some of our immunocompromised patients (particularly kidney transplant patients). There are some other diseases I have never treated so I won’t really discuss these. I did see one patient with Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever during my residency but have not seen a single case since then. I also have never seen Tick paralysis (an interesting syndrome where a patient becomes paralyzed but quickly gets better after the tick is removed. While our area has lots of ticks, we are too far north for some of these diseases to have spread. The CDC has recognized that tick numbers across wide sections of the US are increasing so the range of these diseases is also expanding. 
By far the tick-borne disease I see the most is Lyme Disease. I had learned about this disease back in New York as my medical school was just across Long Island Sound from where the disease had been first described in Connecticut. However, it was a rare disease out there. It seemed far more common out here. My daughter (who rarely goes outside) came down with it when we were on a combined work and vacation trip. She came down with some neck pain and then a fever. When she developed several large red splotches, we went to a doctor to get some antibiotics. I was then encouraged by the course director to bring her down as most of the participants had never seen a true Lyme rash before. I have had Lyme myself (diagnosed with a rash). While you can make the diagnosis by just the rash, the great majority of Lyme rashes don’t have the central clearing associated with a bull’s eye. The biggest clue for this rash is that it tends to be in the dermal layer (one layer lower than the epidermal layer seen for many other rashes). As a result, the rash is not as bright red as other rashes or simple cellulitis (which can also occur from tick bites). Low grade fevers are common but if I see a very high fever (e.g. 103) those patients usually have Anaplasmosis (and the sickest patients often have both diseases at the same time). While the blood test can be iffy for the first month, if you have been ill for six weeks of more, the blood test approaches 100% sensitivity (meaning that if you do not have a positive blood test, you do not have Lyme). The blood test is similar to testing for HIV – a positive antibody test is confirmed with a Western Blot test. 
The controversy (and the fear) about tick-borne diseases largely has to do with Chronic Lyme Disease. After my more than 25 years of treating this, I now feel that if you don’t improve after being treated with appropriate antibiotics, you probably never had Lyme Disease. The typical patient with “Chronic Lyme” is usually between 25-60 years of age. This is not the age that would be expected for chronic infections. Children are in the woods more often yet and have immature immune systems yet they rarely develop chronic Lyme. Older patients have poor immune systems but they rarely get chronic Lyme disease either. Chronic Lyme Disease resembles (and is probably only a variant of) fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is the most common cause of achiness in patients who feel ill enough to go to see a rheumatologist. It is clearly exacerbated by stress. The personality type of patients who get Chronic Lyme is such that they never blame themselves when they become ill (internal locus of control). Instead they have to blame something else (external locus of control).  I do my best to treat these patients and still prescribe antibiotics (including IV medications) until I am satisfied that the Lyme was adequately treated (as a lot of people in our area have positive antibodies and sometimes these antibodies will last forever). However, antidepressants or anticonvulsants (often used from chronic pain or as mood stabilizers) are likely to be much more effective, but often will not be accepted by these patients.   Unfortunately, these patients will rarely accept that stress is making their condition worse. I am too direct to be able to lie to my patients. I feel sorry for the Chiropractic-like nature of most Lyme “experts” who feed into these patients deep internal need to have something to blame besides themselves for why they feel poorly rather than helping these patients confront the psychosomatic nature of their illness. I also tell my patients to not visit Lyme Disease support groups. The only people who frequent these websites are either extremely unlucky patients or are (more frequently) patients who have an axe to grind as they are determined to make sure that everyone knows that their problems were caused by something other than stress. I can assure you there is no great conspiracy among physicians intentionally trying to ignore the disability of these patients. However, the CDC seems to have stopped funding high quality Lyme disease research as I believe they recognize the psychosomatic nature of this condition. A primary reason for me to write this post is because I have heard several of these patients interviewed and can sense their mental anguish (which either caused or was caused by their illness) These people are not doing other people a great service as they only serve to spread fear. 
BTW, I know some physicians do not believe that fibromyalgia is a real disease. In my opinion, this is simply a normal variant (such as brown hair vs red hair). The majority of people with fibromyalgia don’t even know they have the disease. These are often the people you see jogging around your town. They don’t know that they have fibromyalgia. They only know they feel better when they exercise. However, if they stop exercising or go through a period of significant stress, they start aching and can get diagnosed. It is important for these patients to get active again. Physicians should be doing everything they can to maximize patient’s ability rather than enabling their disability. Chronic Low Back Pain is another disease which modern medicine has completely mismanaged as some recent studies show that 90% of this disease has nothing to do with discs, nerve impingement or spinal alignment. Rather, the pain seems to be caused by chronic muscular tightness caused by psychological stress. If physicians mismanage the disease, minor back flares will have symptom magnification (sometimes caused central sensitization) and then the stress levels only increase as patients fear they will live in pain forever. There is a difference between pain and suffering. I do my best to eliminate the suffering even though I may not be able to eliminate all their pain. 
There used to be a vaccine to help prevent Lyme. This seemed to work well in my experience. However, the pharmaceutical company was sued over aggressive marketing practices as well as depressed patients who felt the vaccine gave them Lyme disease. Rather than fight these claims, the vaccine was taken off the market. I actually got a booster when I heard the vaccine was being recalled. Essentially the same vaccine is still available for dogs and horses (primarily because it is so effective – and because dogs and horses rarely sue drug companies).  It is my hope that the vaccine becomes available for humans again as an orphan drug. 
Once again, I apologize if I have offended anyone. I know that chronic Lyme is a controversial topic. Most of my readers will be motivated to be prepared for every eventuality of life on the trail. While you may get ill on the trail, a short course of antibiotics may be necessary. However, do not run for antibiotics. Some of the reported cases of “rotovirus” are actually cases of antibiotic related diarrhea as I have heard of other hikers who have a personal supply of doxycycline given to them by their well-intentioned but clueless personal physicians (who want to appear knowledgeable but don’t understand the disease or the harm of overprescribing antibiotics which should rarely be used by anyone between the ages of 3 and 70 except in very limited situations).  I know that many long-distance hikers don’t manage stress well (e.g. look at how many of them use marijuana, cigarettes or excessive alcohol). These are all unhealthy ways to deal with stress. These people may be at higher risk for “chronic Lyme” as they don’t tend to handle stress well. 
My wish is for AT hikers to take precautions to prevent getting tick bites and get early treatment if they become significantly ill. However, with products like permethrin practically everyone can have a safe and enjoyable trek. Chronic Lyme should not be on anyone’s list of greatest fears.

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582655,"I had to go to my yearly family medicine refresher course. Similar to last year, I drove to Milwaukee to attend the course sponsored by the Medical College of Wisconsin. While the course was full days on Wednesday and Thursday, because it was only a half day on Friday, I decided to do some hiking. I was limited on options for a refresher course this year. Many of the usual courses I would have attended are going to occur during my time on the trail. I still need to maintain my license so getting in some continuing medical education before I left made sense. 
On the Tuesday heading down here, I attended the 2018 Doctor Day at the Wisconsin State Capitol. Nearly 500 physicians and medical students attended. Governor Walker came and gave a speech to us. I then visited the offices of my state senator and state representative and discussed the four issues we had been educated about in the morning. This seemed to be a good idea (particularly because I was the only constituent from both districts (as I had to drive five hours to attend). On Tuesday afternoon, I was able to do a short 1-mile hike on the Ice Age Trail near Whitewater. 
There was hardly any snow in southern Wisconsin (compared to the six+ inches we still have). However, it was still nippy. While it had warmed up (particularly on Thursday) into the 30’s, Friday dawned bright and clear but temperatures were only in the single digits. After my course ended and I drove to the trailhead, it was only 11 degrees when I set out and 14 degrees when I returned to my car. 
I headed out. I quickly had to put on my trail cleats as there were some moderately long icy sections (particularly on north facing slopes). The trail was well marked and I walked 10 miles (5 miles there and back). The area was fairly picturesque walking along the Oconomowoc river (which was frozen) and then walking on the edges of several rehabilitated prairies. On the ridgetops, there were some very nice views. This segment did have two road walks but they were brief (0.4 and 0.2 miles) and on quiet roads. I turned on Audible and I started another Michael Crichton book, “In Case of Need” which he had published under another name before he became famous. This helped the time go by quickly. Except for some minor toe pain, it felt great to be out in the woods again. 
I was amazed at how quickly I walked. Even at the end, I was consistently hiking between 18-20 minutes/mile (including stops and walking slowly on icy sections). I know I have been quite religious about hitting the treadmill recently and it showed itself. While I was stiff whenever I stopped on the six-hour drive back home, even the next day I didn’t feel too badly.  However, this section of the trail was relatively flat as I only scaled the equivalent of 103 flights of stairs during the 10+ mile hike.  

Besides getting in some hiking, I was experimenting with my cold weather setup. I went out today wearing a hat, my buff (worn around my neck), long pants (with lightweight leggings (which was initially intended for my sleep system. I also had two pairs of socks (including using CoolMax liner socks (which I was going to experiment with but I didn’t end up liking these). For my torso, I only had a long-sleeved Merino wool shirt (the one my wife gave to me for Christmas), my new Outdoor Research Helium HD rain jacket (quite thin and much lighter than my old Alps Mountaineering rain jacket), and a lightweight puffy jacket. Rather than using my Ghost Whisperer Jacket, I received a Marmot Featherless Hoody in the fall Cairn Obsidian collection. While this is a few ounces heavier than the Ghost Whisperer, I am concerned about all the rain and humidity on the AT and like the idea of a synthetic system. 
This system worked quite well. It layered fairly comfortably (even when I wanted to wear the hoods of both the puffy and the rain jacket together). Except for some mild chilliness of my hands (which were covered with Z-Packs Possom Down gloves), I was surprised that I was able to keep quite warm. In fact, I was probably too warm. Towards the end I started to get a bit chilly. I then realized that I had been working up a good sweat and my lower layer was soaked (even to the point that my rain jacket was moist on both sides making my outer puffy somewhat damp as well). This was a good experiment and goes to show that a rain jacket can be an essential part of a cold weather gear system. I’m still a bit concerned about what I am supposed to do if there is a cold rain falling (but at least the temperature would be about 20 degrees warmer). I will also make sure that I keep myself better ventilated. 

Also when I was out in Milwakuee, I visited a REI and picked up a new pair of Trail Runners. My last pair were the Keen Voyageurs. However, this model has been discontinued. Instead, I picked up Keen Varghees. These seemed similar. Now that this pair is on file at REI, I should be able to get a replacement pair easily on the trail. I also got a new pair of Superfeet insoles and found out they now have a premium trail model (which I purchased). I also found some Injinji Trail socks which I also want to experiment with. While I usually like to hike with Injinji socks, if I do get a blister, I find I cannot get my socks on when the blisters are coated with Leukotape. I’ll probably take a few extra socks to be prepared to experiment during the first several weeks on the trail. While at REI, I also purchased some trail meals (as I really like the prepared meals rather than using instant potatoes or ramen) and I am prepared to pay the extra cost if it gives me comfort and better nutrition. I don’t plan to have too many mail drops, but I will have several (to also send some better snacks as I don’t want to only have snickers and other candy while out on the trail). I found out that my REI dividend won’t come out until the middle of March so it may be too late to purchase any last-minute gear using this. 
When I got home, I also found my 2018 AT AWOL guide. However, I will have to send it back as they accidentally sent the northbound edition and I had ordered the southbound (as except for the first six weeks, everything else will be SOBO. I also got a few more stuff stacks from Zpacks. I should now actually gather my gear together and then try to line up a shakedown from an experienced AT hiker. 
I now have less than seven weeks of work left (including a week of vacation in Arizona during which I hope to get my trail legs ready several weeks prior to setting out on the Appalachian). It is starting to get real.",,View Entry,"Feb 03, Sat",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582770,"I recently listened to the “Returning to Katahdin” podcast http://returningtokatahdin.lib... in which Bruce Matson listed songs which would be recommended for a thru-hike. For this post, I decided to list some of my own. 
I will start with the oldest selection on this list. “Here Comes the Sun” by the Beatles .  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgWh-tjxv3I    Lyrics such as “Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear, Here comes the sun, and I say It's all right” will remind me to never quit on a bad day. 
My second song is far less well known. However, it has some of the best lyrics for a long hike. “But Not Tonight” by Depeche Mode. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrzPAiKEu6s    Lyrics such as “Oh God, it’s raining, but I’m not complaining. It’s filling me up with New Life”, “I haven’t felt so alive in years” and “The wind in my hair Makes me so aware How good it is to live Tonight”, and “Oh God, it's raining And I'm not containing My pleasure at being So wet”  would be great to listen to during stretches of bad weather.  

Another weather related song is “Here Comes the Rain Again” by the Eurythmics https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzFnYcIqj6I   Lyrics like “Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion, I want to walk in the open wind” may also help to deal with meteorological adversity.  I know that nearly every day I am checking out a website watching snow-pack levels along the Appalachian Trail. This snow and future rains will hopefully ensure that I have abundant great-tasting water to consume. 
Have you noticed how many weather related songs are on this list? Perhaps this is one of my fears.  This next song gets back to some of my motivation for making the hike in the first place.  “I Melt with You” by Modern English. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxJVZPYEpk0 I particularly liked the line. “I made a pilgrimage to save this humans race” as many times during the past year, I have simply wanted to leave and see how the trail changes me. However, I hope I can ignore the next verse “Never comprehending the race has long gone by”....   

Switching a bit away from 80’s New Wave Music, here’s something much more top 40 (but still in the 1980’s): ”Holiday” by Madonna  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Rswx2Z7SDw  I know that there will be hard times ahead on the trail but I can’t seem to forget that I am somewhat approaching this trip as a Holiday. When the hardships do come, I need to remember “It's time for the good times
Forget about the bad times”.  

To switch musical styles and to show that there are other outdoor themes, I also like this song: “Have You Ever” by Brandi Carlisle. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkxyT27xRH0   It was featured on a podcast related to being a Scoutmaster for the Boy Scouts and I learned to appreciate the song more since then. Lyrics such as “Have you ever wandered lonely through the woods? And everything there feels just as it should, You're part of the life there, You're part of something good” remind me to make the most of my upcoming experiences.  


My next song for this list is the most modern. It was sung live at the welcoming home ceremony after finishing our trek at Philmont: “I’m Gonna Be (500 miles)” by the Proclaimers.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbNlMtqrYS0   This seems like a great song for a thru-hike. Remembering my experience at Philmont has only made the song more special (even though I was proud of finishing only 91 miles).  This stanza seems to be the most relevant. “And when I'm dreaming, well I know I'm gonna dream I'm gonna dream about the time when I'm with you When I go out, well I know I'm gonna be I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you
And when I come home, yes I know I'm gonna be I'm gonna be the man who's coming home with you. But I would walk 500 miles And I would walk 500 more Just to be the man who walks a thousand miles To fall down at your door"". Perhaps I like this song as a tribute to my wife whom I will miss while I am on the trail. This will be by far the longest I have been away from her and I truly appreciate that she has given me permission to do this hike. 
While most of this list is clearly related to hiking, my final song is related to my concern about turning old (i.e. turning 20,000 days old and finishing my middle third of my life on the first night on the trail as described in a prior post). It is also one of my long-term favorites. “Forever Young” by Alphaville. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1TcDHrkQYg   Here are some of the relevant lyrics: “Can you imagine when this race is won, Turn our golden faces into the sun. It's so hard to get old without a cause. I don't want to perish like a fading horse. Youth's like diamonds in the sun, And diamonds are forever, So many adventures given up today, So many songs we forgot to play, So many dreams swinging out of the blue, Oh let it come true. I want to be forever young”. With this hike, I am not longer giving up adventures. I am obviously also hoping that this thru-hike will help me figure out how to make the rest of my life more meaningful.  

“So Many Songs We Forgot to Play”. Do you like this list? I apologize if the musical genres are a bit restricted but I appreciated the mental exercise to gather my own list. I hope that I am approaching this thru-hike in a thoughtful manner to allow the most personal growth. Music may help this process.",,View Entry,"Feb 08, Thu",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583666,"I’ve been relatively silent on these boards for a while. Part of this is because I’ve been busy trying to get everything done before I go. I have also been amazed at all the new bloggers (many of whom have already started the trail). Whereas I used to be able to read every entry from everyone starting in 2018, at this point, I simply don’t have the time to keep up here (or on YouTube). It’s good to see that this forum is still relevant with all the new bloggers. Welcome to all! My favorite Youtube Vloggers this year are Scoutmaster on the AT (whose troop received medical care from my unit during last year's National Scout Jamboree) and IntrepiDan (although I am a bit concerned that his creativeness might be related to some mood-altering substances as on at least one occasion he had pinpoint pupils (which can suggest narcotic usage)). 
Things have started to get real. Last week, the local hospital sent out a letter informing my patients that I would not be available this summer. I tried to not send a letter like this, but after our clinic manager consulted a Rural Health Clinic specialist, they recommended sending out the notification letter. As a result, work has been much busier and I believe my schedule is now full until I leave. I read something from one of the bloggers for the Trek which I definitely related to. She feels like she is sitting in a rear-facing seat on a speeding train. While I will eventually get someplace, at this point, I can only really see what I am leaving behind.  I have also been moving furniture (as we will be replacing the carpet in our great room and stairs) and trying to get my taxes done. I also had my last checkup (getting my eyes checked with a new backup of pair of glasses ready for emergencies). 
I finally started to gather up all my gear. I still have some questions, but at this point, except for the biggest question about how much food do I want to bring to start, I have most of what I need. I brought in my full pack to the local Rotary Club as I was asked to speak about both finishing up the Superior Hiking Trail as well as this upcoming Appalachian Trail. I got lots of questions which usually indicates that people were interested in my talk. I was also asked to be a trail correspondent for the local on-line news service but I have declined so far as I don’t really want to draw attention to myself (particularly considering the odds are so high that I will not finish). I was able to fix the metal stay issue with my ULA Ohm 2.0 backpack and have decided that this will be the backpack I will start out with (as it is far more comfortable than some of my other backpacks (Z-packs Arc-Blast and Osprey Atmos). 
I’ve been doing what I can to work out. Fear is a great motivator! I have been averaging about 14,000 steps a day on my treadmill since the first of the year. I have been participating in Bigfoot and Viking’s Million Step Challenge. The goal is to walk a million steps before March 31st. I just passed 900,000 steps today so I have four weeks to get the last 100,000 steps. Unfortunately, the outside weather this year has been awful. Between early December and last week, my home town had been above freezing for about 18 hours total. Two weeks ago, we received more than a foot of snow (in three different storms) and then it finally started to thaw. We had about 4 consecutive days with temperatures in the 40’s and our road almost thawed out (as it is usually snow covered for most of the winter). However, as of tonight, another winter storm was dumping another 8 inches of snow on my town. My hopes of an early spring letting me do some actual hiking are likely dashed. 
However, I had prepared for this possibility. I decided to take a final week of vacation this week and travel to my wife’s sister’s (and brother-in-law’s) place in Mesa, AZ to get in some real backpacking. I got a redeye flight on Friday night and then was out driving to a trailhead around sunrise the next day.  I decided to initially try to hike part of the Arizona Trail. I even purchased the Guthook App so I can gain some experience using the features of this application.  I figured that I would push myself this week to hopefully develop some of my trail leg muscles (figuring that I would then have two weeks of recuperation before I would hit the actual Appalachian Trail if I did sustain an injury). My sister-in-law wanted to go to the Arizona Renaissance Festival on the first Sunday so my first day out, I pushed myself a bit more than I would have ordinarily. I walked more than 38,000 steps and climbed the equivalent of 200 flights of stairs. The trail was rocky but not excessively steep. I listened to the latest posthumous Michael Crichton novel “Dragon Teeth” which was quite enjoyable. It was great hiking weather with highs expected to be generally in the high 70’s to low 80’s without any risk of rain for the entire week. 
Two days later, I pushed myself again. I had planned to hike between 25-30,000 steps. I found a steeper mountain in the Superstitions east of Phoenix. I then had an extended climb with some great views. I then started walking down the opposite side of the mountain. Here I had my first fall. While the fall itself wasn’t particularly dangerous, it was definitely memorable. While descending, I had some gravel slip out underneath my shoes. I tried to catch myself with my poles but ended up falling on my rear end. Unfortunately, I had rolled directly into a Prickly-Pear Cactus. I had never had this happen to me before. According to Endomondo, that mile of the trail took 1 hr and 53 minutes. Unfortunately, while the trail was moderately traveled on the front side of the mountain, not a single hiker came along to help pick out needles. Eventually, I started hiking again. Surprisingly I did fairly well. I ended up walking more than 20,000 steps after the fall (ending up with over 28,000 for the day). When I got home, my sister in law used some Nair on the areas which I could not reach. Getting rid of my body hair in these areas made it far easier to find the spines. Hopefully being stubborn enough to persist in spite of this (which is not expected to be a hazard on the Appalachian Trail) will translate in a higher likelihood that I do finish the trail. I hope to do over 25,000 steps with a full pack each day (and will probably do at least one overnight camping when my sister-in-law has to work her own job). I know the muscle soreness I have been feeling shows that I have been using muscles I don’t routinely use on the treadmill. 
My name was mentioned in last week’s Mighty Blue podcast (as the secondary guest (who has been creating some high-resolution intricate maps of the Superior Hiking Trail) had reached out to the host after I had posted the link on the Superior Hiking Trail Facebook page). I have a feeling that my name will be mentioned again this coming week as the topic of the last DocSpot is post-trail depression and my post about this topic was one of the longest. I will have to figure out how to listen to this podcast (as well as Bruce Madson’s “Returning to Katahdin” sister podcast when I am out on the trail. 
Only 23 days left before I head out! I still can’t believe after planning this for over five years (and counting down the date for more than two), the trip is nearly here! I’m getting more and more excited (and sometimes scared). I also find myself becoming much more emotional than usual (as this is not one of my core attributes).  Hopefully the trek will be valuable for me.",,View Entry,"Mar 05, Mon",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584543,"I started this post in the Phoenix airport returning home. Making this trip was a great idea. I was able to get in hiking nearly every day (except for the first Sunday). I hiked with my full backpack multiple different trails and climbed the equivalent of at least 100 flights of stairs every time on the trail. Particularly because home received 9 inches of snow (prompting consecutive snow days), I would not have been able to get in training like this closer to home. 
I’ve already described my encounter with the prickly pear cactus. That night, I woke up every time I rolled to my right. I noticed periodic jabs of pain thereafter but this largely healed within 2 days. My general plan was to attempt to hike over 30,000 steps one day and then about 20,000 steps the next. The first several evenings, I would return to my sister-in-law’s home and we would go out to dinner. I had some nice margaritas and Mexican food on two nights and had a delightful shrimp dinner one evening on another night.  In the evenings, I was introduced to the Netflix show “Stranger Things” which I binge-watched eventually finishing both of the first two seasons. 
The highlight of my trip was a three day, two night backpacking trip to the Arizona Trail around the town of Roosevelt, AZ. There is a large lake formed by a dam. The trail in this area climbs more than 4000 feet. I initially drove to the first trailhead west of the lake. This winding gravel road was a challenge to itself but I was able to make it to the top and parked my vehicle. That first night, I headed west and headed further up the trail. This extended climb appears to be perfect training for my future hikes. While I didn’t have as many clothes as I will probably have on the AT, I was carrying far more weight as I carried around 7.5 liters of water (not wanting to run out as well as to ensure a good workout). This struggle uphill really emphasized the importance of a light pack. 
I climbed steadily upwards and cactuses gradually gave way to brush and even a few Ponderosa pines (although the majority of these seemed to have been burned years ago). Near the top, I started to run into small snowbanks along the edge of the trail when I would be hiking on the north side of a mountain. I was using Guthooks and had one of the moments I had read about when I checked the elevation profile after thinking I must have climbed nearly to the top of this mountain and my heart dropped when I saw that I still had another 1000 feet to climb. When I got to the top and it was starting to approach dusk, I started to search for a camping spot and eventually found one. I set up camp and ate dinner and had nearly all of my chores finished before I needed to even turn on my headlamp. 
I slept fitfully overnight. Having seen the snow, I had bundled up and even slept in my puffy jacket. However, during the middle of the night, I woke up in a sweat because I was too warm. Even the second night, I struggled to keep my top half warm while allowing my lower half to be cool enough to not sweat. I’m sure I will figure this out on the trail. In the morning, I made a quick breakfast of an everything bagel (brought back in Mesa) which was much better that simply having dried oatmeal. I also experimented with my first Starbucks Via instant coffee packets. Even eating these dry, the taste was far better than the Taster’s Choice instant coffee packets I usually eat dry every morning before I have the rest of my breakfast and typically about a liter of water.  I may eventually try to stop having any coffee on the AT, but I will start out carrying some instant packets. 
I then headed out. I had selected a different genre from Audible for my listening pleasure. Because I had gotten it for a special price and I had seen that PBS had made a series based on the book, I listened to “Call the Midwife”. I enjoyed this. The author talked about the deplorable conditions associated with childbirth before midwifery developed. Towards the end of the book, most babies had started to be born in hospitals. I have personally delivered over 400 babies in our little town so I understood much of the obstetrical dilemmas she faced. I also supervised a midwife. Once we hired out midwife, my obstetrical practice withered. These days it seems that women simply prefer to have a woman provider and there was simply nothing I could do about this (short of a sex change which I doubt would have been effective). Our hospital recently stopped delivering babies completely after nearly all our obstetrical nurses left for higher salaries at a hospital to our south (which had had their nurses raided by a hospital closer to the Twin Cities). I had been contemplating stopping obstetrics anyway as it has been hard to keep my skills current when I wasn’t delivering many babies. The great majority of my obstetrics over the past several years had been high risk (as our midwife would only call me in when she was struggling herself) or when a woman presented to our hospital in labor who had not had any prenatal care (usually because she was using methamphetamine). On this second day of the trip, I headed back to my car and then continued all the way down to the bridge and then back up the hill until I got to a decent campsite. I walked over 31,000 steps this day. This was a very hard day for me. I did run into two Arizona Trail thru-hikers early on (one of whom said that the Arizona Trail was harder than the Appalachian Trail). When I got to my final campsite, I set up camp and started to make dinner. Unfortunately, I was in a somewhat exposed area and a heavy wind had developed. I found a cluster of rocks to cook in. This was a good site to limit fire danger, and I managed to boil my water quickly. I had downsized my cookpot to a 600ml titanium stove (which I found was the perfect size to have a small butane gas canister fit inside). However, the new cook pot seemed to be too small for my pocket rocket. I had experimented with a BRS ultralight stove the night before (which was a few ounces lighter and had a built in igniter). Several times while cooking, my cookstove partially fell off my pocket rocket. I then was able to extinguish the flame and using my buff, lifted up the boiling water to pour into my prepared meal. Unfortunately, because of my fatigue and lack of space, I had situated the bag on my leg (to prevent it from blowing over). I realized my mistake as the water started to hit the bottom of the bag. I was unable to lift up the bag immediately and then reflexively, my leg jumped after I felt the searing pain. Most of meal dropped to the ground. While I only had superficial first degree burns on my right thigh and my left thumb, because I was wearing Crocs, there was an area where the boiling water hit my right foot and pooled there. I developed a moderate blister there nearly immediately. I was able to rescue a little bit of supper. Fortunately I had plenty of extra food (as training weight), but now I had to worry about scavengers bothering my campsite (and a dayhiker had said that he had seen a family of javelinas around the area that I had been hiking through).  This was one of the worst days I have ever encountered on the trail. I was somewhat discouraged and hoped I would be able to hike back to my car with my wounded foot. 
At around that exact moment after I had cleaned everything up, another thru-hiker came by. “Stone” was hiking the Arizona trail as he was already a triple-crowner (finishing up the CDT last year). We talked for a while that night and I gave him some of my extra food (as he had arrived too late at the small store at the RV campground at the base of the mountain). After talking for a long time, he went further up the hill in search of another campsite. 
In the morning, I tried to get an early start. I actually hoped to catch up with Stone. Stone had also gotten out of camp quite early. I passed two potential campsites until I finally saw him far ahead of me (probably about a mile). I was able to hike quite quickly that day. My first mile took 22 minutes and then next two only took 18 minutes each. I was actually able to catch up with Stone and we walked up to my car together. I asked him lots of questions and I hope that Stone appreciated the company as he said that he had only camped with another camper one night over the several hundred miles he had already hiked on this trail. He wears a kilt. He has learned to travel quite cheaply and rarely uses hotels or hostels to save money. He mentioned that if I wanted to avoid the party crowd, I should stay away from hostels which are donation based. When we reached my car, he sat inside and we talked a bit longer. I gave him $20 (I don’t tend to carry a lot of cash when I am hiking) for putting up with all my questions and to help him out. He seemed quite gracious to answer everything he could as honestly as he could). He is also a bit concerned about my taking three weeks off in the middle of the trail as this may be a long enough break to start to lose my trail legs. 
Overall, this was a great week to prepare for the Appalachian.  I definitely noticed my legs were challenged by the week, but by the time I returned to the snow, I felt I had started to develop my trail legs. I found I was able to walk downhill nearly as quickly as walking on flat ground as I had initially been quite tentative walking downhill (particularly after I fell into that cactus earlier in the week).  I had been challenged physically and had to deal with two minor injuries (the cactus and the burn). I actually believe I started some of the mental game I will have to deal with on the trail. 
My first day at work also had a milestone. I did a 24 hour shift in the Emergency Room which completed my final ER responsibilities until after I finish the Appalachian (as I will not do any overnight ER shifts when I return home in May). The ER nurses seemed upset that I would not be working with them any longer but were genuinely enthusiastic for my success. I even received several facebook friend requests from some of them. (While I don’t post on Facebook much, I did make several posts last week about hiking on the Arizona Trail as well as posting a picture of my shirt caked in salt from my evaporated perspiration. My wife also made several posts about the cactus and my burn!??!).  It really feels odd to be completely finished with this responsibility as I still can’t grasp that this long awaited hike is about to become a reality.  I then attended my last Board of Health meeting and saw some patients at out of town nursing homes (whom I will see again in May before handing off their care to others for the remaining of my trek). 
I’ve started to soak my feet in vinegar nightly to both toughen up the skin (to help prevent blisters) as well as to decrease the low grade athlete’s foot I have (after reading about this in the book “Fixing your Feet”. I also was surprised this week to receive my orange thru-hiker backpack tag as they decided to mail these to people who were not starting in Georgia, Maine, or Harper’s Ferry. 

I have been extremely busy trying to get everything finished prior to heading out. In addition to getting my own gear in order and finishing up with all my work responsibilities, I have been trying to clean up my office (as I know that temporary providers will be using my office while I am away). We also had new carpet installed in our home (after 20 years of use) so several evenings were spent moving furniture. I also completed my taxes today. I’ve also scheduled a meeting with Bigfoot who will give my gear a final shakedown this coming weekend (when I have to go down to the Twin Cities to see my son awarded one of the Northern Star Council Eagle Scout scholarships). I don’t think I will really be able to relax until I actually get on the trail! I only have three days of work left and then my wife and I will head off to drive to Atkins, VA. We will spend one afternoon at the Lincoln Library in Springfield, IL on the way down there. After counting down for so long, it is hard to fathom that I will be leaving work and my family for such a long time. This pipe dream is actually going to happen!",,View Entry,"Mar 21, Wed",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585116,"I’m on the way to the trail! :)Ten years ago, I made the decision to do something big this summer. I have been counting down the months since then. About six years ago, I decided I wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail. About 760 days ago, I finalized the date. After nearly seeming like a pipe dream for so long, it feels so strange to be actually making my final preparations.  This hike will actually happen! It’s been hard getting my mind around such a concept. 
Last Friday I had my last day at work. Since I returned to Arizona, nearly all my patients have been aware and had generally been supportive (although several expressed misgivings about their own health while I am gone). I did my best to assuage my guilt that someone else could look after them. On my Clifton Strengths Finder, I know that one of my strengths is responsibility. This essentially translates into meaning that if I promise to do something, I will do everything possible to ensure the promise is fulfilled. One of the local Strengths Finder coaches figured this strength is why I stayed well past my original three year commitment with the National Health Service Corps. Shortly before I arrived, our local hospital was really struggling. The hospital was at its debt limit and only had enough money in the bank for one payroll. There was even a vote to close the hospital (which failed by one vote). After I signed my contract, a local physician one year behind me still in residency agreed to come back to the area. With a nucleus of two young fully trained family physicians, we turned the hospital around. Within several years, the entire debt had been paid off and we embarked on the first of two expansions and renovations of the old hospital. Many statistics related to health dramatically improved during the 27 years I have been in this small town. From being one of the worst counties in Wisconsin for premature deaths, we have steadily improved so that during the last year for which we have data, Burnett County had achieved statistics better than the rest of the state and better than the surrounding counties in spite of the prediction (based largely on economic factors) that we would continue to have worse than average outcomes. I have always worried that if I were to leave, our local hospital might close. This is certainly a possibility but I do feel that the 10 year notification (which was announced to the former hospital administrator at that time) was one way I got around my sense of personal responsibility. I try to remind myself that everyone (including me) is replaceable. Over the years, many members of our staff have departed and we have always been able to survive. While I like to think that I tend to have higher standards, I finally get more time for myself. I still have no idea what I will be doing for work when I finish the trail. Hopefully I will find guidance along the way. 
The clinic staff had a small party for me on my last day. They had treats based on what they thought trail food would be like along with some gag gifts. Everyone seems convinced that I will hurt myself (as I have a history of church softball related injuries) and a large basket of first aid supplies was presented to me. While injuries are always a possibility, I feel I have prepared myself as well as I could for this trip and will be embarking in reasonably good shape.  My burn seems to have fully healed. I did finally lose one toenail due to the Arizona trip (which fell off tonight while I was typing this blog!). I have a few minor fissures on my toes due to soaking my feet frequently over the past 10 days in vinegar. I had read about this technique in the book “Fixing Your Feet” as a way to both toughen up skin prior to a long hike as well as to help prevent or treat any athlete’s foot fungus. These soaks removed a lot of dead skin off of my feet (and my callouses are much softer). I will withhold judgment after I see how my feet are holding up to several weeks of hiking. 
After pushing myself a bit in Arizona, I actually had the slowest activity week in several months, partially related to having meetings (hospital recruiting, Boy Scouts or medical) nearly every day. I also did my best to clean out a lot of the junk from my office which had accumulated since we moved in to the new clinic nearly 10 years ago.  Whenever the temperatures in the afternoon were above freezing, I also took a houseplant or two home. The office seemed bare as I left it for the last time until May. I even met the locum tenens nurse practitioner who will be covering my absence in the month of April. 
One gift which surprised me was a new Garmin Vivofit fitness tracker. I had been planning on bringing my FitBit One along as I have a long history of using my FitBit. However, a lightweight tracker which is waterproof and doesn’t require a battery was too much to pass up. I will initially have both trackers and will then decide if I eventually drop one. 
The following day, I had to drive to the Twin Cities. My son had been awarded one of the 25 Eagle Scout Scholarships (for $1,000) which was a nice honor considering our Council awarded the Eagle Rank to more than 700 Boy Scouts during the past year. This was a nice event and recalled the one in which I was awarded the Young American Award (Exploring’s highest award) back when I was a senior in high school myself. I will probably donate the prize money back over the next several years to the Boy Scouts as the recognition was far more important than the money. 
Before we went to the Council Boy Scout Recognition Dinner, I also was able to have a pack shakedown done by Bigfoot himself. This was extremely valuable as there were many items I had been torn about bringing and I eliminated several pounds worth of gear. I then spent the rest of the weekend finishing last minute chores (particularly cleaning up all my financial records, my home office and my hiking supplies (with a brief introduction about my organizational system to my wife in case she needs to send something out to me). My pack eventually weighed in at 32 pounds including 2 liters of water and more than 5 days’ worth of food. I have some nice culinary options which I had been saving for this event so I decided to bring them along as I am not sure if I will be able to get more than Ramen at some of the early stops. That probably means my base weight is less than 20 pounds which is where I was hoping to be. When I get rid of some cold weather gear, my pack weight will probably go even lower. I don’t think I forgot anything but I will probably remember something after I start hiking. 
My wife and I started our trek to Virginia on Monday. We had to stop at REI (partially to get some new shoes for her before she heads out to her own trip to Iceland during the summer (while my kids watch our place). My annual REI dividend is now completely spent. We made it to Peoria, IL on Monday night. On Tuesday, we traveled to Springfield and enjoyed a tour of the Lincoln Presidential Library.  The rest of that day we drove to just east of Nashville, TN.  On Wednesday, we will travel to Boone, NC to visit my nephew. His first faculty position is an appointment to the Department of Sociology at Appalachian State University. I know that I had planned to take a zero or two when I made it down to North Carolina, but when we saw that Boone was only 90 minutes away from Atkins, VA, we called him up and arranged the visit (as my wife wanted to see his place as well). I hope to be dropped off on the AT around 10 am and start my hike. Using Guthooks, I only plan to hike around 6 miles that first day to a nice stealth site along a stream. 
While I continue to be extremely excited as the final countdown ticks down to a few hours, I have generally still been sleeping fairly well. I have awoken a few times but nothing like many other writers have described. I’m glad to have the sleep and perhaps this bodes well that I will take to sleeping well on the trail as well. As I am sure any readers of this blog can attest, a lot of preparation has gone into this hike so I feel confident I am ready for the challenge.  
I’ve been now watching the 10 day weather forecast for Atkins. This town recently had two large snowfalls. The weather forecast has changed significantly since it was 10 days from being dropped off. At one point, the weather forecast called for an 80% chance of rain. As of tonight, the chances for rain has been significantly lowered and the forecasted high temperatures have increased (as a high in the low 70’s is now forecasted with no chance for freezing temperatures in the next 6 days). This will be a nice change of pace from our local weather as we’ve been having lows in the higher teens nearly every day the past week and Mother Nature deposited over an inch of snow the night before I left. I even walked onto the lake to get a picture on my last day at work (as there is still easily a foot of ice left as there hasn’t even been any melting along the shoreline yet). I was finally able to get our hanging Christmas icicle light decorations off the roof.  While I was doing this, I was able to reach the eaves without using a ladder from one of snow piles by the edge of our driveway. Spring seems to be in full force in Tennessee as there is lots of green grass and flowering trees here along the Interstate. I don’t believe that it will be as warm in Atkins but I know my town won’t get to have flowering trees until I return home in early May.  

I have been approaching the weather more inquisitively than I might have thought. I know that all my major transitions have been met by extremely fair weather (for college, medical school, residency and finally my current practice) in spite of these often not being my initial first choice (particularly for college and residency where Cornell and Iowa were definitely not my first choices). However, God seems to have steered me well. 
 However, I also remember my birthday when I turned 40. This was the only birthday that I have ever struggled with. At that time, I kept thinking that so many possibilities were closing to me. For the actual day, I merely wanted to be alone. I drove up to northern Canada (around the Dryden, Ontario area) north of International Falls, MN. I eventually drove off onto a logging trail and set off into the woods when I couldn’t drive any further. I backpacked to a lake and set up camp on the eve prior to my 40th. On my actual birthday, I awoke to rain. It rained and rained and rained and rained and rained and rained and rained……    Finally just before sunset, the rain tapered off and the sun appeared for a moment as it dipped below the clouds just before setting. I interpreted that as God telling me that there is still a little bit of sunshine left after 40. I drove back home the next day (which was beautiful) and have tried to make the most of the past 15 years. With these lessons, the weather doesn’t really matter but I still hope to have some sort of spiritual awakening as to my higher purpose as I embark on the final third of my life (hopefully, as my sister certainly didn’t get her allotment) of my life. 
My next post will be from the trail. It will probably be much shorter as I still haven’t figured out a nice dictation program and my cell phone typing skills using my thumbs are still primitive. I also tend to edit these posts moving my thoughts around (hopefully in a more logical fashion to make it easier for the reader to comprehend). I might even only post a few disorganized lines which I would try to flesh out later. I have been trying to reply to any messages sent to me. I will even meet one reader of this blog within the first several weeks. He has similar goals to embark on his own thru-hike when his children graduate. 
Wish me Luck!  My time has finally arrived! Hopefully any long term goals for my readers will also come true! Just keep planning and working towards that goal! It can come true!",,View Entry,"Mar 27, Tue",0

Last night neither I nor my wife slept well. I woke up ready to go. My nephew made a nice breakfast for us. After going through my pack for the last time, we said our goodbyes and drove off. The drive passed uneventfully, but I could tell my wife was going to be emotional when I said goodbye. We parked at the Barn Restaurant and started hiking. My wife decided to hike the first mile with me. We took some pictures and headed into the woods. The first mile went quickly. My wife started crying. I decided to laugh at her as she tends to tear up at goodbyes which got her a bit mad, but at least it stopped the crying. She watched me walk up the trail and then she was gone. 
The weather was glorious with temperatures in the low 70's and sunny weather. There was a little residual snow but overall the trail was delightful. There were generally fewer rocks and roots than on the Superior Hiking Trail. I struggled with some of the uphills but was still able to get my miles done under 30 minutes as I was excited to be on the trail. Initially I didn't listen to anything but then I turned on some music. With each song I was reminded of the people who have been left behind. One song would remind me of my wife and then the next song reminded me of my sister (as I remembered downloading that song when I visited her (before she died) after hearing it at an area attraction). 
My initial plan had been to only hike around 6 miles the first day. However this morning, I sheepishly realized that today was my 20000th day of life. With the anniversary combined with the fact that the weather will be turning worse, I decided to hike further. I had to make a flooded river crossing. 
I kept expecting to be passed by other hikers but I never saw another hiker until I decided to stay at a hostel for my first night. There were only two other hikers there, one from Connecticut and the other one was from the Czech republic. He had hurt his knee and I taped him up until he was able to get some rest and a better knee brace. Overall the hostel seems excellent with very friendly owners. They even gave me a free box of goodies which had been donated by an area church. For only $20, the place seemed to be a bargain. I really don't have much of an appetite yet, but I really enjoyed a few Diet Pepsi's. 
Overall the day was an excellent start for the trail. I'm looking forward to many more adventures. I feel good overall with only some minor foot pain. I am planning to hike around 11-12 miles tomorrow and stay in my first shelter.","Atkins, VA

The first night in the hostel was generally quite nice. The other hikers were friendly. The Czech hiker’s phone was malfunctioning and it's alarm went off in the middle of the night. I didn't sleep the best. In the morning, I had a breakfast of cold cereal and enjoyed several cups of fresh coffee. It had rained overnight so I set off when it looked like it had stopped raining. One hiker was going to the next hostel. Chex Mix (the Czech hiker) had initially planned to take a rest day but after a night’s rest and some ibuprofen, hopefully combined with my taping up of his knee, he decided to hike out today. He waited until he could settle the bill with the owners. Right away I had a significant hill followed by my first shelter. I signed my name but saw that hikers on consecutive nights had seen a bear cub. This was another nice day of hiking but it was much harder than the previous day. This was partially because it rained lightly most of the day but also because there were several tough climbs including one which was over 1800 ft. This is nearly twice as high as any of the hills on the Superior hiking trail. I finished up an audiobook called The Hike which I had started in Arizona.  This was more of a fantasy but it was still enjoyable. After last long climb I filtered water for the first time and made my way to the chestnut knob shelter. I decided to stay in the shelter. There were a few other hikers. One of them had actually brought up several cans of beer and he offered one to me. I shared some of my extra food including some champagne flavored gummy bears which hidden given to me as a gift. As the evening went along, the temperatures continue to fall and eventually the rain change to a combination of sleet and light snow. I Settled in for the night and received some advice from the other hikers.","Bear Garden Hostel

In the morning we realized that one of the hikers had left a bar in his shoe in the mouse had found it. When he woke up he threw the bar on the floor and it was relatively quiet the rest of the night. In the morning the three other hikers left at 5 a.m. planning to do some night hiking. In the morning I had my breakfast and was planning to set out quickly as I saw the terrain was favorable. When I put my boots on, I found the mouse had placed several portions of the bar from last night inside my boot. While it had gotten down into the high twenties overnight, the day was beautiful. I was again able to hike in a t-shirt. I ran into two southbounders. One of them was doing a flip flop from Pennsylvania. No one passed me at all. The terrain was generally rockier today. I had decided to read Gone With the Wind as I knew it was a classic which I had never read. My wife laughed at me when I said I had decided to read this book because I had thought that it had been set in Virginia, but found out that the story was based in Georgia. After 10 miles I had a choice of stopping or continuing for another 5 miles. Because I had seen on YouTube that the campsite 5 miles ahead was a very nice one and because it was a such a nice day I continued on. I was glad I did as I am being serenaded by a flowing river. I had a little bit of difficulty hanging my bear bag but eventually succeeded. Just before dark a party of four people arrived anf also camped near me. One of them was from Minneapolis and knew one of the school teachers from Grantsburg. At this point I have hiked 40 miles which is more than I had planned. I was generally feeling more sore (particularly in my calves) so I am planning for a lighter day tomorrow.","Chestnut Knob shelter

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585509,"I've started using Google Docs and have started to use the dictation function. Another day is in the books and I'm still loving the trail. Overnight I had my best night's sleep since I've started on the trail. It was mildly cold but stayed above freezing. I set out in the morning thinking I would do about 9 miles as my calves head been hurting me overnight. There was not a lot of water in this section. When I got to Helveys mill shelter, I debated about calling it a day. I had to walk down a steep slope to get water but after doing this and taking a reasonably long break it was still only three in the afternoon and I felt pretty good. So I started hiking again and hiked another 4 miles until a stealth camp on a ridge with good 4G internet. I ran into the couple from Minneapolis on the trail again today. They had gone into Bland for resupply and food. I had hoped for my first on trail hamburger but the one spot on trail was closed on Sunday. It was nice to cross Interstate 77. While it had started drizzling in the morning, it was generally dry but mildly nippy if I stopped hiking. I carried some wood shavings from a road to a shelter as these help the privy waste to break down faster. My wife made it safely home and we went through the past week's mail. The plan for tomorrow is to hike to at least Trent's grocery where I hope to get a hamburger. So far I have stayed at to stealth spots, one hostel, and one shelter. It seems so far that the hikers seem to prefer one of these. I'm not sure what I will be doing going forward.","Laurel Creek stealth campsite

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585646,"Overnight I had my best night of sleep on the trail so far. In the morning I set out and made it to the next shelter within several hours. At that location there was a family with a father and two sons who are just setting out. I ended up hiking with them most of the day. The two sons were both seniors in high school. They were from Raleigh North Carolina. The weather was fairly nice. I made it to Trent's grocery and had a wonderful hamburger and fries as well as a bag of Fritos and a Diet dr. pepper. I really couldn't eat anything more than that as my hiker hunger has still not developed. I had hoped to possibly get a ride into Woods Hole hostel but found out that they don't tend to pick up on that side of the mountain. As it was still early in the day I had it off with a North Carolina crew and did another 8 Miles making just over 20 for the day (not counting the road walk to Trent's). We eventually made it to Wapiti shelter and found the hiker from Connecticut whom I had met on the first day. The Wapiti shelter is somewhat famous because there were two murders at this location. Because thunderstorms were forecast 5 hikers and a dog lined up like pigs in a blanket in a shelter designed for six people. I know I pushed myself further than I should, but I still felt fairly strong and it was fun talking to someone while I hiked.

I  didn't sleep the best. In the morning Now headed out first. I had initially planned to hike with the North Carolina crew,  but they took a little too long getting ready so I headed out by myself. The walk into Woods Hole was relatively easy. I stumbled in. I got the quick tour and hopped into the shower and got laundry started right away.  I then drank a nice large smoothie and then even had a foot massage. It was one of the services they offered and I figured that it might help to prevent a few problems. It was relaxing. The dinner that night was excellent with a nice salad,  lots of homemade bread, pasta with both a hearty meat sauce or a homemade pesto sauce. There was even a cookie with some homemade ice cream. We ate family style. Besides Now, there were only some day hikers (most of whom had been on the AT in years past. Their bunkhouse was much nicer than the first one I had stayed at (Bear Garden), but it was obvious that they were still trying to improve the place as there were new plugins at each bed.  I realized my charger was lousy as my phone only charged to 79% overnight.","Wapiti shelter

I walked particularly easily as I only had a small daypack on. In Pearisburg,  Now had to stop by at the Angels Rest hostel where he was staying (and where he had had a new pair of shoes delivered). The two of us then headed to the nearby Food Lion for my first resupply.  This was a harder than expected process, particularly because they don't sell pre-made dehydrated meals. I eventually made my selections and then had to camp out like a homeless person until my ride picked me up.  I even purchased the lettuce for the evening's dinner (which I donated in exchange for a few freezer bags which I had forgotten). I had to spend my time getting my meals organized. This evening’s dinner was also excellent with a stir fry with seasoned beef on top of fried rice.  That day I met Odie who is the author of The Hiker Yearbook.

I walked out to the unheated showerhouse (where our toilet was). While urinating I noticed a layer of ice in the bowl (something I had never experienced). The toilet was unable to be flushed as the inflow lines were also frozen.  I had a nice breakfast which was similar to yesterday's but included a peach cobbler. I also discovered a new type of orange which was excellent (Caracara). I paid my bill and included a small donation for the broke hiker fund. I had been debating over my trail name for some time. Very few people recognized the name Fleischman (but the few who did loved the name). Several people kept calling me Doc. However I have now settled on the name of Trailblazer which was suggested on Facebook.  My wife seems to be enjoying the fact that her posts and my pictures have been more popular than we expected as it seems that many people are enjoying vicariously following along. 
I got a ride back down to Pearisburg and started hiking. Quickly I crossed the New River (which is the same river which connects to the Summit Bechtel Reserve where I had been this past summer at the Boy Scouts Jamboree). I  made reasonable progress. Several hours into the day, while taking a rest, Now came along and we hiked along together. He was very worried about some bad weather coming in several days. He suggested that we hike 18 miles today and then 22 tomorrow and then get a shuttle back to Angels rest hostel in Pearisburg.  If I did this, I would reduce the cost of the shuttles. I had some beautiful views of West Virginia. Before meeting up with Now, I had crossed a road and found a police officer. I had assumed that this was related to some construction, but later we met a hiker with a banjo who was looking for the treesitters. Apparently someone was camping at the top of a tree to protest a new pipeline which will cross the Appalachian Trail.  We eventually made it into Pine Branch shelter. While this shelter was officially closed, a team of trail maintainers had cleared the trees which had died from gypsy moths. With very little wind, we didn't fear sleeping there and the two of us had the shelter to ourselves. This was a hard day and I was unsure if I could do 22 miles tomorrow.","Woods Hole hostel

I even learned how to eat a snack without stopping (although I hated to do this because I was unsure about falling (which I still haven't done)). I briefly stopped on my own to take a few pictures but then had to scamper to catch up. I never completely committed to the plan as I thought I was pushing my mileage too quickly.  There had been one 1800 foot climb early in the day which I handled quite easily. But then the trail became extremely rocky. I was concerned about the weather and decided to push on as the idea of taking a zero was appealing. The final hill was also around 1800 feet of ascent and I started to fall behind Now. He went ahead in case the shuttle arrived early. I was able to beat the shuttle by ½ hour. We came back to Angels Rest hostel and then ate at Dairy Queen.  The pop tasted wonderful and I even ate a large Blizzard. The weather forecast still showed the potential for more than 3 inches of snow at higher elevations.

When he was checking out that morning,  I saw him pop open two beers. He said this was the best way to prevent a hangover. Two other guys had sprayed each other with pepper spray on a dare. The location was wonderful to get a quick snack from the grocery store. They had a trail which was a short cut to the back of the store.  For breakfast we snacked on items from the grocery. I consumed a container of raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries as well as a microwave egg and sausage meal. For lunch we went to the Mexican restaurant. While their chips and salsa and main dishes tended to be only fair, I had a wonderful side dish of grilled shrimp as well as an excellent margarita.  I updated some of my blog posts. For supper, we picked up a few more hikers and went to the Mexican restaurant a second time. Now wanted to stop at the local pharmacy so I went along and found my first Virginia geocache. Later that evening after talking with one of the new hikers, I agreed to call in an antibiotic for someone with a 102 fever who had a history of a infectious complication who allegedly didn't believe in western medicine,  but the real issue was a lack of insurance. While I am not licensed in Virginia, I have previously prescribed prescriptions for patients who have been on vacation.

I was pop overtaken by Grumpy, a gentleman from Massachusetts who is a high tech engineer.  We climbed up to Dragons Tooth, got the obligatory photo but then hightailed it down the hill because it was so cold and still drizzling.  We then walked to Four Pines hostel together. There was a nice mix of people here, including several bicyclists. We quickly got a ride to the grocery which was only a glorified gas station convenience store. I purchased a small pizza for supper as well as a few snacks.  We then rode back to the hostel. While there was a wood burning stove, it didn't put out much heat. There were lots of chickens and Guinea hens outside as well as a handful of cats who came in and out through a pet door. The wifi tended to be very weak. Four of us played a round of Rummy 500.

This turned out to be one of the hardest days on the trail. When I checked my Fitbit,  I found out why as we had climbed the equivalent of over 500 flights of stairs. This was supposed to have been the easiest of the next several days as were hoping to get to Glasgow to stay at a shelter to avoid some potential severe weather including heavy rains.  I decided to sleep in the shelter as only one other person had decided to do the same. We also picked up a new member to our entourage. No Doubt (a retired building inspector from Sarasota) had just started the trail 2 days previously. I found out that he is nearly legally blind form macular degeneration and also has COPD.  I helped him hang his bear bag as he had never done this yet. We also joked that we should call our group “Grumpy Old Men “ in honor of Grumpy. While it was a difficult day, I was unsure if I could keep up the pace tomorrow.

The problem was a 2200 ft climb at the end of the day.  The highest climb I had encountered up to this point was around 1300 ft. However this day seemed to go more easily. At the base of the large hill, I had only climbed the equivalent of 278 flights of stairs so I set out.  We didn't expect No Doubt to even try to get to the next shelter. During this section, I finally finished Gone With the Wind and then decided to listen to music before starting the next book. The music helped to motivate me up the hill.  While listening to my music,  I heard the Madonna song ""Material Girl "" and thought this would be a good moniker for Scarlett O'Hara.  At the shelter we met Yaki (named after a cartoon character) from Arizona who had hiked 1300 miles two years ago before tearing his calf muscle.

While there were two large hills,  most of the day was going to be downhill. The day was another warm one (and last night was the first in which I didn't wear my puffy jacket to bed). My clothes were starting to get saturated with dried salts from my perspiration.  I started a new book, a long fantasy trilogy which seemed to start out fairly well. I enjoyed passing underneath the Guillotine. We also met a trail maintainer who drives 1 ½ hr one way up from North Carolina three times a year to maintain his mile and a half of trail.  
When we got to the James River bridge,  I was starting to get impatient and that stretch along the river seemed to go on forever.  There were even some kids swimming in the river. We also had to pass a wedding party taking pictures on the bridge.  We laid out in the sunlight until the shuttle from Stanimal's came by. We jammed 6 people into a small car. I had to sit on the side of the hard plastic console.  Stanimal's seems nice, but somewhat small. I was assigned a bunk with 5 other people in a 10x12 room which seemed rather snug. Our group (which lost No Doubt) picked up another veteran hiker,  Grinder. We then went out to dinner at the local Italian restaurant. This was generally a fun affair. I had a large salad and a large calzone (which was actually too big so I saved some for tomorrow's lunch). I also had the decadent pleasure of two beers.  The hostel didn't have regular television so we were unable to watch regular television (NBA playoffs) so we went to sleep relatively early.","Cornelius Creek shelter

Two other hikers, Bucky, a woman from North Carolina and another hiker from Arizona decided to come along with me.  With our contingent of 3, we expanded the total number of attendees (including the service participants), from 11 to 14. The service was nice and we were invited for juice and cookies afterwards. The lay minister and his wife are both former FBI employees.  We then stopped off at Dollar General which was a nice store as it had nearly everything I needed. After an afternoon of lounging, we went out to dinner again st the Italian restaurant. I had a nice eggplant parmesan and even ordered an 11 inch submarine sandwich to eat for lunch on the trail.  Some of the party crowd arrived that evening. One of them reported that he had walked over a 7 foot rat snake so I know that at lower altitudes on warmer days the snakes may be out.

I filtered water at the shelter but forgot to check out the trail log where many hikers confessed to sins they had committed on the trail.  At the top I called my wife as she had been getting worried. I made it to the next shelter where I met a 2017 thru-hiker from Quebec as well as a police officer from Virginia Beach and someone else who worked at the Pentagon. For some reason this also was a hard day but I did have a relaxing evening with markedly warmer temperatures.  This evening marked the end of my first three weeks on the trail and I have completed 291 miles.

My energy started to lag and I slogged up the few decent ascents.  I kept expecting to hear city noises. Finally I heard a train and thought I was getting close but I was wrong. I eventually made it to the information station. My plan at first was to try to get a hotel,  but after calling several as well as a bed and breakfast, I found out that the entire town was booked because of a combination of a University of Virginia event as well as a flyfishing tournament. While it was clearly not my first option,  I eventually called Stanimal's. I was picked up quickly and was driven into town. I have been submitting some reviews through Google Guides and had only given the Glasgow location 4 stars, primarily because of the spotty wifi system as well as the fact that they tried to cram six adults and their packs into a small 10x12 room. In fact,  anyone trying to get into an upper bunk had to be careful that they didn't get their head chopped off by the large ceiling fan. This location was much nicer. In fact, as soon as I hit the door. I was welcomed by the rest of the Grumpy Old Men! This was a surprisingly cheerful event. Rather than getting breakfast, I got a shower and started laundry.  Before this was even finished, we went out to lunch. I actually walked to the burger joint wearing my rainpants. I had a nice lunch including a particularly thick shake which I had to eat with a spoon. We then were shuttled to the Super-Walmart across town. We only had 30 minutes which made the resupply interesting. I purchased a bottle of permethrin as some of my garments (particularly my pants) had already been laundered 4-5 times.  I also had to get a small carabiner as the one necessary for my bear bag to work correctly had just broken the night before. I even made some snack purchases, but I didn't have too many of these as we were planning to go to the Chinese restaurant all you can eat buffet for supper. The rest of the afternoon was quite restful. After applying the permethrin, I even sat outside and drank a Yeunglings beer with some younger hikers while the clothes and my tent were drying out.  Supper was excellent. This buffet had a wonderful selection with many different types of food. I had some soup and a lot of shrimp as well as multiple other delicacies even including frog's legs, sushi and different types of oysters. I did my best to get my money's worth (which was easy as I had more than three platefuls of food for only $12.99. I did wash this down with a Sapporo beer. We had to walk back but I found two more geocaches along the way. I then updated my blog while watching the NBA playoffs.  Just before 9 PM, I realized I had not gotten a sub for tomorrow's lunch. I quickly ran out to Subway to remedy this. I then stopped off at a gas station and was able to get two fresh Smartwater bottles (part of my water filtration system) well as some chips. I even had a lot more open room to organize my gear. I even reconnected with the older woman whom I had helped across the stream crossings several days before, but she was still only averaging about 10 miles daily so she had to be picked up 20 miles down the road.  The stay at this Stanimal's was much better than the one in Glasgow.

Fairly soon, we had to stop to get our free permit to hike in the National park.  I hiked a lot of the morning with Hard Knocks (who is a jack of all trades from Louisiana). I had previously seen him in Glasgow. While he had started in Georgia, he had hurt his ankle.  I looked at it and let him know that I didn't think it was too serious. You wouldn't believe how relieved he was as his family had been pestering him to get an MRI. He went out on the rest day and has remained on the trail.  I even found out that he is a trailjournals.com contributor as well (although I found out that his brother does most of the actual writing). The second half of the day was much harder. I made it to the shelter but was very tired.  I met a woman from Germany who had been hiking since Georgia. However she was really struggling. Besides having some knee pain (which I was never able to examine as she didn't want to talk much), I found out later that she had left an 8 year old daughter back at home who missed her mother.  She was planning to try to get to Harper's Ferry and it sounded like she was going to go back to Germany. I also met Lotus. He had shared a shelter with me way back on my second day. Since then he had hurt his knee and had to go off trail to let this heal. He decided to bring his two sons to backpack with him for a few days.  The boys (both in their early twenties) simply weren't able to keep up and didn't even get up that evening. While I remember I had never even disclosed to Lotus that I was a physician, he actually remembered my first name (possibly because I wasn't sure what my trail name was at that point, and white blazes are the primary trail marking system). While there were no major hills,  this still turned into one of the hardest days.

After about 9 miles, we stopped at our first Wayside Restaurant. We got there around 10:30 am. I ordered one of their breakfast meals as well as a BlackBerry milkshake (which I had read about many times). At 11 AM,  the menu changed to lunch and I got a hamburger, chili fries and a Coke. Perhaps my hiker hunger is starting to kick in, although I really don't truly crave food yet. While in the gift shop, I purchased a small container of apple walnut candy for the evening dessert.  I also met a section hiker and his wife. I had drained a blister for him. He had gone off trail to spend some time with his wife and then she developed some palpitations while the two of them were slackpacking. Now wanted to push on 23 miles, but part of his rationale was that he had just sent home his hammock so he didn't even have a tent any longer.  My energy really started to fade after about 15 miles. I hiked with Grumpy most of the afternoon. Grumpy and I eventually stealth camped on the top of a mountain. I tried to call my wife but was unsuccessful.

As I stood there, a former AT thru-hiker from the class of 2012 drove up and offered me a ride.  Since the hotel charged for shuttles, and because I wasn't sure how long I would have to wait, I accepted. He had to move a lot of trash around so I could even fit.  There was even a container of uneaten French fries that I had to step over. He offered another hiker a beer. I found the directions to the hotel but the volume was set too low to hear them.  The former hiker was interested in everything about my hike. My phone initially stated it would take 5 hrs to get to the hotel but it was set for walking. When I made the correction it was only 8 minutes.  Suddenly my phone changed stating it was going to take 55 minutes. He then tried his phone and it only said 9 minutes, but then his phone also changed the time to nearly an hour. Meanwhile, he had found out that I was a physician and he immediately started to ask me to write him a prescription for Adderall.  Eventually we realized we had headed off in the wrong direction. Perhaps because I had refused to write him the prescription, he dropped me off at the side of the road by a pullout view as he didn't have the time to even bring me back the 12 miles we had driven. I tried to hitchhike unsuccessfully. I spoke to my wife and called up Now.  He reminded me that the trail paralleled Skyline drive. He wanted me to hike back down but I was unsure how I could get back to where I had left the trail. Eventually I headed up the road and found the trail again. I hiked another 5 miles to another Wayside and had another large meal. I then walked to the next shelter. This proved to be fairly full already and Guthooks suggested that the shelter leaked anyway so I decided to rent.  Over supper, I found out that another hotel was open only 6 miles further. I decided to try to hike there tomorrow and would spend the night to get dried out. This was a very hard day, particularly because of the emotional stress as I struggled to figure out what to do.

I found a West Virginia geocache quite close to the ATC. I walked downtown and saw some of the sights including the John Brown wax museum which was quite informative and nicely crafted. I had a nice lunch with a flipflopper who had just gotten off the train as he was planning on starting out himself. I then slackpacked the section of the trail from downtown to the ATC. This portion of the trail included Jefferson Rock which my son and wife had hiked (and lorded this fact over me) about 5 years before.  After 1 p.m., I walked to Teahorse hostel. I had several pops and some ice cream while I waited for my friends to get in. I then met my first Iowan on the trail (from Maquoketa). Grumpy and Now finally made it In and we had our reunion. Because nearly every restaurant in our side of town was closed on Monday, we ate our supper with food from the nearby 7-11 (and I got to use the $5 gift card). This was a nice restful day. While Harper's Ferry is the psychological halfway point, for my hike I considered it to be the psychological quarter way point.","Stealth Site 1020.7

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591001,"I was on the trail before dawn as we had a 23 mile day planned.  This didn't include the mile long walk to get to the trail. The day started out nicely.  I crossed the bridge over the Potomac and entered Maryland. I then walked several miles along the C&O towpath trail which was quite interesting,  partially because I had virtually walked this trail on the walking4fun website. The trail then headed uphill. I found my very first Maryland geocache. Over the next several days   I passed multiple new flipfloppers. I finally finished listening to the Twinborn trilogy by JS Morin. This was a monster of a book as it had taken several weeks to listen to it all. While overall this was a fun book to listen to, it was far too long. Seeing the Washington monument was perhaps the most other thing which happened today.  I crossed over Interstate 70 and finally found our shelter for the night. Because all the new flipfloppers didn't feel comfortable staying in a shelter, I slept in the shelter instead. At this point I found out that Grumpy needed to go back to Boston and Now had decided to go back to Connecticut for several days.  I had priced out flights from Harrisburg, PA back home for about $450. A flight home from Boston would only be around $85. I decided to keep up with Grumpy and Now as they were planning on getting off the trail near Carlisle, PA","Harpers Ferry
",Pine Knob Shelter,"May 01, Tue",22.60
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591002,I slept horribly last night.  The acoustics of the shelter were such that the usual noises from my sleeping pad were accentuated.  The traffic noise from Interstate 70 was also substantial. The weather had turned significantly warmer as temperatures were in the mid 80’s. I passed Annapolis Rocks  (nothing special except a view). I then passed two flipfloppers who both write for Trailjournals.com- Willow (who recognized me as soon as I said I was from Wisconsin) and Sugarfoot.  I walked with them for a while but then had to pass to keep up with my friends. I also finished listening to Being Mortal by Dr. Atul Gawande. This book was excellent! I learned some pointers for helping people through their dying process.  I like to believe that I am better than the average physician as I get to take care of many of these patients after the oncologists are finished with them. However I probably have a tendency to be too blunt at times. Towards the end of the day  we reached PenMar park. We had debated staying there but it was apparent that camping there was illegal. We were able to get some free food (fried chicken) from a college prep school which was on a field trip. We then even ordered pizza which was delivered to the park.  We then decided to push on for about another ¾ mile. We passed the Mason Dixon line into Pennsylvania. I had finished Maryland in two days. We then found a beautiful campsite with a babbling stream to help cut down other noises. I took my first sponge bath using my buff while soaking my feet which helped tremendously to get the dried salt from perspiration off my skin.  The other major accomplishment of the day was having gone over 500 miles for the trip. This had been my goal for this leg of my trip. I am a bit worried about my boots as they are starting to fall apart in multiple areas. I can definitely feel the lack of cushioning.,"Pine Knob Shelter

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591004,"I slept wonderfully overnight.  The babbling stream and no snorers nearby really helped.  Because the temperature was supposed to approach 90 today, we had agreed to start hiking around first light (about 30 minutes before sunrise). The first part of the hike went fine.  I liked our first shelter as there were two shelters, one designated for snorers and the other designated for non-snorers. Shortly after this shelter, I seemed to lose my energy. Part of this was undoubtedly related to having three consecutive long days,  and a portion was related to increased foot pain as I had had a section of tread break off of my boots. I really slogged along the second half of the hike. I finished listening to Julius Caesar which I had originally read back in high school. I didn't get much out of rereading this. It might have been better to listen to the performance while reading the text. When we finally got to Fayetteville,  we were unsuccessful with hitchhiking so we had a moderately long walk to the Trail of Hope hostel. We even stopped at a restaurant and ate a large meal and rehydrated before getting to the hostel. At this point, because the weather was going to be rainy, Grumpy and Now had decided to leave the trail.  For multiple reasons we were unable to rent a car. We thought that we might have to hike through the weekend so we resupplied. We were supposed to go to the close Dollar General but the shuttle driver took us all the way across town to the Walmart (and then after the fact, he charged us $5 each for his mistake). This hostel caretaker reminded me of a typical hillbilly complete with the beard.  Most of us couldn't understand half of what he said as he slurred all of his words. There was also someone who I didn't trust as he reported that he had broken two bones in his feet and several toes but wasn't even in a splint. He also seemed to be an expert on everything. I tried to steer clear of him as he almost seemed to be a pseudo-hiker.","Stealth Site 1066.3

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591005,"We all slept horribly last night.  It was very sticky and there was very little ventilation.  In addition, the hostel was built on a busy highway and didn't have much soundproofing so we all heard a  lot of traffic noise all night long. In addition, the loudest snorer of the trip bunked in my room. This is definitely not the hostel to do slackpacking as you would have to go back for a second night.  We were uncertain about hiking. We were finally able to secure a rental car. After getting an Uber to Carlisle, PA, we then drove up to Boston, dropping off Now in Connecticut. I stayed overnight at Grumpy's home. The car trip only took about 6 hrs.  After a beer or two, I was shown to the guest area and was surprised to see a movie poster on the wall from “Gone with the Wind” (which was an important movie for Grumpy's wife). The following morning, Grumpy helped me box up my backpack to protect it on the plane trip and helped me get a shuttle down to Logan airport.  As he said goodbye, he stated that he felt that he had met particular people on the trail for particular reasons. I had forgotten that he had initially complained of some thigh pain which I quickly realized was related to wearing his backpack incorrectly. He even stated that he may try to rejoin me when we both need to hike from Atkins,  Virginia down to Springer Mountain. I felt honored that he felt that I had made such an impact. I hope that I can have a similar impact when I do the first half of a traditional SoBo thru-hike. I then flew home to Minneapolis where my wife picked me up at the airport. I may hike some new sections of the Ice Age Trail to try to stay in shape but I won't be writing too much probably until I am approaching my return to the trail. I have done 528.0 miles. While I can use a break, I am more confident that I will be able to continue. So long for now!","Fayetteville, PA

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592964,"I spent several weeks at home. Because I had returned sooner than I had initially planned, I had several days off prior to returning to work. I powerwashed and stained my deck. I was able to watch several of my son's varsity baseball games (as these were more interesting when he was consistently starting and playing at either second base, third base or even occasionally pitching). I also went through the mountain of mail which greeted my arrival and got my financial affairs completely caught up. I also did some other yard work as spring had just come to Wisconsin as well. I sported my beard around town for several days including going to church, the local rotary club and my worksite at our community hospital. I had an interview with the local web-based news site: https://drydenwire.com/news/gr...   However, within several days of returning home, I shaved off my beard. This was partially because my wife hated it, but the primary reason I got rid of it was because my driver's license was up for renewal and I didn't want my license to show a bearded me for the next eight years. After a week, I returned to work. I had been off work for seven weeks and thought I might be ready to go back to work. However, while my patients were genuinely happy to see me back (and wanted to ask lots of questions which I had only limited time to answer), I realized that I really wasn't ready to go back to work. I still had much unfinished business on the trail. I had also spent very little time thinking about how work was going to figure into the rest of my life. Except for reading Atul Gawande's book ""Being Mortal"", I had intentionally chosen to not think about work. Fortunately, I had chosen to only work for half days, but I found that I consistently didn't get home until ~3:30 pm every day (which is a lot better than my usual 7 pm doing many of my dictations during the weekend). I was glad to be finished with work when the final week finished. I did hike in the woods several times, but found that I really was not motivated to get much exercise done during this time. I didn't even reach 70,000 steps for the first three weeks after I arrived home. Part of this was intentional as I needed time to heal up. My feet took a beating when the tread of my shoe wore down. My Achilles tendonitis and the instep of my opposite foot have largely healed up and the bursitis in my hip also seemed to heal reasonably well. I hope I will be ready to return and will hopefully not push myself so much during the rest of my trip. When I returned home, I saw that I had lost 17 pounds (but more importantly three notches on my belt). By the time I flew to Nantucket, I had picked up 7 pounds, but I am not worried about this weight because I assume that most of this is simply glycogen (which is the immediate energy source used by muscles. Glycogen is simply glucose (sugar) molecules fused with water to other sugar molecules. Your muscles and liver store this up as an immediate energy source for emergencies. This is also used up early during exercise and explains the so-called water weight loss of ~10 pounds which occurs when people start diets. Many people start diets and are encouraged by the rapid weight loss during the first week but then get discouraged when the losses significantly slow. This is when they should be continuing to diet and exercise as fat is only then becoming the primary energy source. My son's graduation went fine. My wife's parents drove up from Nebraska to attend. The awards night, baccalaureate service, graduation ceremony went fine. We hosted a very nice graduation party for my son and attended similar parties for some of his classmates whom we have gotten to know. While my wife was very emotional, I'm proud of my son but am glad to have this phase of my life end. I had originally planned to start my return trip on June 4th or 5th. However, I started to watch a webcam of Mount Katahdin and saw there was still a significant amount of snow. Eventually I chose to postpone my return to the trail for two days to allow the snow to melt a little more. This allowed me to spend a nice Memorial Day weekend at home. Following this, my wife and I had a nice vacation to Nantucket, MA. My sister had purchased a summer home here about eight years ago (as she lives in Florida and wanted to escape the heat). She is ten years older than I am and has now largely retired. Her husband is a pharmacist who is able to work for his Florida hospitals online from Nantucket. My wife and daughter had visited them five years ago while my son and I went to the 2013 Boy Scout National Jamboree. She definitely wanted to return. This trip provided her with the incentive to fly to the east coast. We stayed with them for a week. During this week, I did start walking and biking more. There were a lot of sites to see. We were close enough to town that I could walk there. Nantucket has an excellent trail system and we biked from the main town to the east end of the island several times (16-22 mile trip depending on which trail). I found my rear end didn't like the biking and I really wanted to get my legs in shape so for the second part of this trip, I did a lot of walking. I started reading ""Ready Player One"" which was recently made into a major motion picture directed by Steven Spielberg. I found this to be truly engaging as it talked about a lot of my interests including music and movies from the 1980's (which was a formative decade for me as I was in college and medical school during this time). It also included other interests including Dungeons and Dragons and computer games which I also enjoy. I ate out a fair amount including having lobster, scallops, clams, and other seafood (particularly locally caught flounder). Nantucket is definitely a ritzy place. Restaurants were certainly expensive. However, most people tended to be open and friendly. There are many billionaires who live on Nantucket but they tend to be people who would not be recognized on the street. Truly famous people tend to vacation on places like Martha's vineyard where there are far more barriers to protect their privacy. This tends to not be needed on Nantucket. Even though I was eating relatively rich food, by staying active, I feel I am in better shape than when I arrived. I made consecutive 30,000 step days and definitely noticed that I was achy. However, this was a good exercise program to get ready for the trail (although I know that hills will be difficult as there are not many hills on Nantucket). My sister recently purchased a different home on Nantucket and now lives between someone who formerly owned Whole Foods (before it was sold to Amazon) and an author. They encouraged me to consider moving here but I am not sure I am ready for such a dramatic change of residence We are about to return to Boston. We will then rent a car and drive up to Millinocket. We will arrive there Tuesday afternoon. I will summit Mount Katahdin on either Wednesday or Thursday depending on weather. I am hoping to hike from Katahdin Streams campground to Abol bridge on the day I do not summit Katahdin. If this works out, on the final day, my wife will drive me to Abol Bridge and drop me off to start the 100 mile wilderness and then she will return to Boston to catch her return flight home.  I have kept up with Now (who is now in Massachusetts) and Grumpy (who got injured in New Jersey and is currently recovering at home in Boston). It is surprising that all three of us are in different parts of Massachusetts at the same time. Hopefully I can reconnect with them later on the trail.   At this point, I am really anxious to get back to the trail. Hopefully my next post will be from the trail!","Wisconsin

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593340,"I'm finally back on the trail.  The weather forecast wasn't particularly favorable for summiting on either of my options.  We arrived in Millinocket on Tuesday evening and went to the New England Outdoor Center for dinner.  We talked to two locals about the 100 mile wilderness. One of them had just hiked this section. They said the black flies hadn't been horrible.  Camping on the shore of large lakes also seemed to help with the bugs (particularly mosquitoes). I didn't sleep very well. The forecast for today called for clearing skies in the afternoon.  As a result I had a leisurely breakfast at the AT cafe. While there I could tell there was another thru-hiker. I started up a conversation with Footprint. Serendipitously, he had just finished the entire trail in 97 days and was the first 2018 finisher.  I had a nice conversation with him and purchased his breakfast for him. Footprint is also now a Triple Crowner!
We drove to Baxter State Park.  The rangers were all off that day getting some sort of required training.  As a result, I didn't have to pay the entry fee but I was also not able to get the required permit to hike the trail.  I decided to hike up the Abol trail and then come down on the Appalachian trail on the Hunt trail. I decided to take a leisurely trip up the mountain as I hoped the clouds would clear.  The trail started out easy, but then became progressively harder. Eventually I was constantly climbing up large boulders. The Abol trail ended about a mile from the Summit where I started the next leg of my flipflop thru-hike.  Even here, clouds obliterated the summit and it started to drizzle. I made my way to the summit. I had to take a selfie as there was no one else up there. I had some food and explored the summit. However by 2:15, there was no sign of the clouds clearing so headed down.  About two tenths of a mile, I ran into someone heading for the summit. I quickly reversed course and went back to the summit. He took better pictures and I took his pictures. It was still cloudy so I again headed down. The way down was often harder once I had to start bouldering again.  As long as I took my time, I was able to surmount every obstacle, but my heart kept sinking when I saw the next significant hurdle. Fortunately, I was listening to a great book on Audible, “Ready Player One “. This had a lot of references to movies, songs and computer games from the 1980s which was the formative decade for me.  Eventually I made it back to our rental car where my wife was starting to panic. The entire trip took about 9 hrs for the 5.2 miles I added to my AT total. This was definitely the hardest extended bouldering I had ever done. When I tried to get out of the car, I found I could hardly stand. I believe that this was one of the hardest things I have ever done so I am a bit concerned about the White Mountains.","Mount Katahdin

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593348,"Again I didn't sleep very well.  I wanted my wife to get some pretty pictures of the mountain as it had cleared up overnight but was expected to start raining around noon today.  As a result, we got up early and headed to Abol bridge in the dark. Along the way, we saw a good sized moose but we only were able to get in one photo before it headed into the woods.  
We got to Abol bridge.  While the view of the mountain was impressive, the sunrise wasn't particularly pretty. I set off and had a pretty nice day.  While I had been pretty sore overnight, unless I was climbing, the hiking didn't bother me much at all. I found a better place to watch the sunrise.  I crossed over into Baxter Park and then was amazed at how much water I was able to hike beside. I started walking along the Penobscot River and then several streams.  Later I edged by Massey Pond. There were multiple waterfalls. I had two difficult stream crossings but I succeeded in staying dry while crossing both of them. I also met multiple southbounders.  Seven of them are planning on thru-hiking. One will be section hiking until Hanover, New Hampshire. The 10 mile hike took just over 4 hrs. After that, my wife and I mailed back the clothes and duffel bag I used while in Nantucket.  I also arranged for several days of meals to be delivered about 69 miles into the Hundred Mile Wilderness.

Because we had gone to bed early last night,  we were shortly after dawn around 5 a.m.. We checked out of the hotel and drove to Abol bridge. Similar to when she first dropped me off in Atkins, she walked with me about a mile into the woods.  This was probably a bit of a mistake as she walks a lot slower and I started to get eaten by mosquitoes, particularly when she would stop to take pictures. We made our tearful goodbyes and she recorded me as I headed into the woods.  It had rained overnight and everything was damp. I had my second fall of the entire trail on a slippery boardwalk type of log by a low spot. Later that day I had a second fall, this time talking with Doc Tigger, a family physician from around Detroit.  He's about 11 years older. I walked with him for a while but then it was apparent that he was not able to keep up so we separated. I saw 10 toads and a Leopard frog. While I had been fretting about the bugs, they were surprisingly mild compared to what I've encountered in Wisconsin. As long as I kept moving the mosquitoes weren't able to bother me and there was a breeze so I was usually able to find a resting spot without bugs.  I also realized that Wisconsin also has Black Flies. I tend to call them gnats or sand fleas. Their population today was very manageable. I realized that I usually just let them fly around me as they don't tend to bite much early in the season (or perhaps my skin is too thick for them to bite through). I wore a short sleeved shirt and never even applied bug Repellent the entire day. I talked with a few other southbounders. One woman was taking a zero day on her 7th day on the trail (this was my third). She had recently graduated from college and isn't really sure what she will be doing.  For a lot of the day I also talked with Dry Bones, who is an older retired engineer but who still drives a bus to have something to do. I also met three Northbounders who were finishing up their hikes. Overall the day turned out well with good weather, controllable bugs and lots of water to hike beside. There were only a few small hills but lots of slippery roots. I could see how former AT hikers compare the Superior Hiking Trail to this section of Maine as the terrain was very similar, including many cedar swamps. I eventually hiked about 27.5 miles.

I seemed to feel great today. My back pain was gone and I seemed to make good speed.  For the second day in a row, there were still people in the shelters by the time I had already walked several miles. I walked a lot of the day with a young man who had went to Cornell College.  While this school mimics my alma mater, I was able to discuss the college because of the time I spent in Iowa City attending my residency. There seemed to be fewer people on the trails today. I only met a couple from St. Louis and a section hiker from Boston who was backpacking the 100 mile wilderness.  Again I mostly only saw toads. The bugs were a bit worse today but I still didn't need any bug spray. Generally it was a great day. The weather was perfect. I walked past some more beautiful lakes and was able to get a few long distance views of Mount Katahdin.  I also realized that I think the hiatus away from the trail was good for me. While I did lose some of my trail legs, they seem to be coming back quickly.  More importantly, I realized I definitely want to be out here. By starting down south. I learned the ropes in more forgiving territory. Now I will be able to get through the 100 mile wilderness and the White Mountains with relative ease. I have tried to educate the southbounders but have realized that they will have to learn what works for them.  Some of them have gigantic packs, but this is partially related to having to carry so much food. I finished backpacking relatively early, around 3 PM because I had already covered 19 miles and I found a beautiful campsite right on the lakefront. As a bonus, Antlers Campsite even has decent internet. It feels odd to sit around this long. It also seems odd to call a 19 mile day relatively light.

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594148,"Shortly after going to bed, I  kept hearing my ground pad making crinkling noises.  Before long, I realized that it had sprung a leak. Surprisingly,  I slept fairly well. I will have to get a new one in Monson. This, combined with knowing my wife is fretting over my trip in the 100 mile wilderness made me try for a 20 mile day.  I woke before dawn and left my campsite around 5 AM, just as the sunrise was coming up over the lake. It was pretty but not particularly spectacular. I shot a few photos and started on my way.  Just before dark last night a first grade teacher from Clearwater, FL arrived with a dog. Rather than getting his camp chores done (getting water, getting his tent set up and hanging his bear bag), he proceeded to try to start a fire.  He was planning on starting it on top of several large logs which shouldn't have been in the firepit to begin with. When I told him the error in his ways, he said he was going to do it anyway. He got his pile of kindling started using his camp stove and this quickly burned out.  In addition, he had hung his bear bag incorrectly as it was too close to the tree trunk. I tried to tell him how to correct this using a carabiner (PCT method), but he didn't think it was necessary. I went to bed at that point. In the morning, I found much of his gear spread around the campsite as he had not secured it. He was still sawing logs so I started walking.  
The hiking seemed to go great.  The terrain was much easier and I made good time. After about an hour,  I suddenly felt the urge to defecate. I went off trail and felt much better after tending to business.  I remembered that I almost fell when I tripped over a branch which was tangled around my opposite foot. I didn't think much about this at the time as I wasn't hurt.  
When I made it to the next shelter, (8 miles away), once again everyone was either asleep or barely stirring.  I met several more hikers. One of them was carrying a large green camping propane canister. Another was proud that his pack weighed 65 pounds.  I can't believe that so many southbounders have so little experience. The majority of them recently graduated and don't know what they want to do.  I know that I was green once myself so I will try to be a resource but the majority of the time, these people don't want any help. 
After filtering two liters of water, I started down the path again.  2.5 miles further on I found a beautiful site and reached for my phone.  It was gone! I had already hiked over 10 miles but I knew that I had taken several pictures.  After considering my options, I started to retrace my steps. I met all of the people who had stayed at the shelter but no one had found my phone.  I continued to retrace my steps. I was fortunate that I was able to find the place where I had done my business earlier in the day, but my phone wasn't there as well.  I drank a liter of water and had a snack and reconsidered my options again. This time I decided to check around the area as I had remembered being tripped. If not I would have to continue back without my phone.  Just before I gave up, I spotted my unharmed phone lying on the ground. I was very relieved but mad at myself. I felt that God was reminding me to not judge the southbounders so harshly. I started backpacking again.  I actually met the person who I had camped with the night before and apologized after telling him my story even though he hadn't even been offended. I had to readjust my plans. I eventually hiked over 23 miles, but only 12 was in the positive direction.  I really struggled climbing a small mountain and called it quits. Even though the next shelter is all downhill, once again I had decent cellular coverage. I was also able to find a spot to camp which wasn't rocky. 
In hindsight,  this turned out to be a challenging day.  However, I was able to backpack over 23 miles. In Lord of the Rings lexicon,  I've turned this phase of my trip into the Eleventy One Mile Wilderness.

I got another early start leaving shortly after 5 AM.  I passed 2 shelters in the first seven miles. Both still had hikers who were starting to stir. I was able to tell people that I had retrieved my phone.  The first climb over Whitecap Mountain was much easier than the hike up the smaller mountain the evening before but I suspect that this was simply because I was fresher.  Intermittently, I hiked with a couple who were both from California but had moved to Chicago to try to further their acting careers which didn't pan out. As a result, they are both considering career changes.  I also met a special ed teacher from St. Louis. Generally, I am faster than all the other southbounders (until these young people get their trail legs) as I have passed lots of hikers and except when I was backtracking yesterday,  no one has passed me.

Again after 3 ½ miles, there were people still sleeping.  However there were also 4 hikers ready to hit the trail. One of them I had met before who had attended Cornell college. There was another young woman who had served in the peace corps in Thailand.  The most interesting couple were a 50ish woman and her 26 year old son. She was a nurse who needed a break. He was a corporate finance officer for Kimberly Clark who had been offered a severance package as part of downsizing his division.  I also met 4 Northbounders who were finishing up their hikes. Again the weather was fabulous, however according to the last forecast I had seen, the weather was supposed to change tomorrow. As a result, my initial plan was to try to get a reasonably large day to make the following day into Monson much easier.  However, this was not to be. While the terrain looked favorable at first glance, there was a lot of steep ups and downs. Towards the end of the day I accidentally went off trail and went a long way down without realizing it. I must have found a parallel trail as I wasn't too far away from the trail. I initially retraced my steps but then found I was actually going away from the trail back up a steep trail.  Then i followed the gravel road I had found myself hoping it joined up with the gravel road crossing I was supposed to do. However after walking a half mile in the opposite direction there was no sign of the other road. I finally got as close as I could using these trails and had to bushwhack through the woods about a tenth of a mile. By the time I found the trail it was getting late and I was beat. I only walked another half mile and set up for the night.  I also tried to repair my ground pad. By inflating the pad and holding it under water, I located the leak and put on a repair patch. However this didn't really stop the leak. I did go over the 100 mile mark for this leg of the trail. Hopefully I will be able to get into Monson relatively quickly tomorrow as I'm ready for this leg of the trip to end. I really need a shower and I'm really looking forward to both the brewpub in town as well as a great breakfast served at one of the hostels.","East Chairback Pond

I could hear a beer calling my name! The rain which had been predicted held off until that evening so I was able to go through the 100 mile wilderness without getting any rain! The day really wasn't too hard but I could tell I really needed a rest day.  I slogged through most of the day. I ran into a snapping turtle, surprisingly about 300 feet above any water at Barren Ledges as I had never seen a snapping turtle so far away from water. At the last shelter i met Housekeeping who had done most of a SoBo thru-hike last year. I then started to meet day-hikers so I knew I was getting close. When I asked one couple if they were thru-hikers the man said “No, but we're still good people “! The day was warmer than any of the prior days and I think I drank 6 liters of water.  I finally made it to the trailhead. I was out!
As luck would have it, a shuttle from Shaw’s hostel showed up as they were shuttling someone to Millinocket.  I got a ride into town. I was exhausted. After getting the quick tour, I showered and did my laundry. I was even able to do my resupply and purchase a new ground pad, a new Big Agnes insulated pad lighter (and more expensive) than my current pad. Finally I walked into town and had a great meal (but again a little pricey) of bacon wrapped scallops,  a shaved beef, cheese onion and pepper sandwich called the bomb, fried, a side salad, and an ice cream sundae brownie dessert all washed down with a local beer, Allagash White and a glass of Malbec wine.

He had just started and was thinking of stopping because of knee pain when I met him the first time I stopped at Fresh Grounds. He listened to my advice and had hiked all the way to Springer mountain. The other one was a medical student from Penn State whom I had met briefly at Stanimal's in Waynesboro.  I met more hikers. My right heel is bothering me but it's not the same Achilles tendinitis I had had coming off trail. I believe I overstretched the tendon coming down off a steep rock.

I initially hiked with Insect and Free Range,  two sisters who were hiking the trail together. The terrain was very nice and I made good time. At the first shelter, I met up with Mantra who has lived in many areas including the Bronx and the Dominican Republic. Prior hikers had left a fire smoldering. We tried to put it out.  I felt good enough to possibly go further, but they the time I had reached the second shelter, it was after 5 p.m. so I decided to stop.

I  may not have blown it up enough as I found that I could still feel the ground if I wasn't perfectly flat. It was a bit quieter.  I got an early start.  I had to climb several mountains today. The first peak. Moxie Bald, was conquered easily. I took my first video on the summit.  I met  Scoutmaster who is a reasonably famous YouTube vlogger.  We talked for a while and I asked him about the World Jamboree.  He didn't film me.  The second peak, Pleasant Mountain was horrendous. Part of this was making an error to not bring enough water. It was also a reasonably warm day. At the top I briefly spoke with my wife but didn't have a good connection.  I needed to descend quickly and promptly drank nearly two liters at the first stream.

Even if I had had a minimal tear, it had clearly not progressed so I thought I could safely walk on it. I purchased an extra day of food in the event that I had to cover minimal ground.  I actually thought that I was even starting to go through my mental phase as there were other people at the hostel complaining about injuries. They sounded a bit like they were whining. Was I whining? I remembered the saying “No pain, no rain, no Maine"". I know my Achilles was swollen but that was improving already.  
I set out around 8:30 after a large breakfast at the hostel.  I got to the Kennebec river first and then waited around for a half hour until the canoeist arrived.  I was able to paddle a little which helped us get across easier because of a significant wind.

I  got a slightly later start as I was woken with a start by a woodpecker nearly over my head. I was on trail by 5:30. Knowing that I would be doing some climbing today,  I used a buff to fashion a sort of heel lift in the bottom of my right boot to prevent me from overstretching that tendon. While yesterday had started with multiple waterfalls and then progressed to lakes and soggy trails,  today started with lakes and soggy trails but then pushed on into mountains. I had been told that the trail started to get really hard with the Bigelow mountains so I was a bit apprehensive. I met several Northbounders including three people who all remembered me. The first was a couple from Minneapolis who had shared a stealth campsite by Laurel Falls on my third night out.  The other one was Glowworm whom I met several times around the end of the Shenandoahs and Front Royal.
The first part of the hike went by quickly.  However when the mountain climbing started, I slowed considerably.  However I kept a good attitude and rarely had to stop. It seems that my mountain climbing legs are starting to return.  I made it up to the top of Little Bigelow mountain fairly quickly so I continued on. The next climb was harder and longer.  It was also at the end of the day. However I was able to summit Avery Bigelow mountain and make it to a campsite between this peak and the last and highest peak in this chain. My ankle squawked at me a little, but actually seemed to bother me less even though I walked further and climbed far more.  The swelling also gradually seemed to subside. 
Overall it turned into a great day.  It has been interesting watching my emotions change from extreme confidence in the 100 mile wilderness to pessimism dealing with my Achilles injury back to more confidence that I will be able to finish this goal.  Part of the reason I had a better day was the book I listened to today. After being somewhat bored for weeks by Hamilton, I listened to “The Alchemist “. My daughter had read this book with a group of girls on a canoe trip in the Boundary Waters.  The book was short, only 4 hours long. When I finished it. I simply exhaled and realized I was meant to read this. I immediately listened to it a second time. The messages of pursuing your dreams, persisting in the face of adversity, traveling to see the world even though your treasure may be close by all resounded with me. A good book may be one solution for negative thoughts.  Today was my 50th day on the trail and I passed the 700 mile mark suggesting that I will finish in about 150 days.","West Carry Pond Lean-to

I went across the street to a local bar/restaurant and had a large lunch and two beers.

I joined the group but fell asleep on the lawn fairly quickly. Unfortunately someone pulled out some marijuana and nearly everyone participated. I left shortly after that. Times like these are when I miss more mature hikers as right now it seems that I'm the only old southbounder.  I had forgotten the date as this was both the solstice as well as Hike Naked Day.

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596078,"I slept poorly,  mostly because a “chance “ of thunderstorms raged all night long.  There was very little wind, but I hadn't been expecting it. When it was obvious that the rain would last for a while,  I closed my side doors. However I had forgotten to bring my boots under the vestibule so both my boots and socks were soaked.  Because it was dark longer, I didn't get out of camp until around 5:45. The rain seemed to have finally stopped but it remained cloudy for several hours and when I climbed my first hill,  I was quickly in fog. There seemed to be water everywhere on the trail. I was able to climb the first mountain but then I was nearly stranded up there because the descent was steep and the fresh water made everything slick. I  just took things very slowly but remained in fear of falling the entire day. As a result, my speed was less than 1 mile per hour. Towards the end of the day, the rocks finally started to dry out, but it turned into a hot, and extremely humid day which slowed me down further.  By the time I decided to call it a day, over 10 hours of hiking netted me less than 10 miles. I tended to be depressed by the lack of progress, but I did find time to celebrate when I crossed into New Hampshire. Three states are completely finished and I've done well more than half of Virginia, but all this has only completed 37 % of the trail. Hopefully the rain is finished for the next several days.  I hope to get to Gorham, NH tomorrow. I hope to stay at the Rattle River hostel. This past year there had been an article in the local newspaper about Eric Barstow who had purchased this hostel. I made contact with him and even have his personal cellphone number. As I finish writing this. the temperature remains fairly high and it's very sticky. I'm trying to get things to dry as I stepped in a lot of puddles today.","Full Goose Shelter

I seem to wake up without an alarm around the time that the Veeries start their beautiful call.  I'm not sure how I am going to wake up later this summer when they stop calling as consistently. My clothes had been soaked with perspiration yesterday and they didn't dry much overnight.  As soon as I got hiking I could tell that I was sweating again as the day looked like it would be a scorcher. Fortunately the terrain was a bit kinder today. While there certainly were some steep ascents and descents,  there were fewer of them and most of them were dry. At the top of the last hill I took an extended break, mostly to dry out my feet, socks and boots. Sequentially while I was doing this, I had interesting conversations with three other hikers.  The final descent was long but had mild terrain. I finally finished the Prayer for Owen Meaney (which was an excellent book). For some reason the streams on this side of the mountain were all dry. As a result I was parched when I finally arrived at the Rattle River hostel.  I splurged for a private room, partially to help out the owner (whom I had referred to recently), but more importantly because the bunk rooms were not air conditioned and I found out the air temperature was 92 and the heat index was 105. That's part of the reason I struggled for the last several days.  I immediately consumed a pint of ice cream
 We went to Walmart and I purchased a lot of food.  I had a nice meal. While I had been hoping to slackpack,  everyone recommended to lightpack instead. This was a new term for me.  I would hike the 21 miles over two days, gain the terrain advantage of hiking this section northbound, and not have to carry so much food or even my cold weather gear which I have still been carrying.  This morning, when I tightened my belt, it also seemed that I have lost another notch off my waist. I've been wearing a belt made from webbing which I had purchased two years ago at Philmont. When I started the trail,  I was several inches away from the letters (looking at the section held between the clasp of the belt). When I had finished the first leg of my hike. I had just started to see the O. Over the 4 week break, I reverted back to seeing the N. I now can generally see the M of Philmont now which makes me lighter than I was when I finished the Philmont trek. Hopefully I can still continue to lose a bit more weight before I return home.  While I know it will be very hot, I want to take advantage of any dry days as I am still very scared of falling on slick wet rocks.

We talked about Wisconsin as he had grown up near Centuria. The first mile was easy even though it was obvious that it was going to be a stifling day.  Suddenly the trail started upwards. This was the hardest sustained climb yet. I had been told to simply put away my trekking poles as my arms were needed for the constant mountain climbing for over 2000 feet. I then had some steep downs as well.  Suddenly, when I wasn't particularly worried about falling, my left trekking pole gave way and I had a big fall. I did a complete somersault and barely was able to protect my face. Two of my water bottles as well as my phone went flying. Most significant however was that my left trekking pole had snapped,  and not where the flextip was designed to break. I also hyperextended my elbow and got a few scratches, the largest one appearing on my left knee. I moved slowly the rest of the day. I was not able to get to the Imp shelter (which had been my goal, but I did hike several more miles after the fall. I also have developed the first blister of the entire trip on my right small toe which was probably caused by hiking for two days in wet socks.  I've really been getting discouraged as the trail has gone from hiking to mountain climbing. I'm constantly amazed at how my emotions vacillate between optimism and pessimism. I now have little hope of enjoying the White mountains and merely want to survive going through them. Tomorrow is another day. I plan to get up early to get some hiking done before it gets too hot.

I got up early, actually setting an alarm to make sure that I had enough time to get back into town if I was still hiking slowly.  While I was still achy in many areas, my elbow felt better and I was able to use it more today. I realized I could still use my broken hiking pole without a tip and this worked satisfactorily. I generally made slow but steady progress.  I was initially concerned about water as I had finished the last of my water before I had headed out. I found a small steady trickle directly on the trail and I filtered that. Water wasn't a problem the rest of the day. After I climbed over two peaks,  the trail generally went steadily downhill and the last three miles was quite nice. I reached the hostel by 2:30 PM. I was able to relax the rest of the day. I didn't even bother going into town as I was simply relieved to have made it back. I plan to take another zero tomorrow,  partially to give myself more time to heal but also to look into getting some replacement trekking poles. Tomorrow night some thunderstorms are supposed to come through after which the heat will hopefully break.

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596366,"I was a bit restless overnight as I was worrying about going back out in the mountains.  Initially I was unsure about whether to take a double zero. The weather forecast called for storms tonight,  finishing around 10 am tomorrow morning followed by a string of good weather days with lower humidity. However there will be high winds up to 70 mph on the top of Mount Madison and the low temperatures tomorrow night are forecasted to be only 33 degrees.  I thought I would make a late start tomorrow and then hike only about 5 miles tomorrow to give me a jump start on the better weather days coming ahead. Perhaps I might even summit Mount Washington on a sunny day?
Around noon,  I caught the shuttle into town.  I was lucky because the local small outfitter only carried one brand of trekking poles but it was Black Diamond.  They even had a pair of the Trail Ergo poles which I had been using for the past three years. Those poles had supported me for nearly 2000 miles of hiking so I was happy to stay with the same brand.  The only difference is they only carried the woman’s model. The maximum length is slightly less than the male model but it is still 5 cm longer than I usually use. I also was able to replace my boots which were already falling apart and might not last through the White mountains.  I purchased a pair of Merrill's trailrunners. I've used these before. While they were very comfortable, they didn't seem to last as long as other shoes. However, with better traction, if they can get me safely through the White mountains, the purchase will be worth it. I also purchased food for the next segment through the Presidential range of the White mountains.  Otherwise I just lounged around resting for the day.","Gorham, NH

The radar showed another line but smaller.  I decided to wait at Pinkham Notch for a while before trying to walk 4.8 miles to Osgood campsite. The rain completely stopped during the drive to Pinkham Notch and we even saw blue skies.  I waited for a while about an hour. A small line of dark clouds with some light drizzle came through. I found the first New Hampshire border geocache on my trek. I just couldn't wait around too long so I started up the trail.  The first mile was easy but then it started to rain, initially quite light but then in a downpour. By the time I got my rain jacket and rain cover on, I was already soaked. The rest of the trip to Osgood went fine and the rain stopped but it's always hard to tell exactly as drops fell from the trees for a while.  At Osgood, I talked with someone who works for the New York Philharmonic. He and his family were just heading out to make the long climb up Mount Madison. After finishing up my early lunch, I realized that what I had initially thought was a blister on my toe was actually a corn. The Leukotape combined with new shoes wasn't helping.  I used some more Leukotape to take off the pressure on that site and for the first time, I relaced my shoes removing the laces from the lowest set of eyelets (which I had read was good for bunions. I decided to hike up Mount Madison myself. While a bit higher, this climb was quite manageable and I never had to put my trekking poles away.  As I climbed, the wind started up, initially very calm, but then much stronger as I neared the top and I lost the windbreaks above tree line. One Northbounder said he had been hailed on at the top when it was raining below. At the top, the winds were terrible and it was harder to stay upright. I tried to take a video and simply turning around made me fall. I had at least two falls, bringing my total to about 7 (as there are different ways to determine a fall. I don't consider it a real fall if I  catch myself with my arms). I then made my way into the teeth of the wind the half mile to the Hut. There I reconnected with Turtleman (whom I had met down in Virginia). I also remet Dandelion, a woman from New Jersey who I had met hiking back from Pinkham Notch. I was able to get Work for Stay as only one other thru-hiker came in as the weather was so bad that most hikers didn't want to hike over Mount Washington (the next day I found out that they had recorded a wind gust of 95 mph today). Work for Stay is a program where Appalachian trail hikers are able to stay at the Huts, in exchange for helping with chores.  We had to wait until after all the Hut’s guests had eaten. Then we were served leftovers from prior dinners. The Hut guests were served Honey Mustard chicken while I had a choice of lasagna, enchiladas and pulled pork. The Hut needs to minimize their waste as most of their garbage has to be carried out by backpackers. I then had to wash dishes for about an hour using a system I used with the Boy Scouts. This was a bargain as I might have paid the $160 just to get out of those winds and to be warmer as the temperatures were certainly dropping. While I was doing dishes, our work was interrupted by the best sunset I've seen on the entire trail.  The sunset started when the sun dipped below the clouds and then became truly brilliant. I finished my chores and had to hang around for a little while until quiet hours (which started at 9:30 PM). I was then allowed to set up my sleeping pad and quilt on the floor. I went to sleep quickly.","Gorham, NH

I didn't hang around for breakfast as I wanted to get a decent start to the day and I still had an everything bagel purchased at Walmart back in Gorham. I thought about my oldest sister who would have turned 66 today.  The trail today was fairly nice again today. While it was certainly rocky, there were no sections where I was not able to use my trekking poles. I was able to skirt around the sides of several mountains which also made it easier. As a result, I made decent time and arrived at the summit of Mount Washington around 11. My fitness seems to vary, but I seem to be able to climb tall mountains fairly well. I only stopped to take pictures as I  didn't need to rest. At the top. I toured the summit and went to the snack bar. I ate a bowl of chili and had a Granny Smith apple and a Snickers bar. I purchased some wifi time so I could message my wife who is now in Iceland do regular texting doesn't work. I also uploaded some pictures to Facebook. I continued south. As the next Hut. I purchased some soup and found out what was necessary to log a virtual geocache as I had sat next to someone cachers from Nova Scotia.  I kept walking. On the way to the next Hut, I met Hard Knocks, whom I had met several times in Virginia (between Glasgow and my first day in the Shenandoahs). I recognized him first but he remembered my name before I recalled his. He even said that my name had come up one evening. I continued south. Shortly before I reached the Mitzpah Hut, I started talking to a weekend visitor from Rhode Island. As luck would have it, he happened to come from the same town as my freshmen year roommate at Cornell. He even knew my roommate's mother.  He had a reservation at the Hut but had decided to go home early. As a result, he offered to let me take his place as he had already paid for the room. As a result. I got another very nice supper and will be able to sleep in a bunk tonight. This is clearly the best trail magic I've had the entire trek, particularly because I had been getting worried about finding a place to camp on the Saturday of a holiday weekend. The accommodations were relatively rustic with 8 people in a room with 4 bunk beds and no electricity available to charge electronic devices.  I also had another day with over 10 miles on the trail, which is very hard to do in the White mountains. I have to say that I have been enjoying the White mountains more than I had been anticipating several days ago. The last several days were very eventful and quite nice.","

By the time I realized my mistake I had walked 0.3 miles so 0.6 should be added to today's total.  The early part of the day included a lot of treacherous downhill climbs which took more than a mile per hour. At the bottom, I was blessed to be treated to trail magic offered by 4 thru-hikers from 2017. I had some pasta salad,  cookies, and a beer. I was joined by Turtleman and Dandelion. When people started smoking (both tobacco and marijuana), I left a little early as I knew I had a large climb. The climb was significant but not overly difficult. After that I was blessed with a seven mile relatively flat stretch which felt so good to cover ground quickly.  During this section, I met Research, a clinical psychologist from Macon. GA whom I had hiked with in Virginia. I was amazed at how many Northbounders passed me as there was even one pack of nearly 20 young thru-hikers. I reached the Zealand Hut and inquired about camping or Work for Stay and was surprised to be allowed Work for Stay again.  I guess the larger groups don't even ask as this Hut only accepts two thru-hikers daily. This time I was fed the regular meal which was large stuffed shells with meat sauce and sourdough bread. Here I talked to a Boy Scout troop from New Jersey. I also met a woman who was hiking Hut to Hut whom had been a guest at Woods Hole hostel when I had stayed there.  In fact, her husband drove me into Pearisburg while she hiked that section. The other work for stay hiker was Pancho who was from Boston. We carried on a lively conversation while we worked, scouring black spots off some baking pans. Rather than sleeping on the floor, the two of us slept on the porch outside as there weren't any bugs and both of us weren't interested in waiting around for breakfast as we wanted to get an early start to the day.  This turned out to be another fun day.

I got a Nacho plate and a beer and a former thru-hiker picked up the tab. I debated about doing the slackpack and eventually decided to take advantage of this opportunity.

The hostel owner warned me it would be a difficult day but certainly not impossible.  After talking with several hikers who had done this yesterday I decided to try this but even this morning I almost canceled. There was a strong allure to take a light day, go to the post office and send home some gear (particularly much of my extra warm clothing and downgrading my battery from a 20,000 mah to a 10,000 mah model) for significant weight savings.  I also yearned for a day to sit in a movie theater, watch several movies and eat a lot of popcorn. Alas, not today.
I started out and immediately could tell that the terrain was easier.  I climbed over Mount Wolf still averaging more than 2 miles per hour. The vaunted climb up South Kinsman seemed easy for me. I don't know whether I have just become a stronger hiker or the Northbounders simply hadn't seen any real mountains yet. Certainly the biggest difference was that I didn't have to put away my hiking poles and was able to use them both climbing up and down both Kinsman mountains.  Rarely I could let the poles hang from my wrists while I grasped at a rock or a tree branch for the few steep sections. I met and passed one Northbounder from Georgia who was downright unfriendly. He complained that he hated to camp with people and he was running out of money. At North Kinsman, his demeanor changed completely when he met two dayhiking women. I suspect he was trying to beg for money or food.  He was one of the few hikers I simply didn't feel comfortable around. I had some lentil soup at my last White Mountain Hut. Lonesome Lake was beautiful. I made it back to the shuttle pickup area with enough time to get some food from the snack bar. I then talked with another guest at the hostel who was a student from Israel. Back at the hostel, I was able to meet the famous Crawford family who had just arrived.  They are a family of nine who are hiking the entire trail together. There had been some controversy over them early on as someone had reported them to Children and Protective Services. The kids seemed happy, particularly the baby who was running around exploring everything. I was able to get the hostel to mail my box back home. Because the weather was forecasted to be nice. I really didn't want to take a rest day so I decided to head out early the next day.  Mount Moussilake will be my first target. After climbing that mountain, I will be finished with the Whites!

I could tell immediately that I was struggling as the trail immediately started upwards.  I slogged up Mount Moussilake. Perhaps I had such an easy day yesterday because of slackpacking, or perhaps I was fresher yesterday after having hiked a relatively short day the day before.  I couldn't even tell that my pack was lighter after sending several pounds of gear home (although I am still carrying too much food). I've still been listening to Audible. I recently finished reading two fantasy novels by Terry Brooks who is one of my favorite fantasy writers.  I also just read “The Tao of Pooh"" which describes some eastern philosophy through examples from Winnie the Pooh. (I’m not sure the author achieved his goals). I,’m currently listening to “The Testament of Mary"" which describes some of the gospel stories through her eyes. I don't quite understand the point of the book so far, but I’ve been enjoying the reading done by Meryl Streep.  These last two books were daily specials offered by Audible for only a few dollars.
At the top  I met a family and talked with them for a while.  I found out that the mother and son were both Cornellians and the father had attended the University of Wisconsin.  The trail down Mount Moussilake seemed to go on forever. I had another fall (and I realized that I’ve been falling nearly every day in the White Mountains that I stopped counting).  Fortunately none of the recent falls had any injuries. As the trail descended. I was able to see the woods transition into a beach forest. The trail became far gentler and I was able to walk on packed dirt for long periods.  I eventually hiked over 16 miles today. I met another Northbounder whom I had met before. He was from Lancaster, PA and we had shared a night at Bears Den hostel. I had heard about the Omelet Man but didn't think I could make it to him on time.  Instead I walked a little off trail to a great little restaurant where I had a nice meal and a beer. 
I was also just contacted by Grumpy.  He sounds like he is back on trail. We may even be able to meet up this weekend in Hanover.  I will probably push myself a little tomorrow now that the trail is easing up a bit to both get into Hanover a bit sooner and to try to miss some of the rain expected on Saturday.  I haven't taken a zero in more than a week, partially because the weather has been generally favorable. 
My guest book was visited by someone who appeared offended by my musings.  I am writing here for both myself as well as other future hikers who may be planning a trip like this themselves.  I am trying to honestly portray what I am going through. It should be somewhat obvious that I am probably going through the mental stages of a thru-hike right now.  Rather than using chemicals such as tobacco and marijuana to make themselves feel better and mask these feelings, I am trying to process my own thoughts honestly. Readers do not have to agree with me and are entitled to their own opinions.  I usually just write in the evening. I recently passed a southbounder who writes in his journal for extended periods every day. He reported that he had seen 6 moose as the long quiet periods get them to walk along the trail. Different people process things differently.  Both my writing style and hiking decisions are my own. Hike your own hike!

I  got going reasonably early. I quickly passed Mr. Omelet who has a semi-permanent station in the woods. I had been hearing lots of stories from Northbounders about him.  Unfortunately he wasn't open when I went by. I did take a little water and a banana. I'm really surprised that he left bananas unattended in Bear country. I had two 2000 foot climbs today.  The first one was harder than the second. Except for meeting a single dayhiker on the top of the first mountain, everyone else I met today was a Northbounder. I finished up the Mary book I had started yesterday and today I started,  “The Handmaid's Tale “ which I've heard a lot about. I wonder if she had attended the University of Iowa Creative Writing Workshop as Iowa was mentioned. Yesterday I met someone who just graduated from the University of Connecticut who will be starting graduate school at the Creative Writing Workshop in Iowa himself.  The forest seems much darker now, probably because of the emergence of Beech trees. I discovered my first wild raspberries but was a bit disappointed that they didn't seem to have much flavor. I had hoped to do a 20 mile day. I struggled up the last hillside to the campsite. 19.5 miles is still my longest day since the 100 mile wilderness.  I am now only 15 miles away from Hanover and hope to meet Grumpy tomorrow.
However one other event dominated my day.  While hiking I noticed some fullness in my left groin.  When I pushed the area, it bubbled. I seem to have popped out a hernia.  Unless I touched it, there was no pain. I did seem a bit gassier but was still able to eat without difficulty.  I had a hernia on this side repaired 2 ½ years ago. While I know that hernia repairs often break down after age 40, I was a bit surprised that mine recurred so soon.  I was still able to hike another 8 miles today so I may be able to continue, but I am very worried that I may have to have another surgery. If this causes me more symptoms,  this may even take me off trail for several weeks. I even considered whether God was encouraging me to go off trail to pursue a career out here, but realized this happened going into a weekend. I called my sister to discuss options with her but didn't want to bother my wife as she only has a few days left on her European vacation.  At this point.

I had some similar accumulation for weeks after the surgery.  I also recall that when I was coming down off of Mount Moussilauke, I fell and did a front to back banana split. I now believe I probably tore something around the stitches.  The swelling from the scar has also become more noticeable as I have lost a significant amount of weight. The only thing that makes me still concerned about a hernia is that when I was hiking today,  several times I thought I felt gas moving around the area. As a result, I am still worried that I will be developing a hernia in the future, but that I don't have one now.
The day was generally easy.  Rather than being awoken by Veeries, this morning a pair of robins woke me with their singing. I finally got my food weight down to carrying only about a day and a half of extra food.  One of the hills I had to climb still was tedious but overall it was a light day. I did have to face a new challenge as water is starting to become scarce. Consecutive shelters today did not have any water.  This is partially due to the extended period of limited rain that has made my hiking easier. I also heard of a few dry shelters in Vermont. I know that this will also be a problem in the mid-Atlantic states. I  made reasonably good time as Grumpy wanted to meet around 4 PM. I made it into Hanover around 2 PM. I thought I was in the territory of an enemy when I was hiking on the Dartmouth athletics fields. I even saw the football team practicing.  I got some food at the first place that sold it, the Co-Op. I had a very nice chickpea salad and a large buffalo chicken breast. I washed this all down with two 20 oz. Diet Dr. Pepper and a diet raspberry tea Snapple. As I still had a fair amount of time,  I walked over the bridge into Vermont, another state finished! I walked under the Interstate and up the road into Norwich. There I found the Norwich Inn which is also a microbrewery. This seemed to be a good place to wait, particularly as it had started to rain a bit.  Grumpy and his wife picked me up, we drove to White River Junction and got our hotel rooms. After showering and starting laundry, we went out to dinner. This was a lot of fun and the conversation never lagged. Grumpy had only gotten back on the trail about 8 days ago but he had been able to nearly finish Vermont during that time.  They also took me to a grocery store where I was able to resupply and again bought too much food. 
This was overall a great day.  Finishing up another state and seeing Grumpy was also accompanied by a record number of steps done in a week (over 300,000) and flights of stairs  (over 3,000 ). As Grumpy would be able to drop me back off on the trail and because the weather was supposed to be nice (but very hot), I decided to hike out the next day.","Trapper John Shelter

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597478,"The night’s stay in a hotel was luxurious.  After waking, we ate downstairs. I enjoyed some cold cereal and milk which is a luxury on the trail.  There was an Episcopal church nearby to where I had stopped the day before. They had a guest minister but my presence increased the size of the congregation to three. The  service was therefore a bit informal and I was even asked to do the readings. I also was able to talk to the minister after the service.
After services,  I was able to start hiking.  Including the section in Hanover,  this is the longest road walk. There were a few coolers with trail magic,  but I had a full backpack and a full stomach. The trail was again very reasonable but I was clearly not used to the heat.  Several miles in I met Grumpy and we talked for potentially the last time, although if he has no further health problems, he might meet me again in Atkins. Initially I made decent progress but then my pace lagged.  I then was the first person who discovered an ice cold case of Budweiser. Since I was going uphill and the beers were so cold, I imbibed. Then when I was considering stopping for the night, I found the shelter didn't have water.  Therefore I walked another 4 miles to get to water and I was able to find a spot to camp near a road. Except for the heat which I anticipate will be getting worse as I head south, today was another good day.","Norwich, VT

I was on the trail by 5:10 which was before sunrise to hike as much as I could before the heat of the day. Once again I made quick progress but then lagged as the temperatures rose.  I passed by a landmark called The Lookout. It is privately owned but the owner doesn't mind AT hikers using the facilities. The best part was an observatory on top of the roof which gave some nice views. After I had hiked 11 miles today I had a minimal celebration as this marked finishing one thousand miles.  I finished my last book and started another short one, Why Do Care What Other People Think? This was written by a Caltech physicist who taught for several years at Cornell. The part about the space shuttle disaster was interesting but again this book was fairly forgettable (whike I had definitely liked the Handmaid's Tale which was an early dystopian novel talking about abuses done by a future right wing sect. I had hoped to hike 20 miles today but I again started dragging. When I reached the Stony Brook Shelter I felt I had to stop (as this is also the name of my medical school alma mater.  Rain is expected all day tomorrow. I hope to hike 10 miles in the morning and then take a bus into Rutland, VT where there is a very nice hostel (although it is operated by the Twelve Tribes religious sect). I heard that they won't try to convert people as old as I am. Besides the heat, the only other problem was a container of pepperoni slices which didn't need to be refrigerated until after it was opened. This container must have sprang a leak so that day’s food was coated with oil from the pepperoni. I also never had cell phone service whenever I checked. My wife should be returning home from her trip and it would be nice to talk to her.","Pomfret Road

I got in about two miles before it started raining.  I got a little nervous when I was at the top of a mountain and I heard thunder but it never got very windy and the rain stayed light. I reached the intersection of where the Appalachian trail joins up with the Long trail.  I just missed the bus but was quickly able to get a hitch into Rutland. The Yellow Deli hostel seems nice but was very busy as I'm heading into the NoBo bubble. After showering, doing laundry and checking in with my wife,  I got a late lunch and then went to a movie theater. I got a medium popcorn as well as some chocolate candy (which can't really be carried on the trail as it melts too easily). I enjoyed watching The Incredibles 2. After that I had dinner.  I met up with another mature SoBo hiker, Colorado, but it sounds like he is a loner and wasn't interested in hiking together. I also connected with friends from Manchester. We've made plans for me to meet up this Friday afternoon. I also bunked with a young hiker who is only doing the Long trail who just graduated from MIT.","Stony Brook Shelter

The plan was to slackpack 17 miles using the Rutland bus system.  Breakfast was a vegetarian meal with rice and tofu but was very good. We caught the bus and made our way to the trailhead. The bus was completely full with at least half of the seats taken by hikers.  We started hiking. The trail up Killington mountain was moderately difficult but without the added weight of a full backpack, combined with markedly lower temperatures and humidity, I made the climb fairly quickly and easily.  At the top, I continued off trail to the summit and then went down the other side to the lodge where I purchased a few snacks. The rest of the day was relatively uneventful. When I got back to the next trailhead, I went back to town.  We stopped at Dick’s Sporting Goods hoping to possibly buy some Keen trailrunners as the current pair of Merrill's is starting to break down already and isn't really my size. I did have two minor falls today. The current plan is to get up early tomorrow and have a reasonably big day to make Friday much easier into Manchester.  I also anticipate meeting Bruce Matson tomorrow who stars on one of the Mighty Blue podcasts.","Rutland, VT

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597797,"I thought I had set my alarm for 4 am.  Fortunately there were far fewer people staying at the hostel so I had my little room to myself.  I also found a fan to help cover street noise and improve ventilation. I still only slept fitfully.  My alarm failed to go off when I had thought I had set it for. As a result I initially missed both the bus and my planned breakfast.  I went back to the hostel and had breakfast and then went back to the bus station. We caught a different bus more than an hour later which went near but not by the trailhead.  We were dropped off about a mile and a half away. Fortunately we were picked up nearly immediately by someone who drove us directly to the trail. I set off up the trail. Around mid-morning,  I came upon a group of hikers, with an ill hiker. I did a brief exam, saw a young male in overall good health. His pulse was strong and at a normal rate. His skin was dry and his pupils were mid-position. Unfortunately he was quite confused.  Questions seemed to confuse him even worse. I only got him to say Pittsburgh. The other hikers had already called for an ambulance. Because two of them were a nurse and an EMT, and because he was able to walk, I discussed my concerns with the EMT who was also suspicious that he was overdosing on some sort of mood-altering substance.  They continued on down the trail but I kept going as I could even hear the ambulance arriving at the bottom of the hill. Later that morning, I met Bruce Matson (RTK), who is the featured guest on the Returning to Katahdin podcast. We talked for a while but were obviously heading in different directions. Mid-afternoon I ran into some trail magic and had an ice cream, a banana,  a Gatorade, a snack cake and a beer. There were a lot of hikers there as I am getting closer and closer to the bubble. I eventually stopped a little before 5 having covered more than half of the remaining distance to Manchester where I will meet a friend tomorrow.","Rutland, VT

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597852,"The night was quiet and actually got a little nippy.  While I had sent back most of my cold weather gear, I still have my insulated ground pad, a Sea to Summit thermal reactor sleeping pad liner (which I have used all along and now sometimes only this), and my 10 degree Enlightened Equipment Enigma quilt.  This night I actually used the footbox but I didn't have to tighten up any straps. I prefer to sleep relatively warmly even though this may be a bit too warm. I also have kept my inflatable pillow and will often use a hat. This system has a lot of ability to keep me warm but is flexible to varying weather conditions.  The liner is always used as this is a good way to keep odors from permeating my quilt.
I set my alarm back to 4:15 as sunrise has been getting later as the days are slightly shorter,  but more importantly due to steadily moving south and west. I got an early start and I arrived in Manchester early afternoon.  While I usually carry two liters of water (I know that some people only carry a single liter but the extra two pounds gives me more flexibility if there isn't a water source,  if the water source is not appealing, and allows me to not have to stop to get my filter out so often. Knowing I was going into town, I was completely dry for the last several miles.  Bromley ski area was beautiful and I took a nice break there. I met my friend and we were able to get some beverages and stop at the local outfitters. I then stopped at a shoe store and was able to get a new pair of Keen trailrunners.  I could tell they were much more comfortable immediately. I took my friend out to dinner and we talked a lot. He had thru-hiked the Long trail last month and is talking about thru-hiking the Appalachian trail in 2020. It was fun talking so much as I have found I don't get to talk as much with so many younger hikers.  I will be staying an additional night as my friend agreed to slackpack me tomorrow for 17.5 miles. I also crossed a minor milestone as I have now hiked more of the Appalachian trail in this segment than I had done between Virginia and Pennsylvania.","Lost Pond shelter

Once again, I am amazed at how much easier it is to slackpack than to carry a normal backpack.  As today was Saturday and the weather was good, there were lots of day hikers on the trail. Also making the trail easier was my new book: Pandemic, the Extinction Files by AJ Riddle.  My new trailrunners, while generally much more comfortable than the last pair, seemed to be a bit tight in the toes, particularly my slightly larger right foot. When I got back I was able to borrow a toenail clipper.  Hopefully that and breaking in the new shoes should hopefully dramatically improve the issues with my feet. I've been working on trimming down the callous around my corn and that problem has definitely been improving. The  17 mile slackpack went by quickly. When we got back, I was treated to a home cooked meal including the first sweet corn of the season. I also was able to go into town for some resupply.

It generally lightly rained all morning.  At Kid Gore shelter I took a lunch break. This shelter was in a valley which concentrated the wind such that it blew directly into the shelter and was quite chilly.  I had to put on my rain jacket and get moving again to get warm again. I had initially planned to stop at Goddard shelter but after stopping and filtering water, it seemed to be a bit early to stop for the day,  particularly when I had a weak internet signal and saw the radar which indicated no further rain for the afternoon. I hiked a bit more than 3 additional miles until I found a beautiful stealth spot closer to 5 PM. In addition,  those three miles allowed me to go over the 1100 mile mark which means that I have now completed just over half of the Appalachian trail.

In fact it rained relatively hard nearly all day except for the hour around lunch when I tried to dry out in a shelter.  The sun even came out then so I set out again as I really wanted to get to Massachusetts tomorrow. However the hardest rains of the day started then. Since my shoes and socks were already soaked,  I simply slogged through deep puddles (relatively flat areas) or streams (practically every slanted area. This was clearly the heaviest rain I've hiked in. While I had my rain cover on, my backpack was soaked.  Even my sleeping quilt had gotten a bit wet.

I had to eat breakfast at the edge of my tent inside the vestibule. I finally started out with the enticement of a dry room and some good food.  The trail was still quite wet. While the terrain was generally downhill, because of the moisture, it was slippery. My toes were really hurting probably because the shoes were swollen from the rain.

Right away I faced a significant climb.  Mount Greylock is the highest peak in Massachusetts. I eventually hiked to the top (which was harder than it usually is because most of the trail was waterlogged). At the top it began to rain heavier.  I explored the War Memorial on the top and then because of the rain, I went into the lodge and ordered lunch (even though I had packed in a six inch Subway sandwich).

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599284,"For the second night,  I was the hostel’s only guest.  This is truly surprising because the owner reported she would have 8 guests tonight.  I was unsure about the hostel’s outdoor shower as the water simply fell onto the ground and then would have quickly reached the stream which flows through the hostel owner's property.  
I started hiking shortly after 8:30. The terrain was not difficult most of the day.  The terrain seemed to change a bit simply crossing the state line. Sunny areas had extremely thick undergrowth (particularly with a lot more reed canary grass. However in shaded areas the undergrowth was quite sparse in some areas.  There were a lot of stone walls. When I reached the area around Pawling, my memories had been altered a bit as I had hiked a 5-6 mile stretch of the trail back in 2015 (the only part of the trail I had ever been on). A beautiful stealth camping site was actually quite small. A stream I crossed over was about half the size I had recalled.  I had hoped to sign the log book at Telephone Pioneer Shelter as I had signed it three years ago, but there was no log to sign. At Pawling, I met one of my wife's cousins who took me out to lunch. This was very nice and I ended up eating half of her meal. I got back on trail and enjoyed the walk around Nuclear lake.  While the weather was partly cloudy, just before I got to the trailhead to meet my sister, a large thunderstorm came through and completely drenched me. When I got to her home, after stopping at a grocery store, I demolished an entire rotisserie chicken as well as 4 ears of corn on the cob, and an entire large plastic container of Arugula.  It was nice having clean and dry clothes again! Tomorrow will be a rest day which works out well as it's expected to rain all day. I will also get the chance to reconnect with two other siblings and get some new gear (particularly a new Thermarest NeoAir XLite sleeping pad).","Kent, CT

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599529,"Today was a rest day.  After a large breakfast,  I was driven to the local barber. I had had a short haircut in March so it wasn't essential for me to get one when I was home in early May.  However with another three months of growth I was getting downright shaggy. It was hot and took a long time to dry. At the same time I wanted to maintain enough hair to help prevent insect bites (particularly around the base of my neck). When I told the stylist what I wanted,  she was a bit aghast. When I told her why, she went to work. Meanwhile the conversation had been overheard. I became a bit of a celebrity and spent the entire time answering questions from other stylists as well as other clients. When she was finished (including trimming my eyebrows which were rubbing against the front of my eyeglasses making them harder to keep clean,  and trimming a little bit of my beard around my mouth), she made a comment that she hoped I enjoyed the worst haircut she had ever done in her career.
When we went back home,  two of my other siblings also came to visit for the day considering I was in town.  I got my new ground pad (going back to the Thermarest Neoair which I had liked better than the Big Agnes premium one). I also got another set of Injinji trail socks.  I had preemptively replaced a pair of the grey ones with a pair of green ones and two of the four green socks had developed holes within 200 miles while neither pair of the grey ones had developed a hole in them in spite of hiking in them for over 500 miles.  I also got a new shirt. This one came in this quarter’s Obsidian Cairn collection 
 It was long sleeved with a collar which is different from the tees I had been wearing.  However the most important feature of the shirt is that it had been treated with Insectshield technology,  essentially bonding permethrin to the fibers and the protection is good for 70 washes. I also got a lighter pair of camp shoes,  replacing my Crocs with something I had heard about from Bruce Matson on his podcast. I also received some food and the parts of AWOL which I needed to get me to southern Pennsylvania.  This was about half the weight of what I sent back home so I am definitely getting closer. It was nice to have a rest day, catch up with my siblings and eat a lot of good food. 
I also weighed myself.  I am now down 26 pounds and 5 inches on my waist.  I would still like to lose perhaps another 10 pounds so I don't need to liberalise my diet much at this point.

I don't think she liked getting up that early but because of the Heat Advisory,  she recognized that I wanted to hike during the cool of the day. The day was relatively easy. Perhaps it was the rest day or gentler terrain (although I still climbed the equivalent of 570 flights of stairs which would be a big day). It may also have been hiking in somewhat familiar territory.  I crossed Interstate 84 and then the Taconic Parkway which goes directly through the town I grew up in. I met a new southbounder. Kayo had just started a section hike from Pawling, NY and is hoping to get to Front Royal in three weeks when he will have to go back to his job as a special education teacher in Richmond,  VA. I eventually ended up hiking 23 miles which is the longest I have hiked since the first part of my hike. I got my first bee sting while urinating just off the trail.

The only two items of note is that I really like the Neoair much better than the Big Agnes ground pad.  It's more comfortable. It was also the first night in which I was serenaded by some sort of a insect, possibly locusts or perhaps cicadas as they didn't sound like regular locusts.  While the bee sting hadn't bothered me much during the day, during the middle of the night my arm really started to ache. In the morning I set out by 6:15. After several miles I was able to get a nice lunch at a convenience store practically right on the trail.  It took longer to get to the Hudson river from there than I had initially expected but I was able to cross easily. I walked into the Bear Mountain Zoo and explored the place. It's not a particularly good zoo, mostly emphasizing New York animals. The place was packed as most people came for the public swimming pool as well as a small lake which also had swimming as well as paddleboard rentals.  I had another snack here then started the climb up Bear Mountain. The climb was fairly easy, mostly because the entire ascent was a demonstration of trailbuilding with some excellent old stone work. Almost to the top, I took a small detour and found a geocache for New York. I then walked to the top and climbed the tower. Unfortunately because the day was very hot and there was a lot of haze, it was not possible to see the New York City skyline.  I finally ended up another 0.4 miles down the trail where Guthooks had alerted me of a camping site. I had a great view of the Hudson north of the mountain.","Campground off of Dennytown Road

This was a couple and their dog who had left back on May 2nd, before the trails on Mount Katahdin had even opened.  I generally enjoyed the day as most of the New York forests were very open with not much undergrowth. I crossed through the Lemon Squeezer and was barely able to complete this without taking off my pack (although I was continuously hitting both sides of the passage.  I was glad I had lost weight. After that I crossed over the New York Thruway and then Route 17. This latter one was somewhat melancholic for me as I had driven along this Highway many times whenever I went to Cornell. I won't be able to revisit those halcyon days. I had heard that the climb up the mountain after Route 17 was particularly difficult but again,  after having already traversed through New Hampshire, nothing was super difficult. The morning had been clear, but it had started raining after the Lemon Squeezer. The rain had stopped but I was racing to finish the climb before the next batch of thunderstorms. I eventually found a stealth site just before the summit of Alden Mountain. I also received an email from Odie,  the owner of the Hiker Yearbook. I had met him back in April. I had submitted the photo of my shadow taken back in New Hampshire and it sounded like he really liked it.","Stealth site - 789.2

However there was enough condensation already on the inside of my tent that every time the wind blew and a few drops fell onto my tent which dislodged droplets of water from the accumulated condensation.  I was then able to open the door flaps to get a little ventilation and the night passed uneventfully. In the morning I heard my first whipporwhil since Virginia but this was for only a brief time. I had had signal at my campsite and I had fallen asleep before I put my phone back to airplane mode.  In the morning I found that my auxiliary power pack was completely drained and I only had 39% battery life left. As a result I didn't listen to Audible all day 
 I had a relatively light day scheduled as I planned to stay in Greenwood Lake for the night.  The owner of Anton’s had said he could pick me up at 17A, but that would only account for a 10 mile day. I initially passed by several beaver ponds and heard a beaver slap his tail twice.  I got lost after Fitzgerald Falls as the trail was poorly blazed around this segment. I stopped at the summit of a rocky summit and dried out my tent. While I was doing this I met KiwiLegs again.  When I got to 17A, I decided to keep going for several reasons. First, it allowed me to go another several miles and get closer to New Jersey. Second, the weather was holding out as the weather was no longer forecasted to rain until evening.  Third, this allowed me to stop for lunch at a hot dog stand and then eat some very good ice cream. Finally, if I needed to get dropped back to the trail, I wouldn't be able to start hiking until 8:30 the next day which was supposed to be a good day. 
The last several miles of the trail were incredibly easy as the trail was practically flat and rock free. The side trail headed directly into town but was a steep downhill.  When I got into town I stopped at an Irish pub and then at a grocery store to resupply. I made it to the Motel and showered and did laundry. I went to a different Irish restaurant for supper and then went to bed.  The plan is to reach New Jersey tomorrow evening.","

I called my wife and realized I just seemed to be somewhat dragging slowly today.  I had a great stop at a wonderful overlook and then stopped at another hot dog stand and ice cream shop. I traversed the longest boardwalk of the trail. I then had two bears come running as a larger one (300 lbs) was chasing a smaller one (150 lbs?). Except for the bear at the Bear Mountain Zoo,  this was my first bear sighting. By the time I had quit, I realized I had hiked 19.5 miles. This was a decent day, particularly because my wife told me that she didn't want to come pick me up until after she had dropped off both kids at college (particularly because she didn't want to miss spending time with my son who has been away most of the summer working as a Boy Scout Camp Counselor). I am definitely past the bubble as I only saw a few northbounders today.  I celebrated my 100th day on the trail today. I've finished 1367 miles.

I had a downhill which was punctuated by getting water out of an abandoned house.  Apparently the National Park Service now owns the home and they are keeping the house for the moment with its outdoor spigot.  I then walked on a boardwalk through a swamp, then did a long flat section on dikes surrounding a waterfowl refuge and then on some roads (briefly back in New York). I then stopped in at the Secret Shelter (an unofficial one owned by a former thru-hiker). My primary reason for stopping was to use the privy, but then seeing it was a comfortable place away from the new hordes of mosquitoes,  I decided to take a longer break to eat some food and try to dry out my shoes and socks (which had gotten soaked again from walking in the dew soaked grass around the refuge). While I was eating a snack, the owner drove up, ostensibly to do some weed whacking. However he immediately came over and we started up a conversation. He had hiked the trail at the age of 51 back in 1989. He's now 80, but continues to do some hiking.  He showed me his Katahdin summit photo and encouraged me to consider hiking in Europe, particularly a trail that runs from the Netherlands to Italy. He also had some medical questions which I tried to help him with. We talked for more than an hour, but if I hadn't had plans to do more miles, he could have talked for a lot longer, and he even offered to drive me into town. He clearly loves having his unofficial shelter as he gets to talk to lots of nice people every summer.  He also said that I am now past the bubble (although I did meet a group of three thru-hikers). I then climbed to High Point state park which is the highest peak in New Jersey. At the bottom of the hill, I was able to get a free Pepsi donated by Friends of High Point state park. I then was able to find a New Jersey geocache leaving me needing to find caches in 4 more states. Like I was warned, after High Point state park, the trail became much rockier, and apparently will stay that way through Dungannon,  PA. Rather than camping at Rutherford shelter (which I was warned not to do because it's in a swamp where the mosquitoes are probably worse), I found a beautiful campsite overlooking a view at the top of the ridge above that shelter. While I was cooking my supper, I feel I made the right choice as I could hear loud singing coming from the shelter below. I also felt more comfortable doing this after the staff at the state park office reassured me that they were unaware of any problem bears.

They all were confident they would be able to finish but one hiker intimated that there were several groups of party hikers further ahead at Delaware Water Gap. They tend to stay at donation based hostels and then hitchhike their way to the next party spot rather than hiking.  I will try not to stay at that hostel.

When I got to the center, I quickly purchased lunch as well as did some resupply of items not possibly available in a grocery store.  I met a delightful southbounder who was hiking the trail with two of his kids. He was originally from Ireland but became a pharmacist and now lives in Baltimore (where his wife is a medical oncologist who specializes in breast cancer).

As soon as I got to the first parking area I saw a port-a-potty. I then saw two other restrooms along the trail which were part of the Delaware Water Gap park system. Crossing Interstate 80 was memorable for me as I remembered driving over this section of Interstate 80 whenever I would take a Greyhound bus to or from Cornell.  Further west, I drove on Interstate 80 many times as it goes through Iowa City and further west it goes through Lincoln, NE where one of my groomsmen lives who introduced my wife to me. Crossing into Pennsylvania was significant in that I have now finished backpacking 9 of the 14 states of the Appalachian trail.

Because tomorrow is also forecasted to have heavy rain,  I will probably take a zero tomorrow as I am more inclined to hike bigger miles on better weather days.  I also don't want to risk slipping and falling on wet Pennsylvania rocks as long as I have the luxury of only needing to average 11 miles daily.","Mohican Outdoor Center

I had my final great meal at the hostel and got a shuttle to the trail.  While hiking, I caught up with KiwiLegs with whom I've been leapfrogging since Williamstown,  MA. She had a friend from Oregon who is hiking with her but has probably slowed her down. At the first overlook,  I was able to see my first copperheads. There were actually three of them sunning themselves. There was also a large group of Amish there. The group consisted of two adult men and about 15 kids. I spoke with the adults for a while as they weren't shy at all. In fact,  when they found out I was a physician they tried to recruit me. Apparently this part of Pennsylvania has a rapidly growing Amish population as many of them are moving away from Lancaster, PA because property values became too high. Later I saw another small snake. Shortly after Swatara Gap I encountered two areas of flooding.  As I approached the first, I saw a large 3-4 foot Northern Water Snake drop down from about 8 feet up in a tree and then scooted into the water. I took off my hiking shoes and put on my camp shoes and made the crossing with water about as high as my calf. Later on there was another flooded part of the trail caused by a long beaver dam. At this point my shoes and socks were saturated anyway so I didn't bother switching shoes when I crossed this section.  It rained briefly twice today but tomorrow is expected to be delightful. Apparently the rocks are supposed to end around Duncannon which is only a little more than 20 miles away. The other minor milestone was going over 1000 miles from Mount Katahdin.","Route 645

I did see one deer. The night was the first cool one in weeks.  I didn't need my sleeping bag but I did put on a hat as well as my puffy jacket to keep warm. I had to hike the first 6 ½ miles without any water (although I had drunk my remaining fluids of about a liter before I set out). The terrain was a bit less muddy today but it had become more rocky again.  At one lookout (clued in by reports on Guthooks), I found a rattlesnake. I got a few pictures. It wasn't as large as the one I had seen in Massachusetts, but it was definitely a big one with 8 layers of rattles. I then realized there was also a copperhead practically touching the other snake. I called my wife and then a local came by. He actually jumped down to the ledge two feet below me  and told me there was a second copperhead directly underneath me. If I had done the natural act of simply hanging my legs off the rock I was sitting on, several of the snakes could have bit me. The weather was glorious and even though I had a decent pace, I wasn't drenched in sweat. While I didn't have to hike more than 10 miles, I ended up hiking 19. My goal for tomorrow is to get into Duncannon around lunch. I will need to do some resupplying and hopefully get a decent lunch.  The owner of the Rock and Sole hostel had warned me not to stay in Duncannon because there is a big drug problem (particularly methamphetamine) in that town. With a little food, I should be able to hold out until Boiling Springs for my next indoor sleeping.","Yellow Springs campsite

In the morning the view south towards the Susquehanna river was completely different.  There was a thick blanket of fog in the lowlands but it was perfectly clear above. I leisurely made the hike into Duncannon. At 11 am, I was able to eat lunch. I ate an entire 12 inch pepperoni pizza as well as a salad and two beers before heading back out on the trail.  I was able to do a limited resupply. The rest of the day was reasonably uneventful. I hiked a bit farther than I had been expecting but part of this was related to enjoying my current Audible book, another old Michael Crichton novel, Congo. I made it to the Darlington shelter even though my goal had been a campsite before this,  but I simply missed the site. At the shelter, there were two men who were section hiking all of Pennsylvania. One of them was a veterinarian and he peppered me with questions about gear. I realized that I really haven't been thinking about gear any longer but I recognized when I was at that stage. At this point my plan is to get to Boiling Springs tomorrow and to stay at either a hotel or possibly a new hostel.  There have certainly still been rocks today but I am supposed to have 9 flat miles tomorrow mostly through farm fields.

Also, there were some horses on the property which neighed periodically.  A rooster started crowing around 3 in the morning. I eventually got up, went to the bathroom and put on bug spray and then slept okay for the last several hours.  In the morning I was dropped off by the 101 caffe caffe where I had a large breakfast. I then decided to research going to church. As luck would have it, there was an ELCA Lutheran church fairly close. I only had to wait for a half hour until services started.  The congregation seemed vibrant with a number of children. The first call minister was friendly. He wasn't the most dynamic speaker but he had a great message about how bread and the Bible were similar. They both have to be internalized to get any benefit and the benefits are usually only for the person consuming it. I  then started hiking. I finished up the last of the flat valley section before having to climb back up into the hills. Because of the late start, I wasn't sure if I would be able to get to Pine Grove Furnace State park where there was another hostel. The terrain had a few rocky sections. However it was generally easy hiking.  I was able to hike at 3 miles per hour for the afternoon (partially having my mind engaged with listening to the 5th Stieg Larsson novel “The Girl who took an Eye for an Eye"". I actually made it to the State park before the food area closed. I decided to just do a modified Half Gallon Challenge by consuming 1.5 quarts of Raspberry ice cream.  I then went to the hostel. This is a fantastic place with lots of history. The building is historic but is now owned by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. I had the place to myself. I ate an entire frozen pizza and went to bed after taking advantage of the wifi (my son used up nearly our family's entire monthly date allotment so I won't be posting unless I have wifi until the next cycle starts in a little more than a week).

I only had 20 miles of hiking to get to Fayetteville so I decided to take an easy day to avoid having to spend an extra day without activity waiting for my wife.  The terrain was hillier than I have seen for a while but the real problem was the heat as the dew point was around 75 which is tropical. I passed the halfway points of the trail. I spoke to a family from Illinois and eventually decided to not stay at the Trail of Hope hostel (where I had had a bad experience months ago) as I heard they still didn't have air conditioning or wifi.  I booked myself at a hotel closer to I-81 for only about $50 per day which included breakfast. There was also a better selection of restaurants nearby. After hiking about 14 miles, I stopped at a campsite and heard thunder. I quickly set up my tent and lay inside for the duration of the quick storm which didn't produce any wind and only light rain.

I was very proud of myself when I reached Highway 30 which is where I had ended my hike in the spring.  The walk into town seemed much shorter than I had remembered.

I then used Uber for the first time in my life to get to the hotel.  My wife was dropping my daughter off at college.

I caught up with the Returning to Katahdin podcast. I did some reading.  I would usually go out for dinner and twice I walked more than a mile to the restaurant (the Roy Pitts Brewery was excellent!). On September 1st,  I checked out of my hotel but remained in the hotel lobby until my wife was able to pick me up around 6. I enjoyed listening to the Iowa Hawkeyes defeat Northern Illinois in football to start off the season.  That evening we headed up to near Harrisburg to meet one of my wife's friends from a church she belonged to 31 years ago. The dinner was nice. The next day we drove to Gettysburg and spent much of the day there.  I had never been there and my wife had only been there during an 8th grade trip to Washington DC. This was a very nice day. The next day we toured Harper's Ferry in the morning (although we didn't have time to stop at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy). We then drove into Virginia and drove through the Shenandoahs.  When we arrived at Bootens Gap, I got out of the car and hiked to Swift Run Gap to make up the gap I missed hiking when I ran into the trail devil who agreed to drive me into Elkton and then left me stranded on the side of Skyline Drive. It was nice getting back on the trail but I pushed myself so my wife wouldn't have to wait as long (and to make sure I didn't get stranded in the woods after sunset). I met my wife and we headed back up Skyline Drive to the Skyland Resort where I had spent a day waiting out the rain.  Before we got there, we were able to watch the sunset at the very same overlook where I was stranded. My wife was happy as she got some nice pictures. We then drove to Skyland. On the way there, we saw two bears (two separate sightings) and a large white-tailed buck with an enormous 10-12 point rack. At Skyland we checked in and ate supper. I had been assigned a room in the Maple cabin, immediately next to the room I had stayed in this past April. The following morning we had a nice breakfast (BlackBerry waffles with blackberry syrup). We then drove to Mcafee's Knob as my wife really wanted to get a picture of herself on the Knob. The hike was much hotter than when I had made the walk this past spring.  On the way back, I decided to walk along the Appalachian trail as I had missed a small section (probably having been too engrossed in conversation with Grumpy that we stayed on the tourist trail). On this portion of the trail, I surprisingly ran into NoDoubt, an older gentleman I had met from where he had started his Flipflop hike in Daleville, VA until we separated in Glasgow. I had then also met him in one of the White Mountain huts. He is almost finished with his thru-hike in spite of his challenges of hiking with macular degeneration and COPD. Finally for this day, we drove down to Woods Hole hostel where I had spent my 6th and 7th nights on the trail. My wife seemed to enjoy the picturesque setting and the welcoming atmosphere.  Throughout these days of driving, I was continuously amazed at how far I had walked.

When I had been there, she had announced that she was separating from her husband (and he had been somewhat rude). While I was here, he was back from Georgia but we found out that the couple was getting a divorce.  She was still able to run the hostel but I wonder whether she will be able to keep the whole farm going. Keeping the hostel in her family may also be difficult. Her husband was doing a lot of chores but now I wonder whether this was to increase the value of the property when it was appraised as part of a divorce settlement.  I hope the hostel can continue as this remains my favorite hostel on the entire Appalachian trail that I have stayed in. My wife also enjoyed the experience as she told me that she had enjoyed coming out here more than she had initially thought she would. On the drive down to Atkins, I again was amazed at how far I had walked.  When we reached the Barn restaurant I started hiking. I had far too much food again. I hadn't gotten around to treating my clothes with permethrin so I was also carrying a small bottle of this so my bag was quite heavy. Right away I could see that the terrain had changed quite a bit as it was much more overgrown and there were different species of flowers blooming.  I enjoyed seeing the Lindamood school which I had seen on multiple YouTube videos. I also got the chance to climb my first 4000 foot peak since the blue blazed trail on Mount Killington. I reached the Partnership shelter after a relatively short day. I decided to stay there as there were three other southbounders there (a real novelty for me) and I recognized I probably had lost some of my trail legs from my extended break  and well as the fact that I was breaking in my fourth pair of new shoes (which generally felt delightful as the last pair had been used since Manchester, VT and had been breaking down due to the rocks in Pennsylvania). I discussed strategies with the other southbounders about how they were going to deal with the closure of three shelters coming up after only about another day due to excessive bear activity around those shelters in the Grayson Highlands.  I decided to sleep in the shelter and I was able to get the entire second floor to myself.","Atkins, VA

The terrain has a few rocky sections but there are also many smooth sections.  It's just different as I've never really hiked much in the southeast. The rhododendron tunnels were particularly strange as they could get quite dark. At the Trimpi shelter I saw the longest snakeskin in my life.  Someone had hung it off the side of the shelter. It probably belongs to a large 5 foot Black Rat Snake which several people had commented on in Guthooks. At my lunch, I set my goal to be Hurricane Mountain shelter as this is the last open shelter before the next three are closed.  However, as I usually do, I set a stretch goal of Virginia 603. I was able to get a reservation for the Sufi hostel so I hoofed it for the last three miles to reach the shuttle on time. The hostel was fairly nice as I had heard mixed reviews. I was able to get laundry done as I hadn't done that since I was back in Pennsylvania.  The owners were friendly and weren't pushy. I did get the opportunity to soak my feet in Epsom salts.

The terrain changed a lot from that point.  I saw a lot of horse and cow droppings but no animals for a long time. The terrain was very rocky and then became full of a lot of puddles after a passing storm (although I only encountered drizzle). The wet rocks made it harder to make good time,  combined with having to glance around a lot to try to see ponies. The views were quite beautiful.

Windrider and I were ready to go early but because sunrise has been getting later,  we actually waited for a while until we could hike without headlamps. There was a lot more to see today. We hiked through an a seemingly enchanted forest (which was most unique because of all the moss growing on the ground without significant undergrowth.  A bit further on, there was a decorated Christmas tree which was a memorial for a set of 12 year old twins who had apparently died. The prettiest area of the trail was a location called Beauty Spot. On one side of the ridge you could see a nice view of a local town,  but the other side was more impressive. The valley on that side was encased in clouds, but we saw a ridge of high peaks (several higher than 6000 feet) including Mount Mitchell which is the highest peak in North Carolina. We had initially thought it might be the Smokies but a local trailrunner corrected us. Most of the rest of the day was downhill.  When we reached Erwin, TN we stopped at Uncle Johnnie's hostel. We had hoped to slackpack to avoid several long uphill climbs but their options were limited. While most of the hostel seemed dirty, they did have a decent resupply and I liked their system of a shuttle into town. Our group had a nice meal at a Mexican restaurant and then went to Walmart.  We regretted not getting a private room as the regular rooms were stuffy and quite hot. I now have less than 350 miles before I will have finished the entire trail.","Cherry Gap Shelter

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603449,The night was quite warm and my sleep was disturbed.  Fortunately we had two fans which provided some ventilation.  This was a very hilly day. There was a view of the river heading away from Uncle Johnnie's but otherwise there wasn't much to look at. I  found myself lagging at the end of the day and had to let Windrider pass me. Later I found out that I had climbed 598 flights of stairs which was a record for me on the Appalachian trail. I then took a needless hike to the water source simply to get over 600 flights of stairs. The only other time I had surpassed 600 flights was last December when I scaled Mount San Jacinto in southern France.  The other interesting thing was finding a shelter with bear cables which is the first time I have encountered them. I hear that these will get far more common as we get further south. At this point our plan is to hike 17 miles and then get picked up by a hostel. I should then be able to watch the Iowa football game.,"Erwin, TN

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603450,"I had a wonderful night's sleep,  partially because I decided to sleep in my tent rather than join 4 other hikers in a relatively dirty shelter.  We picked up two more flipfloppers including Riverdance who just graduated with a masters degree in computer science from Georgia Tech,  and IDHATN ( pronounced Idaten but standing for “I don't have a trail name “. I got an early start before dawn. There were some interesting things to see, particularly going over a Bald during sunrise and then going through an area frequented by birders including blinds and nets to capture and tag songbirds.  We also crossed Interstate 26. We made good time and made it to the hostel by 4 pm. The hostel was very nice, much better than Uncle Johnnie's. Only Windrider and myself decided to stop at this hostel as the other three flipfloppers decided to keep hiking. Windrider watched the Florida game and then I watched the Iowa football game. I stayed up until nearly midnight when Iowa finally lost a close game because of turnovers. There were only two other guests (non-hikers), who happened to be from New Richmond,  WI and we talked to them over supper. Based on the trail spacing, we decided to slackpack 21 miles tomorrow to another hostel followed by arriving in Hot Springs the next day.","Bald Mountain shelter

Because we were slackpacking, we both seemed to fly up the trail.  We saw the gravesites of two people who were killed after coming down south to visit relatives during the Civil War. I climbed over Big Butt and laughed at the sign about the bypass (which I dubbed as the Colostomy). There was a beautiful ridge walk.  We had been warned about this section of trail, but overall it was quite manageable as some Northbounders have said that there are relatively few rocky sections left on the trail. The Hemlock Hollow hostel was another very nice hostel. There we met two Northbounders. The plan is to try to get to Hot Springs tomorrow.","Devil Fork Gap

I did ascend a blue blazed trail to climb up a new fire tower and had a decent (although very overcast) view of the approaching Smoky mountains.  The view from Lovers Leap looking at Hot Springs was very nice. In Hot Springs, I checked in to the Sunnybank Inn which is the oldest building in town and is furnished with antiques. We were able to get the exact room (and bed) that Earl Schaefer (the first AT thru-hiker) slept in.  We had a nice dinner and then tried to do laundry. Unfortunately the laundromat is closed and the only other spot to do laundry was another hostel (Laughing Heart). I went there while Windrider went to the Dollar General for a few things. We're looking at possibly making it to Standing Bear hostel in two days but the terrain may be too hard.","Hemlock Hollow hostel

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603660,"I slept fairly well.  We decided to not eat breakfast at the hostel (which wasn't served until 8:30). Instead,  we went across the street to a diner which opened at 6:30. I had a nice filling breakfast and we were on the trail by 7:30. I was able to find my North Carolina geocache leaving only Georgia to complete that goal. I also saw my third bear (which simply ran away before I could get its picture). I also received a beesting on my right index finger.  We had several gigantic climbs and I set a record high for flights of stairs climbed in one day. As I write this I realized I had climbed 699 flights and I am debating getting out of bed to climb one more simply to say I climbed 700 flights in a day. Originally Windrider wasn't sure if we could get to Standing Bear hostel in two days. However when we arrived at the shelter,  we decided to press on to Max Patch as we knew that bad weather was moving in and we wanted to see it without clouds if possible. We collected extra water and found a clearing for camping and then went up the mountain. Fortunately while it was quite cloudy, we still had a decent view. We went back to the campsite, set up our tents, ate dinner and then returned to the summit.  In the meantime, most of the clouds had cleared up so we had a decent view. The sunset was pretty but not sensational because the setting sun was obscured by clouds to the west and the Smokies also were generally encased in clouds. Either way it was a nice end to the day. We will also have an easier day tomorrow getting into Standing Bear hostel. We are considering taking a zero as bad weather is forecasted for the next two days and we're not looking forward to a long hike into the Smokies in the rain.","Hot Springs, NC

In the morning I could hardly hold onto my hiking pole. The expected rain held off except for a few sprinkles as I was getting up and packing up.  We reclimbed Max Patch and we still had some decent views. I heard from another hiker that a wedding was held there later in the morning. I had a bad fall heading down from Max Patch when I slipped on the side of a rock landing on my thigh.  The area was scraped up but fortunately I was otherwise uninjured. The rest of the day was uneventful. After hiking past the FAA tower the rest of the trail was downhill. I got to Standing Bear hostel before the heavy rains started. While the hostel had some interesting architecture,  it clearly had seen better days. Now it is relatively filthy and is managed by chain-smoking hillbillies. If 1-2 inches of rain wasn't forecasted along with a huge climb, we would have kept on hiking. I had a frozen pizza and fortunately I was even able to have a few beers. We splurged for a cabin and had to put old threadbare stained sheets on the bed. The towels were crusty.  I'm looking less forward to a rest day tomorrow.","Max Patch

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603684,"I thought I slept okay but Wind Rider reported I was snoring a lot (and I reported that he had been snoring as well). We guessed there was so much mildew in the cabin that both our airways were somewhat swollen.  I know I mostly only snore on my back, but whenever I rolled on my left side or belly my new scraped thigh squawked at me, making me want to roll on my back. For breakfast we were able to scrounge out some breakfast sandwiches.  The expected rain never really developed so some of us grumbled about staying around. The day was saved after someone was willing to shuttle six of us to Walmart for a combined $35 fee. We were able to eat at Wendy's and get our resupply done with something other than canned food.  We also combined for a group dinner which was very nice. Otherwise I updated this blog and spoke with lots of people such that I never even had time for a nap or reading. The current plan is to get up early and hike out early into the Smokies. Tomorrow may still be a bit rainy, but the weather forecast for after that has definitely improved with several sunny days over the next week.","Standing Bear hostel

The rain seemed to have passed by as the heavy rain we had seen on radar to our west had disappeared.  My pack was heavy with 5+ days of food and we had a huge climb into the Smokies. While the weather was fairly nice with only occasional sprinkles, the clouds remained the entire day so I had essentially no views. The plane crash site was a disappointment as it was much less significant compared to the one in Philmont.  By the end of the day I had climbed over 640 flights of stairs which now seems to have become more common. I realized that there may not be any climbs like today's left on this thru-hike. We are debating about doing either an easy 13 mile day or a 21 mile hike so we might be able to get out of the Smokies a day earlier as most of our group of five flipfloppers doesn't like the fact that we have to use the shelters.  I also met a southbounder from Paris whom I had met in a blueberry patch in either Massachusetts or Connecticut.","Standing Bear hostel

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603826,"Most of our group slept poorly as there was a lot of stirring,  particularly given how many mature males have to go to the bathroom frequently.  We got up early as we knew that we had a 21 mile day with a moderate number of climbs. The sky was initially clear.  There were some nice views today as we did a lot of ridge walking. The highlight of the day for me was Charlie's Bunion.  At this site I shimmied up a steep rock face and took off my shoes and socks to get a picture of my bunions on Charlie's. There were lots of day hikers,  particularly around Newfound Gap. I was starting to lag at the end of the day. Ten of us initially planned to stay in the shelter per the rules, but shortly before dusk a group of seven young kids came in. As thru-hikers are supposed to give way to people with reservations,  I and several others got our tents pitched quickly but the new people ended up setting up their own tents. I will probably sleep better anyway. Tomorrow we plan another big day of 19 miles to a final shelter as we will have a 17 mile final day to Fontana village. We went over the 90% of the trail finished today. Tomorrow we should go over 2000 miles hiked making us official thru-hikers.  While the Smokies have been beautiful, there are too many people on the trail so I will be glad to be finished with them.","Tricorner Knob Shelter

They were up late and then complained about how the thru-hikers were only concerned about miles and they would hike 8-10 miles every day.  One of them asked if there were any bear boxes around to leave trash in. The hike to Clingmans Dome was relatively easy as it was early in the day. I had the entire structure to myself initially. Unfortunately the area was shrouded in clouds but I still managed to get one nice picture.  The rest of the day was relatively hard, particularly a long climb over Thunderhead mountain late in the day. I walked over 48,000 steps and climbed the equivalent of more than 500 flights of stairs. I am now an official thru-hiker as I have hiked more than 2000 miles of the Appalachian trail this year.  The plan tomorrow is to walk 17 miles to Fontana Dam and then stay in the village for the night.","Mount Collins Shelter

That shelter had a warning about dangerous bears.  During the night I actually heard a bear come up the hill and made a low guttural call. I woke up and made various low grunting noises trying to make me sound larger but also to make me sound unafraid.  I then updated Trail Journals and looked at my phone as I had service until I heard the bear move away back down the mountain. In the morning I did some hiking with Flash, a hiker from California. We made rapid progress as the trail was mostly downhill except for two moderate ascents.  I climbed up to the fire tower and experienced perhaps the most beautiful views on the entire trail (but I realize that I wasn't in a good space emotionally when I went through the White mountains). After crossing Fontana Dam I waited for Wind Rider who seemed to be dragging after walking three big days in a row.  We decided to get a room in the Resort as they had a competitive hiker rate, and we really needed to do laundry. Because Wind Rider says his feet were really aching, we are not likely going to be pushing our mileage and may look into slackpacking.

While I only walked about 15 miles, I climbed the equivalent of over 500 flights of stairs. Otherwise the day was somewhat boring. We did get to see a dead copperhead on the side of the road.  Jacob’s Ladder was a bit of a disappointment as we couldn't even really tell where or what it was (except perhaps a steep section of trail?).

Otherwise there wasn't a lot to see today.  We are planning to go into Franklin, NC tomorrow to resupply. I will probably enter Georgia this weekend.

On the way down, I was followed by a dog. She appeared to be a bear dog as she had two GPS tracking collars on.  She followed me for over 3 miles. I walked up the side trail to Silars Bald which had the best views of the day. The dog then followed River Dance for another three miles to Winding Stair Gap. At that point we were able to borrow a leash and call the owner.  They drove a good ways out. The son was pure redneck and rather than thanking us, he immediately went on the defensive that he feeds the dog (which was quite thin). I then talked to his father who was much more polite. They had been training the dog last night but had neglected to turn on one of the collars so the dog remained outside in the woods overnight.  I had fed it some beef jerky and some cashews which it wolfed down. Several of us felt sorry to have to let the dog go back to her hillbilly owners (who like to pronounce “Bear"" as “Bahr""). Wind Rider and I walked to the next gap and got a shuttle into Franklin. The hostel seemed nice but the owner was a bit weird (such as making us immediately wash our hands and then have to wear slippers but then he would go outside to smoke (which is a FAR more dangerous activity).

There were a lot of weekend backpackers out enjoying the holiday weekend.  When we got to Standing Indian mountain, we realized this would be the last time I would be above 5000 feet this thru-hike.

I'm also worried that the newly formed Tropical Storm Michael will be affecting my weather (and my planned end date) when it slams into the Florida panhandle and then into my area.  The hike today was generally downhill so I made good time.

The day went fairly well. I completed a goal when I found a geocache in Unicoi Gap  as this was the 14th state that I found a cache along the trail. The weather was overcast and there was some light rain. I had three substantial climbs today and I ended up hiking the equivalent of over 525 flights of stairs and 40,000 steps. However because I was slackpacking I completed the day with enough time to get a shower before the shuttle left. Besides dinner,  I also did some resupply at the Ingles grocery store. After dinner I spoke further with Sir Packsalot. He had been a psychiatric nurse before starting this hostel. He agreed with me that a majority of the smokers and marijuana users were depressed and simply didn't know it. They were self treating themselves with tobacco or other drugs. Hurricane Michael is generating a lot more interest.  However my hiking companions seem to be downplaying any risk - largely because Hurricane Florence didn't really hit us hard.

This was the same caretaker who forced me away from using a picnic table after he lit up a cigarette (and then smoked marijuana openly after that). Cigarette smoking caretakers have been one of the disappointments of this trip as these people are so concerned about their own wellbeing that they are oblivious to any one else's.  This encouraged us all to head out. One nice thing was that Hop Sing (a flipflopper whom I had met on his first day out of Harper's Ferry) came by with some trail magic of a few breakfast sandwiches. The trail wasn't too bad.

Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604379,"It rained torrentially overnight.  It was hard to find a window of light rain even to relieve myself.  Besides the noise of the wind, the tin roof of our shelter amplified the noise whenever it was pummeled by an acorn.  By morning the rain had let up so I got on the trail shortly after 9 am. Trail conditions were generally good. While everything was wet,  I only heard one tree fall and I only ran into one significant windfall. The trail was relatively easy so I covered the distance to Springer quickly.  At one point I was almost hit by a fallen branch. The original plan had been to meet at the last shelter. I reached this, had a large snack and then filtered 2 liters of water.  When my friends didn't appear, and because it had recently became sunny, and because there were a lot of yellow jackets around the shelter, I went to the top of Springer where two of my friends were.  Wind Rider had no desire to hike the Approach trail so he had planned to stop at Hawk Mountain shelter and then meet up with his son tomorrow. I got the requisite photos but didn't sign the log as there were a lot of yellow jackets here as well.  I suggested starting the Approach trail and stopping at the first shelter but the other two hikers wanted to go back to Springer Mountain shelter. At this point I was a bit upset with them as they hadn't waited for me and wouldn't listen to my recommendation. Therefore I didn't feel bad about leaving them behind.  I started down the trail at a good clip. I thought the Approach trail was more indicative of the rest of the trail as the Georgia section was generally quite easy. It entails a lot more than simply walking down the waterfall. After hiking this, it is my opinion that this should be the official start of the trail. Because I was still on a bit of an adrenaline high from finishing the trail,  I made great time and was able to finish just before sunset. The waterfalls were gorgeous and probably more impressive because of the heavy rains brought on by Hurricane Michael. At the visitor center I took a selfie under the arch. I then planned on getting a room at the Lodge as I assumed it wouldn't be full. While walking about a third of the way there, I was able to call and found out they were full.  I was stuck. I read about the Max Epperson shelter but had a hard time locating it (behind the visitor center was the only thing I read). I started back up through the arch but remained going straight as I started to look for a stealth site. Fortunately, shortly after starting down the side trail, I found the shelter which I had to myself. I quickly set up and cooked my last hot meal on the trail. It was fully dark by the time I finished eating.  I had some difficulty uploading a Facebook post but this finally posted around midnight. I immediately started getting lots of comments. I enjoyed my last night on the trail. I had walked over 54,000 steps and had climbed the equivalent of 543 flights of stairs. Tomorrow I will wait for Wind Rider to finish. I will stay with him tomorrow night and then go on to my groomsman’s home on Saturday. My first plan is to watch the Iowa Hawkeye football game which is being broadcasted on ESPN2.
I'm not sure it's really set in yet, but I'VE COMPLETED HIKING THE ENTIRE APPALACHIAN TRAIL!","Gooch Mountain shelter 
",Amicolola Falls Visitors Center ,"Oct 11, Thu",23.30
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606171,"Today is New Years Day. I waited so long for 2018 to arrive. While it was a very eventful year, it's already over. As 2019 begins, it has been nearly three months since I summitted Springer Mountain and then hiked the Approach Trail to complete my flip-flop Appalachian Trail thru-hike. At the time I simply wanted the hike to be done! I was glad I had done the hike and was proud of my accomplishment but knew that it had been harder than I had thought it would have been. Since then I have wondered if and how I had been changed by the experience. This post will summarize some of my thoughts to date. 
Physically, I finished the trail in fantastic shape. I lost about 34 pounds (and except for the 10 pounds of water weight from glycogen stores), I haven’t gained most of it back yet. I had blood work done shortly after returning and had my blood pressure rechecked and all three criteria which had made me prediabetic appear to have reversed. My systolic blood pressure declined from 144 to 117. My triglyceride level dropped from 160 to 85. My beneficial HDL cholesterol rose from 37 to an all time high for me of 51. Maintaining the weight loss will be a priority. My current goal is to attempt to complete 100,000 steps each week rather than striving for the more easily obtained standard 70,000 steps. A recent new subscription to Netflix should help to keep my treadmill time interesting. Having an improved Iowa Hawkeye basketball team has also made this a possibility. While I really vegged out when I went home for several weeks for my son’s high school graduation, I have achieved at least 70,000 steps every week except one (when I had a root canal done) and have achieved 100,000 steps four weeks. I had done a few outdoor hikes along the Ice Age Trail but once the November hunting season started and snow has fallen, I haven’t really been in the woods since. I have enjoyed Christmas treats a bit too much but clearly my overall health was improved by the hike except for a few minor issues (my toes are still tingling and I occasionally get a pain in my right shoulder when I rotate my neck to the right - possibly caused by a herniated disc in my neck caused by hitting my head on too many branches while watching my feet). Hopefully I have delayed the date at which I will have to start taking medications for diabetes or hypertension. 
During my hike, I decided I wasn’t ready to retire. However, I did make the decision to do far fewer emergency room overnight shifts. I also decided to only work three days per week in the clinic (rather than my prior four). While my income will drop, this amount keeps me accessible to my patients and hopefully in a better mood for them. I have been enjoying my clinic shifts far more than I had prior to the trip and having a day off when I am not exhausted from an overnight ER shift has been outright decadent. I really enjoy having Monday evenings to myself. I will still be doing occasional ER shifts if I am needed but have not really missed these. I seem to be more understanding and have been spending more time with my patients but I find that I still get upset when coworkers make the same mistakes repeatedly so I can’t really say that I am a dramatically different person. I am clearly much more likely to raise the possibility that stress may be causing an illness (or making it worse) as I saw how so many hikers resorting to tobacco, marijuana, and excessive alcohol to avoid dealing with their personal stresses. At this point, I almost assume that a smoker has significant depression or anxiety issue (although the research suggests that this is true for only 50-70% of smokers) as all the non-depressed smokers have already quit tobacco and other drugs. I am more committed to helping these people with counseling or antidepressants as nothing else will likely help these people. 
I have enjoyed having an empty nest at home. I had several weeks to catch up on neglected chores prior to returning to work and winter hitting. I find I have been helping around the house far more than I had before the trip. I have reverted to getting less sleep as I have been spending some of this time in front of the computer or on the treadmill. I have been doing far more laundry and cooking more meals. I really enjoy Blue Apron meals which force me to cook using more vegetables. 
I also remain firmly committed that a Flip-flop hike is the best way to hike the trail. I almost consider a northbounder to be environmentally irresponsible (my opinion only) and would not be opposed if the ATC decided to impose a lottery system on Northbound hikers. I found that Flip-floppers tended to be the best people to hike with. However, I would not repeat my type of Flip-flop. Starting at Atkins, VA was a good location. However, doing the trip southbound from Katahdin was clearly the worst section of my hike (except I really enjoyed most of the Hundred Mile Wilderness), mostly because there were hardly any other mature hikers heading in the same direction. I really enjoyed the first 500 miles in Virginia. I also enjoyed the last 500 miles heading south from Atkins as I was able to have a proper Tramily again. The 1300 miles I hiked from Katahdin to Fayetteville, PA was largely by myself. While I tend to be a loner, I was surprised at how much I missed having friends during this section of my hike.  Starting at Rockfish Gap or Harper’s Ferry would be fine as well but I appreciated the rest stop at those locations. There was really nothing making me want to stop at Atkins, yet it was very accessible from the Interstate. I feel a Flip-flopper would be best served by hiking all the way to Katahdin before doing their flip. 
I also feel that more rules by the ATC are appropriate. I know there are many people who are opposed to any rules as they wanted to “Hike Their Own Hike”. While this trip clearly did reaffirm my sense that most people are decent people, I remained a bit skeptical about some of the tobacco, drug and alcohol abusing hikers. These people were generally very nice, but somewhat in the same way that criminals will be nice to their own friends and family as these same people would often speak harshly about an outsider imposing any sorts of rules. Any unknown person or anyone doing things a bit differently might not be treated with as much respect by many of these people. I considered myself to be safe along the entire trail but I do feel sorrow for these people who are clearly struggling. Again, this is simply my own opinion. My approach to these people when I see them as patients is to hate the sin but love the sinner.  
I also feel that the Approach Trail should be considered an essential part of the trail. It was clearly far more than only 600 steps and would be an appropriate introduction (or finale) to the trail. I know this would take an act of Congress to accomplish this so I won’t hold my breath, but I would encourage all future hikers to hike this section of the trail at least once. 
Treating clothes with permethrin worked wonderfully. I only found three ticks on the entire trail and none of them had bitten me. 
Unlike many novices and like many other thru-hikers, I feel that the particulars about gear aren’t really that important. As long as you have some sort of experience with your gear, you can make it work on the trail. I really liked my Z-packs Duplex tent and my ULA Ohm 2.0 backpack. While I had several ground pads during my hike, I think the Thermarest NeoAir is the best one I have used. I did not appreciate Smartwool underwear as it was always wet during humid conditions. I loved Injinji toe socks (trail weight) to start out the hike as they worked well to prevent blisters, but then realized that these contributed to the development of corns so I reverted to Farm2Feet Damascus socks as the most comfortable I used on the trail. Overall, I would have brought along less clothes as laundry services were never really that far away. The Sea to Summit sleeping bag liner worked great to keep my Enlightened Equipment quilt from becoming too stinky along the trail.   
I do find that it has been hard to talk to non-hikers about the trail. I haven’t really corresponded with anyone from the trail (except through Facebook). I have been asked to serve as a moderator for the Class of 2019 Appalachian Trail group and have been doing this and have generally held my tongue when I see the naive posts of next year’s hikers. I know that I was there once. When the class is out in the woods, someone will need to do the behind the scenes administrative work of approving members and reviewing reported posts. I wish there were fewer trolls given by armchair hikers but such people seem compelled to put others down (usually in order to make themselves feel a bit better). Again, I have sorrow for these people. However, I don’t see myself moderating for the Class of 2020. 
Overall, I seem to have avoided a case of Post-Trail Depression so far. I think that I was open about my life stress going into the trail and I learned some new stress management techniques. Returning to work with lower work hours seems to be the right decision. Overall, my mental health has been surprisingly good as there have been some difficulties (including having my daughter announce that she was going to drop out of the University of Minnesota as she doesn’t like college). I do know that for the last 200 miles of the hike, I was simply ready to finish the trail. This overall sense that I achieved my goals has perhaps limited my sense of wanting to return to the trail but I know that many successful thru-hikers will still suffer from post-trail depression . 
I have given a presentation to the local Rotary Club and will be giving another to my church. The talk seemed to go very well. However, it is hard to summarize such an epic trek into a short talk. My first Power Point presentation had over 700 pictures which I was able to summarize into a 45 minute discussion which triggered lots of questions and compliments. I also wrote a proposed sermon for the presentation I will be doing at my church which I will attach as a separate post. 
What’s next? I have been surprised at my lack of events to look forward to. I have hardly looked at the Countdown App which I checked multiple times daily for months before my hike. My wife and I are considering doing a three week hike along the El Camino in Spain perhaps in the fall of 2020. Before then, we are considering take a cruise around Hawaii (which would be my 50th state to visit). I am also considering section-hiking the Pacific Crest Trail (perhaps in quarters every other year to help maintain weight loss). However, I have little desire to return to the Appalachian Trail at this time. I also don’t feel compelled to attend Trail Days. I do have goals to hike some other regional trails. I am considering trying to hike the completed sections in Wisconsin of the North Country Trail and may consider hiking the Border Route Trail in northern Minnesota next fall. I feel my decision to hike the Appalachian Trail before the Pacific Crest Trail was the correct one as mistakes are far easier to be corrected on the AT than on the PCT.
In summary, I am proud to have completed a successful Appalachian Trail thru-hike and don’t really find that I miss the trail. I am glad that I don’t seem to be afflicted by post-trail depression as much as I thought I might have. I will continue to support the trail as I think this opportunity for growth should continue to be available for others. Perhaps my urge to get out there will change next spring. This blog will probably end as its raison d’etre has ceased to exist. I will still receive comments if someone wants to contact me. Good Luck to any readers who are considering a thru-hike. There doesn’t seem to be a way to predict how the trail will change you. You simply have to get out there and actually hike the trail.",,View Entry,"Jan 01, Tue",0
Trailblazer / Fleischman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607894,"This entry is the actual text of a sermon I gave to my home congregation. It was accompanied by 60 slides which unfortunately cannot be displayed in TrailJournals. This is my last entry for this Journal. I hope to hike the Border Route Trail in northern Minnesota this fall. Spiritual Journey
Several months ago, I successfully backpacked the entire 2200 mile long Appalachian Trail. I felt compelled to do this for many reasons including reaching several milestones. I was about to turn  20,000 days old. My youngest child was graduating from high school. I had lost both parents and my oldest sister to cancer. I was also developing some health issues of my own (including prediabetes and a hernia surgery). I made the decision to hike nearly seven years ago and had a plan for getting into backpacking shape. I finally set off on March 29th. I finished the entire trail down in Georgia on October 11th.    
Before I had embarked on my hike, I had heard that there are three stages to any long distance trek. The first third focuses on physical challenges:building up your muscles, toughening your ligaments and tendons, and dealing with overuse injuries.The second third focuses on mental challenges:particularly dealing with adversity, boredom, homesickness and analyzing why I ever wanted to put myself through this in the first place. The final third focuses more on spiritual challenges: what have I learned, how has the trail changed me, what is my purpose in life going forward. As I had lots of time to think along the trail, I pondered some of these questions. Most people in this room understand that spirituality is important, but how does someone become more spiritual? 
Even Jesus went out into the wilderness to attend to some of his own spiritual issues.During this trek, I set out to attend to some of my own concerns. I had found it difficult at times to find peace in religion at home when good people were arguing over relatively unimportant issues such as evolution  or homosexuality. Jesus really didn’t die for us to argue over issues like these. Seeing national and world news of different religious groups fighting each other didn’t really seem inspiring either. Should anyone even want to become more spiritual? This talk is designed so that you can see your own life as somewhat of a thru-hike. 
Prayer is a good place to start. After seeing this done on a YouTube channel, I started to greet the trail every morning at one of the white blazes which mark the way.    This evolved into a quick daily prayer and consisted of “Thank you for letting me be on the trail. Thank you for watching over me. Please continue to watch over me as well as my family. Help me to understand what you are teaching me through this experience”.  But goodness never arises simply by reading through a litany of prayers. The period of contemplation walking down the trail after reciting these words was more important than the words themselves.  
I did attend church services several times on the trail when I remembered it was Sunday and I was near a town. One day I attended an Episcopalian church in Vermont and increased the number of congregants by 50%! 
I listened to many Audio books while on the trail. I chose books with a religious flavor multiple times to help me consider what I was learning. Some of those books were wonderful and others were puzzling. My favorite was “A Prayer for Owen Meany” by John Irving. The most eccentric was “The Tao of Pooh” which tried to explain Taoism based on Winnie the Pooh’s sayings. The most inspiring was Victor Frankel’s “Man’s Search for Meaning” about his experiences in the Holocaust. I also appreciate anything written by Mitch Albom (who is most famous for the “The Five People you Meet in Heaven”). These books were helpful to get me thinking about spiritual issues, but don’t expect to learn everything from only reading books.
Make sure you know where you are going. Many people can find peace and serenity and perhaps even find God by communing in the woods. However, if you actually want to get somewhere (e.g. Heaven), you really need a map. I carried a paper booklet as well as having an app on my phone.     A spiritual map could consist of religious texts, or a group such as Faith Lutheran Church which provides a framework to move ahead together. Group support can be very helpful to increase the likelihood of success. Others can help you when you are struggling but then you need to help others when they are struggling themselves.
While having a map was important, I learned to not focus on the final destination. This only tended to limit my enjoyment of the present trail. The trail had some gorgeous places. If I was only focused on miles, I would miss out on some of the beauty and growth opportunities just off the trail.   I had to remind myself that there was a very good chance that I would never see these places or people again. Rather than focusing only on the difficulties ahead, make the current hike the best it can be. It was easy to get discouraged after hiking hard all day and only accomplishing 0.6% of the trail. I found it was much better to view the trail as a series of 3-5 day hikes punctuated by brief stays in town to resupply with food, grab a shower, do laundry, and have a lighter day to allow your body to heal itself. Large achievements are completed by small steps. Live in the moment focusing more on the next few days or months rather than on what might happen years down the trail. Despairing because the destination seemed so far away didn’t make it any closer. Just getting back on track and walking a few more steps was the only way to bring you closer to the destination. Similarly, only focusing only on heaven can prevent you from identifying God’s purpose for your own life. 
Some hikers tended to complain about the negative aspects of the trail. Yes, it would be nice for the trail to be less rocky, flatter, with fewer roots and insects, with better weather and without battling pain from prior injuries or illness. However, this isn’t your choice. Many people have been successful traveling over the exact same path. Making the most of your experience often entailed the saying “Embrace the Suck”. No one ever becomes a better person until they experience some adversity. You appreciate Easter more after going through Good Friday. You enjoy Spring more after enduring a long winter. We are all on our own spiritual journey. To paraphrase thru-hiker Jennifer Pharr Davis, “we all have out long trails and most of them do not include much hiking. Our paths take the form of higher education, climbing out of debt, navigating a career, staying married, weathering divorce, surviving tragedy, and coping with illness”. Instead of focusing on the negatives you have to endure, thank God for the opportunity to be on the path. Rather than getting upset when something goes wrong, be thankful that most of the time bad things don’t happen. As a physician, when I consider the myriad of ways that a human can get diseased, it’s a wonder that we are even healthy in the first place. Ask yourself, what does God want to teach you when your life encounters obstacles? 
Hikers could also become discouraged after slogging up a mountain hoping to get a nice view at the top. Imagine their disappointment after finally reaching the top only to find the view obscured by clouds. You could resent not getting to see a view or you could rejoice over having beaten a mountain which had seemed determined to thwart you. When the view simply wasn’t there, it was best to just move on - hoping that the next view would be glorious. In real life, many people have regrets about not having an experience live up to their expectations. Many people want to relive the past again. Revel in the good times and don’t lose heart if several bad things happen to you in short succession. This is life. Make the most out of it. 
While I tend to be an introvert, I started to converse with hikers who crossed my path to discuss the trail ahead, best places to stay in town, weather updates, etc.).  I started to recognize that I was supposed to meet certain people who could help me, but also that other people were supposed to meet me so I could help them. As an example, this gentleman went by the trail name of Grumpy. I met him around Dragon’s tooth in Virginia and I hiked with him from there until I got off the trail in Pennsylvania to come home for Teddy’s graduation. I had been thankful to have met him as it was nice to have someone to share meals, shuttles, laundry, and advice. Our Group became known as the “Grumpy Old Men”. Some of us were better at planning for the next day or knew options for the next resupply while others were better at gear repairs or woodsmanship. When we separated to allow me to get a bus to the airport, Grumpy told me that he knew that God had placed certain people for him to meet on the trail at specific times. While we had talked about a lot of things on the trail, he mentioned that when he had first met me, he had been having discomfort in his right thigh which was making him very concerned that he might have to quit his trek. I immediately recognized the symptoms as meralgia paresthetica - pain caused by pinching a nerve near his groin caused by the tight waistband of his backpack.  I showed him how to fix this and the problem quickly went away. When he reminded me of this, I had completely forgotten about the incident as it had been very straightforward for me. I know that we all tend to remember the people that we have offended without really intending to do so. I have been guilty of doing this to other people as well. However, please don’t forget about all the people who benefit from being part of your life.. Are you attending to the other people around you in your own life?   Be thankful for everyone you are able to help. 
Recognize Grace when it happens. At the beginning of the hike I kept expecting to fall down with a major injury. I remember one specific incident when I was climbing up Three Ridges Mountain in central Virginia. I was climbing over a wind-fallen tree. While bringing my back leg over the tree, my toes caught on the tree bark and I was hung up for a few seconds. I scoffed at myself immediately figuring I was getting tired. However, less than two seconds after I started hiking again, a large branch fell down immediately in front of me. It would have landed on me if my foot hadn’t caught on that log. Serendipity - perhaps? My Guardian Angel - perhaps?  I remember that I thanked God for watching over me at that moment. They say that for every car accident you are involved in, you managed to avoid an average of 30 near accidents. Give thanks when something like this happens. I could have ended up like this hiker. When I started back on the trail heading south in Maine, I met Doc Tigger, who was a family physician from the Detroit area. He only lasted 3 days on the trail before falling down and breaking some ribs and his nose. As followup, on my very last day while hiking in Georgia during the remnants of Hurricane Michael, I was feeling very proud of myself for having nearly completed the trail. Another branch fell down immediately in front of me. While some people would have attributed this to the storm, my first thought was that God was reminding me that I shouldn’t feel too smug about myself. My trek could have ended unexpectedly much earlier. Most people feel they deserved good outcomes as they arose out of the hard effort involved but then not fault themselves when something bad happens. All success doesn’t come from personal merit nor do all defeats arise from someone else’s faults.  
Practically every spiritual person has recognized how Grace has affected them at one time. You may not even recognize how God is watching over you. While hiking in Pennsylvania, I came to an overlook with a beautiful view. There was a perfect rock to sit on which allowed your legs to hang down while I stopped and ate lunch. I had been alerted that snakes often frequented this location. I checked the area before sitting down and saw a rattlesnake. While trying to get a picture, I saw there was a copperhead there as well. While I was photographing them, a local came along and hopped down and noticed that there was a third copperhead directly underneath where I was standing which could have easily bit me if I had my legs hanging down there. Only after I got back home did I realize that the third snake was in this picture. The obvious danger kept me protected from the hidden peril. In real life, acting in a spiritual manner and avoiding the obvious trip falls will protect you from many unseen consequences.   
Live Simply. The trail taught that material possessions always had a cost. New possessions would be nice, but the weight they imposed could become a significant burden. Letting go of many of your possessions made the travel easier. Focus on the essentials and you realize you can get by with a lot less. 
I learned that angels do exist in real life. On the trail, they were specifically called Trail Angels - anyone who helped a thru-hiker with gifts of food, transportation, water, lodging, etc. Venting your frustrations with other hikers was common as thru-hikers knew what you had already gone through and knew some of the obstacles ahead. That combined with lots of time together often had complete strangers opening up about their deepest personal feelings. In real life, I am sure that there are people who are positively impacting your life who would be considered angels. Do you recognize these people? Do you know who they are? Thank them for their help!
Another way to simplify your life is to worry and argue about politics a lot less. I was amazed when I came back to Wisconsin that nothing had really changed. People were still complaining about Trump and there was more discussion about tariffs but everything else seemed more or less the same. Support your leaders whether they be on Church Council or one of the higher offices. Assuming you know how to do a job better takes hubris which doesn’t really lead to more spirituality. 
It was easy to get discouraged by other people hiking further or faster than you. On the trail there was an expression, “Hike Your Own Hike”. Focus on doing your best and try not to live up to someone else’s expectations. Another version of Hike your own Hike could apply to spirituality. While most of us hope to one day arrive in Heaven, please remember there are multiple trails to any destination. Some people do the trail all in one year, others only do certain sections. Some hop around or hike in the wrong direction for a time. The same happens in real life. Some of the paths are parallel such as other Christian faiths. Some are approaching from a completely different side of the mountain such as Islam or Buddhism. Some paths are easier than others but any established religion has had devotees who have successfully found their way. Be respectful of them.
Thank you for your attention today. I felt a bit humbled about speaking at church today and I don’t want any of you to get the impression that I have learned everything. I’m not a mountaintop guru with all the answers to life. I know I learned a lot about myself and I hope you have enjoyed learning about my trip. I hope I have also  inspired you to continue on your own spiritual journeys. You don’t have to backpack 2200 miles to become more spiritual. Consider simply participating in a retreat or taking some personal time for prayer and meditation. May God bless you on your journey! 
Addendum - for the hymn after this sermon, our congregation sang “Go Tell It On the Mountain”.",,View Entry,"Mar 10, Sun",0
