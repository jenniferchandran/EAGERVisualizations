Canary,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553233,"My 2017 Appalachian Trail Section Hike adventure planning/training has begun. There is going to be a HUGE change in my game plan for this year. For the first time ever, I will be going completely SOLO. NO DOG and no human companion. Yes, I am a bit nervous but have great confidence in my skills and know I will be travelling both much lighter and faster.My precious Jackson was diagnosed with Lyme’s Disease in October after a lengthy recovery from a June agility injury. This despite all the medication, vaccine, and vigilant tick checks. Looking back to last February / March, I believe there were small signs that he already had Lyme’s. His getting extremely tired on our 2016 Section Hike was a huge symptom. I am elated that we got the right diagnosis and he is on the mend. Though hiking the AT didn’t necessarily cause his Lyme’s, I can no longer take the risk with my precious agility competition dog to have him accompany me on such a dangerous adventure. We both love agility too much and not being able to play for more than ½ of 2016 was a huge sacrifice. Though I do love having his company, I will thus be carrying a lot less weight without him coming and I'll be able to gett’er done a lot faster solo.
For 2017, I am planning to finish Pennsylvania (55.4 miles), New Jersey (72.4 miles), New York (89.8 miles), and Connecticut (50.6 miles) for a total of 268.2 miles over 20 days. Squeaking 30 miles of Massachusetts would make it an even 300 miles but that might be a stretch. So with those parameters established, the detailed planning and training begins. Only 3-1/2 months to departure!",,View Entry,"Jan 12, Thu",0

Exploring options with an orthopedic doctor about my right knee. This winter has been unusually warm with very little snow.

Canary,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554548,"2017 Appalachian Trail Preparation Status: If you have ever noticed, when I hike the AT, I wear knee braces. These are mostly for downhill support. In 2010, I started having trouble with my right knee, only when I long distanced hiked and only going down 1000'+ descents. After my 2015 hike I started having slight pain with the right knee even after returning home. During my 2016 AT Section hike, it became obvious that I needed to have it checked out as the braces no longer provided the support I needed and that slight dull pain continued all the time.So, in January 2017 I went to an orthopedic specialist. I have little cartilage on the inside of the knee cap and arthritis on the outside. Nothing major needs to be medically done but it was off the the Physical Therapist who quickly turned me over to an Athletic Trainer. Seems my quads are very adequate to support my knees but my outer hip and buttock muscles need quite a bit more strengthening. Wow, I got a great list of exercises to add to my program, great education on how to use KT Tape, and an unbelievable demonstration on how to lift and massage my knee cap. We are still experimenting with the exact KT Tape configuration to use, but the tape in combination with a sturdier brace appears to be my 2017 AT Section Hike solution.
BTW, taking up jogging full-time is a no-no. So far NO issues or pain with sprinting and turning in agility!",,View Entry,"Feb 09, Thu",0

Canary,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580251,"On February 8, 2017, a precious litter of Border Collie puppies was born in Seattle, WA. I'd been waiting for this litter for sometime and it's arrival and my position on the wait list was going to make or break my 2017 AT Section Hike. I continued to practice hike and itinerary plan throughout February. But in early March I learned I was going to be the proud mama of a new little bouncing boy BC puppy named Valid. As you can imagine, all AT planning immediately ceased!!! With great excitement on March 30, 2018, I flew to Seattle to adopt him and transport him home. Due to the timing and bonding/fear periods I opted not to go hiking but stay home and begin raising my next agility partner.
My yearning for the trail was pacified by Valid's arrival and distraction. But there was yet another unforeseen distraction looming. In late April and all of May, my current agility dog Jackson and I started to come together as a team. We'd worked for this moment for 5 years and here it was BOOM!!! Happening so fast my head spun. We quickly qualified for the USDAA Nationals to be held in Murfreesboro, TN but did not have anywhere near the mental game required to perform on that large of a competition stage. So in August, Jackson and I went to a USDAA Regional in Kansas City. To go from not being able to Qualify on even 10% of our runs to running at a Regional in such a short time was mind blowing. The first of the 4 day competition, I was unable to focus enough to even have Jackson complete 4 obstacles on our 2 runs. My mental game was a mess! By Saturday, I was able to function at a level higher than Jackson and I had EVER done. Wowser!
Funny, we came home from the Regionals and my yearning for the trail and some alone time went soaring through the roof!!! But I had to stay mentally focused.... the USDAA Nationals were coming in late October!!!",,View Entry,"Mar 30, Thu",0

With USDAA Nationals a wrap, Jackson and I are on a 1 month break from agility and so begins my itinerary planning picking up where I left off last March. Yippeee!!!",,View Entry,"Oct 29, Sun",0

It is not certain if I will do my 3 week Section Hike in April or May. Agility competitions and our trainer's schedule will dictate that timing. For now, what is certain are those 300 miles of northern PA, and all of NJ, NY, CT, and MA!!!",,View Entry,"Nov 05, Sun",0
Canary,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582422,"On Thanksgiving 2017, I hiked the Delafield Section of the IAT (1000 miles hiking trail that runs through Wisconsin called the Ice Age Trail). It is a very clean, well marked and mostly paved section of the IAT. The section takes you along the Bark River and provides vistas of Nagawicka Lake. It runs right through downtown Delafield, WI and through the shopping district. There is plenty of access to resupply and hotel stays on this Section. I highly recommend catching breakfast at the Lumber Inn in the downtown area. It made for a great 3 mile practice hike as I did it solo without the pups.",,View Entry,"Nov 23, Thu",0

Canary,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582521,"A few days ago, I mentioned that in 2018 I will be doing more serious strength & sprint training than in previous year's preparations. The strength training will be for my AT Section Hike and the sprint training will be learning how to sprint in agility. Right now I shuffle along at a constant speed w/o much acceleration/deceleration. So I have signed up with a team of personal trainers who have a lot of experience with sprinting/running. So far I am pleased with the workouts and how they are pushing me to get stronger. I have always done my training on my own, strength training in the mornings at home, practice hikes in the Kettle Moraine State Forest in the evenings. This will be a new experimental approach to see if it improves my strength which should in turn reduce my knee pain and my ability to sprint/run. I will maintain the same hike practice rituals but reduce the number of miles that I allow my dogs to hike with me.",,View Entry,"Jan 27, Sat",0
Canary,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582520,"An hour practice hike on Thursday, 40 minutes on Saturday and 50 minutes today all with great elevation and challenging footing is making for a stronger Mia. So my day hike backpack has come out of the gear closet and we'll start by adding 5-10 lbs. The objective of carrying weight when I hike is so I don't have to hike farther each time to push myself to get stronger. So for example, I can add 10 lbs and only hike 30 minutes to equal hiking for an hour w/out weight.
I've been asked several times by friends this weekend if I plan to hike with a dog this year. My answer: No, I will not be taking any dogs this year. The old one - too old. The young one - too young. The middle one - too risky to our Agility passion. Besides, I believe I will hike faster and lighter going solo so we are going to give this a go. If it doesn't work out, I may have to find myself a dog hiking partner whose job is hiking. :-)
On many, many levels this adventure is very dangerous for dogs. Not only can they get physically injured just hiking but the snakes and wildlife present hazards. One year, hiking with Jack and Bandit, Jackson scared up a fawn. He recalled off of it but before he returned, the doe attempted to charge Bandit and I. Pretty dam scary. Then there are the hazards of town, the transport in/out in unknown vehicles (i.e. sometimes in the back open bed of a pickup truck), the leaving the dog outside while you go in to shop or eat. Then there is the crossing busy roads (i.e. 4-lane highways), sleeping in crowded hostels, getting rained on for hours, ticks, river crossings, other dogs attacking your dog, dehydration, and the list goes on. Also, Jackson has outwardly recovered from his very serious case of Lyme's Disease but his high tick panel counts still show he could easily relapse. A result of his 2016 toe injury has him with arthritis in his front left and the hike would not do that injury much good. So all of that has a high chance of jeopardizing Jackson's precious agility career. After putting thousands of $$$ into that career it is no longer a chance I'm willing to take for company on our hike. Jackson is going to be SO disappointed when he finds out I'm leaving him behind. He is absolutely going to KNOW where  I am going and not be good with staying home. :-(",,View Entry,"Jan 28, Sun",0

Canary,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610116,"Ever heard me say that hiking the Appalachian Trail is more mountain climbing with a pack than walking? Here's proof: The Appalachian Trail is in the Appalachian Mtns and goes up to 6600'. The CDT is the Continental Divide Trail, runs up the Rocky Mtns and goes up to 11000'. The PCT is the Pacific Crest Trail, runs up the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Mtns, and goes up to 13000'. The AT is a footpath and the other two are pack animal trails. The AT is a social hike and the other two are solitary/remote hikes. The AT is clearly a hiking ""challenge"".
There is a nice list of the 75 hardest climbs/descents on the AT that I use to prepare each year's hike. https://whiteblaze.net/forum/showthread.php/54822-steepest-part-of-the-at/page7?fbclid=IwAR03PfTQb5iGOBfRpGZbAGt-SrcGNIGG1wzqwuUDYcNCKJ0pG-DugVD7Cew Let's me know how hard each year's hike will be.

One of the rules of hiking is EVERYTHING has to be tied down so it doesn’t get lost. I’d failed to do so because my new iPhone it too large to fit in my hip belt like my iPhone 5. I obviously had a poor storage location for it. When I discovered it was lost I tried retracing my steps for over 1/2 a mile during which I only met a trail runner headed in the opposite direction. I asked him to keep an eye out for it. Having not located it by the time I hit the last time I remember using it, I decided to turn around and try again. 1/2 way back to the point I’d initially discovered its absence, the trail runner person came jogging down the trail back at me carrying the phone!!!

He has borrowed some gear, purchased some gear, and I have all the remaining pieces in my gear stash. He flew in from Portland, OR on Friday evening and we meticulously weeded through all of our gear. Here tonight we have laid out all the food on the kitchen table and organized it. Matthew has never long distance backpacked before but he and I have done several multi-day canoe trips on the Wisconsin River together and feel we will be very compatible on this adventure.

It is now time to hike 15.4 miles and we don’t want to get out of the nice warm van! I am dressed in full rain gear, both tops and bottoms. Matt has not come equipped with rain pants so he is wearing his rain coat and Under Armor leggings with shorts. I have advised him that today is a good day for hypothermia. He MUST keep moving until we get to Delaware Water Gap. So if we get separated he needs to get to John the Mechanical Man's vehicle right away and warm up. He didn't fully comprehend the gravity of what I was explaining but he did take note.
Pennsylvania IS DONE! 15.4 miles in 45 degree pouring rain greatly increases ones chances of hypothermia so we dressed really warm and kept moving with minimal breaks. Really should have brought our gloves. There was a large boulder field at one point to negotiate. Once again we saw very few people on the trail (go figure). There was massive tree damage the closer we got to Delaware Water Gap from Tuesday’s storm and tornadoes. Huge century old trees just blown over on the trail. Once again we walked in ankle deep water. There is a lot of flooding, creeks turned into rivers and ponds over flowing their dams. At one point we walked down a service road where multiple places had lakes in the road. The down into Delaware Water Gap was hard and much of today reminded me of hiking in southern Virginia and Dragon Tooth area. The AT never disappoints in its challenges!
Late afternoon it was apparent that I wasn't going to make it to Delaware Water Gap in time to meet John the Mechanical Man and Matt was getting cold waiting for me to keep up. So I sent him on ahead to meet John at the appropriate time at Deer Head Inn. Matt was shivering as he climbed into John's warm vehicle and thankful to get into somewhere warm and dry. But he still had all his wet clothes on. John drove Matt back to Wind Gap to pick up our van. It was at this point that Matt realized he was getting hypodermic, stripped all his clothes off right there in the parking lot and put all dry clothes on. He then drove back to Delaware Water Gap, picked me up at the Deer Head Inn and we headed to our hotel. We had reservations at the Pocono Inn. When we arrived it was clear they'd LOST our reservations and scrambled to get us a room. They were completely renovating the hotel and not all rooms were guest ready.

We were both simply exhausted still being fresh on the trail. In retrospect we should have stopped after 11 miles at the Brink Shelter. With no water source we took quick water inventory and decided for a cold dinner. No coffee, no hot chocolate, no random water guzzling! ? We have less than a liter here tonight between us! The hike was very tough and rocky! It sure hadn't looked this hard on the elevation maps. At least the weather was a perfect 75 with sun and light breeze. Today I came too close to a rattlesnake and Matt found a cool frog. I discovered the rattlesnake up on Rattlesnake Mountain after climbing hand over hand up a ridge and jumping up on a huge exposed rock outcropping. I heard the rattler but couldn't see him and froze. After surveying for him, I saw him slithering away to my left. Matt was behind me some distance so I took the opportunity to ""follow"" the snake for some 20 minutes at a distance. It seemed to calm my deep fear to know he really wasn't THAT scary. I moved on after he disappeared in the brush. Other than that, today was just a lot of hard walking and dreaming about ice cream.","Campsite 1307

Lazily I reach for my iPhone in a crowed 2-man tent to check the weather. Three different hikers passed by on the trail stopping to gaze at the sunrise. Much to my dismay there was a HUGE green and yellow bubble of rain on radar coming up our ridge. It was going to start raining and raining within minutes. Looking at Matt I noticed his eyes were open and then he rolled over to go back to sleep. I informed him of the approaching day long rain and asked if he wanted to get to town or spend our Nero Day (a day of low mileage) with no water in the tent? Within seconds we were both throwing things out of the tent, dressing, rolling sleeping bags, dropping bear hangs, taking down the tent, finding rain gear and stuffing everything into two backpacks. Didn’t matter whose stuff went into whose pack! 1/2 through this drill it started to sprinkle. Yes some 4 letter words were used but packed and moving in 20 minutes was impressive! We easily made town in full rain and made our way to the local fishing store for something to drink. A new hiking plan that didn't include a tent and full gear was forming. Why couldn't Matt drop me off at the trail-head each morning, drive the van to the other end of our daily Section and he start walking backwards. Once I reached the van I could drive back and pick him up at the first trail-head. Hmmmm..... THAT MIGHT WORK!!! A quick phone call to our transporter garnished some incredible luck! He wasn't supposed to pick us up until May 25th at Arden Valley Road, but he was already just minutes from our location (he could have been ANYWHERE in the entire state of New Jersey!) picking up a different hiker and taking her to our exact desired destination, Delaware Water Gap!!!! Unbelievable. We were deposited at our van at Pocono Inn by 9:30 am!!! Just Wowser!!! We drove 1/2 way up the state and got a hotel just off the trail to use as our new home base. On our way, we swung by the Mohican Outdoor Center to retrieve Matt's wallet. It rained all day!!! It was good to be inside! We napped, organized gear, ate ice cream, did laundry, answered work related e-mail and planned tomorrow. We snagged dinner at Paesano Pizzeria. A Nero was clearly good for our mental game!!!

Then I drove to the south end of our hike or Culver's Gap, parked at the trail-head parking area, and started hiking north.

I was still hiking and Matt had retrieved the van and was waiting for me at Greenville Road. A BEAR!!! A BIG MALE BEAR!!! He must have heard me coming because I was playing Simon and Garfield as loud as I could and was rocking to it! He was about 30 yards to my left and was clearly moving away while keeping an eye on me. I carefully continued passed him and on down the trail while keeping an eye on HIM!

It was a gorgeous day to hike. Matt dropped me off at the south end or Greenville Road and I hiked NoBo. He started in Vernon (still in New Jersey) and hiked SoBo after parking at the Vernon parking area. I hiked for a few miles with a hiker named Now until I could no longer keep up with his thru-hike stamina. I can feel that I’m getting my trail legs now and was able to maintain a good overall average speed. A doe and fawn tried to cross the road during a brief road walking section. They darted back into the woods. After returning back into the woods myself, Now re-appeared behind me. He’d stopped in town for resupply so I’d passed him. Again after a few miles he vanished. At the Wallkill Reserve I found a turtle in the trail. The Reserve also had some beautiful white swans. I met Matt at the Pochuck Mtn Shelter for lunch. We were making good time. From that shelter the next 4.2 miles took their toll on my feet with rocks, boulders, and climbs. I was getting worn down by the mileage, terrain and heat. As I arrived at the Hwy 517 road crossing 6 squad cars came screaming up with sirens on and parked at the trailhead along with an ambulance. Did I look THAT tired? It is a very busy Hwy and the trail head is basically just space on the side of the road so all this was stopping alot of rush hour traffic that was in a hurry to get home! The next 1.5 miles was all boardwalk over swamp and as I headed NoBo across the Hwy the EMTs and a deputy started following me with a gurney and oxygen bottle. Wow I must look pretty bad! ? Turns out a young man at the far end of the boardwalk was having an asthma attack. “6” squad cars? Really? I dragged myself the last 2 miles to the van, went and got Matt. We picked up dinner on the way to the motel. I spent several hours sorting out work related issues and then planned the next days hike before passing out. It is clear that the NJ terrain is tough and 17+ miles is probably too much for us.

So because we were exhausted from the past few days, because there was a hard climb in this section (Stairway to Heaven), because it was going to be 90 degrees today, and because we had to move our home base to a new location, we opted for low miles instead of no miles. It was s good plan. First, we spent several hours clearing out of our motel room and loading everything back into the van. Then, I hiked NoBo up the 900’ Stairway to Heaven climb while Matt hiked SoBo and did the 900’ in downhill fashion. There were tons of day hikers on the hard part and absolutely no one but Matt and I on the rest of this section. There weren’t many interesting aspects other than rocks, repeated ups and downs, and mosquitoes/ Gnats to pester you outside the tough climb. Yes it got hot! Wow it got hot! After our climb we drove an hour north into New York along the Hudson River and setup our new base camp at a religious retreat called Stony Point Center in Montgomery, NY. This retreat has a meal service so we elected to have dinner in the community dinning hall followed by a nice car ride north and south, up and down the Hudson River exploring.

NEW JERSEY IS DONE!!! It is clear that New York will not be a cake walk. Rocks! Big rocks! Huge rocks! After climbing to the highest point in New York I went to cross a stream. There were two older fellas looking at their maps on the far side. They couldn’t hear me because the stream was so loud. I slipped off a rock and sploosh into the water my foot went and my scream caught their attention. Turns out it was Cave Man and Buck Horn. They were in their late 60’s and doing the whole trail as a Flip-Flop (ie Start in West Virginia, go to Maine, flip-flop back to West Virginia, and walk to Georgia). So they hadn’t been on the trail long but Cave Man was quite the athlete. He gave me an awesome lesson in just how to use hiking boots on BIG rocks! Unbelievable what dry hiking boots can do on dry rocks! I was pretty proud of some of the billy goat moves I could do! Later I was to be very thankful that Cave Man had showed me just how to negotiate all these huge rocks with grace and speed. Today was our first “ladder climb”. That’s rebar steps up rock face. Whoa! I saw another rattler. This one scared me as it shot across the tail rattling as it went and I screamed. Found a turtle in of all places the NY high point. There are a million squirrels that jump and run around as you pass. In all it was a tough day of climbing over rocks.

25.3 miles for 2 day total. See Day 14 Journal Entry.


Mileage was complicated for these two days. Both days were clear and no rain but the 2nd day was in the low 90’s. Hot! The first day, Mia hiked NoBo and Matt SoBo. It was supposed to be a 16.7 mile day. Matt started at the tower and completed his 16.7 miles w/o issue but later learned he’d taken the wrong route by the tower. Mia was only able to complete 14.3 miles due to the large # of rock scrambles and tough ups and downs at the end of the day. She did 14.3 miles, ending at Seven Lakes Dr just short of the actual tower. Matt picked her up there as the day was running late. So mileage was amiss at the tower on both our parts. We both completed successfully the Lemon Squeezer and crossing the Palisades Parkway crossing (a very unsafe road crossing).
The 2nd day, we staged our van at the lower Bear Mountain parking lot and we had transport take us both to the northern end of our section. Our transporter was a nice young man from Stony Point Retreat. We hiked together SoBo so we could enjoy together the spectacular Bear Mountain Bridge Crossing, the Bear Mountain Zoo (the trail goes right through this zoo), and the Bear Moutain Lodge. That done, we hiked up to the Bear Mountain Tower and enjoyed the view together. The trail to the top is beautifully constructed stairs and gravel footpath. Still it was an arduously climb in the heat. Matt and I then parted ways each fixing the missed miles from yesterday thus each completing a two day total of 25.3 trail miles. Matt hiked backed to our van at the Bear Mountain Lodge and then again picked up Mia at the Seven Lakes Dr. / AT crossing.
Once again we returned to the Stony Point Retreat for the night. This was to be our last night at the Retreat and we had to move to a different building so the Retreat could accommodate a new group that arrived that day.

We woke to our final morning at Stony Point Center where we’d been staying for the past 5 nights. It had been our home base and it had been a good fit. This was a religious based retreat which had 3 dorm like buildings and a central community building which had food service. There were lots of gardens, plenty of parking, and religious groups there for various retreat type events. In the dorm we had a private room with shared bathrooms. With WiFi and laundry service available in each building it was hiker paradise. We packed up and headed north to today’s hike. Matt bought me lunch at the deli at the US9 & NY403 Deli and sent me NoBo. Then he drove to Dennytown Rd, staged the van and hiked SoBo. It was basically an uneventful day of just getting the miles in. We met for lunch mid descent/climb. After parting ways an interesting Flip-Flopper hiker from Virginia came up behind me and pretty much hung around in my way for the next few miles. He wanted to hike fast but would get too hot and stop mid-trail and I’d have to stop and wait or go around him in which case he’d pass me a few minutes later. I slowed my pace and he moved on. I never saw him again over my remaining hiking days. You see strange things out here. Toward the end of the day’s hike, a fellow who I’d met day one of hiking back in Port Clinton came up fast behind me. Now I’d been able to skip a four day section I’d done in 2016 to get this far north and this meant he’d made up all that time and was now passing me. Wow these thru/hikers were fast!

I was on the trail by 9:45 but had planned a 15.8 mile day so we should be good. The trail to the Shenandoah Mountain and the 911 painted flag wasn’t too tough. I encountered a black snake on a rocky over hang and the raised trail traversed over beautiful stone retaining walls. Going around Canopus Lake had some rocky climbs. We met for lunch at the 911 memorial flag believing it to be the 1/2 way point but something didn’t feel right on the mileage for either of us. There were lots of blow downs from the previous May 15 tornado/storms and all the rerouting was time consuming. The required level of cleanup from the massive down trees was impressive. The RPH Shelter was impressive. Lawn chairs, bunks and all. I first met Hansel and Gretel here. They are two elderly flip-flipper ladies.As I dragged myself up what I believed to be my last climb, Matt arrived at the pickup spot in the van at Grape Hollow Road. It was getting late and I was spent. I sat down to take a quick break, I pulled out my map believing I had only 1 more mile to go and discovered my foe paw!

Due to complications in parking the van at that location Matt didn’t get started till almost 10 am. Most of this entire section was not noteworthy except that it ran along Nuclear Lake named so by the past history of an experimental nuclear lab in that area. The lake was crystal clear, loaded with all kinds of wildlife, and quite a beautiful place to visit. We arrived at this location and had lunch together followed by a glorious hour nap right on the shoreline. Frustrations of getting started that morning caused Matt to not continue SoBo after our nap, instead he retraced his steps with me back to the van. We enjoyed hiking with each other that afternoon walking together across the long board walk into the railroad station. It was exciting to finally arrive at the famous railroad station and be photographed there.

Bearded Woods Hostel is amazing! Run by Hudson and Big Lou, everything is not only clean and hiker friendly but their breakfasts are fantastic! They run a tight ship and not only is there advice for hiking spot on but everything is kept on a tight schedule so you can plan your hiking day with precision. I dropped Matt at Bull Bridge Road shortly after 8 am. It had a beautiful covered bridge over the Housatonic River. Then I headed to the railroad station to park the van. I headed out from the van shortly after 9 o’clock crossing many hay fields on my way to the top of Indian Rocks. On Matt’s end of the trail he followed the Housatonic River for a long way finding a huge snake on a rock at the rivers edge. We met at the Wiley Shelter for lunch.
Lunch was one of those magical Appalachian Trail moments where many of your newly found hiker friends all rendezvous in an unplanned social event. In this case we all met at the same place for lunch. I was able to meet Postcard for the first time. Matt and he had been seeing each other every day but I’ve never met him because I was traveling NoBo everyday with him. Also at the shelter was Hantzel and Gretel and Johnny Walker. Today was our first day hiking in CT but we weren’t done with NY just yet.
After the day's hike, we returned to Bearded Woods Hostel were big Lou had dinner for us, Faye, Gandalf, Fish, Hudson and one other hiker. The hiker conversation was enjoyable before we all turned in early. Matt and Fish stayed up late talking about the shark tagging that Fish did for a living.
The AT Community has a word for everything. Matt and I are LASHers or Long Ass Section Hikers. Then there are Thru-Hikers. Yellow Blazing is cheating and getting a ride further down the trail. Blue Blazing is getting water. Slack Packing is not carrying your full pack for a day. Flip Flopping is starting your 2190 mile journey in the middle, going north or south to one end and then flipping your direction and going to the other end.

Hudson wisely suggested we only do 12.1 miles today. I’d been looking at 15+ but there was a really hard climb in this section called St. John’s Ledges. Matt and I arrived at River Road and I parked the van so we could organize our packs for the day. And who should pop out of the woods but Hard Knocks. He was the odd Virginia hiker we’d met several days ago turns out he wasn’t from Virginia he was from Louisiana and he had run out of food and was looking for resupply. As fast as I could hand him snacks out of our van they disappeared! He was very hungry and his cell phone was broken. He was headed to Bearded Woods so Hudson could take him for resupply. We offered to bring him dinner at the hostel for the night before he moved on. He took us up on our offer.
Leaving Matt behind I headed to Bull Bridge Road and parked my van. And who should pop out of the woods but Hansel and Gretel. They were both so excited to tell me about the trail magic they had gotten the night before. A very wealthy woman had picked them up hitchhiking and took them to her home for the evening where she provided them with a private room bath and a fabulous dinner! (YES, these two old ladies WERE HITCHHIKING!!!) It was an amazing hiker magic score. Gretel had lost her Spork two nights before and I gave her my Spork. She was so excited! The majority of the trail for the day was nothing to write home about but the St. John’s Ledges was clearly the focal point. It was an extreme climb whether up or down and quit vertical. It took me an hour to do that 1/2 mile as I sat on my butt and scooted down over and over.
Back at Bearded Woods other hikers that had done that same section commented on how long it took them to get down as well. That night found Bear Chaser, Hard Knocks, and Ice Ager at the hostel. Matt and I stopped at a pizzeria and picked up three Italian dishes for dinner. As we drove back to the hostel a buck jumped out in front of us and ran down the road for a bit before darting back into the woods. Matt had to hit the brakes really hard and we almost turned over dinner!!! Good save Matt! At our lunch rendezvous today, Matt and I discussed that it was going to rain for the next and last two days of this year‘s hike. We both agreed we had met our goals having completed 233.7 miles for 2018 without taking a single Nero. Walking in the rain for the next two days didn’t sound much like fun. So we agreed that the next morning we would head home after swinging by Niagara Falls.  One final note about Day 19, sadly we walked from Connecticut back into New York but after only 2 miles we walked back into Connecticut!!

We climbed in the van and headed to Buffalo, New York to see Niagara Falls. En route, Matthew was able to change his airline reservations to depart out of Buffalo that night at 7:10 PM. Logistically that left two hours to get in and out of Niagara Falls and see the falls. Neither of us knew anything about Niagara Falls, thus, we had no expectations. This was going to be interesting. When we arrived we quickly parked and made our way down to the Niagara River. It was an impressive river that madly raced toward the falls which we couldn’t yet see. As we moved to the observation deck area we were both in awe at the power of so much water. We agreed there was not going to be enough time to make it to the Canadian side to see the Horseshoe Falls so we decided to go up to the observation deck above us. I purchased two tickets at $20 each and we headed up to the observation deck. The man who took our tickets said that our tickets were for The Maid of the Mist boat ride! The what??? Matt and I could not believe that we were going on the boat, in the river, into the waterfall! Holy crap! We asked the ticket taker how long the boat ride was and he said 20 minutes. So we quickly made our way to the boat and found out we were the last to board the outgoing boat. It was typically a bit of a wait for a boat. We could not believe our good fortune! The Maid of the Mist Adventure was beyond our wildest dreams! What a beautiful finale to a fantastic adventure. After getting soaking wet we return to our van and got Matt to the airport in time for his flight. Who knew you could see the entire falls in less than two hours!!!

Canary,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611749,"7 days until “Go Time”! Today much preparation was accomplished. I secured the third transporter!!! Hallelujah! I can now make final itinerary plans. Since I’m flying I cannot put my stove’s fuel canisters in checked or carry on baggage. Also, there is no convenient source en-route from the airport to the hostel in CT to purchase some, so today I mailed two canisters to myself at the first hostel. This is called a drop box. USPS requires I mail fuel via ground which takes 7 business days so it really needed to go out today.
Speaking of items that cannot be packed in my carry on bag, I will not be able to pack my hiking poles in that. These along with my knives and tent poles will all need to be in checked baggage. Since I've never flown with all my gear before, I have been cautiously going through all the gear to make sure the carry on bag doesn't have anything that TSA will make me get rid of. Like I put all my DEET in checked baggage. Hope I got this right? I have decided also to put my empty backpack inside the carry on bag to make sure none of the straps or buckles get broken during travel. You can either pack the backpack with gear and wrap it or bag it and use it as carry on or check it. I'm choosing to take it totally empty because I have the luxury of a rental car to store my duffle bag and suitcase once on the trail.
Finally, there was tent setup practice. This is a 1-man tent I bought from Debbie Rodman and I’ve never personally used it yet. So practicing setup/tear down is wise! You just might have to do so in the rain and/or wind in a hurry! But we all know that would NEVER happen in the mountains! ?
Update: I discovered when I arrived at the first hostel, Jess Treat, that I could have purchased fuel from her and saved myself the expense and trouble of mailing my fuel canisters. Learned it pays to ask a few more questions.","

Should I put it in checked baggage? I don’t think TSA will let some of this through security right? Like 8 oz of cream cheese? Powders not in original packages?
Update: After talking with many friends, I determined that the food should go in checked bags and items that should stay cold, like cream cheese and block cheese, were packed with disposable freezer packs! It was a perfect plan and worked well!","

Canary,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611751,"The adventure begins! I will be checking two bags and only carrying my day-pack into the cabin. One checked bag is 36 lbs, the other 40 lbs. Duffle is gear and suitcase is food/street clothes/3 pair of shoes. Shoes include street tennis shoes, old hiking boots in case new ones fail, and my new trail runners (an experiment for this Section Hike).
Rough Itinerary: I’m flying into Hartford, CT, renting a car and staying at Jess Treats Hostel on 8/24. I will hike South Egremont,MA to Lee,MA on 8/25-26 and then move back south and do River Rd to Egremont, MA 8/27-30 staying with Hudson and Big Lu at Bearded Woods Hostel. I’ll spend 8/30 again with Tess Treat then move north of Dalton, MA and cover through Mt. Greylock and North Adams, MA 8/31-9/3. I'll fly home 9/4.
Game Plan Description. For inquiring minds who want to know. There are ~133 miles of CT & MA and that is my goal to complete those two states this trip. Matt and I did 9 miles of CT before going home in June and to technically complete MA you need to walk 14 miles into VT. There are no roads to bail on at the state line. So I planned to hike 138 miles. Sadly the unusual heat wave is going to leave me 18 miles short or 4 miles south of my goal to complete MA. But every mile gets me closer to Katahdin!!! 120 miles for this trip is going to be pretty darn good. I’m pleased.


So picture the 120 miles I will have hiked with mile 0 on the south end and mile 120 on the north. Day 1-2 I hiked miles 45-75, Day 3-6 I hiked miles 0-45, Day 7-10 I will hike 75-120. This is the most mixed up plan to date based on hostel schedules and the crazy weather. I don't usually like to hop around this much, but the plan worked out perfectly and I got it done!","

Mid-70s and sunny. Started late from hostel, 10:00 am after staging my car two days north. Transport took me back to south end. Two miles in, I fell on my knees on a boardwalk but thankfully was ok. Lunch at 12:30 followed by small bear crossing path. Whoa! There was a huge hornets net over the trail, sorry no pictures. Made Tom Lenard Shelter by 4:20 pm. After three miles of hiking, with great alarm, discovered backpack zipper was open, did I loose anything? With great relief I don’t think so. Got to Wilcox Shelter at 8:00 pm in the dark.

I was suppose to hike 17.4 miles today, so I rose early and left camp at 7:30 am. All tenters were section hikers and shelter sleepers were SoBo thru-hikers. Morning went well pulling decent 1.7 mph mileage. Literally stumbled across three bear playing in a tree near a creek. I got WAY TOO close before the sound of my iPod scared them off. They scattered quickly so I hiked on cautiously yelling ""Hey Bear"" ""Hey Bear"". It wasn’t long after that the effects of too high humidity and heat played their dehydration shit in me. I knew the effects had hit last night at dinner. Nauseous, headache, not hungry, a tad disoriented, I’d drank 6 liters of water yesterday and had hardly peed. I’d stopped often to let my body cool down. Well, today the cycle increased and I had to “lie down” every 45 minutes all afternoon to cool off. I didn’t feel like eating pretty much anything all day. So I called Tess to pick me up at a road crossing. I wasn’t going to hike into my car until 9:00 pm. Not only did I need to get off the trail but I was going to need some electrolytes, some food, and rest, ASAP.
Tess picked me up at Goose Pond Road mid-afternoon and sent me off to get some Gatorade, a lot of Gatorade. I am seeing a lot of electrolytes in my future!
It is now the morning of 8/27/18. It is 65 degrees and 95% humidity. It is going to be 85 degrees in the afternoon. Now to decide if it is wise to hike!","Mt Wilcox South Shelters

I was armed with a Plan A, B, C, and D. Bailout plans. For three days now I have hiked and not a single person has passed me from behind nor have I gained on anyone. The only other people I see are SoBo thru-hikers. These are all young kids who started in Maine mid-June and are walking to Georgia. They all walk past me going the other way. There have typically only been 4 or 5 per day. So in essence I am truly on the trail alone. Also, I stayed at last night’s hostel alone except for the caretaker (Jess Treat's hostel). I am at a different hostel tonight and for the next two nights also alone, just the caretaker and his wife and me (Bearded Woods Hostel w/ Hudson and Big Lu). All the thru-hikers are up in New Hampshire and Maine. What I’ve found is “I am pretty dam good company!” I am really enjoying my “me” time.
So the first 5 miles were flat as a pancake because it was river walking. Good start to what was perceived as a hard day. Just walking in the heavy air on flat was hard. I was armed with electrolytes (ie Gatorade) and more salt laden snacks. I took more frequent short breaks and required less water as I was now not sweating profusely. I also did less miles. The 2nd 1/2 of the day had 5 500’ climbs and descents. I kept my pace to 1-1/2 mph and was pleased. I arrived on time at West Cornwall Road where Hudson picked me up and drove me back to River Road South End. I grabbed dinner in Kent, CT and headed to Bearded Woods where Hudson checked me in and I moved in for a four day stay.
No bears today! Just more dam squirrels throwing nuts out of trees in preparation for winter. Gotta watch your head when they do that!
My hostel caretaker Hudson turned my next two long days into three short ones! ❤️ So I’ll be hiking tomorrow in 90 degrees with 88% humidity, just keeping the miles shorter. Hudson is an itinerary miracle worker!!! I'll hit the trail at 7:00 a.m. and will be done early afternoon where I've been ordered to be back into A/C!!!","River Road South End

Nice 90 degrees high humidity day to be hiking!!! Cough cough cough! Got an early start at 7:00 am on trail. A mile in I’m looking up at the white blazes on a huge rock wall. They beckon me “come up here and see where we are going”! Shit it’s too early for games. But up I go. Whew! It’s not a rock climb just a skinny little scamper between two huge rock walls whilst climbing over boulders! Ha! Nice try. Not much excitement all day after that which was good. New rule is “No fruit that keeps you regular while hiking” has now been applied! Too many trips into the restroom I mean Woods today! ROFL ? Finally a northbound section hiker caught up with me after 4 days. Ok so he was 80+ yo and I was laying on a rock trying to cool off. His trail name was Retriever because his last name was Golden! Ha ha ha!!! ? I out hiked him and never saw him again today. I will see him tomorrow though because I’ll be hiking SoBo and I’ll run into him still going NoBo. Saw 2 NoBo thru hikers finally and they were moving FAST. 1 with light pack the other with no pack. Typically it takes 60-70 days from here to reach Katahdin. Katahdin closes mid-October due to winter so they have only 45 days to make it! They better go really fast! I crossed the Housatonic River multiple times and finally arrived at my car. Back at the hostel, Hudson helped me plan out my last four days such that I stay indoors every night. ? I wanted to stay in my tent and did come prepared to but this heat wave requires some a/c time and Hudson was making sure I didn't overdo it! No big miles! No hiking in late afternoons! Ok Hudson you’re right! Sigh ?! Next year! ⛺️
For the record, the 44.1 miles stretch between River Road South End and Jug End Road in South Egremont, I'd planned to do in 3 days. In cooler, less humid weather, it would have been a good plan. Hudson revised it so I did it in 4 days to shorten the miles in this heat wave we seem to be in.

Trip total of 62.9 miles. Today’s heat index was 100+. 90 degrees and extremely humid. My transporter (Big Lu) and I saw a porcupine crossing the forest road leading to the AT. We got very close to him and stopped to watch. I got on the trail at 7:30 am and started with a 0.6 side-trail hike just to get into the AT. First order of business was the 500’ climb up Bear Mountain the highest peak in Connecticut at 2316’. The AT on the north side of Bear Mtn is a huge rock wall finger hold climb and here I was all by myself.  It’s the kind of climb where you toss your hiking poles up and use toe and finger holds and pull yourself up to the next ledge with a pack on! I took it slow and felt quite accomplished. At the top is a monument with a plaque that is hard to read. It says “This monument marks the highest ground in Connecticut 2354 feet above the sea built AD 1885 Owen Travis Mason”. Note in the picture I took TWO Gatorade with me today. Both were gone when I got to the car. Most of the rest of the day was spent going downhill to the 400’ above sea level common elevation with one big climb out of Salisbury and the Summit climb to Mt Prospect. I passed the 1500 mile marker today coming out of Salisbury. There were a lot of hikers today. Solid mix of SoBo and NoBo thru-hikers, Section hikers, and weekend hikers. Got to talk with a lot of people! ❤️ A deer jumped across the trail right in front of me in the city limits of Salisbury (go figure, none in the forest, only in town). Caught a 1/2 hour nap at the Summit of Mt. Prospect. Dinner was at a local deli. A/C in my car and hostel were a welcome reprieve from the heat!","Mt. Washington Road

Another hot day but 5 degrees less than yesterday. Again, Big Lu helped me stage my car, this time on Jug End Road. Then she shuttled me back to Mt. Washington Road and I repeated the 0.6 mile side-trail into the Appalachian trail and turned NoBo this time. The trail followed a stream for 0.3 miles. It was a rugged walk through a deep canyon. One of those fun stretches where you linger to explore instead of hike to make miles. It was so beautiful I just had to take too many pictures. Then I discovered I’d finished CT! CONNECTICUT IS DONE! Yippee!!! Next was the climb up to 2365’ for Mt. Race. The view and ridge walking was phenomenal!!! Wow! Again, too many pictures. Then there was the decent to 1950’ followed but a really tough climb up Mt. Everett’s back to 2602’! This climb included a long stretch of steps that were made of out either wood blocks bolted to the side of the rock face climb or steps fashioned out of rebar. If that wasn’t enough the decent to 875’ and my car was a killer decent! Wow! This all put an end to the Appalachian Trail through the Taconic Mountain Range.
I piled into my car and headed back to Tess Treats hostel to spend the night in what I now called ""my room"".

This morning it was only 61 degrees and I dawned my fleece as I climbed into the 90+ yo Cookie Lady’s blue Subaru Forester. I'd staged my rental car at the Washington Mtn Rd parking area just down from her house. She is famous for providing hikers with freshly baked cookies. Sadly I never did get a cookie. She gave me a shuttle back to Goose Pond Road.
At Upper Goose Pond, I pulled up a huge rock on the shore to sit and eat my breakfast....and then this happened!!!
OMG ?
I’m just sitting here minding my own business eating breakfast looking at my map not paying attention with a huge pond in front of me and I look up and 15 yards to my right is a huge bear standing there staring at me!!! I paced it out it was only 15 yards!!!! I jumped up and started screaming hey bear hey bear hey bear and he just gently walks off! WTH I later learned that this bear has been bothering the hikers who stay at Upper Goose Pond Cabin. It is not natural for a bear to NOT be afraid and move quickly away.... it was very unsettling.
One of my favorite road crossings on the AT is crossing OVER an Interstate. I love the thrill of standing directly over the semi-tractor trailer lane and watching the semis go under me just feet away! Today I crossed over I-90 that runs from Buffalo, NY to Boston, MA. I’m so weird!!! LOL
Other than the bear encounter and the I-90 crossing today was pretty much just about getting the miles done. I saw very few other hikers and the temps climbed only to 75 with overcast skies. Very nice hiking day. Moved home base to Shamrock Inn up in Dalton, MA.","Goose Pond Road
