AliS,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579855,Put everything in and weighed it.  32 pounds.  I should've added this was with two full 32 oz. Nalgene bottles although I just got a 2L platypus bladder/reservoir with a drinking tube I think I'm going to use instead. I also added two 3 pound dumbbells to simulate the weight of food. All of that was 32 pounds.,,View Entry,"Oct 23, Mon",0
AliS,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579857,"Hey yall,I have ordered the last bit of stuff and I will finally have everything together.  I have been collecting gear since 2014.  I am not going to lie, I didn't even know hiking the AT was a thing until I read Wild by Cheryl Strayed.  I know its about the PCT but I found out about it through reading the book. After that I become obsessed. I spent 10 years in the military and 7 deployments.  Air Force deployments so not nearly as long as the other branches.  I pushed myself mentally and physically over and over again and was the better for it. I was constantly challenging myself. I got out a couple years ago and I'm lost.  I got my degree and found a corporate job that pays extremely well for what I do but I cant stand it. I can't progress (you have to a finance degree) and I'm bored.  I've packed on the pounds and spend upwards of 10 hours in front of a computer screen.  I know I'm lucky. There are people who would kill for what I have. I don't want to complain but has anyone ever sat at there job and wondered if that's as good as its going to get?  I come from a background where you found a good job and hung on for dear life. The best you could hope for was to work for 30 plus years and then get a small retirement.  I've told a few people about wanting to hike the trail and they think I'm insane. To walk away from a good job is absolute madness.  My plan would be to put everything in storage, quit my job, hike the trail and then come back and figure out my next move.  I have enough money to cover the trail and a little bit for when I come back.  If I don't walk away from my job Ill never leave. I feel myself getting more and more depressed just sitting in this chair. I don't expect hiking to solve problems but I would love time to get back to who I am and figure out what I really want.  Time and something physically challenging is what I need.",,View Entry,"Oct 23, Mon",0
