gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577754,"Today starts the countdown.  Six Months from now, March 15th, I plan on hiking the Approach Trail to turn a Dream into a Reality.  I have backpacked my entire life, but it was a different experience prior to my AT Dream.  It was more about short quick miles to a destination/camp and then a lot of down time to relax.  I didn't worry about weight.  I often used a frying pan with a collapsable handle over an MSR Whisperlite Stove.  I was known to wear Blue Jeans and cotton T-shirts and slept in a 5lb Eureka two man backpacking tent.  I carried it all in an REI Wonderland Trekker External Frame Pack. I have slowly gone through my gear and updated and/or lightened my load; item by item.  Alway's thinking of the steps up Amicalola Falls!  Now I am ready to really finalize the list of items and continue to increase my shakedown hikes.  The amazing thing is that the Gear doesn't make the Hike.  I have great memories of the trips with my External Frame on my back and sleeping in that tent.  However, age does catch up with a person and I am hoping to hike smarter not harder!gbolt on the Trail",,View Entry,"Sep 15, Fri",0

The AT is calling.  Now I must finish my preparation both mentally and physically.  
I am in the process of learning how to use my iPhone for all of my technological needs.  This is difficult for us older hikers, especially with poor eyesight and limited thumb skill!  Practice makes perfect, So hopefully these early entries will pay big dividends six months from now.",,View Entry,"Sep 16, Sat",0
gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577925,"One of my careers for 25 Years, was serving as an Athletic Trainer at a High School. This was during the infancy of providing quality health care to a specific sports population. At the beginning of this era, salt tablets were thought to be beneficial, maintaining hydration wasn't important, and getting your bell rung didn't have a long term impact.  Thankfully things have and hopefully will continue to improve for all athletes, including Long Distance Hikers.  Thankfully, my first Head Coach understood my role in preventing injuries and returning athletes safely to the field of play.  However, he was ""Old School"" ""Woody Hayes and a Cloud of Dust"" type of coach. He believed in creating good habits and followed the rule of three's. Meaning you repeat it three times, perform it seven times to lock it in and then do it consistently for 21 days/three weeks. I still hear his voice, ""Run it again, Run it again, Run it again!""  It is for this reason that I am posting this third journal entry for the third day in a row.  Plus I am reeling from my beloved Tennessee Volunteers last second Hail Mary lost to the Gators.  Yet, Florida may have needed it more, because they are reeling from Hurricane Irma. What does this have to do with my 2018 Thru Hike?  That same storm has cause major blow downs to the Southern End of the AT. If unable to be cleared by spring, this could cause the start to be that much more rugged and success that much more elusive.  Life can change in the blink of an eye or the speed of the eye of a hurricane.

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578398,"""Why am I hiking the Appalachian Trail?""
Good question!
According to Zach Davis, author of Appalachian Trials, I am supposed to commit this to writing, before I can continue to read the rest of his book. I am strangely compelled to do it!
I am Hiking the Appalachian Trail Because:
1.  The Trail has been calling and now I have the time and resources to answer the call. 
2.  I am craving an adventure with a new challenge that will stimulate my mind, body, and soul. 
3.  I need alone time to reflect on my life and find new purpose and direction beyond a career and just meeting expectations of daily living in a concrete world.
4.  I need to turn off the matrix static and turn up the volume of the Spirit Within. 
5.   I have a ""Personal Katahdin"" that is close to the AT, located on Deer Mountain - Rangley, Maine. Located there is a Memorial Stone bearing the names of a WWII Bomber Crew; whose plane crashed at the Site. My Great Uncle was the Navigator on that plane and his name is engraved on the Granite stone. I would like to pay my respects on behalf of my deceased mom, grandmother, great grandmother and great grandfather before the family history is totally lost in time.
6.  Leadership has taught me to always seek the ""Why"" behind actions and behaviors involved in every day life. I need to reset, redefine and revitalize my ""Why?"". So in a way, ""I am hiking the AT to discover  Why I am hiking the AT"". 
When I successfully thru-hike the Appalachian Trail I Will:
1. Be more grateful for the basic things in life. 
2. Appreciate those ""God Moments"" (as my mom use to say) and the simple things that are often overlook if you're not looking and purposeful in your daily living.   
3. Recognize that Trail Magic and miracles occur in our daily living, and I want to recognize and  be grateful when they occur. 
4.  Not stress the small stuff of life and truly believe that it is all small stuff.  
5.  Be more patient and enjoy a slower pace of life; while not ruining it with self imposed guilt.   
I don't plan to give up on the Appalachian Trail so I skipped the last list. A coach once said, ""Don't phrase things negatively because an Athlete doesn't hear that word, but hears what follows.  So Don't Fumble the football becomes fumble the ball.  Don't drop the pass becomes drop the pass"". What does one say then?  State the negative positively,  ""Hold on to the football!"".  Or my favorite, ""Catch the damn ball!"". So in the end, I will thru-hike the dang Trail!",,View Entry,"Sep 24, Sun",0
gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578580,"On my weekly Tuesday Dayton Hikers Meet-Up Hike, I met my 1st Ridge Runner!  As we approach the 1/2 way loop, a woman was sitting and painting with a small pallet of Water Colors.  It was so peaceful, we were almost apologetic for intruding. However, other than being shy about her artistic skill, she immediately talk of being in Nature.  She just happened to be visiting her mother and had to get into the woods of her childhood.  She quickly shared that she was more of a hiker/backpacker than an artist; having thru hiked the AT in 2007.  Even though it was ten years ago, you could immediately tell the impact it had on her as a 53 year old, whose youngest son had just turned 18.  When asked if he joined her, she laughed and said, No that she went solo.  Of course some of my fellow Hikers asked about the risk of taking off by herself and her answer was very insightful.  She related that it was like Sunday Church; one goes by themselves but within minutes are surrounded by a community of believers.  She stated that the AT is its own unique community. A community she loved so much that she often returns to the trail as a Ridge Runner in the Mt Rogers Grayson Highlands Area.  She spoke of other Dayton Hikers we share in common, showing how small the world is; yet how large the AT community can stretch.  I must admit, I was somewhat in awe of this older lady and was apprehensive to share my plans for 2018.  However, sharing with her once again makes the Dream more real.  Especially, when she asked if I had a trail name in case we cross paths next year.  It felt surreal to say, ""gbolt"" as I hiked away, smiling at this chance encounter",,View Entry,"Sep 26, Tue",0
gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579094,"Today’s training hike turned into an opportunity to “Embrace the Suck”.  I have read many suggestions that one would be wise to go out in the hardest, coldest rain storm or put on wet cloths each morning, or sleep on a hard floor, to get an idea of what will occur on the AT.  Although I am not one to purposely create adverse conditions to appease these well intended people; I try to not shy from naturally occurring obstacles.  Such was the case, when I started today’s hike, in a gentle rain.   However, by mile 2, it was steadily increasing in intensity, at the same time an opportunity to bail to the car occurred. The other option was to play a mental game; telling myself that the next shelter was still 5 miles away.  I chose the mental game as an opportunity to push on and see if I truly could learn from the adverse conditions; and learn I did.  I learned that I love my Marmot Pre Cip. It did “wet through” and I did sweat lightly, but the pit zips are great, I can manage heat through opening and closing the front, I can slide arms through the pits or leave them in the sleeves and I love the hood over a ball cap.  It was 63* proving that I wouldn’t want to hike in a shirt and just get wet.  It’s not as much a matter of wet as it is wet and cold.  I also found out that the Z Packs Rain Kilt will be a beneficial piece of equipment, even though I didn’t wear it today. Because I didn’t wear it, my pants were totally drenched and heavy, slowing my pace. Although, hiking in rain should be slower as a way to avoid slips and falls.  A lesson I learned after I past the 6 mile mark. Coming down a set of man made steps, I hit the final plank and “whoosh” one foot slides out and I am down!  That quick!  It’s funny that I still had a thought of embarrassment, even with no one around.  I slowly picked myself up and learned that I can take a fall. I questioned if I should have used my poles or if that would have made a difference.  Next time, I will probably use poles in the rain.   At this point I almost bailed.  However, I still had 1 more mile to my mental shelter on the trail and a hill that I had planned on completing as part of my training. Climbing this hill provided me my last lessons for the day.  The trail was now flowing little rivers or standing pools of water.  I had often wondered how Thru Hikers just walked through these conditions?  Now, I know.  There is such a thing as so wet that walking through the water is less abrasive then side stepping and widening the trail.  Suddenly, the picture of me as a child splashing through rain puddles, popped into my brain and energized me with youthful freedom.  It was at this point that I looked to my left and saw a beautiful water fall. All summer, the falls were at most a slight trickle of water, as I previously passed by.  Now they were truly flowing and worthy of acknowledgement.  Once again proving that if one embraces the suck, there is a reward in accepting the challenge.  However, as much as I train (even in the rain), it’s still not the real trail.  I didn't end up at a shelter, but at my car, a quick drive home, and a hot shower.  Some things you can’t embrace for real until it is real.",,View Entry,"Oct 05, Thu",0
gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579718,"Just completed my Fall AT Prep Hike - 4 Days, 3 Nights in Red River Gorge Kentucky.  
The Lord does give you the lessons needed, whether you feel ready for the test questions or not.  Had to handle set-up in the rain on Sunday. This served as a base camp in the Koomer Ridge Campground, which was wonderful for simple adjustment of shelter system without tearing down and daily reset up.  It also allowed an 8 lbs Day Pack rather than a full 20 lbs Backpack.  The rain cleared in the middle of the night, creating beautiful hiking weather for the rest of the trip.  Highs in upper 50’s to low of 40* one night.  The lowest my 50* under-quilt can go without waking me (very good to know).  
Monday’s Hike was the longest at 15 miles; many on the Sheltowee Trace Trail that can be Thru Hike and is hopefully similar to the AT.  Tuesday covered 10 miles on various trails not as rugged as day one but still a good follow up without any trail legs.  The final morning was only 3 miles to play around the Natural Bridge State Park.  Put it all together and it was a great collection of steps, stairs, boulders, stone water crossing, rock crevice squeeze and moderate altitude changes in a beautiful scenic area.  
Hardest part of the exam for me was when God really smucked me.  To get the perfect picture of a waterfall; I leaned my trekking poles against a tree that also protected me from falling over a ledge.  While snapping the picture, the pole slid off the tree and plummeted down, down, down and splashed landed into the water.  1st thought, stupid is as stupid does, so don’t go with the pole! 2nd thought, I am out of $60; wonder if I can get a replacement?  Final thought,  maybe you can catch it down stream if you move quickly.  So a quick move (relatively speaking of course) to cross the steam, to get to the other flat level ground and move downstream, only to see the pole basket is hung up on the bottom of the stream, where it fell, with the cork handle tentatively flowing back and forth.  Off come the shoes, next the socks followed by tucking the pants legs (no time to zip them off).  Using the one safe pole, I stepped gingerly across to retrieve its counterpart.   Not to much of a cross to bare, water was about 60* and mid calf at the deepest point, sandy limestone bottom, with little too no current.  Amazingly no cussing and I actually was able to laugh a little, thanks to my patient fellow Hikers who captured the ordeal for future proof of my personal test anxiety.  They helped me to not repeat my error by reminding me to “Just let go of the poles and let them hang by the straps!”
Overall, I earned a “B” for this exam.  It wasn't true Backpacking but more like Nero’s. We bailed to a Subway for lunch one afternoon,  the texture of Oatmeal and the fishy tuna in Ramen just wasn’t cutting it.  I am going to have to watch my right knee on downhills; not sure but probably due to little to no cartilage left from a previous knee surgery in my younger years.  Still hate uphills and still get winded.  On a positive note, I did take a shower with signage that read, “Showers for Paying Campers only.” Found out other Hikers have to become “Paying Campers” for $5. Also found out that a person can almost dry off with a pack towel the size of a wash cloth.  I just wouldn’t want to unless the water and building are both heated!  If not, I would fail and not take that test!",,View Entry,"Oct 19, Thu",0
gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580567,"Continue to take shakedown hikes to better prepare for the AT.  Today was special because of doing a 12 mile loop that included a short section of the American Discovery Trail.  Very cool to follow a blaze and see an emblem: even one that is not nearly as recognizable as the AT emblem.  This was another chance to hike in the 35* to 40* temperatures.  I am amazed that all that is needed is a T-Shirt covered by my favorite piece of gear - an Orange Patagonia Houdini.  Love my buff and OR Swift Cap.  I found the head is the best way to regulate body temp.  I am purchasing what are called ""Sleeves"" to supplement my T-Shirt and possibly improve hiking in the 30* to 45* temperatures.  We will wait and see...  I also have ""Wristies"" that I have not had the chance to utilize as of yet.  I did sleep in them one night last January when the temp dropped to 28* but didn't own the Houdini or hike with them at that time.  Also am debating a 10 oz Fleece Vest that I feel may not be as useful as I once hoped.  The last one to two pounds are being closely scrutinized and constantly moving on and off my gear list.The other great thing I accomplished after the hike was placing the Pre Order for the 2018 AT Guide Book.  All paid for and expected to ship in mid January.  I included a 2nd Zip Lock Bag to hold the loose leaf pages for each specific day on the trail.  I previously purchased Guthook's AT app.  Between these two resources and based on the review of previous Thru Hikers, I feel very comfortable navigating the AT.  Although it's strictly voluntary, I also previously Registered as an A.T. Thru Hiker (Start Date March 16th), Registration #T483, thru the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.  Suddenly down to four months out, and with the holiday's, I am sure time is going to fly by for the next two.  I truly love this time of year and more miles, like today, make the Season Great.  I am very Thankful for this pre planning phase.","

Also, grateful that I have all of my gear purchased and now begins a process of refinement that won’t be completed until I am well into my Thru Hike, 112 days from now.  Not that I am counting!  
I am most grateful for the opportunity to have retired and be in a position to have a start date and even speak of attempting such a great adventure!  Just like the holiday season we have entered, I am praying not to rush through this time period; but instead to be grateful for each moment and learning to live in that moment.

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581188,"I've started to see people stating, ""One hundred Day's from my Start""!  I must admit, I was a little jealous; but then again, I did not choose an early start date. It seems each year people are heading out earlier and earlier.  More power to them.  I would have probably done the same if not for wanting my start to be a B-Day Celebration.  I also worried about the cold and snow.  I am more of a fair weather hiker, and actually with my thinning blood, I don't mind the heat as much.  
I also didn't choose 100 day's as a milestone; preferring to wait until Three Months or Ninety Days.  It has more impact for some reason.  When asked, ""How long does it take to hike the AT?"", most respond six months.  Thats why I started my Journal Six Months out.  Now we are three months away, so I am halfway prepared!  I love the sound - three seems small and within grasp.  Halfway sounds like there is still time to finish prep work.  But then, I start to get anxious...self doubt creeps in...and that is when I switch to, ""Oh I still have Ninety Day's"".  
Both sets of emotions (positive and negative) are helping to motivate me to continue to prepare but still find enjoyment in the process.  I have Vlogged my Gear List on You Tube and placed it here.  I feel pretty confident in my choices.  I also have my one night reservation at the Amicalola Falls State Park Lodge.  Took advantage of the Breakfast special!  However, I still read the cancelation policy because it still seems more like ninety day's and to far away to lock in.  
Finally, I marked the halfway point with two straight day's of higher milage hiking.  First day, 10.1 miles and the second day a 12.4 excursion.  I can't get the elevation change of the AT so I try to get between 3 to 4 miles per hour. I also took advantage of cold day's.  Both day's started in the low 20's with wind chill in the upper teens and neither day got higher than 30*.  I love the fact that if you get into the woods, it is never as cold as it is back in the city.  However, the wind still hits open spaces and up on a ridge for sure!  I still am amazed at how warm a layering system works, when hiking.  Base layer, Mid Thermal Weight Hoody, Outer Shell.  I found that my Houdini is still my favorite piece of gear.  I started both day's in the Marmot Precip but it was too hot.  I will save it for Freezing Rain or Snow Conditions.  The Wind Shirt is the way to go in my opinion.  I wore wristies both day's and love those to keep my hands warmer.  I tried Glove Liners but still struggled with cold fingers on the Trekking Poles.  I found wool mittens to be the answer and at times, even a little to much warmth.  My micro beanie is great under 25* but over that, my head gets hot.  I either pop it off for a few minutes or take it off and slide my buff up over my ears as ear muffs.  At times, I pulled the Buff up and used it as a face mask.  It is probably my second favorite piece of gear.  Finally, I learned to adjust body heat at the neck/chest level.  The 3/4 zip hoody was constantly being pulled up and down; as well as zipping and unzipping the Houdini wind shirt.  However, at no point was I ever freezing and or even cold.  I was chilled at the start and occasional stops, but warmed up quickly and easily.  What a confidence boost.  
Finally, both day's included a beautiful frozen water fall!  A simple payoff and blessing creating smiles with the miles!  Who could ask for anything more.  As we are only a little over one week / 10 day's from Christmas, I hope neither number stresses you out and that we all feel blessed with the true meaning of Christmas.",,View Entry,"Dec 15, Fri",22.40

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582107,"Why?
Such a powerful one word question?!  We may spend the majority of our time on the “What” but the “Why” is is way more important.  What we do in life is not nearly as important as why we do it.  Why we do anything in life, is driven by a specific purpose based on our core values and beliefs. The “Why” cuts directly to that purpose and gives meaning to our very existence.  
What I am doing is simply planning to hike the Appalachian Trail.  The question, “Why?”,  still cries out for a short quick concise response.   Yet, I struggle to to answer the question, “Why am I attempting to hike the Appalachian Trail in 2018?”.
With sixty days before my start date, this question weighs heavy on my mind.  While I have confidence in my Gear and also understand the physicality of this adventure; I am not as comfortable with the Mental Aspects that lay ahead.  
I mentally put a great deal of thought into my Trail Name (gbolt18) and I don’t plain on changing it when I hit the AT.  Mainly  because I am transitioning from a lifetime of work to a slower stage of retirement.  Turning 58, I am not totally ready to stop working, but am looking to carry my strengths from the past into a new situation or setting, free from constraints of a typical career or need for certain benefits, earnings, or wages.   Many say Thru Hiking is work and a job, so maybe this is the new setting I am looking for.  In the same way, I will transition the gbolt name to this trail job. My hope is that this process will help me avoid any negative, self loathing references, or other derogatory captions bestowed on me.  Yet, I still fear receiving the Trail Name, “Why Not”, because this has been my unreasonable response to this dreaded question of “Why?”.  However, “Why Not!” is to simplistic of an answer that disrespects the accomplishments of previous Thru Hikers.  This is not a simple undertaking, without risks nor is it easily achieved.  The number of people Starting the AT has been steadily increasing, however, the rate of success remains relatively the same at 25% and actually dropped from 2015 to 2017.  As the saying goes, “If you think you can or can’t, you’re correct”.  While I do pride myself on having PMA and Naming it to Claim it, I am not filled with such bravado that I don’t realize the risks involved.  Many of which, through no fault of my own, could drive me from the trail to become part of the larger 75%. With this in mind, I am careful to say, “I am Attempting a Thru Hike” and avoiding calling myself a “Thru Hiker”.  I love what I read somewhere:Tourist in Gatlinburg - “Are you a Thru Hiker?”NOBO - “No, I am not Thru yet.  Just stopping for resupply on my way To Katahdin.Also, the simplistic answer,  “Why not” defaults to a non chosen, nothing better to do, alternative scenario.  This doesn’t work for me either.  Although, I feel called to Hike the AT, I have chosen to answer that call, even if that sounds “unreasonable”.  Dang, another possible Trail Name.    However, this is not the same trail name as “No Reason”.  No means not having a reason.  I am sure I have reasons. I just can’t put a voice to them.  So I am without reason, which is to say, I am Unreasonable!  Just ask my wife! Who I feel is being unreasonable by sacrificing selflessly to allow me to even think of Hiking the AT! See two unreasonable people can be quite successful, at least we have been for 35+ year.  I don’t take lightly the sacrifices my wife has and is continuing to make so that this Dream can turn into a Reality.  Yet, this only causes me more anxiety as to Why I struggle with the question Why.  
In the end, I guess We Shall See.  No one knows what the future shall bring.  We just have to have Faith.  Faith in God, Faith in others we know as family and those that well soon become our Extended Trail Family, and  finally, Faith that the Trail will provide.

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582154,"I will turn 58, the day I depart from Springer Mtn.  Looking at data, I have discovered that I am part of the 50-59 Age group that accounts for 10 percent of AT Thru Hikers.  If interested, the largest is the 25-29 year olds at 27%; however if you add the group prior to and after forming an 18-34 year old age group, you have the biggest piece of the pie at 63%.  Of course the most important stat is the success rate which holds steady at 1 in 4 or 25 percent.  It is interesting that in 2016 and 2017 the number of NOBO's was the highest ever, yet the success rate dropped well below 25% (20% in 2016).  We all desire to be that ""1"" or part of the 25% success rate; yet, we all have different means to that end.  Reaching Katahdin (or not) is not alway's under one's control.  Injury is a reason that forced 48% from the trail.  Some would say that you can't help accidents and that is partially true.  However, I have chosen a 17lb base weight, a pack that rides well, and trekking poles to decrease my risk of injury.  I am currently conditioning and sampling shoe choices to aid in that regard, as well.  Weather accounts for 11% leaving; so I have chosen a Mid March (vs. February) start date and have researched layering systems and clothing options to hopefully decrease that risk.  Illness comes in at 6%.  The Sawyer Squeeze, Hand Sanitizer, and Hammock as a Shelter rather than staying in the Shelters are methods to hopefully lesson the risk of illness.  Many have questioned if I am minimizing the risk of Bears by taking Bear Spray.  Yet, I don't fear Bears as much as I do a much smaller organism, a Tick!  Lyme disease does scare me!  For that reason, I use Permethrin on my Pack, Shelter, Tarp and Shoes.  However, I debated spending $70 (ok, $69.95) on spraying my clothes.  Now you can ""do it yourself"" for about 1/2 the price; but once I discovered that treated Clothing can last 70 washings and I don't have to dry them in sub freezing temps, I was sold.  OK, my wonderful wife once again said, ""Go for it""!   So, I went to Insectshield.com, watched a video that is excellent for walking a novice through the process, and ordered my EZ Packet for 8 pieces of clothing.  I have received the Envelope in the Envelope, selected my 8 pieces of clothing (Two Shirts, Sleeves, Pants, Leggings, Shorts, and Two pairs of Socks) and took the pre addressed package to the Post Office.  Now I wait on the return of my clothing in 6-10 day's.  Overall the site suggest a 3 week window from start to finish.  Not for everyone, but at my age, I am hoping to do all I can to improve my odds.  Of course personal reasons account for 17% and none of us know how we will react mentally until we face the challenge of the trail.  Thus, I try and maintain my Faith and often catch myself using the phrase, ""God Willing"".  Our life journey itself is only through the Grace of God, in the first place; so Keep the Faith and Keep HikN^.",,View Entry,"Jan 16, Tue",0
gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582193,"Today (a Thursday) was the first conditioning hike of the week.  Since a weekend Snow and cold Spell, I really haven’t been feeling strong enough to risk getting a full winter cold (I also avoided crowds of people). However, cabin fever does set in after a few days away from nature.  The sun was shinning and there were Diamonds in the snow; however, there was still a Wind Chill Advisory for the morning.  The hike started with single digit temps and wind chill “feels like” below 0.  Definitely the coldest temps I have Hike in this winter.  I had to adjust some clothing because mine are in the process of being treated by InsectShield.  The only item I really missed was the Thermal weight mid layer.  I also used my Yak Trax / Trekking Chains for the 5 inches of snow and occasional ice underneath.  They do make a difference and my groin and hips felt good after the 9 1/2 miles, but I’m still not planning to take them on my Thru.  The Marmot Pre Cip over the Houdini is still almost to warm.  I had to leave the hood off and opened the pit zips to stay cool as the temps climb into the double digits.  Still have to play with whether I go with the Houdini, or the Pre Cip to match the daily temps under 20*.  Everything else work like it has in the past. The Buff / Neck Gaiter won the prize for best gear.  Anything that the wind hit, would almost burn, so the Buff was worn over the ears (under the Beanie) and pulled up and down over the nose and mouth, while trying to keep the cheeks covered.  I still believe a Balaclava would be over kill and better saved for night sleepware. So the Buff is number one and the hike was great up to sitting in the car to take off chains and snow gaiters.  The right boot chain was missing!  “Why me God!”.  What do I do now?  I guess I just wait till next week and maybe I’ll get lucky and someone will find it and leave it at the trail Head. Yea right!  My favorite HEE HAW line, “If it weren’t for bad luck, I’d have no luck at all!  I was too tired to go look for it.  I guess I will do without them.  Seems like pairs often are split - one sock, one mitten and now one boot chain; items that sure do lose their value when separated.  
It just so happened that I was out running an errand later in the afternoon, when I decided to drive to the parking lot, just in case it was under the car earlier.  Nope. Will maybe I will go to the top of the hill to see if it came off after I crossed the road.  Nope.  Will it’s 25* and other than my ears, I feel pretty good now, so looping back to the car to retrace my earlier steps would only be around a mile and a half total.  So off I went. Yet, I still almost gave up hope. Suddenly, walking carefully to get around a sheet of Ice - could it be - yes it is! One Black Yak Trac. Thank,you Lord!  
However, I felt convicted for the earlier “Why me”.  My mind slowed and asked itself, “What is to be learned from this?” Quickly, a quote I heard on another hikers channel (I wish I could give credit where credit is due) popped into my brain. “To be Grateful, all one has to do is turn the “I have too” into “I get too”.  Guilty, I felt like I had to retrace my steps to look for the lost Chain; instead of thinking, I get to hike another mile and a half to add to todays total. What a beautiful day it is.  I get to realize the importance of the Buff, Head wear,  and proper hiking shoes vs tennis shoes. Finally, I have a pair of legs to walk with or without Yak Trax  Others don’t have it this good. Finally, I don’t have to hike the AT; I get too!",,View Entry,"Jan 18, Thu",0
gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582688,"My mind is running just like Bill Murray’s Ground Hog Day; instantly replaying many thoughts and emotions generated by my 2018 Thru Hike. The start date just six weeks out.  With the arrival of the AWOL 2018 AT Guide I am reading and rereading the early chapters to coincide with my ATC Registration Plan.  I am Number 483 and I urge everyone to Register to help maintain and sustain the Trail for all the future Generations who want to experience any part of the Appalachian Trail Dream.   The Groundhog saw his shadow so he has predicted six more weeks of Winter.  I chose my Mid March date to coincide with my Birthday, as well as my fear of cold and attempting to avoid or minimize its impact.  A fear that I didn't have when young.  I can remember a Presidents Day - Father Son Camping trip that we stored meat in Ice covered rock crevices like a refrigerator. We also melted ice so the “Dads” could have morning coffee.  Cold and wet still didn’t force us from the trip and although the tent was cramp, it worked great to generate warming/drying heat.  However, now that I am Older than the “Dads” were at that time, I have come to appreciate the need for the warmth from my own coffee as well as other “Modern” Amenities that help me avoid and minimize my fear.  Maybe, those things merely increase sensitivity more than youth squelched the fear.  I must admit that I was getting anxious, envious, and even jealous of those starting now, mid February and early March; even with the Groundhog on my side!  These thoughts made me all the more excited for this years, GMO Frozen Butt Hang.  A Winter Test of my AT Pack and Gear, without a long hike and a car nearby to bail!  Last Year’s event wasn’t too frozen, with a low down to 26* at Bedtime and then temps climbing for the rest of the night;with the  following day’s high of 45*.   This year, the forecast changed by the minute from lows in the upper 30’s and dry to a winter mix with temps in the mid 30’s, to 1-2 inches of snow with temps just below freezing.  Such is Ohio Weather!  I packed my ULA Ohm, just as if I were leaving for Springer instead of a local Metro Park.  I yelped a little when the Luggage Scale Read 18.1 lbs without food, fuel, or water.  Below the Bill Murray 20 lb weight, that I couldn’t seem to break.  Every piece of gear that I have tested and retested both mentally and physically since the conception of this dream was included. I truly felt that this was it; any future changes would occur at Neels Gap or beyond.  How wrong I was!  It was a Great Weekend with great fellow Hammocker’s; yet still a challenge.  The temperature dropped to only a low of 33* but the wind followed by the Sleet/Snow Mix made this a very cold/wet camping challenge.  I have been in colder and wetter hiking conditions prior to this; however, I quickly learned that establishing camp in these conditions is a different skill set.  My finger tips struggled to make the fine motor skills necessary to manipulate the hardware for the Hammock and Tarp system to be set up or taken down.  Even simple Tent stakes with attached guy lines can be difficult to roll and put into a Tent Sac.  Finally, swishing Ice off a tarp like it’s a car windshield is not smart, even in wool mittens that still “work” when wet - NOT! I struggled to slide the Snake Sleeve back over the iced Tarp, rolling it up and stuffing it into the side straps of the pack.  Luckily, I carried it 1/4 mile to the car that had an Ice Scraper/Brush for clearing away slush, instead of 8-12 miles to another camp to replay the day all over again.  Thus, formulating my next fear, the fear of being able to do this day after day after day in all kinds of weather. Luckily Groundhog Day is just once a year and also just an old movie.  I have Six Weeks to work on both the old and the new fear; no longer jealous of those starting before me.  I wish them well on their Journey, as I do some more groundhog research for Rain Mitts and Possum Gloves.  Maybe I will get lucky and the Groundhog will get it right; Winter will end as I start the Trail.  We can all hope for a happy ending just like in the movies.",,View Entry,"Feb 04, Sun",0

Yet, just as quickly the beat of cold and rain pounds you back into believing Winter will never die.  I have fought off Cabin Fever by embracing the cold and wet, hiking during the day and being happy that I have four walls instead of three at night.  I have not written in this journal, out of respect for Opa, Zen and the others, that chose January and February start dates.  I saw a stat that said those who start those two months have only a 19% success rate compared to those that start late March, early April.  It was a factor when I set my date, which is now 3 weeks away. Much like Christmas, so short of a time period to finish final decorations, yet so far away you struggle to generate excitement, fearing it will never arrive.  That’s only the beginning of the AT illness.  You read journal entries of those on the trail, to see if their mileage can help you plan your first days. Your face is buried in Awols Guide and Guthooks App when you suddenly realize that the one Bear Canister Rule didn’t impact their options but goes into effect March 1st to block your best laid plans.  As the Fever rises, you stare at your Gear List much like a dieter staring at a scale, the pounds not changing and the calories of items in the pack balanced and steady.  Finally the Fever hits you hard as your face flushes and sweat pours out along your brow, as you struggle in the muck and mud of the late winter thaw and rain showers.  Your mind impacted by the Fever, consumed by judging if you are physically and emotionally prepared for this thru hike, and if you are, why aren’t you already on the trail?  Then you hear a simple dose of medicine, “Man, you are way overthinking this”!  While your mind races with this profound life lesson, you round a corner and see a Waterfall, whose beauty is derived from the very muck , mud and thaw that is causing your groin and hips so much pain.  Yet, suddenly that pain illustrates that you still have a few final tasks to finish, while enjoying the Spiritual build up to Springer Morning.  It will come, as will the Journey itself.  However if you push and struggle and overthink life, it will loose it’s trail magic that it so wants to provide.  We know how to physically prepare to avoid an AT Fever.  We understand that it is also a psychological battle to counter the AT Fever, but for these last few weeks, I must continue to be open to the spiritual aspects of the AT, otherwise I may miss the greatest Waterfalls, Peaks and Valleys of the Journey.  A holiday journey that, in reality, has already started, if I open my mind to it.",,View Entry,"Feb 22, Thu",0

I do double the 604 Amicalola Stairs and Hike 4.5 Miles, half of the climb to Springer Mountain. Starting Four weeks ago, I added the backpack to this hike hike as well as a few others in the weeks since. Yesterday and Today were the full load out Hikes with Water, Gatorade, Fuel and Food on top of my 18 lbs base weight for a total of 32.5 pounds. Not bad, but still a little high IMHO.  But the weight is what it is.  I have spent countless hours researching every item included and this is what it is.  However, I am more than willing to adapt, adjust and downsize as I learn directly on the trail.  There is only so much prep you can do while dreaming.  When the Dream becomes a reality, in a little less than a week, is when the true education take place.  I was slightly jealous of those that have gone the month before me; but these last few days have put me in my place and once again taught me patience, Faith and  to let the trail come to me and not try and control the Journey. Very difficult for a Type A,  very  Driven Individual that I have always been, prior to retirement.  However, I now see that when you let go of the control, not physical things but more mental/spiritual control, you will be given the Journey you are meant to fully enjoy. Then in reflection you will understand the trail magic blessings given so that you can more fully enjoy life itself.  This past week has been a “send off” celebration that I truly did not expect and am overcome with gratitude.   From my Guy Friends, that understand this minimalistic wild journey, to hiking partners that have listened to countless hours of gear discussion, food prep and freezer bag gourmet suggestions and the inexplainable draw of the AT; to my family that is truly sacrificing a great deal for me to turn this Dream into a reality.  I am enjoying these last days before my Wife drops me off at the Arch; but I am fighting off the sadness of time we will spend apart.  Others have truly sacrificed and given selflessly so I can selfishly take this journey.  I cannot explain it, yet I feel compelled to do this hike and totally believe that it’s purpose and instruction will be revealed as I head to Katahdin.  I truly believe that the Trail will provide and that all I can do is Keep the Faith and Keep HikN^.",,View Entry,"Mar 07, Wed",0

We just wanted you to know that we are not only excited for your big adventure but will be lifting you in our thoughts with prayers of strength, good health and a wonderful journey! What an amazing gift to yourself.  
I have no doubt you will be able to take each mile, each day, each hour as it comes and deal with all of the challenges head on as they occur.
Walking part of the Camino gave me just a small glimpse of the adventure in taking a new path and making a spiritual journey — what a beautiful experience is ahead for you!
Just remember, “Short cuts make for long delays”
I hope you will bear the gifts enclosed as they weight little, but hold great meaning from walking the Camino.  Tie to your bag or hiking stick and take with you the many prayers they carry. 
Know that we are here for your family and will help in any way we can!  Can’t wait to hear your stories!
Take good care of yourself.  Enjoy the journey, May God Bless and Keep you safe as you enjoy the beauty around you.

How much Food did I plan?  How far is the NOC and do I have the mileage to blow through and not stop?  Why didn’t I pay more attention to the Guide?  Questions, Questions, Questions, With some worry thrown  in!  I finally journaled some random thoughts (prayers) at 1:30 in the morning and did get some sleep.    But then this morning started off badly. The bear bag game down easily - way to easily and fast!  I thought I was stepping on the rope to stop it but was mistaken.  The food bag crashed to the ground and the hang rope flew to who knew where. Instead of being grateful the food is safe, I am grumbling about the cordage and the time wasted finding it.  No shocker to my family that has heard me grumble at stop lights or when forced to follow old people (well people Ten Years Older than me at least).  Wasn’t grateful when I found the cord either, and then realized the carabiner to hang the bag was missing and the cord was stuck. Now it’s a matter of pride and saving as much cordage as possible.  Kids need to stay in school and take geometry!  I wasn’t good at math, but then another Hiker (whose food bag came down next to mine, without issue) helped me create a pulley system, then using a stick as leverage to save our hands, we both pulled with all our might!  The cord finally submitted and dropped to the ground, revealing  my first gear failure. The biner on the Z Packs Bear Bag busted in pieces but the rope was still attached!  Italian (that’s the other Hikers trail name) showed me how he uses two biners on his ZPacks Bag and said he saw it in a you tube video. My wife’s gonna wonder how I missed watching that one, when I ignored her!  No praise or thanks-from me,  just another late morning start, in a bad mood, on a bum ankle. Yet, the morning hike was glorious with views right up to the tower at the top of Mt. Albert. The Tower was pad-locked but the view was wide open!  Great time and place to have lunch and I was actually earlier getting there than I thought. Unofficially,  there is a marking on the tower support that simply says “AT 100 m”.  I actually think 100 miles is a little further down the mountain trail.   I celebrated the accomplishment any way!  Yesterday was one week on the trail and today was 100 miles down. Yet my mind was still worrying about going to Franklin NC a typical town stop for Thru Hikers.  Tom from Vermont broke my mental wrestling when he spoke up.  Tom mentioned he was staying at Baltimore Jacks Hostel and wondered if I wanted the number.  Of course I said “no”!  But when a couple that hiked up to the tower Southbound talked about how easy it is to get into Franklin, I had second thoughts and finally for once in the last 24 hours, listened to the urging of the Spirit. Tom called out each number and I made the phone reservations. Then he asked if I’ld like to Hike together the rest of the day since we were both staying at the same hostel now!  He even waited when I made my afternoon water filtration refill. We split a candy bar after the last uphill of the day, and we’re camping at the same place, ready for morning breakfast, if I can break camp quickly enough.  Everything seems to be working out, even with my lack of Faith!  Oh, I had a near perfect Bear Bag Hang this evening!  Praise God!","Carter Gap Shelter

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584859,"Saturday Morning broke cloudy and dreary, but camp breakdown was so smooth. Quickly, I was at the highway where Tom had been hitchhiking for two hours without success. Not his fault, traffic going the other way and all Bass Boats heading to a tournament. I kept telling myself to “let it unfold” put it in God’s control. It still took patience (but only about half an hour) and suddenly the first hitch arrive. 1st Ride Robert, an Auto Body owner in Franklin, said that
He told his wife that if someone was there, he was going to pick them up!  We were there!  Not only did he take us the 11 1/2 Miles into town, but when Tom asked about the best place for bacon and eggs, Robert said, “I’m going to a breakfast at a Masonic Temple, if you want to join me?” Boy, did we!  The hospitality was great, the biscuits and gravy stuck to the ribs, and we were treated like celebrities instead of vagrants.  After that, Robert took us on a tour of the town, stopped by the Post Office for Tom, and shuttled us to the hostel.  He helped me by a quick chat to confirm that we need to do things God’s way! Robert certainly does and was such a great guy to be our first ride. He dropped us at  Baltimore Jack’s Hostel for a Zero day. The Hostel is owned by Ron Haven (super nice guy to talk to) but named in honor of his friend who passed away suddenly last year. Like Ron Haven Baltimore Jack was also a legend with Thru Hikers. Once in the room the usual chores began: unpacking to dry out gear, Laundry (Yes I did my own but didn’t separate a thing) Shower, and then a nice texting chat with Joanie.  Almost felt like I was interrupting her new solo routine, which put me in a good mood in an evil kind of way!  Then to a Brewery for a free lunch provided by the Nantahala Hikers!  Hot dogs in chili sauce, with chips, fruit, and plenty of homemade desserts.  The beer was craft and a little on the expensive side but had to order the AT 0110 (for mile 110). that was only brewed for today, I think. Great tasting though, more fruity than hoppie. Bought one for Paul (that he was nice enough to split with his wife Amber) for getting me through about three days of hiking and pulling me through Nor’easter Toby as we climbed out of Bly Gap.  The group made room for the old guy at the table. Others in the group were Sassafrass (my fellow Hammocker), Anna / Left Turn ( who also hammocks I believe), and Dustin (I call Dusty Rhoades after an old time wrestler) who is a cool dude from Michigan.  Then to ingle’s Grocery Store for two dinners, a ton of protein, bars for snacks, Gatorade for replenishing  electro lites, and Apple Cider Drink Mix for a hot drink at dinner that even taste good after it gets cooler. Oh, laffy taffy for the super long uphills to supplement my tootsie rolls.  I through out a bag of various hard candies that I tried to like but didn’t. So I am set to not resupply at the NOC if nothing goes out of the ordinary. Many are saying the Smokies are closed and impassable, so we all are discussing lower mileage days to gear back and let the Smokies melt a little. Next came Outdoor 76 Outfitters.  I would have loved this store when gearing up for the trip, however, all I needed was a small #1 S-Biner, to replace the one that went to my Z Blast Food Sac.  Oh, I also got the 2018 Outdoor 76 Bandana that all the Thru Hikers are sporting. (See Alicia, your Dad can be fashionable!) Oh, speaking of being in-style, Amber set up a fake-book account with me!  That moves me into at least the 90’s if not 2000. Later I walked maybe a mile down the road and back (I know, amazing! At home, no way without a car) just to get a fountain Coke. Of course I was pulled in by the Lure of Dollar  General for an ankle compression brace and Come to think of it, that’s where the laffy taffy came from. Tom and I finished the day at Cafe Rel on the suggestion of Amber. She said the “Locals” raves about it and that it had even been featured on the Food Network’s - Dives Diners and what ever the rest is...  It was even better than expected!  Great Bread to dip in Basil, Tomato and Olive oil to start. Then a lush garden salad and then a Gyro Sandwich!  Mouth still watering now!  However, the Cafe does not take reservations or Credit Card, so Tom was stuck without an ATM card or method to pay!  Suddenly, our Dutch table for two, became a Dinner Date (according to Amber) lol. It’s all good, Tom will pay it back some how up the road and if not, it has been a pleasure hiking with him. Well it’s “Hiker Midnight” and we have an early morning start to get to the Free Baptist Pancakes and Eggs Breakfast before we get shuttled back to Winding Stairs Gap.  Sorry so long and maybe boring, but I really wanted to capture the relaxing atmosphere of the day and the hospitality of the people of the great City of Franklin!","Winding Stairs Gap

Great story to introduce it and not preachy at all!  The Church started the breakfast 10 days ago and they plan on doing it daily for 4 weeks straight.
Ron Haven drove the huge shuttle back to the trail head at 9:00. He gave great info to get to the NOC which doesn’t cater to Hikers, but is more for River Activities.  Can’t believe I am Excited to head out of town and back to the wild!  Franklin is my Number 1 Trail Town, currently.  It’s strange to watch the procession of Hikers as they head up the hill. I drop about 3/4 of the way back and get into my stride.  Not bad for 58!  I was able to hike solo up to the goal of Wayah Bald.  First we had to get over Siler Bald which Cost me  time taking a slight detour. You see, I love bacon but it doesn’t always agree with me. I shouldn’t have had it at breakfast but couldn’t resist,  which suddenly resulted in my stomach churning and a quicken pace to find a facility.  Much like when you are on the Highway and See a Rest Stop Sign - 2 Miles and for a brief 3/4 of a mile you’re  relieved but then fear sets in that you may not make it!  For me it was the Siler Shelter sign and shelters include a Privy.  At this point I was hurting and singing “Agony” just like the Musical, “Into the Woods!” Where I didn’t want to go! I will spare you the details. However, If you enjoy Junior High Humor and a good poop story I will finish this below, under the Title: Does a Bolt Poop in the Woods?
Coming back from my Siler Shelter detour, I walked past Siler Bald, figuring that we were clouded in and it wasn’t worth another side trip.  Instead I hiked onto Wayah Gap for a quick roadside snack.  Then I started a long, long, long, grueling unexpected climb. The funning thing is that the Trail parallels a road that can be used to drive up to the top. However, I am sure the road is a longer winding route and not so much straight up!   Lucky me!  Then again I got to...(ready NHS English Department) “Take the Road Less travelled!”  It was a strange trail. At times it was so smooth it was like walking on Palm Leaves for a Palm Sunday Stroll. Other times, it was brutal with rocks, downed trees and steep ruts.   This donkey preferred the palm leaves. Once I climbed under a tree that caused this Lutheran to kneel, and then when I stood up, my knees felt like the tin-man needing the can of oil. On I trudged. But actually appreciated the cloudy day, because trees bore scars from being burnt by the recent fires. Many were then toppled by hurricane strength storms. If the Sun would have shown, there was very little cover. A long way from a Green Tunnel here.    Finally, I popped out on the road, just down from the Wayah Bald Tower, and immediately two elderly ladies stared at me in shock. Finally, one asked if I had just come all the way up that trail? I simply replied yes, and the other stated her knees were sore and she just walked a few feet from the car! I assume the ladies where Grandmothers with the younger mom, two boys, and Dad.  The dad spoke up to save me by asking if I was a Thru Hiker, but this threw the ladies into a real tizzy.  Suddenly I was both an oddity and part of a bunch of family photos.  When I mention to the mom that last Sunday I had a 5 minute church service on a rock above Neels Gap, but this Sunday was Palm Sunday Service all day long,  she sent her song to race back to the car to get me a present.  Felt sorry for the boy, but he did it in stride.  I continued up to the Tower, filming and explaining how the fire and storm devastation caused me to understand today and this Lent season even more clearer.  Yet, there are signs of Resurrection in some new growth and a new Tower Roof.  The View was clouded over some, yet you could see some of the mountains we have climbed and some yet to come. It wouldn’t have been appropriate for a clear blue sky revealing all of God’s Glory. That maybe can wait for next Easter Weekend.  By the time I came back down the steps and stopped video taping, the Mother presented me with a Palms Sunday Cross she had hand-made and that had been blessed earlier this morning.  Now I am not up to date with all this formal blessing and stuff, but it was a cool experience.  I had my one and only Picture on the Bald, taken with it in my hand. Next came shouts of “gbolt!” from Tom and the community of Hikers that had beat me by a long shot to the top.  It was a quick turnaround because they had been there awhile even though I had just arrived.  No time to waste, it was decided to do another 5 or 6 Miles (not sure, and didn’t care) to a Shelter stopping point to set up the NOC for tomorrow.     I struggled the last two miles because of using up all my water and not wanting to stop.  When we hit the shelter and the water was overflowing, I was ready to drink.  However, the urge to hit the privy was stronger so you could say the hike ended close to the way it started.  Now I warned you about Part Two (pun intended) so read on at your own risk.  
Does a Bolt Poop In the Woods?
When younger, the answer was an easy yes!  But that was without any knowledge of “Leave No Trace” and definitely not very sanitary. We never used TP, instead finding leaves even if it turned out to be poison ivy a few days later. Messy Tidy Whities were what moms handle discreetly by washing or pitching and we were none the wiser.  Finally, a case of “Swamp-A** Back then was cured with a shower the second we got home! Yet, on the trail as an adult, I couldn’t afford a mishap which is why I quick-stepped it towards the shelter Privy praying for “Farts” not “Sharts”.  I didn’t check the guide, but it must be the longest side loop ever and located on the far side of the Bald itself.   It became apparent that I wasn’t going to have the luxury of a Privy Throng and was going to have to do it in the Woods.  I look up from the trail, “No way”.  I look down and start hopping side to side while seeking privacy ( more for the respect of others than my own personal long gone dignity) while not losing sight of the trail and getting lost.  On the way down, I am debating the, “Hug and Dump”, the “Catcher’s Squat n Dump” or the “Full moon over the Log” method. I chose the latter and got busy digging the required six inch deep depository, although at this point I am ready to explode and don’t much care where it goes. Insert America’s Most Wanted videos of animals doing the dump at this point.    However, had this been recorded I could win!  Surprisingly, I hit the target, cleaned with TP and Baby Wipes (so glad I  am not that much of an ultra lite hiker that
would worry about the weight of wipes).  I then pulled up my hiking pants a proud man!","Winding Stairs Gap

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585001,"Let me start today with a story I didn’t get to tell yesterday.  When I met the two elderly ladies at Wayah Bald Tower, they wanted a picture with me in the middle.  No problem.  Except the one lady on my right simply angled her body and let her arm hang behind me. I put my arms on the back shoulder of each lady shoulders so as not to offend.  When I did this, the lady to my left schooched right in and went to put her arm around my back. However, the pack was in the way so she kept dropping it lower and lower and lower until suddenly she realized she wasn’t on the pack anymore but was fully on my bum!  The shock on her face was historical.  She apologized profusely and I joke about these miles hopefully making it firmer for my Wife!  She then asked if my Wife really let me go on this long trip and once again I knew how special my gal is!  Along the same vein, at Lunch Today, Tom was sitting on a ledge calling the postmaster to correct a mislabeling and arrival timing of two resupply boxes. He also mention his wife and daughter having some home  struggles of there own. At that point I had to say a prayer for all spouses of all Thru Hikers. They are special and without their support we would not be hiking.  No matter how much of a strain the
Logistic were
On Tom, he was still sitting on a ledge looking over beautiful Mountains! Life ain’t all bad in the Woods! 
Today’s hike was probably appropriate for the Monday of Good Friday Week.  I thought 
yesterday’s hike went through some charred areas, but that didn’t come close to the fiery detestation and distraction today.  The one unexpected good surprise was the view from Wesser Bald Tower! The platform allows a 360 degree view.  Gorgeous, simply Gorgeous.  But that was the last Hiking highlight. The next miles went along a narrow knife edge ridge-line through destroyed and toppled burned out stumps and small shrubs.  Once finished with the ridge, a sharp but long, long, long decent occurred. Now, I have come to love the downhills and enjoy letting the momentum carry me. However, there was no such thing allowed today.  It was a technical slow process dropping lower and lower in elevation.  My knees just throbbed from the jarring and my Hammie’s rebelled at having to fight the momentum that it was use to using to move quickly. I really questioned my mileage and choice for the
Hike today.  However, before I could hit mental rock bottom, I literally hit the Gap and suddenly the oasis of the NOC (Nantahali Outdoor Center) drew my Spirits back Up!  Nothing like seeing my hiking group sitting in chairs along the raging river.  Packs off, shoes drying, and the majority opening resupply boxes sent before leaving home. I didn’t pre-send one for myself and it was the correct decision for me.  I am carrying too much as is.  I did hit the store for an Orange Crush drink and Oatmeal Cookie, as well as a clean Smart Water bottle to replace mine.  I then headed to the Outfitters Store for a small canister of back-up fuel and then splurged on the smallest Platypus Collapsible Drink Bottle they had. I have been out of water in the late afternoons and haven’t stopped because of time constraints.  This way I can simply fill and attach the filter to this bag and drink on the go.  I still like my DIY Hydration bottle but feel this will be a good supplemental option. Then back to the Adirondack Chair to let my feet breath and dry out.  It is a truly beautiful setting and on a warmer day I could have sat and watched kayaker’s on the river all day long.  However it wasn’t in season and slightly chilly, so the group crossed the water bridge, hopped over the Train Tracks and started to climb.  The decent into the NOC is matched by the climb back out.  However, I did feel rejuvenated from my time there, as well as a great, conversation with Sassafrass to keep my mind off the groans of my body. She is having tendonitis issues and so luckily her climb rate matched a 58 Year Olds!  We didn’t climb too far, maybe a mile or so, and came across a gated road that led to our stealth site for the night.  The climb still looming in the morning.  However, with everyone overly resupplied and no one wanting to carry all this food weight, it was decided that dinner would be a communal affair. A feast for the hiking Kings and Queens, and boy was it. There were even two boxes of Wine for the Six of us!  The best part was toasting our Journey and the time together.  It is a unique group with Paulie and Amber, Dustin, Sassafrass, Tom (now known as recon for heading up to find this perfect camp spot) and last of all, gbolt.","Cold Spring Shelter

Camp breakdown was smooth and getting quicker. I am sure, lack of cold numb fingers made all of the difference. Getting into a routine for packing up, retrieving the Bear Bag, and then a stop at the community gathering spot for a Pop Tart Breakfast.  I beat the 3/4 number, moving to 1/2 as the 3rd person out of  camp, figuring I would quickly be passed on the uphill climb.  Turns out that today was nothing but continuous uphill. The highlight Vista was to have been Cheoh Bald but it was fogged in!  I must say on the slight down hill from the high elevation I was bummed.  Then a thought struck me!  I just touched the Clouds! How many people can say that!  The thought propelled me on but it was difficult trail at best.  We had lunch at Locust Grove Gap and I got to chat with Tank and Tagalong, the Dublin, Ohio guys that I ate dinner with at Daniel’s Steakhouse back in Hiawassee. We discussed Jacobs Ladder; but the younger one’s didn’t seem to know much about it and it isn’t mentioned in Guthooks App.  So off we went climbing out of this Gap and dropping into Stecoah Gap, which actually is a road and small picnic area off to the South Side. Everyone’s spirits seemed good with only 2.3 miles to the Finish for the day.  Little did we know that 2 of the miles would be almost straight up!  Ladder is the Correct term because your foot is using a root, log, or actual trail step to get to the top. I wasn’t even 1/4 of the way up and was ready to curse the Mountain!  Then suddenly we all heard tires screech, metal mash, brief silence, then more metal scraping and bashing.  The final staccato was a horn that constantly blared for the next 3/4 of the mountain.  I said a prayer for the people associated with the cars, and felt kind of Sheepish at my attitude towards Jacob’s Ladder. How fortunate was I to be climbing this mountain, when moments before, I had been at the very Gap of the Accident.  How fortunate am I to be out here at all! Fifteen minutes later and really not the much higher, due to the slow going,  we heard the sirens of the First Responder’s and once again I prayed that their life saving skills would be beneficial and that no one was seriously injured. We shall never know, but I know my Prayers were heard!  Finishing the hike up after the accident, I thought back to a Memorial that I had past by at the beginning of the day.  It was for Wade Sutton, a Firefighter who lost is life close by so that others can more fully enjoy the AT.  His sacrifice is not without value because I am totally enjoying the AT.  However, this Memorial and Accident reminded me of a Man on a Cross that Sacrificed his Life so that we can live life more fully not just life here on the AT, but Life Everlasting!","Stealth Camp

And what you've been out there searching for forever Is in your hands
And when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else seem so small”.  I was amazed looking down on Fontana Lake so small and so far away.  I figuratively towered over it.  Hours later when hiking the trail along the edge of the Lake, suddenly it is expansive and I was the small one. The only difference was a change in perspective of the situation. I am surprised to have built some great relationships but tonight is the last night together; as the younger generation must “fly the coupe” into the Smokies.

Then again, I swear my wife is hearing things when she states my snoring keeps her up at night.  Last night wasn’t the greatest sleep, very chopped up, waking every time I had to switch from back to side to back to opposite side.  I took a midnight walk up to the Solar Powered Rest Room, not so much to use it; as to stretch and breath fresh night air.  It was still needed practice for the Smokies where there are rules trying to force everyone into Shelters until they are fully loaded.  The Smokies also require a $20 Permit that allows eight days to get through the Park.  I got it back at the Top of Georgia Hostel when I was still riding high - fresh from Springer.  After the NOC, you start to settle into an early hiking groove which is lacking most of the early excitement adrenaline.  I think my DIY Barca Lounger with the Sit pad for my bottom will work great.  I used my soft hammock in its stuff sac for under knees and my thermal Jacket to cushion my heals.  The S2S Aeros Pillow worked will but even better when I added the Z Pack Pillow Sac after my midnight stroll.  I did fight moving the “Sit Pad” from butt to shoulders and back and forth, depending on which screamed the loudest.  Hopefully that will be remedied with the discarded 3 - Panel Pad some one cut off to save weight and place into the Hiker Box (A Community Chest where you take something that you need and leave something that you no longer use or want to carry). Once again, Prayers are answered and needs are met before you even know it, on the Trail.  Although I woke at 5:30, I didn’t have to rush to hit the Trail Like everyone else.  Instead, I had a leisurely Breakfast of Oatmeal (Which will be the last until it doesn’t feel like soft cereal that hasn’t grown up to be crunchy yet or chose to do the opposite and go soft and creamy)and Coffee with Sugar as we watched the Sunrise from the East end of the Lake.  Then the pack was cleaned out and repacked, followed by a shuttle to the Fontana Lodge and a Second Breakfast of Eggs, Bacon, Potatoes, and more Coffee with cream and sugar!  Ahhh the simple things of life.  Checked into the room, start charging electronics drained on the trail and then Laundry time next to the General Store.   Four sets of machines, Dryers on Top of Washers and only ONE Set Works!  Kind of Frustrating for an hour job to take three and a half while you wait your turn.  But a hiker (splitting room cost with Recon and I) named Cold Coffee simply said, “Dang, machines not working - I guess we just have to sit here on the porch in Rocking Chairs Drinking Coke and eating chips for the rest of the morning”. Suddenly, my attitude improved with this new way of viewing things.  After purchasing a Coke I step out of the store and into the porch and couldn’t believe who was coming up the Steps.  None other than the Two Ladies and the rest of the Palm Sunday Family!  What are the odds!  of course more pictures but this included almost all the Thru Hikers on the porch because most were the same as Wayah Bald Tower.  I hope they enjoy the rest of their trip and have a Blessed Easter! We then started playing spades (I think I have played in the past but had to relearn it) and actually we’re kind of sad to hear when the clothes were finished drying.  We decided that we better eat lunch and chose the “Pit Stop” a Gas Station that’s converted to meet any Village Travelers needs!  I had a Sausage Dog with Chili and Cheese for just over $3 and I was in heaven.  I really am trying to put back on weight lost on the trail.  I can tell because my Town Columbia ZIP Offs Pants are really getting loose and baggy.  Back to the room to gather and open the Resupply Box sent from home.  This was necessary to provide food to get through the Smokies and not have to pay the 30% to 50% higher fee’s here in the resort.  Although, there selection is better than what it was in the old days. Thanks for the Easter Candy Hun!  Next thing you know, time for dinner at the new Grill that just opened for the season!  Life is better on a full stomach I must admit.  Suddenly, Thunderstorms rolled through and we were glad of our decision to Zero while still praying for our fellow hikers up in the mountains!  Running back to the lodge through the rain, changed our mood back to seriously game prepping for the Smokies early in the morning.  I had blisters to tend to, followed by a last shower, then taping of toes and feet before slipping in sock liners and falling asleeeeeppppl","Fontana Hilton

So quietly Recon and I left CC and Suga in the room and headed for lobby coffee and some last minute internet work, especially catching up on Jimmy’s Channel with Thru Hiker Interviews.  Check them out, very interesting before I got on the trail and now even more so. Back to the room around 6:30 to finish pushing items into the pack to take back to the lobby, killing time before breakfast and the 1st 8:30 Shuttle back to the Hilton.  We had to make sure we past all  the white blazes down to the Dam.  Then across the dam, up the hill and permits into the box that we previewed by Van yesterday.  Hating to leave the comfort of the Lodge and the ease of the Zero. Pack is extra heavy on food and Easter Peanut M&M’s that my wife snuck into the resupply box.  Excited to enter the Smokies, which hold so many previous memories, including our Honeymoon, trips to my parents camper over in Pitman Center, Family Spring-breaks and the last trip to Clingman’s and Newfound Gap with my oldest daughter.  Yet other than a few feet that can’t be avoided; I have stayed off the AT in this Glorious Mountain Range in anticipation of this Thru Hike.  Today is the Good Friday to do just that.  I am sure I will spend time hiking in reverence of all that is good and bad about this day.  On the walk down to the dam, a rainbow kept trying to appear over the monstrous structure.  Recon tried to capture it in pics before it disappeared. I may have gotten a shot of it with the American Flag flying outside the visitor center.  It is amazing the size of the complex and walking across the Dam was a thrill.  So. was dropping half  of the permit into the box marked “Thru Hikers”.  I am starting to feel like one but still have a long way to go!  Then started the 10 mile climb to Mollies Ridge, which is no exaggeration, it just seems to take forever, even though the grade and switch backs are designed will. Not any where near as hard as climbing Jacobs Ladder, but still the toughest climb is the one in front of you. I missed the side trail to Shuckstacks Fire Tower.  Wasn’t meant for me, I suppose and maybe to Smokey for a view.  It was crazy because off in the other direction  I saw a cloud bank and watched it edged on course to smack the mountain I was on.  Just after I Reached Mollie Ridge Shelter (which was skipped in favor of the next, because of bear activity) I walked about 25 feet.  Suddenly, I was being pelted by Rice size Hail / Sleet!  I could feel the forecasted temperature drop from 51 down to 38 degrees at this point.  While I kept my head down and moving, I glanced at my watch. 3:00 on the dot.  Then suddenly a thought filled my brain, prophecy is fulfilled with the piercing of the side of our Lord Jesus Christ!  What a Spirit Filled time hiking at that point.  It wasn’t til 15 or 30 minutes later that things lightened a little and a sense of peace came for those that believe in the death and resurrection of Christ.  All I could do was keep the faith and keep hiking north.","Fontana Village Lodge

I am making due but my hips are too old for these wooden floors.  Got up early enough to have coffee and a Honey Bun. Love those in the morning.  No matter how smashed they get, the flavor is still in them!  Plus, I’ve noticed I am eating on more of a schedule and consuming more, so maybe Hiker Hunger is Setting in. At Derrick Knob Shelter, while talking to Forest Ranger, I busted out the Easter M&M’s. Boy are they good! We had a Ridge Runner at the Shelter yesterday, and the Ranger working two shelters behind, but none where we’re at Tonight. They often do have good intel to pass on and they love to have our input, for the most part.  The highlight of the morning was standing on Rocky Top were the actual song was penned. I thought of the two greatest Vols fans I know; my Dad and my oldest daughter. I had to have my pic taken in Tn. Orange and of course sing to irritate a Bulldog Fan!  We at least agreed that neither of us like Bama!  Then it was long peaceful  Miles hiking in my beloved Smokey Mountains. We were going to stop at Siler Bald but decided to add 1.7 miles to make the morning hike to Clingman’s faster in the morning.  I am so glad we did, because the views were Glorious. The Ridge was narrow, so we had Tn to the Northeast on our left and then NC to the Southwest to our right.  Simply Glorious!   Arrived in camp a little before six, so the clock was
Running to get the hammock set, dinner fixed and ate and  get myself to sleep for an early Easter Morning!","Russel Field Shelter

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585498,"The day started with Recon shaking my Hammock at 4:30 a.m.  Quickly broke camp in the dark and started for Clingman’s Dome. Headlamp wouldn’t work so I stumbled until I had to stop.  Warmed the Batteries in my pocket, prayed and then tried again. Let there be light and there was!  Off we went for the long uphill climb.  The view of the cities to the North was unbelievable!  Great motivation to get to the Top.  Popped out of the trail onto pavement, dropped the packs and climbed the Spiral Case!  So windy and actually cold but nothing could spoil the Sunrise Service.  As the sky lightened we watched a storm drop rain to the north and dissipate as the Sun rose to the East.  So Special and Glorious.  He Is Risen!  
Then the race was on to Newfound Gap. Although we did pass the 200 Mile Mark shortly after coming off the Dome.  It was surreal coming off the trail and crossing the road at the Gap.  I’ve driven there many times but this is the first for feet!  While sitting on the wall eating lunch a beautiful vintage 65 Mustang Convertible Pulled up and asked if we were Thru Hiking.  Dean and Karen Fontaine said they had trail Magic and a ride later if we wanted. Did we ever. They are locals from Alcoa and are planning to hike the AT in the future; so in the meantime they are helping spread Magic now!  Dean is a Paramedic/Firefighter, so on the way down to Gatlinburg, he shared insight into the devastating fires a year and a half back.  Chimney Tops didn’t even look the same.  Neither did much of the mountains surrounding the town. They dropped us at the NOC showing once again that people will amaze!  Tom picked up his package and I went crazy in the store.  I got a Neo Air for the Shelter Floors (tried for the light weight small but they only had the one in the store. Must be a hit ticket item or “sucker” is written on my bald head!). Purchased $4 pair of folding scissors because the ones in the cheap micro tool didn’t cut toilet paper that tears on everyone!  Finally, purchased a $25 dollar fanny pack, I mean “Men’s Pouch”, I mean “Man Purse”.  K, there is no way to make it sound or look masculine, but the $8 Walmart Special wasn’t up to the rigor of the trail, but did show the value of this item, time and time again.  Then it was a march downhill to stoplight six and the Johnson Inn. It was surreal to be doing this in a pack and dodging the people all over the sidewalk, although I still felt at home, here in the town.  A hot shower was first on the agenda and then dinner followed by laundry.  I can’t tell you where or what we had for dinner because my Oldest will disown me!  Recon loved the Southern Fried (stuff) though.  Plus the Crafted beer hit the spot! Stop at Walmart for Vitamin I (Ibuprofen) for pain and anti inflammation. Early bedtime whether on Trail or in Town it seems.","Double Spring Gap

Like a invisible seal, I tore past the sign and for the first time proceeded up the Trail!  1st Stop - Charles Bunion (named after my father Chuck’s foot).  I believe it may be one of the most beautiful Spots in the entire park.  Slightly scary climbing out onto the rock outcropping but so beautiful.  The rest of the day turned into my best hiking day on the trail!  Great trail made of cobble stone rocks, soft dirt, or bed of pines!  Views at every turn. First to the West then back to the East. A narrow ridge edge but well maintained with logs and stone.  We stopped at Pecks Corner Shelter (are 1st option) but it was only around 2:30 and too early. Filtered fresh water and then on our way for the next shelter 5 miles away. We past one view that I had to take a picture and then realized that it is the same vantage point as a picture hanging over our fire place! So cool to know where the framed picture came from and now I have my own pic to compare!  Late in the day, the uphills still let you know this is work not just a walk in the park, but overall, my best day yet!  Legs are strong, breathing is good, pack is riding better on the hips and the fanny pack is riding up and away from the pack belt. Recon and I joked with Tank and Tagalong (met back up after our zero in Fontana and their zero in Gatlinburg) about slowing down to a snails pace and hiding until we could be the last into camp and forcing them into the shelter, while we camp out!  As it was, people were already tenting, so everyone scattered  and found a spot for the night.  We did chat with “Pappy” who is 87 years old and trying to break Dale “GreyBeard’s” record for oldest AT Thru Hiker.  It was interesting because he has already hiked the CDT and the PCT and he said the AT is much more demanding. Tomorrow is probably our last day/night in the Smokies.  I really have felt at home here, so on to new and exciting points along the AT.","Newfound Gap/Nero Gatlinburg

The highlight of the day was the .6 Miles (not AT Miles though) to Mt Cammerrer Tower. It was sure worth the extra 1.2 Round Trip. A 360 Degree building with a 360 Degree deck around it, all built on Rock. The structure was beautiful and the view went on for miles.  You could even see I40 looping through Newport Tn. It left us in a great mood.  So great that when we hit the last shelter in the Smokies, we kept in hiking.  Right to the permit box for southbounders and out to the road that served as the park boundary.  There was Bags (who Thru Hiked last year) with Trail Magic!  A lawn chair, beer, chips (3 bags for me) and of course my favorite fruit a Cutie Orange.  Great Coctail Hour but we had to get moving to find a camp for the night.  My elation only increased as I came down and walked over the Pigeon River and the under I40, that I have drive over quite a few times. So surreal and so cool. Rafters were coming off the River at the same time and spot!  Yet, it was still sad to be out of the Smokies that truly feel like a home away from home. Although I have even more memories now that I have done the AT through the park. The only problem is that it is an immediate climb away from I40 and the noise of 18 wheelers.  It left me tired, drained, and didn’t allow much time for a restful dinner.  The day  ended at Standing Bear Resort that was booked solid except for $15 Camping.  I tried to hang a hammock but just know good spot.  CC went back down the road and stealth off to the side.  I ended up going to the ground with my Palace Tarp set up, using the Neo Air Pad I bought at the NOC but never had to use it in the Smokies.  It was good to not have to worry about the Shelter rules now that we were out of the Smokies.  I couple of slices of pizza and a bandanna and I was set for a good nights sleep.","Tri-Corner Knob Shelter

However, the Tarp set up kept me dry and I slept pretty good on the Neo Air/Barca Lounger Pad.  I still hate crawling around on the ground!  Had real brewed coffee and a Honey Bunn for breakfast so that made the wet morning tolerable. We continued the long climb up from I40 and turned to the north. At the top Recon looked at AWOL’s Guide and said Snow Mtn.  I said FAA Tower and we both heard it humming up a side trail behind us.  We turned back and walked the short distance, seeing it take shape in the fog and mist; like some alien spaceship. It actually was quite cool for a couple of guys, young in Spirit, taking us back to the days of our youth!  Another 4 or so miles and it was lunch at Groundhog Shelter. This allowed a sit down meal at a picnic table where we met Salty Dog who was stopping for the day due to a bum ankle. I understand with my right one rolling once to twice a day.  I also woke up with a Sore Throat so Recon kept me supplied with Ricola Cough Drops from Gatlinburg.  After lunch, the March was on to Max Patch as the highlight of the day. It is a Grassy Mountain too that at one time was used to graze cattle.  The view was to be amazing because the morning weather broke and we had blue skies.  We would catch a glimpse of it and think it was close.  Only to round a corner and lose sight of it. Then loop back around and there it was, almost like you could touch it. But then down into a gap and it would be gone. This went on for two and a half hours!  We finally came to the road that leads cars to a parking lot at its base; and Doesn’t Talk was giving out Trail Magic.  He suffered a stroke but was still using a van and helping out Thru Hikers!  A small Cutie Orange, but so good and sweet!  We crossed and headed up the last .9 to the elusive Bald.  It was worth the wait.  360 degree view all around. I loved looking back to the Smokies we had just conquered.  God’s Creation circling us in all directions.  I expected Julie Andrews to come running over the crest singing, “The hills are alive, with the sound of music”. The only bad part w as the wind!  Cold and could blow you off your feet, so our stay was cut short, as we sought shelter from the wind below the Summit.  It was cool walking down and still seeing the Bald extend into sections of the valley below.  We took advantage of cell coverage and set up the Laughing Heart Lodge for the day after tomorrow.  Probably a second 15 in a row, followed by a short 4 mile Nero into Hot Springs. We pulled into the Roaring Forks Shelter about 5:15 for a relaxing evening, but the wind is still howling and being a cold front with it.  Temps are to drop into the low twenties tonight.  We just can’t escape winter’s grip!","Standing Bear Hostel

My sore throat froze, but turned into a head cold today.  Recon gave me Chicken Soup for dinner, so we shall see if it works.  Nothing special today. It was about getting close to Hot Springs for an almost zero tomorrow. There was a climb up Walnut Mtn that ended in a small Bald without a view.  The entire Mtn has to have caught fire recently; we even saw left over “Escape” tape to show an exit down to a hollow and water to help.  That was one great thing about today, some small waterfalls and lots of streams.  I love the sound of rolling water.  So peaceful and relaxing. Of course there are numerous biblical references to streams.  My legs are stronger, my breathing is better, but the uphills still slow me to a snails pace with a stop on a log every now and then.  It is amazing, when you hit a point where you are going so slow you might as well be stopped, there is a log or rock there that seems strategically place just for you!  I don’t think it’s a coincidence.  The good Lord provides!  My toes are much more rugged and callous, but the outside of my heels are still being torn to shreds.  The Merrill Mid Moab’s were the right call to start with, but I am glad my Ultra Lone Peak 3.0, that my wife shopped are waiting for me at the Outfitters in Hot Springs. Not to complain but all of our hands, especially the thumbs are cracked and split.  Don’t know how or why, just know it even hurts to text on the phone!  Oh well, hoping things get a chance to heal in Hot Springs.","Roaring Forks Shelter

Quick camp breakdown and on the trail downhill for a 2 mile Nero into Hot Springs, NC.  I love the “wild” but there is something about rounding a corner and seeing a town unfold in the valley below.  Emerging from the Woods, we turned left to the Laughing Heart Hostel to drop our packs and head to the Smokey Mtn Diner, one of the best known eats on the trail.  It lived up to expectations and was totally filled.  Didn’t matter, just about every table was Thru Hikers such as Tank, and Tag Along, Suga, CC, and then Sassy. Behind us came Tang (Paulie), Amber, Jinx and SameZ. We all ended up at the same table and caught up on everyone’s different experiences at Max Patch. Plus, we found out that the fire we saw from the Smokies three days ago and the burned out area on Walnut Mtn and the small grass Bald were one in the same.  It was a controlled burn that a few hikers were allowed through while being watched by a helicopter from the air.  Others were rerouted to skip the section. We did see a sign for “AT North” come from our right as we headed straight up a hill.  We all still questioned how they were so good at controlling a burn versus burning down the whole forest.  Breakfast was awesome and I even had Fried Bologna (from my youth). Then down the street to Bluff Mtn Outfitters for my Box from home that contain my much needed Trail Runners.  The boots served me well but I am looking forward to the lighter low riders and Gators to match my sleeves (still need Trail Style!).  Back to the hostel to check in for real and chores (Shower, pack cleaning, recharging electronics, get on the list for washing clothes, and creating a Grocery List). I took a chance and took my belt off the pack to see if I could get a new zipper put on the pocket that hasn’t been usable (without a lot of worry). Instead, Wayne and Justin at Bluff Mtn Outfitters, did me even better.  They switched me from a large to a medium new belt with working zippered pockets that was missing some buckles that they swapped from my large belt at no charge!  They said they would call Chris at ULA and he would stand behind his product and make it right with Bluff Mtn Outfitters.  Both Companies are great in my mind!  Dollar General was next and not needing much I still spent 35 times $1!  Hiker hunger is setting in a little plus I needed another small tube of toothpaste and cough drops to pay back Recon as well as some DayQuil to help me over this cold.  All in all a successful Resupply for 5 Days.  Still carried to much food through the Smokies by about 4 Days but probably down to about one day extra.  Oh, was able to weight myself and down 15 lbs.  Probably need to put back on 5. I tried at the Spring Creek Tavern for dinner!  Still got a great salad. Love the Greens in town now.  Back to the hostel to prepare for tomorrow morning Breakfast on the way out of town.

Didn’t take long and we were far from the sounds of civilization.  The morning was awesome although clouded in mist. Occasionally the Sun made a small attempt to burn off the fog but seem to tire and give up easily.  I felt great with the new Trail Runners and the Pack carried better on my hips and less pull on the shoulders with the medium belt.  Especially, since there is a six day resupply to get to Erwin Tn.  By 11:00, I felt stronger hiking than I have for awhile.  Climbing a hill, I saw a wall with water flowing over it.  Then you crest the wall and see that it is holding back water that is creating a beautiful pond with benches around it!  Shame it wasn’t lunch time, just Payday candy bar time!The scenery then changed to a meadow that use to grow Tobacco, but is now being use to roost grouse and turkey. The Cinnabon must have worn off by 12:15 because I crashed hard.  Even stopping for lunch only gave a temporary boost.  The rain started falling harder, the temperature was dropping and the wind, chilled to the bone.  I couldn’t get the pack adjusted comfortably again, and the fanny pack clip was digging into my side.  I realized that I “Clomped” in the boots, but the Trail Runners forced me to use my lower calf and foot muscles working the toes more.  Much more comfortable and no blister aggravation, but different muscles being used caused a different soreness and fatigue.  By 2:00 I reached the Shelter, the First mileage target.  It was now winding, cold and big snow flakes falling although they were flurries and not sticking. I refilled water, talked to Tank and Tag as everyone was deciding whether to stop or push on.  Even though my body wasn’t into it, I did want to push on to lower elevation for a warmer night and less wind chill hopefully. When Recon caught us, he definitely was going on further.  So he set the lead.  I was last out of the shelter because of filtering and refilling water source, mainly to stay current on Day Quil for the head cold.  It must have worked because my hiking pace was much improved. Uphills still a little slow, but I was bounding from side to side on the downhill.   Passed Tank and Tag, and a Section Hiker from the Hostel named Sheffy.  I think some ThruHikers must get an attitude with Section Hikers.  I don’t though.  I have over 250 miles on my legs and Sheffy said it takes about 6 days to get his and usually the sections only take 10 days.  He has well over 1200 miles complete so my hats off to him.  I’m just lucky to be experiencing a Thru, but I would Section if not!  I finally got up to Recon at a pour water site and checked Guthooks for our location in comparison to water sources.  We were just .8 away so off we went.  Recon seemed to need time to himself and I didn’t want to be a nuisance, so I tried to just allow space.  Everyone circled up at the watering hole and prepared to carry what was needed to dry camp where ever we found a spot.  Down the trail off to the left, Recon spotted an old road and investigated to see if it had good camp spots.  I stayed above on the trail waiting for Tank and Tag a Long.  We all then dropped to the gravel road and started walking along it Recon had gone one direction and was now going the other.  We ended meeting back up with the trail at Allen Gap, up from a road below. Sheffy was already set up in the valley below.  Tank and Tag found a spot and I finally had trees to hang the hammock from.  I went back up to locate Recon and he had a much quieter spot away from the rid and much more secluded.  I felt bad, because I liked the spot but no trees were spaced correctly for hanging.  So I left him to himself and went back down with the others.  While setting my Tarp in porch mode to cook under, because of rain/sleet, Sassy emerged from the woods onto the road and was able to set up right next to me.  She said, she would move if cramping my space but actually it was enjoyable to talk back and forth while cooking dinner sitting in the Hammocks.  The tent dwellers all but disappear!  I took the Tarp out of porch mode and locked it down tight to the ground, hoping this it the last night of cold and possible snow.","Laughing Heart Hostel

I couldn’t even unbuckle the door snaps so I had to take the hammock down first.  However, the Sun was rising and that always helps the spirit.  Recon went ahead because he need water and Sassy shortly there after.  I followed Sheffy leaving Tank and Tag to bring up the rear.   I meant Sass at a road crossing rubbing her foot to try and ease the pain of Morton’s Neuroma.  I had my breakfast of a Honey Bunn there.  Mmmmm. Then back to the climb and grind. Yet, as we gained altitude and viewed our surroundings and nearby Mountains covered in deeper ice/snow, we knew we made the correct choice to camp lower in the Gap, last night. As we walked through the Trees and Rhododendrons, the wind would blow and the ice pellets would fall on us, followed by a mist of fine snow.  At first it was cool but by early afternoon it did get a little annoying. Like an accordion we all came together at the first shelter, for water resupply and a quick snack.     I used the Privy (made it this time) and took off my Waist Pack.  My glasses must have fallen out, because Tag found them and asked if they were mine.  He then joked about me not “flushing” which cracked everyone up.  So grateful, he did that!  I then helped Sassy tape a tear drop pad directly to her foot (she had been sticking it to the insole) to try and ease our pain.  She commented that I was good at taping that. Past experience helped but I was not practicing anything because I am not Licensed anymore!  Just one Hiker helping another.  Although she was still in pain in camp later, she did say that helped it more than anything had prior.  I think it was the Prayers.  An hour and a half later, I stopped for Lunch so I wouldn’t bottom out like yesterday.  Then a long climb started.  Part way up, I took my eyes off the Trail to look over at the next snow covered mountain over and misstepped, caught a pole, stumbled and fell onto my side and back part way down from the trail. 1st fall since Springer so I guess I can’t complain.  Didn’t make 300 miles without falling though!  Luckily nothing close to being hurt.  But I am sure they are playing a blooper reel in Heaven, and having a good laugh.  I am great full it was there because we then started a strenuous climb of an exposed ridge.  It had a Bad Weather Trail designated, so we wondered what all the fuss was about.  I had never seen this in anyone’s vlog and am surprise.  It was a beautiful view that almost matched Mt Cammerrer.  It was called Firescald Knob and looking to the West, someone said you could see Greenville Tn. below.  It was also cool to see snow on some of the mountains around our summit.  There was a plaque for the Trail Builder and he did one heck of a job.  Technical I. Some parts, rocks that formed perfect steps in others. I actually enjoyed the boulder Scramble playground on a Sunday early afternoon.  Then back to the normal trail and being pelted by snow pellets.  Caught Recon on the side of the Trail and noticed the 300 was spelled out with Sticks!  Picture and Payday Candy-bar time!  Fist bumps all around for 300 miles.  Then we headed on hoping to get 15 miles in today.  But a little ways up the Trail, Recon let both myself and Sassy pass. When I hit the Shelter I stopped and checked Guthooks to see what lies ahead - a big climb, no water, and scarce camping at higher elevations.  Recon said he was shot for the day and this was it.  Sassy and I agreed and started setting up camp. Tank and Tag showed up a little later and didn’t even hesitated to drop pack and pull out tents.  Great ending to a Sunday with an early dinner and then time to chill in the warm hammock!","Allen Gap

Oh, Recon did give me a hammock shake wake up call and left my food bag that he retrieved from the bear cables!  He has been having hip and quad issues for a couple of days, but said that heat packs helped last night.  Sassy’s foot did better with the pad to the foot directly but still can’t shake it.  I still have a cough, but head cold isn’t as bad it seems.  Just hate this cold wet snow in April!  We headed out and immediately Recon mentioned 18 miles to Sams Gap and a Hostel to dry out and warm up.  Worked out to be two miles beyond our Shelter Destinations.  He didn’t have to ask twice, we were all in!  I skipped Breakfast which was a mistake because we started with a climb.  Luckily Sass was stopped and rubbing her feet so it gave me a chance to eat my Pop Tarts. That did the trick and we were off climbing Big Butt Mtn.  Of course lots of comments start such as “I like big butt and I cannot lie”. It gets worse so let’s just say we took the Big Butt slow and steady and we’re happy to put it behind us!  I missed Sheltons Gravesite because of snow and focus.  These were two Brothers that fought in the Civil War.  One for the North and One for the South.  I think the book and movie Cold Mtn are loosely based on it, but not sure.  At 11:00 we were letting an uphill hiker pass. He asked if we were Thru Hiking and we responded in the affirmative.  He turned his back and asked if we wanted real on trail magic.  Hanging there was a bunch of bananas.  We were in heaven!  His name was Yonder and he hiked the trail in 07’. We must have passed his inspection because he then offered us Apple Fritters and a can of Coke. Now we really were in heaven!  When saying goodbye he stated to leave the peels and cans in the bag attached to his car at the Gap!  What a boost an encounter like that can cause!  Thanks Yonder 07’!  We did pass one stream that was peaceful and climbed to where is started as a Waterfall.  That was a beautiful sight.  But just beyond it were two man made stepping ladders across a mud section.  I wasn’t going to use either one, but at the last minute decided to walk on the fist section.  When i went to push off the last one by board, my foot slipped and I crashed to the ground.  The Sawyer Filter (that I Store in my pants to keep from freezing smashed into my left knee and my forehead bounced on the ground and a rock or two.  Two falls in two consecutive days!  This one rattled me though.  No hopping up quick.  I laid there a few minutes to make sure nothing was to mangled. Actually, I was wearing my buff as a headband / ear muffs and it actually cushioned it and saved a cut.  Instead, it was just road burn!  Later I found that my shin was also torn up and bloodied.  Sassy joked that I felt left out with Recon and her both gimping around.  I would have rather not bashed my head though!  Oh well, we had to get to Sams Gap.  Recon trailed us all day, which is not like him, so I know he was hurting.  Finally, spent after passing the Shelter we would have stopped at, we came to a monument. It read,    “Moye Rest ...It is our prayer that the Moye Tract along the trail will be a place of inner peace and gentle rest “.

I don’t ever like to backtrack southbound but I am glad we did.  Quiet Paul AT 07’, asked us how many eggs.  He laughed at me when I said one!  He said that had never happened before.  But he scrambled them all together, out in three plates, added hash brown potatoes and gave us each a fork.  Those were killer hash-browns, better than any restaurant!  Finished with a cookie and said our goodbyes to Quiet Paul and we were off at 8:35.  Big climb that totaled six miles for the morning, but culminated in Big Bald Mountain.  Another grassy bald that had a great 360 View.  Although, the south side has housing construction, and what looks like a Ski Resort.  It was hard to tell.  Ate lunch just down out of the wind of the bald and had as great of a view as Amicalola Falls Dinner view!  Touched base quickly with Tank and Tag, as they arrived and then we were off to Little Bald where we could look back at where we had just been.  A beautiful hike all around.  Then back Into the Woods to get to Spivey Gap. When Sass hit the top of one big climb she hollered.  Recon got there and he hooted.  I was last so I didn’t do anything.  But a few steps further I saw Recon on the ground.  It looked a little odd but I assumed he was stretching his quad or hip again.  I asked if he was ok and he said he was just getting a Jolly Rancher.  I saw one in his hand so I just told him, “Ok big guy, see you up the Trail.   About 1/2 mile after that, Sassy stopped on a flatter part of the downhill to rub out her foot.  Recon came up a few minutes later and asked Sassy if she wanted to hear a funny story.  She said, “Sure”.  So Recon says, “ Remember back at the top of the trail were you gave a Holler and I gave a hoot? Well I took a few steps more and tried to get a Jolly Rancher.  There was an outcropping and view to my left that caught my attention, while my pole got jammed, and my foot slipped.  I smashed to the ground, glasses flying, and just took a second to gather myself.  Still had the Jilly Rancher in my hand though.  Her comes G and he asked if I was doing ok.  I jokingly said, Just getting a Jolly Rancher.  He say’s ok big guy, see you up the Trail and hiked on!”  I felt so bad, I just wanted to crawl under a Log. Knowing he was ok, Sassy just laughed.  Luckily Recon also has a sense of humor, at least I hope so!  I felt bad for not recognizing the situation for what it was, but we all shared his Jolly Ranchers later on!  Actually, the hiking  wasn’t to bad today.  I did take Vitamin I for the aches from the fall yesterday and still battling a cough.  I also am having strange Rt hip pain but I think it’s radiated from a different spot that the pack belt may be rubbing.  It seems to improve if I loosen and adjust the hip belt.  Other than that, we just hike the miles.  We hit Spivey Gap early, so we started another 5 Miles to get to No Business Knob Shelter.  However, we had No Business attempting that.  Plus the water source is .2 this side of the shelter.  We rounded a bend and found a wonderful stream water source to filter.  Recon did what he does, and scoped down in the valley a little, and found the perfect spot for the night.  He even traded me Chicken Soup for Mash Potatoes!  Great finish to a great day, leaving us just under 10 miles for Erwin Tn.  I think we are all ready to be finished with North Carolina, but what a difference a day makes!","Sam’s Gap

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586413,"Still a bit chilly this morning, probably due to moisture from the stream close by.  The knowledge of a Nero got us up early, shortly after 6am instead of closer to 7 or later.  On the trail by 8 to head downhill to town.  Yet, it is never down hill all the way. Climbed up to No Business Knob Shelter and of course No Business was allowed!  Just continued to fuel the body on a regular schedule.  After that, we caught glimpses of Erwin.  One doesn’t know the heights of the mountains until the perspective of a town far below, gives some perspective.  As you descend and the town draws closer and closer, we start to realize how high up we have been hiking.  It was just under 10 miles to the Nollichucky River, but a wonderful hike that took all morning.  Everyone is feeling better today than two days ago!  Recons Hip/Thigh seemed to be history and he once again was showing his hiking prowess.  Sass’s foot is improving daily and longer miles between breaks.  We are adding a pad to the teardrop to see if we can completely get pressure off the nerve.  Great views coming into Erwin but nice when we hit bottom and saw the bridge, railroad tracks, an the Hostel to the left.  Checked in and set up the hammock under the roof!  Need set up for $15 bucks. Water pressure is a problem, so Laundry is out! (We did some at Natures Inn so we are set). Shower was a trickle but warm water and we made it work!  Then it was electronics recharge time, dry items in the Sun, and create a Grocery List.  Because Sassy has so much in her resupply, I cut down on what I have to buy.  Still Shuttling to Walmart for a few dinner items (Chicken Soup for sure), Pop Tarts, and a fuel can to back up the one I am currently using.  Mexican dinner was good but the $1 off Marguerite was awesome!  Walmart was Walmart, doesn’t matter where it is, it’s easy to figure out! Although, this one did have more hiker quantity packaging.  We’ll be a heavy climb in the morning.  All in all relaxing on this Nero.","Stealth Camp Mike 334

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586711,"Uncle Johnny’s has a lot going for it. Great location, good shuttle to Mexican Food with a great Marguerite  (although Recon and Sass probably wont eat it again on the trail), Walmart, and I slept so well in the Hammock Bay - a covered structure with wood studs to hang hammocks from.  It was awesome to not have a tarp but not be forced to the ground or into a bunkhouse.  The problem with the hostel is no water pressure for shower or laundry and the dryer was broken so at least it was half price.  We ended up skipping it and dancing around to get somewhat clean.  It made for a quick morning take down and we were on the trail earlier than normal.  The climb out was the reverse of yesterday.  Glimpses showed the town getting smaller and smaller as we gained more and more elevation.  I felt great hiking all morning.  Either I am getting stronger or Ruthie’s last Organic Hershey Energy Coffee Shot really works well!  We finished climbing and dropped into Indian Grave Gap were there was Trail Magic.  A cold ice tea, brownie, cutie orange, water refill, trash deposit and lawn chair provided by Brother Tom. During introductions and my mention of Dayton Ohio, he stated that he is a Graduate of University of Dayton!  Small world!  It was just after noon, so we took advantage of the chairs and had lunch.  Brother Tom got a kick out of my crunchy peanut butter-frito-dried banana wrap!  He  mentioned that there may be more Trail Magic at Beauty Knob provided by the Pizza Man.  So we were off to climb to the spot.  Close Call was hanging with us and so was Repete.  This is his second Thru after he completed one in 2015.  He says that he may even try to become Threepete!  I think he can, he blew past us on the way to the top of the Bald!  Beauty Spot was just like its name said, it’s beauty only blemished by my presence on its top.  Robert was there with pizza, chips, and iced drinks in a cooler.  His dog was enjoying the time up there as well.  There is a parking lot close by, by even from there was a challenge because if the dogs age.  It has had eye surgery at UT in Knoxville even.  Great pair provided great magic on a beautiful Knob.  You could see Erwin below, the Cinch Mountains in the distance and way off were the Cumberland Mountains that run the Kentucky, Tennessee Border. It was so nice to lean back on the ground and soak up the Sunshine.  Perfect temperature in the low seventies!  Hiking doesn’t get any better.  Except that we had Unaka Mtn staring down on us!  So off we went to tackle it.  In Georgia, this would have been as formidable as any that we hiked; but once again we seemed to be better prepared for it now!  That or the two Mtn Dews really kicked in for me!  Recon is back into his form and I had Sass take off the outer sock and just go with a liner that seemed to reduce her foot pain; because they both put distance on me to the top!  I stopped once for a standing breather and once for a perfect log that called my name.  The trail was laid out well with switchbacks and at one point I felt a gentle breeze push me up the trail from behind.  There were false summits that usually are aggravating but in this case, they provided an opportunity to recover and keep going.  At one false summit, I caught Recon and Sass because they had stopped to look at an actual Live Christmas Tree that is decorated and occasionally hikers leave presents underneath. It is a memorial to a 22 Year Old Man that lost his life too soon. Very interesting what you see on the trail!  Sass took off again, saying she wanted to hoot and holler when she hit the top!  The only problem was that the Top wasn’t a normal Rocky Summit. Instead, it was a beautiful pine tree enchanted Forrest.  Pine needles carpeted the trail floor. It was nice a cool, shaded from the sun!  Only at the very top was there Sunlight due to blown down trees.  At the very instant, I had a fresh cool breeze blow on my face!  I swear God was fanning me himself (except I am not that important). Then back down the other side to more of the cool enchanted forest.  Finally, we dropped in attitude enough and the ups and downs were more gentle that the shelter suddenly appeared and our hiking day was done at 5:15. Typical camp set up, gather/filter water, cook dinner, hang food bag(s), and in bed by Hiker midnight (9pm). Tomorrow, we are trying to get to the highest shelter (Roan Mtn Shelter) on the Trail, while the weather is still good.  Going to be about 19 miles total.  Tom is leaving at 6:00 but he really is hoping to find Wild Turkeys. I am going to try and leave between 7 and 8.  There is talk of Winter Returning Sunday or Monday, so we want to be smart. However, I am also trying to Keep the Faith.  Tom was sent and article about bear problems on the AT at the Southern End of the Smokies.  Trapping people in tents and stealing unattended packs!  Makes me appreciate when I came through there, I was in a hail/sleet storm and never saw any bears!","Uncle Johnny’s Hostel Erwin, Tn.

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586719,"Got an early start, prior to 8am.  Not as early as Recon! He headed out at 6 to track Turkeys like he does at home.  The morning was awesome! Great weather, great trail and great hiking.  We did ten miles by lunch at noon. We book it to Hughes Gap at the same rate of just under three miles an hour.  I felt awesome, just like hiking at home       I did develop my first blister in my Altra 3.0, right on the inner tip of my big toe on the left foot.  KT tape with some Luekotape and it was good to go!  Pounding the miles until we hit the base of Roan Mountain.  Our goal was Roan High Knob Shelter, the highest Shelter on the AT at 6249 ft.  The idea was to get past it and hike to lower elevation if more snow moves back in Sunday or Monday.  This is the highest we will being until we hit the White Mtn’s way up North.  But the climb up Roan was brutal.  I understand the Joke about Switchbacks having Switchbacks.  Although, I am grateful for the switchbacks.  Without them, the straight up would have been almost impossible.  If it hadn’t been at the end of the day and low in energy, the top would have been more enjoyable.  There was an old hotel site, the Cloudland Hotel and a Chimney is still standing in the middle of the pines.  The Shelter sites in an enchanted forest much like Unaka yesterday.  There were still frozen icicles on some of the rock outcroppings that don’t see much sun. However, it was windy and cool on hot sweaty skin.  After visiting the water source to fill the entire supply used up during the climb, it was decided to drop down and hike another 1.5 to Carver Gap and find a place to spend the night there.  Biggest selling point is a Privy close by.  Something that Tennessee doesn’t really believe in for some reason. All in all, the most miles have done in a day, since starting, so I am pleased.  Many that started today, stopped at Ash Gap, 3.3 Miles back or finished at the Shelter itself.  Tomorrow, it looks like we hit a number of balls again, which is always enjoyable.","Cherry Gap Shelter

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586822,"Last night, chatted with a lady while filtering water at Roan High Knob Shelter.       She is Section hiking from I40 to Damascus. Tough Section!  Crossed paths with her today and LadyBug said that it was windy, cold, misty/damp, and very crowded there last night. We thought that was the case because We listened to the wind race high overhead all night. Yet, we slept great and had a Privy to use in the morning.  A luxury item for sure, and awesome when there is no TP but I had my own! The day started with a climb up and over three balds: Riund Top, Jane and Grassy Knob.  Wish I could tell you about beautiful views but all we saw was cloud mist and two feet of trail in front of us as we battle wind that threatened to knock us off our feet.  Leaning into it helped until it caught the pack and tried to spin you around.  Definitely a challenging climb.  After we created the top and started down the back side, the Wind slowed, the sun came out and the mist was gone.    Wonderful hiking all the way to were the path leads to Overmountain Shelter, a Barn that has history back to the Revolutionary War.  I would have loved to stay there but it wasn’t in the cards. Then a climb up to Little Hump Mountain starts.  I think it’s really more beautiful on the way up than at the top. A lot less windy as well! Then you can see Big Hump Mountain from there.  A long trail with Ant people climbing and descending.  To get to it though, you take a huge right turn that had everyone check
Guthooks to make sure we all were still on the AT. Then it loops way back around to the left, and below Little Hump back to the straight trail visible from above.  I am sure there are erosion problems and the are trying to save the Bald; but talk about a ton of added steps and a round about way to get there!  It didn’t really matter, the haul up Hump Mountain was a long lengthy process, once again accompanied by high winds.  Leaning into them, straining to stay on trail.  Fighting to not get blown over!  Many many false summits.  When I did hit the top, once again the views were better on the climb up.  Wanted to have lunch there but way to windy for that, so downed a bar and continued on.  Finally, a good decent down from the summit, we avoided the wind and leaned against a rock for a late lunch.  It was there that AWOL listed Bob’s Dairyland with Burgers big enough to fill an AT Hikers Stomach.  This became a goal for a late Saturday Afternoon treat!  So down the mountain we went.  There was some beautiful Meadows and possible Camp sites if it were later in the day and more for tenting.  One of
the most beautiful was Doll Flats.  We also took selfies at the Leaving NC (for the last time) Sign. North Carolina didn’t treat us the greatest weather wise!  Then came the king downhill to US19E.  We finally did loop around again to meet up with the road.  Crossed over when we figured out Roan and Bobs was to the West.  Stuck out Thumbs and the third car pulled over!  (Not
that God doesn’t have more important things to do; but I did pray for this!). Crusty Goat AT 15’ picked us up!  He apologized for the seat being ripped and explained they were on there way home from Linville Gorge and a Bear had gotten into the car! Unbelievable!  It was so strange to be in a car going that speed!  He pulled right to the front door and gave us two Cutie Oranges when we got our packs out!  I had the BBQ Pork  sandwich combo followed by soft serve ice cream for deserts.  It was a delicious treat and everything imagined on the trail.  It made it a real Saturday!  Then a walk across the street and thumbs out to catch a ride back to the trail.  Third car was Marci, a local that has
Property backing up to Doll Flats.  She actually went out of
Her way to take us because after we hopped out, she went back in the direction of town!  We hiked awhile to get away from the Road, find water and then scope out a place to hang.  Ate Cuties for desert and then to bed.  The wind is picking up again and probably blowing in rain for Sunday morning and sleet/snow into Monday!","Carvers Gap

Being Sunday morning, I really  wish I was close to a church. Low and behold, I crossed a road and to the right was a Baptist Church. Strange thing was that it had no sign as to when the worship services were!  Very Strange. It was 8:40 and not a soul in sight so I kept hiking although somewhat conflicted.  I was able to listen to “God is Able” while spending a few minutes at Jones Falls, a beautiful flowing waterfall.  Then a couple miles later, I hit the 400 mile mark and let out a yelp!  It’s hard to believe that I have gone 400 miles in one month.  Although today is Sunday and not a Thursday, it’s the 15th of the month.  After celebrating, I walked through a meadow, along a stream and then started uphill to another waterfall.  However, the rain was really falling and I couldn’t spend anytime enjoying it.  Another Climb and a saw a sign for Mountaineer Shelter.  A little early for lunch but couldn’t pass up the chance to get out of the rain. Was second person there, so I pulled out lunch.  The 1st person booked when another hiker and a dog showed up.  Then a flip flopper.  Sass showed up and ate as well.  We all had intentions of heading out, but thunder and hard rain had other plans for us.  So everyone started grabby spots as more and more hikers showed up.  I have the pad blown up, clothes drying, and am kicked back in the quilt trying to relax.  I guess if I didn’t  go to church than I am not going to hike this Sunday.  At one point we got Shelter crazy and started to pack back up; but a sudden cloud burst had us right back in the Shelter to stay!

Early on, it was nice hiking in snow when not to cold.  However, the temp continued to drop throughout the day and the wet seemed to infiltrate shoes, pack and headwear.  I did have a wonderful view from an actual park bench on the trail, looking south.  I hope the picture turns out; it would be a great winter scene behind the couch.  Other than that, the low hanging Rhododendrons continue to dump snow on my head, in my face and down my back.  The trail was more Ohio like, so I was making good time.  Ten miles in a little over four hours, got me to a lunch time Shelter.  It was there that Easy peasy and Irish said they had just got a Cabin at Black Bear and he said there were still bunks available but going fast.  He let me use his phone because he had just called and the number was the most recent.  I reserved two bunks and left word with Snow Angel (Netherland Hiker from previous Shelter) to tell Sass a bunk was there unless she told me to cancel.  Then the March was on to the Hostel with only six miles to go. A trail came from the right and I could tell that on a good day there is a view, however, to my surprise there was a Coyote that emerged!  He hung his head low and turned back as I passed and then came back out again.  He was snow covered, chilled and lethargic. It actually was sad to see one of Gods Creatures in this shape.  Not proud and strong but probably close to death.  I could do nothing and felt helpless.  When the trail and a stream merged into one, my struggled paled in comparison to the coyote, so I tried to keep my shoes dry; but ultimately failed.  Feet soaked, both pairs of socks wet, and temp still dropping, it was wonderful to hit Dennis Cove Road and hang a left to get to Black Bear Resort.  Checked in, Showered, did all my clothes including gloves, hats, sleep ware, and just about everything that was damp; not so much as to clean, but more for the dryer.  Pizza, chips, Pops, and Snickers Ice Cream went on the tab.  When I checked out, I got a frosted Honey Bun for breakfast.  The tab runs up quickly at these places. Suddenly $20 more is gone on top of the bunk rate!  Can’t afford it, but can’t afford a night out cold and wet.  April 16th and we are still talking snow!  But it is the hike the Lord is giving me.  I past Tank and Tag Along today, Slack Packing Southbound back to 19E Hostel.  Paul, Amber, and Jinx hiked Southbound back to here for a Second night, so spending time with them was great! They saw Recon hiking today, so he is ok and about 18 miles ahead of us.  Everyone is finding ways to battle the strange weather and still hike.  Sass is meeting friends tomorrow, so I will be heading on to Damascus Solo.  Black Bear is a nice set up, just doesn’t have cell service or WiFi. The strange thing is that they have an old land line phone that they let you call and use for five minutes.  I did get to let my Wife know that I was warm, safe, and in doors for the night.  Much better off than the poor Coyote. Tomorrow is suppose to clear and be back into the fifties, which is good.  Due to Bear issues at Watauga Lake, the hike will be a minimum of 18 Miles, God willing.  Yet, I have no doubt that God is watching over me, a healthy Coyote could have torn all of us to shreds!","Mountaineer Shelter

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587228,"The day started with a beautiful Sunrise that made me grateful to be alive for another day on the trail.  I thanked the Lord and wondered why I really never did this prior to the trail, other than unique special days.  But everyday the Lord has made and we should rejoice.  It’s just a hard habit to get into.  Left around 7:45 and soon hiked with Harper and Butter Knife that I couldn’t hang with the night before, that dropped me at my perfect camp spot.  Oh, in the middle of the night I had lights below and stars above, just beautiful.  I pulled away from them and awhile later, I heard a horrible rustling in the Woods.  A Crow went flying by overhead, away from the commotion.  I thought “Bear” and instantly slowed and searched as I hiked along.  Then I found an Oldtimer off the trail, dusting himself off after a  fall.  I used my Trekking pole to help him back onto the trail, checked his forehead for him and then talked him a little further up the trail to sit on a log.  It seemed his worse injury was a cut finger that was starting to clot.  I asked if he needed bandages or duck tape and he said he had both.  He thanked me for stopping but I could tell he was now embarrassed, so I headed on.  I spent time wondering if I did enough but also didn’t want to overstep.  People are hard to figure when it comes to helping out.  Only an hour later, I hit a Shelter where Easy Peasy was taking a break and  waiting for Irish Paul.  We realized that they were the last two hikers to pass my camp and agreed that it was a great location. Met a SOBO with a Dog so that was kind of cool but sad.  Easy started with his dog but had to take it home.  He let the SOBO know that he left a ton of food and expensive bars (from the TV Show Shark Tank) at Black Bear if the SOBO wanted them.  I left Easy and Irish to there morning coffee but would end up leap frogging each other all day.  The trail was easier than it has been and much more like Taylorsville Metro Park, that I trained on Tuesday.  Yet, the uphills and the total miles still wore me down and dropped my miles per hour closer to 2 than 3.  At lunch time I passed through pastures  still in use and gated with nifty locks to open and close.  One Barn had the AT symbol on it so that was cool.  There was a bench near the top of the first pasture, but I chose a Rock to sit and eat on.  Pretty soon a
Guy with a
Camera showed up.  He works for the National Parks and we talked the Roan Mtns, Smokies and just how great the Trail is. He pointed out were Damascus is and it was about 15 miles Due East.   Of course we head Northwest, climb a Ridge up and Down looping an arc around to the North for 12 Miles before hiking 10 more to drop into town!  He left shortly before I did, but as
I was leaving, he walked back and asked if he could take some picks as I hiked away.  I said “Sure!” but they probably won’t be pretty.  After snapping some, he gave me his Facebook page so I could see them.  I haven’t had signal yet, so I am hoping to view them in a day or so.  The rest of the afternoon was just miles on miles, with two water stops because the temps were in the low 70’s.  At 4:30, I checked Guthooks to see how far the Shelter was, water location and possible camping beyond.  I had 1.4 miles to go and decided that would be it for the day.  I was wore out and surprised that I wasn’t already at the Shelter.  When i finally arrived there was one Hiker set up in the shelter, a tent and hammock a little further and I was the 3rd one there.  While setting up Easy Peasy and Irish showed up, and others followed.  It was .2 miles down to the Spring and the straight back up.  That was hard, but didn’t have any other choice. Ate dinner at the table in front of the shelter and met Maverick, the one stays inside.  He started February 22 and wondered where all these people suddenly came from!   We discussed hiking your own hike and doing it the way and rate that you desire.  He is retired Military and in shape so he could hike 30 if he pushed, he just doesn’t see the point.  Although he didn’t expect so many people passing by this early.  In the chat I must have said something that sparked him, because he confirmed that I was a Christian and so was he.  I only mention it because it was so casual and I liked that.  It was simple and like the norm that it should be.  I just needed to note it in the Journal because it may have significance to my journey.  Finally, I was off to my hammock and checking miles for the day, when I realized I had done my first 20 mile day! 20.9 to be exact!  Small thing but cool.  That leaves me with just under ten to get into Damascus tomorrow, which was what I was hoping for.","Past Vandeventer Shelter Mile 439

Arrived at the same time as Easy Pete and Irish Paul.  Took a selfie for the Day but also grabbed one with the three of us.  Hiking close to the same pace as them since sharing Mountaineer Shelter in the Storm.  Pete laughed because he had just received a message from Sass telling her about hiking with me and she had just replied to tell me hi!  We would all play leap frog down to the entrance to Damascus for the famous picture with the Arch Sign.  We spent some time in the Visitors center as we all tried to find housing for tonight.  They ended up in a private double bed room and I finally got a hold of Amber and Paul to set up my spot in a Cabin they have been in for two days.  The three of us had time to kill so we went looking for a restaurant, hoping for salads and vegetables.  No luck. We walked the whole town and past a pizza joint that doesn’t serve beer yet.  A diner that doesn’t open till Saturday.  Past “Cowboys” which was the most famous place but was closed due to illegal activities. Finally, thought we would have to settle for Subways but found a wonderful coffee and food cafe called “Mojos” next door.  Ordered a White Mocha as it was low forties and misty cloudy all day as well as ice tea and the Creeper Philly Sandwich. All of it was awesome.  While there, Paul came in and informed me that the “cabin” was four buildings back and to come on in when finished. He agreed the Creeper was a great sandwich.  Plus, potato chips are about the most perfect side dish!  I said my good byes and headed to find my place for the night.   It was strange walking into the place, but immediately recognized just about everyone there.  Suddenly Recon came around the corner and fisted me!  So great to see him, hear about the Tent Ladies that crowded him out way back when we last camped together, and to catch up making sure families are all well.  It was then Laundry time followed by Grocery Resupply. On the way to Food Town (1 Mile away but seemed a lot further) I stopped at Mt Rogers Outfitters for a smaller pair of Convertible pants.  No luck.  Got most of the resupply I needed but no Spam so I am short on Lunches.  Went by Dollar General but their supply truck doesn’t come in till tomorrow.  It seems like we are slightly ahead of the expected bubble but behind the early February starters. I will probably pack out Subways to make up for one lunch. When I got back to the cabin, I went to a different outfitter and found pants but didn’t like the brand or the price.  I did get a good quality shirt for $19.99 that fits looser than the current one.  I will save the current one for Summer when I will want shorter tighter sleeves and this new shirt can become a cooler sleep shirt.  My clothes were dry so I changed back into them and put my “town pants” into the washer / drier to get clean while it didn’t cost anything and was right here. I then packaged up my food.  Made some trades with Amber  to get rid of Candy bars but get trail mix that she swears I need to get my weight back up.  She is probably right but I hate the first day after a town stop.  The pack is over capacity and isn’t fun to carry.  Dinner was the best part of the entire day.  One hiker works as a Chef when off trail and it was an awesome dinner of salad Balsamic Dressing, Asparagus with broccoli, mashed potatoes and chicken in a carrot broth. My mouth waters just thinking of it afterwards. I had to make a quick trip to get to the gas station for a Mtn. Dew and water bottle. I needed the bottle to cut into a scoop to replace my 1st one that was splitting down the length.  Then came three scoops of different flavor ice cream to top off the night, while watching Hockey. Although, Damascus is iconic to walk through and experience, it seems to be more of a bike town than a “hiker” town.  Then again, we are ahead of a bubble it seems and 28 days before the famous trail days, so it may just be timing.  Then again, timing was everything yesterday when I met the photographer for the Park System.  Saw his Facebook post and was able to reshare it.  Very cool experiences the last couple of days to get 3 states finished. However, the fourth, Va. is the longest and we’ll take the month of May to get through.","Abingdon Gap Shelter

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587886,"Damascus to Stealth Camp Strange sleeping in a house!  Difficult to get to sleep, but slept well.  Woke about 5:45 to the sound of Recon starting his day.  Amazing that I could tell it was him.  Dozed until 6:15 and decided I should take advantage of ground coffee and went in to Join Recon.  He joked about start of day coinciding with current age starting from oldest to youngest.  It made since, Relentless was preparing to hike early and Repeat wasn’t to far behind. Gypsy (Canada) was up next and everyone else followed.  Breakfast of Biscuits and Gravy, Bananas, cinnamon buns and even a glass of Orange Juice.  Helped fold Blankets and return the cabin to pre hiker condition, or at least make it an easy clean and turn around.  Still headed out at 8:15 hoping to get a Sub to carry out of town for the first Trail lunch. Wasn’t meant to be, the Subway opened at 9:00.  So I was on my way, sans sandwich. It was neat to be on the Creeper Trail.  Chatted with Stone Hinge who I hadn’t see since Black Bear.  I soon turned and pulled away from the Creeper.  I would find out that the AT parallels the Creeper except much higher up and not nearly as straight.  The miles rolled by as I thought of getting to talk to Joanie on the phone last night.  Just to laugh together and hear each other’s voice and share laughter like we do on a daily basis back home, is so amazing and bonding.  But then painful because it makes me miss her that much more.  Then I debated if that pain was greater than not getting phone service and not communicating at all.  Honestly, both suck but it is now part of what the trail provides and I just need to keep the faith and know that it will all work out along the way.  It still sucks!  So then I turned on the Pod Cast “Mighty Blue on the AT” I started listening to a
Program here or there a few days before Damascus.  I didn’t think I would listen to much music or what few Pod Cast I had, but found out the I enjoy it and may check into Audio Books, maybe even listen to the Bible if able.  In two of the programs Steve was reading a Chapter from “Walking With Spring” by Earl Shaffer (1st Thruhiker). I counted backwards and am listening forward to where he is reading chapter one, probably tomorrow.  But the programs I have listened too are all inspirational stories.  Each Thru Hiker has their own story as they hike along and this program does a great job of highlighting that story.   I would turn off the program anytime other hikers were around.  I came up on Recon just off the trail starting lunch so I asked if I could join him.  While eating Gravity, Gypsy, Amber and Paul passed by.  The youth can go pretty fast!  Yet an hour later I caught up with them as they filtered water and ate lunch.  I sat for a few and then Paul let me just Top off my water from his filter bag.  Awesome because I wasn’t going to do it at that point but wait  much later.  As it was, I didn’t get water again until we were at camp
for the night!  One less “Chore”. He asked me how Recon was getting along without Poles.  I then heard that when Recon met up with old friends in Hampton Tn., he left his trekking poles in their car and on the way back to Vermont.  I told Paul that I could get by with just my right pole and didn’t always use the left.  When Recon showed up hiking with a stick, I made the offer to him.  He gladly accepted and then figure when he would hit Troutdale and hoping too get there before I did; to get his poles from the mail/Post Office and  return my one pole to me.  Personally, I figured it would all work out and didn’t stress the details which I normally would!  Off Recon went and fast! I think he decided to hike longer miles to get ahead and beat the Post Office operating time clock!  I hiked awhile with Amber and discussed  Pod Casts programs for Church Sermons.  When I get service, I am going to download some.  I was surprised when suddenly we were at Lost Mountain Shelter and the plan was to stop at the next campsite.  As we finished the last mile, I was surprised how easy those miles were and how much time we had to sit around camp.  Everyone set up and then pre hung bear bag ropes and started preparing dinner.  I looked over and a fire in the established Ring was already a blaze.  I suddenly realized that I wasn’t solo any more.  I didn’t really judge it yet, because I know that I can have alone time by hiking one mile more or even less than the group.  So no pressure.  I tried to get service by waking around and holding up the phone, but no communication with home tonight.  Remembered it was Friday night but then suddenly realized that on the trail, days of the week lose their significance. I returned to the fire ring and was content to sit and just enjoy the entire scene. Finally, Gypsy said he was off to bed.  I said I was older in age and followed him.  I joked with him that not only do we wake by age but must also retire for the night by age.  He agreed and chuckled.   The Day had come full circle.","Damascus

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587887,"When my daughters were little, a toy line of little varied colored plastic ponies started.  Of course the Ponies were not too costly but the carrying case and all accessories cost more than hay to feed a live pony. However, the girls did love them.  Who can’t resist a little pony?  That’s what today was mainly about.  We climbed White Oak Mtn. which was tougher than we thought it would or should be.  Then descended and started a climb up Mt Rogers (the tallest in Virginia) that included a grassy bald half way up.  Beautiful to look back at distant Mountain ranges as we climbed.  But like all balds was windy and no one stays long.  The trail curves and drops to climb again without summiting. The Summit is not part of the AT and the guide book says that it is “viewless”; Thru Hikers don’t need any extra miles!  Coming to the Summit side trail and Thomas Knob Shelter, I suffered fall number three!  Was planning to Rock Hop across a
Small stream that
The trail passes over.  However, the first rock did the hopping, throwing me off balance. I learned from science that
once my body started falling, it continued to fall until stopped by the ground or other objects.  In this case it was both; trees to break the ultimate fall to the ground. Luckily, my left pole was with Recon so I did use my left hand to slow the inevitable, which saved me from a serious shoulder injury I am sure. The right trekking pole wasn’t so lucky and bent under the weight of holding me back. Though bent, it continued to work the rest of the day and is valued for it’s willingness to serve and protect me. Laying there once again, i gave myself time to recollect and inventory my aches and pains.  Feeling pretty strong, I tried to get back to my feet, much like a turtle that is balanced on a rock in the center off its back.  It took a minute or so before I was upright, crossed the small stream and back on trail for me to realize my shin was bleeding as I updated the
Damage from fall number two.  While inspecting my shin and pulling up a sock to soak the blood, I noticed my left thumb, hand and fingers where bleeding.  Best to let them bleed and hopefully clean out the wounds.  Then my Rt. Pointer Finger really started to ache.  Not fracture hurt, but sprained knuckle type hurt.  Oh well, had to keep going.  Luckily within minutes, I was at the Shelter, where everyone noticed the bent pole.  Amber got me wet wipes and once clean of blood, my hand and shin didn’t look all the bad.  She picked some cedar splinters out of a couple of cuts, but not much more could be done.  So on my way into the Grayson Highlands, known for wild ponies.  Of course there was a lot more evidence of ponies, than actual ponies for a mile or so.  We
got Trail Magic Candy from Roud and Splash AT 15’, as well as an update the the first pony we saw wasn’t worth walking to because plenty more were along the trail as we would loop around the State Park.  They were correct but first we past the 500 mile mark, which was not noted in any way. Probably because the terrain is so different in that it is mountains, but few trees, with grassy areas, small shrubs and volcanic rocky outcroppings.  It is a unique distinct area of its own and one that was fun to hike through.  We also went through a small rock formation called “The Fat Man Squeeze”. We are down enough weight that it wasn’t to difficult to pass through, but there was a white blaze in the center of it.  Shortly after that, we interacted with one then a second pony just to the right of the trail.  You have to watch them because they will lick and the bite clothing and packs to get at the sweat salt.  Although it is early and we haven’t been super hot and sweaty, we discovered that there is some salt on our gear.  Once everyone had time with the ponies, we hiked on.  We needed to get past the Wise Shelter because we were in a no camping zone.  The hike had turned very rocky and everyone was getting tired and frustrated with not being able to stride out or step at a normal Cadence, making the day long and tiring.  I thought maybe it was just me due to the fall, but found everyone was ready for camp.  We finally hit Wise Shelter and you could tell where tenting was allowed because it was packed!  We went further, but flat ground was again, already taken. I have a different concern. In this terrain, it can be hard to find trees to hammock from. But a mile later, we found a stream, flat land, and trees around a fire ring.  Once again, Amber had the fire going by the time everyone was gathered around to cook and eat dinner.  My first course was two Advil’s filled then by Knorr Taco Rice and Mango Chipotle Tuna.  I hike a little ways to try and get cell service but we are tucked in low before an early morning climb out.  I did get a few text messages to Joanie, but still painful not to have unlimited service and time to chat.  Returning to the group, there were no huge logs to burn, so everyone started turning in an hour before Hiker midnight.  We all are a little concerned with the Ponies coming around to bother us as we sleep but I think they are probably higher up now that it is warmer.  Currently I am listening to the Spring peepers which is a soothing sound and a sign that maybe Spring is finally here, although the nights are cold and sometimes getting below freezing.  I am not complaining though!","Stealth Camp 487.3

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587892,"It’s hard to believe that last Sunday was the day the trail stopped and everyone looked for Shelter from the Thunderstorms. Then over night it turned cold and everyone looked for shelter to dry out and get warm.  It seems impossible that it was just last week.   This Sunday morning was quite Chilly and filled with condensation moisture in the air. Once camp was broken and I hit the Trail, everything warmed up very quickly. I saw a couple ponies close by and took a video of the unique terrain, not realizing it would change so quick.  I came across cattle and actually had a huge black  bull on the trail between me and the gate I need to get through.  As I cautiously approached, it moved to the left and around the corner, like it knew where it was going without the aid of a white blaze.  I hurried through the gate which can be difficult because each latch is different and unique to how it operates.  Once through, I crossed the “scales” to get to another gate, but stopped and went back to the modern Privy/Outhouse.  A Thru Hiker never passes one up!   Then back up a hill that
eventually lead me back to familiar woods.  At the 1st Shelter, “Old Orchard”, I swung in for a quick mid morning break.  To my surprise, there was Recon!  He thanked me for the pole and said it helped.  He rushed to get to Troutdale the previous day, but realizing he wouldn’t make it, he slowed and had really enjoy the Grayson Highlands.  Easy Pete and Irish Paul showed up and talked about trail Magic provided by the guy doing interviews for You Tube!  I asked if not was a guy named, “Jimmy” and they confirmed that it was.  Dang, he has been ahead of me and now he was behind me by a mere two or three hours! Lol. I asked Recon if he wanted some company as he had to slow for today to get his poles from the Post Office Tomorrow, Monday, morning.  He said, “Sure”, so when Amber and Paul showed up, I explained that I wasn’t heading 20 miles to Timpii Shelter but was sticking with Recon.  Recon had given me back my left pole as we started to hike, but the cuts in my thumb hurt, so I told him to take it back for the day.  I laid back on the uphill so I could listen to some Praise Songs for this Sunday.  I really enjoyed hearing a Song called, “Author of the World” or maybe it’s “Walk with Me” but it s awesome on a Sunday in the Woods.  Later, I caught up and we hit the road crossing for Troutdale.  No luck getting a hitch there, so we started up the road that goes 21/2 miles into Troutdale Va.  I would pray every time a car would come, and we would stick out our thumbs.  We almost had given up hope when a pick up pulled over and we hopped in the back.  He asked, “Church Hostel?”  and we were on are way, taken directly to the front of the Bunkhouse.  The Care taker was out, but a forestry worker that stays there as well told us to just take our stuff in and then get a shower and the care taker would be back anytime.  The bunch house is two rooms, one for women and one for men.  Each has two bunks (upper and lower) to hold four people. No mattress, so once again the Neo Air Pad saves me again. They do provide pillows with clean pillow cases, as well as a microwave and coffee maker.  A cloths line and water are close by as well as a portajohn. The shower is an outside entrance behind but part of the church building.  It was the perfect temperature and they provide towels, hotel size shampoo and soap!  They even have full size toothbrushes but no hiker would ever carry that weight!  Lol. The caretaker showed up and actually helped me hammer the sections of my bent pole apart.  We then cleaned and oiled the pieces, sliding them back together.  It doesn’t collapse fully, like the left one, but will do for the meantime.  I am still sore today and my Rt pointer finger is definitely swollen, but all in all I am good and have to trust that the Lord will heal.  It did make me remember my childhood prior to 911 and Rescue Squads.  I fell off a roof in 7th grade and was driven by station wagon to the hospital. I also remember my Dad tearing up his hands and body, only to let it heal however it healed!  Sometimes not the best outcome but in some ways, I feel, older generations had to be tougher than what we have to be today.  On the trail, I have to just Keep the Faith and Keep HikN^.  This evening I did get two bars and standing halfway up a hill and turning one specific direction, I was able to chat with Joanie.  Her support and strength is unbelievable. A lot of hikers quit because of personal issues and lack of support!  I am so fortunate, but it does make me miss her all the more.  It’s not even dark yet, but close to 8:00 and I am actually tired.  So no Hiker midnight for myself or Recon.","Stealth Camp 504

Recon slept late (for him) and was making coffee when I swung my legs over the bunk.  While packing up, my 6:30 alarm went off.  We ate breakfast, drank coffee and just relaxed waiting for the Post Office to open at 8:30.  We walked down the street and entered shortly after it opened only to find out that the packages weren’t there yet.  Recon asked about when today’s delivery would arrive and the Postal Worker said she thought it may be out back and unloading now.  She went out and then her and a worker named John went through all the delivery to pull out the three boxes.  Awesome service and Recon was so relieved.  We walked next door to see if we could get a ride with Ronnie (from our hitch yesterday) set for an hour later, but no one answered.  John came out and offered us a ride to the trail head but we needed time to finish packing for the day.  He then drove us the short distance to the bunk house, gave us his number and said if we needed anything while close to Marion Va. to give him a call. Super nice.  The Caretaker heard we needed a ride and couldn’t get ahold of Ronnie so he said Ross would take us when he got back in less than an hour.  Recon went through his packages, unboxing his poles, repackaging food and then he opened a box from his daughter Kate
and said Ally had a hand in this, when he tossed me a bag of Oatmeal Raisin Cookies.  I had one then another!  Would have had the whole bag if I hadn’t hide them, they were soooo good!  Matter of fact I was going to eat another at lunch but we were at a shelter with two Tennessee guys hiking southbound for a month and I couldn’t find them.      In reality, I am a bad person and didn’t want to share, because they are so good.  Once we were all set, the rain was coming down hard.  However, by the time Ross pulled in and swung around to take us back to the trail head, it had slowed tremendously.  As it turned out, we stayed dry all afternoon, until we hit Partnership Shelter.  We decided this was the place to stay for the night and set up in the Shelter (Pad saved me again).  There were lots of poles outside but only one guy in the corner and he looked like he wasn’t  a hiker or feeling the best.  He did tell us about the visitors center and that everyone that was going to be in the shelter upstairs, was in town. “Oblivious” that we had leap frogged on the trail earlier, showed up and looked around deciding that this would be his first night in a shelter if there was room. I had space next to me, so he went to work unpacking as we asked if he wanted in on Pizza so we could hit the $30 minimum to get it delivered.  Recon and I went down to the Center and used the phone to order!  It was only suppose to take a half hour, but we stood in the rain by the gate kiosk for closer to and hour.  When it arrived it was $5 to $10 more than we planned so I think the guy already charged his tip.  However the Chicken Sub and fries we split and then the pizza was great and so filling!  We
couldn’t finish the last piece and Oblivious was full as well, so we offered it to the guy in the corner.  We also loved the liter of Dr Pepper between the three of us (I probably had the most because Recon limits his pop intake). A ridge runner (trail name OK) came up to the shelter bearing cans of Coke.  (I joked that he was Better than OK, when he brought even more Coke from his vehicle later). We took some of the cans and again we past one back to the guy in the corner. The other hikers returned from town and it happened to be Gypsy, Kenyon, Gravity, Jinx, Seven and Amber!  They are occupying the upstairs which isn’t open to the outside but seemed dark and dank to me.  Cool to see them again! As we started to get cold and settle in, Recon passed an Energy Bar to the guy very discreet and nonchalant, so cool.  It was funny though, because later Oblivious joked about Recon just trying to get rid of pack weight and using the guy to that end.  The guy joked and said he was willing to help any way possible!  Just an example of treating others with Respect and without judgement, which sums up Recon and the way he is.  I am seeing and experiencing the best in people on the trail and always praying that it changes me for the better and we’ll stick with me long after my time on the trail ends.","Troutdale Church & Hostel (Dickey Gap)

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587897,"Partnership Shelter was a great shelter to stay in.  It’s strange, because
of the padding and air mattress having to go in the bottom of the pack, not much time is saved versus breaking camp.  I was still out before 8 and we stopped at the Mt Rogers Visitors Center to take a look around.  The area is huge and it helped us get an idea of where we had been.  Then we started hiking.  It’s great to be hiking with Recon again.  I did hang back after awhile so I could listen to Mighty Blue on the AT, instead of the rain patter.  We hit a Shelter for a snack, but Recon mentioned the School House at the Settlers Village just being two miles away.  I stated that I thought they usually had trail magic there and if they didn’t, it would still be a great place to get out of the rain. We hiked on trying to avoid puddles but failing and getting wetter by the minute.  It is usually a harder rain in less dense Forrest and open Meadow areas.  Of course that was what the terrain was today.  We hit a sign that stated Trail Magic at the Old School provided by The United Methodists Church of Wyethville Va.  We rounded the corner and to our left was the School House with  two separated Outhouses.  Just like it was plucked from “Little House on the Prairie”.  My Daughter actually played the role of Ma Engles when she toured with Arts Power Production a few years back! We entered and it was set up with the old school desk, interesting rules for the teacher and students on the wall and box crates to the left of the door.  The chalkboard up front gave some history about the opening date of 1894 and closing in 1937.  The School only was in session from October through March!   I could have hiked the AT every year instead of waiting to retire!   We thought the trail magic was just lemonade, sweet tea and water with cups; however, when you opened up the crates there was more!  Sodas in a cooler and all sorts of hygiene products.  I resupplied my hand sanitizer and grabbed some toothpaste and baby wipes!  There were nail clippers and so many other items but those were left for those in need.  Really a cool set up.  We did eat lunch and left a donation in the box.   There was a wood burning stove in the middle of the room, but it wasn’t in use.  We got chilled so we headed on quickly after eating.  It was fairly easy hiking and we made great time, although the trail was starting to get slick.  We crossed a Railroad Track and I thought of the old hobo riders and those travelers, not unlike us thru hikers. As we came out and looked down to the valley, I81 and the Adkins interchange became visible.  It didn’t take long to cross the road and hit the Sunoco Truck Station.  It didn’t look like much of a resupply for me so we headed up to the Exon Station. I picked up Ramon Noodles but it wasn’t much better.  Recon and I both needed Tortilla Shells and they had nothing.  Recon takes to a guy staying at Relax Inn Motel and got a report that it wasn’t bad for the price.  Recon asked if I wanted to split a room and call it a day!  Did I ever!  So we skipped returning to Sunoco and went to get a room. We looked at a Single but decided on a double for the space.  The motel clerk was running the Hammock guy from last night into town for $10 bucks if I wanted to split the cost with him.  I jump at the chance when I heard Dollar General!  The good Lord provided me with a great resupply!  I was able to get shells and tuna packets for both Recon and myself and now be able to get to Woods Hike Hostel, our next projected stop.  The rest of the afternoon has been drying gear and a great hot shower.  Hoping to get got up on Awols Guide and weather report for rest of the week as well as a chance to chat with Joanie.  Life is good when dry!","Partnership Shelter

We went through Meadows and over pasture lands. We came to one reroute for this year as designated by being off trail on Guthooks App and watching a couple of hikers hike downhill when the path was blocked and an Arrow was pointing to switchback up the trail.  The were rather upset when they reached us eating lunch.  The one said, “That’s a half hour on the trail that I will never get back!”  In my past I would have gone down the same path of negativity, but with Recons help today, I realized the trail owes us nothing, the blazes aren’t required by some Law, and we are just lucky to have this footpath and experience.  I was just grateful to be hiking (instead of indoors working) and glad to not have rain today like yesterday.  The reroute was probably done to better secure National Forest Land that extends on both sides of the Trail and local property owners and their easement concerns.  Recon pointed out the “Bearing” Trees and “Witness” Trees that show where property lines are.  I also saw Red Rings for National Forest Boundaries and Yellow Blazes to mark the boundary of the AT just like the White Blazes mark the path.  We have seen a lot of “Stiles” (which are like step ladders up and over barb wire fencing) that aren’t in service any more.  Yet today we climbed over about four or five of them that were very necessary.  We also passed two signs that warned that the “AT Passes through a narrow corridor that includes a scenic Tread right of way easement through private property. Use outside the Trail Tread requires written permission of the Land Owner”.  Again, as a hiker, I am glad
That the trail is here and don’t want any bad will with the owners of the land bordering this Foot Path!  The one rerout did bring us closer to a Hostel .3 Miles up a road.  The name was Quarter Way Inn and Hostel.  Stupid me didn’t realize that it was named this because we are One quarter way into our Journey that will hopefully end at Katahdin!  Now being an educator, I am will aware of four quarters, two semesters and the halfway mark being “Winter Break”.  One quarter is not that big of a deal, but you have to get it done with to be on your way to the half way mark.  All in all it was pretty cool to think about over dinner.  Early start means early to bed which won’t be to difficult because the patter of light raindrops is hitting my tarp.

To the south is open Grassy land that formed the last of our climb.  But to the North was a beautiful view of a farm valley way below and enclosed like a crater by mountains.  It is a unique Geological Formation called Burke’s Garden; and only has one natural outlet to the north and only two roads out.  A Hawk flew across from our left to right and accomplished in minutes the eighth Miles that would take us hours.  We spent a lot of time their because it had the best cell coverage we have had in a week.  We did hike on to have lunch at a rock overview.  Key word is rock and it should be plural!  Once again, slow going and no real ability to get in stride. We did make ok time to Va Route 623 which is one of the roads out of Burke’s Garden.  Gary from Chillicothe Ohio had been there for 7 days, so Magic was limited.  Recon showed his talents, whipping up two pancakes with peanut butter on top, one for each of us, in short order.  Amazing to see, and tasted great as well. While filtering water there, Kenya, Gypsy, Gravity, and Jinx strolled in. Recon joked that they wouldn’t have caught us if we didn’t take a two hour nap at Chestnut Knob!  We all ended at the same shelter tonight.  Paul and Amber are still out in front, though.  They will probably pull ahead because Recon is planning a Zero at Woods Hole Hostel and I think I am sticking with him there.  I have only had one zero in Franklin and really should rest my body totally. I have just gotten use to Nero’s.  Once again the patter of raindrops is hitting my tent, just as forecasted.  I don’t care as long as it clears when hiking during the day!  We ended up at 15 miles for the day because we just never got into stride.  Yet, we are well within the mileage to hit Woods Hole in three days.","VA Route 625

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588205,"During the morning Hike, we could just tell it was going to be a great day to hike.  It started with wake up excitement.  As usual, Tom was up around 4:30 a.m. and went to walk uphill behind the shelter / camp.    I had just stirred in my hammock and was debating getting up or waiting for the 5:30 Alarm.  Suddenly, I heard, “Go on! Get!” Followed by some whistling.  Wide awake now, I knew that may mean bear!  So I debated going to get my food bag.  Easy debate, warm bed vs damp air and possibility of Bear. I soon saw a headlight bouncing off my tarp as Recon returned. I asked about the encounter and he said, “Just beyond that tree around the short pines, I saw two yellow eyes staring at me.  Don’t know if it was bear or Coyote, but I know it wasn’t Deer.  What ever it was, it scooted up off to the left and scattered.  I think it was a Bear.”  We May never know, but I’m glad it was Recon and not me.  I did grab my food bag quicker than normal!  It was nice because it rained all night, but stopped when we broke camp, and hasn’t rained since!  No rain always makes for a great day.  Actually, the sun has been shaded by passing clouds and we love it because the air temperature is perfect for hiking. Not to hot and not to cold.  The trail was great as well.  No major climbs over 600 feet, with good switchbacks.  A major morning portion was on an old logging or horse carriage road, just below and following the ridge.  It would swoop out and give a great view of the valley below and curve back into the hollow to swing back out and give another view.  We saw a town (believed to be Bland VA) off to the Northwest and knew we were headed to it.  A debate occurred over a structure just up from the city.  Old sign, possible Water Tower, No longer used fast food post?  In another hour we passed by it and it turned out to be a huge electric stand.  While looking at it, we found a cell tower which meant great cell coverage for a few miles. We headed down the road, until we saw the “Bushy Mtn. Outpost”, with tons of packs lining the front of the building.  Inside we found hiker heaven!  Burgers, Fries, Drinks and two long shelves of Resupply items.  Lunch was great, the cup of pecan ice cream was even better.  I picked up a can of fuel, lighter, and one packet of spam (everything that was emptied last night).  A little bit of Facebook joking with my daughter Alicia, as
She questioned all this diner hopping! A few text with Joanie and we were on our way down the road.  The road turns over a bridge that carried us over I 77. It caused me to remember a trip to Charlotte Motor Speedway with my daughter; and driving her crazy when I saw the AT sign. I really loved that trip but must admit that it was surreal walking over what we had sped under.  Soon we were back in the woods and the traffic was fading in the distance.  The great hiking continued until we hit Helvey’s Mill Creek Shelter, .3 off the trail.  We didn’t need the shelter but this was the last water for 7 miles.  Recon was awesome because he went for water while I watched the packs.  Good for me but bad for him!  Turns out the water was another .3 beyond the shelter which meant a 1.2 mile round trip.  When he returned, I hung the heavy water on an S Biner on the back of the pack.  We hiked on and when we discussed stopping for the day, I would joke that I could hike another 1.2 miles for sure.  Reality was that water weight is heavy and throws everything out of balance.  When Recon found a great spot, I went for it.  An easy hang, beautiful view and cell signal to call home on a Friday night.  Can’t beat that kind of hiking day!","Jenkins Shelter

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588484,"Today was my earliest start on the trail.  Recon was up at 4 am and gone by 5:45.  I woke at 5 but still took an hour and a half to break camp.  Don’t know how to get any faster, unless I skip breakfast.   Not sure it would matter, it is what it is and what am I rushing for anyway!  In an hour I crossed a road and on the far side was the 600 mile mark set in sticks.  Took a pic and then laid down and took a selfie!  No hollowing though, as these come about weekly now and it’s not my power but God’s Grace that
Is keeping me on the trail.  It could end with one misstep or fluke injury.  However, some celebration of these moments must take place to reach any major goal.  The trail was smooth and I got into a rhythm probably doing 2.7 miles per hour if not more.  Meet up with Recon at ten instead of the projected lunch.  It is great hiking with him because he doesn’t miss much.  We saw our 1st Snakes out sunning themselves today. A little green Garter by Water, a four and a half foot Black Snake in leaves to the side of the trail and finally another larger garter snake along the side of the trail.  The black snake was fun because it was the largest and moved with purpose looking for food.  Can’t take anything from the garters, they act all big and tough!  I had planned on swinging by Trent’s Grocery Store but when it turned out to be .5 West (1 Mile Round Trip), I decided to skip it.  No major needs.  Just wanted a bottle of Gatorade and some powder packets and I can always use a Coke Zero!  But instead, I moved on and filtered water from a stream.  We finally arrived at Dismal Trail that leads .3 to a waterfall.  We debated leaving packs (like others had) but decided carrying was easier than grabbing lunch items.  About .2 miles we pulled to the right and took advantage of a campsite to eat.  Then finished the .1 to the Falls.  Nice but very similar to Abrams Falls in the Smokies.  Matter of fact, I like Abrams better.   Still nice and Recon put
On trunks and went in for a few.  Yes he said it was ice cold!  Not me, I hate cold water!  We didn’t spend as much time as we thought we would and by the time we stopped hiking at 3:30 or so, we had past the campsite we had planned.  We debated 1.2 miles to the next shelter, but prefer to avoid crowds.  The difference is 8.4 or 10.2 miles to Woods Hole Hostel tomorrow, Sunday.  Actually, it was nice to leisurely set up camp, filter water, and eat Knorrs Teriyaki Noodles with Spicy Pink Salmon!  I also threw the tarp back on itself so it’s open to the front while typing this.  It was shocking to find we had 18.4 Miles.  I could get use to this!  However, tomorrow starts with a climb.  The other said part is that we don’t have cell service here.  Oh well, another early restful night of sleep in the hammock.","Stealth Camp 597.5

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588487,"Woke up at 6:15 because no need to rush with under 10 miles for the day.  Easy camp breakdown and on the trail at 8:00.  Had some muddy creek/stream crossings that Recon hopped across, but last Saturday’s fall is still fresh in my mind so I choose a route slowly.  Past a pond that would have been loving to camp around but a little more crowded than we like.  Then the climb started.  I took off the jacket and put on a sermon Pod Cast and Recon was gone.  A German guy and asked if we were ready for dee climb and Recon took that as a challenge and left him (and me, lol) in his dust!  The climb did increase the lung and heart output, but ended as less of a challenge than most previous climbs, including Chestnut Knob. At the top, I had some service so texted Joanie.  I then passed a bunch of foreign bandanna flags and wasn’t sure what that was about.  Later at a rock outcrop that overlook the valley below and mountains to the east, I couldn’t resist and called Joanie!  She joked about being left all alone with only the dog Titan to love her.  Later I found out she was filling the time by shopping for items to redecorate the Guest Bedroom.  More power to her, I am trying to do this hike with a loose budget staying under a certain amount that has been set aside.  The German Hiker past me while I was on top and later I caught him up the trail.  He was staring at a stick sign that said, “623 M” on top of “1,000 KM”.  Stupid American that I am, I stared at the 623 and didn’t get the significance until he asked me to take his picture for completing 1,000 KM!  Now I got it! He said he just put the sticks together because a lot of foreigners are hiking the trail, which is quite true.    I fist bump him to celebrate and took three photos and hiked on.  Neither of us realizing that the bandannas was trying to mark the same 1,000 KM just a little earlier.  Recon helped me figure that out later down the trail!  Soon I checked Guthooks and we were 1.6 from the road to Woods Hole Hostel.  At are rate we were soon at the road and finding the sign directing us to the left fork and .5 miles to go. I joked that I didn’t do .5 for Trent’s Grocery Yesterday so I hope this .5 ends in a Soda!  Recon chuckled at that.  We came down the hill and to the right was a beautiful, updated 1880’s Chestnut Log Cabin with a Bunkhouse to the left, flowing water with a small pond and Animal Pens for sheep and hogs, with cows up a way. There were also numerous herb and vegetable gardens used in the communal breakfast and diners.  Shower and Laundry are always first on the hostel stay list.  Relaxing afternoon eating some late lunch, snack bars, and of course Dr Pepper and Mtn Dew that will make me go broke when I check out!  Met a Southbounder named Cougar that confirmed or Resupply and Hostel Plans to get through the Shenandoah’s and to Northern VA.  While returning to the porch to check on laundry, who do see?  None other than Sassafras!  She had caught up after doing a couple of longer days.  She was icing new shoes and hoping they would help get her Mortons Neuroma calmed again.  It seems that some days she could avoid the pad, while other days it was a definite requirement!  It was great to see her and I sat between her and Recon at dinner. Dinner was served at 7:00 (our normal bedtime) but was worth staying up for.  I had a second helping of Salad. Love the veggies in town!  It was topped off with a homemade ice cream cone.  It is a cool place and Neville (daughter of the original owner operator Tilley) works hard to insure everyone is at home and taken care of.  Turning in at 10:00 so a late night tonight!","Stealth Camp 615.9

Tried to go back to sleep for an hour but it didn’t happen.  So I got dressed (hopefully quiet enough) and went downstairs to read.  Cougar was up and getting ready to leave for Pearisburg and a Hostel there.  We had contemplated doing the same thing but really needed the Zero.  It worked out that Nevelle needed to get a State Vehicle inspection, so she was going into Town for a few hours.  Four of us went and three came back.  She dropped us off at the Food Lion Grocery Store and said she would pick us up there and drive over to Walmart.  However, we were done with our Resupply a lot quicker than her. So plans changed and Recon and I headed to Wally World by foot, using Google Maps for walking instead of Driving!  One mile from one
Store to the next. We finished off our Resupply and I looks for pants (no go) and Emergen C but it was a pack of 30! To many and to much weight! Had time so checked out Goodwill for pants but none were good enough. Then over too McDonald’s to kill time and of course eat and drink soda!   Recon shared some Gelato Ice Cream that was melting.  It was better than the Wendy’s Frosty next door!  Strange McDonald’s, four TV’s and all were on Fox  News Channel. We didn’t even watch.  Got picked up from there and then back to the hostel.  Oh, on the road leaving we
Saw two deer and on the way back we saw a Wild Turkey!  We stopped at a neighbors house to pick up jars of dairy milk, later used to make the homemade ice cream for desert.  We unloaded the milk and carried our Resupply bags to the bunk room. Now came the task of dividing the food staples into breakfast, lunch, dinner Ziplocks for one food bag or the snack pile for another food bag.  I also have a hot drink packet ziplock, as well as an electorate /small candy ziplock.  The latter goes in the waist pack with four snack bars a day.  I repaired my Rock  sac with KT tape because the CF had small tears in it.  Not sure of the durability of the Z Packs Bear Bag Kit but to be fair, it is an older earlier model.  I went through my first aid kit and nothing much could be removed.  My kit is basically staying the same as day one.  I ate lunch again, forgetting the stop at McDonald’s.  Drank a couple of Sodas.  Had some Ice Cream.  Laid in a rope hammock and read.  Did some stretches.  Changed from elastic laces on the left shoe back to regular laces to better hold my foot because I am getting pain like that of a fifth metatarsal stress fracture.  Did some more stretches and started to watch hikers come into the hostel late afternoon.  A new Hiker named Halfmoon said Tank and Tag Along we’re hiking on but said hello.  May catch them again tomorrow.  Snow Angel from Black Bear Resort is here and a very nice couple early to mid sixties was chatting with us as we ate dinner.  We chose to skip tonight’s Communal Meal and will get the breakfast before heading out in the
morning.  Even more hikers showed, so the Bunkhouse is more filled than last night.  It will be nice to hike on, without stopping in Pearisburg tomorrow and just
keep going.  We were in a small lapse between groups and it
Would be nice to get back into that semi seclusion.  Already in bed while everyone is eating in the main house, so tonight is an early to sleep night and hopefully a great ending to a Zero Day.","Woods Hole Hostel

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589045,"Without Cell Service and after a hard, Hot day of hiking; it is easy to fall asleep even before the sun goes down.  If snoring by 8:30 p.m. it’s easy to wake refreshed at 5 a.m., especially on a wooden shelter floor.  As shelters go, this one didn’t have mice and on this night was extremely comfortable. It doesn’t save much camp breakdown time because of the Neo Air mattress having to be deflated and into the pack liner bag first; as well as the Barca Lounger pad that goes in first.  Then you have to pack everything else in the order you would anyway.  It does save time on tarp take down, as well as hammock tree straps.  The work day started for me at 6:15.  I say work day, because this is what happens occasionally, starting in Virginia and is why I think some hikers claim to get the Virginia Blues.  The Romance of the trail and the glorious ideas a hiker starts Springer with are long gone due to the extreme effort it takes to keep moving North.  Many get stuck in Towns, taking Zeros, and slowing losing ground needed to insure Katahdin stays a possibility. You no longer are seeing great views at every turn, or changing scenery from the woods of Georgia, to the Great Smokey Mountains, to the Bald’s of NC and Tennessee.  Not that Virginia is t beautiful.  When the trail is smooth and your on a Ridgeline, you can look into the valley between Mountain Ranges.  There are also times when you hike right out of the woods and cross a meadow with Cows and farms near by that are picturesque.  Yet the majority of the day is spent climbing which ends in Volcanic Jagged rocks or descents that include boulders and step downs that strain the knees.  My feet actually ache 24/7.  Water is less abundant, so there are more miles between stops and the back is sore from the two pounds per liter!  With the last two days being in the mid 80’s, shirt and pack straps are caked in white salt from sweat, a sign that you are to double ur drinking amount.  All of this slows the mph and leads to long days for shorter miles.  Today we did well to get 18 miles done in 10 hours.  Not including Lunch and a water stop that turned into ice baths for the feet.  Actually, that was the highlight of the day.  How many people can stop working, find a cold clear rushing stream and soak the pain (freeze the pain in my case) right out of their feet.  It is invigorating and soothing.  I hope to repeat it more often. I also dipped my face in the water, as well as scooping some cool water in my hat for my head!  The wonderful thing is that everyone else feet and hair look like your homeless so no one judges!  We finally found a spot just off trail, just below Keefer Oak Tree (First thing in Morning!) and by 5:00 Quitting time!  Tomorrow will be another 15 to 20 Mile workday, but nothing to stressful because are plan is to be at Four Pines Hostel Semi early on Saturday for a two day Resupply, a meal at The Home Place Restaurant (None for great food for Thru Hikers and Families) and hopefully to avoid some rain coming in.  We have slowed a little to stay shy of one bubble but ahead of another.  A SOBO confirmed today, as well as seeing a FB Post by Easy Pete, that the 20 Mile closure of the AT due to the Catawba Brush Fires; opened yesterday!  Praise God, I prayed that it would work out this way!  That section of trail (is still work) but has so many points of interest to many people, not just Thru Hikers.  But until the, the work week continues.  I just keep hoping that I don’t struggle and slow to much that I physically get injured or mentally give in to slipping from the trail.  In that sense, I don’t want to lose this line of work!  So I tell myself that this is better than anything else I could be doing for six months and hoping that this will see me thru.  I now know that this is not easy, is hard work, and without the right attitude it is easy to leave the trail. I have learned that those who do leave are not quitters but have learned what the trail meant for them to learn.  Recon had the best line today when he was as frustrated with the Volcano Rocks as I was, he said, “If it was easy, everyone would be out here and then what fun would that be for us!” So off to bed and up early for work in the morning!","Bailey Gap Sheltet

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589168,"We camped in the Shadow of the Keefer Oak Tree, so it started our Friday Work Day off great.  It is over 300 Years Old and 2nd Largest on the AT (Largest in the South). It has endured the test of time and has stood strong!  A limb broke off last year and was laying close by. That branch was thicker than the tree trunk I hung my hammock from the previous night.    The trunk is huge and I was amazed when I took a pic of it with Recon standing next and giving it some perspective.  Simply Amazing.  We the. Walked into a pasture clearing with the sun not just yet over the mountain, but the light of dawn breaking around us.  A mother cow and her calf walked right in front of us by not more than ten feet.  The curious calf stood but ran when momma was too many steps ahead.  Other smaller calf’s stayed close to there mom’s up on the hillside as we past down below and slowly climbed into the woods.  A fairly long climb that we had put off till fresh in the morning light.  Reaching the top, it was work as usual; however the morning was filled with views.  The best being in an area called “The Ledges”.  Rock Outcropping with wilderness views to the South East.  I think we saw one actual farm and house; otherwise it was just green trees with the shadows of the sun creating great definition to the mountain range.  The rocks on a slant made hiking a little difficult; so one has to stop for the view or keep focused on the trail!  It’s hard on the feet and ankles, but what isn’t these days! A sign declared “The Eastern Continental Divide”, a cool disinflation that water to our left (West side) flows to the Mississippi and Gulf of Mexico, while water to the right (East Side) flows to the James River and Atlantic Ocean. Cool thought but then focus back to hiking and feet! What’s even worse for the toes and knees is the down hill!  But there is one section of trail down from the volcanic ridge that is Soft cushioning layers of pine needles.  Heaven for feet.  Once your drop low enough, your battling roots and dirt, with some washed out areas.  Also, the switch backs are often cut short by people that increases erosion only to save that hiker a few steps.  Almost always, it’s quicker to keep momentum and follow the trail maintainers chosen route!  At the bottom, we crossed a road and hiked to a footbridge for lunch.  Recon meet up with a hiker named Farmver, that lives 45 miles to the East of Recons Town.  It was cool to see this chance meeting and awesome that Recon got a little recognition from home.  I learned that when Recon’s original trail name was “Snackman” on the Long Trail.  I totally get it, because he pulls out a snack every hour on the trail!  Lunch was great but foot therapy in the river was as awesome as last night.  Water not quite as cold.  Oblivious (from before Adkins) showed up, took off boots and socks; walked to the middle of the stream getting on his hands and knees and then just rolling over in the water.  That’s one way to shower and do laundry all at once!  We headed up for the biggest climb of the day.  Work had returned! We also were committed to  seven miles before the next water source, so we had every bottle filled fully.  This means carrying a great deal of water weight!  Recon made it without stopping while listening to Chicago on his IPod.  I tried to listen to Mighty Blue on the AT but it stopped and I hadn’t reached the soft pine needle section.  Once I did and knew I was only 3/4 ways up; I pulled over, dropped the pack and drank electrolytes.  The temp was mid to upper 80’s and the sun was not really blocked because the leaves are still small at the higher elevations.  The rest stop did the trick because when I hit the Summit ridge line, I was ready to hike on.  Recon had caught his Vermont friend, so that slowed him.  There were also nice benches that you could sit at without removing your pack (a rare find).  These benches lined the way to the Audie Murphy Memorial.  A flag flies half mast behind the Granite Marker that is curled with American Flags, Dog Tags, Patches and other Keep sakes left in a sign of honor.  It was emotional for me, because you knew many men have worked through battle scars themselves and tried to lay it to rest at this Sacred Place of Honor.  For me, it drove home the Christian idea of laying things at the Cross, Just line many song lyrics say (if that makes sense). If nothing else, the Memorial drives home the sacrifice our Military men and women make for this great country!  The rest of the afternoon was sober work in the heat traveling back downhill giving up the altitude we had just gained. We knew we were close when we hear flowing water and then saw a UPS truck struggling on a gravel road.  We crossed the road and walked the footbridge, when we saw our German Hiking Friend Marcus or trail name Wilson from the Tom Hanks movie.  Once over the bridge, we knew that we needed water and our late afternoon foot therapy!  Recon turned to me and said, “This looks good for tonight, unless you want to climb another .9 Miles?” Was he insane?  Lol.  I look around and found some trees that would work and are actually a little protected by branches over head.  But while scouting the place out, a man walks over from a nearby house.  Instantly, we wonder if we are on private property.  But no worries, he assured us that we were fine and then showed us to two outhouses we could use tonight!  So cool!  Now we really could enjoy the water!  Recon was a lot braver than I, he Kaye’s down in the stream like Oblivious did earlier!  When finishing up, Larry and his Wife Veda (Travelers from Indiana) invited the three of us to dinner at a restaurant called “The Home Place”.  Stating that they had never been there but heard it was good.  Recon chuckled because this was the plan for dinner tomorrow night after we checked into a Hostel.  We didn’t want to wait and agreed to meet them at their Vehicle at 5:30.  I rushed to set up the hammock and tarp, as well as changing into my oversized town clothes.  Also, rushed to get water for later tonight.  Then the three hikers were piled into the back seat with our “Trail Angels” driving us down the back country roads.  Conversation just flowing, especially Marcus who has hiked the Carmen De Santiago!  “The Home Place” is a beautiful farm and homestead, converted to a family style restaurant.  We were worry about the wait, because packs and hikers were laying all over the front lawn and people were sitting all around the porch.  We saw so many hiking friends and once again Amber told me to eat up, I am much to thin!  We kept getting stopped on the way in and I really appreciated Larry and Vada’s patience because they were seated immediately.  After seeing Irish Paul and finding out that he fell and broke his nose so he was split from Easy Pete for awhile and was resting in Daleville, I finally sat down and instantly downed a glass of lemonade.  This was followed by Sweet Tea and glass after glass was consumed as the dinner was brought out. Three meats, Green Beans, coke slaw, Mac n cheese (the good stuff, not hiker boil in a bag) pork n beans, mash tators and gravy, biscuits and apple butter and the bowls keep coming and coming.  Finally, sensing everyone had their fill, the waitress asked about desert.  How I debated a bowl of creaming ice cream; but at this point, I was suddenly breaking out in cold sweat and felt like I could fall asleep right at the table.  I took off my glasses and tried resting my head in my ha dark with my eyes closed.  Recon and Marcus received their bowls of cream and it looked awesome.  But with my head spinning, I wasn’t sure what was going on.  I racists myself, and went to the rest room a bit wobbly.  When I returned to the table I felt slightly better.  We got up and each went to pay the bill, which was again a challenge for me to stay standing without leaning on something.  Once outside, I sat in a chair and understood the scene we had witness before entering.  Larry and Vada we gracious enough to allow us time on our phones because there is no signal back at camp.  I took this opportunity to call Joanie, and while way to quick and covering up the fact that I wasn’t 100%, it was great to touch base with her.  Walking to the car, I started to improve greatly and by the time I got back to camp, I wanted the ice cream!  I really wonder if I didn’t OD on sugar.  I think that many sugars and carbs in the food was a shock to my body.  I have heard of people feeing like they were suffering from food comatose, and I honestly feel that could be my issue. I am just glad it passed and am so appreciative of our Trail Angels for such a special evening on this wonderful journey.  I am tucked away in my hammock, listening to the pitter patter of rain on my tarp and the bubbling creek nearby.  A perfect lullaby to go to sleep with!","Stealth Camp 677.9

Instant climb that didn’t stop till the top, gave me time to reflect on last evening. It was so cool to see the connection between Vada and Larry.  With just a touch of his shoulder and a smile and the adventurous twinkle in Larry’s eye, you can tell that they match each other so well.      I hope that Joanie and I exude that type of love and marriage.   I think we do.  Yet, if I we were vacationing along the trail, I am not so sure we would invite grungy hikers to dinner in our car!  I am so glad they did, because we thoroughly enjoyed the magic and spending time with them.  I look to the right and saw the 700 mile marker spelled out in sticks.  Could that mean 1/3 of the way there? A little further I looked to the left and there was a beautiful view of the valley and road we travelled last night.  I also saw the Hostel we plan to stay later this afternoon.  The climb was tough this morning.  Hand over hand at some points until we hit the Dragons Tooth!  Maybe just a rock jutting up from the top of a mountain but a spectacular creation! So cool to spend time just walking around the site.  It was so humid but the sweat on my body actually cooled and chilled me till I started down.  The Southbound side (with a parking area for day hikers) was actually more difficult.  There was rebar ladders a couple of places and often trekking poles were useless because bare hands were needed to grab rock.  All in all, it was like being a kid again when rock scrambling was a requirement of any hike!  Finally the decent leveled as I passed the first Rhododendron in Bloom.  Small purple flower petals not fully opened but still a wonderful sight. I passed a ridge runner that asked where I came from and when he heard, “Trout Creek” he said that it was good that I beat the rain and was heading downhill.  I mentioned getting to Four Pines and he states that it was just below.  A little while later I spilled out on the road and turned right for .5 miles to get to the Hostel.  It is up a driveway and I was greeted right away and directed up to the three bay garage.  I was also asked if it was raining up above based on the dampness of my shorts!  I said no but super humid!  The garage has a couple of tables, a couch area for about 14 people and 7 Bunks.  All that was left were 3 Upper bunks so I grabbed two for Recon and I.  Then the typical Shower and laundry; however, the shower was cooler water now.  Early afternoon so plenty of time to relax the entire body! At 4pm everyone headed to The Home Place; but due to our magic we skipped it and headed to the Catawba Grocery (Gas, Pizza, and anything else) Store.  It was an expensive two day Resupply but did include Pizza, Chips, Dr Pepper and Ice Cream (since I missed it last night); as well as a ton of single snack bars which are expensive.  Oh well, the Trail seems to provide and work it out. Although I do need an Outfitter for Insoles and Slimmer Convertible Pants (I have lost maybe 4 to 6 inches).  This well happen in Daleville some 27 miles away.  It will all work out, I just need to keep the Faith!","VA 620 Trout Creek Mile 695.6

Lol.  We kept seeing dark clouds and actual Rain to the Northwest as we hiked up.  On a curve back towards the road we meet a Forest Fire Fighter.  She was eating lunch and watching hot rocks for flare ups and reignites.  A twenty mile section had been closed and just reopened three days earlier!  I had prayed that we wouldn’t have to be rerouted and come back to this section later and had Faith that it would work out.  Much like the Sermon and now I felt Joy!  Soon we came upon a group of seven Forest Fighters and it was easy to tell the foreman, by his commanding presence.  He said the fire apparently started by sparks from a trailer chain on Route 311 below.  They cleared the trail of debris and lit a backfire to burn down to the fire burning up from the road until they met and ran out of fuel.  Good strategy, because you could see how the fire didn’t cross the AT but stayed on the downhill side.  It smelled too!  We thank them for their service and getting it under control and moved on.  We then met a Ridge Runner who informed us that Lambert Shelter and Meadow was the last camping area and stopping there was a must or you’ve committed to going all the way into Daleville VA. He gave good intel on a great site with water and Bear Boxes beyond the Shelter that
most hikers don’t use because they stop short.  We thanked him for that information. Soon we were at McAfee Knob, one of the most photographed spots on the AT.  On cue, the Sun peeked through and the clouds gave an excellent backdrop. No wind either, which is unusual. We went to a second overlook and took some photos there until we didn’t hear any voices from the 1st Overlook. Going back to the first we took the iconic pics that make it look like your on the edge of a cliff, ate lunch with Oblivious and took some more poses  with packs on this time. Others arrived so everyone was passing cameras and helping everyone get the money shots! So cool to see people helping each other and insuring all are taken care of.  One can see Tinker Cliffs from the Knob, so Recon and I headed on.  It seemed to take a while to get there but there were a couple of neat boulder formations that we took some pictures at, while also dodging some wind and rain, although both cooled our bodies nicely. I joked that I had don’t my part by using my Pack Cover and finally Recon relented and put his on.  However, when we hit the top and the beginning of Tinker Cliffs, on cue the clouds and rain moved on and we were left with a glorious sight!  McAfee Knob gets all the attention but I found more glory in the Cliffs.  You just hike along and stepped onto an outcropping, then hike along and another and another for quite a distance and a lot of pictures.  Beautiful and simply Glorious!  Soon we were almost overwhelmed and started down just at that point.  We met a 2017 SOBO from Roanoke named 
Scuba Steve, who had finished in November but was out here enjoying his “backyard”. He said that the McAfee Trail Head Parking was such a hassle and agreed that he loves the Cliffs maybe a little more!  He gave us three sweat oranges as magic; we each ate one and split the third at dinner later.  Once downhill we found the Shelter and went .1 for the campground but didn’t like the site.  Recon said, let’s go a little further and while at first I was hesitant; I remembers the Ridge Runner saying to go past the first camp and then look for the Bear Box.  Almost on command, Recon spotted the area!  A great spot with a fire pit, picnic table and Bear Box!  While setting up my Hammock, I didn’t check clouds and didn’t start with the Tarp.  As if insuring that I knew God was in control; it started to rain!  Not much, and it quickly stopped when the Tarp was deployed but not staked; as if God was toying with me.  Recon started a fire, the first for us and we ate dinner at the table with two German Hikers we have played leap frogged since the Smokies.  My CNOC water bladder has a pin hole leak on a side fold seem that I discovered and had to slow with my finger.  I applied some Tenacious Tape that Recon let me have to try and seal it.  He said it worked for a bladder of his so we shall see. Turned on Cell and immediately got a text from Joanie, asking me what I was thinking sitting out on an edge like that today!  Although she was glad I was safe!  Someone must have Narced on me and sent her the Face Book Post!  I assured her it’s and optical delusion and I was totally fine. Which wasn’t lying. Oh that reminds me, we also met three lady hikers today that asked if we were Thru Hikers?  So cool to be stopped by other informed Day and Section hikers.  They asked if we were Trail journaling and I gave them this account. I also shared the info I had from Which Way and Next Step that we had just encountered at Four Pines.  So I hope you Ladies enjoy your shout out.  On clue, it’s bed time and some minor rain showers are going to pass over us, which is fine because we have Rejoiced many times today!","Four Pines Hoste 703.4

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589477,"The day started comfortably as Tank and Tag, Hip Cat, and Oblivious walked by and praised the site, wishing they hadn’t stopped short.  Everyone was anxious to get to Daleville for a hotel and a Nero.    We weren’t to far behind and left at 7:15 passing two of the four before town.  The climb was long and took awhile as we looped back south on the mountain range opposite of Tinker Cliffs, with a Lake to our right where yesterday it was to our left.  We looped all the way back to view Roanoke VA; as well as being able to see McKafee Knob range from the opposite direction.  Then when we could go no further, we started down and back to our right to head to Daleville.  We hit the bottom level pretty quickly and then it was through pastures with cows munching away; over big logs, a Railroad track and then out on a super busy road.  While trying to get a sense of direction, Along came Tank and Tag a Long from the HoJo.  We simply fell in step with them, as we were all headed to the Outfitter Store.    Once there I searched for convertible pants.  Shooting some great Ex Officio’s on clearance, I was ecstatic and then disappointed, realizing they were women’s.  I asked if they had anything like this in the men’s and was told no but asked what size I was.  If the last scaled were correct I am currently 160 and have lost 30 pounds.  I was a 37 waist and now think I probably am a 32 and maybe below that.   A girl Clerk converted that for me and told me to try the women’s size if I wanted.  So I did!  They fit and this means I am down four dress sizes!  I asked Recon if my Butt looked big in them and he assured me that I looked fabulous.  (Of course I made that up, Man Rules never allow one man to ask another to check out his Butt!). The pants work so now I have to just get use to the waist button being on the wrong side.  I then purchased new Green Feet Insoles for the Altra Lone Peaks, although they are not Green or Orange but a Hybrid of softness that I was looking for.  I wore them out of the store and the rest of the day and my feet are not aching as much!  I also purchase Injinjii Liners because my toes are blistering between each other.  I also wore those out of the store!  I left everyone else and ran to a nearby Super Cuts and got a hair cut and beard trimmed and shaped.  Now I am a cleaner cut homeless looking guy!  It cost me $25 bucks though!  I am bald on the back of my head so I think the beard should cover that loss of hair.  But they didn’t see it that way so I didn’t argue.  Then to Kroger’s for a resupply to get us to Glasgow VA.  I had some strange stuff to get, like chewable Vitamins, ibuprofen,  and lots of snake bars!  By the time I was finished, I had doubled t he usual weekly Resupply on top of the Sixty I spent two days ago in Catawba.  Luckily I got so bonus from using my (well Joanie’s ) Kroger Card.  I also got my one and only Cherry Coke!  Then it was over two Wendy’s for a $15 dollar Lunch of Taco Salad (with two Sour Creams and Salsa!), Single with Cheese, Fries and two Large Frosty’s (one was for Recon). Hiker Hunger has hit and everyone is struggling with keeping up the calorie count! The only thing I didn’t get was my glasses tightened! Oh well.  Then we were off to hike one mile and take advantage of a free camp spot and showers in a Fire House in Troutville VA. However, once we were at the road and looking at a map of the town, we debated 1.6 into town (non AT Miles) or 3.6 to a Shelter with Water.  The day being nice and the time being only a little before three,  we hiked on.  It was a long climb up but graded well.  We turned off for the shelter, just in time. Afternoon Thunderstorms were all around us.  We checked weather and set up in the shelter not wanting to risk packing wet tents and tarps in the morning. It really never rained on us, and we enjoyed cooking g dinner as the temperature was cooled by the storms raining in the open valleys.  It seems like we will pull ahead of others slightly and hopefully avoid the bubble.  It worked tonight, we have the shelter to ourselves and saved money by not sleeping in town and taking advantage of decent weather because it hasn’t and won’t always decent and we may need to bail due to weather up the trail.  It was a day that much was accomplished.","Lambert Meadow Campground 720.0

Up at 5:30 but Slow start; not use to packing up in shelter.  It was still a smart move because it did rain most of the night.  Nice “ting” on the tin roof to sleep to.  Nice that it stopped this morning too.  Hiking was uneventful and smooth all morning.  I forgot to mention that the Outfitter changed out my bent Trekking poles so now it well collapse. They are Black instead of silver, but that makes it easy to tell left from right.  At around 11:15 we ended up at a road with a new type of AT sign and mile marker that read 97.  This is the Blue Ridge Parkway and the AT bounces back and forth across it for 100 Miles, back down to a post that will read 0.  Almost  immediately,  there were vistas that offered a vehicle pull off on one side but a view on both sides.  This made hiking very enjoyable as well as giving us fairly smooth trail.  We ate lunch at a concrete picnic table at one of the views and watched the rain off in the valley.  The good Lord kept the rain away, until we were done and had pack covers on.  A gentle rAin the. Fell for the next hour or so.  This kept the temps cool, brought out birds. This little Spring shower brought out out May flowers. All different varieties sand colors on both sides of the trail. In the later afternoon we past a tall shrub that reminded me of a Crab Apple and the fragrance alone was inspiring.  We had to pull off at a Shelter at 2:00 to get water for the next 8 miles.  The shelter we had planned out is a dry shelter. At the next Vista we talked with a man, only to find out that this was Terry, Tanks Brother in Law.  He stated that he was supporting Tank and Tag a Long, as they slack packed.    When we left we told him to joke about meeting real hikers with regular backpacks!  At the next road crossing, which had water that wasn’t listed on Guthooks, Recon was topping off his supply and here came Tank and Tag.  They were really moving and said they were trying to get 28 miles today and both were sorting their new hiking shoes from yesterday!  Tag said that the Altra’s saved his feet but he loved the sole of these new Merril Moab Lows.  I have found the same thing and while the new Green Feet helped some today, they still ache.  I think the Merrill’s could be my next pair to handle the rocks of Pa.  Our last 3.4 was slow and rugged. It felt like I was on empty.  Always a good sight when the Shelter comes in view.  The hammock went up quickly, dinner finished, and a quick .1 to what is called Buchanan’s View.  A rock outcropping facing west for the Sunset. It was beautiful, but a rain cloud in the distance kept it from being spectacular.  The Trail gives you what it gives you!","Fullhardt Knob Shelter

Then downhill to a road crossing and a very pleasant surprise!  I thought I had missed my chance for Pepsi yesterday, but as I crossed the road, here was Tanks Brother in Law - Terry!  He recognized me and soon I was having a cup of Pepsi, followed by a cup of Sprite. Then Recon and I both enjoyed a Banana before Terry topped off our water bottles from a jug of water.  A big shout out to Terry and I take back all the jokes about Tank and Tag (fingers crossed behind my back, lol). Actually, Terry is an important part to the plan.  Tank and Tag only planned to hike halfway and have to be in Harper’s Ferry by May 20th. They can just make it with some bigger miles that can’t be done with full packs. Terry’s support makes all the difference plus he is now a part of the 2018 AT story.  The sad part is that all three will pull way ahead of us and we may not see them again. Sad to meet and then not see great people on the trail; but that is the trail.  I was feeling wonderful with caffeine pop in my system!  Recon took some Vitamin I so his feet were doing a little better and he hiked easier as well.  I was leading until we came down from a point called Petites Gap and along a slanting ridge. I was moving along, and as I put my left pole down, I saw and heard a Black stick rattle!  I have heard that
Sound before, last time at Tar Hollow State Park. It instantly causes one to step back quickly.  Recon came up and I showed him.  He actually saw the full snake better than I, until I put on my glasses.  He photo and filmed it for both of us.  It was a beautiful Timber Rattler.  However, as it crawled forward and we stepped forward, we both heard a second rattle off to our right.  Once again, we backed quickly!  Never saw it, but heard it as it moved uphill.  I am pretty sure it had caught something and wanted it worse than us!  After a few minutes we had enough and started beating the leaves to the right of the trail as we slowly moved past the rattler on the left.  Then we were on our way with faster heart rates.  Recon set up our shuttle and bunk in Glasgow for a 3:00 Pick up. We were on a down hill path towards the James River.  When we moved away slightly, we ended up at the last shelter and stopped for lunch.  We then got back on trail and knew we would beat that time so we reset it for 2:00 before we lost signal.  Soon we were walking right along the side of the river and saw a train trestle that should be were the foot bridge is.  As we got closer, we saw that the Trestle was actually behind the footbridge.  We looped around and came back up to the longest footbridge on the AT, spanning 1,000 feet.  It
Is impressive!  However, a bolt of lightning up stream had us moving quickly across the water.  It also ruined any thought of the tradition of jumping from the bridge into the James below!  Highly unlikely for us grown men, anyway. No sooner had we gotten off the bridge, across the railroad tracks and out to the parking lot; when the shuttle pulled up!  Not a minute too soon either; for once in the car, it started to pour!  It was 1:40 and luckily the shuttle was ahead of schedule like us!  Quick trip to the Glasgow Post Office for Recons Packages and then on to the Hostel.  It is really a nice set up; actually a house with washroom, Kitchen area, living room, bathroom and two bedrooms with bunk beds!  Awesome place to Nero and Resupply. Also, great to be out of the rain for the night.  Tomorrow will be a later start because both of us are mailing a few unneeded items home to lighten our weight.  For me it’s Hiking Pants that are too big, Rain Pants now that it’s warm and I have switched to the kilt, wristies, and the Thermometer.  I am hanging onto the gloves, hat and balaclava stored on the very bottom of the pack.  Not worth the hassle of sending them home and figuring how to get them back before the White Mountains.  Can decide down the trail if I really think the weight is that big of a deal. For now, my system is working well and I am moving right along!  Oh, maybe the biggest highlight of the day is Glasgow’s Fiberglass Dinosaur!  You don’t see that every day!  Reminded me of the strange sight along Route 66 when I was five or six!","Thunder Hill Shelter

That’s always a great start, but this allowed me to send a Mother’s Day Video Card to Joanie! Low and behold she was up and responded!  Extra bonus to text with her!  Then I really started putting the legs to the climb that led me to a side trail for Spy Rock.  Luckily Recon was on his way back and told me leave my pack and poles; as well as which path had the least Rock Scramble!  The view was worth the effort and became the highlight of the day.  Then it was catch up with Recon for Lunch at the the Priest Shelter.  He had already eaten in order to keep on his schedule. At first I was going to hold off for another half an hour but decided against waiting. Back at the Junction between the AT and Shelter, I had checked Guthooks to see that it was .1 to the Shelter.  Then I continued to walk .3 up the AT before God said, “Hey Stupid, you are heading North and skipping the shelter!”.  I hate backtracking and was stumbling and slow too boot!  Signs I needed a break. I read the journal log and for once signed it as part of the trail experience.  The practice is to make a trail confession and record it in the Priest Shelter Log; Which is exactly what I did.  Can’t state my sin, lol, because I think it’s like birthday candle wishes! It was then time to finish the climb that ends on a beautiful rock outcropping, or so I’ve heard. I was .9 miles past it when I realized I should have taken that side trail to the left!  No worries, I was told the view was kind of hazy and I had a clear view at Spy Rock.  The trail gives what it gives, and I have been blessed with weather, views, and Hostel stops!  A short way down, I had an excellent view of the valley on the east side of the mountain.  The east side also blocked the sun and was much cooler than when we rounded and headed west and northwest!  The rest of the day was spent in small ups and downs until the final up from a road to get to Harpers Creek Shelter.  The last two miles were exhausting in the heat of the day.  Once we hit the shelter, Recon decided not to set up camp and to sleep there.  I debated the hammock but thinking it would just be two of us, I started hanging damp cloths and pulling out the Pad.  This was done in conjunction with cooking dinner.  Before we were finished, two more South bounders stopped for the night, as well as two Northbound Section Hikers. The section hikers got water and decided to continue on but we are now four across in the shelter.  No biggie, it holds six.  I just hope they don’t get made when Recon wakes at 4:00 and I start stirring at 5 a.m.!  I did get a chance to soak and clean off in the stream, which makes the evening time, much nicer!  So all in all, I must confess that this was a great Sunday!","Piney River North Fork

It just seems to flow and I am a better person and hiker with his friendship.  We must really blend because people actually think we are brothers and that we started the trail together (not 100 miles into the hike). Recon just laughs; but to have him as a trail brother has really helped keep the Virginia Blues away.  Like most mornings, we started with a major climb and the. Have another one or two later in the day, as we usually finish at lower elevation when the heat and miles have taken their toll.  Almost immediately, the rocks where jutting out here and there.  A very unstable path.  I stepped and slipped into a crevasse, thinking that this could have easily ended in a broken ankle or lower leg.  I was already taking my time and trying to concentrate so only one thing left to do... Pray.  So I did.  Now I may be crazy and I would usually say that God has more important things to do than hear me ask for anything that has to do with hiking this trail.  I also battle with what I should be able to handle versus what to let go and let God.  But after that sermon, I just prayed to be kept safe and shown the way.  It was amazing, as if the rocks vibrated, or lightened up, or just caught my eye!  I don’t know. Suddenly, I knew which rock was the one to step on, then the next and the next.  It was as if I could glide from rock to rock as they signaled to me. I thought of bible passages that speak to lighting a path, and showing the way.  In many ways, this became more about life than just hiking across rocks.  The nice thing about rocky accents is that they often lead to views.  Today we had a ton of them. Each slightly different than the one before and while none as grand as Spy Rock yesterday, each was a welcomed blessing that we took some time to enjoy.  Late in the day, however, we got to the point that we were “viewed out”.  Can you imagine so many views that you are overwhelmed and really can’t take in another! Yet, as the afternoon pushed on, we found ourselves surrounded by Thunderstorm Cells.  At one point we put on the pack covers and sat for awhile, to let the storms slide by to our North and East.  Our final climb was over Hump Mountain and to a piped spring for water .2 miles before a camp site.  We hit the camp just minutes before a Thunderstorm finally passed directly over us.  But my friend Jesus held it off long enough to get the tarp and even the hammock hung before it let loose.  My friend Recon was there asking if I needed to store my pack in his tent or if he could do anything to help; as he had rush to camp while I filtered water.  All was good and dinner was prepared indoor so to speak.  A real gully washer for sure.  When it finally past we were able to hang our food because there are signs saying that the bears are active in this area.  Maybe that storm will keep them away and they won’t cross our path!

Nice to see it being treated with respect although the stones are unreadable.  A little further up the trail was the remnants of an old chimney and foundation that

We took a few pics of the Blue Ridge Parkway (that we just hiked) to the south and Skyline Drive to the North leading to the Shenandoah’s to be hiked over the next six days.  We called the hostel shuttle and stayed in the shade to wait.  Soon it arrived and Stanimal (the owner) himself took us into Waynesville.  We talked about how much we enjoyed his hostel at Glascow and he assured us that this place was great also!  It is, and although we said bunks, he gave us a room with two beds and a small couch, when Recon said that we needed to Zero here tomorrow as well!  Next came the laundry, shower, and lunch.

The trail Angel (Dubros) that drove us, had us put the shopping  bags in our room at Stanimals and then transported us to Rockfish Outfitters.  My Altra Lone peaks have maybe 50 miles left, but that won’t last the week. Just not durable enough. Heel tread is gone and big toe is busting out on both sides.  Went in thinking Merril Moab Low Ventilators (and they were cheaper) but asked about the Salomon XA Pro 3D. The Outfitter said that the Salomon is a stiffer footbox and a foot plate for rocks (exactly what I am thinking for Pa). However, he brought out two sizes for each type and said the best shoe is the most comfortable one!  The Salomon won and was even more improved when he said to put the Green Feet insoles in first and the.

Makes for a slow first day on the trail.  Repacked the backpack.  Took a second shower, just for enjoyment and to rinse off after shaving my neck (but not the beard). Continued downloading vids to You Tube, but going to be an ongoing process.  Doing a lot of sitting on this day as well.  I really enjoy the Hostel life, if you don’t mind other hikers and not much privacy.  Yet, it really is part of the trail experience! Stanimals is probably the nicest using houses as hostels.  Woods Hole is great because of the ambiance.  Woods Hole is $20 per night while Stanimals is $30.  So much cheaper than a hotel room, so getting use to working around others.  Staying on dinner schedule for 6 pm and once again Recon Cooks and I clean.  Pre cooked chicken, Avocado, Sweat Potato, and Spinach with onion, zucchini, summer squash and topped with basil!  Fresh Veggies are gourmet when use to Ramon on the trail!  Feeling halfway human again and ready to hike tomorrow.  We get to start the Shenandoah’s but rain is going to be a constant factor for the 6 days it will take to get to Front Royal.  Just have to keep the Faith and keep hiking north. Forgot to mention that yesterday was May 15th and I started March 15th,  somehow it is not as significant as what and where I currently am.  However, Praise God that I am exactly where he has placed me!",,Waynesboro ,"May 16, Wed",0

I met up with Hipcat and hiked with him because he has car camped and hiked in the SNP before.  It was great talking with him because he is a retired educator from the Chesapeake School System.  We hiked to the Loft Mountain Camp Store which was to be the highlight of the day.  Ordered Large Coffee with one free refill, a Pepsi, Hostess Cupcakes and a bag of M&M’s.  Sitting on benches outside while I spent 25 cents for 10 Minutes on the dryer to dry hiking clothes.  I probably ended up spending $1.75 but dry socks, boxers, pants and shirt was worth it.  The rest of the morning was more enjoyable in the fog and dripping raindrops from the trees.  We hit Pinefield Hut slightly before 2pm and Recon was their having just finished Lunch.  HipCat decided to stay dry and stop short at this Hut leaving a 20 for tomorrow in possibly better weather.  I decided to head with Recon, hoping to get to the further shelter;  hoping to avoid some of the pitfalls from the night before and get some distance between us and others.  It didn’t work.  Once we past the 900 mile mark (45 minutes earlier than the week before’s time to pass 800 miles); it started to rain hard.  We hiked the last 5.1 Miles getting soaked just like the previous day.  The shelter already had five people in it, two from last night, so our plan may have not worked.  More showed as we ate dinner and so we are at capacity. One is having to set up a hammock in the rain.  But I am down low and better situated than last night, so I am set.  Still surprised that more didn’t head to Trail Days in Damascus and as always; the shelters are crowded in inclement weather.  Still, passing 900 is nice and total Miles was over 21 on much smoother trail.  However, it’s never easy!  So we hope for a better day tomorrow and pray the weather breaks to allow camping Saturday night and a partly cloudy Sunday.

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591115,"Rain has been constant enough to turn the trail into a flowing rivers on up and downhills with 1-3 inch puddles on the straight away’s. It becomes futile to avoid them by stepping on the  sides because soon you are sunk into 4 inch muck!  After awhile, you just surrender and plow through.  Suddenly, your feet feel drier from hiking heat, so you repeat the futile trail hopping until you plow through again.  At one point Recon started doing trail maintenance by moving leaves and mud to open up the flow off the trail.  I joined for awhile hoping those behind us would appreciated a slightly dryer trail; but that also became futile.  We tried to act like little boys and enjoy splashing through the mud puddles, but after awhile we went back to acting our age.  Nothing seemed to make the miles go quicker.  Finally, I listened to a Mighty Blue Podcast and he was interviewing Disciple from last years AT season.  It is a great story of listening to God and trusting him for every need.  I could relate because my trip has taught me a great deal about Faith.  Of course you grow stronger in faith when facing adversity such as rain. I tried to concentrate on God alone as we hiked the last long four miles to the Big Meadow Wayside; but a burger and blackberry shake where also heavy on my mind!  God took care of that for me; the wayside and most of Sky Line Drive is closed due to a power outage for days now.  We hiked another .7 to the camp registration booth and purchased a campsite for $10 a piece.  At least it’s not a Shelter and the power was restored so we did laundry and took a five minute shower for $1.75. I am still  suffering from trench feet and they are very sore and throbbing.  Hoping that the hammock will let them dry as I hopefully sleep better tonight.  At least we aren’t in the shelter and are sleeping in before hitting the wayside in the morning, God Willing!","HighTop Hut

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591200,"We slept in and took our time breaking camp in order to be at the Wayside when it opened, now that power had been restored.  7:30 we are hiking back the one mile to get there for the 8:00 opening, arriving at 7:50 to read a sign that read, “Due to power issue, we will open at noon”. Instantly, our mood dropped.  Even seeing a deer and tiny fawn didn’t brighten us, nor did the first view in days.  Our ungratefulness probably cost us because we didn’t turn at the first road but instead back tract to the second gravel road that led to the cemetery from the night before.  That meant we rehiked 1.7 Miles again to get to the point we left the AT last night!  You know I hate backtracking and wasted miles that don’t count.  No choice, I put in ear buds and started to listen to a sermon.  Once again, it spoke to me. It said to rejoice in times of trial because this brings a more joyful time of rejoicing when blessings do come.  For example, Marriage Vowels (For Better or Worse, in sickness and in health) are said by every couple; but true love and the Joyful Rejoicing of that love occurs after the couple has been tested by illness or bad times and they work through it together.  My attitude started to brighten as I though about the trials of the trail the past three days.  I slowly started to have some Joy with a great Overlook and cell service to text home.  Then more joy at another outcropping when Recon was talking to his wife and I moved to a second outcropping just a little further to call mine!  Although she was exhausted and my feet were raw, it was still great to tell her how much I miss and love her. Then I posted the last three days to the journal and checked into Facebook.  It was the. That I realized, if not for retiring and hiking the AT, I would be calling names out for the High School Graduation Ceremony; a time of stress but joy in the past.  This would have been a trial time for me, if I weren’t on the trail.  So instead, I joyfully rejoiced for those there and for me here hiking.  Before you know it, I thought I was following Recon and he thought he was following me, yet we both ended up meeting at the SkyLand Restaurant and Gift Shop.  A Soda Pop always is cause for joy.  A relaxing sandwich, Orange and coffee is awesome.  Then another pop while my feet aired out made the hour and a half help our mood turn around totally.  We created a plan to only hike 15 today and have the next three days lined up.  We hit another wayside tomorrow (hopefully before rain) so I can sample the famous Blackberry Shake.  The afternoon wasn’t rushed, we chatted with people asking if we are through hiking.  One couple had family that had given up land to form the SNP during the Roosevelt era!  We had views and perfect weather.  The trail was mostly dry and once again we were able to step around the puddles that occasionally where present.  We hit the Hut and had dinner with two Canadian women (who have been traveling the same rain soaked path we have been), a Spaniard, a SOBO Section Hiker and HipCat caught up with us again. They are staying in the shelter while we are taking advantage of the weather and camping out.  My bear count is still 0, but the Spaniard saw one while getting water, I just saw the bear scat!  I really don’t care about seeing one myself; although I love hiking with Recon because he sees everything.  Today he was within 15 feet of deer, talked to a chipmunk while he took its picture, and filmed another Scarlet Tanager that was relatively close and tweeting it’s song.   All in all, plenty of reasons to Joyfully Rejoice!","Big Meadows CampGround

I finally got a Blackberry Milkshake that the Waysides are known for; and it was a great tasting creamy smooth drink!  We also caught up to Jinx, Gypsy, Kenya and Gravity.  They are more card players that hike!  The afternoon was quick miles and we were to the Hut by 3 in the afternoon.  Everyone at the wayside is now in the shelter.  Although it’s kind of sad because HipCat is racing ahead to Harpers Ferry to get off Trail with his wife.  (May catch him up trail later) Recon and I chose camping over the Hut, figuring that if it rains, we are in a Hostel and Resupplying in Front Royal VA Tomorrow early afternoon.

What else should we have expected?  Once again the trail was a running river but I was able to side step and keep my feet mostly dry. Finally hitting the North Sign in Permit Box lets us know we were done, as well as the trail suddenly becoming a rock bed (instead of the smooth trail we had become use to.  Hats off to the Potomac Trail Club) and the Sun Suddenly started to break through.  On the way down, I got to hike a little with a lady named Jayne - Trail Name “Revisit” because she revisits sections of the AT that she has hiked before.  More importantly she is a member of the Georgia Appalachian Trail Club that maintains the beginning of the trail at Springer.  She talked about how much work has been done since the “Walk in the Woods” movie.  I talked about how great the start was and also how Trail maintainers worked hard to make sure trees don’t block the trail.  We parted ways at the 4H center that was .4 off the trail and to fair for me to chance; even for a Soda Pop!  I continued on downhill and almost had my first stream crossing.  I debated taking off shoes and socks but decided against it, due to just a few more miles until Shower and laundry time.  I also say almost because even though the water was flowing over the rocks used to step on, my left foot only got slightly wet from one deeper rock.  Finally, I arrived at Mountain Home Cabin, run by 2012  Thru Hikers.  Scott “Possible” is a great host and talk of the history of the Nationally Registered Site, including a passage from a teenage girl during the Civil War!  Super interesting.  He shuttled us to Spelunkers for a Burger Fries Coke Combo and a Custard Chocolate Shake!  Then to McDonald’s for a coffee and a cone.  Finally to a grocery store called Martin’s for our 5 day Resupply and Diner for tonight.  Again, the weekly grocery bill is getting larger but mainly because of protein bars that I desperately need to hike each day.  The rest of the afternoon and evening was spent packaging the food to get it as compact as possible. The trash compactor bag leaked in the bottom of the pack, so Scott was nice enough to get me a large thick bag to replace it with.  Should be good to go (in the rain) now.  Having more ice cream tonight and then off to bed.  Not a bad Nero at all.  Next up is Harpers Ferry.","Gravel Springs Hut

Great trail and wonderful park!  The park ends at Ashby Gap, where you have to play “Frogger” to cross US 17/50; a busy divided highway. At my age and with a pack on my back; this was more dangerous than a bear in the woods!  Next up was the south entrance to the Roller Coaster, the name given to a 14 mile section of steep climbs and descents.  Everyone makes “clicking” noises as the first climb starts and then screams and raise arms on the first descent.  Yes I looked and sounded crazy, but it lightened the days Hike!  After that, it’s pretty much back to hiking. There was one view for the day and we still have 5.2 miles of the coaster to finish.  Also passed the 1,000 mile mark a day early and without to much fan fair.  Everyone is holding to get to Pa. and the official halfway point, it seems.

Maybe a volunteer Fire Department; but we heard no sirens afterwards.  So I was awake and remembering that we had over 5 miles of the Roller Coaster to finish; in reality we in started in Animal Kingdom.  A dear casually strolled by on its way to get water.  It reminded me of the Bible reference to Lions laying with Lambs.  This deer was less than ten feet from us and paid us no attention what so ever!  Just a beautiful, graceful creature.  We saw another later in the day that actually circled around us to investigate, before bolting down hill. I then saw a Pileated “Woody” Woodpecker, my second favorite bird behind the Cardinal (what can o say; I grew up on St. Louis). This bird was at ground level eating ants from a stump.  Two toads missed being impaled by my Trekking poles, luckily!  Then the hiking got serious.  We passed Bears Den Hostel Which is a stone mansion built in 1933 for the Wealthy Washingtonians. It was turned into a hostel in 1986 and we would have stayed if the weather wasn’t so nice and camping so enjoyable. Just before rush hour, I crossed Va. Route 7, again quite scary with vehicles going 70 compared to my 2!  However, I did chuckle remembering Recon’s wife laughing at our crossing yesterday and saying that we probably looked like two turtles crossing the road with our packs as our shells!  If she didn’t paint such an accurate picture, I would have been insulted!  The end of the Roller Coaster was bumpy, rocky, and more work than the start!  However, it did come to an end. Kenyon (from Great Britain) asked if I would like to go again, because there was no one in line!  I assured him, I did not!  I had a view of a wonderful (I am sure a Multi Million Dollar) Mansion on the far side of the mountain ridge. No other home I. Sight and the view opened to my right for miles!  What a location!  Then it was simply miles before lunch, as the trail got easier.  I missed the State Line even though it is a sign on a post!  I guess head down and pushing forward. That means 4 down and 10 to go; with the next two being short mileage states.  I did sing “Country Road” but replaces a part with take me to Katahdin - where I belong!  Finally stopped for lunch at a shelter and out of water.  Shelter had a porch swing! Nice!  But a long downhill hike with downed trees to get water; not so nice!  Then off to our mid afternoon stop, .3 miles off the trail at Sweet Springs Store and Gas Station. Sort of a downer because of no soft serve ice cream and we had to buy a gallon of water because they had no hose to fill bottles.  Still better than lugging two liters five miles from the down hill water supply!  Of course I got a pop and we bought Chicken Dinners for camp tonight.  We are staying at what is called “4 - Mile Camp”, because it’s four miles from Harper’s Ferry.  We will hike in early for breakfast in the morning and then to the ATC Headquarters to check in for our hike!  It’s amusing to think we are closing in on the halfway mark!","Camp 1003.7

Apparently, we have been passing back and forth over the State Line since yesterday morning.  However, this morning we passed the last sign and are truly done with Virginia! The longest miles state on the AT.  Four down and 10 to go but West Virginia and Maryland are short.  We will be out of W. Va. tomorrow as soon as we cross over the Potomac leaving Harper’s Ferry.  It’s a neat little town with a lot of history but easily done in a day.  We hit town quickly and headed to a coffee shop, sitting with HipCat as he waited on his wife and we all waited for the ATC Headquarters to open at 9:00.  We all hiked back up to the building and sat outside for about 10 minutes. When it opened we all fell in line and started the process to get our picture into the 2018 Log Book.  HipCat went first so he could get out of town and I went second so I had a nice even number to remember!  I was 1047 at Amicalola; but here I was Hiker number 380.  What an awesome feeling and an enjoyable time in the building.  I picked up my CNOC Water Container replacement bag that the company had replaced without any issues what so ever.  The ATC staff was so helpful even though they were inundated with a scout group!  However, the scaled relief map of the AT trail brought us all back to the reality that we still have a long way to go.  We headed back down the blue blaze trail to get to the White Blazes, past Jefferson Rock and two Churches that date back to the 1800’s. We stopped briefly at the Harper House built but never lived in by the man the town was named after.  Hunger took over and our small group made of Kenyon, Gravity, Jinx, Gypsy and of course Recon headed up the historic district road for beer and burgers.  The place we decided on was opening at 11; five minutes away, but they allowed us in with all our packs needing a home out of the traffic pattern.  We all had Burgers and only differed on the craft beer of choice. We wished them well as they were heading out for more miles today and wanted to beat afternoon thunderstorms. Recon and I walked across the street to check into the Towns Inn Hostel.  Then it was showers, laundry, grocery list done quickly so we could tour the town.  We walked along, reading signs and looking at the demonstrations until we looped around to the Outfitter.  No Jetboil, no rubber pole tips and no Frog Togg poncho until the owner took me to the hiker box that he thought he saw one in!  It was there!  So I will give that a try over the next few rain storms.  I like the hood on the Pre Cip and the Pit Zips are good but still gets to hit.  The poncho well hopefully cover the pack better and allow more airflow underneath.  I may also try an umbrella but the ones there were too heavy!  The. Ice cream and back to the hostel for the Resupply shuttle to Walmart.  Didn’t need dinners but breakfast and lunch are necessary to get me through to Boiling Springs.  We also picked up Salads for dinner and the. Ice Cream again afterwards!  Sitting on the porch watching a train use the same path as it has since the 1800’s. The thing that really got me about the town was the number of floods!  The worst was in 1936 and most of that low end of town is no longer being used except as Historical Park Buildings.  Overall a great restorative mental day that has us ready for tomorrow.","4 - Mile Camp 1020.5

At 6:30 I told Recon that he should go on and I was planning on zeroing to get more Imodium and   sleep until my stomach eased.  He wouldn’t here of it and handed me some of his Imodium and said to call the hotel and he would split it.  At 8:00 I called but that only had King beds - no doubles.  I passed and told Recon that I was going to see how far I could get, since the prayers for a settled stomach; as well as the pills had worked.  The first 3 miles were great along the C & O Canal Towpath.  Flat and cruising along.  But then the AT separated and of course went uphill.  I had no energy and had to stop constantly.  Sweating profusely, I really tried to stay ahead of dehydration and kept sipping water and a bottle of EmergenC.   I also prayed for level trail and at the top, things did level. Recon was awesome staying behind and encouraging me along, never complaining at the constant stops to sit on a log or rock for a break.  I started to eat fruit chews as I felt my stomach ease.  Finally, we hit a spot for lunch at noon, discussed the afternoon plain since I had already made it past the first shelter and the second shelter was three miles away but getting water was going to be a hassle.  Whisper came along and it was good to see him and hear that he was headed to the same shelter Recon had picked.  We joked about saving a spot for two so we could stay out of the rain forecasted.  At lunch I ate very little and tried to go easy on my stomach.  I started eating Gatorade Sugar Drops that I had found in a hiker box.  They do seem to work so I may try them again in the future.  The next two miles went quick and we were at Gathland State Park at the Gap of South Mountain.  It was cool to see the Civil War Battle lines and the see the War Corespondents Memorial that are there.  More importantly we got water and I tried to use the restroom without success (which was a good thing).  Then a climb started for the last five miles - the worse of the day! I needed to stop, rolled both ankles on rocks,  sat at the one and only view for the day, but was rushed by the sound of thunder.  I started praying for easier trail to pick up speed as well as beating the thunderstorm to the shelter.  I really didn’t want Recon trenched, after he had been so awesome during the day. I have never been so happy to see the shelter blaze and finally the shelter!  A fairly new one that doesn’t have mice yet hopefully!  We pulled in and started setting up inside.  Recon went for water to save me the effort. So appreciated.  I ate chicken soup for dinner to go easy on my stomach.  This was all done during a good old fashion afternoon thunderstorm.  The Lord was faithful to me and moved me up the trail, smoothing it at the moment I thought I would break and keeping us dry and safe.  I plan to hit the bed early tonight to catch up on sleep from yesterday!

I walked up an inside spiral staircase to the top of the “milk bottle” shape monument but no view due to fog. Then came the highlight of the day for me, walking across I70 on a Footbridge above the fast moving vehicles.  It was special because this same highway goes past my home town and I use it regularly.  It a way for a brief moment, I was connected to home.  The other reason it is important is because as a middle school student, I remember reading the “Appalachian Trail” Sign when passing below in a car.  Maybe that planted a seed for this Adventure now!  Next was a quarter mile walk off trail to see the Annapolis Rocks, which still offered no view and wasted time on my legs and feet!  I sort of am glad because had the Sun broke through the day would have been hot and miserable.  Instead God carried me with cooler temperatures and shade from the trees.  We made great speed and stopped for lunch at 11:00, as well as the ten mile mark. By 1:30 we were close to only having five miles left in the day, so we sat a very short while at a shelter that I could have bailed at.  I didn’t and we kept going.  The last five included rocks, a water stop (east of the Antietam Battle Field, and a final climb uphill that took everyone’s last bit of strength to climb. But we made it to the shelter, although we are camping outside of it.  Recon has to get an early start to do 23 miles in order to meet his wife for some zero days.  I am heading on without this valued friend but hopeful that we will rejoin long before Vermont.  He has been nothing but supportive and encouraging, especially the last two difficult days!  Just a cool guy to have as a trail brother.  Once again though, I will have to trust God to carry me through the day!","Rocky Run Shelter

For the first time, hiking was not fun and thoughts of dropping ran through my head.  However, the only bail point was Waynesboro and the cost would have been over $100.  To rich for my blood, so I planned to quickly reach PenMar Park, hoping to get a Soda!  When I arrived an older gentleman that hiked the trail in the 70’s, gave me the low down on the park and Waynesboro Pa as well.  Bad news, the pop machine was taken out two years ago!  So I grabbed water (that didn’t have to be filtered and I was on my way. Next was the Mason Dixon Line (Maryland / Pensilvania State Line) but I really didn’t celebrate, just hiked on. Next I came to a shelter that I wasn’t planning on stopping at, but since it was 11:30, I thought I should try.  Was ready to try dinner for lunch, but thought I should go light on my stomach. Then I was off again.  Stopped at Old Forge Park for some portable water (cold too) and also dropped my trash in the cab provided (the little pleasures in life).  Finally I hit Tumbling Run Shelters; two of them.  One for snorers and one for quiet sleepers. I climbed in to the snorers and took a half hour nap from 1:30 to 2:00. I debated staying and probably should have.  Instead I thought the 6.6 miles would be nothing in the afternoon and would get me more on schedule for Boiling Springs on Friday. So off I went and all was good until, fall number five. Skipped on a rock, landed on my butt and bent the Rt Trekking pole, again!  No brain damage though, the pack saved me.  Everything finally cumulated the last mile.  I sputtered and rested and walked and stopped...  Finally arrived a little after five and totally spent.  Still struggled to set up hammock, get water (.5 round drop with a downhill) and cook some dinner. Was trying to get some soup into me but my stomach wouldn’t have it... up it came, about three for four heaves!  Luckily everyone else was gone from the table!  Funny though, I do feel better now!  Not to be gross but it was mainly water, Gatorade and what little soup I had forced down. Stomach is still gurgling but I feel much better laying in my hammock.  Tomorrow I think, will only be a 13 miler to a shelter for rain the next two days. Have to plan out the rest of the week but hopefully I am still on track for arriving in Boiling Springs.   Just have to wait and see and truly trust the Lord!  Normally, I could have done 27 miles on this trail; easier than the TVT! Lack of energy though is really setting me back and causing me to question continuing.  Yet I am glad for Recon, I would imagine he did the 23 miles easily and with time to spare to meet his wife for the next five days!  He was of and gone by 3:30 or 4, so I would say he was excited to see her!  Praying they enjoy the time together.","Raven Rock Shelter

My plan was to get to US Route 30 and hike 1/2 mile West to Timber’s Restaurant that had great reviews on Guthooks and seemed to be hiker friendly.  Only a three mile hike but it took me an hour and a half to do what should have been done in an hour.  The place was awesome.  The wife (one of the owners - their married) had the same name as my mom - “Wanda”. It was either a great sign or my mom was going to have some fun with me!  Luckily, it was a great sign.  I was slow on ordering, lethargic, and still not sure how the day was going to turn out.  When asked what meat I would like with my eggs and fried potatoes, I asked, “Is the meat one like hamburger? to go along with the regular bacon and sausage?”  She looked at me and should have laughed in my face but seemed to understand I wasn’t all there!  She simply gave me the simple three choices of bacon, sausage or ham.  PS I chose bacon and also added two pancakes.  Coffee tasted great! Lots of refills with cream and plenty of sugar.  Some ice water as well.  Couldn’t finish the last of the pancake but did well. I sat longer to let it all take effect and then ordered a Pepsi. Couldn’t even drink half of it; so that sealed the deal.  I headed .8 down the road to the Trail of Hope Hostel.  Whisperer greeted me so I knew this was a great omen!  He was Zeroing here. Showered, did laundry, and the took a couple hour nap and really just rested all day.  They provided a dinner at the Trail of Hope Church next door, followed by a bible study.  Stomach is still queasy, but at least I am eating and holding it down.  They also provided a bag of pretzels which is actually quite tasty and soothing.  However, close to bed time (8:00 pm), so I am off to bed.  Tomorrow’s plan is breakfast at Timber’s and 14 miles to another hostel for the night or turn back and stay here for a true zero.  Only God knows and will let my stomach decide.  Really trying to Keep the Faith and Keep HikN^.","Rocky Mountain Shelter

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592502,"The night was a difficult one, back to stomach issues which I thought I was over.  I was wrong!  But I had prayed about options of no hiking, hiking shorter miles but worried about rain adding to my agony and in the back of my mind was slack packing (sorry Recon, desperate times call for desperate measures.  Lol). I slept till 6:15 and tried to get to 6:30 or 7 but couldn’t. So I got up, made a pot of coffee and really had no idea what the day was going to bring.  Suddenly, the entire hostel was downstairs and all waiting on a shuttle for a twenty mile slack pack day.  However, Mellissa (a flip flopper that just started in Harper’s Ferry less than a week ago) really only wanted to push an 11 mile slack. Suddenly, I was included with her, with Whispers encouragement.  We were all handed little Green School Packs and loaded some very basic items such as water, snacks and rain gear (toiletry bag for me!)into them.  Much, much lighter than my full pack!  At 7:30 we were off and at 8:00 a.m. I was headed southbound with Mel.  It was different but very positive in a way.  I came across NOBO friends that I haven’t seen in Miles!  First was Easy Pete who had offered to do the One Gallon Ice Cream Challenge to put weight on me!  However, he also has his tough schedule to keep.  He is leaving the trail for his Mother In Laws memorial service in a short while. I am keeping him in my thoughts and prayers.  My Mother In Law is just mom to me.  Although she still claims I am her favorite Son in Law (the only one she has, lol). Next came Amber and Paul raving about the new Privy at their shelter!  Luckily, I didn’t need one but still warned them to sanitize their hands when I left.  Saw Repeat with temporary sandles from Waynesboro Pa. to get him to his mail drop in Boiling Springs.  Saw the two Germans again and apparently Quarters is suffering from similar symptoms since Harper’s Ferry as well!  Glad I was heading South!  Saw Gypsy and his friends slowly increasing Miles. After that, was a wonderful rate of hiking and hearing Mel’s story.  She is slightly older than my daughter’s age, so I felt a fatherly type of connection.  When we completed the 11 miles, it was just the right amount!  Headed straight to Timber’s and ordered breakfast while paying for Mellissa’s Lunch.  The Chocolate milk was the bomb!  Mel picked up the tip and we were off to the hostel.  I was hoping to beat the rain, so I rented a bike for a buck and ride 4 miles to a Rite Aid and then stopped at a Dollar General on the way back.  I replaced all my water-bottles to start fresh tomorrow, along with a bottle of Gatorade.  I just beat the rain back to the hostel, so God is still with me!  I then Clorox Bleached my tubing and mouthpiece. Repackaged my food and then took a shower for the day.  Dinner was next and Mel had cooked up some Mac n Cheese and I added a turkey hotdog to the gourmet meal!  Followed up with Watermelon and a Cherry Coke!  I may just make it!  Still on the mends but tomorrow I can take a long break in the afternoon at Pine Grove Furnace and maybe do the Ice Cream Challenge it
Is known for; but I am not pushing this stomach!  I only have 22 miles total to meet Joanie on Saturday early afternoon if I am lucky and God is willing it!  Keeping the Faith!","US 30 Trail of Hope Hostel

I also passed another hundred miles this week when I passed 1100 miles (again not marked or I missed it). It was wonderful because we were shuttled back to the road crossing we hiked south from yesterday, to walk north today. Bob was smart though, and had suggested taking out packs on to Pine Grove Furnace that we pass directly through.  So Mel and I hiked the first 8.9 Miles pack free!  Just as planned, we walked up to the Pine Grove General Store and there they were on the bench. We stopped for two hours here. One hour to eat and one hour in the AT Museum. I meet up with HipCat while he was eating his gallon of ice cream for the Half Gallon Challenge!  He was successful.  I passed up the challenge, due to this weeks stomach issues, although I could have used the calories.  I did eat a small cup of ice cream to top off lunch.  I also am enjoying chocolate milk rather than Coke that gives me the belches.  HipCat shared that he suffered stomach issues for two weeks back towards the beginning of his hike. I felt better about the fact that I haven’t been suffering that long; yet hoping my case is nearing its end. The rest of the day was just hiking and getting use to the pack again.  I was ready to stop at the 12 mile mark, but Mel wanted to hike her longest day today and to get to a shelter Incase it rained tonight (like forecasted). My brain said to stop, my heart said to go on and I said a quick prayer to God.  I was happy for Mel’s personal best and this way my hammock stays dry so I don’t have to worry about it this weekend when I Zero.  Tomorrow is a very short day hiking 1.3 miles to a store to wait on Joanie (don’t tell her that she is worth the wait).

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592876,"Late night spaghetti leftovers turned out to be a real key to bouncing back.  I slept pretty well and woke at 7:00 but really didn’t move (Joanie needed sleep too), yet the need for in room coffee got to be too great!  After one cup, we headed downstairs for the continental breakfast.  Turned out to be pretty good with a small egg omelette, banana, waffle, two cups of apple juice and a small bowl of fruit loops.   Back in the room, we continued to talk, share, and just enjoy each other.  I finally admitted that up until this morning I battled thoughts of going home with her and either quitting the hike, or trying to find a way back here in a week.  She wouldn’t allow me, saying that as much as she wanted me home, she didn’t want any regrets for me and knew that it would be difficult to come back after leaving the trail. She still pushed the idea of taking up to a week at a weekly rate hotel to gain strength.  She admitted though, that I had improved even from yesterday. Even noting at after breakfast that my face was even more filled out and didn’t look as drained. Had it not been for that difference, she admitted battling thoughts last night of forcing me to come home.  It is hard to explain, how exhausted, weak, emaciated and dehydrated I had to have been.  It was so good to have her support because it included conflicted feelings; just as I felt!  Joanie knows me better than anyone and I truly love and appreciate her!  We tried to lay down for 45 minutes and rest before checkout but it wasn’t happening.  So we headed out to shop for me at Walmart.  Purchased gummy centrum vitamins, iron supplements, two bottles of high protein chocolate flavored drinks, Clorox wipes, baby wipes, Fabreeze Fabric deodorant spray and an OR 20L watertight Dry Bag. The dry bag replaced my Z Packs Food Blast Bear Bag.  The CF sac had threading coming undone, holes and runs in it and was no longer waterproof.  Probably not Z Packs fault because it was an early model product and the new ones seem to be thicker and working better for others.  I also was jamming to much food into it and stretching the bag more, knowing that durability may be an issue.  At this point, I don’t care so much about the weight as efficiency.  That goes for all my gear.  Prior to the trail, getting the weight as low as possible and manageable as a hiker was a real key.  Once on trail, one learns what personally works and what doesn’t, so weight is less of an issue. Comfort, efficiency, and personal choice become more important.  It was great to fill up the car with gas and check tires before Joanie dropped me off and hit the highway!  Sounds stupid, but made me feel useful.  It was good to get her on the road home earlier than expected.  The trip in worked exactly as it was meant to work, and probably was the final factor to keep me on the trail (God willing).  I couldn’t check into the Holly Inn immediately after she pulled away, but was told it would only take about half an hour. There was a coin laundry close by so I took advantage of it and rewashed  everything, even though I had washed everything at Trail of Hope Hostel. Had a great conversation with an 83’ Thru Hiker that is thinking about doing it again in 19.  He also knew Earl Schafer personally!  Talked with a Truck Driver that asked the typical question, “Do you carry for the crazies?”.  Chowed down on the Oatmeal Raisons cookies that Joanie brought and finally packed everything clean into the pack to return to the Inn. My room was ready and even nicer than I expected.  Spent time cleaning the pack and buckles with Clorox wipes and spraying with the deodorizer before packing everything back up. Spent the afternoon watching the Pocono NASCAR race going on at the other end of the state. Normal year, I would be attending the Michigan race next weekend but this isn’t a normal year!  After the race, walked to the Tavern next door and got more pasta with added chicken breast and salad.  Sipping Bailey’s Irish Coffee afterwards, but soon headed to the room to make sure Joanie was home safe and then it will be off to sleep.  Checking mileage, I am only a little over ten miles to Boiling Springs so that is becoming the goal for tomorrow.  I just have to make sure I don’t push to until I am at least 90%.  Hoping I am on my way to recovery and the second half of this journey of Faith.","

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593066,"Woke well rested but at 5:00 am!  So I had time to kill.  Showered and watched GMA.  Amazing that the news never changes, no matter how long I am on the trail and not watching.  Politics are the same, crime stories both local and national get reported, volcanoes/hurricanes/natural disaster occur and there is some type of feel good story with a returning soldier or family based triumph to brighten the same ol’ same ol’.  Not making light of anything; the news should never lose its force.  However, I put less worry in the everyday occurrences then I once did and seem to want to concentrate  more on my impact on my personal zone of “community”. Having said that, I loved hearing the weather report; whether good or bad!  Knowledge that is important for the trail!  Hating to admit I got frustrated at 7 - 7:30 - 7:45 - 8:00 when the Common area and front desk didn’t open.  At 8:10 I noticed that the back door was open so I walked around and got a banana and coke to drink.  8:30 the door finally opened in front and so I got coffee at that point.  Turning around, I saw Bob from Trail of Hope talking to the Clerk!  He recognized me and once he found out I was waiting on her for a shuttle he offered to take me with the three he was there to pick up.  Boy was I ready! I grabbed my pack and handed off the room key before he or the other hikers were out the door!  Great catching up with him on the short trip down the road to the trail head.  Hiking by 9:10, I was feeling a bit stupid for not having faith that the morning was all pre ordained.  I started hiking slow and not pushing my abdominal fortitude and strength so to speak.  I expected easy trail and fortunately it was rockier and had some boulder sections to climb through. I say I was fortunate, because it caused me to focus and have faith getting back on the trail; rather than over thinking my situation and trying to control the hike.  I purposefully stopped at noon and ate and drank a pedialyte bottle for lunch.  I didn’t take long (1/2 hour), yet I tried to get into a daily routine that will keep me healthy and on trail.  At 1:00, I hit flat pasture land owned by the AT but allowed to be farmed along side the trail. Cool cooperation.  When I re-entered the woods, I knew the backpacker camp for the town of Boiling Springs was just to my right; signaled with actual porta potties!  I headed back and scoped out what was probably the second and only hammock spot in the campground.  I actually am using the same tree as the other hammocker.  He has the same Dutch straps, stakes and a similar CF Tarp with doors.  We got to hammock chat and walk to the Outfitter in the evening.  After the afternoon setup, I headed to town (twice, I forgot items I needed) killing time before dinner.  The town is centered around a beautiful man made but spring fed lake that boils out tons of water.  The river outlet had many fly fishermen wading it and most were having success although the Brookies or Trout did seem a little small. More catch and release!  Saw the same on the pond itself.  What a beautiful setting and community though.  I found out Recon was going to be at the same shelter for tonight, that I stopped for lunch. That means by morning he will have covered in two days what took me five! We will meet for breakfast and he has a package at the P.O. which opens at nine.  I don’t know the plan for tomorrow.  Mine was possibly to only do 8 miles to Rt 11 and visit a diner to continue building up my calories to burn.  I visited the ATC headquarters here and then the Outfitters.  As stated they have more fishing than hiking gear but do carry a nice selection. Yet I struck out on a Platy Bigmouth Bladder and Jet Boil so maybe it’s not meant to be.  I headed to Cafe 101 and it turned out to be Mexican food more than any other.  However, the Tavern is closed on Monday!  So I ate Chicken covered in Chorizo And Cheese with rice and beans.  Wasn’t to bad and I couldn’t quite finish it all but enjoyed putting it on the flat warm shells!  I then headed across the street to the Lake Mart Gas and Convenient Store for Ice Cream, Snickers, and a bottle of Coke Zero.  Walking along the banks of the pond, I stopped and enjoyed desert on a park bench.  Arriving back in camp, I quickly grabbed my Trekking pole to take back to the Outfitters to get the bent portion and clasp replaced.  I was halfway successful; getting the pole but failing on the clasp.  I did purchase Rubber  tips for the rocks after Duncannon and a can of fuel.  Spending way to much money but enjoyed the conversation with my fellow younger hammocker.  Now lying in the hammock, I have felt the rumble of two trains passing by the site! Can’t say we weren’t warned, yet with the wonderful evening and night we are going to have; I will enjoy the train more than a stuffy costly hostel or shelter.  It’s good to be back on the trail closer to Katahdin than Springer.","Rt 34

However, the camp being on the edge of Boiling Springs and the notorious Trains running right next to the camp, made it far from a remote wilderness feel!  Up early but no need to rush. Planned on waiting for Recon to stroll into town for his P.O. pick up a little before 9:00. I dropped my pack at the ATC Headquarters  and was headed for Gas Station Coffee when a shout came from the Cafe 101 patio.   Should have known Recon would have been there before dawn! The cafe was open so that’s were coffee, breakfast and time were killed!  At 8:55 we headed to the Outfitters, Recon wanted a pack cover for his Z Packs Arc Haul to keep the items in the mesh dry, and then to the P.O. for his Resupply. I refilled water for the day at the ATC and put on rain gear as the sky was dreary.  We headed out of town around 10 and left the option to bail at Rt 11 and a diner open, if needed.  However, the hiking was flat and through fields.  We tried to get a read on cows for rain but some were laying down and others were standing!  Just like a weatherman - 50/50.  Before I knew it, we were crossing I76 Pa Turnpike, then Rt. 11, and finally I81.  So strange to see the traffic, lane width and speed of travel!  We walked into a small group of woods and ate lunch out of the pack for my first time in days!  I like the new heavier OR 20L waterproof sac.  It’s easier to see things and fills out and fits the top of the ULA better. We then hiked on, because we were in a 14 mile stretch that doesn’t have water or camping (due to cows, field pesticides, and land easement).  We stopped at the first opportunity for water at AT run “Scott Farm”.  Then we headed on sandwiched between a road and a creek. We finally crossed under Pa. Rt 944 utilizing an volunteer built tunnel that was really well made.  That marked the end of the camping ban; but we were set on the Darlington Shelter and Water.  As we rounded a corner and prepared to hike uphill, we came across a group of hikers at the back of a vehicle. Trail Magic!  Provided by Ang, a previous through hiker.  It was awesome to get a Coke and chips.  I also grabbed a bag of chips to out with diner and a donut roll for breakfast!  Recon couldn’t believe my first day back and out of no where I get a Coke!  He grabbed fruit and Gatorade!  I did grab a small pack of fruit chews! Then we were off!  Like shelters in the past, this one was after a long up!  Yet, I was warned (by Paul’s Bunyon) to stop and sit just before the summit and take in the view; which stretched back to the mountains we crossed last Thursday - Monday in my case.  Impressive view!  Then we finished checking out the shelter but opting for the nearby campsite.  It hadn’t rained and was only suppose to have the possibility of a thunderstorm ending by 7 and clearing for the night.  God kept the rain away until after diner when we sat covered and planned out the next five days and over 100 miles.  Tomorrow, we have decided to get my four day Resupply but head out and not stay in town.  It should be another 14 Miles like today.  I am glad Recon is not pushing the miles at this point.  I am feeling good and on the verge of great; yet I just don’t trust my own judgement and don’t want any setbacks.  I have to keep my Faith in the Lord and know that I can trust him and his outcome!  Today he certainly provided a great reconnection with my hiking brother!","Boiling Springs, Pa

Instead, Recon charted a Resupply for me and then a four mile hike beyond town to the first Shelter.  I am so happy I am with him and didn’t Nero!  God is providing perfect hiking weather for me to build back my strength and energy.  Today remained cloudy, without any chance of rain, low humidity and a high of 65*.  Perfect hiking weather!  We started with a hike through old pasturelands left to turn wild.  We were drenched by the morning dew on waist high grasses. Laughing though, we referred to it as a hiker car wash from the hips down!  Late morning, we had a view of Duncannon from above and the town is nestled in between rivers and mountains. The morning hike saw the first of the rocks that Pa. is known for.  Yet, we maintained a pretty consistent spread all the way down into town.  We went first to the Doyle for lunch, but freezer issue meant at least a half hour wait (plus there was an odor to the place). We headed to another restaurant but it closed at 11, must be breakfast only. So we ended up at a pizza place that actually worked out great.  They had a lunch special for two big slices of pizza and a drink for under 5.  Those slices were equal to a half a medium pizza back home.  I only wanted one so I forced the other in Recon. We both ordered Western Burgers and Fries. Great burger!  Then we headed to the Quickmart which was quick but also costly.  Had everything I needed though, and the grocery store was uphill and to hard to walk too.  My new Food Sac is stuffed but still fit easier than the other into the pack. I am packing lots of bars and candy bars to hopefully put back on some weight!  Although, limited choices, it will work. Then we headed out of town at 2 in the afternoon and crossed over the  Juanita and then the Susquehanna Rivers.  The bridge was long and busy with traffic!  Finally we dropped underneath, crossed Railroad Tracks and started a climb complete with rocks at the top.  We had a nice view of the town the climb out.  It does seem to be a little depressed and struggling for opportunities. Like the Doyle, a booming past but struggling to build a future.  Maybe the same could be said of me?  Something to ponder...   I did put rubber tips (purchased in Boiling Springs) on my trekking poles and I think they will make a difference on the rocks.  Not the poles fault but I did have fall number 7.  Failed to report fall 6 yesterday, which really was a forward stumble but because my ha d and knee hit the ground it has to count.   Today was more serious and caused by a foot slip down a rock that caused a butt landing and because I couldn’t help my self, I almost jammed my wrists trying to break the fall.  Should never break the fall because you break the wrist!  I was lucky and just worked my ha d until it loosened up.  It seemed to take forever to get to the shelter, but we arrived at a camp with a picnic table and stopped .2 short!  Great location except now Bear Box and both our food sacs weight a ton!  We got them hung though, and laughed at the struggle!  All in all, we great day provided by the great God above!","Darlington Shelter

He wobbled and was kind of cute if it wasn’t for the quills.  Sort of like me!  Love-able but kind of ugly and prickly!  The weather again was awesome!  More Sunshine and a little warmer today so I did break a sweat.  It also brought out the snakes to bath in the sun. This was to be the day of the snakes!  We went out on a ledge called Kinter View for Lunch.  However, on the ledge to our right was a big fat Rattler.  To the left was the first Copperhead of the trip.  We ate lunch more towards the trail! Reading Guthooks it said that the only snake sighting was .2 miles to the north of this view.  Just as I mentioned this fact to Recon, he was looking at a snakeskin. Then suddenly he jumped at the sound of a rattle. It was a timber moving down of the rocks we were passing.  Immediately Recon spotted a bigger one also down below. This one was more likely an Eastern Diamond Back because of the more vibrant coloring. Cool experience but it does get the heart rate going!  The rest of the day was planning water and camp spots. One side of the mountain was dry and then after crossing a stream at the bottom, we climbed in more wet, buggy and rocky terrain.  The end promise was a campsite with pine needle flooring, rock seats and the best night sleep on the trail!  It all looked promising until the air was filled with the roar of jets and planes.  There had to be a Base somewhere close by!  We joked about always ready the fine print or a catch to any deal to good to be true.  The amazing thing was that at exactly 5 pm, the noise stopped and we had a lovely dinner by a camp fire!  We will just have to wait and see what time the base opens!","Camp Short of Clark’s Ferry Shelter

The second was a wonderful section of rocks that gave an example of why Pennsylvania got the nick name “Rocksillvanya”. It was all doable, just slows the Hiking speed down. The best part of the day was coming to a parking area that we planned to have lunch at.  While hiking towards the spot we met Mike Burton.  He asked our names and start date.  When I told him, I was gbolt, he recognized me from my early You Tube videos prior to ever leaving.  I remember him commenting and being a positive guy.  In person, he was even better.  He offered us Trail Magic out of the cooler in the back of his truck.  “Take what you want, as much as you want and leave all your trash in the trash bag there.” Suddenly, lunch was that much better!  Others showed as we ate too.  Then Mike showed up so we got a chance to chat about the 2018 Hiker year and our hike.  He is a Southern Gentleman North of the Mason Dixon Line!  We were blown away by, not only his magic, but also his knowledge to keep us up to date!  It made our day for sure and is one more example of this great community surrounding the Trail!

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593628,"Last we heard, no rain for five days.  We heard wrong!  Around midnight there was a hard rain pinging off the tin roof.  Made for great sleep but caused some worry as to what the next day would bring.  Breakfast was awesome and I enjoyed chatting with Chief and Doc both thru hikers from Toledo.  Appropriate because if I was home I would have been in Toledo heading for the Michigan NASCAR Race today.  Instead we left the luxury of the Rock N Sole Hostel and headed into the rain with the promise of a great burger in Port Clinton.  Tom is motivated to stay on schedule and each zero is one more day keeping him from home and family.  He keeps me going as well, so all is good.    No Church today, but Recon illustrated the Good Samaritan story.  A hiker (with a prosthetic arm) was at the Hostel yesterday to pick up a package.  He was tempted too stay but moved on after chatting awhile.  We were hiking along today, when we passed his campsite. It hadn’t turned out to be a great night for him, like it had for us.  Without missing a beat, Recon offered him help with breaking camp and did it in such a way that the offer was graciously accepted.  We only spent about five minutes and mainly helped him to get his wet tent rolled and put into a stuff sac.  However, he mentioned to Recon that this alone, probably saved him an hour of individual work.  Recon left and didn’t think anything of it.   Just blew my mind the way he naturally supports those around him without questioning or looking for personal gain or glory!  We had hoped the rain would be off and on and then clear by five o’clock to set up camp this evening . However, it was a constant downpour that soaked down to the bone.  We made great time to Port Clinton and the Burger was good, along with Chocolate Milk, Ice Tea, and a cup of warm tomato soup!  It was funny because the girl asked if we showered because they sit sticky hikers in the bar, not the dining room. Without missing a beat, Recon told the hostess that we had been taking a shower since 8:30 this morning!  She gave him the once over and sat us!  The meal was a little pricy, well a lot, but it was good for the soul.  There, we found out that the rain isn’t due to stop until late tonight.  Not many options and the shelter (5 miles away) we planned on staying had a full Privy and only held six people.  We asked directions and then headed down the street to a church owned Pavilion.  It’s large and dry with a Port a Potty across the street.  Maybe pizza for dinner.  Lots of junk food and candy.  The only problem is Barn Swallows with Nest all over the place.  Bad news is bird poop, good news is no bugs!  Everything is hung up and drying.  Plenty of Picnic Tables, Benches and chairs to sit on. So far there are seven hikers here and maybe more on the way that are still eating in town.  Still it is awesome that this free dry place is provided by the Church and community.  I also wanted to mention another Pa Gentlemen that emailed me a message and his phone number when I was struggling.  I didn’t ask permission, so I won’t give his name.  I did want to publicly thank him for his support and offer and wish many blessings to him and his family.  The kindness from so many sources is what has kept me going these past two weeks. It will be an early night and long hike tomorrow to get back on schedule, hopefully.  But the Lord is in charge and I look to him to ultimately keep us safe and where he wants us.","Rock N Sole Hostel 1204.1

Rain and wet shoes are hardest on the toes and feet!  The weather did improve steadily resulting in low 70 degree weather with sunshine occasionally peeking through the Green Tunnel. We had three wonderful views, Pulpit Rock, The Pinnacles, and Dan’s Pulpit.  They came with the cost of Boulder Scrambles, which was fine.  However, those boulders gave way to trail that was made of medium size rocks.  Too small to step and balance on, yet too large to step between and avoid.  It really slowed the pace and we weren’t doing what I would call “hiking”.  It often got frustrating and was more like a new dance.  Supinate, Pronate, Slide, Foot Jam and repeat...two, three, four!  My knees were screaming by the time we started down the blue blaze to quite for the day.  The problem was that cutting yesterday short meant that we had too quite at 2:00 pm or go another five miles before the next water and camp.  It made for a tiring +22 mile day.  Tomorrow is less Miles but the rocks are here to stay until well into New Jersey.  So we have to embrace the suck of walking on rocks!  I know I will sleep well tonight.","Port Clinton Pavilion

However, the forecast is calling for storms tomorrow and the climb out of Lehigh Gap is hand over hand rock climbing, followed by the Superfund Wasteland caused by Zinc plants in the 1900’s.  We ate an early dinner, rested, and debated hiking on.  A SOBO Section Hiker gave us the best intel saying that the rain would really make it difficult.  So at 4:00 we left, planning on doing two miles; one going down and then one climbing out.  The climb was some hand over hand but not as long or as difficult as had been anticipated.  That is always good, when that happens.  Actually, Recon and I headed Right when we should have bore left and made the climb more difficult until we summited the rock portion from the opposite side of the white blazes.  I could tell the Lord was with me!  We finished the climb but didn’t past the one and only campsite.  That added another 3 miles for a total addition of five miles to the day, due to the wasteland.  We are at the first nice campsite with Doc and Chief from Toledo.  It will make it nice because we have short miles to meet Recons Childhood friend that is opening his home to us for a Nero!  Should be fun and help to get us out of the rain.","Allentown Hiking Club Shelter

On the phone my wife told me I seemed more heartbroken over him leaving than I was over her leaving at Amicalola.  She doesn’t know how hard it was to hike those steps as she drove away.  However, I am also sure tomorrow will be a difficult process to hike away from Recon, as well. I just hope and pray he has a quick return to the trail and the hike he is suppose to experience; whether we rejoin or not, is all in God’s hands.  Had a great bacon and eggs breakfast cooked by Kevin and then Recon bought Subway Lunches.  Tonight was dinner at Blue Mountain Resort Pub and Grill.  It’s a winter ski area and a beautiful view of the Pennsylvania Mountains.  The food was awesome, fries were out of this world, and once again Kevin wouldn’t take money for the meal from anyone!  Ruth joked about her trepidation when they first discussed Recon visiting and bringing a guy he met on the trail with him!  Yet once again, they opened their home and blessed two Thru Hikers.  They have become an important part of this epic journey. Conversations with Recon and Ruth today really impacted me spiritually again.  Ruth even said, “You have to listen very carefully to hear God speak in the people and things around you”.  So as I head to sleep tonight, I continue to think of the passage, “Those that wait upon the Lord, Shall renew their Faith”.  My faith is continually being renewed on the AT, thanks to wonderful people such as Recon, Kathy, Kevin and Ruth that I didn’t even know when I started March 15th.

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594363,"Kevin drove Recon, Little Gage and myself to the Trailhead so I could start hiking close to 8.  Thanks to five year old Gage, I have his favorite car song - Slip Away by Greg Allman forever stuck in my brain!  It was appropriate to slip away into the woods but was so bittersweet to leave Recon behind to heal up.  It felt strange to be hiking away as they drove off.  Yet, I am so appreciative of the support Recon offered me ever since Albert Mtn. Mile 100.  I would have never met nor been blessed by Kevin or Ruth without Recon.  He so eloquently wrote a Facebook post thanking them for their gracious hospitality.  I fail to find words to express how easily they blessed me as an unknown hiker coming into their home!  My mind was whirling with emotions this morning, so I tried to listen to podcasts to occupy my brain.  God wouldn’t have any of that and had a Southbound Section Hiker stop to talk about a turtle just up the trail.  Turns out his truck is in Wilkes Barre were a tornado struck Wednesday night and he happened to be on the ridge that we luckily avoided.  He talked about being protected and dry under a low hanging spruce.  When we chatted some more I found out he was a fellow Buckeye from Springfield Ohio and also knew the retired deputy that I camped with the first night after  Springer!  Amazing the way things work!  I continued on and never saw the turtle that was probably faster than either of us. It was a short while later that another SOBO  approached and then called me by my trail name.  It was Iceman who had offered help, support and encouraging prayers in my guestbook!  I recognized him for another reason I couldn’t figure out until he admitted that he had helped out Early Riser a well known 2017 Thru Hiker. He hiked back north to Wind Gap with me. It made the last of the 8 morning miles so pleasurable. I could just tell he is a great man, especially when he mentioned being married for 45 years (10 more than me).   When we hit the trail head, a SOBO Section Hiker (that will have finished over a 1,000 Miles from Katahdin South when she stops at Pine Grove State Park) was raving and inviting us to enjoy the trail magic she found.  It was even better to see her expression when she discovered that it was provided by Iceman standing in front of her.  Yet, I could tell that he doesn’t do it for the acknowledgement like she was able to share; but just out of the goodness of his heart.  He offered to take her into town but she declined, so he ended up driving me to town for lunch.  Not only that, he wouldn’t let me pay and picked up the tab!   My cup overflowed with blessings this morning!  He is truly part of the AT community and shared stories of other current and past hikers such as Lucky who hiked with Nate and Sharon (The Hiking Vikings).  I also learned that he had helped out a fellow thru hiker named Ringo who happens to be from my hometown! It just amazed me that this gentleman simply gives and asks nothing in return; yet, fully enjoys life!  Such an example for me to learn from!  When we returned to the trail head, Pulitzer, Lost Boy and Kodak were enjoying the trail magic.  Kodak remembered me being sick at Trail of Hope Hostel when he slack packed with Whisperer!  Amazing people on this trek!  Pulitzer asked about my hiking buddy and it was sad to report he is taking some time to heal. Everyone seems to be slowing because of Rocksylvania.  Iceman loaded up and i am not sure how I could ever thank him enough for his kindness. I understand that expression, “My cup overfloweth” a little better after this week.  Hearing everyone was headed to town (DWG), I felt good about only having 9 miles to the shelter and water for the afternoon.  I even thought that I could make it by 3:30 or 4 at the latest.  Ha! How wrong I was.  The trail from Wind Gap to DWG is probably the worse rocks around.  Not the boulders but the ones imbedded in the trail at weird angles.  The past week we had short stretches followed by gravel road or soft trail.  Today they were relentless.  I maybe had a mile that I didn’t have to really concentrate.  There was the one view at Wolf Rocks but again the price was climbing in around and over boulders.   I didn’t hit the shelter until 5:30 so it took time and a toll on me.  Yet, how could I curse the rocks out of anger and frustration?  Instead, I had to smile at the blessings bestowed on me.  Especially, when I realized that this is June 15th and I happened to have done the Approach Trail and left Springer Mtn on March 15th.  So in so many ways, this was a full circle day and it turned out exactly as God had intended it to.  Ruth had a sign in the Kitchen that said, “Don’t worry about Tomorrow - God is Already There”.  Today that proved true!","Smith Gap Mile 1271.1

Packed up part way and then left for coffee at the Gas Station, then a great egg and sausage sandwich at the bakery. Finished loading the back pack which has ten pounds of food and fully loaded is 42 pounds.  Probably the only guy on the trail that has increased rather than decreased pack weight!  I just carry it and don’t worry about it anymore. Talked with a father that is hiking a little with his daughter who is thru hiking and is also related to Earl Shafer.  He also lives in Arizona so it was a very enjoyable conversation.   Church was at 10 and it was a great message that included celebrating dads.  I said some prayers for Recon and his Doc for tomorrow and many for my Brother in Law.  Found out this afternoon that he made a turn for the better; so God is great and prayers work!  I felt very relaxed leaving the hostel and hiking on around noon.  Immediately crossed the Delaware River with I 80 traffic flying by!  Didn’t matter, when I hit the Pa - NJ line, I celebrated and sat in the hot sun for pics!  Soon it was time to move on and walk the trail under the  traffic above.  This is the Kittatinny Visiter Center with various trails along with the AT.  I chatted with a family that asked great questions about me hiking from Georgia!  All the way up the trail, I saw fathers out and about.  The trail is Rocky but they aren’t Pa. Rocks!  They also aren’t quite as thick and jaded, yet still frustrating if I attempt to hike to fast.  I quickly slowed to 2 miles per hour and tried to enjoy the afternoon. The pedometer rolled over 1300 miles right as I reached Sunfish Pond, a National Landmark!  It was beautiful to hike around and even the rocks didn’t spoil it.  Chatted with a guy that was cooling off a snapping turtle with water as the snapper worked his way towards the lake.  Soon I left the crowds behind and climbed up to a ridge.  The view from Raccoon Mtn was nothing like I ever imagined New Jersey would look like.  It was gorgeous!  The rocks did start to wear on my knees as it got closer to my stop time of 5 pm. I would have camped up top but water was the issue.  My the time I found water, the camp spot wasn’t great and mosquitoes seemed to be a major issue; replacing the Nats that live to fly in your eyes.  I hate bug spray but using it liberally as the lesser of two evils.  Though I had planned to stop short, I ended up at the Mohican Outdoor Center and paid for a Coke and a campsite.  Saw my first bear but it’s a resident around here and was messing with dumpsters.  Doesn’t count in my book!  However, that is one of the reasons for the campsite, they all have bear Boxes to make food storage easy.  During check in and while I drank the coke, I visited with Irish Paul and his Son!  So good to catch up with them although technically they are a day ahead of me.  Also met R2K who is interviewed by Mighty Blue on the Podcast “Return to Katahdin”.  He is also raising money for the ATC itself!  Great to put a face and a real person to the personality on the airways.  Although, he is pretty straight forward and is who he is.  I hated to break away but had to set up the hammock and get dinner going.  The mosquitoes still harassed me during dinner, but many didn’t survive between my slapping hand and the bug juice. I got a sweet text that included a touch of sarcasm that my daughter is known for!  She said she’s proudly  of the hike I have undertaken, and Proud to be my daughter.  I am even more proud of how my daughters have become such great young women.  The older one is flying back from a wedding in Canada and the message souls to deliver.  I had the same issue with my wife this evening.  The signal that was so great in Pa.  may not be as great in NJ.  However, I don’t want signal if the rocks come with them!  Overall, a great day even though the miles were short.

In the middle of the night he sent a cooling rain and by morning the mosquitoes weren’t nearly the issue they had been!  I packed quickly and decided to have breakfast on the trail.  Again, God had reservations for me at an active fire tower (so I did t climb this one) that had picnic table with a great view.  Later I took a break at Large Stone Pavilion on Sunrise Mountain with a view to the Pocono Sky Resorts to the west and the Jersey High Point and Wawayanda Mountains to the East.  I had lunch at a small overlook but really rushed to get to the High Point State Park HQ because they give a free Pepsi to they Hikers courtesy of the Friends of High Point Knob!  Late Start was even more thrilled than I and beat me to it!    But he was really disappointed when he found out that the Concession State ahead is closed!  The one can had to do us for the entire day!  We headed on and came to the Observation Tower with views of Marcy Lake below and the Washington type Monument on High Point Knob.  We ended up going to the Knob 1st (otherwise we wouldn’t have climbed it later) and walked in and around the monument that sits at the highest point in NJ.  We then headed back down to catch a trail to Marcy Lake.  Getting to the lake was easy. Getting to the Beach and Shower building was tougher than the AT. I probably added 3 Miles that don’t count except to my feet, to the day!  When we finally got there, I changed into Swim Shorts and took a dip in the lake, followed by clothes washing in the sink, a nice hot shower, and then taking everything out in the sun to dry!  Late Start did the same and we both decided to eat dinner at the picnic tables there.  Finally, I had to get moving to set up at the High Point Shelter for the night.  I think Late start continued on because he wanted to do at least ten miles today.  I had my 15+ so I was set and feel lucky that the day turned out as chilled as it did!  It’s amazing how well things go when you just try and Keep the Faith.","Culver’s Gap

I looked at him...He looked at me... and fell down laughing and pointing at my bare butt!  His friends Mr. Coyote and Ms Deer were laughing so hard, tears were rolling down their face.  Chipmunk and squirrel were holding there bellies and chuckling so hard, acorns came out their nose!  I put back on my clothes and that’s all I have to say about that!  Actually, the trail was so busy with walkers and other users that were fully clothed, so I saw no evidence of anyone hiking naked and wisely chose to stay fully clothed all day long!  Many chatted with me on the NJ Pochuck Boardwalk.  Beautifully elevated and maintained boards! When I responded that I am trying to “Thru Hike”, many responses that I would do it and that I looked strong!  Good to hear, especially after Pa.  Lower miles and food does seem to be rejuvenating me!  Today was no different.  After six miles I hit the Heavenly Hills Farm for Coffee, Donut, a Peach, Sprite and a cup of ice cream while I recharged technology.  Then across the street to Hot Dog Stand for lunch!  Killed over two hours just chilling and chatting especially with three Section hikers that were at camp last night and tonight.  Two guys and a gal probably slightly older than I. They know their gear and if you didn’t know, they could pass for Thru Hikers. Except the lady... she has orthodontics and is the only person on the trail with an Electric Toothbrush and a Dental Sac! It’s been fun hiking with them, so I thought I would give them a shout out!  The afternoon hike was a little more challenging with a good climb up WaWayanda Mountain.

I can feel small increments of change as I gain strength and trust in the Lord.  It is a slow process and I backslide often. Last night was a perfect example. As is the routine, I went to charge my phone into the Anker Battery Charger.  Reached for where it is suppose to be and it wasn’t there!  Searched the hammock high and low.  Searched the inner pack liner high and low!  Searched the pack itself high and low!  Nothing.  Vented to the wife as I explained that I was shutting down the phone to save battery.   I swore I packed it after I charged it at Heavenly Hills. But maybe, just maybe I left it on the table.  Or I thought it went into the pack but it fell out!  I thought I unpacked it though; surely I would have realized it during camp set up.  Looked through everything again.  I am sooo stupid, but wife is correct, I am just human.  The place doesn’t even open till 9:00 to see if it is even there!  Chances are slim anyway.  Well getting late and frustrated.  All I can do is pray to God for a miracle and trail magic to get me six miles back, twelve miles round trip.  Maybe I can buy another on Amazon but where would I ship it too and I really don’t have the money.  This sucks!  But then again, Recon wasn’t phased when he left a bladder hanging at a shelter.  I should be more like that and not sweat the minor inconveniences of life.  But I am not there yet; this still sucks!  Finally I fell asleep.  Early morning, just as the sun was breaking I was awaken by a voice telling me to check underneath me.  I did and felt something outside the hammock, so I reached out and get between the hammock and the bottom quilt!  There was the pouch!  It must of gotten caught up in the quilt or when I flipped the hammock to clean it, it rolled into the quilt.  It was there the whole time and got knew it. I just needed to slow down and not get so aggravated!  I am better than I was before the hike, but I still have a ways to go.  I am just thankful that the God is still watching out for me, even with my little Faith at times.  Needless to say, the day started much better than I anticipated and what a day it was!    Hiking deep in thought, I lost the trail.  Went off to the right about .1 without a blaze,  came back to the spot were I last saw a blaze and took off down a trail but no second blaze.  Turned around and went back to the actual blazed tree and look at what became an obvious marked trail of course going straight up!  But up went onto rock outcropping that in New Jersey have become enjoyable to walk on.  This one was because it led to three strips (two yellow and white in middle) along with a Marker.  Just to the right of this painted in white was NJ/NY. This was the State Line! 8 down and 6 to go!  I did celebrate a little!  Texted my daughter that lives in New York! Then hiked on.  New York caught me by surprise.  There were more blazes on rocks than trees.  More granite stone outcroppings.  I came across my first Rebar Ladder during the day. The most difficult though was a mental anguish  as I came to Prospect Rock.  Prospect Rock is the highest point of the AT in New York and offers a view all the way to New York City.  I barely made the skyline out.  There use to be a flag painted on one of the rocks but it has been replaced by a majestic flag on a tree staff.  Many hiking today are too young now and don’t realize why the flag flies here.  Thru hikers in 2001 actually sat on Prospect Rock and saw the smoke rise from the attack on the Twin Towers.  I am still brought to tears by the memory of that morning!  I walked on in deep thought once again. I finally started to descend a little and based on the time, I was hoping I was getting close to the road.  I came up to Bev the female Section Hiker and chatted with her as I went a little further ahead.  Suddenly, I saw a good size bear cross the trail right in front of me,  I walked a little and clanked my poles and shouted.  The bear moved off trail a little, stopped and looked at me as if to say, “Is that really necessary”. Bev caught me as I tried to video him, and she hiked on.  I finished as the Bear still stood and watched, and then I moved on.  He seemed to know these woods, has a routine, and isn’t impressed by hikers like me!  It was still cool being the first of this AT trip and he was beautiful with such nice shiny black fur!  I sent the video to Bev at the road when we were greeted by Trail Magic. Tentman had Coke, Candy, and Orange, a chair and then a new pair of Darn Tough Socks just like I was wearing.  (Because I have a new pair I passed these on). After signing Tentman’s book we headed off to the hotdog stand for lunch!  Two dogs, chips and a Coke!  After which came time for Desert at the Creamery a short distance beyond the Stand.  A large Banana Hot Fudge Sunday!  Plus my three Section hiking friends pointed out the High Point Monument we were all at a few days ago.  It is off in the distance for sure, but cool to think we hiked that far!  Then their cab arrived and it was time to say goodbye.  Sad to see them leave and not be at camp tonight, but glad to have hiked with them.  Myself, it was back to the trail and on to the shelter due to possibility of rain tonight.  Only two miles but more rock outcroppings and another view before reaching the blue blaze side trail.  Late Start showed up and set his tent like a bivy up in the shelter due to mosquitoes. I decided to do the same with my hammock.  It’s working but I don’t know whether to count this as a shelter stay or hammock!  Doesn’t matter, God is controlling this hike; I just have to keep the faith and keep hikN^.  PS.

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595231,"If Sunday is a day of rest, I came as close to it without zeroing as possible!  Woke after sunrise and laid in the hammock till 7:50 and May Sure the light rain we had in the night has stopped completely.  The tarp was still wet and and other things damp but not miserable.  Then it was off for a stroll down the mountain to Tiorati Circle/Lake.  I listened to a Worship song and made it most of the way through a Podcast Sermon but was soon into a crowd of people.  There was a bicycle ride at “a” or “the” support station was right at the circle.  I went to a picnic table a little further away and waited for the Swimming and Shower Area to open at ten but it turned out to be eleven o’clock instead.  Ate some breakfast, looked at the book and decided to go to a shelter that offered views of the Hudson River and a portion of Northern New York City.  Then I called home which really boosted my emotions and brought real joy to the day.  I struggled after yesterday and these low miles work on my mind, but they shouldn’t.  I continue to struggle and let Go(d).  It shouldn’t be hard, so many times he has saved me, or show his presence on this journey.  Yet, just as in my past, I struggle with what I should do on my own and what is his will for me.  The phone call home was just what I needed at this time and was a blessing.  I then took a shower and did laundry at the same time!  It is good and refreshing but not great like at home or in a Hostel for some reason.  I tried to recharge my phone and dry out the shirt and shorts, while continuing to text home.  I had to leave at 12:30 though to get to camp by 5:00 no matter how many short miles.  I received an uplifting text and pic from my Virginia Section turned Day Hikers.  That helped make my morning as well and I thought of my blessings as I hiked.  The trail is well used, being an hour from NYC.  I meet the Arizona couple from yesterday, again today and they spoke of the next view being a good one.  It was a beautiful view being so close to a big city!  I then past a Trail Volunteer that confirmed the West Mountain Shelter was a beautiful view of northern NYC and also told me of forecasted T-Storms from 4:30 to 7:30.  I told him I had heard thunder behind me, but he said that may have been West Point firing Cannons.  I forgot we were that close to the Military Academy.   I hiked on and then soon played Frogger to get across the Palisades Interstate Parkway.  It is four lanes with a wooded divider in the middle.  It is and was the most difficult road crossing on the AT.  I only went across two lanes and turned right to walk down to the visitors center for the drivers of the parkway. The two cokes this morning weren’t enough, I needed a Dr. Pepper and some pretzels.  I also filled a water bottle.   Sources have been scarce here and it will be difficult for the bubble behind me unless there is some really good soaking rainfall. I charged my phone a little because it seems to be going through the juice quickly. Then I looked out and it was starting to rain just like it was forecasted.  So on went the pack cover.  When I thanked the attendant and joked about the two lane crossing I had left, they stated that it would be easy because everyone is heading southbound back to the city and I had already crossed those lanes.  They were correct, but still a challenge in the rain. It lightened up immediately when I got back in the woods.  Slowly the Sun worked its way back out and soon I was pouring the sweat again. As I was climbing I stopped as a couple asked me if I was Thru Hiking.  I then found out Rick and Kitty run Stony Point Center.  They told me about the place and rate ($50 but maybe another $20 for Shuttle ride). He called my phone so I have the number to call tomorrow if I choose to stay.  I am really thinking this is God telling me that this is a better plan than just hiking through  Ft. Montgomery.  I just want to be a good steward of money on this journey as well.  I hiked on up the mountain and found the side trail to the shelter.  It is a long way off trail, suppose to be .5 but more like .8.  I went past a beautiful campsite in a pine stand and for some reason made a note of it. A little way up the trail, I meet a lady coming from the shelter.  She stated she encounter four snakes, two of which were rattlers and that ruined her plan. To stay there.  I was a little more unsure but had to at least take in the view.  Over one rock outcropping I followed two Turkeys with little ones in tow.  Tried to video them for Recon but wasn’t successful I don’t think.  Cool none the less and they quickly disappeared into the brush.  As I headed on, I saw the first Rattler she warned about as it slithered in front of my left foot rattling its tail as it disappeared under the brush.  I continued on a little more cautious and nervous than before.  The view was beautiful and I looked around the shelter and debated staying. I searched around and found a good hammock hang close by but the Lady has me kind of rattled and it looked like I was going to be there alone.  Not sure if I made the right choice or not, but I headed back to the pine stand.  After I set up and dried clothes in the late day sun, a hiker and his dog went on to the shelter.  Maybe I did make the wrong choice.  Too late, all set up and ready to cook dinner that was cut short by a thunderstorm moving in.  One of those short hard gully washers with light I g for 30 minutes and a total of an hour before the sun pops out again one last time before setting.  The Lord kept me safe and dry but the wind and rain was strong for awhile.  Hopefully it is done for the night and I can sleep well.  Pass 1400 miles tomorrow, cross Bear Mountain and down into the Zoo, lowest point on the AT and then possibly Stony Point.  Just have to Keep the Faith.","Fingerboard Shelter

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595333,"Last night, after the thunderstorm and rain stopped, I was serenaded with a Trail Magic Professional Concert from a band down below the mountain. It was some type of outdoor music concert and I am sure, based on the sound system, that people paid good money for the tickets!  I heard it for free until I fell asleep.  Others said the Latino music lasted until close to one in the morning.  Everyone seemed to enjoy the rhythm and beat, even though words couldn’t be distinguished. This morning, I was up and out by 7:30 and had beautiful views of Bear Mountain.  It actually does look like a bear laying down!  As I crossed a road separating the two mountains, and climbed just a short way up; there was the 1400 mile marker!  Hard to believe that I have come this far, but hate that the last 100 miles since last Sunday have been without my Trail Brother Recon.  I continue to hope for his speedy recovery! Soon I was 3/4 of the way up and could look back from where I came off West Mtn.  Seems so far looking back some times. As I approached a rock outcropping, I spotted my Section hiking turned Day hiking friends!  Was able to be part of a group pic that they sent to me.  There was a wood bench that I took a pic of Pac-Man and his wife Pace-car.  I think they will really enjoy that pic in the future.  Later I had mine taken, before saying goodbye to my trail friends.  So strange, ten minutes earlier, I would have missed them coming down a different path from their drop off point!  Soon I was back to climbing until I saw the famous Pringle and Drink Machines.  I rushed over for a Coke but sold out! Settled for a tea which was still good.  Then to the top where there is a tower.  Climbed it and was surprised by the great view of the Mountains I had crossed, Bear Mtn Bridge, Hudson River and a distant glimpse of the New York City skyline!  Stopped and chatted with retired Doctors that still live in the city and enjoyed that.  Really beautiful.  Then down hill to the base and Bear Mtn Picnic area. It circles Hessian Lake which really was beautiful and once again offered views back up the steep Bear Mtn I had just descended. PAC Man and Pace Car shouted that the concession stand was open, so I had to grab lunch and a Coke!  No Coke so settled for Dr. Pepper.  While there, Late Start showed up but just sat because he had already resupplied and said he had too much food in his pack.  We then headed to the Trail Side Zoo.  I finally got a Coke and bought Late Start one as well, while we entered and walked through the zoo.  The reptile. Place was pretty cool, especially the big Timber Rattler behind glass!  Not a great deal to see but they are all orphaned or rescue/rehab animals that couldn’t survive in the wild.  I liked the Owls the best.  They have two bears.  One is huge! And enjoys laying in a mesh hammock.  The other is more Tan than black but looks a little healthier and moves around more.  The exhibit was ruined by a flock of Turkey Vultures all around the bear pin.  Don’t know what draws them but didn’t care for that.  Directly across from the Bears is a sign designating the spot as the lowest elevation on the entire AT and 120 ft above sea level.  I guess now, it is all uphill from here!  My favorite part was the exhibit for the history of this area starting with a Mastodon Bones, Skull and Tusk   that was discovered 14 Northwest of the Zoo.  Then came the Native American artifacts and finished with the Revolutionary War and the nearby fort and surrounding area that was fought over due to the control of the Hudson River. Upon exiting the Zoo you are at the Toll booth for the Bridge that I will cross tomorrow.  Instead I said goodbye to Late Start and called Rick at the Stony Point Center for a shuttle.  He picked me up and talked about the center which is a combine project putting together Presbyterians, Jews and Muslims.  They grow a lot of their own produce and it seems to be a very relaxed environment.  However, laundry would have to wait until after three for housecleaning to finish up.  I asked Rick if I could Resupply first and he obliged. I enjoyed getting the 5 days worth and just sort of strolled the aisles.  It turned out to be New York City expensive but what can you do!  We are too close to the big Apple. He picked me back up after I texted him and soon I
Check into the Resort.  My room reminds me of a dorm room, two beds per room, shared but private shower and restroom.  Overall nothing fancy but nice and relaxing. I did laundry (they actually found me loaner clothes) and spent the afternoon sorting the pack and packaging way too much food!  Dinner was AYCE and very good. The Cherry Cobbler desert was a sugar high I needed!  All in all, for a low point on the AT, it was a good day!","West Mountain Shelter

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595438,"Up at six but breakfast wasn’t until 8 so I packed and adjusted things too accommodate a five day food supply and lots more weight!  Went over to the main building for coffee at 7:30 and planned a short 8.7 mile day.  I didn’t expect to hit the trail until 9:30 or 10. I also continued to do the math by dividing total miles left by various miles per day and looking at the calendar.  It truly is up to the good Lord whether I even finish or not, but it’s comforting to know that even with low Miles, I can finish mid to late September without any issues.  I was surprise to see that I passed 100 days on the trail and am actually at 104.  Again, not a big deal, just interesting.  I truly am following the quote I heard, “It’s a race to Katahdin, and the one that gets there last, or takes the longest - wins.”  However, with under 800 miles left, I am starting to push for home and family.  Right as I started for the breakfast line, Rich asked if I wanted to get on the trail sooner rather than later?  He had a 9:15 meeting so we settled on an 8:30 departure time; much better than I ever thought.  The shuttle back to the trail and conversation with Rich was very enjoyable.  He truly has a servants heart and was a blessing when I needed it.  I also loved a placard in the Center that stated,  “Let God walk in front of you and be your Guide. Let God walk beside you and be your friend.  Let God walk behind you and encourage you on your way.” It’s just hard for me to live in faith and let God even hike with me!  Everyone knows that about me anyway!  It was fun walking across the Bear Mtn Bridge over the Hudson.  It’s more of a lake than a river it’s so wide there.  Neat suspension bridge and soon I was turning left up a road and then right back into the woods for a climb up and away from civilization. It was a good morning and the miles clicked off.  I passed Late Start still sleeping in a tent at the side of the trail.  Passed the Arizona Couple and chatted with them about their stay and hike.  Finally I passed the younger and older Georgia Gals (the one warned me about the snakes at the Shelter). They mentioned that the Appalachian Market was only 3.4 miles away and looking at my watch, I could make that by 12 for lunch, so I was off and hiking - fast.  Actually got there at 11:30 and the ladies showed up at 12:15.  It was a great slice of pizza, chips and Coke. Followed by a Brisk Ice Tea and Ice Cream!  Hate to bore you, but that seems to be all hikers talk about, think about and dream about,  is non camp food!  I am just going to hate it when I stop getting at least one Coke a day!  Oh the Agony of it!  I left at 12:30 and in the zone so much, I missed my first stopping point which was the Graymore Spiritual Life Center run by Monks but they have let hikers tent on their property for over 40 years.  The trail had a lot of blowdowns from a microburst or tornado at some point.  It is pretty well cleared, yet the effect is still very visible. Apparently, I hike through an even worse section in the morning.  The animal of the day was little skinks, a lizard that has the prettiest blue/turquoise tail. They’re quick little guys but you can catch that blue just before it slips to the backside of the tree or log. Soon I was at the last water source with a camp just .1 Miles beyond.  So I loaded up with water for the evening and thought I should looked for a place to hang.  I didn’t like the bugs or the low area so I crossed a road and hiked on.  I came to the ruins and a plaque stating that
The foundation was a building used in 1776 under orders from General Washington for soldiers to be inoculated against  a smallpox epidemic. So much history along this trail! I knew I didn’t want to go another 9 miles to the next listed camping area in a state park.  I also wanted to leave 15 miles to the next shelter. So, I said a prayer and walk up the trail looking left and right.  Checked out one spot but it didn’t feel right. Went a little further and saw a stone wall and two trees perfectly spaced.  When I arrived, there was a camp fire ring so it had been used in the past and suddenly became my home after hiking 11.6 miles for the day.  Low but just the right amount to make this day a relaxing reintroduction into the woods and away from civilization.","Stoney Point Center

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595545,"First hour into the morning hike, I came to a road crossing with a parking area.  While checking Guthooks, a group of three called over and asked if I was NOBO and then if I wanted a bottle of Gatorade?  Of course I did!  Kingsman from Cincy knew me as a fellow Buckeye and also had read some of my journal.  His partner was No Filter and they were slacking back south to the bridge.  None other than No Name was the shuttle driver.  After they headed off, I chatted with No Name who I hadn’t seen since the base of Roan Mtn when he was hiking with No Service.  Both are off the trail.  No Name with a pre ruptured tendon in his foot and No Service with a Copperhead Snake bite of all things!  It was amazing though, because No Name still has the glimmer in his eye and the trail still has a hold of him.  He stated that he is not finished, just rethinking how he is going to hike it; besides doing it as a Thru.  I have no doubt he will be back on trail.  The rest of the morning I contemplated all the hikers including Recon, that are injured and off the AT.  I must admit, when I started this journey, I fought cockiness but knew some confidence was a necessary ingredient.  I heard it said so many times that it is mostly a mental challenge.  Thus, those that don’t finish, just didn’t have the mental toughness to get through.  While this may be true for the first stage of the hike, getting past Neals Gap and maybe at least to Damascus; it is not so much a reality after Virginia.  Those hikers making it into Pa. are mentally and physically strong enough to make it all the way.  So now I understand that it really isn’t Mental Toughness but truly the Grace of God that keeps us on the trail.  Any one of ten falls could have ended my hike.  Stomach Flu and dehydration could have ended my hike.  Everyday, a stumble or even a road crossing could end my hike.  I know you get tired of hearing me say it, but it is truly Faith and Gods Grace that keeps me going.  Actually, I have heard it said that each day we wake we should be grateful for another day on earth because nothing is guaranteed.  I understood that my entire life but on a superficial level.  Each day that this hike continues, I really understand being grateful for the blessing of that day at a much deeper level.  I was pulled out of this deep thinking by the trail narrowing onto an elevated pathway built up with rocks on both sides.  This was an old mining road used to carry ore, that I was now walking on.  Pretty Cool.  It finished near a side trail down to Canopus Lake Beach and concession stand.  Actually, it was multiple new buildings up from the beach that included Restrooms and a shower (I passed on) plus a cafe (I couldn’t pass on) Nothing sounded good on the menu so I just got a Coke and a Bag of Chips to add to my lunch at the picnic tables.  I actually wanted a Tuna Salad Wrap from my Food bag!  I really hiked the extra distance for the Coke and then of course a Lipton Lemonade, topped off with a Hershey Sundae; eaten with a little wooden spoon.  Altogether that
Cost $10 so I really didn’t save that much but still enjoying these NY stops.  Then I backtrack to hop back on the AT as it started to sprinkle, just as forecasted.   Yet, it only threatened and never did pour on me.  I had one major view for the day and found an American Flag painted on the Rock face. I think it was done in memory of 9-11, but that part had faded.  Yet the Flag was still beautiful and helped my American Spirit.   Then it was the long down hill to the Ralph’s Peak Hiker Shelter or RPH Shelter. It actually started as a Cabin but had one side removed that now forms a roofed patio. There are three Bunks with six beds and plenty of sitting area.  Best of all, pizza or Asian food can be delivered here.  There are also neighbors around.  When I arrived Stickers had already sweep and was waiting on Lady Bug.  Shortly after, a SOBO Section Hiker walked in.  I have a lower bunk all set up and am chilling and glad to be in doors.  It is suppose to be a hard rain tonight through tomorrow morning.  This is a blessing to be tucked away in here to wait out the rain.  Plus, Lo mein Noodles and Fried Rice Is on the docket to be delivered for dinner! Also had a 20 oz Dr. Pepper. Doc and Chief from Toledo have returned to the trail and are taking the last two bunks.  Others have shown up and are on the floor and a few are tenting in the rain.  I am truly grateful for today.","Canopus Hill Rd

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595641,"As forecasted, the rain started after dinner and continued through the night.  Checking the weather at 5:30, flash flood warnings were posted for the area until 9:00.  Some hardy souls were up and getting ready for a high milage day into Pawling, NY; but I rolled over and tried to sleep.  Memories of leaving Rock N Sole Hostel and Hiking into Port Clinton soaked to the bone, haunted my thoughts and kept me out in the dry bunk in the RPH Cabin.  By 6:30, sleep was not possible so I tried to start reading a new Kindle Book.  But that was finished after one chapter.  At this point, everyone in the Shelter was awake and moving around, even if it was just in the bunk.  Soon I was up and having coffee (a rare treat that I haven’t done on days I hike) and breakfast.  I was joined by Doc and Chief who also were contemplating a Zero or what this wet day would bring.  The forecast didn’t look promising but it’s hard to trust in these mountain areas.  I found out that Doc fell and twisted his ankle at the same spot I fell, after the Lemon Squeeze.  He agreed if it weren’t for the Grace of God, he could have been injured worse than he was.  After breakfast, the sky’s lightened up and it looked like the day was going to clear up.  I checked the App “My Radar” and it showed that we were definitely going to clear for a short window of time.  Everyone started packing up gear and planning on a short mile day to the next shelter nine miles away.  Of course there was a Deli just 5.1 Miles away that also helped motivate the feet.  I had Slip #11 on a wet sloping Rock.  Nothing hurt, but I am now in the habit of reflecting on what I was focusing on when these falls occur.  This fall, I had been thinking about a rumor that involved a hiker that I have hiked with a few times.  As is the case, I have no first hand knowledge about whether the gossip is true or not.  Such is the case with rumors and Gossip and also how they can damage a hikers/persons reputation.  The slip cause me to push that negativity away and not to become a spreader of falsehood.  Soon I was at the deli and eating a Great Pastrami Sandwich on a roll     Of course I also had a Soda some chips and the. Ice Cream for dessert!  The store is so Hiker friendly!  They even charged my phone behind the counter because Doc and Chief had the outside one taken. It was difficult, but we finally pulled ourselves away from the picnic table behind the store and back to the trail.  It was enjoyable hiking and talking about their experiences while sharing some of mine and Recons.  We all wished Recon was with us.  He is sorely missed.  It kept thundering ahead of us but we stayed in a protective bubble all the way to the shelter.  All of us filtered water and drank electrolytes drinks, while simply chilling and looking at what lays ahead.  Apparently, the next three to four days are going to be in the nineties. Doc and Chief are thinking of pushing to a hostel for a Nero on Sunday.  I can’t make that pace and instead will probably hit it Monday, if at all.  They decided to get three more miles in and headed on.  I just didn’t think I could gain anything by pushing and actually have a few options for the next three days.  Not killing any miles, that is for sure.  But today easily could have been a zero so I am lucky to be 9 ahead.  Plus, I decided this was a nice place to hang (since the chance of rain is dropping  this evening), good water and a Privy.  I took my time but set up the hammock and tarp, prepared the Bear bag, and took items over to the shelter table to cook dinner.  I barely finished boiling the water and pouring it into the bag when it started to sprinkle.  I moved everything to the shelter, made sure nothing would get wet under the tarp and ate watching a good hard rain.  So glad I stayed put.  Although, the tarp is wet, it will hopefully dry over night.  The rest of me is save, dry and well nourished.  So I am grateful that I am Keeping the Faith!","RPH Shelter

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595736,"The hike this morning had me go around a beautiful lake!  The problem is it’s name - Nuclear Lake!  Apparently a Plutonium Research Facility was located on the edge of the lake until it was shut down in 1972 after an explosion.  Supposedly deemed safe and the AT was allowed to route past it.  All I know is that I hiked by quickly afraid of a huge mosquito carrying me away!  The regular size ones have been crazy since the rain yesterday!  Next I passed the Dover Oak, said to be the largest Oak tree on the AT and well over 300 years old and six foot in diameter.  I guess the Keefer Oak in Va. is just the largest Oak in the south!  Just around Lunch time, I came up to some Railroad Tracks and then realized that this is the Appalachian Trail Stop for heading to NYC.  The only problem is that the train only stops on Saturday and Sundays!  I think that is APawling.  Guess I will have to see my daughter at the end Of this journey.  The train stop is right next to a road that leads into Pawling, NY.  Not needing anything until Kent, Ct., I passed on the town but not a deli .7 miles down the road!  That added 1.4 miles that don’t count to my day!  It was worth it though because I got to taste Prosciutto meat for the very first time.  Enjoyed it but like Pastrami better.  Of course I had Coke, Lipton Tea, and Hershey’s Ice Cream Sunday for dessert. Oh and had macaroni salad with the sandwich roll.  I am going to miss these deli’s!  After lunch I hiked back up the road and through pastures and the sun was boiling me!  I was so happy to get back in the shade of the AT Green Tunnel.  The problem was that the bars and mosquitoes like the tunnel too.  I finally looked at Guthooks to see how much further to the shelter and it said .7.  I couldn’t believe it and toyed with the idea of adding 3-5 Miles to the day.  That plan quickly faded when I came to the next road crossing.  Off to the left was a man sitting in his vehicle.  I figured maybe a shuttle driver for someone behind me.  I waved and walked on, until I heard, “gbolt”!  It was Iceman all the way from Pa. he said he was following the Ultra Runner that is trying to beat the AT record.  Apparently, the guy ran pass me last evening when I was eating dinner in the shelter to avoid the rain.  I wish him luck but I am doing the opposite, deliberately going slower and doing less miles!  Iceman saw yesterday’s journal and knew exactly where I was.  He pulled out a chair and handed me another Coke!  My lucky day!  He also offered me pizza but the sandwich was still digesting.  Lol.  I did end up with a Mt. Dew followed by a Gatorade!  What can I say, it was hot. Oh, and salty chips that I didn’t get at lunch!  The trail magic was extended to three other hikers as well.  90 Days who joked with Iceman that it was going to be 91 if he keeps up the magic!  Then a Canadian Couple.  Soon they sped off for their 6 more miles, Iceman said his goodbyes, and I headed on for my .6 miles knowing I was now done for the day!  Such an unexpected surprise, but so cool to see him again.  Wiley Shelter has SOBO Section Hikers staying the night.  A Costa Rica Couple going down to NJ and a daughter that has joined them just for the weekend and a young couple that are just hiking for the weekend up from New  York.  It is fun discussing the different approach you can take when Section hiking vs. Thru Hiking.  I just think it’s cool that people are out enjoying the trail!  That was what it was intended for and not so much the Thru Hiking that seems to grow each year.  
I have the hammock hung and the tarp high and wife hoping to get a breeze.  It is going to be warm for the next 72 hours for sure.","Morgan Stewart Shelter

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595874,"Woke at 5:30 with the hope of heading into Kent Ct. for some Resupply and shoes, then hiking another 4 miles to make a sixteen mile day.  It didn’t happen!  The heat/humidity and bugs are all oppressive!  The morning was great! I grew up in St.Louis, the Gateway to the West.  So it was fun to pass a sign that said, “Welcome to Connecticut The Gateway to New England”!  I am not officially done with NY because we hop back and forth over the state line for a day or so.  Hiked to a road that was suppose to have a convenient store around the corner.  Wasn’t sure which corner though!  I asked a runner if she could give me directions and also if they have Soda pop?  She instantly knew I was from the Midwest and she ended up being from Pittsburg.  I headed south (the opposite of what I thought) and past a park entrance to the right where a group of guys asked if I wanted to leave the pack there instead of carrying it to the store?  Of course I did! I then past under a covered bridge that crosses the Housatonic River, which was cool.  Soon I was at the store and it had everything I needed for a 2-3 day Resupply to get me to Salisbury Ct. plus a Coke and a Chocolate Milk.   Quick, easy, and cheaper than in Kent, Ct.  very Hiker friendly too.  I was skipping back to my pack and heading north in no time flat.  Then I spent the rest of the morning climbing or at least going up.  It never seemed to end.  When I thought I had crested, it would drop down and then regain that same elevation.  It did this all along a ridge.  Up 300 ft and down 300 ft!  I passed a lady on a natural stone bench.  She wasn’t doing to well in the heat.  
She had water and Gatorade so all I could offer were words of encouragement;letting her know she had about six hours to go three miles and to do it a little at a time.  I hiked on and said a prayer and then about a mile later I wished I had given here some Gatorade Sugar Tabs.  Prayers would have to work though, to many up and downs along he ridge to hike back.  Just about totally drained of energy myself, I hit the first shelter and the one closest to Kent.  A Steep downhill and I was at the Road that leads Into Kent.  First stop was the Outfitter for fuel, bug spray and a Coke on the other side which is an adjoining store.  I got directions to the rest of the town items I needed and started walking up Main Street of course. I was stopped by an Officer that was at the pack drop off sight near the covered bridge earlier.  He was amazed that I came up and over the mountain as quick as I did.  We discussed camping options for the night and I settled on returning to that first shelter and not going any further until a cooler morning.  Although, he warned that tomorrow is going to be hotter than today!  He then pointed me to Sun Dogs shoe store so I could see about new hiking shoes.  I was able to change out my Darn Tough for a clean new pair to try on shoes.  I went with the Solomon’s again, because my feet seemed to like them.  I am into a size and one half larger now and really debated that 1/2 size.  Finally decided to go bigger so my toes don’t jam.  The cost was about the same as I paid in Va. so I was happy with that.  These should get me to Rangely Maine and the. One last pair that should have 2 - 300 miles left for home. I then headed to the visitors center to charge my battery and phone while taking a outdoor shower using a quarter machine.  It’s outdoors but enclosed so it was better than some of the State Park showers I have taken. Of course I leave on my hiking clothes and then take them off and wring them out, so my laundry gets done as well!  I put the shorts back on but let the shirt dry in the sun. The shorts dried quickly as well.  I took a pic of a hiker made of steel that sits in front of the center.  Pretty cool piece of art!  Then I went around the corner for dinner. Linguini and Meatballs in Marinara Sauce!  Better than Olive Garden but more expensive because you don’t get a salad with the lunch size.  The beer also drove up the price, but nothing better on a hot day!  Soon I was headed back to the trail when a husband and wife that were camping up the road, picked me up!  I can’t remember his name but he hiked the Long Trail and is on Trail Journals as well!  People associated with the trail are so wonderful!  It confused him because I am hiking North but headed back up the hill south to backtrack to the shelter.  When I got to the shelter (hot and sweaty, so much for a shower), the lady from the bench was there!  She thanked me for the words of encouragement.  I thanked the Lord for helping her!  She shouldn’t be hard on herself, everyone arriving at the Shelter is complaining about the last three miles!  The bugs were still a nuisance the entire time I set up the hammock.  Now the tarp is high and wide to get airflow for the night!  Only did 12 today and who knows how many I’ll get in tomorrow, but the heat isn’t something I battle.  Like the trail, it will always win!","Wiley Shelter

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596147,"Once again, a hot, buggy, low milage day; but it included a town Resupply.  Woke early and was on the trail at 6:30, knowing the .5 mile climb out of the shelter wouldn’t count on today’s miles but would take time and energy.  Not as bad as I thought and soon I was at Rands View, a spectacular view from a pasture, over the valley, to the peaks of the southern Taconic Range. Great way to start the morning because the climb continued from there.  Near the top, I came across the “Giants Thumb”, a glacial formation that really looks like a thumb sticking out of the ground!  Made me chuckle like the biggest frying pan, ball of yarn, or cars buried on end that
people pass on a family vacation.  Soon I was headed down hill to US Rt. 44 and the town of Salisbury.  But shortly before the road came the 1500 mile marker made of stone and shortly there after, one made out of sticks with a rock to pose on.  I was more emotional than I thought I would be for some reason. I guess the reality of walking 1500 miles sank in a little.  Not much time to blubber though because here came Irish Paul, then a new Hiker named Scoot, followed by  Kingsman and finally, No Filter.  I started the chain of pictures by snapping Irish Paul posed on the Rock.  They all were hiking on, so I may not see them again. I stuck with the plan of a 5 day Resupply to get me to Dalton Massachusetts. I chose towns closest to the AT.  Scoot was heading back to town and so he showed me the way.  He is a flip flopper that start in May in Harper’s Ferry after closing on the sale of his home. He suffered from the heat on Sunday and got off trail.  He hike yesterday and camped last night, but is still fatigued today.  He smartly decided to head back to the hostel.  I was feeling pretty good, although it was mid morning and the road walk to town was heating up.  I saw an Episcopal Church with a Hikers Welcome Sign and the door open, so I used the vestibule as a staging point to leave my pack and charge my battery while in town.  Apparently they have a couple of Town Bears that are know to steal hiker food bags, one while the hiker was napping right behind the grocery store!  Then it was to the General Store for Iron Tablets, followed by LaBonne’s Market.  Easy Resupply and they had tons of Honey Buns for Breakfast!  I drank a Dr. Pepper while shopping and did purchase a Banana for mid morning snack.  They have a great deli but I wasn’t hungry so I grabbed a bag of chips for later. (Had them with my gourmet Ramon Dinner and they made the meal!) Walked back to the Church to pack it all into the food bag.  Then it was across the street for Coffee and a pastry at Sweet Williams Cafe.  Couldn’t get out of there without having a ham and cheese croissant; after hearing someone else order it.  It had a nice air condition sitting area, although I am sure I didn’t smell the greatest!  Oh well, such is the life on the trail.  I returned to the market for bug spray and an Ice Tea.  They didn’t have anything with Deet so I went with the natural oils, which seemed to work this afternoon.  I still have Ben’s in reserve should they get too out of hand (or onto my hand!). Finally, back to the Church to fill up water bottles and pack my battery even though it wasn’t at a full charge.  I left a donation in the Church Donation slot and thanked God for a peaceful place to stage my visit.  Soon I was heading out of town, past a Civil War Monument for the Union men from the town. Big Battles including Gettysburg!  Then past the Cemetery with Graves so old the limestone dates have eroded right up to modern times. If you live there, you are buried in this one spot.  It was nice to get off the road and back into the woods but then came the climb.  Instantly, the sweat started pouring.  I just took my time, stopped often and drank a great deal.  The climb ended at the Lions Head with a gorgeous view from slightly over 1,000 ft.  It’s nice to have a pay off for a long uphill climb!  I passed the two shelters which I planned to use as bail points should the town stop take to long.  I also knew the biggest climb to the highest peak (not point, which is on a nearby, non AT mountain that summits in Massachusetts) called Bear Mtn. It was grueling in the heat and on granite stone with limited tree coverage.  The view slightly south of the summit was nice but to sweltering to linger.  The Summit is signified by a pile of rocks with a flat top.  I was to exhausted to climb that and also knew the downhill was steeper than the uphill had been.  That took time and energy.  I often backtracked to find an easier way to let my self down, especially with the turtle shell on my back that throws the balance off.  I also “tweak” my left hamstring yesterday and could tell it was tight and aching today.  I can’t afford to pull a hammy!  Soon I was to my mid stopping point at the Savage Ravine Campsite.  I should have hiked on another 1.5 miles to the the Laurel Ridge Campsite, but figured it would be covered quicker first thing in the morning prior to another good climb that’s not as big as Bear Mtn and will hopefully be a little cooler.  I don’t think it was in the nineties with heat indexes over 100; but it was still upper 80’s close to 90.  The word on the trail is that everyone is suffering and those doing 20+ Regularly are now at 17+.  So I guess I can’t complain about 10+.  Hopefully, it ends soon and I can get back to hiking higher milage.  I just have to Keep the Faith and Keep HikN^.","Limestone Spring Shelter

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596226,"Late last night, after a text from Doc and Chief, I made reservations for the place they just Nero’d at.  This caused me to wake early and hit the trail for a Nero myself.  Almost instantly, I hit the Massachusetts State Line - 10 Down and 4 to Go!  The milage also means I am 2/3 finished with the hardest 1/3 left to go.  Today was hard!  Climbed up Mt. Race feeling great and was rewarded with a 180 degree view from the Ledges.  Best view for many weeks (IMHO). Next came Mt Everett that is even higher but really no view since the tower was removed in 2006.  It was a brutal climb and I was toast at 10:15 in the morning!  I had drank through 1 and 3/4 Liters Of water and had to make the 1/4 last for another 4.6 miles that I hoped was all downhill.  The downhill was steep and took almost as much time as the uphill.  Finally it leveled, crosses a rod and dropped into a picnic area. At each end of the table wee jugs of water to fill coolers of block ice to replenish thru hiker water bottles!  That magic saved me!  There was a cooler with empty Gatorade bottles but still plenty of Arizona Ice Tea!  Thanks Bonbrake, you saved my 4th!  After a rest stop and chatting with PitBoss (who was on the Mighty Blue Podcast) who had been hiking with his son until a couple weeks back; I felt refreshed and ready to go!  The miles clicked by slowly until I hit a ridge at noon and stopped for lunch. That again boosted me for a long down hill descent. Then it was pastures and Bogs and battling hot sun and mosquitoes.  I finally stopped at a gravel road in the shade to try and re-energize.  It  lasted about a 1/2 mile and a final pasture and bog.  Knowing that only one mile was left, I pushed for the Railroad Tracks and finally Rt. 7 were I texted for the ride into Sheffield for the night.  It was still under 15 miles and I am beat!  Oh, slip number 13 on a simple rock! Luckily more of a hard sit on the butt, but my Rt. Thigh is still sore from the previous slip! Both shoulders/collar bones are raw from the straps chaffing sweat and salt against my skin!  The sweat runs down the legs and my Darn tough soak it up like rain, so my feet are a raw as an outcome of never really drying.  Like everyone reporting up and down the trail, we are ready for the heat to break.  I heard two days in the eighties and the it drops back to the seventies. I can only hope.  It makes it hard on a holiday when everyone is cooking out and spending time with family and a true day off.  But I thank the Lord for a Nero and realize this is just one 4th of July during an Epic Journey.  So I am grateful to have a Coke, showered and getting my clothes washed clean!  Overall, I shouldn’t complain because I still have Faith and am HikN^!","Sages Ravine Campsite

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596399,"Last night I was at Jess’s Treat with  Pacer, Reece who was slack packing and Kodak who was zeroing and waiting on friends.  Pacer suggested we treat Jessto dinner if she would drive us. Since it was the 4th and restaurants were limited, we ironically ended up eating Indian Cuisine.  Actually quite good and similar to trail food!  Jess then drove us to see Great Barrington and for me to see the actual GB hedge and flag that has served as my Google Icon!  I took actual pictures of it and finally know were the photo originated from!   This morning, breakfast was included in the stay and we had scrambled farm eggs!  Pacer decided with the weather forecast to hike my short day schedule.  So Jess dropped us off at the same time and point.  It was a great relaxed stay with her and a good break from trail heat.  Today was suppose to still be upper 80’s and the sweat poured like previous days, although not quite as oppressive. We had one great view for the day and hike through what is called ice gulch; which reminded me a lot of Hocking Hills / Old Man’s Cave area in Southwest Ohio.  Although this may have been deeper and narrower as a gulch. The conversation was great and Pacer validated a lot of thoughts I have had (and I am sure others, as well) on the trail. I hope he enjoyed talking as well.  We were over halfway by lunch time and both chatting about Coke; when wouldn’t you know it! We spotted a hiker (Web-breaker) close to a cooler and a travel camper.  It was to good to be true! Trail Magic that included Cokes, Bananas, BlueBerries, Oranges and Brisk Ice Tea. I ended up not eating anything except a string cheese from my food bag.  We took an hour there and really didn’t rush.  Then we pushed to the shelter. Along the way, Pacer stopped and we both thought we had a little bear, then a stump and finally it revealed itself as a large Porcupine.  I didn’t know it, but they climb!  He went up the tree about ten feet high!  Pretty interesting.  Later we went by a pond but didn’t swim because it didn’t look like it dropped off to really swim out; plus there was no place to sun and dry.  A little later we came to a Beaver pond with a Beaver Dams and sawed trees. Later Web-Breaker told us she came across a Bear there. Finally, we hit our shelter before 3:30. We really wanted to hike another 3 miles but the next sites all had current warnings about an aggressive momma bear with three Sows!  Between that, mosquitoes, and rain forecasted for tonight, we set up in the shelter.  Once again, I am using the hammock as a bivy and although a little warm, I do keep the buzzing away from my actual body!  Everyone is hoping the front pulls through and we can hike low miles in the rain tomorrow before pulling a big mile day (20-21) on Saturday.

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596438,"Forgot to record Slip/Fall #13?  No biggie and becoming a daily habit!  Also met a couple from NE Ohio that are on their Honeymoon and using a Clark Double Hammock. Made me remember I am coming up on 36 years of marriage this Month. I think this couple will do well because they both have gleamer in there eye, a joking way between them and  they work things out together. They are becoming known as the Hammocking Honeymooners. The rain failed to materialized during the night; so it was buggie and hot! Pacer and Web Breaker are early risers; so I was up and out as well.  A mile up, the trail turned onto a road, with the AT sign a little ways up. However, there was an arrow pointing down a small trail to a creek. In the creek was cans of Pop!  Nothing like a Coke for Caffeine.  Next came the Bear problem campsite we avoided.  I took a pic of the sign and hiked on, only to find Bear Cub prints in the mud.  I hiked on a little quicker.  Spilling out onto a second road, I looked to the right and here was a “Trail Stop” Shed that works off of the honor system.  Another Coke and a bag of Potato Chips.  Even the rain starting, didn’t dampen my joy!  Had to hike quick and say a prayer as I hiked through a pasture with Thunder rolling around over head.  Prayers were answered and soon I felt safer in the woods.  It was raining as hard under the cover of trees and the lightning moved on.  I passed a couple that said the hot weather was changing and going to be in the
mid seventies this afternoon!  They stated the rain would end in a couple of hours.  I did slow up because of wet rocks and swamp boards that are so slick.  The trail wasn’t difficult and I hit the turn off for Upper Goose Pond Cabin   for Lunch at 12:20!  Pacer and Web Breaker and I all debated hiking another 8 miles to a Shelter.  If I could have gotten hold of Recon, I would have had a better idea of whether to push on or not; but alas, No Signal!  Pacer doesn’t use a stove so he loves to push for town food and has a reservation in Dalton for Saturday.  He Hiked on!  Web Catcher and I stayed.  The Cabin is great.  Big front porch, downstair great room and upstairs bunk room with thick pads!  I hung the wet clothes, picked a bunk, and then filtered water.  Soon I was off to the “Beach”. It actually was more of a dock area but did have a sandy bottom start to the water.  It had cooled off but the swim removed the sweat and bug spray from my body!  Get great.  Then I just chilled on the wooden dock and watched the Sun Fish swim right up to my toes.  A couple came down and eased a canoe into the water and paddles away.  It reminded me of a typical day at a summer camp!  More hikers have shown up and the bunks are filling quick.  Apparently the Caretakers make Pancakes in the morning as well!  Can’t beat this set up.  Just a nice day to relax and then 17 miles tomorrow and fly through Dalton on Sunday to head towards Mt Greylock.  Just have to Keep the Faith.","North Mtn.

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596592,"Upper GooseI was up and packed so early that I didn’t want to wait on the free Pancakes provided by the Caretakers!  Coffee would have been nice but not enough of an enticement to keep me from my first 17 mile Day since the heatwave.  I actually slept and started the morning chilled just a little.  Boy was that a nice change! The hike today was mainly flat with only about three climbs, if that.  I crossed I90 - The Mass Turnpike; which is always fun to look down on highway traffic flying underneath your feet!  I got a selfie with the AT sign (on the bridge over the Turnpike) just off my right shoulder.  Again, it was signs like this that I first remember something about the Appalachian Trail.  I also walked up to the Cookie Ladies Blueberry Farm.  The blueberries are still green and although she had signs for selling Lemonade and IceCream Sandwiches, I didn’t bother to ring the doorbell.  They are getting up there in age and I didn’t want anything other than to sign the log book and see the iconic place. The AT is aging and numbers are increasing to the point that some of these iconic places well soon go by the wayside.   The rest of the miles went pretty quick and my mind was on home. July 7th (7/7) was the day I went on my first date with my wife and then became the day of my proposal.  So it is always a special day to remember.  Hiking the AT is a selfish act.  I am just fortunate that my wife didn’t ask me to come home in the beginning and didn’t force me to come home in Carlisle Pa., and now is actually telling me I am not coming home until I am finished.  Her Love on my journey has been selfless and Christ like!  It’s strange but because of this transition, she has truly become a big part of this journey!  While I am hiking solo, she is on the trip with me in so many ways and we are on this journey separate but together.  Hard to explain...  The other reason my Mind was on Home was because of my side of the family (brothers - wives and niece, now that parents have crossed over) were having there Summer get together.  I started feeling a little low because of all of this.  However, at the top of Warner Hill with a good view, I had enough of a signal to call my wife.  She passed the phone to each brother and finally my oldest daughter hopped on.  Technology helped me to feel a part of the day.  Once again, hard to explain but it helped boost my moral and helped me hike on.  Soon I was at the shelter enjoying a leisurely set up of the hammock and then dinner.  Tonight’s sleep should be cool and refreshing now that the heat is gone and I am hiking more miles just a little quicker than before.  I just need to Keep HikN^ as my Wife and family say, so on I hike.","Upper Goose Pond Cabin

So quiet and quant, I could have sat there for an entire morning.  The last 3/4 mile the trail crisscrosses the road to the top.  But it still seems pretty isolated and I was glad it was a quiet Monday morning instead of a busy weekend. Finally, the Woods give way to a beautiful sight of the Memorial Tower and the Bulb at the top.  Built to honor Massachusetts Men and Women who had died during the world war.  The beacon, possibly the most powerful light in MA, was intended “to shine each night perpetually, to honor the memory of fallen heroes and to guide aviators in their lone night time journeys over the treacherous mountain range.”  All pretty cool and the. There are the views, not 360 but divided into each direction. North shows the Green Mountains that are my next challenge.  East starts with some far off NH mountains and works towards the
south to include the range I just hiked from.  To the West is New York and beyond. There is also a round diorama with Mt. Greylock in the Center.  It was cool to see yesterday’s hike up and today’s home down.  I walked to Bascom Lodge but it didn’t look open, so I sat at a picnic table and ate a Honey Bun for Breakfast. I had service and received a text from Recon with a possible lunch destination and telling me to enjoy the day. He then mentioned coffee at the lodge; so I entered and sure enough, the restaurant was open.  I simply ordered a cup of coffee in a real cub with a saucer and went to sit down.  Two nice ladies were at a table and the one stated that no one was sitting with them by the window.  They had attended a Jazz concert the afternoon before and then spent the night in the lodge.  When they found out I was hiking the AT, they asked awesome questions, like my favorite part or was it what I expected. The questions made me think and challenge led my brain that sometimes is not really used during the daily challenge of the hike.  It was a pleasure chatting with them and I just hope I didn’t talk their ears off!  So enjoyable sitting in a rustic sky chalet on top of a mountain. Once again, I could have spent all morning there.  But, I had to move on.  Outside, I met up with Fern from Stony Point Resort were he had been nursing a sore ankle.  It was better and he is moving north pretty fast.  Up walked Swimmer from last night.  He had tried to sleep in and hit the lodge restaurant for lunch but couldn’t.  He was over joyed when he found out that there was coffee and breakfast items.  I said my goodbyes and went back up to the monument for one last view.  A couple that overheard my conversation while sipping coffee asked if I would mind answering a few of their questions.  Again, not your typical ones but just a wonderful flowing conversation.  They have a place in the Berkshires and I now know how wonderful a place that is!  I finally started the descent but not until after stopping and viewing row bird watchers view a bird.  It’s cool to watch people do any activity that they are passionate about.  Just down from the Summit is the “Thunderbolt Shelter” built by the CCC in the 1930’s next to the Thunderbolt Ski Trail that was used by Olympic caliber skiers in late 30’s and throughout the 40’s.  It was noted for its dangerous curves and fast pace.  Being a Northmont Thunderbolt, I just
Love it.  Soon enough the AT branches off and my pace slowed on a sore ankle and the steep downhill.  It’s fine climbing and there were two spots were the trail did just that to junction with side trails.  Then,
It would drop down again and I would step gingerly.  At 11:50 I stopped at a view that Fern was snacking at.  It was a great view of the town of Williamstown.  I was tempted to eat lunch but wanted to be at the meet up point with Recon and his wife before 1:30.  So on I hiked, slow enough that Fern passed in a blaze of speed and I hobbled along.  Soon I popped out onto Phelps Avenue and received a text from Recon asking for my location, telling his, and confirming our meet up point.  When finished texting a car pulled up and a man and lady asked if I was a Thru Hiker.  She is reading and seems to be passionate about the trail. They had just been down to the Trail Parking Area and she had been on the trail and seemed very excited about the possibility in the years to come. Awesome to see people that know about the AT.  I headed on down and around the corner to the parking lot and sat under a tree.  Couldn’t resist eating a peanut butter tortilla and the last of my Fritos on top. Soon enough Tom called, confirmed my location and pulled up next to the curb.  It was so good to see him!  Hate the Boot but he looks fit and trim and ready to hike if he could.  It was nice to meet Kathy in person, even though I feel I’ve known her through Recon and face time from early on the trail. They took me through Williamstown, Bennington and then to there house.  I instantly felt so welcomed and made to feel at home that I won’t know how to ever repay them for their kindness.  A shower was first on the docket (as usual for a Nero) and then my clothes were taken away to be laundered. I sat with ice on the foot and ankle and it seemed to help some.  Recon ran to the store and returned with some items to help my stay feel more like home than a hostel or anything else available on the trail.  When he returned we went back to the other house for dinner.  I was shocked at how good vegetables taste now!  French fries are always great and I had both Rotisserie Chicken and Fried Chicken.  Just good food!  Kathy’s Sister swing by with left over salad that was going to go bad and then Harry and his wife came, bringing me a bottled Coke!  They know the way to my heart! It was just a good ol fashion evening around the table with lots of stories!  So relaxing and so strange that I never felt out of place, but like I belonged in this moment at this time.  Finally, it got late enough and morning trail time is early enough that every reluctantly (as my dad use to say) adjourned from the table.  Here I sit with ice on the ankle to finish this post and then it’s off to bed so I can keep this early morning schedule I have.  Planning on a 19 mile day hike tomorrow, so we will see how it goes.","Mark Noepel Shelter

We also both have Recon in common and there are no words to describe what a great friend and important part of my journey he has become.  Heck, my family and brothers all agree that they feel safer when Recon is in the picture verses when I am left to my own vices.  I really think that is somehow a negative reflection on my solo capabilities; but sadly have to agree that he is a game changer. Who couldn’t have a great start to their day with his friend Harry!  Soon enough though, I was off and crossing over Rail Road Tracks via a Handicap and Bike capable bridge and path.  Then up a street to cross and enter what looked like a driveway to close by homes.  However, i soon recognized it as the trail from previous Long Trail and AT Videos.  It is a unique re entry to the woods for sure.  Soon I was chugging along until Massachusetts gave me an uphill of rocks to climb as a farewell gift.  It remained me of Maryland and I did t care for rock piles their either.  I did count my blessings that it was over quickly, unlike Pa.  Before I knew it, I was standing before the sign that said, “Welcome to Vermont” and below that, “The Long Trail”.  Only three states left: Vt., NH, and Maine!  However, I was more excited about getting to hike on the Long Trail, the oldest long distance hiking trail!  The AT and Long Trail are one in the same for 105 miles before the LT goes to Canada and the AT turns to New Hampshire.  Less than three miles later, I got another treat.  Although this time it took me eight days instead of a week, but I did pass the 1600 mile mark. 590.9 miles left. Still not thinking a lot about the ending.  Still seems far away with the Green and White Mountains to hike before I even get to Maine.  The rest of the day was enjoyable.  I can see why the state got the name Vermud, but currently it is fairy dry and well trodden.  At the top of the last hill, I contacted Recon for pick up,
because I was warned that their was no signal at the trail head below.  I then hiked two miles down with the last mile so steep it made me glad I was descending instead of climbing.  My left ankle was aggravated more by that last mile than the rest of the day. Hoping ice works as well tonight as it did last night.  There was a container of Trail Magic at the bottom, so I downed a Gatorade and the. Recon pulled up and handed me a Coke to “support my habit”.  Now that is service.  He took me to a Dollar General in Bennington and I picked up more than what I immediately need for the next three days; but it will all get used, I am sure.  Then I got to see the Bennington Monument up close, that I saw from the highway this morning.  I love history and this was neat to see.  Then a shower and dinner with his father in law Clyde.  It was good to chat with him and was cool that it was just guys.  The salad was awesome and Recon gave me half an avocado to go with it as well!  Who would have thought I would prefer a dinner with avocado over fast food!  The trail has changed me!

So the overnighter was an easy choice to make.  Recon, on the other hand, is ready to hop back on trail at the first chance he gets!  He is truly at home whether on the trail or not.  This being his stomping grounds, he spoke passionately and energetically about “Split Rock”, “a view east for lunch” and my choice of “Goddard Shelter” or the “Lookout Tower”.  I am praying that he gets released by the Doc, prior to me leaving Vt.  It is he hope as well, I am sure.  One prayer I truly hope the Good Lord Grants. The day was as beautiful as Recon said. I can tell I am in the mountains again by the change in foliage and the terrain. It’s not super rigorous climbs yet, but there is now doubt we are starting the Green Mountains.  A mentor Principal once told me that you have to get above the stage and look back down on it to gain perspective.  That’s what the view from the tower revealed. A view showing the miles since Mt Greylock and the
Mountains yet to the North.   Everyone agreed, it was the best View since the Roans.  While setting up a log for dinner at the base of the tower and chatting with Pixie, I suddenly heard my name, “gbolt?”. It was none other than Sassafras!  Finally at the same place at the same time!  It was enjoyable catching up with her while waiting on the sunset.  Pixie and Annie were up on top as well. Orville (from the Wright Brothers) joined us on the tower for the main event.  He just Graduated from Centerville HS! Such a small world.  The sunset did not disappoint.     No cloud in the sky and other than the wind and a chill in the air, it was awesome.  It got shouts of “encore” and applause when it disappeared.  I tried to stay for stars, but the wind drove all of us into the warmth of down bags.  No one is complaining after the recent bout with heat!  There is still joy in each day and most are now thinking of Katahdin and either speeding up or slowing down.  I am still trying to find balance and Keep the Faith.","Rte 9 / Woodford Hollow

Sadly it was locked and they were on a town run. Sad because Recon had sent me up with a box of Chocolate for Jean.  I carried the box back down and to Recon to give it to Kathy and not mention a thing about Caretakers!  Problem was that he had already spilled the chocolate!  After the cabin is the climb up the tower.  An even better view than Glastenbury!  I could see in all directions and knew a lot of the mountains I was looking at.  Best of all, I saw Bromley and the Ski Runs as well as Stratton Pond that was the next Waypoint.  Stratton Mountain is where James Tayler conceived the idea of The Long Trail and Benton MacKaye expanded the concept to the entire mountain range and the Appalachian Trail was born.  Such an inspirational place, it was hard to pull myself down and away from the site.  Fern had caught me by this time and we would play leap frog all day. It was interesting to find out that he had hiked with Sass some in Virginia and also stayed at the same motel in Bennington.  Soon I was bounding along to get to Stratton Pond.  Passed my first Orange AT tagged SOBO!  He says there are a lot coming behind him!  Although, he seems to be making pretty good time on the trail.  The AT arrives at the Willie Ross Clearing on the south side of Stratton Pond.  It is one beautiful spot that a photo can’t capture, although I tried.  I played in the water some but did t go swimming due to the cooler morning hour. Soon I was back hiking in the woods and just enjoying my energy level. It dropped a little and I slowed only to check my watch and see that it was Lunch time. I stopped at a Shelter Junction because the shelter was too far to home just for a picnic table.  I actually should have followed Fern’s lead and hiked one more mile to Prospect Point. As was, I ate and then hiked to the point.  Another picturesque spot overlooking the Gap down to Manchester VT and the mountains forming a backdrop.  I looked at the time and was in no rush, yet I still felt great and really didn’t slow that much. Fern passed me one last time and said he was hoping for trail magic.  I told him if he slowed to 3:30, I am sure Recon can give him something.  He hoped so but thought he would be too early.  As luck would have it, I crossed the road and saw him sitting and chatting with Recon.  After Recon took a Pic in front of the Green Mountain Sign, I joined them and drank down a wonderful Coke.  We swung by the Mountain Goat Outfitters in Manchester so I could get a new headlamp (my Petzle Was Cracked and repaired with luekotape but not reliable), Green Feet / I soles for my hiking shoes and then some dehydrated meals for the future (including a mail drop to Monson).  Hate to spend the money but not much I can do at this point, so not stressing it. Had great Friday night brick oven pizza and a beer while just chilling.  Perfect inspirational and energetic day to Restore my Faith!","Kelly Stand Rd

We have my daughter and son in law and others to help so you don’t have too, unless you want to”. It sounds strange but, I really wanted to do to something different from the trail or even a normal Saturday at home (if there is such a thing). I went with Recon to pick up the Box Truck and then drove his truck behind him.  So strange being behind the wheel after four months. A little rough but I didn’t wreck or damage anything.  It was good to be doing something other than resting or hiking.  Legs are strong, but my upper body strength is gone!  Still so relaxing and actually enjoyable.  Recon joked about sending a video of me vacuuming a rug to Joanie, because I joked about telling her I didn’t know how to operate such a thing!  I even got to grill chicken on a Barbecue Grill outside!  That with Zucchini-Squash-Tomatoes medley, baked potato, sweat corn (that I learned you eat like a typewriter and not circular) turned into a gourmet meal! Today, I could tell I’ve changed and Recon mentioned he was even more chill, when it comes to daily life.   Joanie mentioned going room to room and minimizing our life; when I finish the trail.  I actually think that may be very enjoyable and cleansing in a way!  The Key is “When I finish”; the trail is still there and still in my thoughts even during a Zero.","Shaftsbury

Sort of my uphill mantra, “They that wait upon the Lord, shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as Eagles.  They shall Hike and not grow weary.  They shall walk and not faint.  Anyway, it filled my brain until lunchtime at Peru Peak Shelter, where I chatted with a LT Hiker and another NOBO “Crockett”. He admitted I confused him because he recognized the Franklin NC Outdoor 76 Outfitter bandana on my head but couldn’t figure how I made it from Georgia with the little pack on my back!   I told Recon that I think I have created better hiking habits and hope I don’t slow down or change to much when I put back on the bigger pack again.  Although, after lunch, I was slow passing Griffith Lake and then climbing Baker Peak. The Peak was the third and probably the toughest with a rock ledge leading to the Summit. Surprisingly the views were better on the way up than at the actual top.  From there, I actually made great time down to the Road to meet Recon.  All in all, another Great day!  I did meet three more SOBO’s today, so they are starting to increase in number, although they also say the bubble is well behind them as is the NOBO bubble.  Although most of the people I have hiked with are now a week ahead and attacking the Whites; I am enjoying being in a small void, other than not having my Trail Brother Hiking as well!  Hoping soon that he well start HiKN^.","VT Route 11/30

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597565,"Yesterday’s Zero and Rain increased my desire to hike today.  It was low miles, so I wasn’t expecting the hiking to be too tough.  However, today’s easy sections where tougher than previous days, so in a way, it all evened out.  The rain caused streams to flow and waterfalls to be created. I easily could have been hiking in the Smokies instead of the Green Mountains.  However, an early morning pond made it clear, I was in Vermont.  These ponds are so peaceful and beautiful, one could spend hours in and around the water.  However, soon I was off climbing up to the White Rocks Area that include two ever evolving Rock Gardens.  Tale has it that these are created by gnomes.  I didn’t see any gnomes but the Rock Sculptures and the Views are beautiful. I suffered fall #15 as my right foot slid on a wet root and took out my left foot.  Luckily my pole slowed the fall and let my Rt Butt cheek down a little softer into a bed of pine needles! I thanked God that it wasn’t more serious a fall and that my left lateral knee hadn’t been overstretched. Once again, this caused me to focus a little more for the rest of the day.  I also came to a road and recognized a plant called the poisonous parsley. Recon had warned me about it and Kathy had shown me the blisters, burns and results of it.  It an evasive plant here and is more dangerous than poison ivy!  Soon I had lunch at the Domed Ledge which only offered a tight view mainly up at the mountain across from where I was standing.  Still not a bad lunch spot.  Then it was time to make good time with only one view for the day left.  While hiking I decided that if my Seal Skinz socks came in from Amazon today, tonight would be my last night at Recons House.  It just didn’t make sense for him to drive two hour round trip, to pick me up tomorrow late afternoon, only to drive the same two hours to see me off the following morning (4 hours total). He has already done so much since last Monday in Massachusetts.  I am physically restored from carrying less weight and eating breakfasts and dinners every night.  Not having to set up and tear down camp each night and relaxing, as well as sleeping, in a house has restored me mentally!  I am ready to hit the Main Junction and turn for the Whites and Maine!  However, I well greatly miss Recon meeting me with a Coke daily!  The last view of the day reminded me of home because it’s called the Airport View.  It looks down on the Clarendon Airport, just like a view overlooks the Huffman Prairie back to the Wright Pat Air Force Base.  Still a neat sight.  Soon I was heading down a steep path that leads to Clarendon Gorge and a suspension bridge over the water below.  A local hot spot for swimming!  I probably would have as well, except the rain was caused by a cold front and for once, I was t hot while hiking.  Once over the bridge, I was at the pick up spot, a final day of slack packing completed, because my socks arrived, Recon is out of the boot and waiting for full release, hopefully next Monday, and I am ready to Hammock at night again!  Doing laundry and packing my ULA Ohm tonight in preparation for HikN^ in the morning!","USFS 10

The first hill, up from the road, was no simple climb, passing Claridan Lookout, Beacon Hill and Shrewsbury View.  My MPH slowed almost instantly from previous days!  I did get a little energized when I passed a wood plaque on a tree that read, “Katahdin 500 Miles”.  For the first time I can start counting downwards instead of upwards!  Pretty cool thought!  But then it was back to climbing.  This time it was Mount Killington.   The first 4,000 footer since Roan Mtn. NC!  I planned on lunch at Cooper Lodge, one of the oldest cabins on the long trail; but couldn’t hold out and needed energy  to finish the climb.  I actually ate lunch looking over at the Summit yet to climb.  When I hit the sign stating .2 to the Summit, I should have taken off the pack.  Instead, I thought this could be the first test to get ready for the Whites.  It was quite a test!  Yet, the views were amazing!  I would say they were even better than Mt. Greylock!  On the top I was offered trail magic by a girl that looked so familiar.  Declining the Beer (some would say that’s a first), I listened to her tell two other NOBOs about completing her triple crown and enjoying the AT the most.  Confused, I asked if she was heading North or South now and she said she had finished her NOBO and climbed Katahdin already this year.  Her trail name was Early Bird and suddenly it clicked. We had met her at a shelter just before climbing out of Leighigh Gap back in PA.  She remembered and confirmed it by asking, “Weren’t you hiking with a guy from Vermont!”  So Recon was more memorable than me. That has to be a first!  So she becomes the second person I have met on the trail to finish!  Probably many more to come hopefully!  Soon I was climbing back down off of the Summit.  It was not quite as difficult as I thought it was going to be and I actually made good time.  I was still trying to see how close I could be to previous pick up times with Recon.  I would have been about half an hour to forty-five minutes behind schedule, if I had hike the full 17.7 to the Road.  Instead, I cut my day short and stayed at a Shelter 1.9 Miles up from the road. The next shelter was just over two miles ahead and .5 miles north of the AT.  That half mile makes a mile round trip and didn’t sound appealing at all.  Plus reported bear problems. The next Camp was 5 miles away and would have cost to stay.  I will hit it in the morning for Chocolate Milk I am sure!  The Long Inn at the Trail and Pub with a stealth spot across from it was a hitch or a hike up the road.  Neither sounded appealing so I Filter Water (since I was totally out) and headed to the shelter .1 off the trail. My Left leg is also throbbing like it did the last time I was wearing my pack and going downhill, so I am not sure what that is all about.  Finally, for the first time in over a week, I really missed ending my hike with a refreshing Coke!  Other than that, this first day back on the trail has been a good one!","VT Route 103

Good thing because the mid morning Hill was a thigh burner.  I knew it was coming because I saw a beautiful waterfall called Thundering Falls, that reminded me so much of the Amicalola Falls.  Then I crossed the Thundering Hills Boardwalk that looked up at the Thundering Hills to be climbed.  I barely pulled into Stoney Brooke Shelter by Lunch time after reaching the top.  I almost called it a day but way to early.  I laid back and could have taken a nap but knew there weren’t many options for camping tonight.  So I forced myself onward.  By 3:30 I was at the last water supply and campsite for 3 more miles.  I decided to carry the water and head to The Lookout Cabin.  It’s privately owned but left open for Hikers.  It has a ladder on the outside that leads to a crows nest on top of the roof.  Beautiful Views all around!  I hope to see stars tonight but with 19.2 Miles today, I am pretty well beat.  The main buckle that snaps the top of the pack also broke!  At this point, nothing really matters, except Keeping the Faith and HikN^.","Churchill Scott Shelter

The street had trail magic at two mailboxes.  I had a Coke at one and skipped the second.  Then a jogger stopped and told me about a third house on the right that lets hikers swim in a beautiful pond!  If it hadn’t been raining all morning, I would have been tempted!  At the end of the street was a Carnival / Small Rides set up.  The sausage dogs smelled good and Cotten candy was awesome I imagine.  But I felt out of place with smelly pack and clothes.  So on down the road I went, under I91.  Then to the bridge over the Connecticut River that forms the State Line between VT / NH.  I took the usual selfies but actually was sad to cross into NH.  I had such a great time and really enjoyed Vermont!  However, I am really feeling the pull of home.  Soon I walked up the hill and was thrust into the chaos of Dartmouth College and Summer Camps.  The town was hopping on a Sunday!  There I met up with Highlander and Ski Pole.  Highlander sent a photo copy of the list of Trail Angels that take hikers in and then gave me the list after their accommodations were set.  We all went to a place Ski Pole heard about, called Stenson’s, that has a hiker special for $5.  Great sandwich, chips and Coke! Lunch was taken care of and it wasn’t Tuna on a Tortilla!  I walked the Main Street and stopped off at the Outfitter.  No tips for the pole but I did replace the buckle on the pack.  I debated Gorilla tape at the Hardware Store for repairing my food back that the PCT stick tore a hike in this a.m.  Decided to wait on the EMS store in the morning.  Also have to get my glasses fixed and of course go to the Co Op for a Resupply.  Plan on waiting to hear if Recon gets released by the Doctor anyway, so milage doesn’t matter tomorrow.  I then got ahold of the Trail Angel suggested by Doc and Chief.  She turned out to be an English Teacher with Summers Off!  Their home is beautiful and I have a bus line that runs from every half hour starting at 6:30 a.m M-F.  It is awesome how God is overseeing this hike as long as I trust in him and not question or try to control what is not mine to control!  Hopefully, I can keep that kind of Faith as I Home into the tough White Mountains!","Thistle Hill Shelter

What a view and I had enough signal to call and hear Joanie’s voice!  She makes me a better man everyday and today she made me hike on!  We stopped at Zealand Falls Hut and learned that the trail became smooth and flat for the five miles to Ethan Pond Shelter, which was our original destination.  Once we arrived, I asked a couple of SOBO’s and Recon asked the caretaker about available stealth sites at Crawford Notch.  We found out about possible spots across the road and close to the Saco river.  So on we hiked making an eleven hour day. Still relatively easy for the “Whites”.  It also ended with a cold drink and some grapes provided by “Bear Bait” who is supporting Orville one of the Wright Brothers from Dayton Ohio that I have mentioned meeting back in Vermont. We then crossed the road and started looking for a camp spot.  The site is to close to the road and noisy; but is good enough for one night.  We cooled off and washed up in the river before dinner.  I don’t know what my issue is but last night, I scrapped my head on a branch sticking out from my hammock tree.  Tonight while getting a bear bag hang ready; I pulled a branch down into my head and bled again.  Recon is going to run out of wet wipes to clean these wounds!  He tries not to laugh, but me hanging a bear bag is very entertaining.  Crazy thing was that when I went back to my original branch, everything went up the first attempt.  I think it may be my dad’s fault.  He used to say that a jobs not done until a little blood is shed!  Well today’s job is done and tomorrow I will keep hikN^.  Soon this journey will be over and I will return to my number one journey in life; being married to my wonderful wife!","Garfield Ridge Campsite

Adams.  Oh, during that hike we heard what we thought was a generator building but turned out to be the Cog Railroad!  The second train up the mountain, we captured on video in the fog.  No we did not moon the Cog!  It was quite a hike getting to Madison Hut and we were wiped out when we got there.  We tried to revive by eating our free bowl of soup that comes with the AMC Thru Hiker Campground Charge, earlier in the Whites.  Many complain but it helps pay Caretakers that mainly work to keep the Privy’s in order.  It also comes out to about the same charge as the Smokey Mountains Permit required down South.  The bowl of soup is normally $2 so it’s not that bad of a deal.  The soup was great after battling the wind all morning.  We left the Hut a little after two and started to finish the Mt. Madison Climb.  For the first time, I got frustrated on the trail.  It was well marked, you could see multiple cairns in various directions, I would lose the trail so each foot stop was out of sequence and the wind picked up again to really mess each step up!  Recon didn’t hear me at the time but later was shocked when he found out I cursed!  I actually feel bad for it and losing my cool.  When we dropped below tree-line for the first time in  over 24 Hours, it felt peaceful, quiet  and almost like normal hiking again.  Yet, it was still steep and stepping properly eluded me!  I think we all are a little fatigued physically, mentally, and emotionally.  Tea Time and PeekaBoo has planned on getting to Pinkham Notch and they pulled into camp calling it a day!  Just a hard 10 miles in the “Whites”.  Hopefully, I can gain some spiritual strength and avoid frustration from here on out.  Thunderstorms are forecasted for tomorrow, so we are Neroing into Gorham for a day to recoup before the final push over
the Wildcat Mountains.  At least Recon and I Keep HikN^.","Lake of the Clouds Hut

Arrived at Pinkham Notch Visitor s Center and  I purchased a Coke immediately.  Everything else was way to expensive.  The coolest thing was the Relief Map of the Whites.  Quite impressive to follow the white line showing our hike the past week.  Then outside to wait on the Hostel Shuttle to Gorham. The last two days have been the toughest on the trail; including the Approach to Springer before trail legs.  Now we have the muscles and the cardio but the extreme work climbing, fighting wind, stepping rock to rock and decending have taken their toll. My knees are sore and fatigued!  Needed the day off.  Amazing since I felt so great in Lincoln NH!  I remember running in Hiawasee through the rain and having to go slow and stop at points.  Ran the same distance in Lincoln to get rain pants to exchange at an Outfitter and felt like a super human with great endurance and didn’t stop at all!  Now tonight, I have aged tremendously in just a matter of days!  All will get better as soon as we get out of the Whites.  Tomorrow and the next we do a short 23 miles but they claim the Wildcats may be the most brutal of all the sections of the Whites.  Doesn’t matter because we plan to return to this Hostel for another Nero on Monday.  We have the next Resupply already purchased today to get us to Andover Maine.  Anyway, I just need to Keep HikN^.","Osgood Campsite

Then saw the Carter Hut from above before dropping down to it.  We were moving so well that some young hikers we knew from the Hostel commented on how we were staying up with them even though we had our packs.  Everyone was enjoying the Cinnamon Buns at the last Hut in the “Whites”. Wonderful taste and you could since the sugar and calories.  We also paid a couple of bucks for soup that would serve as our lunch; equally as good as the cinnamon buns.  Soon it was time to get moving again.  However, the trail was no longer allowing us to attack it!  It was as if we got a hit in the morning but we were going to strike out in the afternoon.  It wasn’t all bad, though.  I was listening to a Sunday service podcast on one of the big climbs.  The podcast was making the point that God is Present in our lives.  We don’t have to wait u til we are dead or in heaven or after we clean up our act.  Instead God is here. Which is exactly what I heard as I turned off the podcast so as not to bother others with technology (a No-No on the trail) and as I Summited  Mount Hight (Elevation: 4653). He was present and so was his glorious creation.  Truly Awe inspiring!  Then again, I have Faith that he has walked every step with me and I just needed a little Sunday reminder.   Then it was off to hike the Carters and soon we were once again feeling the wrath of the “Whites”.  One cool thing is that slowing down caused us to be able to chat with some SOBOs.  Today was the first time that we were actually congratulated for being close to the finish.  This caused me to realize that there is light at the end of the tunnel, that we only have one more quick morning in the Whites and in a few days we will be in the last state (albeit a long and hard one )!  Still, I am sensing an actual finish to this hike that I have not sensed before!  Soon I was forced to concentrate again as the “Whites” went for their revenge!  The last descent of the day was brutal and one of the toughest ever. I often sat on my butt and slide, turned around and climbed down backwards and often struggled with the slanted-no grip Smooth rock.  I am not sure I have ever been so happy to see a side trail to the shelter.  However, 1 for 1 isn’t bad and we will finish the Whites with a Nero tomorrow!","Pinkham Notch Rt 16

I ate breakfast sitting on “The Throne” a wooden chair below the shelter that looks out over the western mountains.  Soon we were climbing up to the last Summit; the key word being climbing!  We had beautiful cloudless views of the Presidential’s and Mt Washington from occasional ledges, on our way to Mt Moriah. The AT doesn’t cross the Summit so we dropped our pack for the last .1 mile climb.  Sitting on top, I had mixed emotions.  From Harpers Ferry on, all a NOBO hears is, “Wait till you get to the Whites!”.  They are really hyped up (probably deservingly so) and a major challenge to a Thru Hiker.  Everyone is wondering if they measure up? How tough are they?  What will my milage be? Can I figure out how and where to camp below Tree Line?  Questions very unique to this one section of trail.  Sitting on the Summit, I was bruised and battered but not beaten.  I had the answered the questions and I was now on the downhill side of finishing the Hike.  With Miles still left to hike, we started the long descent down to US Route 2.  I underestimated just how steep and long it would be.  The “Whites” didn’t make it an easy exit.  With four miles still to go, I knew that a 10:00 exit time was unreasonable and that I would be lucky to get out close to Noon.  Two miles from the road, we finally hit a normal smooth trail with leaves!  The type of trail I am use to!  I almost smiled as I picked up the pace, only to be slowed by rocky river crossings and a rocky trail close to the river.  Still, the occasional soft trail made me smile and celebrate just a little.  Finally, I popped out onto the Trail Head Parking Area, glad to be finished but tired and sore!  I was created by a section hiker /Trail Angel named Mike that gave us ice cold Gatorade while we waited for the shuttle into Gorham.  Soon I felt like a New Dollar Bill after a Coke, two Advil and a nice Shower!  However, not really in any shape to Celebrate being finished with the Whites; I have a great deal of Respect for this Section of the AT!

That was to get me safely through the “Whites”.  He doesn’t believe it, but that is exactly what he did!  I wouldn’t have made it to Maine’s without him.  I am sad for him and don’t know the answer “Why?” it is ending this way.  But it is ending and I have to Keep the Faith that Gods will is at work and his eye is on us all.  RTK and I hiked today, thanks to the goodness of Scars and Random shuttling us today (as well as the next couple of days). However, my mind wasn’t in it.  Luckily the trail wasn’t to rugged, the climbs too difficult and the miles too long.  We did come across a hiker named “Chairman” (that RTK knew), who was doing Trail Maintenance with a crew.  They were moving stone and building steps.  We thanked them all, because this trail is truly well maintained in many areas. Every day is hard; but some days are an easier hard than others.   Thankfully today was not as physically hard due to the emotional drain of losing my hiking brother.  Thankfully, the conversation flowed with RTK to keep my mind occupied.  Finally, it was wonderful to be picked up by Tracy and Jeff for another nights comfortable stay.","East B Hill Road

At one point the peace and quiet was deafening!  Soon we stopped for a leisurely lunch, only a mile and a half from the Shelter.  Didn’t matter, today was about rest and relaxation.  We arrived around 1:00 and followed a blue blaze to a campsite along the pond.  Sitting in my hammock, I can see the water thru the pines 25 ft in front of me!   We did our normal chores and got water from a cold stream rather than the pond.  At that point we decided to do a loop Hike following the AT over the pond dam, and to the Pierce Stream Cascades and Waterfall and then around to Harrisons’s Pierce Pond Cabin.  Chatted with Tim (the owner) for awhile and then returned to camp via a blue blaze.  We decided not to spend the money for breakfast at his place, but instead to get to town as early as possible.  Having already hiked the AT section, we will take the quicker blue blaze tomorrow, to get back to the AT and on to Caratunk.  The rest of the afternoon is “free time” and R&R.  If asked what I what to do when I get home, it’s that!  Saturday Free Time.  Wake up, sip coffee, talk to my wife about everything and nothing and then spend the rest of the day as “free time”.

This is a great free service provided by the ATC and MATC. Fording the River is difficult due to dam release causing unexpected high water, as well as very slippery rocks underneath the flow.  They warn hikers not to chance it; and the official white blaze is in the canoe.  It was a pleasant and quick ride to the Northbound side.  Another iconic experience that I was looking forward too and totally enjoyed!  After un-boarding and recovering my pack, we quickly hiked to the junction of ME 201  and Main Street to Caratunk.  We hiked up to the Caratunk B & B and checked in around our expected 10:00.

Except I did almost fall on the descent.  RTK’s foot slipped on a root used to step down.  Watching that, I tried to use the rock instead.  Both feet slipped, I dropped and stumbled backwards and would have ended up on my back; if it weren’t for RTK pushing against me to keep me upright!  Once again, just like that, the journey can end.  After the near mishap, the trail improved and so did our speed. It was short lived as we had a half an hour of Pa. style Rocks and mud.  It was as if the trail was an old dried up river bed.  Unlike Pa. rocks, these ended in nice paving type rocks that showed the wonderful work of volunteer trail maintainers.  Yesterday we meet a father that was maintaining a section up Pleasant Pond Mountain and his son had just taken over the next section to the north.  It was fun to hear them argue over who does the better job!  The stepping stones soon gave way to pretty good trail except for the natural bog areas. We managed to keep the shoes and socks dry somehow. We came to the Bald Mountain Stream and realized our record of not “Fording” a river was coming to an end.  No way to rock hop or use a tree to shimmy across.  Off came the shoes and socks and into Crocs for the crossing.  Safely on the other side, we dried our feet and put back on the dry socks and shoes!  Soon we stopped for a quick lunch and then continued to hike the miles.  We came to the W. Branch of the Piscataquis River that had a rope across to help the fording process.  We successfully made it across and once again stayed dry.  It wasn’t to far up the trail, though, that I stepped on a rock in a bog area.  The foot slid and sunk into the mud and I pirouetted and fell flat on my back! Mud splashing all around me!  This is were I can tell the trail has changed me.  Before this hike I would have cursed continually as I quickly rose to shake the mud off my arms and legs.  I would have shouted out the question, “Why the “F” me???”. Then I would have let it ruin mine and everyone else’s day!  Instead, laying in the mud puddle, I started laughing.  If it weren’t for the gear, I would have taken a mud bath!  RTK soon gave me a helping hand to get up because it is exactly like being a turtle on its back.  As we hiked on, I felt blessed that I hadn’t been hurt and that I have dry socks and clothes to get into when we hit the shelter.  We arrived fairly early in the afternoon and set up inside the shelter for a second night.  No reason to set up in the rain, even if it comes to a finish during the evening.  Tomorrow is a Nero into Monson and then the miles we hike are getting us to Katahdin and the finish, God willing.  All I can do is stop taking mud baths, Keep the Faith, and Keep HikN^.","Bald Mountain Stream Lean-to

He was down to one dog and had a more determined approach to his hiking.  Shaw’s is a great place to get off trail and is packed with Hikers because of their reputation. Poet and Hippichic, thru hikers turned parents of little children, run a great hostel.  Typical Nero day for RTK and myself.  Showered, Lunch at a convenience store known for its pizzas, Laundry and then a look at the on site gear shop.  I picked up an Evernew Water Bottle to use as a Dirty Water Bag to finish the hike. Cheapest option and holds a little more and easier to gravity or squeeze filter than the smart water bottle.  I turned the smart water bottle into a new scoop for low water sources. I set up my tarp and switched the guy lines from the tent stakes to the D-Rings, hoping to save time in the mornings by not having to wrap cordage around each stake. We have to average 17 Miles a day in the Wilderness in order to stay on schedule to reach Abol Bridge and the Birches, so every minute saved will help. While setting the tarp up, I heard a fellow hiker call out “Bobbacanu” to a hiker setting up a tent.  That name rang a bell in my memory from way back to Georgia with Dustin (Now Jinx) and Paul and Amber (Seven and Double-Tap). I heard that the hiker by that name was off trail due to a detached Retna.  I approached him anyway and found out he was one in the same!  Small world!  The best part was that I had a video of him shirtless in the snow at the Ga/NC border that he thought he would never see!  Sent it via email and it seemed to make his day.  The one hiccup of my day was that my Resupply package wasn’t here at Shaw’s.  However, Recon and his wife quickly sent me the tracking numbers and confirmation that it’s is in the mail room in Monson.  So after Shaw’s famous breakfast of eggs, meat and all you can eat Blueberry Pancakes, in the morning, I will hit the P.O. at 9:00 to get my Resupply Box that was put together back in Vermont.

The number made all the difference in finding my box!  I had also created a small package of seldom used items to ship back home to reduce pack weight - maybe half a pound. Happily, I returned to the Hostel and started sorting the Resupply Box into my food bag.  Way to heavy!  Had to revisit the bag later in the day to drop weight by decreasing the number of daily snack bars.  Gave about 12 to 15 bars away to fellow hikers starting with Wild Turkey from earlier in Va. So cool to see people I haven’t seen for hundreds of miles!  Twofer and Thumper also showed up to the hostel. Went to Lunch at White House landing for a sandwich and side salad.

Yet, we knew today was going to be tough and possibly the toughest of the three days to start the HMW.  It didn’t let us down, that is for sure.  We had one stretch in the middle of the afternoon that we made great time! It was short lived, however.  Soon we were descending sideways down along the ridge and then climb up to Rock outcroppings to hike over and then drop back down to give back the elevation.  This repeated itself endlessly the entire day.  It took time and energy.  We hiked a total of eleven hours to get in just under fifteen miles for the day.  Once again, we were blessed with great weather and some wonderful views.  Camping was an issue tonight because of areas under restoration and possibly no camping allowed by the West Branch Pleasant River or the Hermitage (a National Natural Landmark of Old growth white pines).  We stealth .4 Short of the river when we found a water source for the evening.  The other huge highlight of the day was passing the 2100 mile mark!  Hard to believe that these legs and feet have carried me so far.  Some days like today, just by being Tenacious and clinging to Faith in Jesus!  Lunch was interesting because we talked of contentment. Eating peanut butter on tortilla shell for the umpteenth time, we discussed the fact that we were content with the meals and this life and never really wished to be somewhere else.  That is until the last two days.  I am finally to the point of finishing g strong, yet anxious to get back to “the real world” (what ever that is suppose to mean) and apply the lessons learned from this journey.  One of those lessons is being content with each day and not fighting for more money, prestige, more expensive stuff but instead trying to be more Christ-Like and build strong relationships with those places in our lives.  Enough Preaching...we are hoping tomorrow is the last of the tough days and yet trying to get in seventeen miles.  We climb the last major mountain before Katahdin - White Cap Mountain.  It offers a view of the Big Mountain if it is clear day.  My first view!  Less than 85 Miles to go (84.6 to be exact) as I Keep HikN^.","Long Pond Spring Lean-to

We climbed up four peaks: Gulf Hages Mountain, West Peak, Hay Mountain and the last big mountain till Katahdin - White Cap Mountain.  White Cap is the highest peak in the Hundred Mile Wilderness Region and offered us or first View of Katahdin!  The end is literally in sight albeit 68 Miles away.  RTK and I knew today was a huge day physically and psychologically to get us through the Hundred Mile Wilderness and able to Summit Sept. 1st.  A lot later than the ultra runner trying to beat the Supported FKT.  He ran past us while we ate lunch at the base of Hay Mountain. Wishing him well, but that is a totally different experience than our journey.  The trail was fairly well maintained and even had steps in numerous places that greatly helped the climbs and descent.  Our only issue came at the end of the day, trying to push the last four miles.  Numerous trees down that forced us to squat or even crawl underneath only to hit another to climb over. Root were still crazy for certain segments and it just seemed to exhaust us as we tried to finish before 6:00 p.m.   A long eleven and a half hour day!  Granted we did take breaks and pics at the top of White Cap.  Also, chatted with Gregory and Firefly, who have been leap frogging is for two days now.  The camp has numerous section, SOBO’s and a few NOBO’s, so it will be interesting to see who stays on schedule and Summit’s with us.  We are a few miles in the hole and hoping to do some 18-20 mile days, if the terrain eases up as everyone says it will.   I hope so.  My knees, feet, and back are showing the strain of this hike.

We started the day with a climb up Little Boardman Mountain. Small and not major elevation, but I just wasn’t feeling it today!  Sore throat, chaffing issues, and tired sore knees.  Even the pack seemed off.  At the top we had signal and I got great news in a voice mail from my daughter.  RTK was able to chat with his wife to ease tension on our Summit Day.  We also have a place to stay in two nights, at the Abol Bridge Campground, just 34.9 Miles away.  I then got some Vitamin I from RTK and said a prayer to God and soon felt like I had turned a corner and was ready to hike.  We stopped early for lunch after finally hitting the best section of pine needles on the AT. Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to is old and may leak but what a great spot overlooking cascading falls that end in a nice swimming hole.  If only we were there at dinner not lunch; so we headed on. We made great time and soon were at Antlers Campsite, a popular tent site on the shores of Jo-Mary Lake.  We took advantage of Verizon coverage there as well!  Soon we headed on to a second Sandy Beach at the North Shore of Jo-Mary Lake.  Getting there, the trail got rough and I hit a wall after crab crawling under a fallen tree.  So when I saw a perfect hammock spot, I relaxed, knowing I was set for the night!  I quickly changed into clogs and took off my shirt to go for a nice cool swim!  So refreshing and Laundry is done at the same time!  Then I set up camp while RTK, Gregory, and Firefly set up on the sandy beach.  While cooking dinner, a brief shower moved through.  I switched to tarp mode but it was over quickly.  It created a spectacular light show in the clouds to the north of us. Once again, we all took advantage of Verizon cellular and I got to talk to Joanie and Alicia for a few minutes before dark.  Now we are all tucked in and thinking of getting up in a couple of hours to see the stars.  Who knows for sure, I am pretty tired.  Yet I am inspired to Keep HikN^ because Katahdin is exactly 50 Miles from where I am sleeping tonight!","East Branch Lean-to

Everyday is tough out here.  Looking at the profile, we thought we could pull off a 20 mile day with relative ease.  The profile is deceiving and we are totally exhausted from the length of the journey and time on the trail away from home.  Shear tenacity and Gods strength is all the pulled us through another eleven hour day.  It started smooth enough with an easy Camp breakdown at the beach and a little uphill to the lean-to we stopped short of last night. Then a little further we got a great view of Katahdin in the rising Morning sun, looking North across the Pemaduncook Lake.  Once again driving the fact that we truly are within sight of finishing. Then the trail went crazy on us! Climb uphill over rocks and roots to move away from water, then right back down to the water! Back up, then down; stumbling over Roots and Rocks.  Muscles rebelling because of fatigue or maybe this crazy terrain is forcing us to use different muscles than in the past.  All I do know is that we were wiped out by Lunch.  We took full advantage of the break because  up next was the Nesuntabunt Mountain.  The climb went fairly quick and easy as we listened to the 100 Episode of Mighty Blue on the AT. At the top was a view of Katahdin Straight ahead, although the peak was in the clouds.  Met to nice ladies that hiked up there and were staying at a Camp Lodge down below. Feeling good again, we took off only to face the same frustrating trail from earlier!  Rocks, Roots, and curving trail up and then back down!  Just totally exhausting, physically and mentally.  Hot Humid day to top it off and we heard thunder clapping in the distance to let us know that afternoon storms were on their way.  We finally hit our targeted Lean-to at 5:35 in the afternoon.  Set up camp, went to the river to get water and started to prepare Mountain House Spaghetti.  Suddenly the Lightning streaked overhead followed by instant thunder.  Yet we were safely inside the Lean-to nice and dry.  God has spared us a couple of times this week and with the trail not being to our liking, we praised God for the Weather.  Good meal and now in the hammock resting tired legs and sore feet!  Maybe the 15 miles to Abol will finally be a breeze...it doesn’t matter, because it will be nice to get a Coke, Shower and be on day closer to Summiting!  Just have to Keep the Faith and Keep HikN^.","Sandy Beach 2140.9

Today we exited the Wilderness!  It was still a rough day of roots and rocks, ups and down.   Not as horrible as yesterday but also not as many miles.    We filtered water from a piped spring that flowed into Rainbow Lake.  Surprisingly, this may have been our last morning of cold spring water.  While not as good as the previous two mornings, it was still refreshing and something I will miss a great deal when off trail.  We had one climb up to Rainbow Ledges but the clouds ruined any chance at viewing Katahdin or other mountain ranges. We still stopped for lunch at the last lean-to in the HMW called, Hurd Brook Lean-to.  Four NOBO’s hiked by and their plan was to stay at Abol Pines and hike the 15 tomorrow and Summit the next; a day prior to us.  We really feel like we are in a bubble and will not have too many that Summit September 1st.  Most are going before this Labor Day Weekend because of the Katahdin 100 Ceremony.  This is a spiritual pilgrimage of the Penobscot Nation to the Mountain that was part of their territory for millennia before the AT ever existed.  We couldn’t avoid the date, but this journey has become a pilgrimage of Faith for us; so we will understand and respect what is happening at the Katahdin Springs Campground. After lunch we only had 3.6 miles to Abol Bridge, yet the trail was still rocky and roots. I remember a SOBO saying his feet never touch the ground the entire 100 miles and I now know what he meant!  When we finally hit the Southbound Warning Sign about food and preparation for the one hundred miles, we were overjoyed that it was finished!  The trail instantly became smooth to the Golden Road that quickly crosses Abol Bridge. As soon as you are on the Pedestrian Walkway, clearing the trees and over the West Branch of the Penobscot River, you look left and suddenly Katahdin is right there! A mighty mountain rising up  and blocking everything in site.  The knifes edge on right side and the Hunt coming up from the left heading north. It was still encased slightly in clouds but we visited the bridge three more times for better and ever changing views.  We are in a Bunk Cabin (by ourselves) that holds six people in three bunks. While checking in and picking up a few items like Soap, Gold Bond, and Vitamin I, we meet Handyman’s Parents.  His dad was so proud of him, even more so when RTK told him what a challenge this trail is and how what his son was accomplishing is huge; you could see the pride in his eyes.  He then provided us trail magic beers before they drove off!  Treating this like a town stop, we showered, dried out cloths and gear and sorted food to cover the last two days, for the last time.  We repaired RTK’s air mattress after tracing bubbles to the two holes that showed up after four uses.  I let him borrow my neoair last night, but am worried that I will need it one last time in the birches.  We are hoping the repair works so he gets as good a nights sleep as he did on my mattress last night.  We splurged for a dinner at the Abol Cafe I stead of trail food and also had plenty of great local ice cream before dinner and as desert.  This is one thing we both will miss being able to consume once we are off trail. As I lay down to head off to sleep, it is hard to believe that I have been on the trail for 169 days!

It was a near perfect day from the moment we made coffee and walked to the bridge; all the way to relaxing in The Birches for our last night “in the woods”.  Morning coffee was prepared and carried to the bridge to see the sun rise and hit the mountain.  Breathtaking!  Just Breathtaking!    We talked and shared the time with Lotus and Firefly who hike earlier than we do but have the same Summit Plans.  We then picked up our packs and went to the restaurant for the free breakfast.  Nothing fancy in the buffet, but filling and free!  The hike in started with registering as number four and five to have a camp spot tonight (limit of 12). The trail in was 90% smooth and only about 10% rocks and roots, instead of the other way around as in the HMW. We followed a beautiful stream, then another branch off of it. We stopped at the falls called, “The Little Niagara and The Big Niagara”.  Beautiful falls with lots of rushing waters.  Could have sat for hours if we had the time.  We continued north and when passing a few other day hikers, it felt surreal when being congratulated for coming all this way from Springer. It has been a long journey!  170 Days as of today; although chasing this dream has been a lifelong endeavor. After the Summit tomorrow, I would suggest that everyone needs to dream and hopefully a window of opportunity will open for the dream to become reality.  I am grateful for my opportunity and the support of my wife, friends and family and everyone reading this, that may not even have any concept of a Thru-hike.  In reality, looking back over the past months, I didn’t realize just how brutally challenging every single day would become.  Recon used to say, “If this was easy, everyone would be doing it and what fun would that!”  In a Log book just a few days ago, a hiker wrote, “The only day on the trail that is easy is yesterday!”. The physical, mental, and emotional challenges test, strengthen and invigorated me while causing daily exhaustion! Spiritually, I grew in Faith more than I can even put into words; so close to finishing this Journey.  I know I couldn’t have done this without God the Father watching over me, God the Son walking with me, and the Holy Spirit stirring within me the entire 2,190.9 Miles.  Many are naysayers, but the Trail Magic, coincidences, the trail providing exactly what’s needed, the views, bad weather, good weather, falling safely, staying injury free, is not something within the trail.  It goes way beyond the trail, beyond this life and this limited time on earth. Many moments, I would hear a God whisper, catch a view, or speed up/slow down at just the right time to experience a special moment as I hiked my hike, that anyone else a minute earlier or later would miss on their hike.  At that very moment, all I could think say or focus on is “How Great Thou Art”!  Sitting by the only fire I started the entire trip, watching the flames dance, I eagerly await the morning sun!

The Last Day turned out to be the longest.  Started at 7:35 a.m. when RTK’s wife Cheryl drove in to Katahdin Stream Parking Lot and we headed up the trail to complete 5.2 miles (one way). It ended over twelve hours later, with my one and only night hike on the AT, at 8:00 p.m.  The day went exactly as the Lord had planned and was perfect from the great weather, great hiking temperature, no wind, and a perfect Sunset as we finished the descent. It was a much more challenging hike than I ever expected.  The Hunt Trail has a little touch of the entire AT from Bridges, to water falls, to Rocks and Roots, to technical climbs with rebar, all culminating in Baxter Peak Elevation: 5,267 ft.  I also had a final lesson on Trust, Faith, and Love.  Cheryl has a fear of heights; yet was bound and determined to support RTK, yet not interfering in our Summit plans (which we had none).  If a person has a fear of heights, the last thing they should do is climb Katahdin!  Yet here she was, trusting the Lord, overcoming her fears, and pushing her comfort level to new heights!  She was a true trooper today.  I have hiked for 171 Days now.  This was her one big day!  She worried about distracting us, but truly added to the experience.  I also have great Summit pictures because of her and the way the time at the sign occurred.  It was a crowded day so there was a slight wait as others finished their moment.  All were day hikers; as our fellow thru hikers were already descending such as Yoshi, Lotus, Firefly, Savage, Poe and after us came Achilles. When it was time, I walked forward, kneeled and said a prayer of thanks!  Then I climbed on the back side of the sign - left hand holding poles and showing the number 3 (for I am Third) and the right pointing to Heaven. Tears of joy, elation, and gratitude mixed in with an unbelievable sense of relief after completion of an Unbelievable Journey and the ending of a Dream.  Hiking away from that moment at the pinnacle of the Trail, I was still in “Thru Hiker Mode” though. Still thinking of the 5.2 Miles down.  Still missing Recon.  Chatting with RTK and Cheryl as if we were going to be heading to another spot on Guthooks tomorrow.  The descent took concentration and that was a great thing!  It kept me focused and free from dealing with the onslaught of questions my mind jumps to if I let it.  Questions such as, “Why did I do this? What does this all mean? What have I learned? Why was I so lucky to finish the trail relatively injury free?  How have I change? What’s Next?”.  All questions I will answer in time, except maybe the “Why?”.  I am not sure I Well ever be able to answer that.  In a way, if I never answer “Why I Thru Hiked the AT”; maybe I never leave the trail or the trail never leaves me!  I didn’t get to sleep until 11:00, well past “Hiker Midnight”. Still woke this morning at 5:15, ready to hike again; but no trail.  Only a pathway heading me back home.  Where’s home? Wherever my soulmate, my children, my family, friends and community are gathered in a spirit of togetherness!  Oh, by the way, the AT passes through there as well!  So I guess I just have to “Keep the Faith” and “Keep HikN”.","The Birches

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602576,"I woke up this morning and realized that one week ago today, I was eating breakfast at the AT Cafe in Millinocket, ME., Post Summit Day. After, 171 days on the AT, time has no meaning anymore.  Last Saturday feels like ages ago and yet still dominates my mind.  Adjusting to the “Real World” is harder than putting in the daily miles on the AT.  I got very use to simply following White Blazes until the set daily stopping point was reached.  The pace became very comfortable and allowed for the mind to wonder in various depths of thought. That has been the challenge for this week, focusing my thoughts to match the pace of life, off the trail.  Things move so much faster!  It is as overwhelming as the flood of emotions on Katahdin; yet not as easy to process.  I am forever changed, yet cannot explain how I have changed.  I no longer work a plan for the day; instead choosing to allow the day to unfold.  Dressing daily is an issue because, other than hiking pants and shorts, none of my clothes fit.  I bought one pair of Blue Jeans to get me through the next week or so.  However, with my appetite and lack of exercise, it shouldn’t be long before I am back to my normal weight (and hopefully not more).  I did Hike 6 miles on Thursday and it felt good for the first five miles.  However, my feet are still numb and have no padding so they are very sore and painful.  My entire body aches at times, letting me know I pushed it for 2,190.9 miles.  I watched a few you tube Summit Videos this week and am shocked at the difficulty of the Hunt Trail as well as the rest of the AT through 14 States.  Once again, I underestimated the Physical, Mental and Emotional challenge of a Thru Hike.  It is the toughest challenge I have ever personally chosen to undertake.  Yet, I realize that self reliance, personal drive, or will power does not guarantee success!  Instead, I now more fully understand and rely on a Bible Passage that a dear friend put into my Guestbook. 
Proverbs 3:5-6 - ""Trust in the Lord with all your heart; and lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct your paths.”
Post Summit, this is what I am trying to do as I return home and move past my AT Journey and follow the next path forward.  I now know that we must “Keep the Faith Thru all Life’s Journeys!  Finally, I am filled with Gratitude as I reflect on all that shared in this Journey with me!  I feel so blessed as I continue to reflect on being a member of the AT Class of 2018.  However, this needs to be addressed at a later date, in a final entry post.  Until then, Keep HikN.",,View Entry,"Sep 09, Sun",0

I am sure that is one of the reasons why Trail Angels exist and provide aid without much fear.  People like Penny, Iceman and others, amazed me, as they walk a fine line between their world and the thru Hikers world.  So many mental and emotional factors that will continue to take time to sort through as I physically move closer to my Pre Hike status. I now have had a wellness check up, Bloodwork, and X-ray (right hand from stopping so many falls, lol), which shows that I am far from being a Zombie.  I have gained back 20 of the 36 pounds lost.  I just hope I can stop the gain at least at my departure weight instead of my “normal” pre pre-hike weight.  A gym membership for strength is on the docket and more likely to occur than 10-15 mile a day hikes!  Don’t get me wrong, I am still hiking but it’s back to 2-3 times  a week and not mountainous climbs!  Psychologically, I still have some figuring to do as I have come to realize my Dream Of Hiking the AT has come to fruition.

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605079,"After hiking back down the Hunt Trail from Mt Katahdin on September 1st, I have struggled daily as much as I did while thru hiking the AT.  As my previous journal entries have shown, I have struggled trying to return to life - post trail. I was now a Zombie, walking (more like hobbling) around the house, trying to accomplish something as worthwhile as “daily milage” and replacing the routine that had occurred for 171 days.  In my mind, I was failing miserably! I was agitated and stressed without any provocation.  Outside stimulus was so overwhelming that it caused me to shut down and appear to be quiet and reserved; the opposite of the real me.  I needed to find new challenges but was too tired and sore, coupled with an inability to focus, causing me to withdraw from anything beyond home life.  Yet Home Life was not like “Home Life on the Trail”. Many claim that this is common and label it, ""Post Trail Depression”.  However, I didn’t feel like I was depressed.  I don’t feel being home was negative or I wanted “out”.  Just the opposite, I was so happy to be home and with my wife, family and community.  Yet, it also wasn't positive, because I didn’t feel like myself but felt..well Lost!  Not sure of who I was, what was the “normal” me, or what I was to become now that I had accomplished my ""Dream of a Lifetime"".  I was no longer the person I was six months ago and I struggled with who I was to become after such an epic journey. I was most frustrated by my inability to put into words or actions, so many lessons learned from the trail.  I also was frustrated by knowing that I wasn’t depressed but also wasn’t returning to “normal life” like so many I hiked with.  I was smart enough to not judge my experience against theirs or place my “return to civilization” on a time line.  Slowly, I was getting back to “normal” according to my family and close friends.  Though, even that frustrated me because I wanted a “new normal”, enlightened and changed from this epic journey!  “Conflicted"" is the best term for what I felt and I suppose many others feel the same after completing their hike, but most do so secretly. The topic of post trail life doesn’t surface with other thru hikers, because the conversation immediately goes to the great moments and memories from the trail not the struggle off trail! - post life is/was causing.  I do know those hikers that return to “something” are much better reacclimatized to life than those of us that have nothing new to return too.  I retired over six months prior to the trail but daily life was spent preparing for the Hike.  So I returned to retired life that had never been previously established.  Don’t get me wrong, time needs to be taken in order to recuperate from the physical toll taken by the body on this challenging thru hike. Thirty days ago, I joined a gym and started doing the 30 minute circuit to rebuild muscle; especially upper body and chest strength.  Strangely, I enjoyed the gym more than the weekly low mile cardio walking, and felt it was time well spent.  I also was able to gain back weight in a healthy slow, controlled method.  Losing close to 40 lbs total, I didn’t want my weight to rebound and end up higher than when I left.  In summary, trying to recover physically, emotionally, intellectually, and spiritually is a difficult undertaking after a thru hike.  An undertaking that was taking a great deal of time for me to navigate and reestablish a new post trail life. Yet, all I could do was simply Keep the Faith.
Then something amazing happened!  I received an email from a MetroPark Levy Campaign member, asking if I would participate in a hike to raise awareness, increase voter numbers and help pass a Levy currently on the ballot.  It was labelled Issue Six…so I was one of 6 hikers hiking for issue 6.  It did sound crazy to me at first.  Hiking 125 miles over Seven Days, Six Nights and not even using trails, but instead road walking to connect 18 different parks spread around our entire Greater Miami Valley area.  The longest milage day was 24, the lowest was the last day at 7 miles.  Carrying packs and Vote Yes Signs, that instantly caused the return of the oder that hikers are known for.  Repulsive yet strangely familiar and calming.  We hiked through rain, sleet, storms and sunshine! Feet blistered slightly and numbness increased quickly; yet, just as quickly, the muscles of the legs hardened and strengthened.  I felt the return of the pleasure from the daily miles; even though hiking through urban area’s versus true wilderness natural area’s.  It was still wonderful to see the city skyline from different angles, changing tree colors and living stress free.  It was wonderful to be honked at as awareness of our Metro Trek increased each day.  A hot evening meal was provided, so the hike was supported by Trek Angels and made the day end on a high note!  Like on the trail, the only shower and laundry occurred day four of the hike.  Just long enough to get the funk and enjoy the warmth of water to wash it away.  There was no Katahdin, but the last mile ended with a group of people applauding the conclusion to our Metropark 2018 Trek!  Then it was on to the Election Building for early voting.  Finishing with a final meal for the Metramily that had formed!  All of us, experienced AT and or PCT Trail Thru Hikers, myself being the newest member!  Everyone appreciating each other and sharing the emotions that hiking illicit.  
In the end, I am suddenly in a better place than at any time since touching the sign!  I have a better understanding of the endomorphines that flood the brain with activity and truly impact our perception of life.  I have a better balance and control of “me” the Thru Hiker and “me” off trail.  I would suggest a one week post trail hike to any that seem to struggle after leaving the AT.  It worked for me!  Finally, I am slowly moving from Pre Trail “gbolt” to post trail “gb”.  My brain is mulling over a part time return to a job, future endeavors and dreams, that do not currently include hiking long distance trails, and remaining open to opportunities that cannot be seen in the present moment.  I just know that no matter what, I will Keep the Faith and Keep HikN the Long Way Home!",,View Entry,"Nov 04, Sun",0

2018 was my first full year of Retirement and of course my Appalachian Trail Thru Hike!
The number 8 is really great and I am a little sad to see 2018 come to an end; as well as this journal.  However, this journey was more than I could have ever hoped for!  Every great memory leads to another and another!  Every photo causes an emotional reaction followed by another then another. Most of all, I am forever changed by my fellow 2018 AT Hikers that continue to message and share the highs and lows of the trail.  Recon and RTK never really leave my thoughts.  I would have never Summited Katahdin without these two men becoming a part of my journey.  I am indebted to them as well as all the Trail Angels, along the way, for becoming a part of my AT story.  One that will be revisited whenever my 2019 Hiker Yearbook arrives in February! A pre ordered  / Christmas gift from my supportive wife!  I so appreciate her and my extended family.  Finally, I would be remised if I didnt thank you all for following this journal.  I am old school, so writing my thoughts and journaling this trek, provided me a greater understanding of myself and this wonderful Path through fourteen states.  I actually thought I would Vlog, but quickly learned that that wasn’t my media and better left for those a little younger and more technologically savvy!  Now that the Year is at end, what does the future hold? I really can not say. I do know that I am forever linked to the AT and am enjoying the emerging 2019 AT hopefuls.  While I know some of what they are in for, each person is unique in their travel and each will have their own story to live out.  It is fun to see their gear choices and excitement as they finalize their departure date.  I added only one item to my kit that served as my - “if I knew then what I know now” item.  That being “The Packa” Rain Jacket-Poncho-Pack Cover; a Present from Santa! (Or was that from my awesome wife again?). I also am in the process of washing my ULA Ohm Pack and am preparing to send it back in for repairs and reconditioning.  Chris at ULA is awesome and is going to see what can be done to get many more miles out of a pack that now has sentimental value!  It actually already looks and smells a lot better after a couple of washings.  I have a feeling that this is occurring in order for me to backpack some more in the future.  Do I see a long distance hike in the future? Not really but that has more to do with not wanting to spend so much time away from home.   However, I am starting to get the itch to hike and sleep outside!  Strange I know!  I believe the urge is going to get stronger; especially as I think about attending trail days as well as contemplating sections like the Roan Mountains or even the Shennies that didn’t have the greatest weather or their normal spectacular views,  as I hiked thru.  Who knows, I am even starting to wonder what the process is to become a Ridge Runner!  Maybe even some trail maintenance; although my upper body strength still isn’t the greatest. I am sure I am not alone.  It seems that once called to the AT, many are compelled to Pay if Forward one way or another!  I just know that no matter what, I am looking forward to what 2019 has to share and shape me!  I know for sure that I will continue to...
