Chris wanted to get to Gramton Gap Shelter for an 11 mile day. I was considerably slower than Chris so I lagged behind most of the day. I apparently wasn't clear on how to read signs. It said there was a path to a not reliable spring and the Grampton Gap shelter was .25 miles away. I assumed it meant on down the AT. I should have turned there. I kept going for more than an hour until I found 5 guys coming South. I asked them and I had to turn back to get there. I went South about 15 minutes and decided this was stupid. I called Chris and told him I would stealth camp and meet him in the morning. I set up camp and am now warm on my hammock and about to go to sleep.,"Harper's Ferry

At least we had the sense to not go out in it. The forecast for tomorrow seems less harsh. If it looks good, we both will go on to Cove Mountain shelter. Someone asked me why I sent my alcohol stove home. The main reason is I got jealous. There were several people using these JetBoil Stoves and they were so fast and easy to light and control. My alcohol was hard to light especially if my fingers were cold. Sometimes I had to put in more alcohol to get the water to boil. It was a pain, so I ordered a new stove from Amazon and picked it up when I got to Ironmaster's Hostel. I am very glad that I did it too.","Darlington Shelter

Optimist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562161,The picture is the view from the Knife's Edge overlook. It's a little hazy but a pretty good view. The approach to it and the way off was a massive pile of huge rocks and the trail followed the highest part of that pile of rocks to the top and down the other side. A fall from there would result in serious injury. I slack packed today and after I decided that today would be my last day on the trail. I have been hiking for 6 weeks. I completed 10% of the trail. I am in better shape now than I have been in 30 years. I lost over 30 pounds. My feet are sore but still in good shape. I will probably never get up to the number of daily miles I would need to complete the trek in 6 months. I have met some wonderful people. Seen things I will only have this one chance to see. Enjoyed the adventure of testing myself against some of the elements. Proved I can do OK out here even at 70 years old. I lasted longer than a lot of people who give up the trail. I may be back someday.,"Palmerton, Pa.

Optimist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572892,"I started in Harper's Ferry today at 10:00 am. I arrived at the David Lesser Shelter at 6:00 pm. 2/3 of the hike was hot and muggy. Then a thunderstorm came through and it rained for about 45 minutes. It was cooler hiking in the rain. It looks like I will be alone in the shelter tonight. It's pretty nice. Well maintained with a separate shelter for the picnic table. I met some thru hikers today. They started in April and are close to half done. I think tonight will be comfortable. The sun is out and it's cooler now. I can hear an owl hooting to the West of here so I won't be completely alone. I'll probably do a shorter day tomorrow. The reason I did almost 10 miles was there was no water available before here. Although, there was trail Magic a few miles back of large water jugs and fruit. That was perfect. No picture because I couldn't get it to load without an error. I'll try when I have a better signal.","Harper's Ferry

I just found 2 likely trees and set up my hammock. Since I am on top of the ridge, I should get a nice breeze tonight. I'm not planning on rain but I am ready if it should occur. I stopped at Blackburn AT center for lunch. I got water and cooked at their picnic table. It's a nice place and I'm glad I stopped in for a visit. They were offering ice tea, lemonade and cupcakes. They have rooms hikers can rent but I kept hiking. No rain today but I got wet from sweat anyway.","

He walked to a stream I was near, got a drink of water and continued on like he never saw me. I got into the Roller Coaster today. That is 13 miles of puds (pointless ups and downs). I got to Bears Den Hostel where I was able to get a shower, bed, ice cream, laundry, pizza, and can make my own pancakes in the morning all for a grand total of $30. It's a nice place, an old stone home built in the 1800s as a Summer home for a D. C. doctor. The AT runs it now.","
