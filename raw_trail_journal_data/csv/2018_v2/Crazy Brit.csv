Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569375,"Hi there as you can see from  my trail name I am English ,but at the time I start on my Thru hike Iwill have been living and working in the USA for the past 25 years, I will be 70 years old at the start and have always been pretty fit and agile being a Sailboat rigger ,Mast builder and Boatbuilder all my working life starting at the young age of 15 years as an Apprentice Boatbuilder in Plymouth Devon in England.
I have always liked Walking and the outdoors also fishing in the Sea ,River and Lakes this gets me out into the nature world,Iam also a keen Photographer , I intend to make a interesting Journal with lots of Photos,both good times and Bad, I will also have some fishing line and bits and pieces, as its always hard for me to pass a river lake or pond without just getting a line wet.
All though I live in Bradenton Florida i can get in some good hiking tho there is a distinct shortage of those hill things I have heard on the grapevine that the AT is not short on these , I have a rock pile i climb up and over also steps  at our local Carpark, have also joined our local gym and making the most of their equipment.
As always there is a black cloud in my preparation in that i have been diagnosed with Arthritis in my Big toes, as I am going to need these my doctor arranged for me to have Cortazone shots ,This was the most painful thing i have ever had to make things worst they never worked , so I am having Acupuncture on my toes and this is really helping , I am back to walking 8 miles every morning  just to get them worked up , we will be going up to North Carolina in August for a week so i can walk a bit of the AT , also my local hiking store Trailwalkers here in Bradenton are putting together a AT hike in October, so will be able to test some of my gear that I am getting together , a list will follow shortly.
I look forward to getting all the equipment and am being Mentord by a friend who competed a thru hike in 2015 name of Dan Caruso  trail name "" Uncle D""  and another friend David Dates  trail name "" D square "" David is going to do the Thru hike with me in 2018 as in 2016 he got hurt just 400 miles from Mt Katahdin, these two have been a great help to me,
When I get a little help with this page I will post more on training,  getting gear , and some photos , its getting closer every day , my wife thinks I am Crazy but then she always has ,any one can live on the flat but its more exciting living  on the Edge

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582970,"Crazy Brit here checking in ,I did write a piece sometime back on our shakedown hike up in Pennsylvania. But I hit the wrong button It got deleated so I'm trying again
We left Bradenton on the 8-18 -2017  we're heading toward Pennsylvania and Eckville  shelter that's 1200 miles so we are going to make one stop overnight, and I got two great guys going with me Dave ,aka “ Penguin Man” and Don who is yet to get a ,proper trail name
Dave drove all the way it was a great trip not to much traffic ,and great conversation , when they could get a word in,we arrived at the shelter about three in the afternoon , nice camp site, set up our tents and drove into town to get a good meal and pick up a few items.
When we were all set up Dave drove his car to a friends house where it would stay untill we were finished and need to get home, our aim was to hike from Eckville shelter to Delaware Water Gap, Made my first coffee on the trail, that done in to bed.
We had a very good night sleep and woke to a really heavy dew this campsite is down in a small little valley so we get pretty damp anyway we dried our tents and had a  good breakfast and then got all packed up and ready, let's do this,this is our start of the trail.of course it was uphill to the start of the trail then there it was the famous white blaze a bit faded but nevertheless my first white blaze. It was a nice walk through some woods ,though pretty easy so far where are all these rocks.
Then it started uphill small rocks then these got bigger and bigger ,we had lunch at a place called “Dan's Pulpit”. Great views, but on we go more more rocks I was sure that the ridge runners have piled them up right in our way, every Rockfield had a pretty white blaze going right into the center of it. 
We made it to the Allentown shelter. We were not pushing the miles as Dave was getting through a bout of test Testecular cancer, and it was at Eckville Shelter that he had to come off the trail and get treatment for this this was in 2013, so this is a pilgrimage for him to get back where he finished and to see if the chemo has messed him up.
He is doing great just the big climbs get to him, and he has to stop and rest hey “Hike your own hike” , we are here to support him there but for the grace of God go I.
Allentown Shelter is a great place, met some great people one was Scott a Sobo he was on his way and going to finish at Springer Mountain where he has a house, real cool guy then as we were sat around the fire in Walked a young guy didn't get his name, just had his dinner, very quiet guy he just set up is bivi ,that was  it ,he had just done a 30 mile trek over this terrain awesome.
I had a restless night, had breakfast ,coffee ,oatmeal then packed up our tents, our young Sobo was long gone, Scott had told us that the water supply was just down the mountain, and the first spring was dry but there was another just a bit further down on the yellow blaze trail,this was OK. He also said there was a blue blaze out to the trail just below the shelter.
“WRONG” we must've heard him wrong as we cannot find the blue blaze, and after bushwhacking we decided to head back to the shelter, Dave by this time was in trouble so we decided to rest up there, there was no pressure to do miles as we were out testing no good trying to kill Dave that bloody Chemo really Sucks.
We set up our tents and had a nap, hey there is no agenda let's collect some firewood and stay here tonight we are learning stuff all the time, and you “don't leave your wing man”, this night I slept really well and we broke camp at 8 o'clock nice easy hike out to a service road there we find our first signs of trail angels ,there were 10, 1 gallon jugs of water left by the trail angel, his name was “Dapper “ and he had done a NOBO hike in 2017 thanks ”Dapper” .
We topped up our water bottles and headed out, we came out of the forest at US 309 right along side the Blue Mountain Inn, and we were invited in for lunch and a couple of beers, pretty cool, after lunch it was onto Tripoli campsite it was a hard climb down to the campsite really steep Dave is going to find it tough tomorrow morning coming out, a really cool campsite, a hunter has set up an A-frame shelter , we set up our tents  had dinner I had a mountain house chicken breast and mashed potatoes it actually tasted like chicken I also had a double hot chocolate got into bed at 6:50 hard day tomorrow “Crazy Brit “”out” good night.
10-21-17,  hiking out looked tough we were looking straight up and Dave had gone on, so myself and Don decided to push and do it  nonstop, which we did it was awesome ,we met Dave at the top he was fine just sat there and resting. On over rocks boulder field's, and we came out at the legendary Knife Edge ,wow this is a hard climb up but on top the view was stunning the White blazes went right down the center of the Knife  Edge really amazing, there were big drops on either side, the view was absolutely amazing ,we had a snack and met some hikers going north and a couple going south.
On we went ,rocks, rocks, “oh did I tell you rocks” from the top of one  of the huge pile of rocks and boulders, I looked  into the forest, and there was a perfectly nice trail, the only difference was no white Blaze, So up-and-down every rock or boulder pile we saw had white blaze’s going over them  “ Sadists “.
Eventually we came out to the Oven Knob car park, this is where we stopped for lunch it was at this time that Dave decided that his hiking days in the mountains was over, chemo had taken it's toll on Dave's body ,and for now he was done, I have never seen a person so beat down it was really sad, at least he was man enough to admit defeat ,tough as this was.
Dave called his friends and they said they would bring his car over, after checking that all was good, he told us to go so with heavy hearts Don and I left him and walked into the forest up the trail, we were heading to Asheville Tower Road, so Dave would meet up with us.
We had a great hike there was some really tough places ,we even have time to check out Oak Oven Knob this is a lump of rock sticking out through the forest, there we saw the Audubon Society doing a raptor count the raptors were on a migratory course, 
there were lots of sightseers at this point it's not far for them to walk in from the car park and enjoy the view.
We had to check out the shelter at Bake Oven Nob this  shelter is one of the oldest on the Appalachian Trail, there were two guys there setting up for the night it looked really cozy we had a little chat, good times, I went into the shelter to check out the visitors book, and on the opposing page were I was to  sign there was a note from Graybeard the 82 year old guy who would be setting the record for the oldest person to Thru Hike the Appalachian Trail in one Year.
Of course I should have taken a photo of his message and his logo right opposite mine, then it was on again rocks, rocks, rocks ,these freaking rocks must've been piled up here to piss off Thru  Hikers, we popped out of the forest by some powerlines, and there right down in the valley Far below was a guy with a blueshirt on , its Dave , we scramble down to the parking lot he was so pleased that both Don and I  had made it over this rough part of the trail, he felt good that both Don and Myself were pleased were our performances.
We loaded Into Dave's car and he gave us a tour of his old stomping grounds of Palmerton I forgot to tell you that David grew up not far from here.,We drove to Palmerton to look around and have a big dinner, We have to search around for a place to buy a beer and I picked up a six pack for us to have sat around our camp fire tonight.
Dave then drove us back to Lehigh Bridg, ande we hiked  up to just under Outerbridge  Shelter,so on the way up we could look across at the Lehigh Gap where we will be hiking tomorrow, I went on ahead and there was a party going on at the Outerbridge Shelter ,so we found a great campsite off of the trail, this small campsite was perfect, and it has a small little fire pit so we set up camp, collected our firewood, this would be perfect for our last night on the AT trail we lit our fire and sat around having dinner and a couple of beers, we toasted each other and the AT it was a perfect end to a great shakedown hike lots of elevation ,rocks ,rocks,rocks even around the rocks I was pleased with myself now it was time for bed.
We woke to a great day, packed up and hiked down to the car, packed in our bags and headed across the river to Palmerton for a big breakfast “Yum Yum” Bacon ,Eggs ,Hashbrowns, Toast and two big Pancakes lots of coffee I've got to get my” Hiker hunger ready”.
After breakfast we then drove down to the Lehigh bridge and parked in the car park ,we looked up at Lehigh gap and started up, nice and gentle then steeper and steeper and steeper ,once we got above the tree line it started to get hand over hand ,and to think I have no pack on good job I had my hiking poles ,we got to the top the view was spectacular you could see for miles and miles all up and then the Lehigh Valley. I'm going to remember this view for a long long time. Back to the car all packed up ready for our trip back to the flatlands of Florida.
For me it was a great hike to see what I could do, and test all my gear I only need to make a few tweaks here and there I am so pleased. It was a great pleasure to spend time with really cool people, Don and Dave were great hiking companions. I feel really bad for Dave his dream of finishing the ATA has had a major setback, we can only hope it's for a short time. Don is going ahead with his plans he aims to start his thru hike along with myself on March 10th.
 Thanks for reading hope you didn't get too bored there's even more to come.

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582991,"Hi There ""  Crazy Brit  Here ""  Well going to take another overnight camp out in Myakka State Park , I again chose to camp at Bee Island nice and easy hike in and a nice campsite, its only a 3 mile hike in to camp ,but you have to carry your own firewood , not so good ,last time Andrew from Trailwalkers brought out the fire wood in a cart , no easy feat in itself, this time I would have to carry my own , I went to the store and picked up 2 bundles of firewood , oh dear to heavy ,so i picked up 2 logs with a swedish stye hole system that you light the small fuel pad and  ""Whoosh"" you have an instant fire Great !!!!I set up my tent got all my gear prepped and ready , o/k what do i do now ,I know lets go for a hike  "" how novel ""
This park is so cool hiked over to the power lines and walked up the trail ,saw some Hogs running around, great hiking weather a bit chilly with a threat of raining it was pretty windy ,perfect for a shakedown hike, got back to the campsite and set about getting my dinner, had a recipe from John at Trailwalkers . got it all going perfect , Rice ,Chicken ,peppers, Garlic , some dried onions and boiling water ,meal for Royalty, have a cup of coffee, and settle down in my Dyneema chair that I have made , the Moon is coming up peace and quiet ,so time for a little Jack Daniels and Coke , All is well with the World.
All is well until I hear some movement in the undergrowth ,What the Hell is that ???????  "" Grunt Grunt ,Snort Snort"" what the hell ,a rather large Sow Hog starts coming into my campsite and starts to rummage around all my trash is up high as is my food, she is now about 50 ft away from me I shine my headlight on her she is completely oblivious to me, she just kept on rooting around , then more of her friends came to join the party, at this time I must admit I felt a little bit anxious, wonder if they knew I had had a lot of Bacon the weekend, I think I will have another Jack and Coke, it was kind of interesting I have hiked in the Park for years allways looking for the Wild Hogs, well boy now you have a whole mess of them.
Its getting later and later ,the hogs are staying away from me and the fire, so I decide, hell time for bed, all went well until a hog started sniffing around the tent , I have a Nemo Hornet and the head part has a single layer of material between me and this big fat hog , I am a little uneasy to tell you the truth, still What could Happen ????? after a while I drifted of to sleep ,Thanks Jack Daniels, the hogs left, all was very Quiet , ""Wrong "" this was the time that the Coyote's come out to play and hunt for their suppers , Man they were going Crazy, louder and louder , closer and closer,I heard them sniffing around the camp site, OH my God I am about to be eaten by a pack of Coyote's, they went past the campsite, I heaved a sigh and went to sleep.
After this episode, I dropped of to sleep , awoke to a really bright day , thanks Jack, made up my breakfast ,washed down with two cups of coffee, had a short hike around some of their great trails ,then headed back to my car , another great shakedown trip , learning all the time ,I think that I have my cooking down , also my setting up of my tent ,getting things organized, packing up in the morning is my weak point at the moment.
Learning all the time getting all the little kinks out, I feel pretty good about my up coming trip, confident, 'Yes I think So ,I CAN do this""

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583275,"Hi there Crazy Brit Here
 Another shake then trip this time we're going to Little Manatee State Park this is an awesome place,
I got to the ranger station in the Manatee State Park only to find that the primitive campsite was booked by a large group,” Damn” should've phoned first I suppose, what should I do next 
I'll call my friends in Trail walkers Gear Outfitters to see if there are any hiking trails or camping around this area.
They tell me that there’s camping at the Alifia State Park ,well drove up there and I got to the ranger station only to find that their primitive camping is for Boy Scouts only ,think I'm too old to pass as  a Boy Scout, well I've come this far so may as well stay they offer me a car camping site this is all new so yes I think I will do it.
I get directed to my allotted site it's a nice place just seems a bit strange setting up with all these large RVs around me, my tent looks kind of out of place set on this well manacured piece of grass, tho it is perfect for Hiking,and is cosy for one person.
  
I set up my tent and go for a hike around the trials this is a great place for hiking and it's a Mountain bike Paradise, its  one of the best in the country I am told, had a great hike around the trials and came back and got out my cooking gear.
My neighbors in an RV came over to check out my my set up, they were very interested ,I told him what it was going to do and they just walk away, one guy was pondering “Why”, others just shaking their heads, got a crazy one here, all went well had my dinner a couple of beers , setteled down  for a good nights sleep, what a joke !!!!!!!!!!!
The peace and quiet didn't last long, I was woken up by what sounded  like fireworks a hell of a lot of noise, I got up I'm dressed hell might as well watch the show, a couple of the other campers were trying to see the fireworks show, but no lights or aerial fireworks this noise kept on going for what seemed hours.
When this noise went down everything was nice and quiet until I started hearing the trucks, they start from a stoplight, they erv up and go through the gears there's a long straight  for about three miles ,and you can hear them for a long long long way.
At this campsite I never heard or so any hogs ,I did hear some coyotes yapping but they didn't last long, I find out this morning that just across the highway was the Hillsborough tactical firearms facility, and the swat teams were out practicing ,they sure used  lots of lots of flash bangs and A.R. 15rounds taxpayers money at work big sign “Bad guys keep away.”
Bit of a fitful sleep, 
I asked my neighbor in the RV did he hear the trucks driving down the highway he said his RV is soundproof so he never heard nothing, but strange he did hear the fireworks.
This was another great shake down , the only thing wrong was on this one, I found three leaks in my Nemo hornet tent, down the centerline ,one drip right on my head, and this has made up my mind I will change it for a big Agnes fly Creek 2 person HV I suppose this is what shake downs are for after all, testing ,testing, testing.

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583386,"Hi there this is crazy Brit again,
 This may be my last shake down hike before heading up to Dave's house in Nantahala North Carolina, Dave's coming with me on the trail his , trail name is “ D square “he has a house just up the gorge from the Nantahalla outdoor center ,I will leave Bradenton on March 6 to start March 10 its coming up real fast .
I'm headed to Little Manatee State Park ,this time I called  ahead and got a booking its a great hiking park, trail is about 7 1/2 miles in a loop I am camping in the primitive campsite it's about halfway thru
It's a nice hike through the woods, I was only carrying about a liter of water as I wanted to test out my filtering system ,well I crossed the river Shall I stop or no ,thinking that the campsite was pretty close I thought why carry the extra weight” Wrong Decision,” it turned out that the campsite was one and a half miles further along “Lesson Learn’t “ when you need water fill at your first location.
The campsite was great I set up my tent ,I’m really liking this Fly Creek I tried the fast Pitch method , where you erect the grounsheet and the rain fly, then get inside and put up the inner tent ,you need to do this in the rain to keep inner tent dry ,and it worked out great, I had to walk an extra 3 miles there and back to collect my water and filter it ,as I said before” Lesson learned”.
I collected my firewood there was an ample supply after Hurricane Irma which closed the park for two months, trees down all over the place, my camp was already, all there was to do is to cook my dinner, poor Jack Daniels and Coke and relax
Had a great fire really good dinner and apres dinner drinks ,time for bed ,going into my really great sleep system I'm nodding of “ Yeah to be woken up by a couple of hogs” no problem tho, then at 1 AM on the dot the coyotes started yapping.
These coyote’s started calling from different sides of the campsite ,then all of a sudden all hell broke loose ,the damn things must've cornered their prey and dinner was served, I found out the next day from a volunteer, that the hogs were having their young, I'm thinking Bacon must've been on the coyote’s minds.
After that episode I slept really good ,had a good breakfast packed up and headed back to the ranger station to book out a great shakedown,  still pleased with my tent ,all my gear, my liner and sleeping bag are great my tent is working out really good ,my pack feels really comfortable,  my Jet Boil cooking system is working out nice ,it boils water in 90 secs , in fact I am really pleased with all aspects of my gear ,and think ????? i am ready to go Hiking.
My thanks to my Friends at Trailwalker Gear Outfitters , Jimmy , John and Judy also Andrew who is about to go Backpacking to India, all my friends for their continued support in this adventure, I know I am living some of their dreams,
And last but not least my extended family and friends both here and in the UK, and really last but never least my Wife Janice, who thought it a joke at first ,but as I began buying my gear, thought  “Hell I had better start writing out his Honey Do List before he leaves for NC on the 6th of March “ ,  might add she is pretty good at writing lists.
Thanks for reading ,hope your not to bored, my next report should be from NC and my final days prepping ready for the big day “ MARCH  10th”",,View Entry,"Feb 27, Tue",0
Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583387,"Hi there crazy Brit here again.
Sorry but I have to squeeze in one last shakedown, got a call from Dan and Griff, do you all want to go to the Alifia campsite for a night, do some hiking in the park “Oh Yeah”
All the arrangements were made I get picked up by Griff ,he he is one of those strange people that run ultra marathons in Arizona and New Mexico, he is 74 years of age” Oh” and he's also done two of the Everglade Challenges sailing a little Hobie catamaran from Fort De Soto, St. Petersburg ,to Key Largo is a tough M.F.
We drive out and pick up Dan and off we go these two will be hiking with us on the AT it will be  four of us ,Me “Crazy Brit” - Dave “D. Square”-  Griff” The Old  Guy’  and Dan “Uncle D “.
We are going to have some fun.
After lunch at Wawa’s, we arrive at the Alifia State Park, and book in,we get a really good campsite, I unpack my gear ,and start to put up my tent, the other to sit back and watch, I felt as though I was being critiqued, when all is done I get a” well-done “coming from those two I am pleased.
OK it's time for a hike we put on our packs and start to walk around the really great trails here, we only did about 6 miles, 
as it was starting to get late and the guys had to put up their tents, I sit and watch and give them a clap when they finished.
 Time to make dinner, couple cups of coffee, and a couple of beers, we had a great fire ,good company it was awesome ,no hogs but we saw plenty of deer walking by, really good evening we have a Jack and Coke for dessert then it's time for bed only woke up once and heard the Coyote’s yipping and yapping, apart from that slept really well.
We awoke to a really great day ,sun was just coming up, we had a good breakfast and coffee ,we have time for another hike this morning this time Griff is taking us on the other part of the park where the mountain bike trails are, this was crazy big ups and downs can feel my calf muscles working, how  they ride these mountain bikes here I will never know we saw some but they weren't on the really difficult section of the trail.
We finish a really cool hike, back to our campsite, and pack up we're heading home on the way we again stop for another Wawa’s lunch, great  hike with great company it was a great idea.
Hope you will follow my great Adventure on the Appalachian Trail.

Dave is up and ready to go my first time packing up a wet tent, went pretty good bit strange doing it in the dark. All packed and we are on the way, today we are headed to Lance Creek campsite it’s at mile mark 23.9. Good days hiking but it’s going to be a real bad rainy stormy night to night. So we get there about 2:30 to set up camp as it’s to much to go up and over Blood Mountain today. Camp is set up and I get into my sleeping bag for an hour and a half nap.

Been resting up now for the last 4 days. Cabin fever has set in real bad.Went for a walk down to the center this morning felt pretty good, so might go for a hike to Fontana Dam tomorrow.
Dan has a problem with his knee, so we are taking him to Silva on Monday so he can get an M R I to see what’s happening in his knee. He is a stubborn guy and can take a lot of pain, but this is hurting him.

We went down to the river to watch the selection trials for the USA National Team and future Olympic Kayakers, it was freezing on the river, but these guys were out there doing their thing, and they say I am crazy.This whole weather system at the moment is really crazy, lots of ice and snow mixed in with rain, some times we even see the Sun.

Slackpacking From Spivey
What a day got our Shuttle to Spivey Gap, had a good nights sleep in our little Creekside Cabin.
As usual Dave was up first went up to the communal kitchen to make our coffee and cook our pizza for breakfast tasting real good.
We were dropped at the Spivey Gap and started our Slackpacking back to Sams Gap. Slackpacking is Hiking without a full pack so it’s very much lighter to carry.
We thought we were being smart heading back to where we started, but this climb out was Horrendous 8 miles climb up to Big Bald Mountain.
This a large bald mountain with an Elevation 5516 ft the Views are 360 degrees, you can see for miles, made a video, Awesome.
The big problem with hiking today was that the Ice was started to melt making the trail really slippery, this is a double edge sword, your on the ice or you slip on the Mud.
The climb went on and on really tough all the way to the bald.
Coming down is really tough on your knees but it’s a fine line between up or down.
It took us a lot longer to get back to Sams Gap for our pick up than we planned, feeling a bit sore now,b ut just got out of the massage chair had a beer, and had dinner, feeling good now.
Tomorrow we have a ride down to Spivey Gap, so we will then head out to Erwin TN, that’s about 11.4 miles hiking for tomorrow. We will be met by Dan as we come out of the woods, he is staying in our Cabin at the Cantarroso Farm and Apiary, looks like a great place even got Fishing poles I can use,more about that tomorrowCrazy Brit out

Had lunch on top of No Business Knob, great views.As we approached Erwin we could see the town for miles out, up down, up down, we looked out over the town and the Nolichucky River, I am really lucky to experience these fantastic views.There were a lot of switch backs going down to town.The trail comes out on the River Road right by the bridge over the river, just down the road is Johnny ‘s Hostel.

When it was not like that it was slick mud and you were slipping and sliding all over the trail.We came out to Greasy Creek Gap and there sat on a rock was Dan our Slack pack chauffeur, he had walked up a mile on a forest track to meet us, he was also testing his bad knee.Great to see him out in the woods enjoying himself,he led us down the trail to his car.

Dan is awesome he is very frustrated that he can’t hike but he is making it so much easier for Dave and myself.We had to walk about a mile to get to the trail all uphill, and to think this mile doesn’t count.We started down the trail all ways a bad sign going down hill, we know we have to climb over 2500 ft today, to the top of Roan Mountain, we are starting at 4034 ft.The climb at first was up to the views at Little Rock Knob. It is really hard to describe these views, they are really spectacular, you can see for miles and miles.We had a descent to Hughes Gap, this is the start of the climb up to the top of Roan Mountain.This is one hard climb even tho they have put switch backs in, we got to a point where you could see a defined line where the snow started.First it was just powdered snow, then the ice started it got worse and worse, and to make it worse the ground was rock solid so it was hard to get grip with the Trekking poles.You could easily get into big trouble if you were not careful. We got to the top thru a pine forest the smell of the pines were really strong Amazing!!!On the top there was the site of the old Cloudland Hotel, what a place this must have been $2 per day, $10 per week and $30 per month to stay in Absolute luxury.We came to Carvers Gap and there was Dan parked ready to pick us up he is doing a great job Slack packing us around this week.We are back to the Hostel, I get the Pot bellies stove going in the main room of the loft, have dinner, going to get a shower then it’s bed for me.

It got worse and worse, then the wind started to blow up in the high 20 mph range and gusting higher up to I would estimate 30+mph.The scenes of the snow in the forest are fantastic, the biggest problem was that because of the weight of the snow the Rhododendrons branches are real low and you have to keep ducking them and when you hit them you get covered in snow.Also there are a lot of wind blown trees across the trail, and you have either go around or climb over.The snow is laying a lot now and blowing right in our faces, but as we descend the snow gets lighter.Now a new problem arises the Trail is flooded with water as the run off from yesterday’s storms has caused the streams to flood, this went on for a mile or so until we came out on the road leading to our Hostel Bear Creek Hostel and Cabins.

There is even an ice cream store halfway.The river also follows the rail track it is a beautiful river, saw some fishermen Fly fishing wish I had more time to watch them they did have some fish Brown and Rainbow Trout.We carried on up and up. We got passed by our young friends they always give us a hard time we are the old guys, they all have a lot of respect for us especially David as he has done an AT before they ask his advice.They are really cool guys, when they get going they really move fast, most of them stopped at the Lost Mountain Shelter. You could see it was going to be noisy there so we carried on to a campsite by some huge Fir Trees, great site water was pretty close.Put up our tents got water and made dinner tonight I am having Lasagna, cup of coffee and a Gator Bar, good stuff.One of our friends “trail name Burn” has just come in to stay with us, he is a Chef hence the name Burn. The sun has just gone down over the mountains and the temperatures have already dropped. Great hiking in shorts today, should be the same tomorrow, then we are expecting rain for the next three days after that.The rain adds a new dimension to hiking, it’s not bad walking in the rain, just the putting up and taking down of the tent, it sucks oh well it’s all life on the trail everything runs around the weather systems, when to go when to stay.I will catch you all tomorrowCrazy Brit out18.2 miles45.320 steps280 FloorsAnyone can walk on on the flat “if you can find it here again.Only got 1703.4 miles to Mt KatahdinBig day tomorrow we push thru 500 miles.","Damascus

While taking down the tent I had my coffee going, all packed ready to go, sit down have a coffee, think I have won David over to having a coffee and breakfast before we hit the trail.As always it’s uphill to start, but this went on all day, until we came out to buzzard Rock, Wow what a view 360 degrees.Then of course it was uphill AGAIN, finally we came out to the Thomas Knob Shelter where we stopped for a rest, snacks and drinks. Here we met up with Which way and Next Step we had met them early on the trail, nice people we are staying at the same place tonight.Back to the hike, we eventually came to the Grayson Highlands State Park. This is where the famous ponies are, they All came over from Wales in the UK, really friendly ponies maybe because I had an apple to give them.Just after this came the Fat Man Squeese, being thin guys we did it with ease although on the video I make it look hard.We saw a lot more ponies with foals, lots of Day visitors come up here to see these great animals.We then walked to our pick up point and got picked up by Denis and taken to the Greyson Highlands General store and Inn, free shuttle from the trail and good food I had a Salmon Burger with fries and couple of beers.We get a breakfast and shuttle back to the trail, one big problem is that tomorrow they are expecting rain, a lot of rain in fact they will be on a flood watch for next couple of days so will be an interesting few days.More fun tomorrow16.5 miles37.335 steps 184 floorsAny one can walk on the flatOnly got another 1668.7 miles to MY Katahdin","US 58 foot bridge

We walked all day hard hiking in these conditions, we had to do the 18.4 miles because there is no place to get off the trail.Near the end of the day we came across the young guys camped out it was lashing with rain, Oh well they are young and can do that!!!We passed by and came out on a forest road that ran into VA 16. We started to thumb a lift a couple of cars went by then a car came the other way it had passed us, he shouted out I am coming back to pick you up.The rain was flooding the road but sure enough he turned down the road and had us in the car ,another Trail Angel ,his name was Tony he took us right to the door of our Hostel,thank you Tony ,wow two Trail Angels in one day .We are now settled in our bunk house having coffee going to cook our dinner, life is good, all our stuff is drying out ready for another soaking tomorrow.Only got 14.1 miles to get into Marion tomorrow, start time is 7:00am Sharp.Oh forgot to say the wind was forecasted to be 35 mph with Higher gusts in high elevations, guess where we were?????18.4 Wet miles 44.314 Wet Steps

This is the Famous AT stretching out in front were these little posts with white blazes on them, when are they going to end .Then all of a sudden we come out to Chestnut Knob Shelter, a stone structure tied down with big wire straps, must get windy up here,it is all enclosed with windows and even a door, and it has individual bunks very up market.This place would be great in the summer but now inside it was freezing and tonight it will get really windy, temps are dropping to the 30 degrees, wind is going to be up in the 40 mile per hour range, no place for us to be.We head down to Walker Gap it’s supposed to be a good campsite, this is 1.6 miles down to the gap good trail and we make it in good time, about to set up our tents when a truck pulls up with two guys in it, they are waiting for a couple of hiker friends of ours, they are on their way down.Looking at these guys it looked like they might be carrying beer, so I asked them if they had any spare, sure enough they handed over two cans for me and one for Dave great guys.Now tents are all set up Dinner has been eaten, beer has been drank and I am settled down writing this journal, ready for tomorrow WHAT HILLS Today ??????15.8 Miles38.698.

Dave is down to shorts and a tee shirt, me still long pants and a shirt.The whole forest now takes on a different light, there are now leaf coverage yet so we have no canopy protection it is now really hot, strange weather patterns we are having.Hiking along the ridge we have a gentle forested side on the right with huge hard wood trees. On the left is a vertical drop on to huge rocks, a slip here and you are done for.We are aiming for Jenkins Shelter for lunch, nice shelter with a clean Privi. After lunch the trail gets better passing thru lots of Mountain Laurel groves, these shrubs grow to about 10 feet tall and are abundant all over the forests here there are only buds at the moment.The Mountain Laurel will have abundant white cupped flowers, hope to see these further up the Trail. Spring is certainly arriving here in Virginia as every day you see new forms of summer life starting to form.I can’t wait to see all the different colored greens of the leaves, it’s not going to be long, a lot of the flowers and leaf covering should be out when we start to hit the Shenandoah’s at the end of the month of May, looking forward to that, also it should start to get warmer, this is what I want more than anything, this skinny body likes heat!!!!We are now camped by a road VA 615 it’s just a gravel road that the AT crosses but there is a car park just down the road and we saw some day hikers going up the mountain so would suggest a local Beauty Spot on top of the Mountain.

David had biscuit bacon and Egg, both were awesome also had great coffee.Might sound strange to you but this was washed down with a Pepsi for the Sugar to climb the hills.We are now at a shelter called Jenny Knob it’s a pretty cool place, there are quite a few people here.Just heard that there is a forest fire up ahead, it’s up in the 700 mile area we won’t be there until the end of the week so hope it’s out when we get there.Just going to make my dinner and make a Hot Chocolate drink now going to Face time Janice and the little Man Wyatt.Goodnight18.8.

I said to him I bloody well hope so!!!!!.As we approached the road there were fire crews all over the place the trail had been closed at both ends, we were the last ones out.We walked down to Woods Hole. What a place log homes and barns all converted for Hikers, they grow there own vegetables, they make their own bread and cheese, our accommodation is great we have a private room $30 per person, which is a great price.They also make smoothies with there own milk and ice cream, heaven, there are a few young hikers working around the place doing odd jobs they are working for keep. They get free food and accommodation, a great deal. Me I have finished working any way it’s good sitting back drinking a smoothie watching them work, it’s my time now.The smoke from the controlled burn is now rolling down thru the valley, hope they get this right, we will see the results tomorrow.The big fire further up the trail has now been contained so we are told we should be going thru that area next week.Now it’s time for another smoothie as there is no beer so must go and sit in my rocking chair and watch the youngsters work.Have a great day7.2 miles19.185 Steps100 FloorsAny one can walk on the Flat” not when they are drinking a Ltd of Smoothie.Only got. 1556.1 miles to go to Mt Katahdin","Jenny Knob Shelter

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589288,"Crazy BritA hard day started off making coffee in my tent because of the wet ground outside normally I make my coffee as I am packing up my pack and my tent, it’s kind of cool I can get all my pack done and still have a half cup of coffee to sit and finish.Not today every thing is soaking wet so I have to pack it all inside the tent, then get my pack cover and lie it on the ground as I pack up my WET Tent, this is one of the worst things to do knowing that I have a wet tent to sleep in tonight.We have a terrible climb out this morning, it was really steep 1000 ft in Elevation in a half mile, over wet slippery muddy rocks, then the bonus was getting to the top our path was over rocks, roots and mud .Normally we do about 2 1/2 miles an hour we were down Trail about 1 mile per hour. We were so slow we decided to cut our day at the War Spur Shelter.About our decision time we heard thunder and down came the rain, soon the trail was a running stream of mud and water, we check the trail guide, another 3.5 miles to the shelter, Damn will this rain never stop.Eventually we get to the shelter it’s a 6 person shelter and there are only 3 there, we are in luck, I get a space as does David, but he then chooses to put up his tent and camp, he has a different tent than mine so his material sheds water better than mine.Lots of hikers are now coming in hoping for a place, they have to camp out or move on, it’s tough watching them put up wet tents.I have dinner bit better today two cups of hot chocolate.Time to write my journal and try to sleep we have two people snoring but the sound of it any way will do my best to sleep, Oh yes it’s going to be wet tomorrow.Goodnight12.4 miles32.587.

We had arrived at the shelter and got two spots great, until Dave got a bit upset by one of the guys so he decides to go out and pitch his tent.This was between rain showers, then all hell broke loose, never been in a thunder storm like it, the guys were coming into the shelter, looking for spots but we were full.It was really hard watching them put up there wet tents, then cook food. I really felt for them but you know one day it will be you out there suffering.When we started out it was raining really hard, so we were all dressed up in our rain gear, the trail was running with water, with lots of thick gooey mud.
The going was very slow especially the stream crossings, these have swollen a hell of a lot and are very trick and dangerous to cross.We have decided to stay at the Saver Hollow Shelter we can then have a easy day get in and out of the rain and dry our things out. It’s about 3 miles north on the trail from the Keffer Oak this is the largest Oak Tree on the Trail. It measures over 18 feet around and is over 300 years old.From the Oak it was all up, good thing it stopped raining. We arrived at the shelter it was .4 miles off the trail but worth it, there was only one other person here perfect.We are all set up dried out had dinner and a hot chocolate time for bed. Well after all it’s 7:30 and all good hikers should be settling down for bed.

My dad took me to see one of his films over 60 years ago at the Belgrade Cinema on Mutley Plane Plymouth UKl.People leave all sorts of Memorabilia on the site, I scratched a little message on a stone from Dave and myself.
It is set in a woodland glade on the crest of Brush Mountain a beautiful spot, we had heard a fast moving jet scream over the mountain just before we got there, kind of cool.It was here that I learned of Pats Death, so bloody sad, never enjoyed a long retirement.We had another big climb up to our campsite near the Pickle Branch Shelter, just as we put up our tents it started to rain again. Hope it’s not like a couple of nights ago.We went down to the stream and filtered a couple of liters of water enough for dinner and coffee and breakfast in the morning.Tomorrow we go over the Dragon Tooth, they are Stone Monoliths, and in the wet will be very slippery we want to get there as the sun is rising so we need an even earlier start.Tomorrow we will go thru the 700 Mile mark and tomorrow night we will be in a Hostel where we can shower and wash our clothes. Two days after that we will be in Daleville VA where we will have a day off and a great big steak dinner and maybe a beer or two.Goodnight from a very sad Colin and it’s started raining agai.

It actually takes your breath away, you can never get the view with a camera.From here it was down to a ridge, where it was up down, up down, we are now headed to the Tinker Cliffs. One hell of a long climb, really takes it out of you. We eventually got up to the Cliffs, this again is another Spectacular view. The country side up here looks so lush, it’s great to see the little farms and homes all set out in the fields below us.It’s really going well at the moment and tomorrow we are heading into Daleville Va we are staying in a hotel and we will have a zero day there.I have a new pair of boots coming tomorrow, just in time as these are beginning to fall apart after 700 miles non stop hiking getting wet every day, the soles are still good but the uppers are done for.We are going to get New Darn tuff socks there as these are going hard only washing them once a week!!!!!!.We have got a great campsite here, we are just below the Lambert’s Meadow Shelter, in fact we are in the Lambert Meadow Campsite, we have a picnic table and a large Metal Bear proof Box. There are only four tents here at the moment. Just had Mark from Ohio over for a chat, nice to spend time with different people, it’s a great world out there.We only have just over 9 miles to do tomorrow so we should be done just before lunch. It will be nice to have a hot shower and some good town food, it would be great to have all different foods on the trail but when you have to carry it all it rather cuts your options down a bit.The bugs are beginning to bite so bug spray will be on the shopping list tomorrow in Daleville.Time to go to bedWill say goodnight17.5.

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590036,"Crazy BritWell our campsite in Lambert’s Meadow was the best place we have camped at, just about a half mile from the Lambert Shelter.This site is in a valley it has a picnic table, water about 20 ft away even bear boxes. Apparently, bears have been pretty active here.We left camp at 6:00 am and of course started uphill, it was a perfect hike up along the ridge leading to Daleville, we had some great views of a huge reservoir looked beautiful in the early morning.It’s great with the fragrances of pine trees and wild honeysuckle, birds are singing it’s really good to be breathing fresh air. Oh and a big point we have to collect our water from Streams and Springs, the taste is so different from town water it is a good thing when you run out of town water and go to really fresh water.We collect our water in a plastic bag onto this is fitted a water filter you compress the bag and fresh water comes out into our bottles.Sorry I digress from our hike. We keep going up and up, we stop for a snack at a huge great Monolith rock I climb up to half way but decide not to try any further, thank goodness.Today is one of our best hiking days, we are soon looking down at our destination. Now at last we are heading down at perfect trail not to many rocks, we pass a few day hikers coming up the trail.Eventually we pop out on to US 220 it’s quite a shock cars, trucks whizzing by just a few feet away. We head to our Hotel HO JOs, book in, shower and head to eat at Bojangles for Chicken, then to Kroger’s to check it out and buy some snacks, beer and wine, down to the coffee shop for a Expresso milk shake Awesome.

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590185,"Crazy BritYesterday was a zero day so we just went to the coffee shop, then to Kroger’s for shopping, couple of beers had a sleep then across the road for a Mexican dinner.Had dinner with the young group that we have been on the trail with for a couple of weeks. One of them Helix has just heard that day that he has got into Med School, great news.
So today started off with breakfast at the hotel, then just a short walk up the road and we are back into the woods, you can hear the noise from the towns for a awful long time.But the good news is it gradually fades away to peace and quiet.It’s just after 6:30 and the temperature is gradually climbing the reports say it’s going to be up in the 90 degrees. Which is really bad news for us carrying a full pack and we have to carry more water as we are now stopping every 1 1/2 hours for a drink, it’s a tough one today.We are so lucky that at last we have some leaf cover for without that it would be tough on us .The trail is not to bad today no big ugly climbs, just lots of switch backs, we actually came out on to the Blue Ridge Parkway then the trail ran alongside the road for some length of time. This is one of my favorite roads with really great views, we were told there was trail magic at one of the viewing points, we are excited maybe they have a cold Coke?????Of course we get to the spot, Damn no car or truck, no coke we are deflated. So it’s on to are Shelter it’s 1/4 mile of the trail. We want to camp in our tents, but no tent spaces so we are in the shelter.Time to do my journal and have a coffee, that done its time to cook my dinner.

I look at David, well he does a bit! She announces she snores and we have been warned.I got awaken by David we want to get on the trail early to beat the heat, had a bit of a fitful sleep as always in a shelter, love my tent, like Dan Caruso says it’s kind of weird waking up to a strangers face a few inches from mine.When we got back on the trail David tells me that he hardly slept, for Blue Jay, snoring in his ear, OH Pay Back is so sweet!!!!!Today’s hiking was just mainly following the Blue Ridge Parkway for a number of miles, not many big ups or downs, just HOT as HELL.We only have 10 plus miles to do and they are soon done, we are stopping every 1 1/2 hours to eat and drink, have to keep hydrated.

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590512,"Crazy BritThank God Today we Slack Packed. Not because of the miles we had to walk, that is becoming no problem, nor with the Terrain, although that was demanding at times. We are going South.The Heat at the moment is unbearable in the higher altitudes where there’s no leaf cover. We started out at 6:30 from our Hostel At Middle Creek Campground.Luke the son of the owner shuttled us to Petites Gap up on the Blue Ridge Parkway. It was already really hot, we were carrying 2 plus ltrs of water.Things were going really good, we were knocking of the miles. I did a live video from Thunder ridge Overlook, but as we were getting higher the leaf coverage became less and less, and it got hotter and hotter.We were now stopping every hour to have a drink and eat some snacks, just to keep the engine filled. There were some really long climbs, not steep just long we crossed the Blue Ridge twice, once From North to South then South to North. This is a really cool road it runs from Waynesboro VA to Cherokee NC a distance of approx 450 miles.
By this time we were passing our fellow hikers going North, we are constantly getting ribbed about the fact we are Slack packing. Of course most of them have done it so we just laugh, no good getting older if not getting wiser.The flowers are really coming out now, every turn there are more and more, especially at the lower altitudes. lt looks really good now where a couple of weeks ago there were no greenery on the forest floor now it is all green with loads and loads of flowers.We camel up on water at the Cornelius Shelter. We drink we a ltr of water, fill our bottles and continue on toward our destination at Jennings Creek Road.Our last climb is up and over Fork Mountain not that high at only 2042 ft but a long climb the last 500 ft were really steep, we had to stop a couple of times.At last we were up and over now we had a 2.4 mile down hill hike, in fact it was down to 951 feet so quite steep, we didn’t care it was down hill perfect.It’s kind of strange the last 1/2 mile feels like it goes on forever, then there is the road and the creek, Heaven!!!!!As we were sat waiting for the shuttle Luke drove by going home from school, so we got a ride up to the campground.I got a Vanila milkshake to cool down, then had dinner a beer on the patio going up for a shower now and into bed. Goodnight from a very tired Colin18.7 miles43.343.

We stopped by the Matt’s Creek Shelter and I topped up with water from the stream.We followed the flow of the stream for a long way, it’s pretty cool to see a stream start to grow, small feeder streams feed it and suddenly you have a really beautiful looking stream.We had a last climb then it was all down hill to the James river. Going down is sometimes worse than going up, lots of rocks ready to trip you up, one small rock could ruin your whole AT Hike.We come out on to the James River Bridge this was built especially for the AT and looks like it was an old Railway Bridge. There is a railway bridge along side and we saw a Coal train roll by, there were so many trucks all loaded with Coal, really long train.We waited for our shuttle driver, it was very hot waiting by the road soon a couple more hikers turned up they were going to Glasgow, our driver was by now very late, plus no coverage at this spot.A van stopped and picked us all up and took us to a store in town where we can get cell coverage. We call our driver and he is running late, soon he arrives and take us to Lexington and the Econo Motel.Had to walk a long way to get a pack of beer, but I was successful so we are now resting up had a good dinner and watching television, having a well earned beer.Tomorrow we are headed to meet Dan go to Trail days in Damascus .So goodnight will report more tomorrow 9.9 Miles28.534 Steps95 Floors.

WE ARE BACK !!!!!! We got a shuttle from the car rental to the trail head at the US 501 at the James River Footbridge, this the longest foot use only bridge on the whole AT.So here we go again, the three guys who started this adventure with the sole purpose of a Thru Hike to Mt Katahdin, as regular readers know Dan hurt his knee and had to head to Florida to get it sorted out, but now he is back and a testing to get back on the trail.We let him lead we have a target to get to the Punch Bowl Shelter and camp out. It’s a 10.5 mile hike with a big climb at the beginning, we are following a small river at first winding up thru the valley.It’s not long into the hike before we come across our first storm damaged tree, it had blown down right across the trail. We have to duck real low to get under as there was no way around it, wonder how many more ????We start our climb, good job there are switch backs, it’s just over 3 miles of climbing pretty tough for a first day back. We let Dan go on, he needs to test his knee on his own.I find a great spot to Facetime everybody, we are climbing now for a couple of hours and finally get to the top. There is Dan sat waiting for us starting to eat his lunch, great place to stop.We get going again after lunch and then stop for a break at the Ottie Cline Powell Monument. This young 7 year old boy left his local school and wandered off alone for just over 7 miles his body was found in this exact spot.I had a little yellow duck that was in our bathroom at the hotel, I signed it and left it for little Ottie to play with, couldn’t think of a better place.
We have now arrived at our target campsite and are all set up. We were supposed to get some rain later so will have to wait and see, the bugs are out in force going to have to get some stronger bug spray. Soon be ready to get some dinner. I can hear the other two making plans for a really early start to beat the heat and get into Buena Vista tomorrow. It’s only a 12.5 mile or so hike so should be done early depending on Dans knee.Very quiet here at the moment just another hiker setting up his Hammock, oh well time to close and make my dinner.10.5 Miles25.525.

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591491,"Crazy BritAs I mentioned yesterday, we were camping at the Punchbowl shelter, I was at the picnic table cooking my dinner and we were the only hikers there.In just a few minutes there were five people wanting a space in the shelter, we told them we were camping, they were delighted, so after dinner we went back to our tents.It wasn’t long before the thunder started, then the rain so we were in our tents and in bed by 6:30pm which is like Hikers midnight.It started to rain then the storm started it went on for over 3 hours. The rain was so heavy it was deafening inside the tents, it was quite a light show like I said it went on and on. In the end I pulled the sleeping bag over my head and went to sleep.I was awakened by Dave at 5:00 am and had to pack up a wet tent, time for a coffee and some snacks and we are on the trail at 5:45 am.Surprisingly the trail is in pretty good condition, the torrential rain has washed away all the soft mud, leaving a hard packed clay like soil.It was getting really hot and very humid, water was dripping everywhere.We had a climb then a nice long trail down to a river. This had a bridge over it the river was in full flood. We are hoping the smaller streams are going to be ok for us to cross.Well it’s not long before we come to a stream. Yes you got it, it’s flowing like crazy we all get across safe and carry on heading to Buena Vista. We have to detour for a bit as one of the bridges has been damaged and closed.Dan is leading and going great. It won’t be long for him to be back in trail shape. We are only doing a 11.3 mile hike to get him back into it. The biggest thing that happened today is that we have gone thru the 800 mile barrier. We should be thru the 1000 miles and in Harpers Ferry the Half waypoint in a couple of weeks. It’s hard to believe we are almost there, well half way at least.We passed an interesting place today it was a small strip of land alongside the river that was farmed by a black community after the Civil War and was actually farmed up into the 1900s it was share cropping, so they still had to give up a proportion of the crops grown .The place closed when the land was sold to the Forest Service, I am going to have to check into this.???We came out onto the US 60 and tried to thumb a lift. It only took about 15 mins when a lady called Maggie drove by, went down the road came back and picked us up and brought us to the Buena Vista hotel.We have eaten had a beer and are now ready for bed.

Cool old guy called “Pines” why I know not will ask him tomorrow.Any way he took us out over the mountain outside of Buena VistA the views on the Blue Ridge Parkway are absolutely stunning. Tried Facetime everybody but it’s hard to describe the view.I love it up here in the Mountains. The fragrances of all the different plants, flowers, it’s so different from in towns. This is so clean and fresh, birds singing, hard for me to put into words what I am experiencing on this Adventure.I digress back to the travail, our hike today should be easy, we have just our packs with water, lunch, snacks and our waterproofs just in case. I am also carrying a first aid kit, just in case.The trail in this section is really wet, well flooded would be a better word. It is hard to stay out of the mud so it’s best just to walk up the center of the trail with the water coming up over your trail runner shoes.I wear Altra Timps and they have vents to let the excess water out well it’s supposed to, I think it lets it in as well????The trail apart from all the water is good and as we are s Slackpacking South we are meeting all the Northbound hikers. Kind of cool to meet so many people, tho yes it did slow my progress a bit. Well you have to talk to them a bit????There are some fantastic views on this trail, it’s so hard to pick a winner, but one place we passed today had a great view really short grass a tree to lean on and bonus gives you shade. If I had been on my own I would have grabbed a-quick snooze there it would have been perfect.We continue on up hill and down hill. We come across some hikers sat under a tree, there is a water source 3 tenths of a mile away, a bit far really, We are assured it is worth the hike down to the spring.This was by far the most beautiful spring I have ever seen it was perfect, plus the water was ice cold and tasted so good it was worth the walk.The rest of the trail was really good just a big up hill then a 2 mile down hill to the road and our pick up point, only our shuttle driver was gone. We waited a half an hour then thumbed. Ride into town it’s a 8 mile trip NO Walking.A young guy stopped and we load all our gear, just as this is is going down up pulls our driver, so we unload our gear and get into our shuttle car.

Dan is feeling good so we are making good time, the birds are all out singing the different aromas from the forest it is really cool.Dave decides to take the lead and soon disappears down the trail. It’s hard for him to slow his pace down, there are some great views from the overlooks. It’s a nice day for hiking not to hot with a bit of a cooling wind when we are on the weather side of the mountain.It’s not a bad climb to the top of the Priest Mountain, now we have a huge down hill section 3000 ft in just over a mile. Of course it is strewn with boulders of all sizes. I am looking around and go over on my ankle, it hurts like hell. If I was home I would baby it a bit but here you just have to walk it off, think it’s the best way actually.We get to the Tye River and retrieve our bags. OH this is a bit different with full packs and we have a big climb out of the valley 2000 ft in a half a mile, again lots of stones and boulders.But at last we get to our campsite at Harpers Creek Shelter. Dave has saved a site for our tents as he was ahead of us on the trail, tents are soon set up, it’s hard to find flat spots on the mountains, but it will have to do, just a little slope.We are all set up ready to make dinner. I am having a Mexican Rice and red bean dinner. This is another one of the batch that Juliet got for me, thanks Juliet they taste great and are very filling.Time now for coffee hang up the food away from the big ants and the Bears, get all my breakfast stuff ready for the morning and it’s time for bed after all it is 7:15 pm.So it’s Goodnight From me will see you in the morning.12.1 Miles28.185 Steps169 FloorsAnyone can walk on the flat ,but living on the edge is much Cooler.Only got 1354.9 miles to go to Mt Katahdin","Spy Rock Road

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591861,"Crazy BritAs usual I was in a really nice dream when I was woke up by David, get up we are on the move.I have all my stuff in its place in my tent. First thing is to pack up my sleeping bag, this fits into a compression bag and is strapped down to the size of a Canelope melon. Next is my liner this fits into a bag the size of a half can of beer. My sleep pad is next this is deflated and rolls up to the size of a full can of beer.All the above go in my pack followed by my Puffy jacket clean clothes, I can now take my pack out of the tent. Lighting my stove for coffee, put it on low and take down my tent packing it into to its own bag. Poles go down the inside of the pack with my pegs, tent on top all squashed down.By this time the water has boiled. I make my coffee put on the lid, pack up my cook set and my food sac, have my coffee and breakfast, tidy up my pack, ready to hit the trail 6:00am.That is how a Hikers day starts. Oh he may take some anti pain pills for the upcoming day, have a drink of water, here we go again, How Far Today???!!!!!!Well all that happened today, then we had to do a really nasty climb, 4 Miles up, up, up for just over two hours, hard work and came out to a great view, it was all worth it.The going got tough going over the rock fields, these are really dangerous and slippery these rocks move under your feet quite unnerving, Dan is doing really great doing good miles, we cross over the Blue Ridge Parkway, of course we were hoping for some trail magic, but alas No.We have to get water a couple of times thru the day. This is proper fresh water right out of a mountain spring, we always filter but it tastes so different, even I like it.We come out onto the parkway where we will get a ride to the hostel. We had to get dropped at a hotdog stand to change cars so we had hotdogs and fries with a coke.Then on to the Hostel a really cool place with every thing a hiker needs shower, laundry for smelly clothes, kitchen, food, nice bed, oh did I forget Cold Beer, perfect!Any way after having dinner a couple of beers it’s time for bed got 15 miles to walk then on Sunday we will be going into the Shenandoahs a great big step one that will put us just under halfway when get to Harpers ferry.Will report more tomorrow,Time for BedAnyone can walk on the flat , but it’s a lot more fun living on the edge","

The owner is a really cool guy, we are lucky.After I closed the journal last night we learned that Dans Mum had fallen and broken her hip, so today we are anxious to find out what’s happening in the big world.We start our hike at Dripping Rock and are heading to Rockfish Gap a distance of 14.3 miles. It’s a nice day with a forecast of rain in the afternoon, we are making good time David has gone on ahead, I am trailing Dan to make sure his Knee is doing good.We see David waiting for us. Sign on a tree tells us not to hike on your own due to bear activity. David is not taking any chances, not to many nasty climbs today, it makes a change I must say.Lunch is at the Paul C Wolfe Shelter, one of the better shelters has two floors and a covererd area over the picnic table, there is. Lady sat there she is out for the night and is all set up ready, great place to relax at.Great news Dan’s Mum is going to have a complete new hip. Having the procedure today, Saturday and will be coming home on Tuesday and up walking, absolutely amazing, great for her.Great news for Dan, this makes him feel a whole lot better. It is by now a pretty nice hike get a little rain shower but nothing to worry about or put on rain gear.We come out at the Rockfish Gap where we meet Dave sat drinking a Coke. We order a Coke and a Gatorade and sit and wait for our shuttle driver. He arrives and it's off back to Stanimal’s for a shower and wash our clothes which are rather smelly.Dinner tonight is Chinese at the all you can eat buffet, never seen so much food, of course we fill up on food a couple of beers and I am set we have to walk back to the Hostel.All is good Barbara is coming in tomorrow she will Slackpack us thru the Shenandoahs, this is a big step on our Adventure.Time for bed tomorrow we have a zero dayAnyone can walk on the flat but it’s more fun to live on the edgeOnly got 1327.9 miles to go to reach MT Katahdin","Dripping Rock

Awesome.We walk back to the Hostel and every one is chilling out. I Hate staying in on Sundays so I go off for a walk downtown, Waynesboro must have been hot hard in the Recession as there are lots of empty closed up stores and houses, even has a church for sale make a cool craft Brewery.I find a really nice coffee bar and have the best Latte. On the trip thus far, I send a photo to Dave and he is so jealous.We are staying at the Quality Inn tonight as David’s wife Barbara is coming up to Slackpack us thru the Shenandoahs.She has driven up from North Carolina. No time for rest we need to go to the Outdoor Store, then a coffee, then we can chill out, check our gear, make repairs, and rest a little.It’s started raining hard glad we are here in the Motel.Tomorrow we enter the Shenandoah Valley, a great step as I am told lots of Bears but thankfully not aggressive, lots of Deer and fantastic views.

Poor Dave missed it he was taking a leak and when he caught up to us the bears were gone.We are starting our Transit of the Shenandoah National Park Slackpacking with David’s Wife Barbara shuttling is from point to point, this way we still cover the miles but with lighter oaks so we can look around more and enjoy this park.Today is a really misty day no chance of seeing anything from the view points along the trail, plus the trail is wet and this makes the rocks very slippery.Dan had a very restless night and has decided to fly down to Bradenton tomorrow to get his Mother Motivated and get mobile after having her Hip Surgery. She has never really been in a hospital or had anything wrong with her in her 84 year life, makes for a Bad Patient!!!!! Ask the doctors at Lakewood Ranch Hospital.In the beginning of our hike today we are just a little under 3 miles an hour a great pace, but the AT is a great leveler. It throws in some steep climbs, muddy and steep, then to top it off it throws in really slippery flat rocks, placed so you cannot avoid standing on them .When you are confident about climbing over these they then stack them on top of one another so it’s even harder to traverse.We pass a lot of Hikers we have met before as today we are going South on the Trail instead of North. Great news we meet Spirit Man, haven’t seen him for at least a Month, he said that he is going to leave the trail at Harpers Ferry the halfway point as his wife’s Cancer is gradually getting worse and spreading, we will miss him on the Trail.We stop for lunch at a Meadow view site but it was fogged in bad, still sat on some rocks and enjoyed our Subway Sandwiches these are great and we get them whenever we have a chance.No more Bear sightings, so it’s just Hike, Hike through these Beautiful Forests. I tried to listen to my Music selection, it lasted about 30 mins, I found it hard to walk and not be able to listen to the forest sounds.We come to the place where you have to sign into to be able to hike and camp in the Shenandoah National Park, we don’t need one as we will not be camping.Barbara is waiting for us at the Rock fish Gap Concession stand, get a coke back to the hotel. Check on the Volvo around the World Race have a shower and beer, time for Dinner.Now back typing in bed, time for bed have to be up early tomorrow it’s a 18.5 Hike over rough terrain, hope to see some more Bears and Deer.Time to sleep14.4 miles35,348 Steps170 FloorsAnyone can walk on the Flat lands , but it is so much more fun to walk on the EdgeOnly got 1327.9 miles to go before we climb Mt Katahdin","Wildcat Trail

We stop and look then a Cub Casually walks across the trail, we are ecstatic, David has his Camera out shooting a video. I am taking photos, the Bears just keep an eye on us but just walk away, Awesome!!!!!!!!!!As we hike on we come across a couple checking out a trail map, we ask them where they are from they tell us Brisbane in Australia. Oh Dave says I know a guy from there, he tells them his name, turns out they know his daughters, Small World.We hike on and find a nice rocky place for lunch. Meet a couple of Hikers then it’s on got to get these miles down. We meet a hiker going South and he tells us about Trail Magic just up ahead.When we get to the sign it says it’s 150 yards up a side trail, then a debate starts is it worth the extra walk? Yes it is, we get to the camper and get a great welcome, there are several hikers that we know sat around we are offered hot dogs chips and a coke, they even have Rum, I am in Heaven.The two parents have a daughter and boyfriend hiking the trail and they are the support group, they are from Quebec, really nice people.We leave and soon we have only 4.2 miles to go. As we round a corner there is a deer walking down the trail, it just looks at us and nonchalantly walks into the forest.We arrive at the Ivy Creek Overlook and there is Barbara to meet us, we load our gear and head to the cafe for a milkshake, nice!!!!!Back to Motel have a shower go to dinner, going to be another early start tomorrow 5:30 am alarm call.Great hike today, will pay for it tomorrow.Anyone can walk on the flat ,but you know what it’s so much more fun to live on the EdgeOnly got 1295.6 miles before we summit Mt Katahdin","Wildcat ridge

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592500,"Crazy BritToday was a bad Weather day, thick hill fog all day no visibility at all from the view points. Plus it was raining on and off all day, lots of mud on the trail and very slippery.On the way to the Trail we saw 3 yearling Black Bears and a deer. On the trail we saw Squirrels, Chipmunks and a nice sized Black Snake. So far I have seen 7 black bears,I  never thought I would see so many.The trail is at the moment very muddy, and after tonight’s big rain storm is going to be flooded tomorrow. This is a problem, for as you start to hike you try to walk on the sides of the trail, this soon ends up being a real pain. So you end up just walking right up thru the flooded trail.Your shoes are soon soaked thru up to your ankles, the biggest problem is you cannot see the roots and stones under the mud, causing you to trip and stumble, it’s a real pain.I did a live FaceTime from one of the views, all you could see was white mountain fog a great pity as the views over the Shenandoah valley are spectacular.Another big deal today was that we went thru the 900 mile mark a really big deal, by the end of next week we will be over half way to Mt Katahdin.Our day was made up of climbing and descending the Shenandoah mountain range. We were heading to the South River Picnic Area, we were going to do 16.3 Miles.Today we are making a good pace allowing for the trail conditions, we are getting stronger every day, and can get 10 miles in by lunch time with no sweat. No bears on the trail today I expect they are curled up in their dens.We came out at the picnic area, and waited for Barbara to come pick us up. We knew she would be late as the roads are really foggy, we walked to the road and immediately got attacked by waves of knats, driving us crazy.Wasn’t long and our ride was here. Bonus a cold beer, this was much appreciated. Back to Motel shower and go to dinner.

I grab my phone to clear the alarm when I notice that it’s not the clock but a flood warning for our area.We go to breakfast and the local river has overflowed the river banks. It had rained all night really hard, if it’s flooded here in the valley, what will it be like up in the mountains.We are headed up into the mountains and the mist is already worse than it was yesterday, the water is running out of the ground all over the Skyline drive roadway, this looks bad.We eventually get to our point at South River picnic area, it was of course is raining there. There were some hikers there and one of them said he had slept in the toilet, to keep dry.I got on my rain jacket, no trousers as I am trying to hike in shorts no matter the weather, the trail is a river, water is everywhere, we started walking on the edge of the trail, trying to keep our feet dry, what a waste of time.It is safer to walk up the trail, just watch out for roots and stones. I am lucky that my shoes are good for walking in the water as they have vents on the sides to let the water out, works great for me.We are making great time even with the trail in this bad condition, as we are walking we come across some Deer. These are really tame up here as there is no hunting of any living creature, it makes a difference to the animals.Lunch was in a parking area on the Skyline road, only dry place around. We are making great time, more Deer are on the trail, we can get really close, both deer are heavily Pregnant and I should think are due at any day.We arrive at the Big Meadows Lodge and meet Barbara, I check out the Lodge really cool place.

Drove up to Big Meadows Lodge and saw Deer and 2 bears on the way ,it’s going to be a good day.We started off heading to our take out point at US 211 Thorntons Gap a distance of 17.6 miles good miles if the trail is good.We are very surprised even after the rain last night the trail is wet in places but as yet not enough to get your feet wet. We can walk on the trail sides to avoid the Mud and water, not like yesterday.We were told by the Rangers today that over 12 inches of rain fell in 2 1/2 Days, when a normal average would be 4 inches in 2 months, over 12 inches of rain is a hell of a lot of rain.This weather system has caused a lot of problems for the AT hikers. People that would have made it to Katahdin have had their hopes smashed by a freak year, Snow, Hail, Extreme cold and rain.We are lucky in that we can slack-pack, with Barbara, David’s wife. The whole way thru the Shenandoah’s some friends we have met are just tired of wet clothing, sleeping bags and tents, one girl said she was on flat ground, and had to sit and watch the water ride around her tent and others, then it just came over her Bathtub floor. “A Bathtub is a waterproof floor normally about 9 inches from the floor”.???The weather is every thing and we will find out after Harpers Ferry when our easy life ends. Tomorrow we will be hiking in rain all day, so the weather men say, it should stop by Monday Evening, so for us it’s not all sugar. Just I am lucky to have 2 people who have done it before and know most of the good things to do.The views today are awesome. We are hiking down a narrow ridge so we have sometimes views on either side. Lunch was spent in the company of Spirit Man a really nice guy, he has told us he will finish in Harpers Ferry and go home to look after his Wife who has Cancer. He has had some tough times on the trail, but he is always there plodding along one step in front of the other, we will miss him.Hiking was good and we are soon in that time when you check your Guthook App and find you are only 6 tenths away from your take out point. This distance feels like damn miles and miles, it’s a long way down from the ridge seems to take ages.In an instant we are out from the Forest and onto a paved car park.

I have heard of horror stories, but if you do not provoke the Bear you are ok.The visibility is again zero with no views at the overlooks, so disappointing as the Shenandoah Valley is such a cool place to see. Tomorrow is going to be just like today except we will have rain. We are only doing 11.5 miles so should be done by lunchtime.Today is not a good day to see the wildlife of Shenandoah National Park. They must all be curled up in their homes out of this sucky weather. The undergrowth is all soaking wet with no chance of drying out for the next week. David has been telling me how great their milk Shakes are in the Wayside cafes, so today we are timing it so we can go in at lunchtime and get shake and eat our lunch.
We arrive at the Elkwallow Wayside, and are ready for our shakes. Barbara is here waiting for us so we can have lunch together. David is first in line orders an Egg Sandwich and a Strawberry shake for himself. You should have seen his face when the lady said Ed cannot make Shakes today, we had walked extra miles just for the Milk shake and are crushed.The rest of our hike was pretty normal up ,down, up down 
With Zero Visibility, no views to marvel at, plus no thru hikers to talk to.

North is South bound today is a wet muddy day, hiking the opposite way from all the North bound hikes is kind of cool because you meet a lot more people.Most of the people we are meeting today are old friends by now and it’s good just to see and hear how they are all getting on. We are putting little toys out on the trail to see where they will end up. We have green frogs, yellow ducks, and an assortment of different colored fish. We get them in the Dollar General store in the baby section.
We write our trail names on them with a message, hopefully a hiker will find them and keep them going up to Maine and Mt Katahdin, we now have people looking out for them, it fun and passes the time.Talking about time today was a real early start 5:50 am. Got to get going as it’s a 20 mile day, all is going good maintaining a steady hiking speed, even in the gooey mud.We are told that there is trail magic up ahead this always puts a spring in your step.

This section includes the dreaded Roller Coaster, big ups and downs for about 10 miles. Some are really steep with big rocks all over the trail, I suppose it’s getting us ready for the trail in Pennsylvania.Well we come to a sign welcoming us to the Roller Coaster, but first we have to cross a stream then up we go. D 2 in front then Uncle D then myself, who ever designed this part of the Trail was a Sadist.The miles were coming down, this is a big section as we will go thru the 1000 mile Barrier!!!!!We have set our phone App Guthook so we know the exact point on the trail, we are getting excited as we approach the mark. No need to worry there on the trail marked out in stones is the 1000 mile mark we stop for lunch as it’s a convenient place to sit. I was really excited at the first 100 mile mark, but this is Monument-us hard to think we have come all this way and are still just under halfway.We still have a fair bit of the roller coaster to do and we come out onto a great viewing point at Bears Den Rocks, time for a photo shoot.

The people putting on this feast has a daughter and she is just a few miles behind us, she is in for a great surprise when she gets here.Barbara takes us to their daughters house, time to shower, go out to dinner, then food shop.Tomorrow is another big day we are hiking 19.3 miles into Harpers Ferry the home of the Appalachian Trail Conservatory and this is where we will have our photo taken, this will then go on the year book.With so much excitement I am going to Bed Goodnight.Anyone can walk on the flat, but no Flat places around here, but it’s more exciting to live on the edge anyway.13.9.

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593269,"Crazy BritYet another great day of hiking with great company. We got an early start from Snickers Gap, our target was Harpers Ferry, this is the Headquarters of the Appalachian Trail Conservatory.We started out real well, everybody was feeling good, we still had to do about 3 miles of the roller coaster, not to rough just enough to make you feel your alive.Once these climbs were over it became a pleasant hike the type people think the whole AT is like, nice path with big trees shading you from the sun.This did not last long we were soon walking over a rock strewn path, these are really tough, your feet are never stable, your knees take a real pounding especially on the downhill sections, no one likes these.We come to a rock outcropping called Raven Rocks, I decide to do a Live Facetime with the added bonus of John Denver singing West Virginia. This was done because we had crossed over into this State 3.2 Miles Back, we used Dans phone for the Music and mine for filming the view, came out real good.We soon get to a point where we can see the Shenandoah River, it’s in full flood, hope the foot bridge is open. We cross over the river on the US 340 Road Bridge, the traffic is crazy the commuters coming home from Washington, after we cross over we are only 1.5 miles out from Harpers.The walk into town is an easy one just a short climb at the beginning, we follow the white blazes and are soon in the bottom of Main street, time for a milk shake. We go down to check on the river, both the Shenandoah and the Potomac meet here.Barbara arrives and we drive up to the ATC to register and get out photos taken to go in the year book.

Had a lazy breakfast a few coffees then drove into Harpers Ferry, we did the history tour in lower town.This was the major arms manufacturing place in the USA and it was started by a Brit YES a BRIT in 1774 and the town grew because it was on the confluence of the Potomac and the Shenandoah Rivers so they could generate power cheaply.The town grew rapidly and was a major manufacturer of Arms and Ammunition, specializing in Rifles and pistols.In 1859 on October 16th John Brown led a raid with 21 men on the main Armory and took it over, and the Army caught him 2 days later on the 18th and he was hung on December the 8th.This was one of the actions that led up to the Civil war, and the well known song “John Browns body lies a mouldering in his grave” was penned from this action.The town built on the hillside reminds me of an English fishing village, a really interesting place lots of history, all of the above information I knew nothing of.Had lunch in a great restaurant with good food and beer, by this time Barbara was ready to pick us up, she had been to lunch with one of her friends from the NOC.Now it was time for shopping to get our food and bits and pieces for our start back on the trail tomorrow.

I was hoping my shoes would last another 200 miles but now not so sure.We are meeting such cool people from all walks of life. Today we were hiking with a mother and her two sons one is 13 the other is 9 years old, they are carrying their own packs, real nice kids. We make it to the campsite set up our tents and what do you know there is a restaurant just up the trail. This will beat a Subway sandwich so we walk up and have a great dinner and a few beers, now back at the camp site, have a coffee and time for bed after all its almost 9:00 pm and we will be up and gone by 5:30 am.Goodnight see you tomorrow Anyone can walk on the flat, but its so much more fun to walk on the edgeOnly got 1148.6 miles to go before we summit Mt Katahdin","Harpers Ferry

Great day of hiking apart from lots and lots of rocks must be getting us in shape for Pennsylvania.We got a nice early start left the campsite at 6:05am, nice to get a good start to the day.About 2 miles out we came to the Washington Monument we stopped for a photo op. Really cool place lots of History here. On the road to the monument there are boards with all of Washington’s life written on them. No wonder he is so revered by the American people the tower is only about 50 ft tall built of stone, and has extensive views over the Maryland countryside, we were there early so no visitors were there, had the whole place to ourselves.We were making really good time until we hit all the rocks, this really slows you down, you have to be careful as you could easily hurt yourself then end your trip.We were going to look at the Annapolis rocks but it would have ment a Hike of trail down hill of a half a mile, to far for us, so we sat on the trail and had lunch. The bugs are out in force now got some bug spray, but I think it just attracts them and it’s Deet.We stop by a nice stream to replenish our water, we thought it was the stream by our campsite, but no the stream is still half a mile away, and of course it’s up hill, from here it’s 1 3/4 miles to the campsite, this is really uphill, one of the hardest climbs so far.We arrive at our destination for today really tired these climbs at the end of the day are especially hard. Set up our tents and cook our dinners, thanks again Juliet it was delicious. A nice cup of coffee and I am ready for bed.See you in the morning

I have on my wet pants and top, got a little sweaty, but as we crested the climb it got really misty and a bit cold I was glad I put them on.It’s supposed to start raining again in a couple of hours, this will make it a bit slippery on all the Rock piles, I know I have said it before but if there is a rock pile the AT will go right over it every time.We have a steady hike just taking one break at the two hour time, we have a good pace going even over all those Damn rocks! Rocks all over the place and it’s only going to get worse, I have been up to the northern end of Pennsylvania and I know how rocky that is, Great!!!!This being a 9.3 mile day we are finished early and first thing we do is to go to Timbers Restaurant to eat. Good food and great coffee. Just down the road is the Hostel we are going to it’s called the Trail of Hope Hostel. Run by a church Ministry, great place nice and clean with hot showers, just what a hiker needs. I had a nap, then we ordered Italian take out, delicious even had a Desert of Tiramisu a good choice.Now it’s up to bed do my journal, get my gear ready, try to dry my boots a bit, stuffing them with newspapers, seems to work ok.Love these short days you can get the miles in then relax a bit.

The trail is in good shape today it’s dried up a lot after the big storms.We are walking along a nice ridge line not to many ups and downs so we can make good miles. We pass the Quarry Gap Shelter, this has to be the best Shelter we have seen so far, it has Caretakers that comes in every day to tend the flowers. Yes he has put up hanging baskets and flowers all out in the front of the shelter, even has a little wishing well.There were a couple staying there celebrating their one year wedding Anniversary, they even got married in the park and had their wedding night at the shelter.Time to carry on heading ever North, we have lunch at the Birch Run Shelter, another well kept place. I can’t believe the trail just has a few small muddy spots here and there, as we come out on to the Shippenburg road there are two sets of Trail Angels set up Hamburgers, Hotdogs, Drinks. One of the guy’s started his Thru hike the same day as Dan and finished within a couple of him but they didn’t recognize each other.As we carried on David picked up a set of keys, we met a guy walking towards us and guess what they were his. At this time we were looking for the Midpoint of the AT, the guy informed us that we had in fact just passed it, couldn’t believe it.So we walked back sure enough there was a little sign. Apparently the older grand looking sign complete with flags got burnt down in a forest fire, the remains we can see all around us.So on we go to the Toms Gap Shelter, not as grand as the last two and it’s only a four person deal just right for us.Time for a coffee and some dinner, collect some water and I am all set think I will have a Hot Chocolate before bedtime, got to get my journal done.I have called Janice she was supposed to be going out with Greg and Alice Hobie and Mary to Celebrate our Wedding Anniversary, But she is not feeling good with her Bronchitis, so she will be a lonely girl at home in bed, so sorry sweetheart.Now it’s time for a Hot Chocolate then Bed.Goodnight allLike I always say Anyone can walk on the flat , but is sure more fun living on the EdgeOnly got. 1091.1 miles to go before Mt Katahdin","US 30 Fayetteville

Very interesting place, we spent some time there, on we go up the trail it is still raining a little, but that just keeps you cool, good for hiking.We are heading towards the Alec Kennedy Shelter it’s supposed to rain again during the night, it’s a hard hike today lots of Rock piles and of course the White blazes go right over the hardest places, if you are following me on face book you will see what I mean.It’s a long 19 miles to the shelter very rough.

At this time I have to give a big shout out to my two Hiking Buddies Oh and Barbara Daves Wife. Without these two guys it would have been very very hard to accomplish what I have at the moment. They are setting the pace, I feel really strong and I know we will make it to Mt Katahdin baring any stupid accidents.

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594235,"Crazy BritHad a really great morning of hiking from the shelter above, up to Carlisle. We were hiking mostly thru farm land, lots of Corn and Mazes. It still baffles me that the famous AT Trail is about 8 inches wide and only a couple of inches deep after all the hikers that have gone thru these sections.The highlight of the day was coming into Boiling Springs, what a cool town. My first sight was coming over a bridge and there was a guy Fly fishing fog trout mesmerizing watching him, he was good, one of my favorite things to do.I sat beside the lake and waited for the others to catch up, I wasn’t sure where the Cafe, coffee shop was, they soon came and we walked around the lake and went to the cafe.There were a few hikers there already they told us we were in for a treat. Boy they were right, great food and coffee, I was hungry so I had 2 eggs bacon, home fries, wheat toast, and two large pancakes. These were large portions, I eat all mine David was stuffed and left some, 3 Cups of coffee I felt Great.Just down the road was an Outfitters with the Best Fly Fishing section I have seen in the USA. The staff were great you could tell they loved their jobs at the store. The guy said he was going fishing on the way home after work, nice and helpful, told me to come back when I am not so busy???Just across the road is the Appalachian Mid - Atlantic regional office so we went in got my passport stamped, another nice person running this office, I like this town.We left town walking up a road to rejoin the AT Trail saw a sad sight a dead deer in the hedge such a beautiful animal, good to be back in the woods to a much slower pace even tho the town was slow, cars still wiz by.Today Dan introduced me to Mulberries they were so good, we found lots of trees full of berries, so after I tasted my first berries I was hooked. Of course they are pretty small but they certainly taste oh so good.We came across a small grave yard, it was so sad to see the grass and weeds overtaking the graves, the oldest we could read was in 1773, hell those Brits were still in charge then.The sun was out great day hiking, we are heading to Carlisle for a hotel, shower and wash clothes they are a bit smelly.Talk about showers it’s kind of embarrassing, having a shower and seeing all the trail dirt going down the plug hole.Had a shock after getting our room I decided I had earned a cold beer, so I walked to the gas station with Dave to get my reward. To be told I would have to walk about another 1 -1/2 miles to buy a beer. Now I really needed one Dave said your on your own so off I went in search of the elusive Pennsylvanian Beer. This is Stuipid I had to walk 3-1/2 miles to buy 2 - 6 packs of beer Bud Light 10$ per 6 pack it’s a PA rip off, big yes.I had come so far so bought them sucker!!!!!!!Time for dinner so must close, got a good hike tomorrow into Dunncannon P A.

What a Day had a really good Hike thru lots of Farmland, and then into the Rock piles, these are just crazy you could hurt yourself really bad if you slipped and fell from the trail.There are a number of viewpoints along the way. It’s nice to be able to see the rich farm land of Pennsylvania spread out in front of you. I never get tired of these as you can see from my Facebook Photos.We got some great Trail Magic on PA 850, ome really nice Husband and Wife with their Daughter in Law and a really cute 4 1/2 year old little girl. They had all the good stuff, burgers, hotdogs, water melon, cookies, Cokes and Gatorade, they had done their homework, thank you.There was a great view of Duncannon from the Hawk Rock View point. This town is a bit on the sad side, all of the manufacturers have closed down, it was here that they built the Glider hand carts and all associated garden stuff.I was meeting up with the guys at the famous Doyle Hotel, we met in the bar, man this place has seen better days, it’s falling down and really dirty, it was once a high class place, sadly it’s on its last legs. David didn’t want to stay, Dan said it would be an experience not to be missed.The whole building is in a really bad state of repair, I refused to have a shower it was so bad. To ease the discomfort I went and bought a bottle of Jack Daniels, and some Cokes, DN got the ice, and we sat on the balcony and drank it, highly Illegal but it tasted all the better for it.

Dan wants to Slack pack today, so David and myself head out to the Trail. It's a long way to get there over a mile and a half.It’s a hard climb to get to the top of the ridge, really rough and rocky, it’s hard on the feet and knees. There are some great views again today, can’t get enough of these, seen a couple of deer today they are white tails.Today we again had some Trail Magic just the right stuff that hikers need, and as an added bonus the site they chose was on PA 325 right on a beautiful River. And as an added bonus he had a fly rod, and he let me have a go. Loved it never caught a fish but had a great time.One last hill for the day I hate these hills at the end of the day, plus it a high mileage day.

A useful tip to save weight in your pack, take out the wet cloths and dry them out, then when you want one just wet it with water and it is as good as new.Only had two big long climbs today and a couple of fairly long rock piles to clamber over. I know it gets boring telling everyone about the rocks and I know from my visit to Pennsylvania last year testing gear, that it’s going to get worse, but we should be out of PA next week with luck.We had to cross a swamp today, made by Beavers, cute little buggers until they make a Lake right across the AT Trail. This was a real pain to cross, I was going to take a video but thought better of it. I was pretty deep and muddy. Beavers are pretty smart dam builders, someone said they are going to have to move the trail.Again today we met another Trail Angel parked in the Swatara Gap car park, really cool guys had ice cold drinks, cookies and candy, he had never been a hiker just likes to help out, he also walks up the trail a mile either side of the Gap picking up litter just to keep his part of the forest clean. He also asked us about the Beaver dam and said they might have to get a horse in there to break it up, thank you sir.Well we have made it to our campsite all hot and sweaty, going to do a 19 mile day tomorrow, so we will only have a short 9 mile day into Hamburg and a hotel with a shower, laundry and a beer or two.Had my dinner, now time for a Hot Chocolate and Bed.Anyone can walk on the flat, but it’s more fun clambering over rocks and living on the edge in Pennsylvania.OH Yes another big thing we are only 00.2 miles away from being under a 1000 miles before we summit Mt Katahdin","1169.3 campsite

We are camping tonight so we set up our tents, still no one comes in. Then at about 4:00pm the young guys start to come in, they had stopped at the pub and a customer who had hiked the trail put down two $50.00 bills and bought every one a couple of beers.

We pass a lot of tents and hammocks all set up, you can tell the youngsters on the trail, no movement from the tents, they are not early risers, the older guys are up having coffee and wave to us as we go by.We are by now on a big descent into The Lehigh Gap and looking across we can see the Rock climb that we have to do tomorrow, yes Climb not Hike. It’s 1 1/2 Miles into Palmerton our destination for tonight we have to pick up My New shoes and glasses that are being shipped into Berts Restaurant, they have a hostel at the back of the Restaurant, so tomorrow we can Slackpack over the Palmerton Superfund site. Years ago all the bluff behind Palmerton was devoid of Vegetation, poisoned by the Zink smelting just outside of town, the toxic fumes and vapors killed the whole mountain.The site was awarded a Superfund status and it is gradually getting some trees back, I will try and find out when this happened???We get a ride into town with not much trouble, they are used to hikers in this small town, it’s not that small it has two sets of traffic lights !!!!! We head to errs to check in and have a big fried breakfast, now to rest up for the day, you have to get a break sometime.Got a beer and listened to some live music also did a bit of shopping, if your a thru hiker you get a free apple of your choice, the owner says an apple a day keeps the doctor away, neat guy.Going to get dinner soon, then another beer, can’t have to much as it’s another 20 plus mile tomorrow, have to get some good sleep.Have to close now, I am sat in a nice public park in the center of town, and don’t want to get arrested as a homeless Vagrant, although I look like one.Anyone can walk on the flat , but it’s more fun to live on the edge avoiding getting arrested for Vagrancy.Only got 931 miles to go before we summit Mt Katahdin","Bake Oven Knob

It still takes 45 mins to drive out to Wind Gap, so it’s 9:00 am before we start which means we will be finished about 6:00 pm tonight, oh my a long day.As expected the trail is really rough lots of rocks, most of them standing on edge just to catch you out and hurt your toes, this happens a lot.We are headed back to Lehigh Gap and Palmerton, the temperature is pretty good, it’s supposed to rain, this is definitely what we don’t want, this is going to make the rocks even more slippery than they normally are.As we are Slackpacking today we are going in a south direction so we are meeting all our hiking friends, which is pretty cool, the message comes along the trail that there is Trail Magic about 4 miles ahead, we are hoping that it will still be there when we get there. Time is not on our side, but we plod on hoping.Then we come out of the forest and there it is Trail Magic, Awesome! Coke, Beer, plenty of food, these young guys are awesome, two of them have hiked the AT, so they know what hikers need and they have it all. Dave has a Coke, I have a beer, we go only got 8 miles to go.Our hike now is up over the Superfund site this whole area was stripped with the Zink waste from the facility in the valley. The trail leads all along the ridge over looking the valley, this facility is huge.Eventually we arrive at the big descent of the day at Lehigh Gap, we eat some food on top, make some phone calls, then head down, No need for poles as you need both hands to climb down, this is an insane part of the trail. One slip and you're dead. We thankfully make it down in one piece, then try to again hitch into town. A cop is on the shoulder of the road so no cars will stop, it’s illegal to hitch hike in PA.So we walk the 1 1/2 Miles into town, this means a 24 mile day.

The wether was great first thing nice and cool.We are managing to get the miles down, even tho we both think this is one of the worst sections for all the rocks in the trail. When that is done you have to contend with boulders that the trail goes right over, potentially very dangerous ankle or leg breakers.There are several really nice views of the farmland in this part of Pennsylvania, we are going to meet Adam Otterbach in Delaware water gap. Last time I saw him he was 9 years of age I am checking out all the guys coming up the trail.Its a long way down to the Water Gap from the ridge top, we are passing lots of day hikers going up to the great view, from on top of the ridge.Not far from the bottom a tall young man gives a call, its Adam.

We still have loads of rocks on the trail, with just one or two rock fields to traverse.On this section there are lots of short up and downs, so just as you are getting into your stride, you have to slow for a climb or descent, this makes it a lot harder to get going up to our normal speed.We are soon on the descent to the US206.

Great day hiking it was going to be a 20 mile day, it had rained all night lots of thunder, we expected the trail to be flooded but it was in good condition .We had a shuttle ride up to the State Park HQ, from there it was obviously a big climb out as it always is at the start of a hiking day. Dave took a fall on the Slippery Rocks, and got a nasty cut on his hand.It started to rain so we put on our wet gear, then 10 mins later it stopped so took gear of, this happened a couple of times during the day.The trail was up and down all the time this is hard going as the rocks are wet and slippery, we do get good sections of trail can even see Dirt, such a change. By 12:00 mid day we have got 12 miles in great.There are a lot of board walks thru the forest over the boggy parts, and there are a lot of them, the going is better now, I am leading walking over the boards when a fly goes in my eye, I trip over my trekking pole and over I go. Dave said it was a good fall and gave me a mark of 9 out of 10, me I am upside down bum in the water and my left arm is numb.Damn is it broke or something, no I just hit my funny bone, not funny really at all. Dave helps me up, have to be more careful, the trail builders have done a great job building these walks.We come to Walkhill Reserve we have to walk all around this park , pointless miles when we could have walked up the road, then just walk in 200 yards and get to the same place, another BIG climb this one is tough it goes on for ever tough climb.We arrive at a section where there is a really nice board walk, some of the walk has been renewed. We met a guy who was using a Weed Wacker trimming the undergrowth along side the walk another volunteer, just helping out the AT .Our destination is in sight, we need cold drinks and ice cream. We really wanted a Milkshake but their machine is broken, in fact it’s been broken for the past 18 months. So we have Coke floats very tasty, then some ice cream, in come 3 more of our hiker friends, more ice cream. Our shuttle driver arrives and we give one of the hikers “We’ll See” a ride to the store to replenish his food supply.Then it’s back to the house into the shower, wash the clothes, have a beer, and out to downtown to get dinner. Had a great meal, I forgot my phone and was worried I had left it in the Jeep, but all was well after calling my phone lots of times it was on the table with my papers.Back to house, have a beer and time for bed, Goodnight Anyone can walk on the flat, but to be really cool try walking on the Edge you will thank me .Only got 832.9 miles to go before the big one at Mt Katahdin","High Point State Park HQ.

Tough climb out again today, but the good thing was it was pretty cool temperature wise had to wear a extra shirt and my rain jacket, but half way up the climb I had to strip them of back to just a tee shirt, I was sweating so much.The Trail was lots of ups and downs we had 16.3 to go to our campsite at Stony brook Campsite, but we are hoping for some Trail Magic at one of the road crossings, one of the hikers called Sublime his parents were coming to collect him for a few days off trail so they were going to set up to do Trail Magic, Awesome.As we were approaching Bulls Bridge Road our hopes were up then from the forest we could see a pop up tent with some people standing around, YES Trail Magic.They had everything even New Darn Tough Socks, Hats and all the food. Sublime Mum made the best sandwich, had doughnuts for desert, candy bars, even beer and all the drinks, a really good spread, thank you so very much From all the Hikers.Of course we waited for Sublime to arrive, that was pretty cool to see, when we left we had another Monster climb out, which was pretty hard going the rest of the trail was pretty good except for St Johns Ledges, these were really steep steps full of loose rocksThen we came down to the Housatonic river from here it was just a flat walk to our campsite at Stony Brook, set up our tents and made our dinner got water, going to be early to Bed the Mosquitoes are eating us alive.So goodnight see you tomorrow.anyone can walk on the flat , try walking on the Edge you may be Surprised Only got 714.9 miles to go befor we climb Mt Katahdin","Ten Mile Shelter

It’s a tough trail with about 4 long steep climbs, the first was up from the river, in between these climbs we have lots of short steep climbs which really test your legs.At one time thru the trees we can see a motor racing track way down in the valley, you could here the engines being warmed up, no time to watch from here, that’s a pity but we have to press on with our hike.David has called Hudson the owner and we are on time for our ride, up down, up down all day, with a big descent down thru the huge Pine Trees to the US 7 Highway. When we get there we have to walk all around a huge corn field.This little Trail deposits is right into the car park where we will get our ride, we take off our packs and sit on the ground, in just a few minutes Hudson arrives and brings us to his home.They are closed at the moment but because David has stayed here before they are letting us stay here, we will do some Slack packing tomorrow, and maybe the next day, get us rested for tackling the White Mountains later on our trip.This Hostel is Awesome they usually only take 8 hikers at a time, we get shown our bunks, beautiful showers, our clothes are taken away and laundered for us. They have a honest system so if you need anything to eat from the stock that is on the counter, you just write it down, in fact they have this system on all the better class of Hostels.I am now sat in the garden writing my Journal sipping a beer which the owner just brought out.

Just a couple of little climbs we pass some really nice homes, very clean looking New England style, we pass Falls Village pity the Coffee Shop was closed on a Monday as they have a British Motor Cycle Museum there, maybe next time????The Water falls are next, these are awesome and you can get right on top and look down, would love to see this when there is a lot of rain it would be a sight to behold. We spend some time there as today we are in no hurry it’s only a 9.3 mile day so we will be done by lunch time with no problem.The hike continues to be good, great trail one of the best days yet, with no pressure on us to get to a campsite.There is a long descent thru a pine forest to the road leading into Salisbury, we have to walk the quarter of a mile into town along the road, we have now learned that there is a Tail to Trails pathway leading right into town, will do this tomorrow when we are Slackpacking South.We enter the town which is really smart very clean and Quaint, there is a nice looking coffee shop so we sit outside on the sidewalk under an umbrella drinking a Latte, watching the world go by, no hurry, we have a look around the town then head to the food store to check out for re-supply tomorrow, nice store, with New England Prices.We meet up with one of our Trail group he is in on a re-supply mission. There is a nice Bistro next door so we sit in the shade of a big tree and plan our next section, we will pass him going South tomorrow.Time to be picked up and taken back to Bearded Woods when we get back I have a nap didn’t feel to good.

We have 16.5 miles to do and we are told it will be like a 25 mile day, this climb out takes a lot of work especially as there is no chance to warm up on some flat stuff first.The first climb is up to the summit of Mt Bushnell, as soon as we are up we are on our way down, then it’s up again to the summit of Mt Everett this is a tougher climb. There is a picnic area part way up with two five gallons of iced water and about 10 one gallon jugs to refill them.It’s a big down then we have to get ready for Bear Mountain the summit is the highest point in Connecticut, it’s a hard climb, in many places you are going hand over hand up an almost vertical slab of rock, this will surely get us in shape for the whites.There are several big groups of young people hiking north, hope they can find room to all camp on the trail, we may see them again tomorrow when we are hiking North, it looks like they were in different camps of some sort.Bear Mountain has a pile of stones on top that you can stand on and enjoy the view, it’s all down from here to the Cobble Road, then a short walk along an old railway line into the center of town. David is off to the ice cream parlor for a milkshake. I have to go to the bank then get some resupply stuff for tomorrow’s hike.I follow David to get a milkshake, but they are almost out of ice cream, no flavors I like, so I go to the Bistro and have a beer to cool me down perfect.

Great day started with a great breakfast of French Toast, scrambled eggs, steak and watermelon.We got all our gear packed, ready for the trail, loaded up with water and we are ready to start.Big Lou is going to take us to the trail head today, so we load all our gear get a photo and we are all ready, it’s about a 35 min ride out to our starting point today, and we are told the first 3-4 miles are going to be easy and flat.For once they seemed to be right, good trail, nice conditions, but we know this cannot last, then the climbs start, not to much at first then they get progressively steeper and longer, back to normal up down, up down, this seems quite normal now, you can almost tell by the down hill you are doing what the uphill on the other side will be.The one good thing is there are less rocks now on the trail, but this lack of hundreds of rocks has been taken up by hundreds of tree root systems, these are nicer and slippery, Oh and they love to trip you up, ask Dave.There are not a lot of big views today, we have a snack sat by a bridge over the Housatonic River, this is where I will do my morning FaceTime with everyone I love to do this as people can share my adventure.We are coming down to MA 23 where we will be picked up and shuttled to a Hostel in Sheffield for the night, on today’s hike there are a lot of plank walkways, we walk on them, but where these are there is no water at the moment no rain.We come out at the road and only have to wait a few minutes for our ride, on the way to town I ask if there is a bar I could watch the World Cup match England -Croatia, so we search around for a bar, I can’t find one, then my phone goes it’s David they have found a bar for me.I get dropped of at the Bar, Bogies, and go in only to be met by 6 men and one woman all dressed in England team shirts, and best of all I get pointed to the Bass Ale “ Nivrana”. All is going good we are one up the place is jumping, beer is flowing, they have opened an hour early for the game. Then Croatia scored heads are a bit down, the game is in extra time second period, those Bas...da score again it’s over England are out.

Had a great breakfast then got shuttled out to the Trail head where we will Slack pack back to the pick up point on MA 23.On the ride out we pass some Beautiful New England style homes, and we are only just in the state, our drop off point allows us to walk for about a mile on the valley floor mostly on Walk boards these keep us out of the marshy area.Of course on the walk out we can see looming over us another what looks like a big climb, but this turns out to be not too bad, and the best thing the bugs are not out as its to cold for them.The hike is great, there were just 3 climbs and these were not too bad, not like we are used to. Wow we are knocking the miles off going great and still no damn bugs, life is good.We come to a fantastic Beaver pond with two Lodges on it. These animals are so smart, when they fell a tree it always falls right into the pond so they can eat the tasty branches in safety of the water. We look at a couple of tree stumps that they have felled, these are big trees, plenty of food for them.The dam that they have constructed is amazing big logs then smaller branches then leaves and mud to seal it. They leave a gap in the dam wall for water to run out so there is movement in the pond and it will not get stagnant, clever animals.Our hike is taking us down thru a pine forest the pine needles are all over the floor makes it nice and cushioned, except when they are laid over flat rocks on a descent, very slippery.We are only doing 12.2 miles as this will set us up for a 9 mile hike into Upper Goode Pond, so we will get a Nero there be able to swim and paddle around in the Canoes that they have there. So by 1:15 pm we are done, we call for our ride then go into town to get some re- supply we need.We get back to the Hostel have a shower and a nap, time for dinner, we have found a great place, in this little town, there is a live show from my local Hiker club Trailwalkers Gear in Bradenton Florida so I watch that for an hour, getting some stuff sent to me to test so now its just to pack my backpack ready for tomorrow, and get some sleep .GoodnightAnyone can walk on the flat , but it takes more energy and its more worthwhile to walk on the Edge gor a bitOnly got 648.5 miles to go before Mt Katahdin","Main Road Tyringham MA

Before we get to the hiking have to tell you what happens I Great Barrington to David. Him and Jess were sat outside a store waiting for me to get back from Subway, when I arrived they both got out of these strings chairs. A guy walked by then stopped and just waited, hanging around looking in the store window, David got in the car and immediately found out that his wallet was missing, he got out of the car walked about six ft to the chair and the guy was sat in the chair, David asked him if he had his wallet, the guy looked in his bag took out the wallet and gave it to David. Bold as brass and said he was going to give it to him. What a low life he must have seen the wallet on the floor and he was waiting for us to go.Back to our hiking.Another cool temp day, obviously a bit of a climb first thing, but its very enjoyable in this temperature, no bugs flying in your eyes , or trying to get in your ears, we have only got a short 7.1 miles to go to get to Upper Goose Pond.Its a great hike thru a lot of Pine forests, lots of pine needles to cushion your feet. No big climbs today just gentle climbs, a nice hike with very little effort. I called Janice this morning she said I should walk faster and a lot more miles, I am going to have to bring her out hiking one day, could be fun. As we are descending, we have to walk along the edge of the pond, actually its a nice lake, surrounded by the forests.The trees come right down to the lake side, it looks great now, it would look awesome with the trees covered in snow and the lake frozen over, the AT Trail Cabin is set back on a bluff overlooking the lake.This is an awesome place the Cabin sleeps 14 people up stairs in a bunk room, they also have room for tenting on wooden platforms you can cook your meals out the back, and they have a communal lounge dining room. There is a big porch with rocking chairs, best of all they have a pancake and coffee breakfast cant wait for that one.David and I sign out a canoe and paddle around the lake, such a treat, wish I had a fishing pole. When we get back to the dock we are ready for a swim, its a bit cold but very refreshing. Now its time to chill out and enjoy the view.Tomorrow we are going to meet up with some Trail friends Matt Paddy and Tea pot, we are going to have dinner with them looking forward to that, they are following my journal to find out our position, I have to text them our eta at a certain road junction.So another day on the trail is coming to a close, and I have the perfect view from my little dock on the lake.

Now we have a problem one of the windows are broke on the top, not allowing it to close all the way the door was still open and the wind was blowing right on my bunk.So when I closed the door the wind stopped with the pressure in the room bug the damn wind howled all night all around the door, very noisy, not a good nights sleeping I am afraid.Because of the storms we had decided to start later in the morning at about 7:30 am, we went down for coffee we were told it was a Continental Breakfast. So we decided to take advantage as it was free, well we waited for ages, of course we were missing hiking time to get off the mountain before another big storm hit forecasted for 2:00pm.Well what came out was little blueberry Muffins, we obviously thought this was the first of the food, well what a disappointment it turned out to be. Although they were just out of the oven and tasted good, we had wasted time that turned out to be a really bad thing, still the four of us eat the lot.We get our packs and head out we are the first to leave, it was a big descent at first lots of rocks but pretty good going, then about a third of the way down it started to drizzle a bit, we were passing thru the valley mist, so no problem.Well that was until the thunder started, then rain showers, still no problem, then the lightning started, time to get into my waterproofs. Down it came soon the trail started to flood, then the up to now streams that were dry started to fill. Our phones went of on the emergency channel ,Danger Flash Food Warning.Great things are literally going down hill pretty quick. At this time I was a long way ahead of Dave, so for safety reasons I stopped and waited for him, he had fallen twice, lucky no harm done, on we went. Water was now running down the trail the run off channels were overwhelmed, so you just have to walk down the trail with muddy rainwater over the top of your shoes .The Lightning was all around us, banging and crashing. The Thunder was right over our heads, no point in stopping, plus there is no shelter this far down the mountain. Soon we came out into the town of Williamstown and make our way to the Williamstown Hotel. The owner said he could do our washing, so off with our wet gear into the shower, things are looking better, this was a stupid mistake as we would have been off the mountain before the storm had hit.Chilled out had a nap, now just got back from dinner, time to do my journal then bed.

Problem came at lunch when we found out we had bought the wrong tortillas. We had picked up the in cooked version so it was just dough, didn’t work as a wrap also tasted like crap, lot of weight for nothing, got some good advice from one of the hikers so will try another avenue.Today’s hike was a bit muddy after yesterday’s thunderstorm, only to be expected. The streams are all running pretty good so our water sources are more frequent now, and it’s good water after it has been treated. We were met in Vermont by some real nasty climbs, lots of water on the trail.We are also seeing a lot of SOBO hikers “South Bound"" hikers now they started at Mt Katahdin and will finish at Springer Mountain, they ask us how is it in the South we of course want to know about up North. We are camped tonight at the Congdon Shelter, we have a good water source here so it’s a good spot and it was only 14 plus miles so a nice day. Tomorrow it will be an 18 mile day, hoping the water will have dried up a bit.Had a talk with some really cool young hikers that we are always bumping in to. It got around to food and what they eat so I am going to go for a higher protein food drink supplement for breakfast and after my dinner and before my hot chocolate drink, they said it will help with my stamina on the rest of the hike.At the moment I feel great apart from the usual aches and pains, I am walking and climbing great, and am happy with my performance, a little bit more zip might help.Well have to close now, we are camped above a cascading river and it sounds great especially after all the water that fell yesterday.

Oh forgot the damn rocks, not impressed at all, but I did climb an old fire tower and the view was spectacular.We left the Congdon Shelter, “Two of my Mum and Dads best friends were called Marg and Den Congdon, brought back fond memories for me”.The Trail has dried out a bit but still some marshy ground even up high on the mountains there are still lots of board walks.It’s a very rocky trail on the ups and the downs, very rocky and steep on the descent to the VT 9 road into Bennington. Then after the road a really big climb out to Porcupine Ridge, then it was on to Little pond Mtn.On the summit of Little Pond Mtn there is an old fire tower, and with no views on this section of the trail I had to climb up to check it out. Bit wobbly but the view was spectacular, hope we come across more of these.More ups and down and I notice that most of the Forest trees are Fir’s of different species. The smells are fantastic, there are also a lot of Birch trees. I love to see the bark on these trees, it’s hard for me as a woodworker to see all these trees that are down across the trail and the trail maintainers have used chain saws to cut a section out to allow us to pass thru.The tree trunks will never be harvested as it’s illegal to remove wood from these forests, they will just slowly rot away back to dust. We see it every day, and the cut sections have no checks or cracks in them as they are slow to dry out because of the temperature, lots of Bowls and Pens up here.We arrive at our campsite, it is really rough the worse we have camped on yet, we set up our tents, I have an hour nap then it’s filter some water and cook my dinner. Now doing my Journal and into bed fully clothed it’s going to be 44 degrees in the town of Bennington so up here on the mountain top should be about 40 degrees.So it’s a chilly good night from me see you tomorrow.Anyone can walk on the flat , it’s tough to walk on the Edge, in a sleeping bag fully clothed.Only got a 564.8 miles to go before we summit Mt Katahdin","Congdon Shelter Campsite

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597763,"Crazy BritLast night was another cold one, I wore my long pants and my puffy Jacket, over my clothes so I was snug as a bug in a rug.Another muddy day in Vermont and it’s not even mud season yet. Today’s trail is rocky and muddy, throw in some big climbs and you have a day on the trail.Today we have a 15 mile day, so as usual the alarm goes of at 4:45 time to pack up the gear in the tent, then put the water on to boil. While this is going I take down my tent and pack it away, just in time to put the coffee in my cup, add boiling water, milk and sugar, hey presto great coffee.Once my bag is packed I can sit down and have a coffee and breakfast before hitting the trail.Today our biggest climb is Stratton Mountain at 3936 feet. Of course it’s really rocky and the aforementioned Mud, it’s hard going. There is a great stream where we can filter our water, ready to cook dinner tonight.On top of this mountain is a lookout tower the view is again fantastic. You can see up into New Hampshire and back into Massachusetts, it was a bit windy up on top, making the whole tower shake. Had my lunch at the base of the tower, all is good in the world.It’s only a 3 mile walk to our destination for today at the Stratton Pond Shelter. This is a caretaker cared for shelter so there is a fee of $5.00 per person  which is ok with me. This caretaker is about 25 years old and he has just the job I craved for when I was his age. He runs two campsites at either end of the lake, between the two with a Canoe.Just been sat talking to him while he was having his dinner, after his dinner he paddles out onto the lake and has gone fishing for his breakfast, I looked all forlorn to have a ride, but to no avail.So now I am finishing my journal, watching the caretaker Flyfish and watch the sun going down.So will say goodnight see you tomorrow.Anyone can walk on the flat, try sitting on a beautiful lake shore, watching the sun go down on a Vermont lake shore, nothing to with being on the edge but close.Only got 549.8 miles to go before we climb Mt Katahdin","Kid Gore Shelter

We are making really good time, we are only doing 10.7 miles today as we are going to take a Zero on Sunday as we haven’t had a full day off since Harpers Ferry so we are due.There are no views today except for Prospect Rock and it’s a vertical climb up to the Rock View, we don’t bother as we smell town food!!!! There are again some pine forests to hike thru, the smells are fantastic really fresh.We have a really big descent to the road VT 11 & 30.

What an awesome place even had lakes that were stocked with large rainbow trout, the fly casting coaches were teaching young guys casting techniques, then they could fish in the lakes.They were catching Rainbow Trout the largest I have seen at least 24 inches in length, beautiful fish I was really envious. The people in the store were really helpful, telling me all about the equipment they make here at this facility.After being there for 3 hours I made my way into the town to find a bar where I could get a beer, harder than you would think. Found one that I was comfortable in and had a couple of beers and some food.David called he was in town ready to get our restocking food.Now time for a Latte at Starbucks, then a shuttle back to the Green Mountain House Hostel.

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598186,"Entry 128Today was disaster day in many ways will explain as I write my Journal.We had a great breakfast of pancakes made by David. I had about 5 of them get us ready for the day. 6:00 am we are ready to get going there are four of us going out, Mama Shorty, Chug along her husband, David and Myself .We are doing a Slack pack today a nice 17.6 miles from Danny-Landgrove Road , back to VT 11&30 Manchester Center. We have had at least 3 weather reports, all say that there will be heavy Drizzel at about 2:00pm so we will be almost back by then so no problem.We have a 35 min ride out to the drop off point, nice to look over the beautiful Vermont Countryside as we drive by. At our destination we get our packs on and head out. Pretty nice trail, apart from the normal rocks in the trail, and some left over muddy spots.We are making good time without our full packs, as we climb up into the mountain there is some mist still hanging around, making the undergrowth wet as you are pushing thru. The trail is not groomed up on the mountain tops like it is by the roads, “this actually makes day hikers thing all the trail is nice and trimmed, far from it”.At about 8:30 it started to sprinkle with rain, no problem as under the tree canopy it hardly effects us, 10 mins later it gets harder time to out on the waterproofs. Then it started lashing rain and we are at least 5 miles from a shelter, we have to keep going, at last I cross a river and there is the log built shelter, “Thank You Lord”.I sit in the shelter and wait for David I see him coming down the Trail, like me soaked. Light weight waterproofs are good but they have there limitations. He see’s the Shelter as he crosses the bridge, a big smiles lights up his face.Although it is still just before 10:00am we eat half our lunch and some protein bars to keep warm and keep up our energy. Soon two AT Nobo hikers come in. These are two girls we are often meeting on the trail, they too start to snack. Then another guy comes in and we sit and watch the rain pelting down, it gets stronger and stronger, you can actually see the river getting swollen, and louder.After about 30 minutes we get a break, well it might be over ???? As we were getting cold David and I decide to hike out. Everything is looking good, maybe it has stopped ???? Then the Heavens opened up again. By now the trail is a river and we have to just wade thru the muddy water, this is always a problem as you cannot see the rocks and roots, it is now up over our boots and sometimes up to your calf, still we carry on as there is another shelter up by the Ski lift. Got some rough trail to get to the summit but eventually we come out on a surreal setting. Ski mountain lifts all shrouded in swirling mist, they look kind of strange with no snow around them, sad looking.We head over to the Ski Patrol hut which hikers are welcome to use out of the snow season, nice to get out of the rain, friends of ours arrive just after us and get warm. It stopped raining so we can now head down.We have to walk down part of one of the runs, again these runs look strange with no snow covering them.We eventually get down to the Carpark after watching the rivers explode with all the water coming off the mountain. It really amazes me how fast these rivers go from a small stream into a raging river of white water, logs and stones being washed down stream.We come out on to the road like drowned rats, trying to thumb a ride. After about 10-15 mins a van stops it’s a blueberry farmer and we get in he takes us to Starbucks coffee shop, for a well earned Latte.All this time David has been complaining about a burning sensation in his shorts. Turns out he has 3rd degree burns from our washing at the Hostel one of the girls did our washing , and she must have put in to much soap as David’s shorts never got properly washed out of soap. He actually had soap running down his legs in the rain, now he is in agony.We call the hostel and get a ride back, David is right in the shower and washing down. The result is he had to go to the Emergency Clinic and get treated, 3rd Degree chemical burns to his lower regions, “ ouch”.Time for bed goodnightAnyone can walk on the flat , takes a Hero to walk on the Edge with sore GooliesOnly got 521.5 Miles to go before we summit Mt Katahdin","Danny-Landgrove Road

Went into the Orvis Rod Factory for a tour of their Manufacturing Process, what a cool place. I was surprised that none of their Fly Rods are made offshore, in fact most of them are made in the Manchester Facility which is Awesome.The Tour started at 10:00am, we went thru all the process’s From Bamboo, hand made poles to Fiberglass, then on to Graphite. How they are cut and hand scraped on the Bamboo Rods, to CNC cutting of the pre-preg Carbon, rolling on the steel mandrel, cooking the Carbon, removing the Mandrel, checking for size, bending moments, then whipping the eyes on. This job is done by hand in the shop, and in fact they have 17 home workers whipping eyes at home, then the painting process and finally the cork grip shaped, then assembled with the reel grip and glued on the rod.Every rod is inspected by 4 people any slight imperfection and it is sent to the team that sorts out the imperfection, then it goes back to the team and goes thru the inspection process again, until it’s perfect. I will never complain about the Cost of a Orvis product again, Highly, Highly impressed.Orvis has a huge presence in Manchester, with the Fly Fishing Museum, Casting School Flagship Store and the Outlet Store. Obviously with all the offices and engineering guy’s, a big employer in a small town of this size.After all this excitement I had to find a bar. In Vermont there are no bars persay, they have to be a restaurant with a bar. So no problem found an Irish Bar Mulligans, with good Guinness, and food, so all was good in the World.Checked out the town again, back to the Outfitters to get a pack cover, lost mine and walk back to the Hostel, I got picked up about a half mile from the Hostel, Cool.Now it’s time to read, have Dinner and relax , Oh catch a nap first, read some more, now it’s time for bed.Goodnight catch you tomorrow.Oh Dave is doing good his burns are responding to the medication, so we will be out on the Trail on Thursday.Anyone can walk on the flat, takes a special person to hike with a fly rod, and Yes I will buy a permitStill got 521.5 miles to go before we stand on the top of Mt Katahdin","

I know I have said it before but these animals are amazing, they hate the sound of running water, so when they here the sound the dam must be leaking so off they go get more mud and twigs to block the leak.We pass a couple of shelters and go into the Government Clement Shelter for lunch, nice shelter.We now come to the Clarendon Gotge and cross a suspension bridge bit Wobbly, but safe as houses. The river has gone down a bit but it’s still impressive, we now have a rock scramble to contend with, this looks really crazy getting us ready for the Whites in NH.It’s pretty tough especially as the rocks are all wet and really slippery, it’s a tough climb, made worse as it’s the end of the day. We get to the Clarendon Shelter and lucky there is only one person there, a bonus.I am going to sleep in the shelter Dave is going for his tent.

From here it was a long long climb up to the top of Smarts Mountain, and the old Fire Wardens Cabin and Fire Tower, this was a tough climb, up some 3000 ft, well almost.Of course the Trail was really wet and muddy, in fact at one point I was leading over a particularly muddy section when I heard a shout from behind, there was Dave up to his knees in smelly, slimy mud. I never laughed, just concerned how is he going to get out of this s...t , he eventually got out then I admit I laughed a bit, well so did he.There was a huge descent from 3219 ft to 1450 ft this was over wet slippery boulders, not very cool.Once down you can measure the descent by the ascent you are about to take. We were not disappointed climbing up to the summit of Mt Cube North Peak, then as soon as you are up you are on your way down again.We are passing thru such fantastic forests, first hard woods at the lower levels, then into the fantastic smelling Pine forests, then we come out to the stunted growth trees at the higher elevations.

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599331,"Crazy BritGood news it just sprinkled a little thru the night, so my tent was not that wet to pack up. I Hate packing a wet tent knowing that you have to use it that night. We are up at 4:30 am, “David can’t have a lie in”, we have coffee and a breakfast snack, and are on the Trail at 5:30 am.It’s a great trail not a lot of mud or rocks the temperature is perfect all in all this is going to be a good day, David has gone off in front while I get some water. So I am all alone in this beautiful pine forest walking on soft pine needles, a fantastic aroma of fresh pine .At about this time I am overtaken with a vision of my Mum and Dad my Uncle Gerald And Uncle Derek, these have all passed, yet they are right there with me. I can see them years ago laughing and joking, then they fade leaving my Mum looking years younger, as I remember her when I left England for the USA. This then faded to when I went home to be with her before she passed.I was with her and my special Sister Margaret for 7 months, I cried when I saw her. The Matriarch of our family was now this older lady lying in a bed. I was mad with myself for leaving her, although I had been to the UK a couple of years before, getting old sucks.Now there she was, good looking, strong, the boss, I never cried a lot when she passed, but now the tears flowed. No one to see me, just me and Mum and the forest. I said I was sorry for all the stupid things I had done, thanked her for all the times she bailed me out we are now ok.I am not trying to be some special person just someone who is learning things about myself every day, some good, some bad, things I would like to change but can’t. I would like to think I am a good guy, never hurt anyone intentionally, and our journey so far has had positive outcomes on our day to day hiking. Be it persons we meet, Trail Angels, just things going right, I firmly believe if you do good things you will get good things back.I know this is not a lot about my hiking, but when you are alone in this vast forest, just you the trees and the wild critters you soon realize how insignificant a human being is in this world, and YES this is Colin writing this.We have planned for this to be a short day just 8.3 miles over the mountains to the Hostel at Glencliff, again it’s one of those surreal moments one minute your in a forest and one step you on a highway into town.We walk the relative short distance to the Hostel and have a couple of cokes while we work out our situation, we are told that to climb over Mt Moosilauke in a thunder storm, which is what is predicted for tomorrow, would be stupid, so we have relocated to Lincoln, where they have restaurants and bars and some good replenishing stores.So I am now sat on the Balcony of our hotel having a Jack and Coke.So it’s a goodnight from me see you tomorrow .Anyone can walk on the flat, living on the Edge with a Jack and Coke is somewhat easier.OH Forgot to say we have gone thru the 400 miles to go this morningOnly got 398.7 miles to go before we stand on the summit of Mt Katahdin","Ore Hill Campsite

We met two hikers in town they were like drowned rats. They said it was blowing like hell on top of Mt Moosilauke, raining like hell. It’s ok if you are young and brave and stupid, but for us being a bit older and hopefully wiser, we will wait out the storm until tomorrow, when we are going to go over our first Mountain in the whites.Plus our object is to enjoy the views and share it with you guys and for one of us to get hurt at this stage of the game for being stupid, would be a disaster. It’s hard enough hiking and the occasional mountain climb where one slip and your out of the game or worse, and we are carrying a lot of peoples dreams with us and we don’t want to let them down.So we have a lazy day, went shopping for resupply, got some new liners, old ones are worn out, got a pair of Marmot water proof outer gloves to save stumpy from the cold, we feel ready to take on the last 398 Miles. Knowing that this will be the hardest Mountains we have yet to climb, while we are both a bit nervous, we are ready for this last stage of the Adventure.So at 6:30 am tomorrow morning our shuttle driver will pick us up and take us to the trail head so we can climb over Mt Moosilauke, it looks clear up there now hope there is no low cloud tomorrow .Having a Jack and Coke and heading off to bed.GoodnightAnyone can walk on the flat, nervous waiting to climb our first Mountain in the Whites but hey that is what living on the Edge is all about.Still only got 398.7 miles to go before we summit Mt Katahdin","

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599437,"Crazy BritWell today was our first mountain in the Whites Mt Moosilauke, to tell you the truth I was a bit nervous about this climb, a lot of people have said it’s so tough of a climb, it puts you on edge.Well our shuttle driver arrived, she is an expert on this area, and is the Manager of the Notch Hostel. She gave us the inside scoop, and told us that we were doing the right thing in Slackpacking this section, as coming down the North side after yesterday’s rain, will be a bit slippery and potentially dangerous.So we got dropped off and walk up the Trail to be met with big shouts from our fellow hikers Tang and Suspenders together with his dog Murdoch. They give us some stick about Slackpacking again, but admit it was pretty scary coming down from the summit yesterday in the rain, remember these guys are in there Twenties.So we set off with just a slight incline, then of course it gets steeper and steeper, now from the bottom to the summit it is a 3.9 mile climb, and there are no switch backs just right up and over, the rocks are wet and slippery, it is really rock climbing not hiking.But we are rewarded with the sight of a waterfall for a long way up the trail, there are blocks of wood bolted into the rock face. Together with a rope on the side, one slip here and it’s all over, we stop pretty often no point in getting exhausted as this is the first of many over 4000 ft Mountains we will have to climb.We are doing great, we meet a few hikers coming down, they reinforce our decision to go up here instead of down, we are told it will flatten out in a short while, heard that one before Well it does get better and I pop out above the tree line, only to duck back in to put on a shirt and my windbreaker, it’s windy and cold out there.The summit is disappointingly covered in low cloud, visibility is down to about 50 ft, we get our photos taken and then sit behind one of the walls of the old shelter to have our lunch.Soon it’s time to go down, this sounds easy but it is a really tough descent over wet slippery boulders. Not as bad as the climb up up, but no easy descent. Seemed to take ages to get to the road at Glencliff. We walk up to the Hostel get a coke and look for a ride into Lincoln , no one available so we stand outside and thumb a lift , even as tough as we look we get a ride in 10 mins , they take us half way , then we hitch again and again we get a ride , people up here they are use to hikers. We get dropped in town, get a Macdonalds milkshake, pick up some supplies, then it’s back to the lodge for a nap. On the way up thru town I am met by a guy who is following me on Trail Journals, real cool guy offered us a room and a ride out tomorrow bug we are sorted. He gave me a short ride to the lodge, his name is Dan Paradise and hiked the Trail in 2016 with the Trail name of Terodactyle. Thank you for following our adventure, and your sincere offer of help, we have met truly great people.Now it’s time for a beer so must close, see you tomorrow.Anyone can walk on the flat, no flat spots up here you are always on the edge.Only got 389.4 miles to go before we summit Mt Katahdin","Up over Mt Moosilauke ,From lost River Rd NH112 Kinsman Notch

So we set about climbing, we thought Wolf was bad, Kinsman is a lot worse, lots of Mud lots of big steep slabs of Granite you have to get a grip on and climb up over.We seem to be climbing forever, well we have been climbing for at least 10 miles, you can always tell when your getting close to the summit here the evergreen trees get shorter and shorter, and the smell of the trees get stronger.We reach the summit and damn there is no sign to show the summit, we have a break and head over to the North Peak. On the way over you could see the Kinsman Pond where we will be staying, it’s way down in a notch, looks like a great pond campsite.We are going to be staying in a nice log Built Shelter. It’s pretty large a 12 person, plus it’s just back from the pond, actually it’s a Lake but here it’s called a Pond, it’s about a mile in length, there is a resident Moose but he hasn’t shown himself yet.We register and pay the $10.00 to sleep in the shelter, this will work for us all thro the Whites also we can get 50% of food from the Huts run by the AMC a great deal.Time to make dinner and have a Hot Chocolate Drink. Water is taken from the Pond, it’s a bit Brown but when filtered it tastes good.Another great day of Mountain Climbing now it’s time for Bed.Goodnight see you tomorrow.Anyone can walk on the flat , much better to Walk on the edge and have more FunOnly got 377.9 miles to go before we summit Mt Katahdin","Lost River road Kinsman Notch

This was a nice enjoyable trail no big climbs as such, mostly down hill crossing a couple of rivers and streams, there were some scary long smooth granite sections where you were hoping you had some grip on your shoes.Incidentally I have got another new pair of shoes especially for the Whites if you have bad grip here you are toast and it’s a long way down.

Then it turned up in Massachusetts, the post office there said they were sending it back to North Carolina, Davids home. Their excuse was that liquid from the parcel had leaked out, tho there was only clothes and sleeping bags in the box, valued at just over a $1000.David got a call from Barbara saying she had received something from the post office “JUST THE SHIPPING LABEL"" said the box was lost somewhere. It so happens the post guy in Franklin filled out the address form and double sealed the box.We have no comeback on them the guy just shrugged his shoulders, said not his fault every thing was done on his advice, what a crock of crap.Good job David had spare stuff, all we need now is a good weather window and it looks good for next few weeks, so we have a ride out of here in the morning at 7:00 am great!I have got my pack packed this is the third time trying to get the weight down, now it is what it is, food for 4 days as we want to catch up on some time lost with out coming into town for supply.

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600185,"Crazy BritWe saw our best views today on our whole 5 Month Adventure. This was why we stayed at the hostel especially so we would have good views today.Our day started at 5:00am at the Hostel. We had coffee and apple cake then pasta and egg dish made by Blue, very delicious. As we were eating our breakfast a lady called Ginger came in for breakfast and she said that she was leaving and going by where we had to go and she was leaving at 6:00 am, this an hour before our shuttle was due to take us out.We asked her if she could give us a ride, she said of course, so we rushed around to get ready. Off we go after waiting around for a clear day we are ready to hike or climb the Franconia Ridge.We get dropped of at the carpark and walk the mile up to the Trailhead, the climb starts, this is a tough climb up to Little Haystack Mountain. We come out of the forest, we are now above the tree line the view is spectacular, from our position we are looking up at Mt Lincoln, which at times is covered with swirling clouds.We are at 4800 ft and Lincoln is at 5089 ft, I take lots of photos and do a FaceTime live from here. Don’t know if there will be service up on top, so we start to climbing again, it’s a tough climb especially as the wind is pretty strong, I have to put on a long sleeve shirt and a windbreaker to keep warm.We are on an open ridge with big drops on either side and the path is pretty narrow, as we get to the summit of Lincoln the clouds are blown away and we have a clear view of the whole mountain chain way up past Mt Washington. Of course the summit of Washington is covered in cloud, can only hope it clears when we get there in a couple of days.The ridge now runs over to Mt Lafayette this is at 5254 ft again it’s in cloud but as we get there it lifts and once again we have perfect views. I might add that crossing over these ridges and at first descending then climbing these Mountains is really hard work .From this vantage point you can look down on the Ski slopes of Cannon Mountain, the AMC hut named Greenleaf on its Greenleaf trail. Now we have a big descent to our shelter at Garfield Ridge, this is a really tough one, then of course we have to climb once again to the actual shelter, this is a tough day, but now I have had dinner a cup of hot chocolate, I am sat on my sleeping pad in a sleeping bag, nice and cozy and ready for bed.Today has been one of the highlights of the trip being above treeline with these magnificent views is mind numbing, worth all the pain and agony getting to this point. It's hard for me to put into writing, the views I have seen today, up on the mountain tops today, I hope that the FaceTime live video came out ok, so I could share this with you all.I will remember these views forever.

Once down we had a big climb up to South Twin Mountain, the views here are spectacular seems you can see forever.Then we go down again same thing as before, once down it’s up we go again. This time we are climbing Mt Guyot, again super views from a summit above tree line, we are heading to Zealand Falls hut  where we can get a bowl of soup and some bread because we are Thru Hikers.We now have a nice walk out to the Ethan pond campsite. Here we have to pitch our tents on wooden tent pads, we try to get all three tents on one pad, but only two would fit, so David is staying in the Shelter and Myself and Blue are tenting on the pads.

What a difference a day makes today we woke to light rain, making packing up my tent a real pain, the outer fly was soaking wet, the inner tent just little damp. The pain is we will need to set up our tents tonight or get some work for stay or pay $145.00 for a bunk in a 10 bunk room this is with the AMC.We elect to camp so we are on a double tent pad, actually my tent is in pretty good shape so all is good, we are all set up so we go up to the Hut where its nice and dry.Todays hike was tough first we had to say goodbye to Blue, he had been with us for 4 days, going to miss him he is, great guy. On the way down to the highway US 302, we come apon some Trail Angels, they make us Bacon and Egg sandwich’s with a Mimosa, well it is Sunday morning, they had all the food a hiker needs, fruit, cakes, cokes, beer, all sorts of soft drinks.I had 2 sandwiches some fruit and slice of cake, Mimosa and a beer, life is good. After this we walk down to the road for Blue to hitch a ride back to his car at the Notch Hostel. We find out later that a hikers Dad who was bringing up a new pair of boots for his son took him all the way back to the Hostel, Awesome.We are now busy climbing Mt Webster, these are some tough climbs with rock scrambles at the tops, also there are almost vertical flat Granite climbs made harder by the wet laden mist we are climbing thru, obviously there are no views from Webster cliffs which is a great shame.From Webster we have a really Slippery descent, with mud and very slippery Granite, then no sooner we are down with just a little plank walk thru a deep gooey peat bog we are going up again to Mt Jackson, you got it, it’s very muddy and slippery, it’s a tough day, good job we are only doing 9.3 miles in these conditions.The next campsite would be another 5.5 Miles and a day like this is a pain in the ass, we now have about 2 miles to go to the Mizpah Spring Hut and the Nauman campsite, we go into the Hut and have Coffee and some bread and soup, followed down with chocolate Brownies. These huts are huge with accommodation for about sixty guests and tonight they are full.After we set up our tents, we go back over to the hut for coffee and we also snag some pulled pork, there are a lot of young kids over there shouting and jumping around. After we have had enough of the noise we head back to the tents, being out in the wilderness for a time it’s a bit hard to take all the noise.Time for a nap before I complete my Journal, then it’s bed time, so I will say Goodnight.We are told the weather will be the same as today wet and misty for our summit of Mt Washington which will be a shame but we have to get the miles down so we will carry on over this Iconic Mountain with no chance of views what a shame, still on we go.Anyone can walk on the flat , living on the Edge, in the clouds wet and damp is Awesome very different from the trail so Far.Only have 339.0 miles to go before we stand on the summit of Mt Katahdin","Eathan Pond Shelter

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600358,"Crazy BritToday was all about Mt Washington, our climb out from the campsite was pretty tough it had been raining all night so all the rocks were very slippery. The first mountain we came to was Mt Pierce (Mt Clinton), from here we went over Mt Eisenhower from here we saw the sun rising up over Mt Washington, one of the best sights I have seen on the trail so far.These White Mountains are really tough, big ups and even worse big Slippery downs, our next mountain is Mt Franklin this is a 5004 ft climb there is a loop around Mt Monroe so we don’t climb up and over this one. The trail brings us to the Lake of the Cloud Hut. We get coffee and some baked goods there, by this time we could see that the clouds were going to cover the summit of Mt Washington, such a disappointment. The actual climb to the summit of Washington wasn’t really hard at all and we were walking into the restaurant just after 8:30 which was great going.One of the Cog Railway trains had just arrived so before they hogged the sign we had our photos taken, then we went to the restaurant and got some food and coffee, hoping that the cloud would lift. It was still really thick when we left, we had to go down the mountain a bit then cross over the railway.Just as we went over the rails and started to hike away the two trains blew their whistles and started down so I ran back and took some photos. The trains look a bit strange as they are up in the front to counter the angle of the slope, one train is Steam and the other is Diesel, cool looking train and carriage set up.These trails are full of stones much worse than Massachusetts, land of rocks. This terrain is like a huge rock field and of course the AT goes right thru it. We have to go around Mt Clay thank goodness, then around Mt Jefferson, over Edmunds Col and down over Adams Mountain to the Madison Spring Hut. We are staying here tonight as most of our gear is wet and it’s going to be raining again tonight, and in fact all day tomorrow.We have a great dinner with very interesting guests at our table. Hope for a good nights sleep with no snorers, I have a pair of ear plugs just in case.Today was a hard day of hiking and scrambling over rocks, with the bonus of going over Mt Washington, pity no view, but we are told it rarely is clear we have the sunrise photo’s.I am now in a top bunk in a three trot bunk setup it’s a long way down.So will say goodnight see you all tomorrow.Anyone can walk on the flat, there are no flat places up here in the White Mountain Range just big rocks , they keep you on the Edge.Only got 327.2 miles to go before we summit Mt Katahdin","Neuman Campsite

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600646,"Crazy BritLast night we had to splurge out and stay at the Madison Spring Hut. All our gear is wet, save our sleeping bags, we are knackered, there are no campsites so we would have to stealth camp which on this terrain is almost impossible.We had a good dinner with good company, so things are good. I tried to dry my tent but it was blowing like hell so it should be ok but there was so much moisture in the air there was no chance, so back in the bag it goes, ready for a sunny day????We had a good breakfast and left Madison Hut about 8:00am very late start for us.Today is all about Mt MADISON, this we had been warned is very dangerous to do in the rain or Thunder and Lightning, we only have one rain so we leave. There are another 6 NOBO hikers there and we leave at different times not by planning just by luck.You do not want to many people on the exposed ridges as that tends to push the person in front, which is so dangerous. I have “ Mud” one of our group of hikers, he is about 100 yards in front of me, after about 15 mins climbing up Madison he is out of view, the low cloud and rain has made him disappear.There are very few white blazes up here in New Hampshire, as there are so many Trails so for the AT they have piles of stones called Cairns, these are about 50 ft apart and most of them are about 6ft Tall.Like I say about “Mud” he disappeared, then as we climbed more up this rock pile the Cairns started to disappear into the rain and cloud, so you are left going from Cairn to Cairn. Sometimes the visability is so bad you are just relying on the marks on the rocks to see ahead. All the time it’s raining horizontally and with a 40 mile an hour wind it is hard to keep in contact with your partner, I would never attempt this section on my own in these conditions.Dave is nursing an old injury to his knee, aggravated by a couple of falls, which we both have had, but we are still not being caught by guys behind, this is the hardest I have ever worked to keep on the trail, and still climb over the rocks, It’s Actually Stupid when you tell people.But at the same time it’s so exhilarating to be here and you are solely relying on yourself, there is no one to help you because they are working on their own situation. The wind is trying to pluck you off the Mountain, every step you make over these slippery rocks has to be so calculated, your poles are you best friends for testing loose rocks to supporting your whole weight, I had made sure my poles were very tight more than normal.Even with the poles some times you were hand over hand over the larger rocks, good job I had a glove for my stumpy finger as it was really cold and it hurts every day. But when it gets cold it is really painful, and in these conditions and conditions to come it’s best to keep it warm in a glove.After at least five false summits, we are eventually coming to a tree line of small scrub pines, at this time we have bunched up a bit so we get into the pines and get some shelter and have a snack and a drink. We both have scrapes and cuts from the rocks and sure to have some nice bruises tomorrow.We are heading to Pinkham Notch, bloody hell its still 5 miles away, and we have been going hard for 3 hours to cover only 2 1/2 miles TOUGH!!!!Now we are into a slippery mud situation, lots of flat Granite rocks with moss on them a real nightmare. YES it’s still raining so we are now getting rain dropping vertically together with drops from the trees, plus the vegetation you are brushing against, all in all it’s Hell!Of course we have to ford streams now swollen with the rain, all in all it’s a tough day.Then as we are approaching our destination there is a sign on the trail showing a fast route to Mt Washington 4.3 miles WHAT!!! We had just done about 30 no justice but it is the Appalachian Trail??We come out of the Forest at Pinkham Notch to be met by my Old Friend Tim Otterbach. We are staying with him today and a Zero day tomorrow to get replenished and dry all our gear.We are whisked away to a bar which has great Burgers and Beer, thanks Tim.Another great day on the Trail, just glad this section is over with I will remember this for a long time.Zero day tomorrow so will let you know what happens until then Goodnight.Anyone can walk on the flat, Didn’t know living on the Edge going over Mt Madison in a Rain Storm withAlmost Zero Visability could be so Crazy and ExhilaratingOnly now got 319.4 miles before we have another Exhilarating climb to summit Mt Katahdin the big one !!!!!","Madison Spring Hut

Of course we are made welcome and after a great late lunch we are settled down, checking out Tim’s Toys in his yard.His neighbor drives by and tells us to get in the truck we are going for a drive to get an ice cream, really cool!People Charlie hiked the Trail in 2004 so we had a lot in common, his Wife Jeneen said she would do our washing, great day.In the morning we are headed out to breakfast, Tim said best place was at the local Golf club, Boy was he right great food and really great coffee.After breakfast we went shopping then came back, helped with the washing, talked, relaxed and went fishing.Getting ready to tackle the Wildcats and Carter Mountain Range Tomorrow.Anyone can walk on the flat , tough walking on the edge lots of fun and exhilarating.Still got 319.4 miles to go before we summit Mt Katahdin","

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600648,"Crazy BriWe leave Tim’s house and head to the Trailhead at Pinkham Notch, stopping on the way to get Coffee at Macdonalds and a breakfast sandwich. After this we head out to the Trailhead at Pinkham Notch, this is a very busy place lots of cars in the carpark, all these cars means lots of people out hiking the trails.We cross over the Highway with Tim taking photos of us, he would love to hike with us but after his kidney stones the doc said no strain on his body, so we leave Tim thanking him profusely for his kindness in putting us up as his house guests.We are surprised that the trail looks like it’s skirting the mountain, and we check our Guthook App on our phones to make sure, no we are on the trail, then it starts going up, now we know we are on the trail, it’s a rough rock strewn trail, going straight up the mountain no switch backs here.We are told this is one of the hardest Trails up and over the Wildcat Mountain Range, this is a tough trail. We do have some great views on the way, this gives us a chance to take a 5 min break, any more and it’s a problem to get the legs going again.There are 4 peaks in this range E.D and C. And A, don’t ask what happened to B  I am only taking it from the guide book.Each of the above peaks are tough, lots of Hand over Hand climbing and the descents are a lot worse, slippery rock with mud holes in between. We hear on the Hiker Grape Vine that a NOBO hiker fell yesterday afternoon and it took 20 people to stretcher him of the mountain, he had slipped on one of the sloping prices of Granite and broke his leg. He was stretchered off because it costs roughly $25.00 an hour to get the National Guard up to the Mountain with one of their Black Hawk Helicopters, an Expensive game.From where we are having our lunch , sat on a rock outcrop on Wildcat Peak A., we can see the collection of Huts way down in the Notch below, it looks pretty cool sat above two Alpine lakes. After lunch we start down, this is a really tough trail, very, very steep Slippery Rocks and plenty of mud holes to help with the difficult terrain.We make it down ok and come out onto a beautiful Alpine lake. These lakes are pristine very clear cold water, this one had Lily’s growing all around the edge of it, as we went up the trail we came to another equally as beautiful lake, today we are being spoiled.The Hut is just up the trail and we enter and book in. This is the Last AMC Hut Northbound or the First Hut Southbound really homely place. Today is the first day of their Fall season so the Hut today is only managed by Two people.For two people they do a great dinner, fresh baked bread, soup, salad and an Entree followed by dessert and lots of Coffee. After dinner we go on a Nature walk run by one of the staff, really interesting stuff. Now it’s time to settle down, chill out and do today’s journal, once done I will say Goodnight see you all tomorrow with hopefully another FaceTime from on top of the Dome on Carter Mountain.Anyone can walk on the flat, up here in the mountains it’s hard to find a flat place so you are always on the Edge , it’s pretty Cool and Exhilarating, you should Try it.Only got 313.5 miles to go before we summit the big boy Mt Katahdin.","Pinkham Notch

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600695,"Crazy BritHad a great breakfast at the Carter Notch Hut. This Hut is in the shadow of the Carter Dome and the more you look at it the more scary it looks, you can see parts of the Rock strewn trail from the comfort of the Hut, it sure looks daunting.Well we are all packed up time to say goodbye to the AMC Hut system they have been great with Coffee and baked goods, left over soup and bread, and the two we stayed at, full dinner and breakfast endless coffee and comfortable bunk beds, this one at Carters Notch was the best.There were another 4 thru hikers staying there last night and as we leave the other day hikers offer there Congratulations and best wishes for the next 300 miles, makes you feel good.We start down the trail past the twin lakes, then start up what seems like an endless climb. Boy this is steep right of the bat, my Arthritis in my toes had better warm up as they are hurting like hell, and the Ibuprofen hasn’t kicked in yet. Stumpy my finger-stump has to have a glove for the chilly morning apart from the normal aches and pains, carrying a full pack, all is going good.We have to climb like this for a couple of miles, a couple of false summits, we are lucky that most of the rocks and the almost vertical slabs of granite are dry. This makes all the difference to the comfort level of climbing, it still leaves the big drops, but it is much safer to navigate when dry, we still have the mud pools in the low spots but even these are drying out.But we have a huge shadow over us, the weather, our report this morning was calling for rain early afternoon with Thunder and Lightning on Higher elevations “Guess where we are”.So we have decided to call it a day at the Imp Shelter, on North Carter Mountain, this means that we have done all the Carter Range, and will only have a relatively short hike into Gorham Tomorrow Morning, with Tain but no thunder and lightning.There are some great views today none better than away in the distance the Majesty of Mt Washington, clear as a bell with no cloud cover surrounded by the whole Range standing clear and proud. We are making great time, but being very cautious, remembering what happened to one of the NOBO hikers the day before yesterday, one slip here and you are out of the game, foot and trekking pole placement is very important, “ Yes Janice I am being extra careful”.The last mile to a shelter always feels like a long, long time at last we see a sign telling us that we are within a half mile of the shelter, still a long way over sloping granite slabs. At last the sign showing the way to the shelter , OH NO!!!! Another 600 yds of trail, we would normally not go to a shelter so far off trail but we are sleeping here out of the storm, so it’s ok, still a long way.We book in with the Caretaker pay our $5.00 it’s half price with our pass and go to the shelter, it’s an older style shelter has two levels and at the moment we are the only occupants, hope it stays that way????We have had dinner and I am now sat on a log Throne overlooking the Mountains and I can feel the rain on the way, the wind has picked up and the temperature has fallen significantly so I have on my nice warm Puffy jacket, “Thank you Janice”. I am completing my Journal, it’s amazing how much time this takes, still it hopefully keeps you up to date with David and my Adventure on this Awesome trip it’s been a Blast,With that I will say Goodnight to you all thanks for reading and commenting on this my Journal,Goodnight.Anyone can walk on the flat, there ain’t no flat up here on this Mountain top , so we are walking on the Edge all day , OH we are also Sleeping on the Edge makes it better!!!!!!Only got 306.3 miles to go , Mt Katahdin is getting closer with every footstep.","

Sounds easy just a little 8 mile hike, well we left the Imp Campsite and Shelter, we elected to sleep in the shelter because of the storm, we didnt want to get our gear wet, no rain in the evening but when we got up at the ungodly hour of 4:30am it had started to rain.So we packed our gear made coffee, the dawn light was late today the sky was so overcast with the storm about to roll in that we started out at our usual time of 5:30 and had to use our headlights for at least a half an hour. Stupid Yes, but we need to get off this mountain before it gets real bad.We started up the trail first David led then I took over, it was a scramble up over boulders. At first it was so hot, we took off our wet gear. It was only a slight damp drizzle because of the low cloud, then it started to rain hard then harder, we got on our rain gear, by then we were soaked thru.The good thing was under our rain gear with our sweating climbing it was like wearing a wet suit, nice and warm. That is until we stopped for a drink or something to eat, then it got real cold, real fast.We went over at least 6-7 false summits each time getting blasted by Horizontal rain, beating on you, trying to make you trip on the Slippery granite, as the rain got harder so the trail got worse, with water and mud filling all the voids in the rocks where normally there would be flat places to place your feet.Its at times like this that you forget about keeping your feet dry. The main thing is feet and trekking pole placement, this is paramount to your safety, water may be pouring down the trail, but your safety comes first.Although the conditions are bad we are making good time and are on the last summit ready for our descent, when a young guy comes bouncing up the trail. He is doing the Continental trail from Quebec to Key West, Oh My!!!!! Big Balls, he has a single pole a very small pack and goes by wishing us luck. ????We start the descent its like always, Slippery Muddy and outright Bloody dangerous.Still we make it down ok in fact the last 2 miles are by The White Mountain standards very smooth, we get to the Main Highway and walk up to the Hostel. This is a great place and is used as a model for all the Best Hostels.We check in, boots and poles are left outside, packs are brought in and hung on hooks. You can then pick loaner clothes, have a shower, and only until you are clean are you allowed into the rest of the house, as it should be.We are issued our bunks, have Coffee and left over pancakes. Now we are waiting for my Good Friend Bob Revo From the UK Sail loft where I used to work, to come for a visit. I call Bob he is a hour away so we get a bit organized and await his arrival.I cannot believe he is driving across Maine to visit with us here, I walk out the door and there he is with his son Kyle, last time I saw Kyle he was a young boy, now he is a grown young good looking man.Big hugs, still find it hard to think that they have driven for over 2 hours to come here to visit with us, OH!!!!! Good boy Bob he has brought some beer in a cooler. We have a beer while we chat, Bob explains that they only have a couple of hours as his Dad is on his own over in their house in Maine.What can they do to help us, Well a trip to Walmart is on the cards so we can replenish our food stock, but first its time to eat. We find a home style restaurant and in we go, Burgers and Beer, and Bob picks up the tab, thanks Bob my turn next time.On to Walmart do our shopping and then back to our Hostel, time for photos and Bob and Kyle drive back over to the coast in Maine where there summer home is, its times like these that you value your friends, thanks Bob and you Kyle.Time now at the Hostel to Chill out watch a movie, get my Journal done, have a beer and say goodnight to you all.Anyone can walk on the flat, but its so cool to walk on the Edge up to your ankles in mud and water, at least I think it is!!!!!?????Gone thru the 300 miles to go today, should have mentioned it before but I forgot still we now have only 298.3 miles to go before we stand on the top of Mt Katahdin.","Imp Campsite into US 2

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600942,"Crazy BritGood Hike today we are accompanied now by our Good Friend “Mad Paddy” His Wife “Tea Pot” drove him up from Cape Cod to hike with us for a Hundred or so miles, he has been missing the Trail.We met them at the Rattle River Hostel which is right on the trail. We had stayed there last night, great place run very well, in fact this hostel has become the Model that most of the better run Hostels are copying. Before you enter the main house you have to leave your shoes outside, you have a shower using their loner clothes, the pack stays in the outer room which has got fans and dehumidifier in it to help remove any unwanted smells, your washing is done, then you are free to enter the house proper.Nice place very clean, nice kitchen you can use, coffee going all the time, plus a pancake breakfast, and a bonus comfortable bunks with clean sheets and pillow cases, all for $35.00 per night.Anyway I digress from the hiking, Paddy is testing his knee, feeling good so off we go it’s a nice gentle road walk at first past a Hydroelectric dam, very interesting, big flow of water being discharged back into the river.The Trail then takes a turn to start our climb up the mountain, we are going up Cascade Mountain, the climb is quite good, not to tough for Paddy so we climb up to a view, and take a break for a snack and drink of water, we are all going good.The trail is good so far Not to much mud or running water, it is drying out fast from yesterday’s rain , there are some good views today from on top of big flat Granite ledges we have lunch. The views are as usual spectacular, there are a few large Beaver ponds that we pass. On a campsite on the first pond David finds a fishing pole just what I need, it’s a two piece which makes it awkward to carry in my backpack, as it sticks out a bit and catches the overhead branches, so I tape it to a trekking pole, this is a pain so at the next pond I leave it against a tree for someone else to use.We are heading to Gentian Pond Campsite, a nice place with wooden tent platforms. David picks a single and Paddy and I have a double with plenty of room for our tents. Paddy has got a stinger Wall tent the very one that I wanted from Big Agnes back when I started the hike nice tent lots of volume above your head.We are all set up just had dinner and Hot Chocolate, I am sat doing this journal as usual, it takes a lot of work to get this done every night, then sending it to Stacy so she can upload it to the website, hope you all are enjoying it.For me now it’s time for Bed so I will say Goodnight to you all see you Tomorrow.Anyone can walk on the flat, if you can find a flat place up here it would be a bonus, you can then live on the Edge, it makes the day so much better.Only got 286.5 miles to go before we stand on the top of the big boy Mt Katahdin."," US 2 Gorham NH

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601054,"Crazy BritWhat a hard day 12.3 miles took us 13 hours today.Life started out good hiking out of Gentian Pond Campsite, it started to go down hill pretty fast, we had to climb Mt Success, which is hard, but it’s a great feeling as you know you are getting to the Maine Border.As we were getting closer a few SOBO hikers were Congratulating us on almost getting into Maine. We came up over a short rise and there was Guy Taking the sign down, “What”, it’s ok, he is just changing out the sign. So we are the last ones to use the old signs and the first to use the new ones.We have our photos taken, with old and new, and on we go, after Mt Success is My Carlo another hard mountain. The climbs are tough but the descents are often a lot harder, going over, damp rocks that would just love to trip you up. Next is Goose Eye Mountain North Peak this is really tough, as usual in Maine.We know that the Mahoosuc Notch is coming up this is a really, Really, REALLY, tough Notch you have to pack up your Trekking poles as they will only get in your way. We came up to the Notch, “Oh My” this is tough Huge Rocks all piled up, big drops into really dark holes where a person could fall and disappear for ever.This is a tough way to Hike. I love it reminds me of my days on Dartmoor, jumping from boulder to boulder, great times!!!!It takes us 1-1/2 hours to go one mile, we get to a campsite at the end of the Notch and set up our tents. Time to get our dinner, we were so tired it was hard to eat dinner, but we have to eat, to be able to hike tomorrow.I n actual fact I had a great dinner, Chicken Teriyaki, noodles and rice, an apple pie and a dark Chocolate Bar, washed down with a Hot Chocolate drink, life is Good.I just have to tell you that we were warned about the White Mountains and the first 100 miles in Maine they are tough, big up and really nasty Descents, big rocks Slippery and muddy, holes, this State is a CHALLENGE all what we have been told it was.Anyone can walk on the flat, but here it’s tough to walk anywhere, but the edge is really Cool.Only got 274.2 miles to go before we stand on the dummy of Mt Katahdin","Gentian Pond Campsite

Pack up our gear, have breakfast, and we are ready to take on the Mahoosuc Arm. This is supposed to be the hardest climb on the whole AT, after about 30 Mins, I believe it, it is endless. Rock face after rock face, it is really tough and rough.After we get to the summit, 1-1/2 hours, I do my daily live FaceTime, and have a snack and a drink of water. Next on our list of Mountains to conquer is the Spec Mountain , “again this is tough"".In the Notch there is a beautiful Lake, this is Spec Lake. I am told this is what Maine is like Lakes and Mountains. Going to get a fishing pole in the next couple of days. It is drop dead gorgeous up here unbelievable views and vistas.

We left the pine Ellis Hostel in Andover Me  to drive to the Grafton Notch ME 26 at 5:00 am it was a 30 min drive to our trail head, as soon as we got there it started to rain, not a good sign as we have to go over Baldpate Mountain.This is a pretty tough climb and once on top there is a huge great Bald of rock. The wind was blowing at least 40mph and the rain was coming at us horizontally. The wind at times came in huge gusts and it was hard to stand on the Granite Rock and make progress forward.As you were pushing forward you were looking out for the White Blazes and the Stone Cairns, at times these were hard to distinguish between the scrub pines. I am glad there were three of us to go over this Bald, as doing it on your own would be a bit dangerous, big drops on either side if you went over it would be hard to find your body.Eventually we start going down hill this is now harder because of all the rain, making things very slippery, we all have slipped a few times, but have kept the slides under control. Soon after at least 5 hours we come to the Baldpate lean - to, where we will have our lunch.There were two girls in there that we knew plus a guy who just would not stop talking, “Yes Even Worse Than Me"". We stayed had our lunch and headed out into the rain, that guy Sucks. We have a small up then we can call the Hostel for a pick up, it’s about 2 hours from here 4 miles all down hill so we are told ?????The trail is actually pretty good and all down hill so we are happy, it’s still raining as we make the call for the pickup.It’s a great walk nice and easy but it’s still raining. We come to a river that we have to cross the stepping stones are all covered, as the flood water from the rain has made the river to rise dramatically, I just wade thru at least the flood water will wash of the Mud.It’s not far to the exit point and the van is waiting there for us, Perfect!!!!We all load into the van and are driven at what I would describe as high speed to the Hostel, first thing get a beer, Great!!!We are the first hikers back soaking wet but victorious we got over Baldpate Mountain.Time to eat in the Red Hen have a beer and chill out, it was pointed out that all the hikers on the Porch are of a Mature age, we are all lucky to be here.Well got to go eat again and maybe have another beer and go to bed.Goodnight to you all.Anyone can walk on the flat, but up here walking on the Edge soaking wet is so Exhilarating and fun.","Grafton Notch

We get dropped of by David who works at the Hostel, the first thing you find out is that as you enter the forest there is a river you have to Ford, the others wade thro with their shoes on. Me I have bad Arthritis in my big toes, so having my feet wet at the start of the day would be very painful.So I take of my shoes and socks and wade over, then dry my feet and I am ready to go, big climb out at first up and over Moody Mountain. Next on our hike is Wyman mountain, there is a lean-to Shelter, where we are having a break.Wyman is our last mountain today after this we are told it is all downhill to our finish point. It’s a great trail and as we are heading South we are meeting lots of people coming up North. Some of these people we haven’t seen for months, there is great excitement in their voices about how close we are to our destination, and the finish to our adventure.We are only doing relatively short distances as there is problems with getting campsites or shuttle rides out, next week will be better and we can start racking up the miles. It’s not long before we pop out of the Forest on to the road and there is our shuttle driver all ready for us. David is already in the Van as he went on ahead, it’s a short drive back to the Hostel, where we can shower and get a beer.Today has been the best days hiking for a couple of weeks, perfect cool weather, and a fairly good trail, apart from the Water and Mud left over from the storm yesterday, with today’s high winds I hope the trail dries out some more.I have called Altra shoes to ask about some of my tread coming of, they are sending me a new pair to the post office in Caratunk, a great company that stands by their product, thank you guy’s now I have no worries about my foot ware.Well it’s time to go to the local restaurant for an all you can eat Mexican dinner tonight sounds good to me.So will say Goodnight see you all tomorrow.Anyone can walk on the flat but it’s so cool walking on the Edge in these Beautiful Mountains.Only got. 246.8 miles to go before we are standing on the top of Mt Katahdin.","south arm road

This was a tough climb, good job it was first thing in the morning when we have that extra bit of energy, we need it because the next Mountain is Bemis Mountain, on the descent from the summit I was in the lead. When I stood on a Bog plank which immediately turned and I ended up with one foot in the muddy bog, sat on the plank with my other foot just up to the ankle.This is really not cool as I have been trying to keep my feet dry, as it keeps my Arthritis in my big toes at bay, now they are cold and wet, plus I have hurt my arm when I fell it wrapped around a tree the wrong way, one of the things we have to bare, take another pill it works wonders.We have to call in at little Bemis to get our pick up from David, he has told us that the last couple of miles are really tough, so we will have to be prepared.On the way down to the river we come across a husband and wife doing Trail Magic. These people are awesome they come out 6 days a week to feed and water the AT Hikers, these are really nice people.Crossing over the river we have to start our climb up to the Highway at ME 17 Height of Land View, a great overlook of the huge Lake around Rangeley.

We have a climb up a small mountain then it’s just gentle climbs and descents, the trouble is there are still a lot of foggy parts of the trail, these are a pain as they slow you down a lot, just when you get up to speed.We still have Mad Paddy with us and he is doing great. They are making fun of me after I would not have dinner with them last night, it was a prime Rib special night, and I don’t like the sight of the fat on Prime Beef, yes I know it’s supposed to be the best bit, but the thought of a room full of people slurping on a fatty prime beef is not for me.We pass some really Great Lakes they look awesome in the early morning with small wisps of fog and a flat calm surface, but still Moose, we are making good time. Have our lunch and finish off the hike to our take out point, there are several hikers sat around some Trail Angels, but most of the goodies were gone just some snacks left.We are walking up the road when a car stops and gives us a ride to our Hostel, when we get there a guy tells us that the hostel has moved dither into town and they have a large wedding going on 164 Guests.

Still no view Oh Well!!!!!From here it was a downhill, then an uphill to Spaulding Mountain another hard climb, again no view from the summit, now it was a downhill to the Carrabassett river, our campsite is just across the river, we set up our gear MADD Paddy is already there tent up all smart and clean. He is sat by the river having a wash and washing his socks and top, I got water and washed in the river your legs get covered in mud hiking on these trails.Now it’s time to have dinner and write my Journal so will say Goodnight.OH Forgot on Spaulding Mountain there is a Bronze Plaque stating that around this area was where the last part of the Appalachian Trail was finished, also it’s 200 miles to the Summit of Mt Katahdin, and we are now under the 200 mile Barrier.Anyone can walk on the flat , but it is special to walk on the Edge you get more out of life.Only got 196.6 miles to go before we both stand on top of Mt Katahdin","Poplar Ridge Lean

James our driver is a Marine Corps Veteran, he will be leaving the hostel in a month after season ends he then travels around the country helping out Marines in need, all free work, some people say he is hard to get on with, we got on fine with him.He told us that this work he is doing helps him out, without it he said he would be one of the statistics of Ex military personnel blowing their brains out. He is a cool guy even more so now we know his work, we get to the Trailhead and it’s time to hit the Trail.Well for a change today we are going to have a relatively flat trail just three small climbs, but there is always a price to pay. Wet slippery rocks and equally wet slippery tree roots, Oh and gooey Black Mud. Our put in was at Flagstaff Rd and we are heading to the Pierce pond Lean to campsite some 16.3 miles away. This will set us up for our ferry across the Kennebec river.We are making great time on this Terrain, just like being down South where you can do good miles before lunch. I am having a bit of a problem with a pain in the back which is causing me to take some more pills, just another pain we have to bare, good job this Trail is nearly over, our bodies are beginning to tell us to slow down and take it easy. This is just not David and Myself, everybody is feeling the aches and pains.We arrive at the Pierce Pond, actually it’s a 9 mile long lake, I set up my tent and David is going to sleep in the shelter. I need a good nights sleep, and it’s tough in a shelter for me, as there are snorers and squeaky air mattresses, me I like my tent.Some people in the shelter have just come back from booking a breakfast at Harrison’s fish camp, David walks over and books us in for the 7:00 am feast, I have to walk over and check the place out, such a cool place full of fishing and hunting parifinalea. Can’t wait for my breakfast, well had my dinner, Teriyaki rice and pasta, pretty good, washed down with Hot Chocolate and some pieces of Lindt Dark chocolate with sea salt , “Yes Janice I do eat”. So I'm camped with in about 20ft from the lake waiting for the Lions to start calling, I love their calls, will lay in my sleeping bag, where it’s warm, so Goodnight see you all tomorrow.Anyone can walk on the flat , but out here in the Wilderness it’s really living on the Edge I love it.Only got 155.2 miles to go before we are standing on top of the Big One MT Katahdin.","Flagstaff Rd

There are eight other hikers here all ready and hungry, plenty of coffee all ready. Breakfast is served at 7:00am, a stack of 12 pancakes each with scrambled eggs and sausages, Awesome!

We have to use a canoe to cross over this 400 yard piece of water, the problem is there are a couple of Hydro dams up river and they let the water out a odd times, so it comes rushing down, a person has already drowned here this year, he tried to wade across and got caught out.From here it’s a short walk to the town of Caratunk it’s a really small town, no store or even a gas station. There is a brew house about 5 miles away where we will have dinner tonight, we are staying at the Caratunk House B&B, good to hikers, with great pulled pork sandwich’s and milk shakes, plus a great family breakfast.So I am now sat in a rocking chair on the porch waiting for me brown to drive to the post office just up the road.Today was a good day with a Nero will be made better if I get my shoes??See you all tomorrow.Anyone can walk on the flat, but living on the Edge with a frog getting ready to climb Mt Katahdin is so much more funOnly got 151.2 miles to go before we climb that iconic Mountain Katahdin.","

This must be a real local point as there were lots of people up there and a whole lot of young kids, having a great time. One family gave me a slice of fruit cake, we got lots of praise for our journey.The trail takes us past a couple of beaver ponds, these are really cool! You can see where the beavers naw away at the trees around the pond, felling every one into the lake so they can get at the new branches and leaves, very smart creature.We are still passing Southbounders and Flip flippers. Most will finish their thru hike at Harpers Ferry a long way South, they are envious of us only having 136 Miles to go.After the descent from the mountain the trail once again levels out with just small ups and downs. We still have plenty of Roots and Rocks to contend with but all in all a great trail, we get to the shelter and there are a few campsites dotted around, I have a nice one all nice and level makes a change.I set up my tent all ready and take a 1 1/2 hour nap, what a luxury!

Alright my turn to Ford the river, of course I get almost all the way over and one foot slips in the water I try to compensate and the other foot goes in. Not a lot but enough to get my toes wet, Great. We have a good trail just a few up and downs, before we know it we are approaching our destination for the day. We come out to a carpark and make the call to Shaw’s Hostel, in a few minutes a suv is there ready to take us to the hostel.Shaw’s is the last place to stay to replenish your food and rest up before taking on the 100 mile wilderness. We have a private room two beds, we fill out the registration, take off our shoes and are asked if we want a complementary soda or Beer. Yes you guessed it we took the beer at 9:30 am, tasted great!We then walk to the down town area, most places are closed except the deli, they made the best sandwich’s ever, came back to the hostel and chilled out. Then in the evening out came all the instruments and there was lots of singing. A pair of great musicians on guitars they could play any tunes Awesome!

Another great breakfast by the staff at The Shaw’s Hiker Hostel, the whole scene is fully charged with hikers going out on the shuttles to complete this last 100 miles of Wilderness.

David is first, I am watching and can’t work out how he will not get his feet wet, sure enough he is in the river and just continues to wade across, I take off my shoes and socks, I don’t want to walk in wet shoes all day.The trail is a bit tough not for the big long climbs we are used to just short sharp ups and downs, no time to get your breath back, we will have this for at least 3 more days, Nice.Today is hot up in the high 80 degrees, not good hiking weather.We eventually come out to the pickup point and a young man is there with his truck and offers us a ride, Cold Beer in the back, I Refuse a beer I have some at the hostel, YES I Refuse a beer!!!!!!!!!!!!In no time we are at the Hostel, have a shower, time for Dinner, now pack our gear for tomorrow.

Next was Hay Mountain, hard up and down, another mountain coming up was White Cap.

People that were dying for this to end, are now saying what do I do after I finish, where do I go, it’s a strange thing.So I will now close and say Goodnight to you all.Anyone can walk on the flat, do your self a favor and get out of your comfort zone, and live on the Edge.Only got 15.1 miles to go to the summit of Mt Katahdin","Rainbow lake campsite

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602874,"CrazyBritWOW What a day. Had a great breakfast at Abol Bridge with a whole load of hikers, it’s been one hell of a journey with these guys, we are all super excited to be on this last leg of our journey. Hiking thru the forests of Main, to the Katahdin Stream Campsite, and then to go to the Ranger Station and get our Pass and yellow slip that allows us to climb Mt Katahdin.We have all our paperwork in order, plus it was an easy 10 miles to get here some great views walking alongside the ponds, the forests are fantastic, great big trees and it’s nice to see the new growth coming up from the forest floor. Of course the smells of the forest is incredible, going to miss that, have to get some pine aroma for my car.Like I said we got our paperwork done and then decided to go to our Hostel in Millinocket, we tried hitching a ride, but no cars came, Damn this is Bad!!!!Then the Ranger came up and gave us a ride to the park entrance, nice guy.We then waited and waited for a car to pass, in the end we called a shuttle service and got the 20 mile ride into town. Great place very clean, run by the Stepmother of Shaw’s a really great place on the South end of the 100 mile wilderness.So we book into the Hostel get a shower, then grab a beer and get our laundry done. Now time for dinner, just across the street, we are joined at our table by a young guy that did the summit today, he was so excited and his photos were amazing, I am so excited to be actually going to climb Mt Katahdin tomorrow.After walking all this way it’s going to be strange going back to crowds of people, cars to drive, all the mundane things that happen. We have had very little contact with the things going on, no TV, very limited internet, having to get water from a stream then filter it. No light to turn on at a flick of a switch, food cooked by boiling water, then adding to a food source. Pitching a tent and being in bed by 7:30 pm because it’s dark, what else can you do, Damn going to miss it.Well got to go have to finish my beer and hit the sack, Goodnight to you all thank you for following my journey, only got 5.5 miles to do tomorrow before the Greatest Adventure of my life is over.Goodnight and God Bless.Anyone can walk on the flat, get out there and walk on the Edge it’s exhilaratingOnly got 5.5 miles to go can you believe it","Abol Bridge

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602947,"Crazy BritOur day started as usual with Dave up at 4:30am. Today we are going to Summit Mt Katahdin, the hardest bad Ass Mountain on the Appalachian Trail. Our Good Friend Mud is next door, he’s up ready to go to Breakfast, David and Mud walk on down to the Cafe, me I take my time cannot believe that this journey is ending today.We have a great breakfast, the cafe is owned by Paul the owner of the Hostel we are staying in, great food. We are almost ready for this venture to end, back to the Hostel to wait for Paul our driver today. We have our packs ready to go with just the bare essentials packed, it’s an Arduous climb today, and we are ready, David, Mud and Myself.Weather forecast is for fog at lower levels but on Katahdin’s Summit blue sky’s, sunshine and a nominal 5-8 miles an hour wind, PERFECT!!!!!!We load up the van and head out, as we are approaching a small hill Paul reaches over and puts on a CD, it’s the Rocky theme song, he doe’s this for all Thru Hikers, as we round the next bend, we should have been able to see our Mountain, not to be today to much low level fog.We get dropped off at the Trail head, there is a strange feeling in the air, we have been dropped off at many Trail Heads on this adventure but none like this, we give each other a clenched fist shake and head out and up our last Mountain.There are some day hikers up ahead they say, hey guys stand aside Thru Hikes coming up, as we pass they clap their hands and congratulate us. This will happen whenever we come across day hikers all the way to the Summit.We pass some really cool waterfalls, photo opp, but we three have only one thing on our minds today, the Summit and that Iconic Sign. The Trail starts to get tougher, Roots and Rocks, rocks and roots, then we come out of the forest by the treeline.The views are astounding, the sky is crystal clear, our climb gets tougher, it’s now time to pack away our Treking poles. It’s hand to hand now, good job there are some steel hand holds to assist us. David is behind so we wait for him. He has been thinking of his brother’s who both sadly died at an early age, this is a very tough mountain it makes you think about your family and friends, both present and past, we have both lost friends since our Adventure Started, makes you think.We are now approaching the Flatlands of the Mountain and can see little dots on one of the Summits. That’s it, That’s ours, we push on really not feeling the strain of hiking up this steep incline. We see Tangerine coming down, we ask her how it was, she starts crying, oh no that starts me off. Then we meet Navster and Wyle they are both full, big hugs and congratulations, they have been waiting for us.We carry on I stop and wait for David we started together we will finish together. Mud goes on ahead to video us, we are now really close all the people on the Summit start to clap as we approach the sign, it’s Awesome, big fist pumps. We have done it, 2192 Miles, 6 months of Walking WOW.I get out my Flag that was given to me by John at Trailwalkers Gear in Bradenton, thanks John! I stand on the sign that so many thru hikers have stood on, I am in a daze hold up my flag, half USA, Half British, loads of photos then David and I hold the Flag what a team we are, We Have Done it! Still in a daze our Hiker Family is here, hand shaking fist pumping it is a very emotional place, day hikers are congratulating us , I am in tears. I feel a bit stupid but look around and all the Thru hikers have Red eyes, I take a walk out on to the knife edge. Wow that will soon bring you back to normality, on each side there are a couple of thousand foot drops !!!!!!Take it easy Colin you don’t want to slip here, we have lunch, then continue to applaud our friends making it to the summit it’s a Great Day, perfect weather, perfect friends.We start our descent down the Abol trail, it’s supposed to be safer, they are joking, it’s tough loose shale and boulders, then a detour a tough trail. You have to work hard to earn your, thru Hiker Status here then we are into the treeline and after a few miles we are back at Abol Bridge Campsite. We all meet up and get our ride back to town, time for a beer, every one meets at the pub for a few beers then dinner, then back to the pub.A Great Day, but What Now? We don’t have to walk tomorrow, No White Blazes to follow, No filtering Water, it’s Strange. This is going to be a challenge of its own. So will say Goodnight to you all it’s been a blast thanks for following my Adventure, I hope it’s inspired some of you to get out there, Thanks to you all.Anyone can walk on the flat, get out there take a chance you will change your life by living on the Edge.No more miles , what do I do now ??????????","Baxter campground

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603080,"Crazy BritWell we did it, but I am not a thru hiker yet. I still have 140 miles to get that status, this is because of when I had shin splints at the beginning of the trail, I had to miss this section so I will be going back to North Carolina in early October to get these miles done, then I can say i am a true Thru Hiker.The complete trail has to be done in one Calendar year. Back to the cold at this time of year, hopefully it won’t take long to do, just as long as I keep my trail legs going. So more walking every day and lots of bike riding, plus eating so I will put on some of the 26 lbs I lost whilst on the trail.The above weight sounds a lot, and it is, but that is about average loss for the trail. Just that I have always been skinny so it looks worse on me some guys and girls lost upwards of 40 lbs and that is not uncommon.At this time I would like to thank all my Fellow Hikers that I met on the trail, those of you that completed and those that sadly did not at this time, the Trail will still be there for you.For the Hotel and Hostel workers and owners, it was an Awesome experience to stay with you.For all the Trail workers who go quietly about there jobs, they are the unsung hero’s of the AT Trail system.For all the Trail Angels that turn up in the most remote places, with all their goodies all set up and a proper chair to sit on. A Bacon and Egg Sandwich never tasted so good, hot Coffee, a beer. You guys are like a racing pit crew, you keep us going, you don’t ask for anything in return, just have a good hike. You find out about Trail Angels Miles down the Trail, your spirits are uplifted, your pace quickens, you can smell bacon a long way away, Please let them be there when I get there, thank you All.For all the people that gave us Smelly Wet bedraggled hikers a ride, you will never know how much of a difference it made to our lives.To All our Family and Friends for your continued support, it’s great to be out in the Forest and get a ping on your phone, then to read a message of support from someone. It might be a small thing to you but to us, lots of times soaking wet, having to get water from a stream then filter it, for a simple cup of Hot Chocolate, a message of support is a big deal.To our Wives who obviously want us home but know we have to complete our mission, we all thank you so much, please be gentle when we get home we are a little bit different now!!!!Once again I thank my fellow hikers, your Laughter, tears of pain, will be forever etched in my memory, We did It!!!!!!!Lastly for my Hiking Partner David aka “ D Square” you taught me so much. I was the “Grasshopper"" Loosing stuff, forgetting stuff, to you a pain in the ass, but I am a stubborn Brit, who will never give up on a project. I owe you really deep appreciation and thanks.Any one I have missed I apologize to at the moment I am still in a bit of a Daze, it’s tough to Assimilate back into the normal life stream, I am not normal.I Am An Appalachian Thru Hiker.Live on the Edge it’s AwesomeWill meet you on the Journal again in.

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604632,"Crazy BritMy Return to the Trail, after summiting Mt Katahdin on 9.13.2018 it’s been a bit strange for me. Janice says I am not the same person, my love for the outdoors has grown I am different, in some ways. I have different values I suppose, our relationship is still as strong as it always has been, so that’s great.It’s got to change you a bit after you have been living in the woods for 6 months, with one other person 24-7 there were other people around but I was with David all the time.Not that we walked together, but we were always around.The biggest thing I am doing at this moment is trying to keep a mouse from climbing into my backpack. It's hanging in the shelter from an Anti mouse device, a can upside down with a string going thru the can center onto a stick this then hooks on to your bag, keeping the mouse at bay, so far it’s not working.This is my only worry apart from hanging my Bear Bag and collecting water from an ice cold spring. I am laid in my sleeping bag, drinking hot chocolate, and writing my Journal. All I need to know is that it’s not going to rain tonight, and tomorrow I have to hike 10 plus miles to get into Nantahala outdoor center. I have food and water and lots of Ibuprofen so I should be ok.Today started with a shuttle ride out from Nantahala to US 64 just outside of Franklin at a place called Winding Stair Gap, this was my Trailhead for today.I am headed North to a shelter at Cold Spring, some 15.8 miles along the trail. The trail is in a great condition just a bit wet from yesterday’s rain, but the good news is that it’s drying out fast, there are some ups and downs but not a lot, good news for me.The only big climb of the day is Wayah Bald up to the tower, from here there were some great views up North to the Smokies, this is my destination after another short section finishing on Saturday.The leaves are beginning to change and with a hard frost on Sunday we should see some dramatic changes in the Fall colors. The trail is drying out and there is a covering of dead leaves, this makes for a great rustling sound as you walk thru them.I had lunch at the Tower on top of Wayah Bald and met a southbound hiker who has only got 120 miles to go to finish at Springer Mountain in Georgia, I wished her all the best. It’s a great feeling to be getting that close to finishing this great adventure.From the Bald it was only a 6 mile hike to the shelter at Cold Spring, only saw another 3 hikers on the Trail, and I have the shelter all to myself. Well apart from the mice so I do have company, just hope they stay off my face!!!.There is a great spring here flowing thru a plastic pipe and yes it lives up to its name being ice cold, and it tastes so good, much better than city water.Well must close now as it’s gone past hiker midnight time for Bed. I was going to tent but it’s blowing like hell out there, better off in the shelter.As usual I will tell you it’s much better to live on the edge, stimulates the brain.Seems strange being on my own no Dave to talk to I will get used to it.","Winding stairs Gap

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604721,"Crazy BritNo miles today Must apologize for the absence of my last three Journal. My excuse is, my lens of my glasses fell out and I could not see to type without it, as it’s hard enough typing this journal into my phone in the first place. But now no more excuses, a nice lady came to my rescue, of course she had a little screwdriver to fix my problem so now all is good.I will give you a synopsis of the last three days.When I last wrote I was having a problem with mice in the Cold Spring Shelter, those bloody things drove me crazy, when I at last fell asleep I was woken by a scratching on my sleeping bag, I turned on my headlight and there was the cutest little mouse looking into my face,”Little ain’t got no father” I flicked him right out of the shelter.I am thinking of getting some cats and dropping them off in the shelters, charge the ATC a minimum sum to clean out the mouse problem.So woke up after a fitful sleep, thought that the mice might bring back their bigger brother the Bear, for the first time I was all alone in a shelter, Miles from anywhere, in Bear hunting season, so the bears are all pissed off. Thankfully I am so thin I could turn side ways and the Bear would miss me. ????? !!!!!.The Hiking is great leaves are all crunchy so you get a great sound walking, I feel good today putting in the miles North to the NOC, where I have a bunk.Thankfully I have a huge downhill to the NOC, and get there in good time feeling good, have a BLT in the restaurant, everything is good in the world.Get my Bunkroom have a shower and head into Bryson City where I Know there is a good Taproom, couple of Beers, a meal from the Taco Bus, ready for bed.Next day get a ride out to Yellow Stream Road and start to Hike South to the NOC.There are lots of bear hunters around so I take a lot of care, it’s a great hike, the Temps are a bit cool, well cold for a Florida Boy, but I only have about 14 miles to do today to get me to the Shelter on Sassafras Mountain, going is good. I stop for lunch by a highway and there are a lot of bear hunters trucks there. I never knew how valuable those hunting dogs were, the Top dogs you can buy are $20,000 plus, of course they have GPS collars to protect them and so the Hunters can follow them and shoot the Bear sitting up in the Tree. “ Great Sport” ????.Any way I got to the Shelter after the great views of the Smokies from on top of Cheoah Bald Mountain I descended to the Sassafras’s Shelter. Wow there were already 10 people there, 3 were tenting the rest in the shelter, good thing it’s a big 14 person two tier shelter. Of course I pick my spot, cook my dinner have a good conversation and go to bed. Only to find out I am between two really good snorers, one a man the other a woman. Now I don’t know if they were in competition with each other, but I had to hold myself back from giving them a dig in the ribs. The rain started at 4:27am I know that because I was awake with the snorers, it was really hard and heavy, it almost drowned out the snorers, but I must have slept, so all was not lost.It was still raining at 7:00 am so I laid in my sleeping bag and dozed, then made coffee and had my breakfast while everyone started milling around I only had 8 miles to do so no hurry.I packed my gear and started to hike, I like hiking in gentle rain, it brings out all the smells from the Forest, plus it cools you down hiking and it’s great at this time of year NO BUGS.Had a bit of a fall on top of the NOC, stupid me I could see the center, not looking at the ground slipped on a tree root, and ended up 10 ft down a bank. No damage except a sore hip and embarrassment to myself, normally I am so careful, but I could see and smell fresh coffee and real food.The only problem I have at the moment is that my Arthritis in my Big toes have decided to have a flair up and it’s giving me a bit of a problem. Hurts like hell, normally they hurt bad for an hour then they warm up, but now it hurts all day, Oh Hell it could be worse I could be working for a living?????.Got a bunk room at NOC and back into Bryson City to Refuel, great another Taco Truck and it’s not even Tuesday.
Sunday I have a Zero day no hiking lazy day had a good breakfast then went watching the Fly Fishing on the local rivers. Really impressed by the size of the brown Trout they were catching. Then went shopping for next week in the Smokies, being a good boy I decided to go back to my bunk room early, so on the way back I got some gas and went to pick up a beer, only to be told it’s a dry county out side of the City limits. Well that was enough to drive a sane person right back to the tap house, alls well that ends well. So Tomorrow I start hiking thru the Smokies starting at Fontana Dam looking forward to this part of the Adventure, so will write more in the Journal when I am back on the Trail. Until then all you couch potato’s get out there live on the Edge it will change your Life Forever. Only got the Smokies to do then I am a true thru hiker, more drivel tomorrow good night.","Cold Spring Shelter

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604740,"Crazy BritWell today was my first day in the Smokies, I got a shuttle out to Fontana Dam. It was all blocked off with construction work which worried me at first as I have to cross the top of the Dam, but not to worry I get waved right thru, being a thru hiker has some benefits.The walk over the Dam was really interesting as the mist was rising off the water making it look kind of Magical. There is a bit of a road walk to get to the trail head, but once there, it’s again uphill for a time. The Trail is in really good condition with lots of dead leaves making a carpet effect, the only problem with this is that the leaves cover the rocks and roots so from time to time you kick a damn rock, which is not good for my toes.At lunch time I stopped beside a hiker going South, he was a Ham Radio guy out doing a couple of the 181 summits that they use to speak to people all over the World his call sign was K2JB, a very interesting guy.It’s strange to see these leaves changing because when we started in March the trees were bare, then gradually as we progressed North and spring started these same leaves started to form a canopy over us known as the green tunnel. Now these leaves have done their job and are now changing color and dying, pretty cool living thru this evaluation.Had a great hike to the Mollies Shelter, there were a couple of hikers already there one from Manchester in England. She was hiking the trail for a couple of weeks, she did guiding for hikers in England and Iceland, cool job.Had my dinner and hot chocolate, we have lit a fire, this shelter has a fire place but we are getting smoked out, so we are putting it out, it was a great idea as it’s starting to get freezing cold, oh well soon be to E to get in my nice warm sleeping bag so will see you tomorrow.Remember to live on the Edge is really livingOnly got about 70 miles to go","Fontana Dam

So let the other guys get packed up then I went out.There was only one guy going north, he had left before me and I soon caught up with him. We had lunch together on the Rocky Top Bald, great place to just sit and enjoy the view, and enjoy a good lunch.The trail is in really great condition and I make great time. The leaves are getting deeper and deeper and crisper the sounds are Awesome.Thought about my good friend Pat Roberts who died early on this year when I was out hiking, miss his smiling face, it’s strange how these faces come to you when your out here on your own. I am heading for a shelter called Derrick Knob Shelter it’s a 12 person double decked place so should be plenty of room.There are some short sharp uphill sections really tough, but the views from some of the hill tops are awesome makes it all worth while. I get to the shelter and there are two girls there then in comes three others. When I was having dinner in came another two, going to be crowded tonight.

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604867,"Crazy BritWell as a piece more about our champion snorers in Derricks Knob Shelter, they were practicing a little when I got into my sleeping bag, not a good rendition just a few snorts. I dropped off to sleep, and was woken up by a complete overture of snoring. I wanted to give them a poke in the ribs, they both must have run thru their complete stock of snores, after this they started again, it was Bloody awful. Then I had a thought I had a set of ear plugs in my bag, so I got up put them in, could still hear a bit but I managed to go back to sleep.Now on to today’s hike. It is awesome out here, we had a frost first thing so that enhances the smells in the forest.Had some great climbs today, up and over Silers Bald some great views, then it was up and over Mt Buckley. It was here that I met a couple of young guys going South, got to talking as you do, or as I do, turns out that one of them is a pitcher for the Pittsburgh pirates. Told me his name was Holmes how can I forget that name, my Mothers Maiden name and our good friend Debbie Weeks Maiden name. Going to check him out when I get back, he said come out to the park, he will get me a beer, Nice Guy.I walked up to Clingmans Dome, such a disappointment for the Appalachian Trails highest Mountain. It was a little climb to the tower, no hand over hand stuff just a stroll thru the trees, “can’t work out how there are trees at 6600 ft yet up North tree line stops at 4500 ft”.The place was packed with people that had walked the Quarter of a mile from the Carpark, all the while asking where was the shuttle. Then when they got to the tower they had to rest, then decide if they could make it up the ramp to the viewing platform, I was blown away when one overly large guy said, they don’t have an Elevator.I just had to go to the top, whilst up there I was making a video and just happened to say, that it’s embarrassing for the third highest mountain East of the Mississippi to have an ugly concrete monstrosity built on it.Well this overly large man approached me and said how was he supposed to see the views if not for this structure, I said there are some great view points on the many trails in the Appalachian Mountains, to which he said how can I see them at my size!!!! I walked away with a smile, got my pack and headed into the woods. Did meet a cool hiker lady up there her name I think was Chocaholic, so all was not lost.It was a short hike to the shelter at Mt Collins Shelter, good place with some great guys. Some Cops and one Firefighter, also four SOBO thru hikers came in young guys with only about 202 miles to go they were super excited.Well don’t you know we have a couple more snorers, they must all be in a league on break, hiking the AT, these were good but I only gave them a 5 out of 10 as there friend gave them a poke so they went on their sides. I still had my ear plugs so it wasn’t to bad, good nights sleep. Full moon so it’s going to be cold.Time for Bed see you all tomorrow.OK You All really need you all to put a little effort into living on the Edge, can tell you that you will thank me.","Derricks Knob Shelter

It was a great hike thru the forest today just wish I could capture the different smells for you, they are Awesome. Met a few hikers coming South one I recognized from up in New Hampshire, he had broke some fingers at Abol Bridge and had to take some time off the trail. Now he was back Flip Flopping heading towards Springer Mountain in Georgia, good luck to him.Again a great hike through these great forests, I am heading to Newfound Gap where I can get a ride into Gatlinburg. A weird place, after a couple of hours I come out on the Gap there are hundreds of cars there. This is on the North Carolina and Tennessee border, lots of people park here to see the view then head up to Clingmans Dome.I take some photos and walk out to the road to hitch a lift into town. After about 6 cars a truck stopped, asked where I was going, I said into town, the guy said get in the Cab or in the Truck Bed. I elected for the truck bed I am a bit smelly, I was told to help myself to a Mountain Dew, or a Gatorade, Nice.Had a great ride into town lots of cars around. When we got to Gatlinburg the truck stopped and the drivers wife got out and asked me if I was a thru hiker. She asked me my Trail name and when I said Crazy Brit she was so pleased. Turns out she had been following me on Trail Journals, and it was her ambition to hike the Trail. Her name was Lisa, I thank you and your husband so much especially when they were going out of their way, thank you so much Lisa.I had to walk thru this strange place of Gatlinburg, it’s like Las Vegas in the Tennessee Mountains weird.Found my hotel but I was early so left my bags there and went down to the Main Strip, just across the road was a Margaritaville Bar, told you it was weird.

Started off great with a shuttle by Lee Ann up to Newfound Gap, just a couple of cars up there today. Wind was blowing and it was raining and cold. Lee Ann said are you sure you want to do this, I had made up my mind to go, I had on my waterproofs, got all my gear together and after signing her log book I was off into the mist.As you would expect the trail is flooded with rain water running off the mountains. The trail is a perfect channel for the rain to run down, it’s not long before my feet are soaking wet, my arthritis loves this feet are a tad sore.Strange your feet warm up the water then it’s not too bad, not good, but not to bad. It’s the wind that is the problem blowing thru the trees, we passed some blown down driving up the the Gap. There are a couple of trees down but not large enough to block the trail.Coming up the trail are a group of young men and women, they are going South to Georgia to finish a thru Hike, they ask my name, when I tell them Crazy Brit, the girl said she had met David and Myself up in Vermont. She was coming South, that was pretty cool they were all happy that they only had just under 200 miles to finish, when told them I have just over 20 miles, they gave a big cheer, life is good.I had to hike along this Ridge which took most of the day, it got really cold with the wind chill and the rain beating down. Then in a pine section of the trail, along came two hikers from Austria, real nice young men they asked where I was going today, when I told them I was finishing up my thru hike, they got out a flask of Whiskey and we toasted the Appalachian Trail, Awesome.I am headed for the Shelter at Pecks Corner Shelter, it’s .4 off the trail a long walk to get to a shelter but what the hell its cold and wet and I can get into dry clothes and eat some warm food.The shelter is empty so I spread all my stuff out to Dry, fat chance of that is really damp, so tomorrow it will be getting into a pair of Wet Shoes!!!!!!!

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604924,"Crazy BritWell today is a bittersweet day as it’s the last night I will spend in a shelter on my thru hike of the Appalachian Trail in 2018. Its been a great trip met a whole lot of really great people, men and women with one goal to complete a thru hike, and of course those that are just out to do a few sections, with the promise that they don’t know how long it will take, but hopefully they will fulfill their dream. I feel very sad for the hikers that have had to leave the trail for one reason or another, it will still be out there waiting for you.We envy the section hikers as in a few days they will go home to a warm house with hot showers, and a faucet you can just turn a handle and water will come out!!!!.Today has been a really tough day, it’s been really really and I do mean really cold. The zipper broke on my rain jacket which was not a good thing so I have it folded around me, my waterproof gloves which cost a fortune have lost their waterproofness.Of course with all this nonstop rain the mountains are full of water, and the man made AT Trail is a perfect channel. I have 3 pairs of socks one is in my sleeping bag and is only for nighttime use, nice wooly socks perfect!!! My other socks and liners are soaking wet from wading in the endless stream of water, which I might add is freezing cold. I have on my thermal long johns with my waterproof trousers, these work great.I have on a long sleeved thermal top, an anti sweat tee shirt, a mid layer jacket, and a waterproof top. On my head I have a buff, a peaked cap and the hood from the waterproof jacket. So you can see I am all ready for the cold, but it’s still cold.Now it’s going to be sweet going home to Janice, great bed cuddles at night, a shower, great food to fatten me up, seeing Stacy and Sandra and Little Wyatt, the only other male in the house. I can go fishing with my mate Hobie, going sailing on Sunday with Greg Petrat on his Schooner at a great regatta.Of course I have my workshop got to do some projects in there related to the AT Trail, so I am a lucky man at my age of almost 71 years old, to hike this trail of 2189 miles in one calendar year, I am very thankful. My thanks go out to my Great Friend David who taught me the ropes, he is a great Guy.There is not a lot to say about today’s hike it was 12.9 miles of slogging it out in the rain, wading at times. I even got blown off the trail by gusts of wind, it was that powerful today. There were no views as I was hiking on a ridge line at about 4000 to 5000 ft up in the famous Smokies clouds. So it was keep warm by keep hiking only took two short breaks as you soon start to feel the coldness starting to penetrate. It’s tough because I have one of the best puffy jackets you can buy a Montbell 900 fill with a hood but it’s no good in the rain as it’s Goose Down, once wet is worse than useless.So that was my day, I am sorry that it will be over, hope I readjust to normal life, and not be too much of a pain.Even as bad as today was, am I going to miss it, you can bet I will. Tomorrow I will be a Thru Hiker on one of the Worlds Top Ten Hiking Trails, and I Love it out Here!!!!!!.I am sat in my sleeping bag with my Puffy on woolly socks and thermals, drinking a Hot chocolate, it really is simple!!My good friend Dan Caruso is going to be waiting for me as I come out of the Forest at Davenport Gap tomorrow to drive me back to Nantahala to get my car I will then visit with him, looking forward to seeing his house he is restoring in Blowing Rock. Then on the way home have a visit with Juliet my Stepdaughter, looking forward to seeing herAs you read this I hope it will give you an insight into living on the edge, all you have to do is take that first step, you won’t regret it","Pecks Corner Shelter

Crazy Brit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605137,"Crazy BritI must apologize seems I forgot to send my last message for posting on my AT journal, must have been so excited to finish will get it done.Had a great night all be it freezing cold, good job the shelter had a tarp over the front as the wind was blowing right into the shelter. Why do they build these shelters on the windward side of the mountain.There was only one other guy in there, so plenty of room, had a load of mice there running around all night. Had a pretty good nights sleep, but I am super excited to be finishing tomorrow.I have called Dan and told him that I will be coming out of the forest at 2:00 pm. So in the morning I have my coffee sat in my nice warm sleeping bag, the guy I shared the shelter with has packed up and left he has 200 plus miles to go to finish his thru Hike, he is happy to be this close, I have given him my emergency supply of food.So today I will be done with this Adventure, but first I have to put on cold wet liners and I am going to wear my last pair of dry over socks. Ohhhh, my feet are cold, but they will warm up as I start to hike. I am going to wear my nice warm puffy as its not raining and all my other stuff is wet and cold.So all packed up and ready to hit the trail, the leaves are changing real fast now its got cold, and they are really falling from the trees as its blowing hard, most of my hike is down hill today so I can make good time.There is not a lot of water on the trail, another bonus, so I am headed for a view point where I can send out a Facebook Live Video. I arrive at the view point and its spectacular with all the fall foliage changing colors. I have picked some leaves to press dont know how they will turn out???.I call Janice, also Hobie and Greg today. I will be back for the Reggata on Saturday, Face Time home. I am back on the trail, doing great meet some young hikers turns out we met up in Vermont, whilst we were getting water, also a young girl had found one of our plastic Frogs and had taken it to Katahdin, then sent it home for safe keeping, that was really cool.I told Dan I would be out of the Forest at 2:00 pm so I am going at a good pace to be on time.Its getting close, I am going down hill pretty fast and then I see Dans Truck, I give out a shout, Dan is out of the truck, big Hugs I told him I have to walk up to past the underpass to be complete.DONE IT YES !!!!!!!!!.Dan has driven 144 miles to meet me, now he is going to drive me to Nantahala Gorge so I can get my car, another 98 miles I will then follow him home to Blowing Rock.A round trip of 484 miles that is a true friend.Dan and Susan and Myself go out to dinner to celebrate and have a couple of beers, Two Thru Hikers together. Next day I go to the home he is renovating for himself, a true craftsman, doing a great job, its going to look Awesome when its finished, and he has a to Die for Large Workshop I am so envious.After leaving Dan's home In Blowing Rock, I head down the mountain to Hickory to visit Juliet my Step Daughter, she has a new Office, I am so proud of her she is one of the top State Farm Agencies in the area, she is a remarkable woman who has risen to the top thru a lot of adversities, I am so proud of her.I am invited to stay the night this will be great I get to meet Matt her Fianc again. We go out to dinner at a really nice restaurant, then home to catch up on all the news, and drink some wine. Next day I am up drinking coffee when Juliet gets up, Matt has all ready left for work, so another coffee and I am ready to drive home to Florida.On the way home I will call in on my great friend Steve Coan, he has just won his bout with Cancer but has a few other problems. When I call him he has just come out of surgery and is still a bit dopey from the anesthetic, so will have to see him at a later date.Driving thru Florida I call Steve Pettingill to see if he is working on Stanley Pariss boat, yes he is so I am invited to come on over and yes you are staying the night.Steve and Patty his wife have a great home out in the country!!!!! Well it was now they are putting a huge development right behind his property, Oh My!!!! Steve is not impressed. After dinner we start chatting Patty is off to bed, we chat and chat its after 1:00 am when we go to bed, less two bottles of wine.In the morning we go down to Stanely Pariss boat his second boat. Built so he can be the oldest man to sail around the world non stop and also break Dodge Morgans record, its a cool boat designed by Finot Conq at 52 ft OA its shorter than his old boat but lighter and faster, this will be his fourth and last attempt, best of luck Stanley.I give Steve a hand to Bend on the Sails, get an in depth tour of the boat, I helped them take the old Kiwi Spirit up to Rhode Island a couple of years ago.Have lunch and I am back on the road, these last few days visiting has been great, but my Adventure has to end some time.I get home to a great welcome from Janice and the family, they are all set up for Halloween, chairs and goodies out in the driveway ready for the trick or treaters, have a load of them another great night.I know I have rambled on in my Journal, just trying to give you an insight to my life on the trail the good and not so good. I had a great time sharing it with you all, tho got to admit after a hard day, it was even harder typing into a phone and get it sent off to Stacy who would then upload it to the AT Trail journals, thank you Stacy.My thanks to everyone I met, thanks to David my teacher without whom I would still be in Georgia?????Thanks to Janice for supporting me in this Adventure and being on her own for 6 months.Thanks to all the journal readers, it was a Blast.Thank you all","Crosby Mountain Shelter
