I am not typically a blogger, so I will warn you now, spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors will happen!5 weeks until we get on the plane for Baltimore. My daughter and I plan to hike the Appalachian trail southbound from Harpers Ferry WV to Bristol TN, roughly 600 mi. We are planning to do this over 2 months. I am so excited I cannot stand myself. But before we can leave, Jessica’s graduation from highschool has to happen. She is also excited and has so much to do before we leave.. me too.",,"Portland, OR","May 02, Wed",0
Solar Power and Pop (Tracey and Jessica),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591226,"Less than 2 weeks left. Tuesday, we have guests arriving and and Jessica graduates on Friday. Lots going on this week!
Today I was looking at the pile of gear. I know what I need, but I don't know how to fit it all in the backpack! I am switching to an internal frame from an external frame, and needless to say, it's lots smaller. I also decided to carry a bear can. I know that lots of hikers say that this is silly and unnecessary, but the only way to stop bears from frequenting shelters is to make sure there is no food they can access. There are already 2 shelters closed on the route that are closed due to problem bears. I already know that I am terrible at hanging bear bags, so I'll carry the can. Besides, it doubles as a chair.
That said, I takes up tons of room in the pack, so I guess I'm playing Tetris with round blocks!",,View Entry,"May 21, Mon",0

I started decades ago with liners and scratchy wool socks. then I changed to Smartwool socks. Those were ok until they got stretched out. Last year I tried Darn Tough. I love those socks! Unfortunately, they wore out quickly. Not holes per se, but the wool wore off in a few spots, mostly where the arches of my Smartfeet insoles rub. However, Darn Tough honored the warranty and sent me new socks! I'm going to keep using Darn Tough. I feel bad, because I feel that I will probably wear more holes in more of their socks, but they fit the best.",,View Entry,"May 21, Mon",0

When we went to check in we realized that we were supposed to go to Oakland Airport! So after calling my my husband, he came back and picked us up for the ride over to Oakland.

Solar Power and Pop (Tracey and Jessica),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592921,"So we finally made it to Harpers Ferry. What an adventure! This afternoon we took the train to Washington DC to catch the train here. About 30 minutes before our train headed out, they cancelled it due to water and trees on the track. Anyone going to locations between DC and PIttsburg PA had to find their own alternate transportation. We checked the bus, and it was sold out. We ended up getting one of the last rental cars for a ridiculous price. Then we battled the train and traffic out of DC to get here. Now tomorrow, we got to drop off the car in the next town and catch the bus back to the trail, before starting our 8 mile day. I hope things get easier away from civilization!","Baltimore MD

Solar Power and Pop (Tracey and Jessica),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593084,"Today was our first trail day! We got a very late start due to having to return the rental car. We arrived at the trail around 10:15.
The trail southbound out of Harpers Ferry is very steep. It is nicely switch backed, but it is very rocky and full of roots compared to the PCT. it seriously takes a toll on your feet. This year I am trying a hoot that is very similar to a trail runner. The brand is Hoka One One. They have lots of padding. But, Unlike my old boots, you can feel the rocks under these. I may have to switch back to my old ones. If anyone knows of a good boot that has a stiff sole and is good for metatarsal issues, please let me know. I will keep using these to see if it gets any better. 
The trail is beautiful. Very lush with new plants and so green! We only had one view today, but it was great. We passed at least 30 thru hikers also. Most of the other hikers are very friendly.We saw an odd thing today. We saw 4 caterpillars following each other end to end so closely, we thought it was one caterpillar. Then we saw a slug following them, as if it was chasing them. Run caterpillars run! Do slugs eat caterpillars?
Tonight we are at the shelter, which is the fanciest one I have ever seen. It has a deck, benches, a separate covered eating area, and a horseshoe pit. Pretty nice! We did the camp chores and cooked dinner. After dinner we went through the food and realized how little we had eaten throughout the day. So we had a big dessert. Granola bars, dried fruit, and brownies!","Harpers Ferry

I thought that we may need to start slow, so I planned for us to stay at the Bears Den Hostel run by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club. We also sent a mail drop to the Hostel for a resupply. We got there at about lunch time. Jessica wade looking forward to non dairy ice cream and pizza. We met lots of interesting hikersthere - Nome, ET, Train Wreck, and a couple of others. It was very nice and comfortable. Unfortunately, the combination of pizza and hiking was not a good thing for Jessica, and she got sick.We both got trail names though. I am solar powered because of the large solar panel I carry. Jessica is Pop because she pops her jaw in her sleep and all the hikers were wondering what th noise was.","Communication Tower Tentsite

Solar Power and Pop (Tracey and Jessica),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593470,"Needless to say when we woke up this morning, everything hurt. By 7am, everyone in the shelter had pretty much left. So we were able to slowly pack up, eat breakfast (oatmeal), stretch, and leave. Today didn’t seem like too hard a day on the map, The climb out of the shelter area was tough only because of how sore we were. The day’s climbs were fairly gradual, just long. The trail passed through dense deciduous forest and then emerged into a mountain top meadow. We climbed gradually through the meadow, full of plants such as grasses, mayapple, blackberries, wild strawberries. Butterflies were flying around chasing each other.  The meadow gave way to a shrubby forested section where honeysuckle vines were climbing up many of the bushes and trees. There were so many song birds singing too. I wish I knew the types of birds singing. After reaching the top of the mountain, we descended into a gap to the shelter. The new shelter is great. However, there is no functional privy. I hope they fix that soon for other hikers. Tomorrow we are thinking of taking a short day. Jessica’s foot hurts and she needs a day to baby it. We have plenty of time and food, so we will probably stay the night at Manassas Shelter.","Rod Hollow Shelter

Solar Power and Pop (Tracey and Jessica),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593565,"Today as a beautiful day on the trail. We climbed through deciduous forests and ran across the top of a ridge line for half the day. We had lunch at Manassas Shelter. There was a nice sunny spot for the solar panel, so I took advantage of it. There was a black racer  snake in the rafters. I guess it was a resident because someone wrote a warning on the side of the shelter. At least that shelter doesn’t have a mouse problem! As we were getting ready to leave, we met 3 women, my age, who were hiking together. They were doing the same miles as us. Way to go!
The second half of the day was a tough climb. Not really, but it felt like it. There was a beautiful meadow at the top with a bench, so we sat and talked for a few minutes. It’s funny, because Jessica asked me a question about a movie that led to talking about the Ten Commandments. That’s when we heard the thunder. We had 2 miles left to travel so we started racing down the trail. We had to climb at the end and I wasn’t sure we were going to make the shelter. I kept praying for the rain to hold off. In the end we walked into the shelter 20 seconds before the rain. Wow! I guess I did something right in that conversation at the bench. Another hiker was not so lucky and got here just as the torrential rain started. We had a cold dinner and went to bed.","Whisky Hollow Shelter

Solar Power and Pop (Tracey and Jessica),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594012,"We had a big climb today and then a downhill walk to the Mountain Home B&B. We decided to do our resupply and look for some replacement gear. My water hose broke where it attached to my hydration bladder and I needed another pair of sock liners.
The owners of the B&B had us sleep in the main house instead of the hostel cabin. It was wonderful! We ended up with a room to ourselves the first night. The House was under construction as Scott and Lisa are renovating it. But they welcomed us into their home and we had access to laundry, showers, beds, breakfast, and they shutled us to town anytime we wanted it. They also told us where all the good shops and burger joints were.","Jim and Molly Denton Shelter

We passed by the Smithsonian conservation area. It has fences all around. Jessica thinks it’s Jurassic Park. There were some beautiful views of Front Royal area and conservation grounds.
Climb wasn’t too bad. Feeling energized by the zero day.
Scott told us how to ford one of the streams using the road and culvert. The trail was as he described, as well as the campsite. All his advise has been spot on.
Climb up wasn’t bad. Lots of switchbacks to ease the way. Also, very few rocks.
When we got close to Tom Floyd Wayside, we saw a blue blaze for the spring. Unlike the actual AT, it was a lot of straight up, but we managed. The spring was so deep into the rocks, you needed a scoop to get the water out.
The climb up to the shelter was very steep. The shelter had a big sign warning about norovirus (stomach flu from hell) and to wash your hands frequently. The thought of the illness made me less than comfortable. So we left.
We found out campsite by 4:30 pm. We set up the tent and had dinner. By 8:00 8 more thru hikes had arrived. So we have a full camp tonight.","Mountain Home B&B

After an oatmeal meal breakfast we wee out of camp by 7:30 am. The first two miles went fast and we climbed 1000 ft. There were beautiful views of the valley at Hogback Overlook. Joanne, a trail runner we met yesterday took our picture. She has been the best person we have met up here. She has given us some great info as well as chatting with us and other hikers in the evening. 
By 11:30 we had completed 5.5 miles and stopped for lunch at the Elkwallow Wayside. The burger and fries were wonderful! We hung out for 2 hours, staying longer because Joanne caught up to us, and eating and chatting with her. We then left and finished the next 7.5 miles by 6 pm.
We saw some wildlife today. Lots of millipedes, a buck, a doe, a dung beetle. Last night we heard a fawn get killed by another animal. Very sad.
We met Mountain Goat, Protégée, and 21 hikers who were students from an international school.","Gravel Springs Hut

Solar Power and Pop (Tracey and Jessica),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594439,"We slept in the shelter last night. I was happy about that because it is a stone building, and the bears usually hang out behind the shelter because There are blackberry bushes there. Unfortunately, so are the tent sites.
We ate our oatmeal in preparation for the long day. We had two big climbs before lunch today, so we wanted to get out early. We left camp at 8 am. The fist climb wasn’t too bad, but the last one was tough. Today’s trail was all rocks. Small ones, big ones, ones stuck in the earth pointy side up. It hurts the feet and ankles. Jessica had almost given up when we finally saw the summit with the restaurant on it. We had a burger and soda.
For some reason the burger made us sleepy instead of invigorated like the other day. The last 4.5 miles were tough.
We got to the shelter and grabbed the last tent spot. We talked to Joanne some and because we shared our water yesterday, she got our water for us today. There is a family from France doing the trail for 4 weeks, two through hikers, and a group of scouts.Unfortunately, the scout troop was on their very first trip. They had no experience and it looked like the leaders didn't do any training either. They didn't give the organization a good look.","Byrd’s Nest #3

Today we woke up at 7 am and just laid in our sleeping bags until 7:45 am. We knew we only had 3 miles to hike today before reaching our destination of Big Meadows. When we went to get our food this morning we were treated to a nasty surprise, a raccoon had shredded my stuff sack. At night I hung it on the bear pole filled with smellables that won't fit in the bear can. Unfortunately it was my sleeping bag stuff sack. I'll have to find a new one in Waynesboro.  All the food was fine as it was in the bear cans.
We had eggs and hash browns for breakfast and left camp at 10:30. The trail was better today with less rocks. We descended to some nice viewpoints of the valley and we ascended to the campground. We got here at 12:30 PM. We got a nice campsite by the ranger check - in station which is close to the laundry and showers.
We took our showers and spent a few hours doing laundry and playing cards. The campstore supervisor helped me out by giving me a trash bag for my clothes. Now I can use the waterproof stuff sack on my sleeping bag. The lady working here also took pity on us and let us buy two sodas from her car since the soda machine was broken. Thank you Trail Angles!
After we walked the mile down to the Wayside and went tho the camp store to price the resupply food and pick up some regular camping food. Tonight we had hotdogs and buns, tomorrow will be pancakes for breakfast, spaghetti and hotdogs for lunch. Tomorrow we will have to go down to the Wayside again to get our resupply.
Lots of Northbound thru-hikers have come by to camp for the night and get laundry done. A funny thing, you know who is a thru hiker because they wear the rain pants and jacket while their laundry gets washed because they do not carry extra clothes. Us too. It is strange though, staying at a campground. When we look like long distance hikers, thru hikers are pleasant and say hello. When we are cleaned up and not carrying packs, they just look at us and don't say anything. Strange how we group ourselves, even in the woods.","Rock Spring Shelter

Today is a zero day, no trail distance done. We had to go back to the Wayside, so we actually got 2 miles in. It is so nice to wake up in the tent and just listen to the birds. At 9 am it is cool and sunny. Our tent is set up under a nice shade tree and we have a bear box to protect all our food and gear.
The park has these beautiful song birds that sing all day long. But there is another thing that just yells. I would say it is a ""Caw"" sound but it is more of a ""Yaahhh"" sound. I think it is a type of crow or raven?.
Got up around 9 am and made pancakes with basic corn syrup style maple syrup. They were very good. It is funny that basic, no frills, normal food that we would normally opt not to eat, for one reason or another, is very good after two weeks of cheese crackers, granola bars, an Lipton side dishes.
We then decided how much food we needed to buy for the resupply, so we didn't buy too much like in Front Royal, and went down to the Wayside. We saw a deer jumping on the way. We had lunch and tried to buy what we needed. It was about double the cost it should have been, but that wasn't surprising. We are a captive audience here. We then went back to camp and took a nap.
Since we could, we washed the clothes we wore today and took another shower. Bugs are out en mass tonight. Also pretty hot and muggy outside. Jessica's sleeping pad keeps deflating. I'll switch with her tonight so she can sleep well. I try to be good. Another item to replace in Waynesboro.","Big Meadows Campground

It was a beautiful clear morning with a cool breeze. You could tell that the day would be hot, so the breeze was appreciated. We walked through lots of dense vegetation so I kept looking for a bears, but didn't see any. We did see a tiny ring neck snake, chipmunks, a deer, and heard lots of birds.We have finally reached the southern section of the park. The northern section is dominated by views of the valley containing the town of Luray, but now we are beginning to walk behind another grouping of mountains, so our views are of those. We didn't stop for many breaks due to the persistent bugs, but ate our snacks on the move. Amazingly we didn't feel exhausted or tired and completed the 9.2 miles in 5 hours! We were shocked. This was a first for us!We picked a site at the Lewis Mountain Campground and set up camp. It was hot and sunny, and the bugs were terrible. I bought more bug spray at the store and it was the only ting keeping us sane. At 4:30 pm we went to take a shower at the campstore, and a light summer rain shower started outside. It broke the heat, so it was nice. When it stopped, I began to make dinner. Five minutes later the skies opened up and dropped a deluge! The campers next to us, a Dad and his 2 daughters, waved us over to their site and let us cook under his pop up canopy. They were very nice and even offered us cookies! We made Backpacker Pantry Pasta Primavera. It was delicious. Jessica wasn't impressed with it, too many veggies. When the rain ended about 30 minutes later, we cleaned up, hung our bear cans in empty firewood bags (We were instructed to do this by the campground host) on the bear pole. We went to the tent and played some Cribbage. Jessica won, she was ecstatic! There is no cell service so I have been sending Michael, my husband, update texts via the Garmin Satellite Service.

Decent: 4211 ftToday was the most challenging day for both of us. As you can see from the numbers we climbed and descended almost twice what we normally do. In addition we walked two days worth of miles. We did this because we wanted to get to town a day early. We have been dealing with rain, bugs, and mud since Lewis Mountain Campground, and just wanted to get clean. We ate breakfast and left camp by 8 am. Nothing had bothered our bear cans during the night, so that was nice. The hike was pretty uneventful, no views and no water, until we got to mile 9 near Calf Mountain. It was here that Jessica had a close encounter with a bear. She was taking a picture of a plant, and heard a crashing noise. As she looked up, a bear ran through the woods, passing about 10 ft from her. She was so scared she couldn't even scream. She thought it was charging her. As it turned out, it was just running and went past without incident, however, she had a major shock. When I caught up with her, she was still standing there breathing heavy, and partially crying. However, as she told the story, she starting laughing, so she is fine.As we were climbing Calf Mountain, we started hearing thunder in the distance. We knew another afternoon storm had formed and was approaching. Unfortunately, you can only climb so fast, so we reconciled with being wet again. However, we seemed to be right on the edge of it. As we climbed, we could feel the pressure change and heard the wind roaring down on us. It was so odd though to get hit with the wall of wind (it felt like when you get hit by a wave in the ocean) and not get hit by the rain. Well the wind kept coming, but no rain, so we kept climbing. A few minutes later we got to the shelter path. Half way down I heard the sound change and knew rain was chasing us. I told Jessica to run and we did. The downpour began 2 seconds after we got under the shelter awning. So lucky! It was an amazing experience. We spent the next 45 minutes dry and out of the rain, chatting with the 4 hikers who were there. We made it 10.5 miles to Calf Mountain Shelter by 3 pm. We had now left the Shenandoah National Park.We left the shelter at 3:45pm and began that last 7.1 miles of our trip. Let us just say that the last 7 miles may not look like much on a profile map, but was the hardest stretch of trail we have encountered yet. It looked like the trails in Vermont and NH - no switch backed trails, boulders everywhere, very strenuous. We had a couple of good views, but it was a struggle. For instance, lets say that you are going down a quarter mile street and you will descend 100 ft in the process. Then throw in four 6ft boulders to climb over and a 30 foot straight up section in the process. The profile map will just show a slanted line with a little squiggle in the middle. But when you have to climb over the squiggle, it isn't so little, especially after 14 miles of hiking. Jessica was very encouraging, she wanted to make it even though she was sore and hurting too. We made the end, Rockfish Gap by 8:45 pm. We walked over to the info center and tried to decide what to do. I had prayed for help for the last 2 miles, and 30 seconds after reaching the info center, Frank, a day hiker offered to help us. The more time you spend out in the woods, the more you have faith in God. We got to the hotel and into our room by 9:30 pm. Looking forward to 2 zero days.","Riprap Trail Stealth Site

We are staying at the Quality Inn, and the bed is very comfortable, but due to our high mileage yesterday, I had leg spasms all night, despite the 3 Aleve I took before bed. We decided to get up at 8 am for breakfast, which was included in the room fee. It was good - waffles, eggs, gravy, etc. We then got a Lyft ride to the local Rockfish Gap Outfitter. They were very helpful as I needed to buy a new sleeping mat and stuff sack. A local trail angel, Mark, was driving another hiker to the outfitter and offered us a ride back to the McDonalds in Waynesboro. He also told us about 2 local events happening tonight in case we were looking for entertainment. We ate and then started our resupply, mostly drug store items. We also picked up a sub for dinner at Subway. We walked back to the Hotel, dropped off our purchases, and then went to the Post Office where all our boxes were waiting. They all made it! Yay! We were very happy when we got back to the hotel with our stuff. We were tired, so were going to watch a movie. I took out my new sleeping pad and was instantly sad. I found that I had grabbed the wrong mat (a prolite vs a prolite plus) and need to go back tomorrow and return it. I called the Outfitter and they put one behind the counter for me.

Today we left Waynesboro after 2 days off trail. The 18 mile day took a lot out of us and we were still limping around by the evening of that first day off. Today we felt good so we started toward Glasgow. We should be there in a week. 
We caught a Lyft ride to the trailhead and started hiking at 10 am. The trail today was very nicely maintained. The club in charge of this section is the Old Dominion Appalachian Trail Club. The grade was good and it was a pleasant hike. We got to Paul Wolfe Shelter by 1 pm. It is a beautiful new shelter. The builders did a great job. It has windows, a nice finished floor, an upper bunk and a porch. The site was beautiful too with lots of tent spots and a beautiful stream running in front. We took a two hour lunch break there. At 3 pm we headed up Humpback Mountain. 3 miles in we reached our site for the evening. We will finish the climb tomorrow. We made it by 5:30pm. 
When we got here I told Pop to set up the tent while I get the water. I had to hike up to the spring 0.2 mi up the trail. I told her to wear her whistle in case she needed help she could blow it and I would hear. So she did. When I got back she said that she heard an animal walking through the bushes. She almost blew the whistle until she realized  that it was just a deer. After er getting a close up of 3 bears in the Shenandoahs, she doesn’t really want to see any more.
Tonight we are camping in the woods, so we hung a bear bag with any smellables that wouldn’t fit on the bear cans. We put the bear cans in a different location from the bag. We’ll see if we succeeded at avoiding the animals in the morning.","Waynesboro. VA

We were a bit slow getting out of bed this morning. We had no animal visitors, so our food and smellables are intact, yay! Breakfast this morning was dehydrated sweet potatoes and grits. The sweet potatoes were baked, prepared with sugar, mashed, dried, powdered in the blender, and vacuum packed before the trip. They are very good, especially when I mixed them with buttered grits, but they just don’t pack the power punch for breakfast. Climbing the first 1000 feet this morning was a tough slog and the trail wasn’t all that steep. I guess sweet potatoes will be dinner fare only.
We ate lunch at the beautiful Wintergreen Overlook. It is a view that looks down in the Wintergreen Ski Resort. I didn’t know Virginia had ski areas.
The hike down from Humpback Mtn was a killer. All rocks and 12” stairs. My knees were screaming by the bottom. The rest of the day was the same, lots of unsteady rocks, tripping, slipping, and it was hot too. It was not a fun day and I was so focused on my footing that I didn’t see much. However, we did pass two of the best views of the whole trip.
It was not a good day to make high mileage as we were only averaging a mile per hour with the trail conditions. I started looking for alternate places to camp when I realized hat we were close to the Devils Backbone Brewery. It is a real brewery, but also has a restaurant, campground, showers, and a shuttle back to the trail in the morning. We decided to go for it. We got to Reeds Gap at 6pm and by 6:20 pm we hitched a ride and were on our way to the Brewery. We had dinner, set up camp, and now it’s bed time at 10pm.","Stealth site on Humpback Mountain

Last night we tried to charge the phones and the backup battery wouldn’t charge them. I think something is.occurring between charging it with the solar panel and the 99% humidity. So, I stayed up until past midnight charging the phones in the bathroom. 
We got up early to attend the hiker breakfast. Coffee, 2 eggs, potatoes, toast, jam, and a huge bowl of oatmeal for $5. Can’t beat that. We were also able to charge our phones more and call Michael about the issue with the battery. We went back to our campsite to pack up in time for the shuttle that is provided by the Brewery. We caught the shuttle in time and were dropped off at Reed Gap. We headed up Bee Mountain and then continued up  to Three Ridges Peak. It was a very hot and humid day, but we made it. We saw some amazing views, especially at Hanging Rock Overlook. We met some other SoBos here. Theyy were hiking the loop crated by the AT and Mar-Har trail. In the afternoon we descended steeply to the Shelter. We decided to stay in the shelter because we needed to get up early to climb the Priest mountain tomorrow. We thought we might have the shelter to ourselves, as all the SoBos had tented on the sloping tentsites. However, when we laid down at 8:00pm for bed, 2 thru hikers showed up. They were very polite and quiet while they set up and ate. I fell asleep before they were done.","Devils Backbone Brewery Campground

We woke up at 6:00, packed up and hit the trail. Today we had to climb the last little bit and descend to the Tye River. We could tell that it was going to be a hot day. The heatwave has hit and is making climbing very difficult. I can only hike half as fast in the extreme heat.
The Tye River has a gorgeous suspension bridge across it. Pop didn’t like the fact that it sways and moves as you walk across it. There was also some trail magic at the trail head, cold Dr Peppers. We had a snack, then started up the Priest. 
The mountain is dreaded on the trail because it is a 3000 ft climb in 4 miles. It is very steep. Interesting enough, the climb is split into 3 equal segments. The first 1.3 miles brings you to a good water source, Cripple Creek. The second 1.4 miles brings you to a rock outcropping with a great view. The last 1.3 brings you to the top.
As we started up, the heat combined with a stomach full of a Snickers Bar, Dr Pepper, and Fruit Bar, made me totally nauseous. So I was pretty miserable. Also by the time we got to the Creek, I was literally dripping with sweat. The creek had a deep, 6” deep, spot downstream past where people would collect water, so I sat in it to cool my body down. I felt much better when we left 30 min later. While we were there we were passed by two women, sisters, who were also having heat problems like us. They were very friendly, and were a highschool counselor and a teacher on summer break. They had been doing sections for the past 12 years, starting at Springer,  and had made it to our section this year. They were hiking SoBo as well. 
We had lunch at the view and rested there to cool down. We were pretty wiped out at this point. We had only 1000 ft and 1.3 mi left. It was almost vertical. When I put my foot down, my toe was so much higher than my heel that my Achilles tendon started spasming. We made it to the top and stood on the Ledges for a beautiful view of the valley. We met the sisters there along with their two friends, also educators. We all then continued to the Priest Shelter. 
When we got to the shelter we found the spring was low, the privy was disgusting, and there as a group of college students set up to party at one of the tent sites. It had to happen at some point I guess. However, the TrailRunner  arrived, so the party never happened. 
We also were joined by 2 thru-hikers and another section hiker. We had fun talking to everyone and met some great people. The TrailRunner was friendly and gave everyone a lesson on Leave No Trace.
He did tell me that my bear cans were too close to camp and showed me where to put them. I asked why in the SNP all the bear poles were so close. From what he said it sounds like the idea is to keep everything close together at park campsites. Most of the shelters are used to capacity and the quantity of people deters the bears. If the bears are brave enough to try for the poles, they want people to hear the bears and to be able to scare off the bears. Where we are now, there aren’t enough people, so they don’t want the bears attracted to the people.","Harpers Creek Shelter

Today was pretty uneventful day. We left the shelter late, 9 am. We knew there was a 5.5 mile dry section so we drank lots of water at breakfast. We started out and the trail had lots of gravel on it. I slid and really tore up my leg. Not a great start to the day.
Half way through the day we got to Spy Rock. It is a huge boulder that you can climb for a 360 view of the area. We climbed up the rock and spent some time.
We then continued on our way and had lunch at Porter Gap. The water was a bit of a haul as it was down hill from the stealth sites. We spent a nice hour in the shade, eating lunch and enjoying the forest.
We met the sisters at Seeley Wordsworth Shelter. We continued on 2 more miles to the campsite at the North Fork of the Piney River. We camped with their group and had a great time. It is nice to be traveling in the same direction as others in which you have interests in common.","Priest Shelter

We were up and out of camp by 8 am today. We had a 13 mile day planned, so we were hoping for some cooler weather. It wasn’t any cooler though. We had 3 - 500ft climbs and a 2500 ft descent. The Tar Jacket Ridge didn’t have a great view, but Cole Mountain was a “Bald”, a grassy top. The scene was spectacular. Pop took pictures. We walked in the sun for a mile before heading back into the tree cover. Oddly enough Bald Knob wasn’t a “Bald” mountain and had no view.
We had lunch under a large tree at the turn off for the trail to the water source. We ate lunch with the sisters and one of them let me use her phone to contact Michael. She is such a wonderful woman. I was able to coordinate with Michael on getting a new battery. She and her sister have been great company. When we left we shared contact info.
The descent down Bald Knob was a knee and toe jammer. We met some hikers trying to climb the mountain and struggling with the temperatures. By the time we reached US 60, we were thinking about heading to town. The last few days heat had made us feel sick and energy-less. However, we had no cell signal nor was there any traffic going toward town. We began the two mile walk to the shelter, but it was 7:30 pm. We hiked quickly until dark. We gave up looking for the shelter, so when we found a really wonderful looking camping area we stopped. We set up and cooked dinner in the dark. It was cool and peaceful. 
In the morning we found that we were at the shelter tent sites, but we couldn’t see the shelter in the dark.","North Fork Piney River Stealth Site

We made the 5 miles around the Lynchburg Reservoir quickly and arrived at the Reservoir road. We sat under a tree and tried to cool down. A section hiker parking for his trip gave us a baggie of ice each. So we reclined under the tree with the ice on our chests until it melted. We got going around 3 pm to climb the 1000ft Rice Mountain. Pop had a mini -breakdown half way up.  It was just too hot. We got water, cooled off and continued up the last 500 ft. We had another mile and 500 feet up to go in order to get to the road, but neither of us had much left to offer the trail. We found a nice stealth site and stayed there, a mile from the road.

By 1:30 we had completed a 1700 ft climb and 6 miles of trail. Lunch was deviled ham and crackers at an Overlook with a great view to the east and the James River.
After lunch we had an easy walk for a few miles. We met Katz on the trail. He was the man who drove the shuttle in Waynesboro and helped us. He was hiking North. It was nice to see a familiar face.
The hike down Bluff Mountain was steep and after 3 miles our feet hurt. We reached the shelter and set up the tent and had dinner. Another hiker arrived and asked if we had any power to let him charge his phone a bit so he could call his ride. We traded a 20% phone charge for a small can of gas. True bartering.

We began our 2000ft ascent. It really wasn’t bad at all even though it looked very steep on the map. I was listening to my book and Jessica to her music. Jessica was having a hard time though. I wasn’t sure what was wrong and she finally admitted that it was “leaving town blues”. She was also upset that because she had asked for extra town days, we may not make our goal of Damascus. I told her not to worry and we will just go as far as we can. After our conversation, she started doing much better.

Most of the morning’s views were the Stinging Nettle covered understory of the forest. There are lots of deciduous trees dropping nuts on us. I’m going to have to look us what kind they are. I started noticing that my chest hurts on the right side. Actually, exactly under where my sternum strap connects to my shoulder strap. I think I probably bruised my sternum and rib when I fell. I just didn’t notice it until my face stopped hurting.
After the shelter we climbed 400 feet and began the several thousand foot descent. Byyhe time we got to the Bryant Ridge Shelter, I couldn’t use my right pole anymore due to the pain. Two Aleve helped with that. We passed the Guillotine today. It is a rock formation where you have to walk under a rock wedged between two granite walls. Pop ran through, not wanting it to drop on her!
We accidentally found another dinner that is really good. 1 beef ramen pack, 1 chicken ramen pack, and 4 eggs( dehydrated and reconstituted). When cooked together it makes a noodle casserole type dish that was really good. Of course not in the civilized world, but in the woods heck yea!

As we walked around the edge of the rise we saw a bear digging in the soil for food. We stood quietly and watched it for a minute. When it saw us, it turned around and ran away into the brush. It was a very cool moment to share with Jessica. We succeeded and made it to our goal by 7 pm. We felt great! This shelter is also very nice and clean with a good privy.

We went about 0.1 to Lambert Shelter to use the privy. Another bear trapped her in the privy for about 10 minutes. Not really trapped, but it was eating berries in front of the privy while she was in there. It didn’t decide to leave for 10 minutes.
We began the climb to Tinker Cliffs. A very straight forward 1000 ft climb. The view from the cliffs was incredible! It was a beautiful day and very clear. The cliffs themselves were also interesting. Giant sandstone columns of rocks with large gaps between made up the cliff face.

We took some pictures and then went over to a spot further away from the edge and looked at the view. We had learned that a man had fallen the day before and we had been perplexed as to how that happened. The ledge looks scary, but when you walk out into it, it is easy to stay away from the edge. However, we saw no less than 4 people who could have died just then. People doing handstands and cartwheels on the edge. Kids running around and not being careful. I had to leave because I started getting very anxious and panicky watching the people.On the way down we met the McAfee Knob Task Force voulenteer. He hiked up and down the trail making sure people have enough water and are prepared for the hike. It is an 8 mi round trip hike and many day hikers are not prepared enough. They often run out of water, run out of snacks, or take too long and get stuck in the dark. We had filled up with 4L of water each at Campbell Shelter so we were fine.

Dragon’s Tooth was impressive. There were other visitors there as well. It is a large granite formation shaped like a jagged tooth. It is surrounded by other granite cliffs. We began our descent and that is when the real challenge started. The trail is a series of boulders and rock faces that you need to climb down. This area reminds me of the Kinsman area of the White Mountains. We have to be very careful on the rocks. So many people have traveled the trail that the stone is polished like a gem, thus slick and treacherous. We descended about 700 vertical feet in a half mile like this.

There are signs all over saying “Don’t touch or feed the ponies.” So what do they do? I saw a group where the Dad told his kids to go pet the foals. Guess what the Mom ponies did. Tried to head butt the kids. When that didn’t work, the stallion charged the group. Smart. We got back to the car and drove back to Pearisburg. We stayed at the Angel’s Rest Hiker Haven again. This time we camped out on the lawn. It is half the price and you still get the same amenities.","Grayson Highlands

When we woke up this morning, the water I collected from the spring puddle had settled and was clear. I started the water filter and began breakfast while Pop packed up the tent.   We started downhill and walked 3.6 miles to Warspur Shelter. We ate lunch and decided to stay here today. There was plenty of water and it is beautiful here. I spend time journaling. Pop makes a business plan for her art work.","Campsite on Sinking Creek Branch
