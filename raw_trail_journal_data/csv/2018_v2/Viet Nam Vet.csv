Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587576,"4/18/18 I arrived on Amtrak train 7 AM in Gainesville Georgia. My shuttle driver Ron Brown pick me up along with 2 other AT hikers and dropped us off at Appalachian trail and the forest service road. We arrived at the location at 10:30 AM. I along with the other two hikers one from New Jersey the other one New York walked 9/10 of a mile southbound on the Appalachian trail to the starting point on Springer mountain. The start of the first white Blaze on the trail and a plaque naming the trail. We took pictures at the starting point and signed in on the logbook. After signing the logbook we started our hike. I stopped at Stover Creek shelter to take a half hour snack break and rest. There I met Baba. I also met a retired Carpenter from Indiana. We all talked and eventually got back on the trail. I was very tired but motivated to make it to the Hawk Mountain shelter. On the way I took several breaks took multiple breaks for snacks and rest and to replenish water. The last 4 miles was climbing up and over Hawk Mountain to the shelter. The climb was long and brutal especially since I had not gotten any sleep on the train. I ran into a guy named Frank he and his girlfriend are here on a six-month Visa from Germany so they can hike the Appalachian Trail. They are At the shelter (but camping) we had a great time talking with them. I claimed my spot in the shelter. When I got here only one person was in the shelter. Everyone else had set up tents in the tenting area. After getting setup in the shelter, I cooked dinner which consisted of Ramen with mixed beans chili and I had a muscle milk drink. I put beef jerky in ramen as well. Dinner was great. Everyone was cooking at about the same time and having multiple conversations. After dinner I talked to two guys that were in the Marine Corps we had a great conversation. Everyone gathered around the fire to watch hiker TV and talk. Again it’s a beautiful night, bright stars and no wind and the temperature is about 60°. Well my body is tired from lack of sleep and walking almost 9 miles with my 24 pound pack. I did not get much sleep due to several people on the train had their electronics working fast and furious with the volume way up and everyone having conversations and looking at their devices videos on YouTube etc., . I finally got about two hours of sleep on the train. I believe that had a big impact on me on the trail. I felt fatigued I reach the nearly 1500 ft climb up Hawk Mountain. When I was climbing up the mountain,  I kept thinking “Keep  Pounding”. Keep pounding is the mantra of the Tennessee Titans because of there former linebacker number 51 Sam Mills. Sam Mills is also a former defense coach for the Titans. He worked that job until his death from cancer. Sam Mills has a son that is a coach on the staff even though his son never played professional football. So it’s theme and mantra for my hike will be the words “Keep Pounding “ during my hike today, I wanted to stop walking multiple times but i kept saying to myself “keep pounding”. And that got me up at over Hawk Mountain. It Motivated me to continue walking. Everyone here is sitting around the fire talking and watching Hiker tv. When I finish his post entry,  I’m turning in for the night. I’m exhausted. SEMPER FI. Viet Nam Vet","Springer Mountain

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587577,"4/19/18 hiked 8.5 miles to Gooch Mountain Shelter. I broke camp at 8:00 AM heading northbound to Gooch Mountain Shelter. The weather was 34 degrees with 25 to 35 mile winds out of the northwest. As I walked the trail, the trees were swaying pretty good and the hangup trees were creaking loudly making weird sound like animals. I was constantly looking up for any danger of the creaking trees falling. As I was defending the mountain into Hightower Gap, the winds really picked. Just before arriving at Horse gap, two trees fell. They were huge and made a loud crashing noise as if two tractor trailers collided. Whoever said trees don’t make a sound when they fall in the forest was wrong lol. I was lucky the fallen trees did not fall across the trail and they were huge dead trees. Now that made your heart pumping a little faster. I started my ascent/cling up out of Horse Gap up Sassafras mountain. A 1,000 foot climb within a one mile span ( a pure unadulterated butt kicker). Once at the top of Sassafras I was tire and took a 20 minuet snack break to get ready for my decent off the mountain and start of my next climb up Justus Mountain. After descending into Cooper Gap at Forest Service Road 15, I stopped at the campsite there and talked with the family that was camping there. I met their two dos “Radar” and “Sammie” really loved play fetch with them. After a half hour, I left and bagan my climb up Justus Mountain which was a lot easier than Sassafras mountain. Justus Mountain was only about 600 ft in elevation. I continued hiking to the Justus Creek Camping Area where I stopped to replenish my water supply. There was no other water source from Hawk Mountain Shelter to the Justus Creek ( I knew this before leaving Hawk mountain). So it was vital to either take extra water with you or be without.  Shortly after arriving at the Creek, the family I met earlier stopped at the creek as well. I played with the dogs for few minutes before making the final three mile hike to the shelter. I was glad I took an extra half liter of water with me from the creek because I was drinking it fast due to being exposed in the sun for over two hours climbing up and down the mountains. About a mile from the shelter, I stopped to observe and take a picture of a  beautiful looking bird that I did know the name for. While doing that, two brothers from Israelí stopped and we talked a few minutes about the gorgeous bird. Once in camp at Gooch Mountain Shelter, I was tired and exhausted so I immediately claimed a spot in the shelter, got out my air mattress and sleeping bag. Once the mattress was full of air I got into my sleeping bag and took a one hour nap. After my nap I cooked dinner and sat around talking with the other hikers on a range of subjects dealing with the Appalachian trail an their story as to why they chose the AT. I had a great conversation with two former Marines on our life’s In the Corps. As the sun drops, the field mice are running around under the shelter . It won’t be long before they make their way into the shelter an start nibbling on our gear looking for food. Well, everyone is turning in for the night so I too sissy the same. Good night. “Keep Pounding “ Viet Nam Vet","Hawk mountain shelter

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587580,"4/20/18 I hiked 8.9 miles today from Gooch Mountain Shelter to the primitive campsite at Dockery Lake Trail At the Appalachian Trail. I broke camp at 8:20 and started the climb (500 ft) out of the valley to the top and walked the ridge line for about 2 miles before descending into Gooch Gap At the Forest Service Road 42. I took a break here before making the one mile steady gradual climb to Liss Gap. During my snack break at the forest service road, I chatted with some weekend campers (husband, wife, and two kids). We chatted for about 20 minuets before I had to get back on trail. I asked them if they always camp here during the week and they looked at me sort of strange. The little kid asked me if I knew way Day it was and I replied “yes it Thursday “. They all started laughing. So I asked what was so funny and in unison they replied “ it Saturday”.  I couldn’t do nothing but laugh with them. I had not remembered to keep tracks of the day of the week. After leaving them, I made the climb up and over the mountain to Liss Gap and took a breat of 15 minuets. During my break several other thru-hikers stopped and we talked and ate snacks before moving on to take on the tough climb up “Ramrock Mountain”. It was a beast of a climb (not much in elevation but steep and rocky). After the decent of Ramrock Mountain the trail somewhat leveled off for about 1-1/2 miles with some rock areas. The trail led right into Woody Gap National Recreation Area. It was the perfect spot for a lunch break. I arrived ahead of the crowd by about 15 minuets. So I was able to stretch out on one of the concrete picnic tables and got a power nap before lunch.  I woke up to see there were at least 25 hikers at the site, all of whom I’ve been hiking with over the past several days. Tow of them were on the midnight train to GA with me ( we talked on the train ride). They were coming from New Jersey. Just as I will pack up to leave a older lady who dropped her husband off there to hike asked if he was going in the right direction to get to Neels gap. I told her yes and then I asked her how heavy is his pack. She responded five 3049 and she thought that was way too heavy. I agree with her on that. She stated she would be picking him up at Neel’s Gap to resupply Him. She stated she would be his support vehicle and will follow him to Maine. I told her when he gets to Neel Gap, he should have the staff people do a shake down on his back. She agreed that’s what she was going to have him do. She then got in her vehicle and we parted ways. I began the 1.3 mile 1,000 ft climb up Cedar Mountain. I stopped at the “Preaching Rock” View point st about 500 ft up. The view was spectacular and well worth the climb. I stopped here and took a 20 minute power nap along with two other hikers (both US MARINE’S who served in Afghanistan together and was doing this hike for a fallen Marine friend). The had a teddy bear made from the uniform he was wearing the day of his death. The took pictures of the teddy bear facing the view of the valley and mountains in the distance. It was a very moving moment. I went on to finish the climb to the top of Big Cedar Mountain. The views were simply spectacular. I wish all of you reading this journal could be hear to witness it for yourself. I continued my decent (which was a 2 mile decent) until I reached my campsite at Dockery Lake Trail and the AT. All the other hikers passed up staying at this primitive campsite so the could stay at the Lance Creek Camping Area. I didn’t want to camp there because I knew it would be over crowded and you won’t get much sleep there (I won’t mention why lol). I got a hire going after I set up my tent. Well, four other hikers decided to stay where I’m staying (a father and his son and grandson, a weekend Hiker just out for 2 days, and a elderly thrust hiker). We all ate dinner at the same time sitting around the fire talking and watching Hiker tv. We had a good time talking and now we are all in our tents. It’s time to say good night.

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587582,"4/21/18 hiked 7.8 miles. Got up at 7:00 am made breakfast of cream of whet and beef jerky. While cooking and eating I was also packing up my gear. I left camp later than normal at 8:35 am. I was just plain old slow about packing up. I chatted with the other campers for awhile before finally leaving. The hike started out pretty good with great weather and plenty of sunshine. The temperature was about 45 degrees with a slight wind. Within 3/4 of a mile I hit my first clim of the day which ended up being an all day steady climb from what it seemed like to me. The climb stretched over a 5.5 mile stretch and went from 2,800 ft in elevation to 4,457 ft in elevation. Yes it was brutal pure unadulterated brutality on the feet and legs. But I continued to remember the words of Tennessee Titans player and later turned coach #51 San Mills (KEEP POUNDING “). Every time I thought of stopping, I just repeated to myself “KEEP POUNDING “. The climb took me thru several Gaps like Henry Gap, Jarrard Gap, and Turkey Stamp. Along the way I met many new hikers some with dogs (I got to play with some of them and some I would just sit on the ground next to them and talk and rub them). The dogs were of all breeds and realty Ike my interactions with them. During the climb I met and talked with several people about everything under the sun (except politics and religion). No one out here wants to talk about or be associated with either of those two subjects. The minute someone tries to bring it up in conversation, they are told to switch subject or leave. It’s an unwritten rule that we just don’t want to here about either subject. Before reacting the start of the climb for Blood Mountain, I ran into “Box Car Willie” who was taking a break on a downed oak tree. I stopped and said “wow, I didn’t think I would catch up to you since yesterday “. He is the Hiker I mentioned in my post yesterday (4/20/18) who I met at Woody Gap and he was carrying a 49 lbs pack. I met and spoke with his wife then. They have a camper and she will be his support all the way to Maine. After Box Car Willie finished his break, he headed up the trail. I finished my snack break about 5-10 minuets later and headed up the trail. After a few minutes I saw Box Car Willie coming back towards me Walking southbound. I asked if head lost anything and he said no. He said I went in the wrong direction I was on the Blue Blazed Trail. I looked at him in amazement and ask “what do you mean you’re on the Blue trail” he replied there are two blue blazes on the tree in this trail. I got to thinking oh no we didn’t miss any AT turn offs but let me check my data book and my Guthook app to be sure. Before checking those things, I told him we’re on the right path to climb Blood Mountain. After checking my source, I showed him that we were still on the AT. He said ok but what was the Blue Blazes for. I explained to him that those were the trail marking that would lead a hiker to the shelter call Wood Hole Shelter. You could see the relief on his face how glad he was that he hadn’t gone any further past me. I told him we’re going to have to change your trailname from Box Car Willie to “Wrong Way” and he got a good laugh out of that. Well, I hiked with him until we got to the stone steps that start the climb up Blood Mountain. Shortly into the climb I pulled further ahead of him. That 49 lbs pack was making him stop about every 1/10th of a mile. I made it to the top of Blood Mountain where I relaxed for about a 1/2 hour talking with different people who were out for a day hike on the mountain. I saw the local trail club’s Ridge Runner and we spoke then we remembered each other from last year on Trey Mountain at the Trey Mountain Shelter. We Laughting and talked about how brutally cold it was that night on the mountain. After a few minutes I headed down the trail off the mountain. The views up there were spectacular. The decent off the mountain was as brutal as the climb going up. The slick bald slabs of rocks, the boulders and the rocky trail with sections of rock steps made it hard on the knees and feet. I made it off the mountain and to Neels Gap at 4:30 pm. I went into the hostel/Outfitter store named “Mountain Crossing “. There I ate a whole pizza with a 20oz Coke and large cheese danish sweet bun. Later I saw Box Car Willie wife drive into the parking lot. She waved and asked if I’d seen her husband. I told her yes and he was ok and that he’s probably about a half hour behind me. I told her where he wold be coming off the trail to get here and that she Soulflute be able to see him as he comes off the trail. We chatted a lil longer and then saw him coming down the trail (I didn’t tell her if his mush so as not to worry her). He has some depth perception issues. I went and joined the other hiker and had a beer and just talked about our day on the AT. I was a good day overall.

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587735,"4/22/18 I woke up at 7 AM pack my pack and check out at Mountains crossings hostile. The weather was moving in quickly. The clouds in the sky we’re getting darker and the winds were picking up and the temperature was dropping. I asked about staying and additional day, the staff person told me they only allow one day stay at the hostel. I checked my data book and called blood mountain cabins to make a reservation for a nights stay considering The severe impending weather front coming in my direction. No one answered the phone at blood mountain cabins so I left a message. Based on their recording, the office did not open until 9:00 AM. Therefore I decided to walk to the cabin which is only 3/10 of a mile from Mountain Crossing. As I started down the road another hiker caught up to me who was going in the same direction. We got to the blood mountain cabins together and went into the office and I checked in. I was somewhat surprised that there were as many cabins down in that holler then you can see from the road. The office also serves as a miniature restaurant with lounge area and store provisions. Of course, everything cost. After checking in I ran into Patrick and Redd the two former US Marines Afghanistan vets walking the trail in honor and memory of one of their fallen buddies. We chatted a minute and I moved on to my cabin. I was assigned to the Fox cabin. I really like the set up at the check-in office. And, I was pleasantly surprised at the size and layout of the cabin I was given. The cabin has one bedroom on the entrance level where the kitchen bathroom dining/living room with the fireplace. There is a set of stairs that go up to the loft where there is a full-size bed. The cabin has cathedral wood ceilings with wood paneling walls. The flooring has carpet Burberry type carpet. The fireplace is really nice. I started a far in it about an hour after getting into The cabin. The fireplace has two small mantle’s and there are three different breeds of taxidermy foxes, a winter white fur box, a red fox, and a gray fox. It is a nice comfortable cabin. I like it and the layout. Well I took a nap for about two hours. I got up after my nap and I called the shuttle driver by the name of Spliter ( like log splitter) and he shuttled me to Blairsville because he had to hikers going that way. I went in to the IGA supermarket and bought some bacon eggs and grits along with a package of chicken wings to cook for dinner today and tomorrow. I cook dinner, chicken wings, macaroni and cheese (in the microwaveable cups) and some knors dirty rice and I had a Coca-Cola for my drink. I watch the news as I ate checking on the weather and it didn’t look good for Monday. With that said, I will be hunkered down another day. I bought a five dollar bag of wood to burn in the fireplace. So, I had a nice fire going in the fireplace. I washed my clothes after eating dinner. I relaxed on the futon couch watching tv. I burned the last log at about 8 PM and it went out before I went to bed. It was a good relaxing day and I got a good meal. Time to go to bed “KEEP POUNDING “ Viet Nam Vet","Neels Gap

Last night the weather was horrendous and the winds were howling very fiercely. The rain was coming down in buckets. Yesterday would not have been a good day to be hiking. Walked up to the rental office and posted pictures on Facebook and talk with some of the other hikers. I had another cup of coffee while I sat in the lounge area. I talked with the German couple for a while. I went back to my cabin and sorted through my gear made sure I had everything I needed for my departure on Tuesday. I had lunch, which consisted of summer sausage on tortilla bread. I had a bag of Chito‘s for desert. At about 1 o’clock I took a two-hour nap. I got up feeling well rested from my nap. Well, nothing much happening today other than the rain and lots of it. I made dinner while watching tv and afterwards just relaxed until bedtime. I called the shuttle guy Spliter to pick me up at 7:00 am tomorrow morning. After that I showered and made last minute checks to make sure I had everything for the next morning.

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587915,"4/24/18 Again, no hiking today due to the severe weather conditions. Woke up at 5:30 AM and started prepping to get out of here to hit the trail. As I slowly moved about in my morning stupor, the sound of the babbling brook behind my cabin seemed to be roaring pretty loud. I pulled open the curtains and was flabbergasted at what I saw. The rain was coming down in buckets and it was wind driven. At that point I called Spliter and called off the shuttle. Spliter was ok with that because he too saw how bad it was out there. After talking with Spliter, I made coffee and breakfast and called it a day. About 9:00 am i walked up to the office to let them know I would be staying another day, and nearly got soaked from the short walk. The rain was cold and steady. At about 12:30PM the rain stopped but the were still omnibus signs in the sky of more rain to come. I ate lunch in the lounge area of the rental office at about 1:00 PM (meat lovers pizza & coke cola). I met Strong Hammer whos from Charlotte, NC. We talked about the trail and shared stories of our own adventures in the 100 mile wilderness of Maine (he was there in 2012 and mine in 2017). While I ate and he waited for his pizza. The weather eventually cleared up with some rain clouds still lingering in the area. Im glad I sat the day out. The temperatures are a little cool to chilly. So, I know if I had set out into the rain this morning I would be wet and cold right about now. So I think I made the right decisions to hunker down today. I went back up to the lounge area at the rental office and talked with Nitsy  and his wife, they are both doing the trail for the first time. During our conversation another burst of rain showers began and lasted about an hour. While at the rental office (which is where the WiFi is stronger), I contacted RE in Asheville, NC (thanks Ray for the contact number there). I told the rep my situation and wanted to know the best course of actions or options available. REI rep stated  they would ship me new shoes but couldnt guarantee it would be within three to five days (they would send them regular 1st class mail). REI also wanted me to pay (over the phone) for a replacement pair at a cost of $120 of which they would credit back to me once they received the defective pair I was wearing in return mail. Before all of that, the REI rep says to me send us the defective shoes and once we receive them, we will mail you a replacement pair at no cost (but I had to pay shipping cost to send them the defective pair). Crazy, I thought to myself. I kindly reminded her that I couldnt send the pair I was wearing because they were all I had. I also reminded her as to where I was located. After that conversation, I called NorthFace warranty department (thank you so very much my friend Monica J.W. for IMing me the number). I told the rep my situation and she stated they would overnight me a new pair. The NorthFace rep asked what color would I like and I told her to just send any color purple haze, red, fusia, pink, yellow whatever you got, I just need the shoes. Well, she got a Laughting out of that one. She asked for the location to have the shoes sent to and my email address. I gave her that information and she replied youre all set and should receive the shoes by Thursday 4/26/18. The rep then asked if there was anything else she could help with. I replied thats all and she thanked me for my call and I thanked her for her great professionalism and service. After ending the call, my feet did a happy dance LOL LOL LOL oh happy days my feet were singing . Its 9:00pm and i just checked off everything in preparation for my early morning departure from here and back to the trail. It is now past hiker midnight so good night to all.

Woke up this morning made my breakfast had a phone conversation with a great friend. My shuttle driver Spliter showed up on time at 8:30. Drop me off at hog pen gap and I hit the trail from that point on. I had one moderate cLimb over Sheep Rock Top. After that, the terrain was pretty unforgiving with no major climbs until later into the hike. I went through cold springs Gap, Chattahoochee gap and red clay gap before hitting the climb up Blue Mountain. I stopped at the blue mountain shelter  for a snack and pushed onward. I made the steep decent off Blue Mountain into Unicoi Gat. I took a short break here in preparation for the long climb to the top of Rocky Mountain.(a 1200 ft climb within a one mile stretch). It was a brutal climb near the end of a long day. The decent was hard on the knees. As I defended into Trey Gap, I could smell food cooking on a grill. Once in the gap, a 2015 thru hiker had set up his grill and coolers to provide trail Majic to the hikers. Wow what an awesome sight for sore eyes and a growling belly.  Well, I Made myself at home and had two burgers, two kiddy Fruit drinks, hostess cup cake and two bananas. I hung around for about thirty minutes before facing the reality of the unfortunate brutal climb lying in wait. The brutal heartbreaking climb and it was Trey Mountain (1600 ft climb over a two mile stretch). Trey Mountain was my nemesis from last year”s thru hike when I hiked with Purple Pony. A shout out to Purple Pony “ nothing has changed with that Mountain and it’s brutally “. The climb seemed to never end switchback after switchback, steep climb after steep climb, and false summit after false summit. The climb even took a toll on the younger hikers too. Finally at the summit, the view was limited but awesome. I took pictures of the view and the survey markers.  I had a snack and chatted with the other hikers who were just arriving at the summit. After a short while, I started my decent of a half mile to the Trey Mountain Shelter. I made it to the shelter and was the only person there until about twenty other hikers showed up. By then I had already claimed my spot in the shelter. I took a short half hour nap. I woke up and made my dinner. I ate and hung my food bag on the Bear cable system and started writing my journal for today. Well it’s past hiker midnight and I am am exhausted.

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588207,"4/26/18 hiked 8 miles. Woke up at 7 AM made breakfast and packed my gear. I hit the trail at 7:45AM. I knew there was an impending storm coming at an Noon, so I wanted to knock down as many miles as possible before the rain came. I came off the mountain into Wolfpen Gap and continued the decent into Steeltrap Gap. Things weee going good and then I had a flashback to March 17, 2017. I realized that the climbing would start after I climed and descended Young Lick Knob and down into the The Swag Of The Blue.  The Swag is a depression between the two mountains (not a Gap). I knew I had to climb Sassafras ( which is always brutal). I made the one mile switchbacks climb and decent into Sassafras Gap. It was a long steady arduous climb. I was just hoping the rain would hold off. I could see the omnibus rain clouds looming in the background and slowly creeping up on me. I made another climb up Sassafras (yes there are two of the humps right next to each other). I then decended into Addis Gap were I took a half hour break and loaded up on food before the more than a half mile climb in less than a half mile. Well the light to medium rain started while making the climb. Things got slick and slippery. My main goal was to stay upright. That baby was steep and never ending and zapped me of my strength by the time I reached the summit of Kelty Knob. I took a snack break at the top. The  one mile decent was as brutal on the knees as the ascent was on the calves and thighs. I finally was off that monster of a mountain and within a half mile, I hit the turnoff for the Shelter. Had it not been raining I would have continued on to Dicks Creek and stayed at the Hostel “Top of GA”. But It was raining a little to hard. As I walked the blue blazed trail to Deep Creek Shelter, I kept thinking we’re the hell is the Shelter? Well it is 3/10 of a mile from the cutoff trail. Once at the shelter, I asked the other hikers “ Was that a cruel joke they played on us with that kind of hike to this shelter “. They all agreed it was senseless. I claimed me a spot in the half empty shelter. After setting up my bedding, I took a two hour nap. I was exhausted from the steep climb and decent of Kelty Knob. When I awaken from my nap, the Shelter was full to capacity (Upper and lower level). The rain stopped and I went to fetch water to cook. I made dinner and began writing this journal page (I won’t be able to post it until tomorrow the 28th when I’m at the hostel due to lack of WiFi and cell service).

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588230,"4/27/18 hiked 6 miles to Dicks Creek Gap . Woke up to a foggy misty morning. The air was chilly and damp. It was a bone chilling dampness that you just couldn’t shake off. I made breakfast and packed up. After saying good bye to everyone, I started my ascent on the blue blaze trail to connect with the Appalachian Trail. One I reached the AT trail junction, I turned left and began another ascent. After a half mile of ascent, I noticed an odd looking fell tree formation. For a moment I starred at the odd formation and thought to my self”I’ve seen this before “. I started to push on up the mountain but I couldn’t stop staring at the tree and then it hit me like a ton of bricks dropping from a tall red oak tree. Immediately I started cussing myself out and yelling into the dense almost impenetrable fog. I dropped my pack to the ground and sat on it thinking “dumbass” you’ve gone a half mile uphill in the wrong direction. Now the rain has started again as I sat on my pack thinking what the hell was i thinking when I reached the trail junction? Well, I figured it out “I wasn’t thinking”. I can’t blame it on the foggy weather. I can only blame it on my foggy mind. I checked my GutHook App and as suspected, I had gone a half mile in the wrong direction (southbound instead of northbound). I just sat there for about 10 minuets before putting my pack on and heading down the mountain in the right direction. As I passed the shelter cutoff trail, other hikers were entering onto the AT. One of the hikers said you been waiting here? I said no but don’t ask and went on to tell him I went in the wrong direction. He said it happened to him at the Blue Mountain Shelter. I didn’t feel any better but oh well suck it up and move on. As I descended the mountain the chill in the air didn’t subside and the fog just kept rolling in with a slight to moderate breeze. The misty rain fall continued. At about 11:00 the sun started to break through the fog and the misty rain stopped. I thought oh what a relief now that the sun is coming out. I stopped at the water source at the creek at about one mile from Dicks Creek Gap and had a snack and water. Another hiker that was at the shelter with me (Mike) stopped to change into dry clothes and a quick wash up in the creek(of course downstream of where hikers get their water). While taking my break, a southbound thru hiker stopped and chatted with me. He was 78 years old and doing the trail a second time like me. The hikers trail name is “Slow Motion”. We had a good conversation before we parted ways. I made it to Dicks Creek Gap and saw other hikers from the shelter. And, there was trail Majic at the picnic table. A box filled with 24 oz Gatorade of different flavors, oranges, a variety of sodas and several king size snickers candy bars. I grabbed an orange, a Gatorade and a candy bar. I think I finished all in about five minutes or less. It was a welcomed treat. The shuttle I called when I reached the gap arrived about twenty minutes later to take me to Hiawassee to the budget Inn and from there I walked the one mile to the post office. I got my new NorthFace shoes and another package. I took off the shoes I was wearing and put the in the box my new shoes came in and sealed the box with the return shipping label. I shipped the old pair off and got my receipt and walked to the budget Inn. I got me a room there for the night. I might stay an extra day to see the Bass Fishing Tournament on Lake Wachuetus here in Hiawassee.  I took a nap from 2:30 until 4:00 PM. After my nap I walked to Dairy Queen and sat inside and ate. About 5:00 I got a call from “Boston “ and “Reds” saying they were leaving the post office but had no were to stay. So I told them where I was and to come on down. They arrived a half hour later with their resupply boxes. We all went to the burger joint called Berney”s and ate and had a beer. Back at the room they separated out their food supplies while we watched the Calvliers and Pacers game. After that they passed out. I’m going to da the same because it’s past hiker midnight.

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588334,"4/28/18 Zero day today/ no hiking. All I did today was relax and bonded with the other hikers I’ve been hiking with for the past ten days. Making sure I ate good and got in my vegetable. I want to go to the lake and watch the bass fishing tournament but it was over soon than I thought. I talked with a few of them when they returned to the Inn. They were a little disappointed because the wind came in early and it made for a bad day of fishing on the lake. One fisherman said he caught two but they were not tournament size and the wind just got to be too much. It was a beautiful day on land with warm temperatures, sunshine with a slight wind out of the West. Reds, Boston and I went to an all you can eat buffet and ate well. Afterward we had a beer or two and packed up our packs for tomorrow’s hike. Boston will be getting off trail and going home to Colorado tomorrow for personal reasons. Reds will continue his memorial hike carrying the teddy bear in honor of his fallen friend who wanted to do the hike. Well it’s past hiker midnight so good night. “KEEP POUNDING” as the late Sam Mills of the Tennessee Titans would say. Viet Nam Vet","N/A

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588520,"4/29/18 hiked 13 miles. Woke up And had breakfast. Hit the trail at 9:15 AM. The day was long and brutal. Up and over one mountain after another. They were steep climbs with no level areas. They were 500 and 800 foot climbs with no breaks before starting the next climb. The hardest part of the day was making the last five miles from Plumorchard Shelter arar to Bly Gap just north of the GA/NC Border. The climb went from 3,000 to 5,000 foot of ascent, after you went up and over Blue Ridge Gap. I was completely exhausted by the time I reached Bly Gap. I was down to less than a cup of water when I arrived at the campsite. I was to tired to write this post yesterday so I’m writing it today April 30th. I can only say the day was brutal and unrelenting. But, i kept pounding. I arrived in camp at 6:30 pm and had enough light to set up my tent and cook dinner.

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588750,"4/30/18 hiked 4 miles. Woke up at 9:00AM and made breakfast and hit the trail. I’m feeling beat up from yesterday’s hike and starting to feel something going on with my sinus. I decided to do a short to day to recoup a little more before getting back at it full throttle. The climb out of Bly Gap was brutal and straight up then down and back up again. Then had to go up and over Sassafras and another climb to get to the shelter. I made it to the shelter and took a nap. I woke up at 3:30 and several other hikers had arrived and were setting up their tents. The rest of the day was uneventful. I met FedEx, ZIP Lock, Four-Step. I decided it was too late to make the five mile hike to Standing Indian Shelter. Additionally, I’m not feeling to good and my strength seems to be zapped by this constant caught and nasal drip. I’ve been hiking with it for the past week. When I get to Franklin, NC I’ll go to the Urgent Care Clinic and get it checked out. Oh well there is nothing I can do about it until I reach Deep Gap or Winding Stair Gap tomorrow. There, I will call a shuttle to get me into Franklin. Not sure if I’ll be staying at Baltimore Jacks Hostel or Gooder Grove Hostel. I’ve stayed at Gooder Grove last year in late March. Oh well, I decide when I get to that bridge crossing. Right now it’s past hiker midnight. “KEEP POUNDING “. Viet Nam Vet”","Bly Gap camp area

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588901,"5/1/18 hiked 16.7 miles. Woke up not feeling well, I coughed all thru the night along with blowing my nose. I was coughing up phlegm from my chest and blowing out the same from my sinus. To me it was official that I had a sinus infection when the coloring of the phlegm was greenish. Ok, enough of the gory details on that. It’s been zapping my strength for the last few days. I ate breakfast and broke camp heading to Deep Gap. I was thinking I would call for a shuttle at Deep Gap to get into Franklin, NC. When I got to Deep Gap, I made a call or two and no shuttle would come that far out to pick up a hiker. Oh well I know now that I don’t have an option but to make it to the USFS RD 83 at Mooney Gap or camp here at Deep Gap and set out the next morning for the Forest Service Road At Mooney Gap. Well I decided to push on. Along the way I passed the “The Chunky Gal” trail and had to take a selfie as I had done the year before. I stopped at Standing Indian Shelter for a snack but still wasn’t feeling well but not bad. I didn’t have a big appetite. Not having an appetite out here is not good. I’m starting to question my decision at this point if I should have gotten off trail back at the US Forest Service Road 71 At Deep Gap. But i felt ok at the time and thought i had another 5 to 7 miles left in the old tank. I’m feeling a little better as I finish up on eating my snack of beef jerky and peanut butter in a tortilla wrap. And, a “GU” gel pack. The GU gel packs are what’s been giving me the energy for the climbs ( there sold REI). I had 16 oz drink of electrolyte to wash it all down. After the snack, i replenish my electrolytes drink and had a GU energy gel pack to get through the next few miles. I got to moving again and the trail was pretty unforgiving and down hill for about five miles before another climb (a short incline of a mile). I knew after that climb it would be down hill all the way to a Forest Service Road 83. Well it took all I had to make the last 6 miles. I made it pass carter Gap Shelter and started the decent down to Betty Creek Gap. While at altitude and having a cell signal, I called Baltimore Jacks and asked for a shuttle. They told me it would be about 2 hours. I called “Zen” at Gooder Grove Hostel for a shuttle but had to leave a message. At this time I’m really doubting my decision to push on that extra six miles because now I’m possibly stuck there at the FSR 83 . As I approached the parking area, I see a silver colored Ford Explorer. The driver and another person (female hiker) talking to a hiker that I was following ever since the last Shelter. Once I got to the lot and sat on the tree log, I started to realize I knew the driver of the Ford. I called out his name “Zen” and he responded saying I know you don’t I?i stayed yes and told him my name. He stated yes you stayed at my hostel last year. I stated yes. He asked what was my plan and I told him my plan was to stay at his hostel. I told him I called earlier but had to leave a voicemail message. He said no worries I take you there. What a streak of luck that was to find the hostel owner at that location. Zen said he was just dropping off the female section hiker. Wow, I was lucky on that one. On the ride to the hostel we talked about the last time we met and how things had changed over the year. Along the way we stopped at Deep Gap and two hikers flagged us down needing an emergency ride to the nearest hospital. One of the hiked sustained a sever lacerations to the left calf area of his leg. He had bandaged it an applied a turnaquet to stop the bleeding. Zen loaded him in to the truck and off we went to the hospital emergency room in Blairsville, GA. After we dropped them off, we then headed back into NC to the hostel in Franklin. What a long day it has been. A long and wild day. Glad I had a good hot shower, a meal and now bed time.

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617271,"5/2/18 woke up feeling real bad and exhausted from coufing all night and my sinus draining into my throat (glad I had a private room and didn't disturb the other hikers). After eating breakfast of grits, eggs beef jerk and a bowl of cereal and tow pancakes, I decided I had to see a doctor. This sinus infection was wearing me down and sapping all of my strength. I knew I was in dire need of medical help and was not going to ignore it. I had tried to self medicated from over the counter stuff but it was like pissing in the wind, it wasnt working. Afyert breakfast, I walked the mile and a half to the urgent care clinic because the hostel owner Zen was out on a shuttle run. I made it ti the clinic and checked in and waited. After about a half hour, they called me back to the treatment area. I explained everything join on with me and that I was hiking the AT and all the wet and cold conditions. The doctor examined me and they took X-rays and sample of what was up my nose and and what came out of the throat. All I can say is that it wasnt pretty lol. the doctor told me I needed to go home and not like today but yesterday by 2X. Oh well, I guess its serious then I said and she replied its getting beyond that. the good news ws that there was no indication of puemonia. But it was a serious infection she believed was caused by all the mold and high pollen out in the woods I was exposed to along with the wet damp conditions from all the rain. I was prescribed antibiotic, steroids, cough suppressants and an inhaler. I lef the clinic and walked across the parking lot to the pharmacy and got my prescriptions field and made the mile and a half walk back to the hostel. Once back at the hostel I contemplated my next move and what I needed to do to get back home. I contacted enterprise car rental and booked a oneway rental. Guess I'll be headed home soon ugh that sucks big time but my heal is mor important than the trail for right now. I went out to dinner with a few other hikers I had met on the trail and they were bummed out about my situation and wished me luck with my recovery. A couple of them said they had felt the same but self medicated earl on in the time they thought or got the feeling something was going on. Well we had a good meal and lighting and talking together. Looks like this will end my journey for now. I hope to return after this infection clears up (hopefully within a week or tow). I am exhausted and got a long drive home tom mow so good nite and ""Keep Pounding"" Viet Nam Vet""","Franklin, NC
