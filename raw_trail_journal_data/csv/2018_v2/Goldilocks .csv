Goldilocks ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597452,"Tom Leonard Shelter to Shaker Campsite to Jerusalem Road to Lee13 milesOh you think you’ve heard this story before. Tonight around five o’clock just after a rain and little thunder, Goldilocks got back from the stream with her water and started cooking her dinner. It was usual fare ..her evening porridge is minute rice and lentils, textured vegetable protein, sun dried tomatoes and kale with some creamed coconut and bouillon. She’s a bit of an odd duck when it comes to camp cooking, I know. That may be why her backpack is too heavy for her scrawny back but that is another story. 
However, on this Sunday eve, there was an admirer of her culinary skills who arrived right behind her before the rice was even soft. Goldilocks heard a soft rustle in the woods and turned to see Mama bear and her  two little cubs. The cubs became balls of fur that scrambled up a tall tree. Mama bear, her nose in the air, came toward Goldilocks and her stew on the picnic table. Startled, Goldilocks retreated, her food bag and phone in hand. A tent platform with River inside her tent was right there. Goldilocks said, “River, Mama bear and her cubs are here and my foods still on the table.” River said to make some noise. And that’s what they did. They shouted and hollered and whistled. Goldilocks grabbed her pot of food off the table and recruited the rest of camp.Together, they all five did try to send this bear away. She sniffed at the bear box just off the trail, but did not, would not, go away. She stood and watched the strange humans awhile.
We banded together at the wall where we gathered our bags of food. From this fortress of food we saw we could no longer defend our camp. It was decided we must abandon our ground. We packed up our tents, that were up just long enough to get wet with the rain. As Mama and cubs were still at entrance to camp,  we bushwacked our way out of camp back to the trail to walk north.
Now Goldilocks is journaling late as she rests her blonde head at motel, Super 8. Another day and another adventure. I hope mama found her own dinner in the wild and it was just right.","

Goldilocks ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596271,"Slept well on the platform last night. Up at 4:30 to pee. It was a beautiful night. 
Stayed in my tent until 8 this morning. Didn’t leave til 9:30 or so. It was the latest start since my first day. The two section hiker guys left just a bit before me. I’m glad I made it to that shelter last night and the people there weren’t so keen on tenting. I was too tired to even finish my entry last night. 
I could feel my left eye swollen today. It still is. I think it’s a bug bite. I think it's a bit better, but still swollen, though my ear is almost back to normal. 
It was a beautiful morning too. Didn’t seem too hot although sweat was dripping off me once I started walking. It was a quick hike to the road. I got a ride in the first five minutes. Guy turned around to come back for me. He is a contractor, so he had to move some stuff to make room for me. 
First stop was for a burrito. I'm so happy I got my money back yesterday and could eat today! I went to the outfitters and resupplied fuel. They also had every size of opinel knives like the one I lost! From keychain size to big. I really wanted the tiny ones, but I got one maybe a size down from what I lost. 
They even have a td bank here! I came across the street to a coffee shop for WiFi to transfer some money so I can take out a bit as I imagine this hostel is cash only. Had to wait twenty minutes for not great coffee since I only had cash for brewed and it’s serve yourself. Plus just a hotspot I could have used without buying anything. Hot out. Still have to get to the grocery store half mile away so time to move again. It's been pretty restful at the hostel although there always seems to be lots to take up your time on these days off from hiking.  Walked to the grocery store and got some food. I got a shuttle from the hostel. It's a nice quiet setting. I'm in a room with two other guys. Everyone here is an old guy except for one young couple who have their own room. At least it's single beds, not bunks and three to a room. Getting a shower in a clean place felt really good after a week being drenched in sweat. Every morning I take my t-shirt down from where I hang it in my tent and put it on still wet with yesterday's sweat. It starts to dry while I eat breakfast before this day's sweat begins. So, I scrubbed myself and scrubbed my laundry, packed my food and talked to my sister. I made a late dinner. It's now well past hiker midnight; it's 9:47 in fact! I couldn't get the pictures uploaded from my phone. I'm not an iphone fan. Everything seems so idiosyncratic and only longtime iphone users know the key or the right app. The shuttle back to trail leaves at 7am. I might get the shuttle to town at 10 instead and hitch back. I'm not sure what happened to my motivation to get 'caught up' on my mileage. Anyway, it feels about time for bed. I still have all clothes all over my bed and will have to pack it by headlamp so as not to disturb my roomates. It's been nice to cook dinner in a kitchen and feel homey, but I never could quite get used to the communal sleep space with strangers that is hostel life. Internal playlist: My brain didn't need to do too much work to entertain me today. Town life is busy compared to the trail. I felt like a woodland creature waiting to cross the road today with cars zooming by not knowing when the next one was coming around the curve.  There were some old Crystal Gayle songs in my head this afternoon. They are the songs of my formative years that stay stuck in my head when not much else is going on in there. They are the familiar and comfortable. Relaxing I guess. I hear fireworks going off somewhere. I thought I might see some in town tonight actually but it's not that kind of set up here. It's a drive into town. My belly is full, my armpits are fresh and my eyes are sleepy so time to find my pillow. ","

Goldilocks ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597448,"Manchester Center to somewhere past Griffith lake
11 miles 
Camped in the woods just off the trail about a mile after Griffith lake. I stopped for water and ate dinner at the last shelter and then moved on. It is a pay campsite and there were quite a few people there already. It wasn't anything special and I had time to hike a bit more.  There was a couple there with their baby and dog and the Vermont woman with her dog. Sunset and Dingo showed up there after the caretaker left. 
Didn’t sleep much or well last night so been feeling pissy all day. Couldn’t sleep in the hostel.  I finally went downstairs to sleep on a couch and some guy comes in and sleeps on the other couch. I told Duffy I’d go into town with them at ten because I couldn’t sleep last night. I slept lightly for a couple hours this morning and showered again. Felt sweaty. Downstairs sunset and Dingo we’re finishing breakfast. I made my pancakes and coffee and ate the rest of my strawberries and cherries. Was pretty full. While I was packing up Jeff came and did he would drive me back to the trail for free. Maybe he felt bad I had a bad stay or maybe he just felt like driving the five miles. Anyway, I was grateful for that because it may have taken awhile to hitch out and I probably would have hung out in town too long. O course that also meant I had to eat what I didn’t want to carry on the trail.. yogurt and banana. I was really stuffed. I threw out the leftover noodles from last night. Buying those was a mistake. Been carrying them around over a week.
No phone signal at the parking lot; I forgot to call the post office to reroute the package from Williamstown. When I got one bar at a summit the lady told me I had to come in or do something online for them to send it. Then lost connection. Geez that town! I’ve never been there and it’s been only grief. My pack was heavy walking and it was uphill for a few miles. It's still hot and so I was drenched in sweat in no time. 
I walked through a meadow uphill at midday to get to the top of Bromley mountain where there’s a ski lift! There's a little cabin there and hikers are allowed to stay in if they want. It's strange to see the chairlifts and stuff in the summer. At first it looked deserted like it was defunct and derelict. But no, it’s just a ski hill in the summer. I sat outside the hut for a snack and guys started working on something down the path. So, it's still a busy place after all. 
I met some weekender guys and their dog at the top of the next peak, Styles summit. They were sobo and said Griffith Lake was not worth staying at. 
So, here I am in the dark in the woods just like I wanted. Mosquitoes and flies still buzzing. 
Inner playlist:
Crying by Aerosmith 
Feeling fragile from lack of sleep and how dealing with the post office is always a struggle. 
Don’t walk away by Pat Benetar. I'm surprised she hasn't shown up more on my list.  I can walk away from petty difficulties. Perhaps I can do that. It's called letting it go.  But, deeper conflicts follow you around. I know they won't be outrun so walking around is more about making peace. 
Two sparrows in a hurricane-Tanya Tucker. Not sure where that one came from. Guess it's one of her more melancholy yet hopeful songs.

Goldilocks ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597450,"Lincoln NH It was a hazy, humid and initially rainy zero in Lincoln today. It was hot last night but I slept a couple hours. There were a lot of people in the garage but pretty quiet. I got up around 8. Before we left to go for breakfast, Chet went around with fresh donuts his sister had brought! It made me realize how much I was craving high fat food. Sunset, Prophet and I headed out into the rain to the Bagel place for sandwiches and coffee. My umbrella has been more practical in town than on the trail.  HellyaJesus was there and we sat at the table there. We spent a long time there and Dingo eventually came by. It was my second turkey sandwich in Lincoln. ha. I went to the drugstore and then to the library. It was nice to type on a keyboard again; funny the things you miss haha. I went back to Chet's to get some stuff and then met Prophet coming out of the library. I was already hungry and sleepy again so I was thinking of more coffee and donuts, but he was going to get a burger and I thought a real meal might be a better choice than a quick hit of caffeine and sugar. The burger place was nice and I gobbled up the veggie burger with guac and fries. I don't even remember the last time I ordered fries before this hike, but I seem to have developed a taste for them. Prophet went to get a package at the post office and I did get more coffee and a donut. My body seems to crave gaining back its lost pounds in one day. I got my groceries at Price chopper and packed up my bag back at Chet's. New people had arrived including Firecracker who is doing the same section as me. I came back to the library to upload some pictures from my camera though they are uploading so slow I don't think I will get most of them. I'm feeling sleepy again and not hungry yet though I bought quite a bit of food at the grocery store to have for dinner. I was going to set up my tent tonight but it may just be easier to stay in the bunk. I had too much coffee today so not sure I can sleep anyhow. I saw the gang heading out while I was walking back with my groceries. To happy hour at a bar I presume. I don't have the inclination or money for that at the moment anyway. ","
