Genesis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528460,"So after much thought we are going to start our 2017 thru hike the last week in September 2016. Living in southcentral PA and close to the trail we will take a week and hike NOBO from Harpers Ferry to Pine Grove Furnace, PA. Since I will still be working I will take a week of vacation to do this hike with my sister (retired) and another friend (also retired). We will do section hikes for the rest of 2016 and January and February 2017 trying to get all of PA completed. Once I retire in the middle of March 2017 we will go back to Harpers Ferry and SOBO to Springer Mountain, then flip-flop back to where we left the northern part of the trail and NOBO. If anyone else is planning on SOBO staring at Harpers Ferry in March 2017 let me know. With so many hikers starting at Springer Mountain we wanted to avoid the large crowds. Our plan is to complete the entire trail in 1 year. We have been doing weekend or long weekend hiking on the AT and other trails in PA. We still have a lot to learn, but most of that learning will come on the thru hike. Hope to see you on the trail in ""17"".","

Genesis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580527,"Looks like some of our schedules are about the same. After working almost 35 years in the nuclear power industry I plan on retiring 1/31/18. I tell my work in 2 days:). I will start hiking north the week of 2/12/18. Not sure of the exact date yet. My sister is planning on starting with me. She is talking about taking her car down to do some slack packing. She is not sure how far she will go. She is already retired. I live in south central PA and we have almost all of PA done so far, but I will redo it in 2018. So to get an earlier start, weather permitting we plan on starting at Harpers Ferry the week of 1/15/18 (Martin Luther King's holiday day plus 4 days of vacation) and hike north for about 6 - 7 days and try to get to Pine Grove Furnace. Maybe slack packing since we live so close. I'll go back to work and then retire 1 1/2 weeks later. I may try to get 1 or 2 weekends in and get a little further north before I travel down to Springer. Maybe to Boiling Springs. So when I get up to Harpers Ferry after I start at Springer I will jump up to where I stop in January/February. Good luck to all of us and I hope our paths will cross.

Genesis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580668,"Last Wednesday I informed my work that I was retiring 1/31/18.  So now it's official.  Time to get serious. Also took another overnighter on the AT from Rt 72 to Rt 325 in PA.  Nice on Friday but finished out in sleet and then heavy downpour.  Temps in the mid 30's.  Better get used to it. With all the pre-hikes my sister and I have taken we only have about 45 miles left in PA to have the state done, but I will do it all over again next year.",,View Entry,"Nov 19, Sun",0
Genesis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580964,Right now I have a 2- person Northface Tadpole tent. I really like it but a little over 5 lbs I believe.  My sister has a Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL 1 Tent.  It only weights 2 lbs 8 oz.  Big difference. So right now I have hers set up in my family room looking at it to see if I like it.  I have climbed in to make sure I can live in there for the next 5 - 6 months.  Smaller but livable and my feet will like the lighter weight. It is expensive to buy but I have to give this old body every  opportunity to succeed on this long trek. So I will probably wait to see if it goes on sale in the next couple weeks and if it does I will buy it.,,View Entry,"Dec 03, Sun",0

Genesis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582086,Since we live close to the AT in PA my sister and I are starting our hike tomorrow. We will cover the trail from Harper’s Ferry to Pine Grove Furance over the next week. Do to the weather this coming week we will be doing some slack packing and overnights. I will come home and retire and then hike farther north until the end of February. I have a doctors appointment at the end of February.  Then my sister will take me to Springer Mountain hoping to beat the rush.,,View Entry,"Jan 13, Sat",0
Genesis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582442,"This is my first 'trail' entry.  All the rest were 'preparations entries'. My desire to do a thru hike on the AT occurred several years ago.  Back in the early 70's I did do the 100 wilderness and summited Katahdin with the Boy Scouts not knowing that 40+ years later I would be planning to see her again.  Over the past several years I have hiked almost the entire PA section of the trail, but will do it again this year (yea...rocks!!!), plus the Black Forest Trail and West Rim Trail both in northern PA.Over the last several years I have been following many hikers on Trail Journals and U-Tube waiting for my time to do my posts.  Some of the hikers include Hudson, Early Riser, and Blackalachian.  All pretty cool and I have learned a lot not only from them but all I have followed, plus the 12 - 15 books I have read.  So thanks to all.So my sister (Maxine) and I started our hike last week.  Since we live in southern PA and close to the trail we decided to get the section from Harpers Ferry to Caledonia State Park done.  So with the temperatures ranging from 12 degrees to 28 degrees and winds and snow we worked out a plan to slack pack the entire section.  The last 2 days we hiked in 3 - 4 inches of snow in northern MD and southern PA. I am retiring this Wednesday after working almost 35 years in the nuclear power generation business, so after that back on the trail heading north, weather permitting to hopefully Duncannon (get to eat at the Doyle again!!!) before heading to Springer mountain at the end of February hoping to miss the big crowd. I have a cabin about 3 miles south of Pine Grove Furnace and about .5 miles from the AT so that will be my base for several hikes until I get north of Boiling Springs.  I have several appointments in February so that is the delay to Springer Mountain.  Maxine will be on the trail with me hopefully all through GA and other parts as I head north.  Hopefully I can talk her into staying with me the whole way up to Harpers Ferry.  As I learn to add pictures I will add more from our hike last week.  Good Luck to all 2018 hikers.","Harpers Ferry

I wanted to continue to Boiling Springs but it does not look like I will make it.  I'll get that when I get up here in about 2- 3 months. A couple things to take care of this week and then drive to Springer on the 27th to head north with my sister (Maxine).  Looks like the weather is warning up a little down there compared to PA. We got 3 inches of snow last night, but most melted today.  Good luck to all...","

Genesis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583648,Good day to be hiking. Sun came out some but clouded up so not to hot. About 14 left Neels Gap and were all headed for the same shelter (low Gap shelter) since there are calling for rain tonight and tomorrow morning. When we got there there were already 7 in the shelter. Most already in sleeping bags around 3:30. There were several camp sites available but we decided to hike a little farther. So we got water and hiked an extra 1.2 miles to the next campsite. It’s called poplar stamp gap. Hope we stay dry. We are the only ones here tonight. So far but getting late and dark. Getting close to 7 pm so that means night time.,"

Genesis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583767,Coming off Blue Mountain on a very rainy Tuesday both knees started to hurt.  Spent the night in town and didn't get much sleep.  Decided to drive back to PA to recoup (10 hour drive).  I'll give them a day or two to rest. Plans are to do some more hiking on the AT in PA to not lose so many days.  I will start in Pine Grove Furnace and head north.  These PA mountains are babies compared to the mountains in GA.  Met some great people on the trail.  Great shuttle drivers like Bret (got his name from Neels Gap) and the famous Miss Janet that saved our butts in Unicoi Gap. Plans are to drive back to Unicoi Gap over Easter Weekend and head north again.  The journey will continue. I wanted to be in front of the bubble now I may be in the middle of it.  It is what it is.,"Hiawassee

Genesis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584218,Two weeks ago I got off the trail due to pain in both knees at Unicoi Gap. The climb down Blue Mountain did them in.  My sister and I drove back to PA so I could rest the knees.  A couple days later I hiked from Pine Grove Furnace to Boiling Springs about 20 miles in two days.  Still had some pain but have been relaxing since then. Of course the PA mountains aren't anything like the GA mountains.  I will be wearing a knee brace to start out. So today I booked a flight to Atlanta for next Wednesday and after a short train ride to North Springs I will be picked up and taken to Unicoi Gap where I left off.  It will be nice to get back on the trail.  I'm sure I will not meet up with the hikers I hiked with a couple weeks ago but am sure that I will be with other great hikers.,"

Genesis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584618,So it’s been a long day. As most of you know PA was hammered with a big snow storm yesterday and today. So I had a flight out of Baltimore (BWI) this morning so my wife and I drove from home to BWI last night in the snow. Saw a lot of accidents and cars that slide off the road but we made it to our hotel. Actually once we hit the beltway around Baltimore it was just rain.So this morning the weather was a mixture of rain and snow at the airport. My wife dropped me off and she left for Home. She had a long drive home again. Roads were ok until she got back to the PA line on route 83. Then it got bad but she made it home safely. Now for me. I checked in with Spirit airway. No problem I thought. Got to my gate and everything was on time. Boarded the plane and we were told we had to de-ice before we could leave. After waiting in line for about an hour and being 5 planes away from getting de-iced the airport ran out of de-icing fluid. Not sure how that happens at an airport like BWI. So we went back to the gate. By now it had really started to snow heavily. So we sat at the gate for about another hour or two. Other planes started to come back also. Finally they got more fluid and we were told we could leave. But before we leave a mechanical problem. Got that fixed. So back we go in line to de-ice. So after about another hour wait we finally are ready and off we go. We land in Atlanta and I go to get my backpack. Guess what?  No backpack at the airport. So off I go to Spirit baggage office and hand them my receipt. She looks at me and says this is not my luggage tag. I look at it and it’s a girls name. Imagine that. So somehow they placed the wrong tag on my luggage. Lesson learn check your luggage receipt before you leave. So they found my backpack heading for Las Vegas. Hope the girl didn’t have anything important in her bag for LV. Hopefully they can get it back to Atlanta tomorrow between 10-3 through Dallas. So Found a hotel and spending another night in a hotel when I should be back on the trail. I know the trail is hard to hike but didn’t think it was this hard to get back to it. I had a ride set up at North Springs but had to call them and tell them I will not be making it. They were already there waiting. I felt real bad about that but have rescheduled with them tomorrow if my pack shows up. So stay tune for tomorrow’s report. By the way I’m posting my pictures on Instagram under rickmiller4441. Or #genesisat. Later!!!,"

Genesis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585064,"So after spending two nights in a hotel in Atlanta I finally got back to the trail Friday afternoon.   I missed two nice days of hiking due to Spirits mishandling of my backpack.  So with my bad knees I only intended to hike to Cheese Factory campsite.  Very cool site.  I tented with about 15 hikers. Some thru hikers just out of high school and a few out of college and several on college break doing a 5 day hike.  My tent was under high mountain laurel.  The next day I hiked over Tray Mountain which was not that bad but I think Kelly mountain was much worse.  During  that day I didn't feel good (almost ran our out TP) and the motivation was gone (maybe spending the 2 nights in the hotel) and the knee problem was still with me.  So on the trail  I called my wife in PA to pick me up in Hiawassee. I spent the night tenting at Deep Gap Shelter. It was loaded with hikers.  A nice fire was going and good discussion until the thunder and rain hit and everyone went into the shelter or their tents. It poured all night. I made it to Dick's Creek Gap the next morning where I got a ride into Hiawassee. A lot of hikers were going into town to dry out.

For my wife she left at midnight and drove through a snow storm Saturday into Sunday morning.  She actually sat on interstate 81 in Virginia for 1.5 hours in traffic because the snow and ice were so bad. It should have taken 10 hours for the drive but took her 13.5 hours. Her being a teacher she didn't want to miss school the next day since it was picture day with her kids so after a 10 minute break back in the car for the 10 hour drive home.  Roads were ok going home. Got home at 00:30 hours Monday morning. God bless her. It would have been a lot easier for her and me to fly back from Atlanta to Baltimore where she could have picked me up.    Right now I'm at home resting my knees and have talked to a therapist about building up my knees, which I will do.
So now my sister and I plan on going back and pick up where I left off at the end of April.  I will have a lighter (smaller) backpack and not as much winter clothes and lighter and smaller sleeping bag. Not sure how far I will go but I will find out. I still have 9 months to finish this calendar year or 11 months to finish in a year.  I would rather do it all this year.  While in PA I may do some more of the tail in PA.  That will help me keep in shape and continue my mileage.  I have already completed from Harpers Ferry to Boiling Springs this year so all is not lost.","Unicoi Gap

Genesis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587231,So after some rest and exercising my knees I am ready to head back to northern GA and continue my hike.  While back in PA I have gone from Pine Grove Furnace to mile mark 1182 at PA 72 and PA 443. So now I have completed this year from Harper's Ferry to PA 72 (158 miles).  With the 69 miles completed in GA I am still going to try to complete my thru hike in one year. My sister and I will be heading back to GA next Tuesday or Wednesday.  From there we will head north.  Maybe the third time will be the charm:).,"

Genesis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588527,"So last Tuesday my sister and I went back to GA to finish it. She still had to finish from Unico Gap to Dick’s Creek Gap so I slacked packer her.  She went SOBO from Dicks Creek and I met her at Cheese Factory campsite that night and we both tented there. Also there was a hiker named Tom. He is 84 years old. He is doing both the trail and a little forest road but having fun. 
The next day my sister hiked out. While she was hiking I shuttled several hikers from Dicks Creek Gap to Hiawassee and one hiker from Denmark back to Dicks Creek Gap. That night we stayed in Helen. What a neat place. We also took two trips back and forth to shuttle 4 hikers. It was cold and rainy and they couldn’t find a ride. Helen is a small town designed like a German town. 
So on Friday we started heading north at Dicks Creek Gap. After about 9 miles we past the GA/NC state line. Finally out of GA. Once in NC we were greated with two big climbs. Bly mountain and Courthouse Bald. That night we tented at Muskrat Creek Shelter. About 15 other hikers were also there. 
Next morning we started another climb up Standing Indian Mountain. That night we tented at Carter Gap Shelter with the same hikers. Great place to watch the sunset for the evening  
Sunday morning we started out with Albert mountain. Elevation 5052. It was a good climb up until the last about 300 yards then it was up over rocks until we got to the tower. Had lunch up there with great views all around. The hike down we reached the 100 mile mark. The next 2-3 miles down were pretty easy with very few rocks. Around 3 o’clock we discussed going an extra 4 miles to get off the trail at Winding Stair Gap or tent around Rock Gap Shelter. Needless to say after the warm weather and smelly clothes we decided to do the extra miles and get food, shower and clean our clothes. Felt good. So we hiked 16 miles yesterday. 
Today we took a zero and moved a car up to NOC. Had lunch there and are now in Franklin. Tomorrow we head back to Winding Stair Gap and continue north.

Genesis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605882,"So my hike on the AT didn't go exactly as I had planned but I did meet a lot of great people and hiked 545 miles.  Most of my miles hiked were with my sister. I have from Springer Mountain to Rt 40 in TN complete and from VA 601 (mile mark 991) to PA/NJ line (into NJ).  Trail problems encountered were the weather (started March 1), sickness, injuries, some family stuff, and injury to my wife that needed 7 weeks of my time. It is what it is. Being on and off the trail several times I got to meet many different hikers which was neat.  I still plan on continuing when I can this winter and also in the spring of 2019.  I need to stay in shape for my trek up to Mount Everest Base Camp in May 2019.  The views down south were unbelievable.  I truly do miss them, the trail community, and the trail.  I did not met one bad person and met many helping hikers and trail angels. If you're ever considering thru-hiking on the AT do it.  It's a great life experience.  If possible do it when your young. Another thru-hike attempt is not out of the question. I'm only 61:).  Congratulations to all the NOBO thru hikers that made it to Maine and SOBO hikers that made it to Springer (some are still on the trail).  I also got to meet and support several of the SOBO hikers since I live in PA close to the trail.  Also good luck to 2019 hikers...","
