Plumber Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584655,"This will be my first entry for what I hope to be my story of my attempt to thru hike the Appalachian Trail.  I have always wanted to make this trip since clear back when I was 10 years old after reading about the trail in Boy’s Life magazine as a cub scout.  
My starting date should be April 29th and I will be doing a “flip-flop” hike starting at Harpers Ferry in West Virginia. From there I'll travel north to Mount Katahdin in Maine (a distance of about 1100 miles), where my wife, Libby, will pick me up and drive me back to Harpers Ferry.  I’ll then walk to the southern terminus atop Springer Mountain in Georgia (approximately another 1100 miles). My initial estimated finish date is (hopefully) October 4th making the total trip 159 days which averages out to about 14 miles per day, which I feel is quite doable.  Of course this also factors in zero days where I don’t hike at all, which I believe I’ve allowed for about 10, so actual days where I’m walking will be closer to 15 or 16 miles.  Of course this schedule will be shot to hell as soon as I walk further than planned or sit still on days when the weather may just be too horrible to hike in.

The next few entries I make will be about my preparation for the hike.  From there I will be trying to continuously update my progress after I start at the end of April.  Stay tuned.","N/A

Plumber Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584657,"I originally planned on starting my thru hike at the southern terminus in Georgia and walking north to Maine. It’s my understanding that nearly 90% of thru hikers choose this option, but I switched to a flip flop hike for a few different reasons.  For one the Appalachian Trail Conservancy has begun recommending the flip-flop because it puts much less stress on the trail, what with over 3000 people per year attempting a thru hike.  Most of these hikers start out in a relatively narrow time frame, usually spanning from mid-March to early April which results in a huge “bubble” of people moving along the trail at the same time.  This can make the competition for space at shelters, hostels and even ground to set up a tent a little dicey.  God knows hiking the trail is going to be challenging enough let alone jockeying for a spot in a trail shelter on a rainy, cold night.  Also, the north terminus on Mount Katahdin in Maine closes down in mid-October, and while I feel that there would have been plenty of time to get there had I started in Georgia, by starting at the halfway point in West Virginia, I should get to Katahdin by the end of July with no pressure to rush.  Another reason is that starting at the end of April at Harpers Ferry should put me ahead of the bulk of the north bound thru-hikers. While I’m not necessarily an antisocial person, I think I will enjoy a little more solitude that my flip-flop route will provide.  There are also other positives such as avoiding some of the insect season, a good chance for better weather and less environmental impact on the trail that swayed my starting point. So the choice has been made, it’s flip-flop for me.  The one downside that concerns me is that while I’ll be a fresh “noob” when I leave Harpers Ferry, almost every hiker I meet, north or southbound, will be well seasoned since they will have completed half the trail and are over two months in.  I will probably feel a little self-conscious, but that will be my cross to bear for the first couple hundred miles.","N/A

Plumber Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584768,"In my last post I gave a few of my reasons for opting on a flip-flop route for my thru-hike attempt.  As I stated, I originally planned to start my hike the traditional way, beginning at Springer Mountain in northern Georgia and walking the trail northbound to Maine, starting on either St. Patrick’s Day, or if the weather was too bad, waiting two more weeks and starting out on April 1st, (something seemed appropriate about leaving on April Fool’s Day).  Now, as I look over several of the northbound thru-hiker’s journals (And I suggest you do, too. They make for very good reading), the reasons I gave for switching to a flip-flop seem to be showing that I made the right decision (for me, anyway).  Several journals are lamenting the absolutely miserable weather going on right now at the southern end of the trail.  Tales of snow, sleet, rain and bitter cold are mentioned throughout the journal entries, along with the trail being very well populated due to the “bubble” of thru-hikers moving northward.  Although I know that the thru-hikers who persist will almost certainly end up with fond memories of how they “stuck it out” through these conditions, for me I believe the hike will be hard enough without the added challenge of dealing with these difficulties.  Don’t get me wrong, I’m not even remotely suggesting that it would have been a mistake for me to start at the southern end, it’s just that I’ve now become more comfortable with my decision.  As they say, the battle cry of the Appalachian Trail thru-hiker is, “Hike your own hike!”  And this one will be mine.","At Home

Plumber Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585036,"(After going back and reviewing the last three entries, I see I’ll have to start honing my writing skills.)

My original plan, back about six years ago when I actually committed to making a thru-hike, was to start out in the spring of 2015, and as I said before, do a northbound from Georgia to Maine.  The goal would be to try and finish at Katahdin on August 22nd which would have been my 60th birthday.  However, my wife started lobbying for me to wait, since going in 2015 would have required me to take up to six months off work. She suggested that if I waited until after I retired in August of 2017, it would take a tremendous amount of pressure off of me psychologically since I wouldn’t feel any urgency to start and finish at any particular time to get back to my job.  Also, once I started collecting my pension, there wouldn’t be any financial burden, either.  After all, the top three reasons that people quit the trail are injury, time constraints, and running out of money.  Of course she was right as usual…  So my adventure was pushed back until now, 2018.

I retired seven months ago on August 18th, just shy of my 62nd birthday, after 45 years (!) as a construction plumber.  I started my apprenticeship right out of high school at 17 years old and from then until now it was the only job I’ve ever known.  It was hard work, don’t let anybody tell you otherwise, and leaving it at 62 years old was the right thing to do.  After nearly five decades it was just time to be done with it.  My wife and I celebrated my retirement by heading down to the Smoky Mountains to see the total eclipse of the sun.  (A quick aside, if you’ve never seen a TOTAL eclipse, you MUST make plans to see the next one in 2024.  Nothing can prepare you for what you’ll see. Drag your kids out of school and go to where you’ll see 100% totality. Seeing 99% isn’t 99% as good, you have to see 100%.  It’s without a doubt one of the most magnificent things I’ve ever seen in my life.)  After we got back I went into retirement mode.  You’d think after 45 years of getting up at five every morning it would be difficult to adjust to my new lifestyle, but it was as easy as rolling off a log.  In less than a week I was completely used to getting up when I wanted and doing whatever the hell I pleased.  The only hiccup for me is every once and a while I’ll see a concrete truck rolling down the road or a crane hooked up to a roof top air conditioner on a jobsite and I’ll have a little reoccurring epiphany and think to myself, “You don’t do that anymore”, and grin.  Retiring was the best business decision I’ve ever made and my advice to anyone even remotely considering it is this, If you want to get out, and you can get out… GET OUT!

But enough of this annoying autobiographical pause, now on to life’s next great adventure.","

Plumber Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585231,"One month from today, barring unforeseen circumstances, I’ll have begun my thru-hike. Now with only a month left, more and more of my attention is diverting to the hike until it’s nearly the only thing I think about.  Motel reservations have already been made in Harpers Ferry for a couple of days stay so my wife and I can relax and have a look around before she sends me off into the woods.  With that detail taken care of the only thing I have to do is inventory my gear, and pack and unpack over and over to make sure I have everything and it all fits into my backpack.

  Over the last 6 years I’ve been slowly accumulating gear for my adventure.  Now, before some of you experienced hikers read this journal, I will say in advance… I know, I know, I’m probably starting off carrying too much in my pack.  When I first started planning for the hike a few years back the rule of thumb was the base weight of the pack (everything except food and water) was good if you kept it at or under 25 pounds, and after adding food and water, 40 pounds was pretty much acceptable.  However, now looking at the journals and blogs over the last few months it seems that the weight dropped down to under 20 pounds base weight and a loaded weight total of 30 or under.  After loading and weighing my pack all I could manage was a base weight of 23 pounds and loaded weight total of about 35 pounds. That’s with a five day food supply and two liters of water.  Of course the weight of the food will start going down the minute I hit the trail.  That being said I’m sure  I’ll start shedding weight within the first couple of weeks as, like all thru-hikers, I find out what I need and what I don’t.  Right now my plan is to start out with winter gear (more or less) in that I’ll be carrying a puffer jacket, gloves, a stocking cap, etc.  I’d rather start with it and get rid of it than need it desperately the first few days and not have it.  A couple years back I deliberately overloaded my pack  (about 55 to 60 pounds worth) and hiked over the Organ Mountains in New Mexico (a rocky and pretty steep hike in blazing heat) just to test myself to see if I was good with the weight. I’m pretty confident that I’ll be good with my pack weight for the first week on the trail.  Probably the only item I have right now that could be lighter is my synthetic down 15 degree sleeping bag that’s a little heavier than some of the higher tech (and priced) sleeping bags that are available.  Actually, I don’t mind the weight so much as the fact that it probably doesn’t compress as much as I would like, so it steals a little more room than it should.  Regardless, it’s what I’m starting out with and I’m sticking with it, for now, anyway.

  Other that packing and repacking, gear inventory, etc., all I have left to do is make a list and start doing little odds and ends around the house in preparation for my extended adventure.","Still at Home

Plumber Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585566,"There are a few questions that are universally asked once you tell someone that you plan to thru-hike the AT; How long will it take? Where will you sleep? Will you carry a gun? (!!!), and of course, how will you get food along the way?  Feeding yourself, now there’s a good one.

Of course, one of the things most people don’t really understand about hiking the trail is that you’re never actually that far from civilization, and you’re NEVER very far at all from another person on the trail?  The chances of running out of food and just laying down and starving to death are zero. The real issue is being able to carry enough food to nourish yourself sufficiently and be able and continue your hike while feeling relatively healthy.  There are many blogs of hikers who have gorged themselves with nothing but chips, Twinkies, energy shots, etc. and still made a successful thru-hike. However, I’ve decided to try and feed myself a little more conventionally along the way, so I’ll not only finish the trip, but also feel somewhat healthy as I go along. While I’m not a health nut, I also know how nasty I can feel constantly shoving nothing but junk food down my throat for days on end.

I know through experience by monitoring my regular workouts, I can expect to burn upwards to 600 calories per hour on the trail. So, on a typical trail day I’ll probably burn between 4000 to 6000 calories per day.  The trick will be, how to get as many of those calories back without making myself feel crappy and still be able to carry it in a backpack.  Of course, there will be many, MANY times along the trail that I’ll be able to eat in a real restaurant, so there will be a wide variety of food available, but here is my typical daily food line up while traveling along the trail.  Well, at least for the beginning of the trip (The photo shows five days of food):

Breakfast-2 bags instant oatmeal, 2 pop tarts, tea

Snack 1-1 Clif Bar

Snack 2-1 package peanut butter crackers

Lunch-Flour tortilla and peanut butter, 2 cheese sticks, 1 Honeybun

Snack 3 -Clif Bar

Snack 4-1 package peanut butter crackers

Dinner-1 whole bag of either Knorr Rice Side, Knorr Pasta Side or Idahoan Mashed Potatoes, 1 bag of Tuna or Chicken, Tea

This line up should come out to around 3200 calories and it’s about as much as I’m able to stand to eat in a day.  While this will leave me with about a 2000 calorie deficit, I believe it will keep me relatively healthy, strong and keep my morale in pretty good shape at a reasonable price and should be readily available at resupply stops along the trail. Reviewing other hiker’s journals and through other research, I have no plans to ship myself food supplies along the way. It seems like most hikers who try this usually abandon it before too long, since as the trip has become more popular, resupply points have become much more accessible.

So, there you have it, my plans for feeding myself along the Trail. Of course, I’ll be hoping for a little trail magic to break up the monotony along the way, too!!!","N/A

Plumber Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585716,"Selecting gear for the Trail is without a doubt the most challenging part of pre-hike planning.  There are volumes of information devoted to the subject and asking for opinions from even the most seasoned backpacker is like asking how many angels can dance on the head of the notorious pin.  I’m certain that many a debate has come to blows over the subject. One thing everyone agrees on is weight – less is better.  However, the path to reducing pack weight is (apparently) a matter of personal choice.  An item that one thru-hiker sneers at is another’s vital necessity.  Some hikers opt for a $300 down sleeping bag, while others use a minimalistic quilt. Some go for high-tech tents or hammocks, and for others a simple tarp propped up with their trekking poles will do.  I was reading the journal of one successful thru-hiker who carried a two-man tent the entire distance of the AT and slept in shelters the whole way!  He never used it once!

  As I posted earlier, I’ve been accumulating gear over the last six years and I feel pretty good that I’ve managed to keep my pack’s base weight under 25 pounds. To get down to that weight I only needed to swap out two pieces of gear.  First, I abandoned my external frame pack, which I’ve been using for the last few years, for an internal frame Osprey for a weight savings of about 1 ½ pounds.  Next, I swapped out my two-man tent for a lighter weight one man, (2 pounds saved).  This is a decision that concerns me a bit. While the two-man tent seemed incredibly spacious, affording me the luxury of bringing my backpack with all its gear inside the tent, the replacement tent is just big enough for me to lay down in with my shoulders very nearly touching both tent walls, and barely enough height to sit straight up.  While the rain fly does allow enough space to keep my pack and shoes in the dry, getting dressed and packing while inside will be a bit of a challenge.

  Regardless, after packing, unpacking and repacking here is my gear list for at least the start of my flip-flop out of Harpers Ferry:                               
1 – Osprey Volt Backpack w/pack cover

Inside the pack: Clothes- 1 pr. convertible pants, quick drying long sleeve fishing shirt, 1 pr. quick drying briefs, 1 pr. Darn Tough wool socks, 1 pr. Smart Wool socks for sleeping, 1 set lightweight long underwear for staying warm if necessary, 1 pr. lightweight gloves, 1 wool stocking cap, 1 compressible down puffer jacket, 1 rain parka, 1 pr. rain pants, 1 pr. camp shoes.

Camping/Sleeping – Lynx One-man tent, Klymit inflatable mattress, Eureka 15 deg. synthetic down mummy bag, parka/tarp/tent footprint, dry bag for hanging food (when necessary).

First Aid in small zipper bag – 3 antiseptic wipes, 3 sting relief wipes, roll adhesive tape, 3 gauze pads, 6 Band-Aid strips, 3 small butterfly bandages, 6 Q-Tips, 6 cotton balls, 1 Ace Wrap, 2/4x4 moleskins, 15 Ibuprofen tablets, tweezers, small pr. scissors, small container of petroleum jelly.

Hygiene (in small dry sack) – small roll toilet paper, 3 wet wipes, travel size toothpaste, travel toothbrush, travel dental floss, 2 oz. hand sanitizer, 1 oz. Gold Bond Powder, 4 oz liquid castile soap, ½ oz. stick deodorant, small pocket comb.  
Cooking (in small dry sack) – MSR Rocket Stove w/ 4 oz. fuel canister, 16 oz. titanium cup, 32 oz. titanium pot, titanium spork, bubble insulation pot cozy. 
Tech/Electronics (in small dry sack) – MP3 player w/earbuds, iPhone charging cord, recharging battery pack. double port USB brick.

Misc. (in small dry sack) – 50’ paracord, 4 carabiners, 4 ball/cord bungees, 1 pr. shoelaces, sewing kit (2 needles, bobbin of thread, denim patch, misc. buttons), Black Diamond headlamp w/extra batteries, compass, 10’ of Gorilla Tape, Off/Deep Woods (Deet) insect repellent, Bic lighter, small spiral writing pad w/pen, tobacco pipe w/Irish whiskey tobacco, extra pr. eyeglasses w/clip-on sunglasses w/case, AT trail guide book, 2-one liter Smart Water bottles, Sawyer Mini Filter, food supply as needed, Ziploc bags for food and trash as needed.
Prescription drugs (in small dry sack)-that’s another entry, altogether.
Wearing or carrying in pockets – Pr. of convertible pants, quick drying long sleeve fishing shirt, Darn Tough wool socks, Vasque St. Elias GTX shoes, Ballcap, lighter, pocket knife, Gerber Dime multi-tool, chap stick, mini wallet w/ID/cards/etc., smart phone, 2 Mountainsmith Trekking Poles.

  Well, there’s my list and I’m sticking with it for now.  We’ll see if, like we’ve all read about past noob thru-hikers, I’ll be pitching gear out along the trail for the first mile of the trip…

Plumber Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588098,"Well, here we are down to it. This is my last day at home before we head to my flip-flop starting point at Harpers Ferry, WV.  If things go as planned I won’t be sleeping in my own bed for the next five months and it certainly seems “unreal”. Over the last couple of days, I’ve been trying to get all the ducks in a row here at home while I also continue to organize gear for my thru-hike.  Tuesday, I went for my regular check-up at the dentist and the hygienist asked if my wife had any special plans while I’m gone. I said, “Yeah, she plans on sleeping right in the middle of the bed!”.   Yesterday I visited my in-laws for a bit and also got a haircut.  Knowing there’s a real possibility that I might not get another haircut for several months I made sure to get it cut REALLY short.  Then last night I went out for a couple beers with my older brother and a couple of old friends like we’ve done every Wednesday for years, and it was strange knowing that I won’t be doing that for a long time.

  Today I loaded my pack for the last time and I’m a little discouraged that it’s a bit heavier than I would like, but I know within a week or two I’ll have figured out the things I need and the things I can ship back home.  Also, I’m certain I’m starting out with WAY too much food but that’ll take care of itself sooner than later.  
 Regardless, tomorrow morning it’s off to West Virginia I go, getting there tomorrow afternoon and then having a little look around on Saturday.  I looks like The Appalachian Trail Conservancy is hosting the 4th Annual Flip Flop Festival on Saturday and Sunday so that’ll be a nice distraction before I take the first steps of my thru-hike on Sunday morning as I begin my march toward Maine. 
However, tonight I'll enjoy sleeping in my own bed…","Still at Home

Plumber Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588236,"Laying awake in bed at our hotel in Harpers Ferry. We arrived here yesterday after an uneventful 500 mile drive from Indy. After a quick drive around to check things out we returned to to hotel where Libby and I ate and enjoyed a couple of beers at The White Horse Tavern that’s part of the hotel where we’re staying. We were pleased that they were tuned into the Pacer/Cleveland game and enjoyed watching the Pacers spank the Cavs, although I’m sure we were the only ones in the whole place that cared whether Indiana won or not.
  Earlier, as we drove past the Appalachian Trail Conservancy we did see one hiker coming out of the building wearing dreadlocks. The pack he was carrying seemed tiny compared to my Osprey.
  As I mentioned in the previous post, I’m not real happy with my pack weight and when I weighed it at home before we left it was now tipping the scale just north of 40 lbs. After we checked into our room I emptied out my backpack and Libby and I started going through all the gear once again to see what I could shed. We culled out some items that, after several small debates, we both agreed were unnecessary or at least could be down-sized. Today we plan on going into town to replace some of the items with lighter weight alternatives. I was carrying an 8 oz. fuel canister but will exchange it for a smaller 4oz. I ditched my one quart pot and will rely solely on my 16 oz. titanium cup for all my kitchen needs. Got rid of the compass since my phone has one on it and I’m hoping I probably won’t need it anyway. Tossed out the 4 oz. liquid soap and small deodorant in favor of a small pack of wet wipes. Today I’ll try to find a lighter weight dry sack to hang my food when it’s necessary. Also ditching the 1 lb. jar of peanut butter in favor of the lighter individual packets.
  Today, after we get my gear back in order, we plan to nose around some the events that the ATC has planned for the 4th Annual Flip Flop Festival that’s going on this weekend. There’s supposed to be a few bands playing this afternoon so we’ll definitely be around for that. We’ll also check in at the ATC building and sign myself up for my adventure. 
  Finally I’ll mention that, as I spread all of my gear out in the hotel room yesterday, I was well aware of how clean and new it all looked. I guess until I dirty it up over the next few days I’m going to feel more than a little self conscious when compared to the hikers I’ll meet who have already walked a thousand miles. Also it will take a couple weeks until I get comfortable with the “trail etiquette” that the experienced hikers already are familiar with. Somehow or other, I’m sure I’ll survive the embarrassment of my “rookie-ness”.
Last but not least. While I was moving our luggage from the car to our hotel room the last thing I grabbed was my backpack. I slung it up on my shoulders and as I walked across the parking lot a father who was standing close by leaned over and said to his little girl, “Look sweetheart, he’s a thru-hiker.”

Plumber Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588399,"Early this morning, as I laid in bed next to my sleeping wife, my head felt like it was home to a hive of bees, buzzing angrily with a thousand thoughts. The only thing I can compare it to is years ago when my brothers and I used to compete in SCCA amateur road racing. The night before the race I would lie awake with simultaneous feelings of excitement, fear and dread making sleep nearly impossible. 
 The afternoon before Lib and I reloaded my backpack for the final time and then went into town where I enjoyed a steak dinner before hitting the sack for what I hoped would be a good nights rest. No dice.
   Libby woke and we got up, heading to the hotels continental breakfast where I threw about three waffles into my head, then went back to our room, collected our stuff and drove back to the ATC, where we followed the blue blazes down a set of steep steps which led to the Appalachian Trail proper. With my home away from home strapped on my back, my wife snapped a picture.  Finally we kissed really hard and then stood there looking at each other, waiting to see who would walk away first, until I finally gave in and walked northbound on the narrow path that snaked down the side of the hill. 
  I was on my way.
Soon the trail emptied out onto a wide flat gravel path that ran along the river for a couple of miles until it turned to the left and headed up a hill. The ascent was steeper the l imagined and continued for quite a while finally flattening out for a bit. Not much further along and the rocks started, often so rugged that, if it weren’t for the white blazes marking the trail, I’d have wondered if it were a trail at all. One section of the trail was a series of steep rocky switchbacks that was a real ego killer. 
I only saw two thru hikers on the trail. The rest were day hikers out with kids enjoying the day. Mostly I was by myself.
  Finally I reached Garthland State Park where I filled up my bottles with fresh water then headed up a last steep climb to the blue blazed trail to Crampton Gap Shelter. After a quarter mile steep down hill walk to the shelter, I found there was room for one more so I set up my air mattress and sleeping bag, made dinner, (Knorr rice) hung my food bag and now I’m laying in my bag at 7:30 on a chilly night typing this entry. Two hikers are still up talking at the campfire but four of us are already waiting for sleep to come. Overall, it was a very challenging day.

Plumber Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588632,"After spending the night in Dahlgreen  Campground I made an attempt to continue on and see how my knee would hold out. I made it half way up the next climb and realized it was going to be futile. My right knee started acting up almost immediately, but I pushed it until it became unbearable.  Heading back down was even worse as I essentially had to walk sideways leading with my right foot every step to ease the pain.  After making it back down to the campground I knew there was no way to continue in this condition.  I made the call to get off the trail, at least for the time being, and phoned my wife to come get me. Knowing it would be 8 hours before she could possibly get here I gingerly made my way 2 1/2 miles west to Boonsboro and, at this moment, I’m sitting in a gazebo at Shafer Park passing time, considering options. I know for sure I need to rest up and get the knee healthy again, and I can tell it’s going to be more than a day or two.
  I’ve never had too much trouble making decisions and I know I usually make the right ones.  I would rather stop now than to get 20 miles from nowhere and be unable to continue, then need to be evacuated  off the trail by some means or another.  While I don’t like it at all, I’m comfortable with that decision.
  What I’m not comfortable with is how fast it all went so wrong. I don’t feel like I made any mistakes or missteps, boom, it just happened like that, and done. Now I need to decide whether to go home, get better, and try again, or give up for now. Libby, (who, at this very moment, is speeding this way to rescue me) God love her, is pushing for me to try again next year or do the trail in sections. What would I ever do without her?
  For now I would like to apologize to all the people who were following me this early in the game who I feel like I’ve let down in some way. However, given the choice I’d rather it happen sooner than later. Better to be stopped in a couple of days than a couple of months when so much time and effort would seem wasted.
Finally, I hope everyone knows that I don’t feel defeated as much as disappointed. Perhaps I WILL try again, if not this year maybe next.  Thanks for all the support from family and friends, and thanks to all of you who’ve taken time to indulge me by reading this journal.","Dahlgreen Campground
