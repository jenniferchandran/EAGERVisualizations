"Captain Obvious (Don), Moses (Ray) and ""name yet to be given or earned"" (Char)",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586278,"When researching backpacking, especially a 2100+ mile multi month trek like the AT (Appalachian Trail) you always hear about “The Big Three”; Tent, Sleep System, and Cook System.  Part 1: Tent.  Let’s be honest here, the last time I backpacked was 40 years ago in the Boy Scouts.  I basically had  a lightweight for the time “pup tent”.  And the last time I slept in a tent it was a GP Medium in Korea, not exactly a “packable” tent.  Bottom line, research had to be done.  Charlene said “Don, you like to research things, pick it out”.  She also tells me to “not be a cheap ass” and get a quality tent that will work for us. A great idea since this will be our home for SIX months in 14 states.Research Engaged.  Back in June we sat down with “Postcard” aka Mark at REI in Marlton, NJ.  He has hiked the AT twice and has a couple books on the experience.  We discussed the various options, looked at a couple of tents, and Postcard made his recommendation.  YouTube video time showed me Tarps, Pop-Ups, Hammocks, 1P,2P,3P tents.  There was Big Agnes, Hyperlite, ZPacks, MSR, REI, and many more brands to choose from.  Books were just as varied and EVERYONE has an opinion.  Guess we need to find out our basic needs to have a starting point.  Packable-obviously, lightweight, comfort, room, ease of setup/teardown.  Oh, and what about our gear, almost forgot we have to put our packs and shoes somewhere.  Using these as filters, I decided upon the Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL3 (what a mouthful) with a footprint/tarp for underneath.  The HV model is a new design with oodles of head/shoulder room and believe it or not, the model first suggested to us.  Lets look at the filters:- Packable – check.  Designed to be compact and we can share the burden of carrying- Lightweight – check.  Overall it weighs about 3 ½ lbs.  Not the lightest but for the room and features this is it.  - Comfort/Room - Sleeps 3 – Why three? Charlene, Me, Gear, and yeah room enough not to kill each other.  - It’s HUGE.  41 sq ft of living space, the 2P only had 29 sq ft.- Ease of setup/teardown – I was able to watch a video and set the tent up without issue and in short order.  - There is even a way to set it up in the rain that keeps your crap dry(ish).- Gear – With the rain fly installed there are two 9 sq ft vestibules for even more room and to keep your wet stuff out of the tent and the rain.  And let it try and dry overnight.",,View Entry,"Aug 20, Sun",0
"Captain Obvious (Don), Moses (Ray) and ""name yet to be given or earned"" (Char)",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586274,"Charlene and I joined a “Meetup” group to get some hiking in and meet new friends while prepping for the AT in about 3 weeks.  Last night the group had a “Blue Moon” hike in the Bass River, NJ State Park.  What is a Blue Moon?  By definition it is “a fairly infrequent phenomenon involving the appearance of an additional full moon within a given period”, in this case the month of March.  No flashlights allowed, uh-huh, well a few showed up and good thing they did as they helped us avoid puddles the size of ponds and fallen trees. And this gave me the chance to test our “head light” the Black Diamond Spot red light feature.  Nice!!!  We hiked between 6 and 7 miles, had great conversations and thanks to a crystal-clear sky the stars and the moon were absolutely wonderful.  A little chilly, but activity and friendship kept everyone warm.",,View Entry,"Mar 31, Sat",0
"Captain Obvious (Don), Moses (Ray) and ""name yet to be given or earned"" (Char)",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586275,"Have you ever been hiking and thought “these insoles feel really hard, I wonder if I should replace them?”  If you are a guy then sure you have, but they are still new, aren’t they!  I looked at them when I got home and said “Damn, these look rough.  I wonder how long they will last?”  At this point Charlene adds from around the corner “Just get new ones already.  Quit being a cheap-ass”.  Looking up my pass Amazon Prime orders they are only from August.  Let’s see that’s 1, 2, 3…, 8 months.  That’s okay, isn’t it?  Wait, we walk about 70,000 steps a per four-day work week or about 33 miles plus weekends.  That means I walked about 40 miles a week at eight months.  So… these insoles have over 1200 miles on them.  Hmmmm, I guess it’s time.  Here are a couple pictures to show the old versus the new. With the Appalachian Trail 10 days away, I’m really glad I decided to update them, and so are my feet",,View Entry,"Apr 09, Mon",0
"Captain Obvious (Don), Moses (Ray) and ""name yet to be given or earned"" (Char)",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587247,Okay quite a few have asked how we are keeping our phones charged. First we picked up Anker E1 6700 upgraded power banks that only weighs about 4.8 ounces. Should give us about 2.5-3 charges. We will be cautious on the use and recharge the Anker when we are in town every 4 days or so.,"Harpers Ferry
