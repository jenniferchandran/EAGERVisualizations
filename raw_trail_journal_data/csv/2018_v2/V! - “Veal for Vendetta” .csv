The AT ""midpoint"" and also home of the ATC headquarters.Feelings: Anxious, Lonely, Excited, Bewildered.Thoughts: What the hell am I doing here??HF is a small, expensive country-type town with country-type people. My Amtrak train from the airport in Baltimore got canceled, so I had to take a $120 Lyft ride here. If you have AT&T, there's basically zero cell reception in the whole town, except for on the corner of the street next to the Town Hall. So here I am standing in the rain trying to say my last goodbyes to people before I'm cut off from the world forever (until Monday) but like FOREVER. Its raining now, but apparently tomorrow through Saturday are supposed to be a god damn hurricane. I heard once that AT thru-hikers spend more than half their trip hiking in the rain, and honestly I believe it. So, it's gonna be a wet one folks! Time to stop fighting the wetness and embrace it!I'll upload my posts here once a week, so stay tuned!","Houston, TX

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591765,"This morning, on my way out of town, I stopped by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters. Probably the coolest little place ever. The guys working there were super nice. They took my photo for the registery book, gave me a tag for my pack, and an overwhelming amount of advice. I found out that i'm the #161st Flip-Flopper of 2018 to start in Harpers Ferry. They wanted to know my whole schedule, why i was doing it, how i heard about it, etc. After talking with them, I felt like they were all so personally invested in my journey that there was no way i could turn back now. lol. I met a kid name Dale on my way out. He's here from Australia and surprisingly also has they same flipflop schedule as me. We were both headed to the same campsite for the night, so we spent most of the day hiking with each other.The hike out of HF was a bitch. There was rain, steep inclines, mud, rocks, did i mention the inclines?! I trained a lot for this, but there is nothing in Texas that could compare to the inclines out here. Like Texas is so damn flat compared to the terrain i'm going into. It's only day 1 and i'm ready to start dropping weight. My pack is around 35 lbs with 5 days of food and it's killing me. Everything is wet. like everything. Trying not to let it get to me though. I camp near a shelter because there's people around and some tenting sites. I don't ever really plan to use the shelters though. I prefer the solace of a tent no matter how hard it's raining. I met 3 NoBos (northbounders who started in Georgia). Raindance, One Shirt, and Spoons. Everyone out here goes by a trail name that was given to them by other hikers. I don't have one yet, but i'm sure it'll come soon enough. I learned of two things today that i really don't like. 1) ringing out my rain and sweat soaked socks before going to bed, and 2) hanging up your bear bag. Every night now before bed, I gotta put all my food in my food bag and hang it high up in a tree so animals don't get it. So, I tied my  carabiner to the end of my rope and through it up into the tree. It got stuck on the first try. Embarrassed and angry, I pull out my knife ready to cut the rope out of the tree and walk away. Luckily though, Raindance and the crew stoped me and decided they were gonna climb the tree and untangle it for me. It turned into a challenge between the 3 of them and was a real sight to see. Thankfully, they got it out. It took me probably another 20 mins though to successfully hang my bag. This will probably be my least favorite part of every day lol.","Harpers Ferry, West Virginia

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591780,"So first night sleeping in the woods and i had a series of really weird dreams. One of them was about a family (mom, dad, and 3 kids) that were trying to push me out of my tent and steal it. The other dream, more like nightmare, was of me waking up to the sound the Texas Chainsaw Masacre outside my tent reving up his chainsaw. I guess that's what I get for watching all those horror movies lol.I left the shelter around the same time the NoBos did. It's weird watching them hike and interact. I can't imagine being at the ""halfway point"" like they are. Both of the guys in the group are wearing really short, tight shorts because apparently this was the best solution to the terrible chaffing they were getting between their legs lol. I don't hike with them for long. Mainly because it takes 3 of my steps to equal 1 of theirs. They got the hiker stride and it'll be about a month until i get mine. While i'm hiking, i really start to crave some Jamba Juice. I would litteraly give anything for a Greens & Ginger smoothie right now. I was so spoiled at my job, and now i'm out here eating Ramen everyday...The trail today passed by an old church built during the civil war time. The caretaker, a chipper guy in his 60s, saw me hiking by and stopped me to ask where i was headed. When i told him Maine he just about freaked out lol. He thought that was the coolest thing ever. He told me all about the church, like who built it and when, and insisted on showing me the inside. There's a wedding happening there tomorrow so a bunch of people were inside decorating. He brought me inside and announced to the room that i was walking to Maine haha! Apparently thru-hikers are celebrities out here. It's crazy how invested strangers get into your own hike. At this point, i feel like the whole world is rooting for me, which is pretty cool. The Pine Knob shelter is mostly full of kids and weekend hikers. I pitch my tent again. I meet several more NoBos. Two being a young couple, Blueberry and Pickle, who both have a strong Alabama accent. And the other being an older guy named K-bar, who reminds you in just about every other sentence that he's an ex-marine lol. I don't expect to see them again after tonight because with their regular 20-25 miles a day they'll be light years ahead of me.","Crampton Gap Shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591785,"The rain lightened up a little today, but still very wet. It feels like the terrain on the trail changes almost every mile. You'll be walking through a thick mudslide that feels like quicksand, then over giant slippery rocks, then through a shallow pond, then a gravel road, then a mowed lawn, etc. Really crazy. Experienced my first set of tech problems day. In order to keep me from going insane, I like to listen to music and podcasts while I hike. So I brought a back-up portable phone charger, so i could keep my phone alive and listen to music throughout the day. But for some reason, i woke up to my phone dead and the charger that it was plugged into overnight just stoped working. i was really pissed about the idea of having to hike in silence for the next couple of days until i can fix/replace it.Fortunately, though I met some slack-packers (people that day hike sections of the trail but drive home at night to sleep in their beds). A group of 3 middle-aged women out here doing some day hiking for the weekend. They call themselves The Grim sisters, which i thought was pretty awesome. They kept me company for most of the day while i hiked. I was surprised i was even able to keep pace with them for as long as I did lol. We exchanged numbers and they told me to keep them updated on my progress. I definitely can't quit now -- i got the whole world holding me accountable! lolI had to walk knee deep across Little Antietam Creek today, which was pretty exciting. The current was pretty strong because of the rain and i felt pretty top-heavy with all the extra weight on my back. At first I wasn't concerned because everything important in my pack is in a ziploc or waterproof bag. It wasn't until I was halfway across the creek that i realized that my phone was in my bra. lol So if i went down, my phone was definitely going with me. Luckily i made it out!The climb up to the shelter was insane. I was drenched in sweat when i finally made it to my tenting sight. I ran into two other girls my age who also just started in Harpers Ferry. There's way more people out here flipflopping than i expected to meet.Just so y'all know, I thought I'd breakdown my daily diet for you. The hiker diet isn't that glorious, and besides the instant packets of tuna and spam everyone out here has, it's not too hard to do it vegan. Breakfast: granola bars/ trail mixLunch: pb & jelly on flour tortillas Snack: vegan jerky (mailing to myself), seeds & nutsDinner: plain Ramen noodles with teriyaki sauce and dehydrated veggiesThis will pretty much be what i eat consistently everyday for the next 6 months, with slight variations every now and then depending on my resupplying options in towns and stuff.","Pine Knob Shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591787,"First dry day! Yay!Passed over the mason-dixon line, separating Maryland and Pensalvania!Saw some wildlife today, two black snakes! One was about 4 and a half feet long and was slithering down a creek over some wet rocks while i was washing my shorts and socks. lolThe Tumbling Run shelter im at tonight is super nice compared to what i've seen so far. Their tenting sights are graveled, so no sleeping on mud! Finally able to lay out my wet tent and clothes to dry. Mildew is starting to grow on the inside of my inflatable sleeping pad which smells real nice. As I set up my tent though i realize that i left my tenting spikes in the damn ground at the last shelter... Stupid!! So i make-do with rocks and sticks. I met a trail-runner at the shelter named Birchie who helps oversee a 50ish mile part of the trail. He's quite the character. He looks over my schedule for the next 7 days and basically changes everything. He directs me to better towns, better water sources, and better post office locations than what i had originally planned. A little overwhelming, but super helpful. The night ends with me, Birchie, and a group of 4 guys here from England sitting around a campfire while one of them sings and plays a miniature guitar he's carrying with him all the way to Maine lol!","Raven Rock Shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592485,"Today was pretty hot and rocky. The one thing i miss about the rain is that it kept all the bugs at bay. Now i just have a permanent family of gnats that circle my head wherever i go lol. 
I did my first resupply in South Mountain, PA. At least i think that's what it's called. I walked a mile off trail to a hiker-friendly diner called Timbers. In the guide book it said they had a charging station and desperately needed to charge up my electronics. I wasn't planning on eating there, but when i walked in the husband instantly handed me a menu and the wife got me a table. It dawned on me that obviously i was gonna have to spend money there in order to charge my phone -- which i was stupid to assume otherwise. The menu is chalk-full of hardy, meaty, cheesy items that i'm sure the average thru-hikers drool over. I desperately scan the menu for a house salad, maybe soup, anything remotely vegetarian -- nothing existed. So i swallowed my pride and got one pancake with a side of fries. The wife looked at me weird when i told her that's all i wanted. Most hikers that come through there order 3 meals for one person and here i am getting 2 sides lol. I've never been so desperate to charge a phone battery. 
In retrospect, the couple running Timbers are two of the nicest people i've met yet. They filled up all my water jugs in their kitchen, offered me ziploc bags (which are always needed by hikers), asked me to sign their hiker register book and poster on the wall, and even watched my pack for me while i walked a mile down the road to Dollar General. Truly great people. AND went i went to pay for my bill, they said that it was already taken care of by some Trail Angels!!! Trail Angels are usually anonymous people that provide for hikers in unexpected ways. I was shocked and beyond grateful. Felt weird not being able to thank whoever it was though. 
Dollar General by the way was a jackpot. I got 5 days worth of food for less than $20. They even had those jars of peanut butter with the jelly already mixed in it, which makes life out here way easier! However, there was not an ounce of produce in sight. I just really wanted a banana or apple. I feel like fresh fruits and veggies are gonna be super hard to come by out here. I once again swallowed my pride and  settled on this mango-peach concentrate juice. 
Before dipping back into the woods, i made some of my first phone calls back to civilization. I've honestly been an emotional roller coaster since coming out here. I left behind a lot in Austin and think about it often. I just hope it's all worth it in the end.","Tumbling Run Shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592486,"We got some drizzle today, but not too bad. The rain makes everything SUPER green, which is really pretty. 
Saw a rattlesnake today! Almost stepped right on him! He was just chilling right in the middle of the trail. When i got to the campsite, I asked if others had seen it and they said yes. Seemed to have snuck up on everyone lol. 
Think i'm getting a cold. bleh. 
Don't really have a group yet, but not sure if i want one. I like hiking alone. Takes the pressure away of trying to keep pace with someone. The only downside is that it might be awhile before i get a trail name since i'm not really hanging around people long enough to get to know me lol. 
Really need to game plan a way to get a new portable phone charging system. The one i have only works when it wants too, which is barely. Not being able to regularly communicate with my ankors back home is killing me. 
My pack is killing me too. I'm kicking myself for not throwing down the monies for a nice pack. The one i have is a Gregory, which is a good brand, but it's about 8 years old so it's pretty outdated compared to the nice plushy, padded packs i'm seeing out here. Someone buy me an Osprey!! lol
I'm trying to get used to everything being very moist. Like even when it's not raining, the morning dew condenses on my tent, sleeping bag, everything really, leaving me to wake up in a nice puddle lol. 
I remanence over the times when a shower or washing machine was just a few steps away. I have know idea when a shower or laundry opportunity will come. No matter how hot it is, I wear tight leggings to bed every night so that i don't have to feel my sweat and dirt crusted legs stick together while I sleep. Just think about that one for a sec lol.","Quarry Gap Shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592487,"Nice clear day today. 
The trail passed by the famous Pine Grove General Store today. This hole-the-wall convenience store caters to hikers and is known for their Half Gallon ice cream challenge. The store is located just a dozen miles or so from the AT halfway point, so i'm celebration they challenge hikers to buy one of their half gallon tubs of ice cream and eat it all in one sitting. If you do, you get a little wooden spoon that says you're apart of the Half-Gallon Club. Not surprisingly they didn't have vegan ice cream, so i abstained lol.  
Next to the store is the AT Museum. Small, but kinda cool place. I shamelessly took advantage of their outlets to charge up while i ate one of my pb&j tortilla sandwiches on the porch lol. I also took the time to purchase a new battery charger on Amazon that'll be coming to me in two-days when i pass through town on Friday. So very excited. My mental and emotional health resides in this. 
The James Fry campsite i end up staying at with a handful of others is super nice. Right next to a creek, so gathering and filtering my water was a breeze. 
Journey Man, a section hiker in his 50s i presume, is at camp with me. He thru-hiked the AT last year and has come back this year to do little pieces of it. I've ran into him several days in a row now. He bestows a lot of confidence in me. Says i look like a seasoned hiker and that i ""got this hiking thing down"". Makes me feel like a million bucks because up until this point i've felt like a fish out of water lol. 
Since it's dry out, i decide to treat my clothes with this anti-tick spray i got. You spray it directly on all your clothes, let it dry, and then it's supposed to work as an effective deterrent for up to 30 washes. I sure hope so. One of my biggest trail fears is getting Lyme Disease, which is a real concern out here. Gotta say, checking my nether regions every night for burrowing ticks is a humbling experience. lol","Toms Run Shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592488,"Today was my least favorite day yet. It was HOT and PUDs all day (trail term for Pointless Ups and Downs). Like a goddamn roller coaster. And then to top it off, on top of one of the mountains was a giant rock maze. Like literally a maze you have to follow markings through. I was hurdling over boulders and having to take off my pack in some places to throw it down below. And guess what! I got lost in the fucking maze! I fell off trail for a solid half hour and had no idea where i was. Just in the middle of the woods. Eventually though i obviously found the trail again, but still beyond frustrating. 
After I made it out of the maze I ran into Journey Man again and vented to him about my trek there. He apparently struggled too lol. He told me that he was walking into town and getting transportation back to his car about 30 miles away. He's little trip was over. He gave me his contact info and insisted that i contact him later in my trek when i pass through Hot Springs, NC where he lives. He also reminded me that i'm doing great and to keep on trekking. So that was super nice. 
Later, the trail passed through a lot of farm lands, which absolutely sucked. Terribly hot. No shade cover. Just blazing sun and open fields. My allergies flared up the whole way through. 
The next decent shelter/campsite is like another 9 miles away or something. So my only option is to stay at this ""backpackers campsite"" right on the outskirts of Boiling Springs, PA. There's no water source here, so i had to plan ahead and pack in my water from about 4 miles away. It's also located right next to a train track. Like literally 50 ft away. And the freight train passes almost every half hour. Yay. 
I'm excited for tomorrow though! I'm resupplying at a gas station Boiling Springs, picking up a food box at the post office that i sent to myself, and also picking up my new phone charger from Amazon. Getting all the goods! 
Also, a couple guys i've been running into the passed couple days asked if i wanted to split a motel room in Carlisle, PA tomorrow night. It's about 8 miles from where i'm currently camping and only 1 mile off trail. This messes up my current schedule a little bit because i wasn't planning to stay in town or only hike 8 miles for the day. A shower, laundry, and AC for the sweet price of $20. I said yes.","James Fry Shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592489,"That fucking train dude. It ran all night except between 12-4am. 
I got my resupply box at the post office. Bumped all the snacks to a forward town and sent a lot of other stuff home. Resupplied at a gas station. They had real bananas! Whoo!! No flour tortillas though, so looks like we're doin peanut butter on hamburger buns for the next couple days. I couldn't start my 8 mile walk to Carlisle, PA right away because i was still waiting on my amazon package. I couldn't get it delivered to the post office, so i had it sent to a near by hotel. You're only really supposed to do that if you plan on staying at the hotel. Oops. 
Walking around town to do all these errands really sucks. Like i already walk enough. Since off-trail miles don't go towards the overall goal, the feel extra hard. 
The package took awhile, so i didn't start hiking till 2:00. It was only 8 miles, but it was fucking brutal. Super hot. More open farm fields. Hardly any tree cover. Suffocated in my allergies the whole way here. The only thing that kept me going was the thought of that shower. 
The room is at America's Best Value Inn. Let me tell you, the moment i walked in i regretted being there. The woods was cleaner than this place. They have wifi, but it only works in the parking lot. They have ""laundry service"" (which costs a whopping $10 a basket!), but apparently the ""laundry man"" is MIA right now and no one knows when he'll be back. So i don't think laundry will be happening. 
I take my pony tail out to shower and my hair doesn't budge. It just stays there perched up on my head. It's weird to look at myself in a mirror. I have a lot of ""eww"" and ""oh god"" thoughts. My hiker-tan is coming in strong. My face is revolting against the fact that i no longer wash it twice a day. My hips and shoulders look raw and bruised from my pack rubbing in. I thought my legs were a lot darker, but turns out it was just a thick layer of dirt built up over my calves. When i scrub the dirt off my toes, i notice that one of the nails is black and bruised. I might lose that one soon. 
Legs is scrounging for some Ibuprofen, but is out. I trade him a couple Aspirin for some much needed Benadryl. I have fun kickin it with him and Sauerkraut in the AC.

It was pretty freaking hot today. I think i only peed once all day, which isn't good lol. Less inclines, but getting really rocky. Everything is sore. 
Had my first Trail Magic experience though! A mother and daughter were posted up by a spring with ziploc baggies full of homemade chocolate chip and sugar cookies. They were giving them out to only thru-hikers! So cool!!
The other day i called The Best Friend, Keara, for the first time since being out here. We rambled a lot. She said she thought i was dead since i never called her when i said i was going too. Oops lol. She asked me a question though that i keep thinking about a lot. She asked me if i was having fun? In the moment i said ""i guess"", but it keeps coming back to me. Like what am i supposed to say? ""Yeah, i'm doing the most physically and mentally demanding challenge of a lifetime, for 180 days straight, and it's a blast!"" ... Was this ever really supposed to be fun? If it isn't fun, then what?
I don't think i ever approached this thinking it was gonna be fun. I actually really liked wearing clean underwear, showering, making smoothies, and eating out. But doing all that was really easy. Like too easy. I came out here to challenge myself. I think if i can prove to myself that i'm capable of living in the woods for 6 months and walking over 2,000 miles, well then i'll know that i can do just about anything.","Motel in Carlisle, PA

The whole camp woke up around 6am to the sound of a large tree cracking and tumbling to the forest floor. Trees and their branches falling over on people and/or their tents is a real concern out here lol. I was worried that it was about to start pouring, so i quickly gathered up my things and hit the trail. No rain yet though. 
The trail veered out of the mountains and straight through a small town, Duncanon, PA. This was convenient because i was in desperate need of more flour tortillas and baby wipes. A lot of the shops had signs in their windows saying ""hiker friendly"" or ""hiking necessities sold here"". The shitty thing about going through towns is the climb out. It kicked my ass. Midway I had to stop and bandage up a toe that's about to lose its nail. 
I officially hate hiking in Pennsylvania. I was warned of the rocky terrain, but i didn't understand how it would affect me until now. This is the first day so far, Day 11, that i feel physically destroyed. Someone please cut off my feet. There's no such thing as flat ground out here.

It rained a bit last night and was really windy. I slept terribly because i kept having a recurring nightmare of a tree falling on me in my sleep and no one able to hear me calling for help. Joy. I also woke up to about 100 ants crawling on the outside of my tent. None got inside, thankfully, but i have no idea where they came from lol. 
The post-rain air is super nice to walk through. I don't sweat as much, so it's a lot easier to stay hydrated. 
I ended up taking an earlier lunch break than expected because of some truly awesome Trail Magic. There's a road that crossed the AT today, and had a small parking lot off to the side. A family was posted up in the parking lot with two giant tables of food, waiting for thru-hikers to walk by. I was stunned. I got a banana, fruit salad, banana chips, potato chips, Oreos, and Sour Patch Kids. It was the highlight of my day. They had a lot of other stuff like hamburgers and hot dogs, but obviously i didn't eat that. They even gave out their contact info and were like if you need anything while you're in Pennsylvania call us because we can probably help. Truly incredible. 
After I gorged myself with food, i had to walk uphill for a steady 2 miles. In my previous life, i would have opted for a long nap instead lol. Eventually i come to a campsite where i see a couple guys deciding to stay there for the day. We've all already walked 13 miles today and the next campsite/shelter is another 5 miles further. I decided to push forward. 
This is the long distance i've walked so far in a day. 18 miles is a stretch already, and so in PA it's a beating. Im glad i did, but my feet are screaming. Because of that detour to the motel the other day where i showered and stayed the night, i fell off schedule a bit. So today was trying to make up for that. Today is Monday and so ill probably have to do another long day on Wednesday before i drop into town again on Thursday. Assuming my body doesn't fall apart by then lol.

Came across an awkward ""bag of Trail Magic"" today. There was a trash bag left in the middle of the trail today with a note on it for hikers. It said something like ""Northbound AT Wanders: Bag of Trail Magic for you!"" At first i was super excited. Like what a sweet thing to find. But then i opened it and realized that this was not a goodie bag designed for hikers at all.

Talked to the father today for the first time. He reminded me to not quit because i don't have anything to go back too!... thanks dad. lol
When I got to the outskirts of Hamburg, I was able to hitch a ride to the post office. It was a young guy and his dad who picked me up. I went to hop in bed of the truck because i felt too gross to ride in the cab. They told me that was illegal and laughed that i was embarrassed of my smell. They couldn't believe i'd walked almost 200 miles to get there. I'm pretty impressed with myself too lol. 
After picking up my vegan beef jerkey and other snacks from the post office, i walked to the laundry mat. A literal god send. My stuff smelled so bad. Imagine working out in the same pair of underwear for 15 days. Ya that's me guys. lol There was only one other person doing laundry there, an old lady. It was awkward because i was trying to take off the clothes i was currently wearing so they could be washed as well. I temporarily switched into my rain suit instead. But in the process, an arm slipped and i flashed a boob at her. lol I think she thought i was a runaway or something. Especially after watching me wash my face in the laundry sink tub.
After that i walked across the street to Dollar General. Another 6 days worth of food for a sweet $18! Chick-ching! I even splurged and bought Oreos. 
Soon i realized that i was way further into town than i had planned. The campsite i needed to get to was on the outskirts about 4 miles from DG. ipulled out the trail guide book to see if there were any hiker-shuttle services in the area. A lot of trail towns have then. I called the only one listed but they didn't answer. I started to mentally prepare myself to lug my freshly-loaded pack halfway across town, walking off-trail miles that don't count, but then i saw in the book the Port Clinton Barber Shop - ""very hiker friendly"" it said. So i called them! The owner answered and after i told him who/what i was, he was like ""You need a ride? Paul, get your ass up and go pick up this girl. I promise he's not a rapist or axe murder. He'll be there in 20 minutes!"" And just like that i got a FREE ride!! Paul takes me to the barber shop and i get to meet the owner. Super bummed i can't remember his name, but the guy was legit. It's like a barber shop/antique store. He offered me cookies, candy, donuts. Told me all the best places in town to eat at and such. Quite the chatter box. The whole time he was talking to me he was cutting a man's hair. But he couldn't talk and cut hair at the same time. So this man keeps looking at me. Finally he's like ""If you don't stop asking him questions, i'll be here all night!"" lol! We all laughed. 
There's a ""Hiker's Pavillon"" on the outskirts of town. It's like a giant awning where hikers are loud to sleep and hang out at. There's a handful of other hikers here tonight. Some familiar faces, some new. I keep to myself mostly. Everyone has there sleeping bags laid out in different areas of the platform. I'm not one with nature enough to sleep without my tent, so i set it up under the pavilion in the corner. This will be my first night sleeping in such close corridors with other people though, something i try and avoid often. Wish me luck!","Eagle Nest Shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593298,"Barely slept at all last night. Sleeping close to other people is awful. People were getting up in the middle of the night, snoring, farting, everything. Also, the pavilion was located between a railroad station and a highway, so there's that. 
The climb out of Port Clinton was a bitch. My pack was stuffed to to the brim with food from my resupply, so like 5-7 pounds heavier than the day before. Maybe more honestly, i'm just guessing. 
I busted my ass hard on some rocks. I can't say it enough, the terrain here is SO rocky. I try and take my time when going over the big rocks because they're usually slippery and slanted. I couldn't have been going any slower though. One of my feet slipped and i tried to catch myself with my trekking poles but there was no ground to stick them into, so my backpack just pushed me down hard into a crevice between two rocks. I laid there for a bit and was scared to move because i couldn't tell what the damage was. I wiggled my toes, then my ankles, and then my knees. Nothing felt sprained thankfully! My right knee broke my fall, so now i got a lot of scrapes and bruises on my legs. It's frustrating how easy it can be to hurt yourself out here even when you're being super careful. Like just one bad step and this whole thing could be over. Stupid. 
 I hit my 200 mile marker today! So that was cool. However, watching the NoBos (North-bounders from Georgia) celebrating their 1,200 mile mark also today was quite humbling lol. 
I messed up and over-shot the shelter/campsite by nearly 2 miles today. I was so pissed. I would have just set up my tent and been fine with the extra mileage i gained, but i was completely out of water and there wasn't any water source for like another 8+ miles. So the closest water was back at the shelter that i passed. When you have to walk over 2,000 miles, re-walking even a step is enough to push someone over the edge. So tomorrow i get to start my morning by re-walking 1.5 miles of trail for the 3rd time! So stoked. 
I will say though, the Eckville shelter is pretty badass. It's located 0.2 miles off trail down a road that intersects with the trail (hence why i missed it). It's literally someone's house though! They converted their property to serve hikers. The barn is the shelter and has bunks. The backyard is big, freshly mowed, and has raised tenting platforms. They have a water spigot for drinking, a hose for rinsing off gear, flushable out-house, AND - wait for it - a rain-barrel shower system! I took a shower. But i didn't have any soap and just realized i lost my hairbrush, so there's that.","Port Clinton Hiker's Pavillon

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593299,"Started hiking at 8am today, and by 9am i was dehydrated and completely drenched in sweat. It was about a 3 mile hike on trail from the shelter back up to the mountain ridge. Over 1,000 ft elevation change. But luckily that was the hardest part of today's hike. Besides the rocks of course lol. 
After about 8 miles i stopped at a shelter/camp to have lunch. A couple other hikers were there -- also complaining about the rocks and their feet lol. Even previous hikers left complaints about the terrain in the trail register. Every major shelter and/or campsite on the AT has a register/log for you to sign in on. It's literally just a spiral notebook and pen in a ziploc bag. People leave notes in them with the date they were there. I sign them when i remember to. It's cool to flip through it and recognize names from people i met over a week ago. 
I heard about this B&B/restaurant 0.2 miles down a road that intersects with the trail. So i planned to check it out for dinner. You won't believe what they had. SALADS. I hung out there for nearly 2 hours in the blissful AC. Washed my face and arms in the bathroom. Got a house salad, fried pickles, and a sweat tea. I felt like a new person. 
After that, the campsite was just another hour walk on trail. Tonight is the first night i'm camping at a site that is not located near an official AT shelter. This usually just means that the water source will be further and harder to get too (it did not disappoint) and ill be alone (which i am). The next shelter is another 4 miles away, which i could have pushed for but then i'd be ahead of my schedule and that didn't feel necessary. So here i stay. The campsite is pretty nice though. It's located near a power line with a big view from the top of the mountain. There's a storm coming in quick though, so gotta put up the rainfly and hunker down for the night.","Eckville Shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593300,"It ended up not raining at all last night. I woke up to a lot of wind and the sound of thunder in the distance, but no rain yet. The breeze and overcast was heaven. I started hitting the boulders at 9am. I had both my trekking poles idle in my left hand, two breakfast bars in my right, my headphones on The Gorillaz, and i was mountain-goatin right over those rocks. For the first time day i felt really confident in what i was doing. Like i was finally in my element. 
Also, it's amazing what good hiking conditions will do to your mood. Because of the cool weather, i didn't break a sweat all day. And i didn't see one freaking gnat! Amazing. 
Had some out-of-this-world trail magic today. The first one happened on trail soon after my lunch break. There was a cooler left along the trail in the middle of the woods full of Pepsi and Ginger Ale laid over ice blocks with a note to thru-hikers saying ""Happy Trail Magic!"". I was stunned. I never drink sodas, like ever. But something inside me felt entitled to that soda, so i sipped on some Ginger Ale for the next half hour while i hiked. 
Later in the afternoon when i reached the shelter, a woman walked up right as i did but from the opposite direction. She asked me if i was thru-hiking and i said yes. And then she said ""Well, this is your lucky day"" and pulls out a big bag of oranges from her day pack. Real produce, god bless. She introduced herself as the caretaker of that shelter and the next 5 miles of trail north. I can't remember her name though (i know, i'm terrible at that). We talked a lot about the trail, her plans to thru-hike after retirement, her 10 rescue cats, her many hobbies, and more. She was the bomb. 
Since she was just stopping by to check on the shelter, she offered to pack-out my trash. Since there's no trash cans on the trail, everyone has to pack-out all the trash they accumulate. And if you only resupply about every 5 days like me, then you're usually carrying 5 days worth of food wrappers and baby wipes. Yum. I was super grateful. 
Before she left, we started talking about hiking gear and all the great backpacks out there. She was telling me how much she loved her Osprey pack and how comfortable it is (this is the one i've been dreaming about since i got out here). I agreed with her and told her if there was an REI near the trail (which there isn't) i would buy one in a heartbeat. And then she gave me her phone number and told me to call her in a couple days when i was passing through town and she could pick me up and drive me an HOUR AND A HALF AWAY TO GO BUY A NEW PACK! SAY WHAT! I was so shocked. Like why, you don't know me lady lol. Since when are people this nice?! I'm not completely sure yet if i'm gonna take her up on the offer. Like i probably should. This opportunity isn't gonna come again, so it's now or never basically. But damn, crazy luck.

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593301,"Today was a day. It started out with a pretty grueling climb that had quite the reputation. It was definitely the most risky climb i've encountered yet. On the way up the mountain i saw an older guy i recognized. I asked him why he was headed the opposite direction. He just looked at me and said ""No way in hell. Can't do it"". I was just thinking fuuucccckkkk what. 
There were parts where i was literally using my hands and arms to pull myself over rocks. I couldn't look down because i knew i'd freeze and be stuck. I had to keep reminding myself not to lean back, otherwise my pack would take me down over a drop. I kept thinking to myself, what would my dad say if he saw me hiking this?? Nothing good, i decided lol. I'm just following the blazes, folks. 
Another trail magic snag!! There was another cooler. This time full of Cokes and water jugs. Water has started to run scarce in this section of PA. There's few springs, far in between, and most run the risk of drying out. Thus i've found myself rationing my water throughout the day. SO, to see these jugs of fresh, filtered water was a GREAT surprise. And since there was already a group of hikers gathered around all drinking the cokes, I felt pretty inclined to have one as well. The only thing missing from these Soda Magics the past couple days is some Jameson and ice. But, here's to sober hiking. Cheers!
It's weird being surrounded by so many NoBos. I feel like that weird transfer kid that shows up halfway through the semester and everyone's like who the fuck are you? lol. Like i'm doing the same trail they are, but they already have over a thousand miles under them. Feel like i can't call myself a thru-hiker yet just because i don't have enough street-cred , you know. Weird. 
Since it rained a lot last night, i saw tons of little baby salamanders. I don't know if i've mentioned them before, but they're these little bright orange spotted newts. Just babies. Chillin in the middle of the trail. After moving the 8th salamander off trail, i gave up. They're everywhere. Suicide Salamanders i call them. 
While i was eating lunch on a rock, i heard a near by russle coming from underneath a rock across from me. I stayed super still, expecting a giant ass rat snake to come slithering out. Instead it was this wee little mouse. He kept going in and out gathering foliage to take back in his hole with him. So cute. 
Today was nearly a 17 mile day. i'm starting to notice that on days where i hike over 13 or 14, those last couple miles are so damn long. By that time, i'm out of stuff to listen to and stuff to think about, so i'm just stuck in my head for like 2 hours. It becomes a purely mental hike and it sucks. 
At the shelter/campsite tonight there are a lot of us, all spread out. Probably over a dozen. So many names - Skywalker, Robo, Wolf Pack, Granite Man, Blood Beard, Wood Chuck, and more. Granite Man is this old, retired chainsmoker guy. I kept passing him on trail today every time he stoped for a smoke break. Later, I noticed all these patches on the side of his tent. I asked what happened and he said sometimes he smokes inside his tent and bumps into the walls and burns holes in them LOL. 
I spent most of the evening talking with Blood Beard and Wood Chuck after they lured me out of my tent, where i usually go to hide for the evening lol. Blood Beard tells me that he's actually super introverted, like me. He warns me though, that you can't be a complete hermit on trail otherwise you'll go crazy.

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593302,"Perfect hiking weather today. Lotta rocks, but only one steep incline. Since i'm not too far from town, i had good signal on my phone and got to talk to people for half the day while i hiked. That helped SO much. 
I'm camping at the best spot yet! There's a clearing on the mountain about half a mile past the shelter. It's sometimes used as a hang-gliding jump pad. I set my tent up right on the edge of it. You can see the circumference of the earth! lol First time camping with a view and it's awesome. 
Wolf Pack, a woman i keep crossing paths with, came by and set her tent up next to me. She's also a flip-flopper and started in Harper Ferry 10 days before me. She's impressed with my speed. We made our dinner together and talked a bunch of mess, like how we've started to become so accustomed to our own filth, and what it's like to be the ""newbies"" on trail, etc. So much easier to relate to other flip-floppers because we're all going through the same stuff and having similar thoughts. We're both resupplying in town tomorrow and i'm stoked. She talked about getting an avocado at a Walmart about a week ago and now i'm determined to find one.

I was given a name about a week ago, but didn't wanna say anything because i wasn't sure if it was going to stick. The name is V! Like the movie ""V for Vendetta"".

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593306,"DUDE! GUESS WHAT I SAW!
This morning i got up quickly, got my stuff together, and was on the trail by 8am. I was eating a pb&j sandwich for breakfast while i walked. I was pretty pumped because i only had a 6 mile walk on trail until i hit my resupply town, Delaware Water Gap, PA. AND today was the day i was supposed to meet up with that awesome lady, Jenna, who was gonna give me a ride to REI. So i was cruising!
I heard a russell in the bushes, turned my head, and saw 2 squirrels run away. No biggie. Looked back to the trail and no more than 30 ft in front of me was this giant black bear! He had his nose in the ground, brushing leaves aside, sniffing around. I didn't really know what to do, so i just stood there lol. I looked around to see if there were cubs and there wasn't, so i didn't feel too intimidated. The bear eventually looked up and saw me, paused for a second, and then turned around and sprinted away lol. CRAZY!
While i was hiking into town I ran into Twister. I met him about 6 days ago back in Port Clinton. I was surprised to see him because i knew he took 2 days off over the weekend. Yet, here he is! These NoBos catch up fast!!
I got into town earlier than i expected, so after picking up my snacks at the post office, i stopped at the Church of the Mountain hostel. Super cool place!! You can shower, hang out, sleep in the bunk room, or tent outside. Donations encouraged, but it's basically FREE! And they even had soap and towels for your shower, AMAZING!
Jenna picked me up around noon to go to REI. I wish i could accurately describe her. Saying she was the coolest person ever just doesn't do her justice. She literally does everything. Works for a construction company, has 10 rescue cats, collects german sport cars, hunts and hikes, volunteers as an AT trail maintainer, local emergency responder, and working with a lawyer and local animal rights activists to shut down an abusive shelter. LIKE EVERYTHING! 
I got my new fancy Osprey pack, which fits like a glove! A complete game changer!!! Jenna bought me a weather pack cover, gave me her own pair of gaiters (something i really needed), and some tent spikes (since i lost all mine)!! A true godsend of a woman. The community of people out here that support AT hikers continues to surprise me everyday. 
After she dropped me off back in town, I walked to some gas stations to resupply and found a veggie burger at a local diner! Score! Later, a group of hikers (torino, webster, scar, shortcut, and legs) all invited me to go hang at a bar with them. Scar kept buying rounds of tequila shots. We were lit lol! Gotta climb out of town and do nearly 17 miles tomorrow, so wish me luck! hahaI'll post more on Sunday 6/10!","Krikridge Campsite

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593573,"Last night i tented in the backyard of the hostel. Since there was overflow from the bunks, several people laid out their sleeping bags on the front porch. Apparently in the middle of the night, a black bear was walking around on the front porch, smelling people's food bags hanging from the rafters. Walking right past people on the floor! Crazy! Meanwhile, I'm tenting in the back with all my food spread out right next to me lol. Oops. 
I got a super late start today. Didn't hit the trail until almost 11am lol. Since i goofed off last night, i spent this morning uploading my journals online and downloading a bunch of podcasts to my phone to get me through the next couple days. 
While walking out of town, i crossed a big bridge separating Pennsylvania and New Jersey. It feels great to officially be done with PA. The trail runs through NJ for about 70 miles, so i expect to be here for about 5 days. 
Just a couple hours into my hike I meet an older guy named ""Solo"" passing out small bags of chips and crackers to thru-hikers. Trail magic! I sit and chat with him for a bit. He tells me that he hiked the PCT (Pacific Crest Trail) last year. It's another giant trail that goes from north to south along the west coast. He spends the next 20 mins trying to convince me to make the PCT my next big adventure lol. We'll see. One trail at a time!
My new pack is pretty sweet. I love everything about it, but it'll definitely take some time to get used to it. It puts the majority of the weight on my hips (like it's supposed too), so i can really feel my legs carrying my pack. Today was the first time my quads actually burned going uphill. Thunder thighs here we come! lol
Including the super late start, i actually fucked up a lot today lol. i collected water from a swamp accidentally instead of a stream, so i had to treat all my water with my emergency iodine pills. Then i overshot the campsite by a mile and couldn't turn around and back-track because i was running out of daylight. So i'm stealth tenting now in some random brush, which is illegal in NJ because of all the bears. Also, i didn't realize that my socks were hording small bits of gravel within the fibers, so the bottom of my toes and feet look like someone took a razor blade to them. And now, as i'm writing this, i can hear a bear breathing heavily running down the ridge line right past my tent! lol

I already ate dinner and still feel starving. I've drank over 3 liters of water and feel super dehydrated. It wasn't even that hot today and i didn't even do an insane amount of mileage...
My feet are so fucked up. Little bits of sand and gravel are tearing up my toes and pads on my feet. I got gaiters to fix this, but somehow it's still happening. I even used a clean, spare set of hiking socks today because i feel like my other ones have sand stuck between the threads. But these ones are doing the same thing! I've taken the soles out of my boots and beaten the crap out of them. I don't know what else to do. A couple more days of this and i'm gonna have open sores all over my feet. 
I overshot the shelter/campsite AGAIN, i think. It might be a little further ahead or behind me. I have no idea. So i'm stealth camping again.

I spent 20 mins this morning wrapping my feet up in ductape and blister bandages. Within 20 mins of hiking i could feel all the bandages rolled up in a ball at the front of my shoes. Cool. 
I was right by the way. I overshot yesterday's campsite by nearly a mile. Since i'm use to hiking 2 miles an hour, i use that to estimate what time i'll reach certain locations. But since the terrain is much nicer in NJ then PA, i'm actually averaging 2.5 mph. Today i even did 3 mph at one point. It was awesome. It allows you to do so much more with your time besides hiking.  
I was listening to a cool podcast yesterday on the Joe Rogan Experience and it covered a lot of stuff. But a cool take-away was how important it is to break-up your routine and challenge yourself. This guy was saying how there's 365 days in a year. So out of those 365 days, we should AT LEAST spend ONE day pushing our limits to the max, making ourselves super uncomfortable, challenging ourselves SO hard to the point that that ONE day drastically influences how we live the next 364. I thought that was such a neat concept. And i just happen to be doing 180 days of that lol. 
Mosquitoes and gnats have been bad. I love it when i'm hiking and i inhale a gnat and it gets stuck to the back of my esophagus and i have to gag it out. Almost every square inch of my legs has a bug bite. If i don't get Zika or West Nile, I'll definitely probably grow a third appendage from bathing in deet 2-3 times a day lol. 
I ran into a woman day-hiker today about my age. As we were about to cross paths, she puts her arms out and hugs me lol. She said i was the first female thru-hiker she'd seen all morning. I told her that ya the ratio of women to men is about 1-4. She wanted me to elaborate on what that was like and i honestly haven't given it much thought so i didn't know what to say lol. But apparently it's a thing. I will say though that there is something about being a woman, vegan hiker with zero backpacking experience that fuels me, makes me feel like i have a point to prove! lol
Hiker hunger is starting to set in strong. I go to bed hungry and wake up hungry. I feel like i physically can't eat enough food these past couple of days. Back at the hostel i had stayed at, they had a scale for hikers to weigh themselves. I've already lost 5 lbs! I didn't really come out here with a lot of weight to lose, you know. I'm not complaining, but if i lose another 5 lbs i'll be the same weight i was my sophomore year of high school! I hope i gain some muscle mass to replace this weight. i'm not trying to walk out of here a skeleton. lol
Today was actually a pretty sweet day. I hiked a lot, chilled a lot, and hung out with other hikers all day. You'd be proud. I heard a rumor that this state park head quarters place along the trail gave out free sodas to thru-hikers, so i stopped by there and ran into Legs, Sauerkraut, Skywalker and two new people, Turmoil and Mongrel. We all sat in the front lawn drinking our free Pepsi and eating our hiker lunches. 
Then we saw in the guidebook that there was a lake near by about half a mile off trail with a consessions stand that sold FOOD. So we finished our lunches and booked it to this lake for our second lunch. Everyone gorged themselves on burgers and hotdogs. I ate an apple, a pretzel, Oreos, 2 fruit roll-ups, and a snow cone. It was great!! We hung out there for several hours. I don't know what it is about being in the woods for weeks that makes people so vulgar and obscene, but these guys were talking about the grossest, most inappropriate shit my virgin ears have ever heard of lol! There were families and children everywhere, but absolutely no sensors. It was terrible, but i've also never laughed so much. 
After that, we all set out on the trail again. Legs and Sauerkraut raced ahead and disappeared. Turmoil and Mongrel lagged behind. So me and Skywalker ended up chatting and hiking together. I had only planned for today to be a 13 mile day, but we reached the High Point shelter/campsite at 6pm and Skywalker was gonna keep going so i decided to follow. This was my first time actually hiking with somebody and WOW it makes it all go by so much faster. Ended up doing another 4 miles together and stealth camping next to a stream. Which, by the way, i learned today that stealth camping is illegal in NJ, but NOT for thru-hikers. We are the exception! Whoo!
Since i picked up some extra mileage today, i have a much shorter hike tomorrow into town to resupply. So hopefully i can get in early, get what i need, and get out quick without being sucked into all the temptations!","stealth camping

I stopped at Horler's General Store and picked up 4 days worth of food and snacks. Before i walked in the store, i ate 3 peanut butter sandwiches because you don't wanna grocery shop hungry. It didn't help. I ended up buying a bunch of stuff and eating half of it on the front porch. 
The hike overall today was really nice. At one point, the trail went for about a mile between two giant ponds/swamps that are a designated nature/bird preserve. There were swarms of dragonflies everywhere. About 100 circled me the whole way through. Luckily i like dragonflies lol. 
I need to stretch my calves more. I don't know why, but they just recently started turning into bricks. Sore bricks. It hurts to move. 
I saw in the guidebook that the trail was going to pass a country road later in the day and that there was a place called Heaven Hill Farm only 0.1 west. Anytime something is only 0.1 miles off trail, you always go check it out. It sounded like a farmers market kinda place and i really wanted some fruit with my dinner... SO glad i went!! I got an orange, a quinoa salad, a VEGAN BLT sandwich, and 2 VEGAN banana chocolate chip muffins!!! FIRST vegan dessert and sandwich i've seen on trail. It was AMAZING!
From the farm, you could see the trail ahead and it was practically vertical lol. I kinda regretted gorging myself right before that mile climb, but better to eat it then carry it, i say. 
I need to do laundry soon. But laundry mats are never close to the trail. And hitching is illegal in NY, so there's that. Hostels/Motels usually have laundry, but then you gotta pay to stay there and that's stupid. I've only washed my clothes once since coming out here. They don't just smell bad, but like sour. The only time i really notice it is right when i wake up in the morning. Overnight my tent becomes a hot-box of smells, fermented mildew essentially. Yum lol.","stealth camping

I was scared to turn on my headlamp because i wasn't sure what i was gonna find. Once i ruled out snakes and opossums and decided it was probably just a mouse, i turned on the light and started slowly moving everything in my tent around. Eventually i see the tent floor move. And then move again! Turns out, i set up my tent on top of a small mouse hole. That mouse was running around right underneath my back all night long lol. 
My hike started out really strong this morning. Did 7 miles in 3 hours. After lunch though it was all downhill (not the terrain, my attitude lol). All i wanted to do was nap, but setting up everything needed to nap comfortably sounded like a lot of work. So i hiked on. 
The trail went over some stupid big rocks. Not like a couple rocks, but like 2 miles of boulders. My ankles are feeling it. I climbed up one rock today only to see a bear climbing up the same rock on the other side! He didn't seem very startled by me, so i quickly scrambled back down. I made a bunch of noise on the rocks with my trekking poles and within minutes he moved on. 
This morning, i met an older guy section-hiking the trail headed south. He told me he was glad that this was his last day in New York. He said that the trail ahead turns into a mad rollercoaster with lots of PUDs. As if i already wasn't super pumped for tomorrow's hike... now i know it's brutal. Thanks. 
Same guy also told me about this famous ice cream shop coming up on a road crossing, only 0.3 miles off trail. He insisted that i go check it out. I smiled and nodded, but we all know i don't give two fucks. And then a different guy later in the afternoon gives me the same spiel! And then two other hikers i run into say they're headed for the ice cream and tell me i should join. And i'm just thinking if one more god damn person tells me about this slavery-made, hormone-induced, country-ass ice cream i'm gonna fucking lose it. 
The other day when i hiked a couple miles with Skywalker, he kept mentioning how much he LOVED hiking. After the third time, i told him to shut the fuck up because it really kinda pissed me off lol. I kept thinking about that today.. I don't think i'd ever drop the L bomb when describing my relationship with hiking. I hope that by the end of all this i can say that hiking is something i really enjoy. But i don't know right now, too soon to tell. 
In case you were wondering, my feet have gotten worse, much worse! They survived yesterday pretty well, mainly because i stopped several times to shake out my shoes and socks. I didn't do that today though because i'm stupid and now i'm paying for it - bad! I'm gonna try to figure out how to upload a picture of my feet because someone needs to see this! I cleaned the bottom of my feet with alcohol swabs and put anti-bacterial ointment on them. Right now, they hurt to the touch. A lot. I'm hoping they scab up a little by morning. Tomorrow should be interesting.","stealth camping

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594079,"Today was a day. 
I started hiking kinda late, 9:30am. I was the last one to leave the campsite. Mornings are always pretty slow. I feel like a newborn fawn whenever i take my first steps out of my tent. My ankles feel like glass and the arches of my feet are super tight. 
By noon i had already stopped 4 times to tend to the sores on my feet. I was beyond frustrated. I have this theory now that it's not actually sand/sediment that i'm feeling in my socks, but rather SALT. Since i haven't done laundry in nearly 2 weeks, my socks are stiff as a board, so that's what's probably tearing up my feet. I won't have a good opportunity to do laundry until Monday (a week from now), so i'm gonna try and rinse one pair of my socks in a stream tomorrow. I don't really care about the pain or discomfort of it all. I'm just really paranoid about getting some crazy skin infection that forces me to a doctor. 
I felt super discouraged all day. The trail was hard. I didn't even do an insane amount of miles, but i literally spent the whole day hiking. The other day i was starting to think that my ""hiker stride"" was setting in, but then New York happened. I keep looking at the elevation chart for tomorrow and the rest of the week and it doesn't seem to get any better. I have a nearly 18 mile day planned for tomorrow. Kill me. 
I like hiking alone, but not having someone to bitch about the trail with at the end of the day makes all of this a little harder. Any ""friends"" that i have made are all NoBos, so they're already 2-4 days ahead of me. It's so frustrating that i can't keep up with them yet.
I'm stealth camping again. This time on top of a mountain with a view of the sunset. I'm definitely not supposed to be camping here, but i doubt anyone is gonna climb all the way up here to tell me otherwise lol.","Wildcat Shelter
",stealth camping,"Jun 12, Tue",14.30
V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594401,"Since i had a nearly 18 mile day planned, i made sure i was on trail by 7:30am. I tried really hard to start off with a better attitude. Yesterday was hot and sunny, but today was a bliss overcast all day. Super nice. Got to see the NYC skyline from several different mountain tops!
There's this lady i keep running into occasionally who is also flip-flopping from Harpers Ferry. We haven't exchanged names yet, but we keep leap-frogging each other on the trail. I saw her on top of a mountain this morning and she talked about wanting to stay in town, but all the rooms were pricey so she wished she had someone to split one with, hint hint lol. I told her i avoid that temptation as much as possible and that i've only split one motel room since coming out here. She gave me a confused face and then asked ""So where do you stay?"". To which i replied ""The woods?"" lol. I probably sounded insulting, but it seemed like such a weird question. Apparently, she tries to stay in town at least once or twice a week in order to shower, do laundry, and resupply. That just sounds like a lot of money to me. To the woods i go!
I've been on like an 80% granola diet since my last resupply. The corner store i had stopped at the other day didn't have any good trail mixes. So instead of buying a mix of nuts, seeds, and dried fruit, i just bought a shit ton of granolas and granola bars. Really filling, but after lunch time my energy levels have just been plummeting. My body feels like mashed potatoes and becomes physically worthless. 
Today's hike was just as hard as yesterday's, but i keep trying to tell myself that if i got through the last 27 days then i can definitely do today. This will be a reoccurring mantra. I had some proud moments today though, like when i hiked this steep incline for like 45 mins and didn't have to stop for a break or water. My gluteus were on fire! lol What really sucks though is climbing to the top of these mountains, feeling like you just conquered the world, and then busting out the map and realizing that your mountain is just a tiny speed bump on the elevation chart. Like a small rock one could possibly trip over. Stupid lol.
I made a terrible mistake though... I looked ahead on the elevation charts. lol I skipped ahead to Vermont and New Hampshire and good god i'm screwed. What i consider a mountain now, really will just be a speed bump compared to what lies ahead. My 30 min inclines are gonna turn into 5 hrs. It's terrifying honestly. I can't think about it. 
The trail went through a park today with a lake. I got so excited when i saw vending machines. I got chips, a popsicle, and a Snapple! After the park, the trail leads you across this big bridge/highway to go over the lake. This was probably just some normal interstate bridge, but to me it was massive. It had all the big cross-wire bars and stuff, like the bridges in the movies! lol. It was around rush hour, so the bridge was pretty backed up. It felt kinda surreal to be walking through it. So civilized. Some people honked and waived. Meanwhile, i just couldn't help but smile and think ""All you slums are sitting in rush hour traffic and i'm fucking walking to Maine dude!!""","stealth camping

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594402,"Got started pretty early today, 7:30am. I knew the trail was gonna run into a road crossing with a gas station, so i made plans to resupply there. Besides being way over priced ($60 for 3 days of food), it had a lot of hiker stuff and a deli! I had a second breakfast involving 2 bagels, an apple, a banana, and mango juice! And they even had these Lenny & Larry vegan protein cookies that are usually a rare find! A bought a ton lol. 
About 2 miles into my hike, i regretted everything i bought. My pack is SO heavy. It's literally a never ending cycle. 
Feet Update: they're healing! I washed one pair of socks in a stream 2 days ago and hung them on the outside of my pack. I think they'll be finished drying by tomorrow, so then i should have one pair of salt-free socks. For the pair i've been wearing, i've just been dumping loads of baby powder in them in the morning (thanks taylor!) and it kinda works like a fabric softener and also protects my feet. So that's been a game changer. 
Camping at a state park tonight and they have showers! I didn't have any soap though, so i just planned to rinse off. But someone left behind their Suave shampoo! Feels so good to be clean. And guess what else i found, the whole gang! I strolled in around 5:00 only to find Skywalker, Rodo, Baby Face, Zoltan, and Caveman all hanging out. I met several of these guys at the church hostel a week ago. Thought they were all light years ahead of me, but here they are! The state park was only supposed to be a pitstop for them, but they ended up hanging out here longer than expected so they're staying the night. Nice to be in good company. They're planning to go 21 miles tomorrow though, so ill probably lose them again. It's tempting to wanna keep up, but i don't know. I only planned to do 14 tomorrow and right now that sounds pretty great. But we'll see. 
I was thinking a lot today about my post-trail life and what it's gonna feel like to have completed this whole thing. I think out of all the things on my resume, this is gonna be the most impressive. Like a college degree is good and all, but everyone has that. Honestly, graduating college never felt like a big deal to me. It was just something that was decided for me way before i was even born, and i just followed through. Just a check mark of completion on life's big to-do-list. This is different though. No one is telling me to be out here. And not everyone does this. It's a huge challenge that i just chose to do. I think talking about my trail experience during any future interview is gonna be a much better selling point than my degree. For sure.","Hemlock Springs campsite

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595109,"Hit mile 400 today! Spent most of the day hanging with the gang which was interesting (who refer to themselves at ""The Trailer Park Boys""). I learned that out of the 5 of them, one has their dick pierced and another guy is uncircumcised... i appreciate the fact that none of them treat me like i'm the only girl tagging along, but i definitely didn't need to know this lol. 
There was a freak tornado in NY not to long along that did some crazy forest damage. So all day we were hoping over huge blowdowns throughout the trail. 
I learned recently that Legs had to hop off the trail a couple days back. He was running out of money, so he's going home to work for 2 weeks and then come back. He'll be way behind us by the time he gets back, so no real chance of running into him again. 
The gang was going 0.5 off trail to a deli for lunch. I hadn't planned to go because i was skeptical of the veggie options they would have, but so glad i did! I looked at their menu board and couldn't find anything, so i asked the girl at the counter if she could help me out. She made me a custom, foot-long eggplant cutlet sandwich loaded with veggies and balsamic dressing. It was the bomb.com
The deli was also a convenient store, so we all loaded up on chips, candy, and drinks. We ran into a guy named Chip n' Dale who i had only met briefly on trail a couple days ago. They all knew each other well. Chip n' Dale was waiting in the parking lot for his parents to pick him up to go to their family reunion for the weekend. Since he wasn't hiking at all today, he kept trying to encourage all of us to shotgun a beer before getting back to the trail. Before you know it, we're all huddled up behind this store, everyone with TWO beers in hand. I abstained of course. Hiking is hard enough - i don't need the added bonus of being drunk! lol It was the stupidest most ridiculous thing i've ever seen, but of course i got it all on video lol. With everyone blitzed by 2pm, the rest of the day's hike was super entertaining to say the least. 
The next shelter we passed was the Morgan Stewart shelter. This is where i had planned to stay the night and conclude my 14 mile day. But everyone else was pushing on to the Telephone Pioneers shelter, another 8 miles! They kept telling me that i could do it, but I've never walked over 20 miles in one day. But i also didn't wanna be left behind. So i caved and kept walking.
I didn't make it lol. I walked another 4 miles and was done. Most of the group was way up ahead already, but Skywalker (the beer-shotgun contest winner) was lagging behind lol. He also was in no shape to walk the last 4 miles, so we decided to stealth camp together. He probably could have made that last 4 miles, but i think he partly didn't wanna just leave me in the dust. I don't like being dead weight, but i appreciate the company.","Clarence Fahnestock State Park

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595110,"Even though i slept terribly, i had a little bit of pep in my step today. I've been living in the woods for exactly one month now! And i just crossed out of New York and into Connecticut! I feel humbled, but confident. 
The trail crossed a road today that had a gardening/landscape store right along the trail. The guidebook said they sold a few hiker necessities and i'm officially out of stove fuel, so i stopped inside. Ran into the rest of the gang there! Wasn't expecting to see them again so soon, but they said they got a late start this morning. Not surprised lol. Skywalker was moving slow this morning too, so he's shortly behind me now. 
I was sitting on the front porch of the store chatting with Caveman and a guy named Foghorn when all of sudden i see a familiar guy walking up the driveway -- my dad! lol I knew my dad was gonna take a road trip up here to visit me, but i wasn't expecting him until Thursday and today's Saturday. Apparently, that gps tracker on my phone really works lol! The surprise was flattering, but also a bit creepy haha! He came bearing trail magic though (some watermelon and a banana!), so i was glad. 
Eventually we parted ways and i hiked on to the next shelter to stop for lunch. I ran into a girl named Twig there who i hadn't seen in nearly 300 miles! When i first met her, she had only planned to hike the state of Pennsylvania, but now she's decided to just keep walking for the rest of the summer. So that was a cool surprise. 
A woman and man, Holiday and T-Rex, eventually walked up. They were a fun duo and told us all about their trip to New York City yesterday. They had some cool trail magic happen. While on the subway, they met a young girl who told them she had thru-hiked the AT last year. The girl was so excited to meet the two hikers that she gave them this giant, homemade, VEGAN loaf of chocolate chip banana bread that she was actually on her way to deliver to her dad for Father's Day lol!! And since i had mentioned earlier to them that i was vegan, Holiday and T-Rex gave me a third of the whole loaf of bread. It was amazing!! I don't think i would have shared such great trail magic lol. 
After lunch, I hiked another 4 miles to the next shelter, which was at the bottom of the next mountain. So i made a grueling 1,000 ft hike up and then right back down the other side. The tenting area is right next to a big river. Since it's the weekend, there's plenty of people here and many swimming. 
My joints are really starting to get to me. Mainly my knees and ankles. My left knee pops with every step now. If i sit down or stand still for too long, my whole body locks up. A guy named Full Throttle sees me hobbling around camp and offers me one of his 800 mg ibuprofen -- the good stuff. Out here it's called ""Vitamin I"" because most people take it every morning with their breakfast lol. I might need to get my own bottle soon. It would definitely help me do a 20+ mile day. My other concern are these two giant blisters coming in on both of my big toes. I guess it's always something though! lol","stealth camping

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595112,"This morning i woke up to T-Rex leaving me more of the chocolate chip banana bread outside my tent. He couldn't finish his share and didn't wanna carry it anymore. So more vegan bread for me!!
That ibuprofen i took last night was a god send. Nothing hurt this morning! I left camp feeling superhuman. I was also pretty excited to drop into Kent, CT today to resupply. I saw the Trailer Park Boys walking out of town as i was headed in. They're so fast. I also saw the Brew Crew drive by in a rented car with Webster and Torino in the front seat! lol I hadn't seen them since Delaware Water Gap, PA. They rolled down their windows and said hey, but i don't know where they're headed. Nice to know that i'm ahead of them now, so we'll likely see each other on trail soon. 
Since today was Father's day, i invited my dad to meet me in town for lunch. I stopped at the laundry mat first and washed my clothes for the 2nd time since coming out here! I even washed my sleeping bag. It was great. I met another hiker there named Mastachio. He was an older guy, NoBo, and had a black mustache (obviously) lol. We both left our clothes and walked across the street to a grocery store to resupply. I saw him buying baby wipes and stopped him because i have extra i don't wanna carry. He saw me going for the ibuprofen and told me not too because he had extra. So we made a fair trade!
Dad, Jacki, and I ate lunch at an Asian food restaurant in town. I got 4 veggie sushi rolls!! Never did i think i'd get veggie sushi on trail. It was great getting to hang out and show my dad this different life i've acquired. 
After they left, I hung out with Skywalker for a bit at the laundry mat. Seemed like everyone had the same schedule for the day lol. Earlier i saw that the grocery store had my favorite Vegan Ben & Jerry's peanut butter cookie ice cream sold by the pint! So i went back and bought it and we split it! I could have definitely eaten the whole thing by myself, but hiking on a full stomach of ice cream didn't seem like the best idea. 
I spent wayyy too much time in town. A little over 5 hours lol. The climb out of town was awful, as usual. My stomach was SO full. I felt nauseous the whole way. While i was dying up the mountain, i turned around to see Skywalker behind me talking to his parents on the phone and barely breaking a sweat! SO annoying lol. I had advantageous plans of hiking another 8 miles out of town, but that definitely didn't happen. We stealth camped after 4 lol.","Ten Mile River Shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595113,"Today was fucking brutal. It was hot, like sunny all day 95 degrees hot. I hiked on and off all day with Skywalker. There were A LOT of steep inclines today that just felt like they lasted forever. I don't like trying to match Skywalker's pace going uphill, so all day i'd make him give me a head start and then we'd cross paths again a couple hours later. 
It's nice to have someone to hike with, but his upbeat attitude kills me sometimes. He's a geologist major and nature kind of guy, so all day while we're hiking he's pointing out different kinds of rocks and limestones and flowers and weeds. Usually I can patiently listen, but not today. Today i'm hot, super dehydrated, and drenched in sweat. So i tell him to shut up lol. 
The original goal for the day was to hike about 20 miles to these falls and swim at the end of the hot day. The gang was camping out at the falls, and so we wanted to catch them. We reevaluated this plan as the day went on. Every hiker we ran into looked like a zombie dying in the heat. We ended up staying at a campsite just 4 miles before the falls. A couple miles before the campsite, we both ran out of water though. And the closest water source was a spring at the campsite. We were dying. There's nothing that can motivate you to keep on hiking other than the promise of water at the end. 
The only highlight of the day was that my dad brought me a trail magic lunch at a road crossing mid day! I got a salad, juice, and some banana and apple chips! He even brought half a chicken wrap sandwich for Skywalker. Skywalker was speechless. He couldn't believe that my dad just dropped off food on his motorcycle and then sped away! lol He seemed jealous and upset that he was nearly 1,500 miles into his hike and none of his family have ever come to see him. Ya, that would be rough. I don't take the support for granite. I couldn't do this without it, for sure.","stealth camping

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595114,"Thunderstormed a lot last night, so i carried around a sopping wet tent all day. Wasn't nearly as hot today though, thankfully. Since we didn't make it to the falls yesterday, we passed by them early this morning on trail. It was a pretty sweet sight! I got my picture taken in front of it. And just moments after the picture, i slipped on a rock covered in a thick coat of algae and mud. My but and back were so gross for the rest of the morning lol. I was upset that i hadn't made it there the previous day. I know Skywalker really wanted to catch up with the guys, and i held us back. 
Knowing that the day had some nasty climbs, i tried to stay ahead of Skywalker as much as possible. I ate my lunch at the foot of this mountain that i had been preparing myself mentally for all day. It did not look pretty on the elevation map. I called it ""the three-story mountain"" because on the map it showed 3 separate inclines working their way up to the center peak lol. While i was eating, Skywalker walked up. He caught wind that the gang had just dropped off trail to a cafe about a mile down some road, so he decided to hitch a ride into town and go meet up with them. 
All of us were planning to stay at the Laurel Ridge campsite tonight, so i hiked on and figured i'd see them all later. Seems like they didn't make it though! Just me here tonight. Nice to be camping alone. Feel like i haven't done this in awhile. Sometimes at the end of a long, hard day, i don't wanna have to socialize with people. Today is one of those days. 
The mosquitoes are killing me! It's not even cold out but i'm covered in clothes neck down just to try and keep the bugs off me while i make my dinner. I'm so hungry. When I resupplied in Kent, CT the other day, i packed out 6 days worth of food because there's not another easy resupply location until Dalton, MA. Carrying 6 days worth of food is A LOT and it's heavy. So you essentially only end up buying enough food to sustain you, not necessarily appease your appetite. I usually regret all the food i bought when walking out of town, but this time I really should have packed out more.","Belter's campsite

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595115,"With no one else camping near me last night, i slept in a bit and didn't get hiking until nearly 9:30. I had three nasty climbs today and the first two were right out of camp. When i got to the top of the second climb, Mt Everett, my dad called me and said he wanted to bring me lunch again on the trail since this was the last day he was gonna be in the area. This was the best news ever. We made plans to meet at a road crossing later in the day. I was crushing all the miles in between me and our meet up spot. Good, real food is a great motivator. On the way there, i saw my first porcupine on trail! So that was cool. 
My dad didn't just bring lunch, but a hiker feast. I got a spinach and fruit salad, 4 veggie burger patties, bananas, coconut water, vegan chocolate cookies, watermelon, and a bunch of trail snacks to pack out. It was amazing. That was my 2nd salad since coming out here (thanks Jackie!). 
A guy named Smores, who i only met briefly on trail the other day, happened to walk by the picnic. My dad asked if we should offer any of the food to him. Knowing that i could eat it all myself, i said no lol. I was feeling very selfish and didn't wanna share. Nonetheless Smores got some juice and a banana. 
Later that day i ran into Smores again feasting next to this box in the middle of the woods. Someone left a trail magic snack box right on trail! It was full of cookies, candy, chips, poptarts - essentially a hiker goldmine. So we both hung out and ate a lot of chips!
I had advantageous plans to make it to this shelter after the next mountain, but considering how the day panned out i was running out of time and just feeling super tired. So i stealth camped half way up the mountain near a spring. Later i started to hear a lot of hollering coming up the mountain. I popped out of the trees only to see Skywalker and the whole gang! They were on their way to the shelter, but once they saw my set up they decided set up camp here too. 
The space i was tenting in wasn't super big, so we all were really close neighbors. Caveman, Baby Face, and Zoltan all have hammocks and me, Rodo, and Skywalker have tents. Laying in my tent, i can hear Rodo talking to his girlfriend on the phone. Actually, everyone can hear the phone conversation and we're all dying laughing. Its the sappiest shit i've ever heard! lol

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595116,"What a day guys lol. Part of me wants to sensor this entry, especially now knowing how much family is reading this. But honestly, today was iconic and this is my journal, so fuck it lol. 
The morning started with all the guys making make-shift loin clothes out of bandannas and rope! I felt really conflicted being a girl and all, yet Summer Solstice is a thru-hiker holiday and i'd be damned if i wasn't gonna participate. Don't worry, i wasn't but ass naked running through the woods with a bunch of dudes. According to Massachusetts state law, i was still covered enough to be out in public legally (the guys were definitely not though!). We'll just say i didn't leave much to the imagination haha!
Once the essentials were covered, we hit the trail! We didn't plan to hike the whole day naked, just like the first 5 or 6 miles. Luckily it was Thursday, so there weren't a lot of random day hikers out there. Those 6 miles flew by though! There's definitely an adrenaline rush involved in naked hiking lol!
I didn't wanna be seen out of context though, so i let Zoltan, Caveman, and Baby Face hike on in front of me. Meanwhile, Rodo and Skywalker were somewhere behind me. We all kinda hike at different paces, so we got really spread out. I knew 3 different road crossings were coming up, so i was gonna have to be strategic about my timing running out onto the road. The first two roads were gravel roads with hardly any cross traffic, so that was easy. The third road was busy though and on the opposite side was a small trail parking area. So lots of opportunity to run into people lol. At this point, I assume half the gang is still ahead of me, paving the way, so i wasn't gonna pussy out and stop here. When the coast was clear, i darted across the road and tried to peel across the parking area and back into the woods. But what do i run into? A man doing a trail magic picnic right in the parking lot with lots of hikers gathered around. Stunned, i instantly look around for my naked friends, but they are not here! I'm the only revealing person here! FUCK. lol! Not knowing what to say, i just throw my arms up in the air and shout ""Happy Summer Solstice!"", to which the man replies ""Do you want some food...?"" LOL SO AWKWARD. But i did want free food, so i pulled my t-shirt out of my pack and sat down haha! We all became very well acquainted!
I asked if they had seen a group of naked dudes run through here yet and they said no. Turns out, the gang dipped off onto a side trail to go get high at a shelter, did NOT tell me, and left me to just go running through the woods half naked by myself!! TRAGIC. I was so pissed. Luckily, everyone at the picnic was a decent person and didn't take too much offense to the current state of affairs haha!
After the super awkward trail magic, i hiked on fully clothed with the gang still behind me somewhere. I came across a lake and decided to go swimming! Since i was alone and it is Summer Solstice, skinny dipping felt more than appropriate! lol After swimming, i hung out some more and had lunch. Eventually the gang caught up and had the same idea i did. They all jumped in the lake naked lol. I saw way too many pasty, white asses today. Enough for a lifetime. Haha!","stealth camping
",Shaker campsite,"Jun 21, Thu",14.10
V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595604,"I impressed myself today. 
The day started out super slow. We all didn't leave camp till about 9am. No one was really in a hurry because Caveman, Baby Face, Zoltan and Rodo only had to walk 3 miles to a road crossing where Caveman's parents were gonna pick them up and take them back to their house for the weekend. Caveman is from Massachusetts, so he's going to visit family for the weekend. Baby Face has college orientation to attend on Saturday. And Zoltan and Rodo just really wanted to rent a car and go do stuff in Boston. So really everyone but Skywalker and I is taking 3 zero days lol. Skywalker is hiking on a budget and has a tighter schedule then the rest of them, so we're hiking on for the weekend. 
The cool thing about Caveman's parents is that they wanted to bring some trail magic when coming to pick them up. And they went all out! They set out two large tables next to the road with neatly organized bags of chips, candy, soda, donuts, granola bars, everything! It was quite the spread. They kept saying take as much as you want! The only vegan snack were the sour patch kids, so i took a couple bags of those. Skywalker kept walking past the tables subtly taking small handfuls of stuff. He walked out of there with nearly a full 3 day resupply! lol Leach!
We hung out at the trail magic for awhile, and then eventually parted ways with the gang. They won't be back on trail until Monday. It feels weird saying bye, but they'll definitely catch up to us again. It just might take a week or longer. 
After walking another mile on trail, we hit a dirt road and saw this tiny, wooden shack right next to the road. It was about the size of a closet and was being used as a stand-alone hiker concession stand! It was stocked with granola bars, candy, a mini fridge with sodas and gatorade. It even had an outlet for you to charge your phone! The stuff wasn't free, but you paid for it by the honor system. Everything had a price tag on it, so you just selected what you wanted and put cash in the box. With the trail magic we just had, i didn't feel like i needed anything. But the concept was so cool i wanted to participate. So i bought a Mt Dew! lol
We hiked about another 2 miles on trail and hit trail magic AGAIN! I guy named Jim was sitting next to two coolers in the woods, one with sodas and the other snacks! So we hung out for a bit and chatted with him. He was super chatty, but really nice. Talked a lot about his time in the military, and helicopters, and skydiving, etc. lol
When we FINALLY started hiking again, I realized it was nearly 1pm and we'd only gone 5 miles lol! That's terrible. We still had another 14 miles to go. I honestly didn't think we'd make it, but we were just crushing the miles. It was awesome. Today was also the first day i've hiked without listening to ANY music and it wasn't so bad. Company helps though. 
Tomorrow the trail walks through Dalton, MA. It's 12 miles from where we're currently camped. Skywalker and I made last minute plans to stay in town tomorrow night. We're planning to get up early and get to town as quickly as possible, so that we have the rest of the day to chill. The biggest reason behind all of this is on the map it shows a motel right across the street from a place called ""Juice & Java""... this could potentially be my first trail smoothie. This is huge. We've been talking about smoothies for days out here, so i'm banking hard on this Juice and Java place. Also, it's a nice excuse to kinda take a break, shower, and maybe do laundry. I still haven't taken a single zero day (a day in which no trail miles are hiked) since coming out here, and i'm kinda proud of that lol.","Shaker campsite

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595605,"We started hiking at 6:30am today- Earliest start yet! And since the 12 miles ahead of us was pretty flat, we got to town by 11:30am! Skywalker kept screaming ""12 before 12, 12 before 12!!"". lol i was impressed with ourselves. 
Skywalker and I both got insulted on our appearance today lol. A lady told Sky that he ""looked really tired"" and a man told me that i ""looked like i'd just walked out of a beauty parlor"".... Ha. Ha. Asshole. We're officially hiker trash. 
After dropping our packs off at the room, we headed over to a sub shop down the street where we ran into Shortcuts! A hiker i hadn't seen since Pennsylvania! We all ate lunch together there. I got a foot long, TRIPLE veggie patty sub and it was AMAZING. Afterwards we walked over to Juice & Java (the place we'd been dreaming about) and i got a mango pineapple smoothie! FRIST trail smoothie!!
Took a shower, which was great. I almost forgot what it was like to bath with a washcloth. Like the dirt just came right off - crazy!! lol. The motel were staying at is called The Shamrock Inn and its sketchy AF. There's about 10 cats running around ""the lobby"" on some giant cat jungle gym. No one is at the front desk. Just a sign that says to knock on room 2 if you need help. All the mismatched furniture looks straight out of the 70s. There's literally a tan corridor recliner in the corner of our room lol. 
We pretty much spent the rest of the day eating a ton of food and being super lazy. We got tons of candy and snacks at the food mart across the street and got tofu tacos for dinner at this burrito shop. The whole day has honestly felt super weird to me. I kept feeling bad. And lazy!! Like the sun is still out, WE SHOULD BE HIKING! I literally couldn't enjoy the moment. We didn't even take a zero day. We hiked freaking 12 miles!! That's a fair day! Never again though. I hate this feeling. I don't know what i'm gonna be like after the trail. I'm gonna always feel like i have to be moving constantly! Its gonna be terrible, i can't think about it. lol","October Mountain shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595669,"We got started SO late today. It was impossible to get Sky moving. First he had to smoke a cigarette, then call his mom, then smoke a joint, then pack his shit. I wanted to kill him lol. 
While i waited i washed my cooking pot in the bathroom sink for the first time. It was SO gross lol. I also washed my socks in the sink and that was just the grossest water i've ever seen. Literally black. 
Then we went back to the juice/coffee shop place and had breakfast. We didn't get back to the trail until 11pm! On our way to the trail head we past through a small parking lot and ran into another hiker, Sunshine. I'd only met her briefly a couple days ago. The cool thing about seeing her though was that her mom was there visiting her and had a huge box full of goodies! Sunshine had already taken what she wanted from the box, so her mom let Skywalker and I take whatever we wanted! I got like 10 Clif bars, 5 packets of vegan Nutella, Ritz crackers, and trail mix. It was quite the snag. Happy trail magic to us! Every time i complained about our late start today, Skywalker made sure to remind me that if we had gotten started earlier we would have missed the MAGIC lol. That's one way to look at it. 
The trail passed through another town today, Cheshire, MA. We planned to do our resupply here because the trail went right by a Dollar General, which is way better than the gas stations in Dalton. I kept telling Sky that this resupply had to be quick, in and out. We still had so much hiking to do. But of course, the first place we pass going into Cheshire advertised ice cream and soda, so Sky had to stop and get ice cream and soda. lol
On our way to Dollar G, we ran into hikers T-Rex, Napper, and Doser. They said there was a storm coming, so they were staying in town at a hostel and gonna hike Mt. Greylock in the morning. Mt. Greylock is this giant ass mountain in MA. It's 3,500 ft, the highest point in the state. It's a 7 mile climb from top to bottom. It plateaus halfway up for about 2 miles, but still a bitch to climb. We told them we were going up, no matter the weather. After they walked away, Skywalker and I looked at each other and in unison shouted ""PUSSIES!"".
We didn't make it up the mountain either lol. We loitered outside of Dollar G for like an hour, ate a shit ton of junk food, filled our packs to the brim, and then started up the mountain at 6pm. Terrible! Haha. We went about 3 miles up and then just camped. We were trying to make it to a shelter/campsite, but we didn't wanna get there and be setting up camp in the pouring rain. The next water source is at the campsite though, and since Sky didn't fill up on water in town like an idiot, i'm having to ration my water with him. Leach. 
Whenever Sky and i camp together, we usually just throw both of our bear bags on the same rope line. Usually less work that way. But tonight both of our food bags our so heavy that we can't get them up in the tree lol! It's at least 40 lbs of food between the both of us. We got them like 7ft off the ground. Real pathetic looking lol. 
Tomorrow we gotta get our shit together though. We gotta go up and over and then some!","Dalton, MA motel

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595670,"The rain last night made today a super nice day to hike. I felt stupid for not making it to the shelter/campsite last night. It was literally only a 45 min walk away lol. Since Sky still didn't have any water, we had to stop at the shelter because it had the closest water. What was extra stupid though is that the walk to the shelter was 0.3 miles down the mountain, and then the water source (spring) was another 0.2 miles down the mountain. Sky kept joking ""looks like we're climbing Mt Greylock twice!"". Idiot. 
The top of Mt Greylock was not what we were expecting. It was huge, had this giant war memorial tower, a road, and a lodge with rooms and a restaurant. There were families everywhere just hanging out. We were so confused. But happy to see food!! 
We even had DOUBLE magic! The hostess at the restaurant pulled out this trail magic bag that some family left behind for hikers and we were the first ones to pilferage it! It was loaded with super healthy vegan snacks, even bags of instant organic black bean humus! SCORE. Since we had literally just resupplied yesterday, neither of us felt like we really needed any of this stuff. So we ending up trading out a lot of our food for the better food lol. 
The second trail magic was from this couple day hiking on the mountain looking for AT thru-hikers. They gave us chocolate chip cookies, brownies, and a soda! They were even carrying around a jar of vanilla frosting for you to lather up your cookies with lol. Skywalker ended up getting my cookie and brownie, so he was super stoked. We ended up having a great lunch on the mountain and didn't have to pay for any of it!
I realized today that even if we hadn't resupplied at all yesterday, we still could have gotten by. With the hiker food from Sunshine's mom yesterday and the trail magic bag today, we could have lived on that alone for a couple days. For the rest of the day, Skywalker and i kept chanting ""The trail provides! The trail provides!""
The hike down the mountain was honestly the hardest part. My knees always feel like they're gonna collapse in on themselves on these declines. I usually have to go really slow and Sky makes fun of me. Today he was talking a lot of shit and kept yelling ""Just run it out! Just run it out!"". And then mid sentence, he falls straight back and busts his ass on a rock lol. Karma's a bitch bro.  
We officially passed into Vermont today! I've finished about a quarter of the trail so far. Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine contain the next quarter. And shit is about to get real folks. Like really freaking HARD. Since Sky started in Georgia, he's 75% done. So today he kept saying that he was on his ""victory lap"". So cocky lol. I think New Hampshire is gonna be extremely humbling. 
A cool thing about Vermont though is that it has its own big hiking trail called the Long Trail. It's about 300 miles long, so about a 3 week trek. The AT and the LT overlap for the first 105 miles, so we're gonna start seeing a lot of LT thru-hikers real soon. A lot of AT hikers after finishing their thru-hike go back to Vermont and complete the LT since they've already done a third of it. So that's something to think about!","stealth camping

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595672,"We started hiking late today, AGAIN. I'm realizing that the more time we spend together, the more unproductive we get, and thus the more annoyed i get lol. Might need to start doing a little HYOH soon, which out here means ""Hike Your Own Hike!"". 
So another interesting thing about Vermont is that nudity is completely legal. So today Sky and I walked up on two nudist hiking the Long Trail. It was two guys in their 60s wearing nothing but backpacks! And they were just happy and as chatty as one could be. But they made sure to remind us that they weren't doing anything wrong lol. 
Met a Hiker Legend today - Pappy! Pappy is 87 years old, the oldest registered hiker on the AT. He was wearing long black tights, a slack-pack with just water and snacks, and a Korean War Veteran hat. He actually already completed the AT about 10 years ago, and then the PCT, and the CDT. So he's got his triple crown! But he's doing the AT AGAIN, just breaking it up in different sections over the course of the year. He's actually got a whole team that kind of sponsors him, giving him rides to and from the trail and moving his gear from one location to the next. Legen - wait for it - dary.
The latter part of the day contained this steep climb coming off of a road that led into Bennington, VT. We didn't need to go to Bennington, so we crossed the road and climbed back into the mountains. I wanted a head start though, so i left Sky at the bottom. I don't know what happened to me going up that mountain, but i was in the fucking zone. It was a long, steady climb and i was killing it. Sky and i were gonna camp at the top at a shelter, but once i reached the shelter i just didn't wanna stop. I felt like i was riding some kind of endorphin high and needed to keep hiking! So i powered out another 3 miles, and then realized that Sky was still behind me probably wondering where i went lol. So i stoped and filtered water while i waited for him. Eventually he showed up, and Foghorn and Twigs were with him! They were all talking about going up a little further to camp along ""Porcupine Ridge"". I told them to go ahead and that i might catch up, but i honestly didn't wanna catch up lol. I've been feeling really socially spent lately and the thought of camping by myself in the middle of the woods sounded bliss, so i did just that lol.","stealth camping
",stealth camping,"Jun 26, Tue",17.60
V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595673,"I crushed today! I hiked from 7am to 7:30pm. First day doing over 20 miles, and i even did it in the rain!
This morning i made sure to get moving pretty early because i had 19 miles planned. Since i let Skywalker and Foghorn get ahead yesterday, i spent the whole day hiking by myself and it was great! So great, that i reached camp by 3:30pm!
Foghorn told me yesterday (Tuesday) that a big thunderstorm was coming on Thursday, so he was gonna try and get up and over Stratton Mt before the storm blew in. At first i didn't know what he was talking about, but then today i pulled out the map and looked up the weather and was thinking DAMN - i have two options. 1) set up my tent at this campsite at the base of the mountain before it starts raining. And then climb the mountain in the morning in the middle of a thunderstorm, or 2) climb the mountain now in the rain, sleep in shelter on other side of mountain, and be able to reach Manchester, VT a day early to resupply. I'm really running low on food, so i chose the latter. 
It took me 3.5 hours to get up and over the mountain. 7 miles from base to base. When i first started at the base, it was only drizzling. But by the time i got to the top it was raining sideways with wind howling in my ears. Deciding to hike this mountain was super last minute. I had already done 19 miles for the day - typically my cut off point. My knees hurt. My ankles hurt. Everything was hurting. But it had to be done. 
The whole way up the mountain i kept telling myself that my legs were like an oiled machine. A machine that was just carrying my body up the mountain. And my mind was just along for the ride! I literally told myself that like a hundred time. That's the kind of mental zone i have to tap into in order to hike. Focused as fuck! lol. I didn't see a single hiker going up or down that mountain the whole time i was out there. Which either means i'm a badass or plain stupid lol. 
I reached the shelter around 7:30pm. Because of the weather, i half expected it to be full, but there was one spot left! This shelter is pretty big and it has bunks! This is also the FIRST shelter i have ever slept in. Up until today, i've slept in my tent every night, so lots of walls are being broken today! lol
I really tested my limits and i'm glad i did. Everyday i keep impressing myself with what i'm capable of doing. Never in a million years did i think i'd be hiking 26 miles in a day from dawn to dusk with mountains, rain, and finishing it by popping 800mg of ibuprofen and bunking next to strangers. I might not be able to move tomorrow, but today I feel like a god damn superhuman!","stealth camping

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595979,"Woke up to the sky falling this morning. It was a huge storm all night. One good thing about it though is that it drowned out the noise of all the people snoring. There were a lot of people in this shelter, like at least 20 of us. It dropped down into the low 50s last night, so i was thankful for the wooden walls compared to the thin nylon of my tent. 
I ate breakfast next to this guy named Handy. He looked like the doctor guy from the tv show House. He was a lot nicer though, but just as weird. He wore an orange puffy jacket with duct-tape patches on the back, a black beanie with a headlamp, and cheetah print pajama pants. I learned that he did his AT thru-hike last year and came back to do what he calls ""The Greatest Hits Tour"". He's just going around and re-hiking his favorite sections of the trail. He apparently lives on the trail now, like just staying out here for as long as he can! Crazy. 
Today i only had to hike 11 miles until i reached the road that led to Manchester Center, VT. It rained the whole 11 miles. The trail was a wet, slippery mess. I fell 3 times! Was just hydroplaning the whole way there. I was planning to catch up with Skywalker, who i assumed was ahead of me all day today and yesterday, but turns out he was like 10 miles behind! We're all out here in the same woods hiking the same trail, yet somehow shit gets turned around all the time. Once you're separated, you never know where anyone is. 
I was able to hitch a ride into town from this nice mom who just so happened to be picking her daughter up from the AT for the weekend. She dropped me off at a grocery store to resupply. I bought WAY too much food, including chips and guacamole that i ate on the spot. I looked legitimately homeless. I was loitering outside the grocery store HARD, just off to the side behind the potted plants section. I was soaking wet, my legs covered in mud, with food spread out all around me. Every now and then an old person would walk past me and just stare while pushing their grocery cart to their car. If i had set an empty cup out in front of me, i bet someone would have dropped money in it lol. 
There was a laundry mat right across the street, so that was convenient. I ran into Shorcuts there, and ended up sharing a washer with a hiker named Metric. With the storm and stuff it was so nice to get everything clean. Eventually, Skywalker just showed up out of no where. He made reservations at a hostel in town that a lot of other hikers were staying at. I had initially planned to stay there as well, but i dragged my feet on the planning and now there all booked up. They gave me a phone number though and told me to call this Lady named Jen who occasionally opens her home to hikers for a fee. I called her up and for $40 she took me in!
I spent most of the evening hanging out in town with Sky, Foghorn, and Twigs. Got a veggie burger, vegan ice cream - usual town routine. Word on the streets is that weed is gonna be legal in Vermont in 2 days, so everyone is losing their shit lol. The amount of weed i see hikers packing out of town sometimes is ridiculous. I don't know how these people get high everyday and still hike 15+ miles, but they do it, like literally all the time!
Eventually i made it over to Jen's house. There's one other AT hiker staying here tonight. Girl named Riddler who's also flip flopping. Jen is super nice and her place is great. She's got 4 spare rooms that she uses to hosts hikers and sometimes foreign exchange students. So i got my own room and bed. Got to take a great shower with soap and do important things like floss my teeth in a mirror! Towns man, they just suck you in! I could stay here forever.","Stratton Pond Shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595980,"So Jen told Riddler and I that she was gonna give us a ride to the trail head at 8am, but some how i didn't wake up until 7:55am. I guess that's what a real bed does to you after 6 weeks of sleeping in the woods lol. 
There were two big climbs today and fortunately i was up and over them before noon. Bromley Mt was pretty sweet. There was a ski lift on top of it from which you could get a 360 view for miles. That's super rare on the AT. When you spend the majority of the day hiking through a dense, green tunnel, it's easy to forget that you're surrounded by MOUNTAINS. 
Spent the latter half of the day hiking with Skywalker. He packed out this big jar of Sunbutter to eat on the trail, like peanut butter but made from sunflower seeds. I'd never had sunbutter before and have always been kind of weary of it. But everyone out here eats it. And since we're in the middle of the woods in liberal Vermont, i figured what the hell and i tried it. 
Never again lol. We ate it mid day and still had like 7 miles to hike! I felt like i was walking through quicksand the whole way. All i wanted to do was nap. And eat! I just kept snacking and yawning and snacking. I wasn't even hungry, but i couldn't be stopped! And all of Skywalker's stupid jokes now seemed completely hilarious. It all made no sense. We ended up sitting down on a log for a really long time. Some day hikers walked by with their dog and we just pet that dog for what felt like forever. Our destination was still 3 miles away, but we decided that the ground right in front of us looked just fine for camp. So we were done for the day lol. How do people eat sunbutter and still function productively, let alone hike? I have no idea. But now i know, sunbutter just isn't for me.","Jen's Hostel

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596347,"Today was pretty chill. Gotta super late start again, as per usual when camping with Sky. Ended up hiking most of the day by myself though. I'm so proud that i can hike all day now without listening to any music or podcasts. I just leave my phone off for days. HUGE breakthrough. 
It's getting really freaking hot. Like brutally hot. It's supposed to be like this ALL week. I've found myself playing water roulette a lot lately. I hate carrying water up these mountains because water weight 2 lbs per liter, which is heavy. So i've just been carrying enough water to get from one stream to the next. On hot days like this it's probably not smart. I'm dehydrated all the time lol. 
One terrible thing about hiking in the upper east coast during the summer is these mother fucking BLACK FLIES! Flies are annoying as is, but these flies are big and they BITE YOU!! Their bites literally leave welts all over your body and they don't give a shit about bug spray. They're ten times worse than misquotes. I've never dealt with anything like them.  
A mile before the campsite was a super nice river with swimming holes and a big suspension bridge. Lot of weekender people here though because we're really close to a road. Went swimming for like an hour! Feel so clean now lol. Camping with Sky and a guy named Too Lazy from Sydney, Australia. Too Lazy got some trail magic today and ended up packing out some avocados and he shared them with us! First trail avocado!
Really excited for tomorrow. Tomorrow night Skywalker and i and a bunch of other hikers are staying in Rutland, VT at a place called The Yellow Deli Hostel. Handy, a hiker i met a couple days ago, told me a lot about this place and convinced me that it's a must-stop on trail. I definitely don't need another night's stay in town, but i can't pass this up. 
The Yellow Deli is a restaurant and a hostel run by this ""religious group"" called the Twelve Tribes. Some people refer to it as a commune or religious community, but its basically a cult. They take hikers in, feed them, let them shower and do laundry - all donation based! But what they really try and do is keep you there! Handy was telling me all about his experience there last year. He went for a night and ended up spending a week there! There are literally AT hikers at this community that went to visit and have NEVER LEFT. They got GOT by the cult! lol. I think it's gonna be super interesting. And apparently they have some really good vegan food! I already feel hooked. Stay tuned to hear if i make it back to the trail!","stealth camping
",Claredon shelter,"Jun 30, Sat",17.10
V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596348,"Big day today! Started hiking at 6:45am because i knew it was gonna get hot AF and i had to get up and over Mt Killington, a big freaking mountain. It was a 6 miles hike from base to summit and it was a bitch. I killed it though! Was passing section hikers and Long Trail hikers the whole way up, which felt amazing lol.
I was really pumped to get to the summit because i heard there was a restaurant on top. A lot of these bigger mountains have stuff on top for all the skiers in the winter. Ended up being super disappointing though because it was like some upitty, over priced ski lodge cafe and bar. Their veggie burrito was $16! So ya, no thanks! All the people up there were so white and clean. They all took the gondola ride to the summit. We were apparently the only ones crazy enough to hike it in this 97 degree heat. 
I did happen to manifest some trail magic for myself today though! Early this morning, i was coming up on a road crossing, one of the only crossings for the day. I kept thinking there better be some magic up ahead, i need it today! So as i was walking across the road about to dip back into the woods, this truck goes blazing by and all of a sudden it pulls over to the curb when it sees me. This older, big white guy with thin framed glasses steps out and yells ""you want a soda!?"". He opened the bed of his truck and had a cooler full of off-brand sodas (my pick - Dr. Perky) over ice and then he went back into the cab and pulled out a case of peanut butter crackers. THE TRAIL PROVIDES! 
I met back up with Sky at the summit of Mt. Killington and we hiked the rest of the way to Route 4 and then hitched into Rutland, VT. While talking to the guy who picked us up (Dave), we discovered that the bride of a wedding Dave went to recently was Skywalker's geologist professor! lol Small world!
We're staying at the The Yellow Deli Hostel tonight run by the Twelve Tribes cult! Excuse me, ""intentional religious community"" lol. So stoked to be here. As the evening roles on, more hikers role in: Me, Skywalker, Riddler, Twigs, Foghorn, Tarzan, Handy, Steady, Too Lazy, and Chip n' Dale. I don't know what i was really expecting this place to be like, but it's absolutely amazing. The deli is a big, restaurant on main street. It has elaborate murals on the walls, everything is made of handcrafted wood, and fiddle music is playing in the background. I feel like i just took a step back in time and am in The Hobbit movie. Right when you walk in they give you a free glass of their famous peach Mate' ice tea. Skywalker and I feasted. I got a banana almond milk smoothie and the most delicious veggie burger i've ever had to my whole life. Seriously though. I think they put crack in the patty. Or maybe it was the tea. The whole place is so captivating and the people are so nice. I'm hooked. 
The hiker hostel is upstairs above the deli. There's a bunk room for the men and a separate one for the women, and a sign asking hikers to not co-habitat lol. This is the nicest place i've stayed on trail yet. Everything is so clean. They even put little goodie bags on all the beds with a towel and welcome card. We got a tour of the whole place. Free hiker breakfast is at 7:30am everyday. Instead of a ""hiker box"" like most businesses have (usually a random assortment of things hikers get rid of), they have a hiker closet! In which i found a bottle of Ibuprofen and Jock Itch foot spray, two things i desperately needed lol. 
Skywalker and i decided that tomorrow we're gonna zero here. ""Zeroing"" is a day in which no trail miles are hiked. I haven't taken one day off from hiking yet, so this will be my first zero! I think it's gonna feel really weird honestly. i'm scared i'm gonna get a little stir crazy, but it's for the best. My body needs it. Fortunately, since staying at the hostel is free, there's lists of chores on the walls in every room that tell you what needs to be done and how to do it. Helping prepare the ""hiker breakfast"" is one of the jobs, so i plan on doing that early in the morning. 
Ended up hanging out at the deli bar with Steady tonight. Steady is a NoBo whose been hiking the whole trail with his girlfriend, but she just had to get off trail for a work situation and it doesn't look like she'll be coming back. He was gonna ask her to marry him on top of Mt. Katahdin! So he's having a day.

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596349,"Got up early to help with the free hiker breakfast! One of the interesting things about this community is how they dress. All the men have facial hair, a small man-bun, and button down plaid shirts. All the women have long hair in a bun, long sleeve shirts, and long hippie pants. There's a sign in the women's bunk room asking visitors to please wear clothes from the communal wardrobe if volunteering in the deli. So i picked out a super sexy button down, collared shirt and some parachute type pants. 
Cooking the breakfast was fun. I had no idea what i was doing, but luckily Handy came down to help as well and he's a pro at this stuff so i just did whatever he said. We made eggs, biscuits with gravy, and cut watermelon. I kinda fucked the biscuits up. I forgot to mix all the liquid ingredients together before adding it to the dry ingredients... whatever, details. They were edible! Since i helped with breakfast, I got to sit at a ""special"" table with the other helpers and they gave us extra food, specifically a lot of extra fruit for me! Yay!
I chatted a lot with Handy, he's that hiker i met several days ago that looks like the doctor from the show House. He told me that right now he's hiking all along the AT and stopping at different hostels to find a potential place to work. He's literally been living on the trail for over a year now. I find that so fascinating. The fact that living on the trail and hiking around forever is an option for life just blows my mind! What a life!
I've never been so lazy in my life. I literally just sat around and ate way too much food all day. Skywalker and I went to the grocery store and got cereal stuffs! We mowed through an entire box of peanut butter chocolate Cheerios over vanilla cashew milk. And then we went and got another veggie burger downstairs. So fat it's painful. That's one thing i've noticed about town food - my stomach has shrunk and can't fit a whole meal. In the woods, we really don't eat ""meals"". Just a snack every 2-3 hours. So town meals make you feel like your gonna implode from the inside out lol. Food-baby game strong.
Our waitress at the deli was a younger girl. Super friendly. We started talking about the AT and she ended up disclosing that she was also an AT hiker once upon a time, head southbound, but then she came to the hostel and she decided to stay!! I was stunned. These were the hikers we had heard rumors about. The ones that never left. Literally quit their hike and joined the cult! Crazy!!
Besides stuffing our faces, we did the second most ""civilized"" American activity and went to the movies! lol Me, Skywalker, and Steady went and saw Jurassic World 2 at the theater across the street. It was super cheesy. And just made me feel more fat and lazy lol. 
Over the course of the day, i learned a lot about the whole ""intentional community"" thing. They all live and work together, but don't make a paycheck or any money. All the money that's made from their deli and farm is put into one communal pot. Everyone shares everything, so you never need to buy much. If you need something that the community itself can't make, you make a case for your expenditure and return all receipts to a bookkeeper. All the kids are homeschooled and you only marry within the community. All single women and single men stay in gender divided bunk rooms. And only married couples have their own room. So you're essentially never alone, like ever. They grow their own food, make their own clothes, furniture, instruments, etc. They have ""prayer & song"" twice a day. I didn't ask a whole lot about the religious side of things, but it's basically rooted in Christianity except the Bible is taken 100% literally among other extreme ideas. It was all incredibly fascinating, and i can kinda see how it would appeal to lost and lonely hikers who come wandering through here. 
But like all good things, you need to know when to walk away. So that's what we're doing tomorrow morning. Getting the hell out of here! lol Taking a day off has been great, but just doesn't feel right. Tomorrow it's back to the woods!","Yellow Deli Hostel

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596351,"I overslept this morning, so i didn't help make the hiker breakfast today, which made me feel like a freeloading piece of shit. There's a bus station right behind the hostel that has stops to the AT trailhead. Skywalker and I missed the 7:15 bus because we were asleep. We missed the 8:15 bus because we helped do dishes for awhile in the kitchen after breakfast. We missed the 9:15 bus because, well i don't remember, Sky was just dicking around all morning. So we caught the 10:15 bus and were on the trail again by 10:30. Terrible. lol
3 miles on trail and we hit another town, Killington, VT. We both had some quick business to do here. Sky had to buy new shoes at an outfitter because his toes were starting to poke out his current shoes. And i was picking up a care-package from my awesome Aunt Pat and Uncle Larry! 
Talk about the most bomb-ass vegan care-package ever made!! It was full of my favorite vegan cookies, super fancy vegan bars, and my aunts famous peanut butter fudge that she makes vegan just for me! I was stoked. I never would have splurged and bought any of this stuff for myself, so it was a real treat. Skywalker and I opened the fudge and ate it all right in the post office parking lot. Great lunch! 
Quimby Mt. was a bitch. Especially with the super heavy pack. It's still so freaking hot. This heat wave is supposed to last several more days. Literally boiling alive out here. 
With the late start this morning, and the stop through Killington, VT, we didn't make it very far. Only about 10 miles. I was willing to push on, but Sky got really high and became utterly useless. So we called it a day lol. He has to average at least 15 miles a day in order to finish the trail before he goes back to college mid August. He took a semester off to do this. So since today was a short day, he wants to try and make up for it tomorrow and do 22 miles. I'm kinda annoyed, but i know i can do it. Just gotta get an early start.","Yellow Deli Hostel

It's Forth of July today, which also means it's my ""Vegaversary""! 11 years of no meat!! I'm celebrating by eating a ton of vegan cookies from my Aunt Pat. I also hit mile 700 today! So much to be excited about. 
Walked 0.2 miles down a road to a farm market and had a real lunch! Juice, salad, and an apple. Met two other hikers, Crafty and Hulk Hogan. The heat is destroying all of us today, so the food was a nice break. 
The high today was 95. And the entire day was chalk full of PUDs. The elevation chart looked like someone with a goddamn heart murmur. It was brutal. About 14 miles in, my right Achilles' tendon really started acting up. Like it hurt bad. I popped 800 mg of Ibuprofen and hiked with a limp for the last 8 miles. 
Came across a cooler full of sodas next to a river! Thank you! I needed the sugar rush. Another nice surprise was the endless bushes of wild raspberries on top of a mountain. I picked berries for nearly half an hour lol. 
Finally made it the full 22 miles to the shelter/campsite. Crafty, a white bearded retired guy, is the only other person here. No sign of Skywalker. I thought he'd wander in not too long after me, but looks like he didn't make it. I'm kinda pissed because he was the one making a big deal about making up the mileage and sticking to his average, but he couldn't even do it! So i killed myself today for nothing basically lol.

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597679,"Wow. A whole 2 weeks has passed and I’ve been through a lot of shit. Sorry, this is gonna be a long post. Where to begin...
Well for starters, I broke my phone just 2 days after my last post. I was trying to have a phone conversation with a friend while hiking in a thunderstorm. I know, so stupid. It was a really weak mental moment, okay. 
I’ve mentioned before how I started this journey seeking a challenge. I never did this because I thought it would be some kind of vacation or “break”. I wanted to test my limits and find out what I’m really capable of accomplishing. These past 2 weeks have pushed that test to the extreme. It’s hard for me to believe I’ve made it this far (900 miles). And it’s even harder for me to believe that I’m not stopping. 
New Hampshire was intense. I expected it to kick my ass and it really did. NH is home to the “The Whites”, an infamous mountain range that has the reputation for being the most physically challenging part of the trail - oh, and was it ever. 
“The Whites” begins with Mt Moosilauke, a five and a half mile climb with a 4,802 ft peak. I’ll never forget that day. I was hanging out at the foot of the mountain at Jeffers Brook Shelter/Campsite. It was a Sunday afternoon (around 1:00) and I was trying to decide if I was gonna hike the mountain today or the next morning. I had already hiked 13 miles that day, so I knew going up and over the mountain was gonna be a feat. While I was eating my lunch and contemplating these big life decisions, a SoBo wandered up and introduced himself as Cheesy. “SoBos” are south-bounders that are thru-hiking the AT from Maine to Georgia, so doing the trail “backwards”. They’re a rare breed. I had already crossed paths with about a dozen a few days before, but Cheesy was the first one I’d actually had a conversation with. It’s hard to put our encounter into words, but we had a very weird, real moment. He had just come down Mt Moosilauke, which for him was the LAST mountain of “The Whites”. I was about to finally begin my journey into “The Whites”. We were both beginning two entirely different chapters of the AT and we both knew what the other person was about to experience. Talking to Cheesy was like talking to some rare, mythical unicorn that had all the answers to the future. I sat there in that shelter for nearly 2 hours with him. I eventually decided that waiting until the following day to summit the mountain just wasn’t an option. I thought if I didn’t do it right then and there, it wasn’t gonna happen.
It’s so crazy to describe, but in that moment I literally felt like my stomach was gonna bottom out. I was about to attempt the most physically challenging thing I’d ever sought out to do. And it wasn’t just gonna be one mountain, but an entire mountain range. I was terrified. What if I couldn’t make it? What if I got halfway up the mountain and decided it was impossible, then what? These were my thoughts the whole way up. But by the almighty grace of the heavens, I summited that god damn mountain. And then some. 
Besides being super hard, “The Whites” are known for being exceptionally beautiful. It’s the only part of the trail where the mountain peaks are above tree line - and not just for a hot second on the tip of the mountain, but for like miles and miles. When I got to the summit of Mt Moosilauke, there was a day-hiker up there. Since I didn’t have a phone anymore (and thus no camera), I got him to take my picture and send it to my dad. I used this method many more times to document my journey through the mountains. The day-hiker was from NH and while we were up there he pointed off into the distance and started naming all the mountains that the AT crossed. It was insane to stand up there and see where I was gonna be the next day, and then the next, and then the next! That’s when it really started to sink in. I am hiking legit mountains. 
Everyday after that, I’ve had to wake up with my “game face” on. No more “easy” days or “sleeping in” days. I had to wake up every morning ready to conquer. I hiked Kinsman Mt, then Mt Lafayette (my 800 mile marker), Mt Garfield and Twin Mt, then all of “The Presidential’s” in ONE day (which included Mt Washington - the 2nd deadliest mountain in the world), and then 21 miles over the Wildcat Peaks (p.s. the cat bites back!). Took me 8 days to get through it all. Never did I think I’d have to face the toughest part of the trail with no phone, camera, music, blogging, or friends. But shit happens I guess. 
I still haven’t reconnected with my buddy Skywalker. I’ve been hiking and camping mostly alone for the past two weeks. It honestly kinda feels like I’m starting from the beginning again. Having the company of familiar faces definitely made the trail more manageable. And thus losing that has started to weigh on me mentally. One of my biggest mistakes was thinking that the trail would get easier once I crossed over the border into Maine. Wow, what a pipe dream. Maine is extremely fucking hard too. Go figure. Next time you have a free moment, go YouTube some videos of people going through the “Mahoosuc Notch” or climbing up the “Mahoosuc Arm”. I did that shit yesterday. There’s no more “hiking” in Maine. It’s become strictly rock climbing. Like it should be illegal to call this shit a “trail”. 
I’m obviously a little jaded at the moment. Positivity and strength to keep going has been scant. Don’t worry, I’m not quitting. But I’m gonna continue to complain about how hard this shit is and update everyone on every fall and stumble and mental wall I encounter. I got 250ish miles until Mt Katadhin - my halfway point. Send all the good vibes! I needs them.","

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598148,"Today was better. I really tried to start with a better attitude. Having my phone back helps a lot though. Not only was I able to listen to music all day, but I got to make some long overdue phone calls last night and get a much needed pep talk from my anchors back home.   
Last night I stayed at a hostel in town called The Pine Ellis Lodging & Hostel. In the guide book, it sounds super legit - full kitchen, free laundry, fresh linens, and shuttle service to/from trail, etc. In reality though, it was just an old house occupied by two old ladies who just let you have the run of the place lol. There were little post-it notes all over the kitchen and bathroom that told you the rules, what you were allowed to touch and what wasn’t for you. A note on the door to the living room said “Please take a shower and do laundry before entering.” Point taken Lol. They gave hikers a ride to the trailhead every hour. I chose the 9am slot because sleeping in on a real bed sounded heavenly, and it was. Most people left at 7 or 8 though. 
Ten miles into my hike, I crossed a second road on trail that also led back to the same town, Andover, ME. Torino and Spider were sitting by the road waiting for a ride back into town. They had stayed at Pine Ellis last night as well, and were now dipping back into town to stay at a different hostel. The whole idea was very tempting, but I resisted and decided to keep hiking. 
Torino I knew from Pennsylvania and Spider is a girl I’d just met about a week ago at a hostel in Gorham, NH called “The Hiker Barn”. And it was exactly what it sounds like - a barn full of bunks for hikers lol. I took a zero day there after finishing “The Whites”. I needed it both mentally and physically. Spider, Torino, and a whole bunch of other hikers waded in and out. A lot of SoBos mainly, so all new faces. I mention all of this because Spider, and almost every other NoBo in there, was having a real tough time. There was a psychological funk in the air and I was feeling it too. New Hampshire fucked us up and we were all jaded by it. Spider started in Georgia, only has one state left and less than 300 miles, and she talked about wanting to quit! Like legit, she might go home. I can’t understand how quitting can be an option when you’re that close to the finish line, but she did look absolutely miserable. Therefore, I wasn’t surprised to see her on that road today headed back for another night in town. I just really hope she makes it out. 
After parting ways, I headed back into the woods and did a 3,600ft climb up Old Blue Mt. One of the most discouraging things about NH and ME that I’ve had to come to terms with is high speeds and high mileage no longer matter. Before NH, I was doing around 17 miles a day at 2.3 mph easily, no matter the inclines. Now though, there’s days where 10-14 miles absolutely kills me. And some parts of trail become so technical I only move a mile per hour. When you’re used to looking at your speed and mileage as a way to track your success and progress, it’s hard to do a 10 mile day and still feel proud of yourself. I’ve been having those days a lot lately, which was a big contributor to my shitty attitude. Today though, I decided that it’s not a race. I’m not competing with anybody. I’m not trying to keep up with anybody. I’m just hiking. And everyday I’m just taking another step forward toward my goal. Whether that be 7 miles or 17 miles, doesn’t matter. Progress is progress.","Andover, ME

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598149,"Today was a pretty sweet day. The terrain was comparatively “easy” considering what most of Maine entails. And the weather was perfect. I tried to enjoy it because apparently it’s supposed to rain for like the next 5 days. So I’ll be living in eternal wetness soon. 
Today was also MAGICAL. Got some nature magic on top of a mountain peak - wild blueberries galore! And had TWO run-ins with trail magic! Which was super surprising because it’d been weeks since I saw any. No one was climbing Mt Washington to hand out free sodas unfortunately lol. But today, I came across a cooler in the woods full of Ginger Ale, candy, and mandarin orange fruit cups! Whata snag. 
And then, a couple miles further, the AT intersected with a highway and there were little signs posted up telling hikers to walk down the road to this scenic overlook. Low and behold, I walk up to a big van with a tailgate tent up and a table full of free food. God bless. The people were so great. It was a couple who hiked half the AT last summer. Their trail names were Green and Tea lol. They were cooking hotdogs and burgers, but when I told them I was vegan they pulled out a whole bag of produce for me! Apples, bananas, oranges, yay! They also had a “hiker box” that was full of miscellaneous hiker stuff. I know I’ve mentioned a lot how the “trail provides”, but I swear to god there is some crazy force of nature out here that takes care of hikers. The two specialty items I needed to buy on my next resupply were fuel for my stove and some drink flavor packets (because I’ve really been craving juice on trail). And what do I find in these people’s magic box? A full canister of fuel and Crush soda drink packets. That’s some crazy shit... I see it happen out here to hikers all the time. Walk up to a water source that’s completely dried out? Someone left a case of water bottles. Sprang your ankle on top of a mountain? There’s a gondola in operation that can take you down. Childhood dream to visit Hershey park in PA? A day hiker offers you a ride there and back! The list goes on. Blows my mind. 
One great thing about hiking in Maine is the many swimming opportunities to be had on trail. The AT crosses by lots of lakes and ponds and the water is always super clear. Besides being a bitch to hike, Maine is really pretty. Maine is a state I’ve always wanted to visit. I always assumed I’d be flying here though, not walking lol. I only have around 200ish miles in Maine left, so I’m trying to learn to slow down and enjoy it more. I think there’s more to be had on this trail than hiking, and so far I’ve really just been doing a lot of hiking. I’m in a fortunate position to not have to have a deadline or cut-off date. Most NoBos out here have to finish by early August to get back to work or school. But as for me, I have no where to be, but the trail. So why rush any of it really?","Stealth camping

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598150,"This morning’s hike was a nice reprieve from the usual. It was a swift 5 miles to a road - I was moving at nearly 3 mph! Glad to know I haven’t completely lost my stride. I did fall into a mud sink hole though nearly knee deep on both legs. When I pulled myself out, there was just mounds of mud caked onto my boots. That definitely slowed me down. 
The road lead into Rangeley, ME, which was about 9 miles away. I didn’t need to go into town, so I didn’t bother hitching. But just 0.3 down the road is the Hiker Hut Hostel, which I read sells snacks! So I did the walk. And glad I did! I got some Sour Patch Kids, a free banana, and a picture of me with a chipmunk eating right out of my hand! I hung out there way longer than I should have. I was mainly stalling the inevitable climb I’d have to make up Saddleback Mt. 
Saddleback Mt is a 4,120ft climb with 3 miles of exposed ridge line over the peaks (which I was highly unaware of). On my way up, I passed by this older, SoBo guy having a snack break alongside the trail. As I passed him, he wittingly asks, “You know it’s gonna storm, right?”... Bro, if I stopped hiking every time the weather said it was gonna rain I wouldn’t get anywhere! Also we’re thru-hikers! Rain, shine, cold, hot - it’s what we do! I didn’t actually say any of this, but it’s what I wanted to say. 
And yes, halfway up the mountain it started pouring down rain. It wasn’t until I got to the top and read a sign (“No Camping for the Next 3 Miles”) that I realized I was gonna be hiking in a storm with no tree cover for 3 damn long miles. And let me tell you, that was some scary shit. It was so freaking windy, like blowing me straight sideways. I had to lean into it while I hiked in order to stay standing. And the rain, the cold cold rain. It was so hard to see where you were going. Since there’s no trees, there’s no white blazes to mark the trail. So instead you follow these little rock pyramid things. But when you’re in the middle of a cloud during a storm on top of a mountain, you can’t see shit! Eventually, I ran into a SoBo hiker. But like literally, we almost collided straight into each other. His exact words were “Holy shit! Thank god someone else is up here! I was starting to think, if I died no one would find me!” Lol! I was surprised to see him too. And also glad I wasn’t the only one stupid enough to be up there. The sketchiest part about hiking mountains though is the hiking down part. It’s just a bunch of huge, jagged rocks on a steep, steep wall. And then add rain to that and you’re just fucked. I was moving at 1 mph. Sliding on my but as much as possible. 
Eventually I make it to the shelter/campsite. The shelter was not surprisingly very full. I sat on the outer edge barely under the roof. I wanted to wait for the rain to let up a bit before setting up my tent. I tried to cook my dinner while I waited, but my fingers were so cold and numb I couldn’t use the freaking lighter to light my stove! Luckily someone helped me. I’ve been cold a lot on trail. And wet a lot on trail. But cold AND wet, that shit will break you. I set up my tent in the rain and then got inside it with my soaking wet clothes on, so now everything is wet and muddy. I ringed out all the water in my shorts and socks, and then put dry clothes on. But since my body is still wet, my sleeping clothes are now wet too. My rain jacket is laying in a lonely puddle in the corner of my tent. My hair is dripping all over my sleeping bag. I’ve never felt so uncomfortable in my life. And guess what? I get to do it all again tomorrow.","Little Swift River Pond campsite

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598151,"Was moving really slow this morning. When you wake up to everything wet and damp it’s hard to be motivated to do anything. 
Had to ford my first Maine river today! When I was coming up to it, a SoBo was right in the middle of it hobbling over the rocks. He shouted “Don’t watch! You’re about to get a front row seat of me eating shit!” Lol. He made it across successfully though and completely dry. Then he looked at me and said “Now I get to stand here and watch you try to cross!” Oh god. The pressure. I looked like a handicapped giraffe, all hunched over on my trekking poles trying to find some balance on the slick rocks. I did it though! Even with the audience. Apparently, that’ll be my first of many river crossings. For some reason Maine doesn’t do footbridges like all the other states do, so you gotta get across on foot no matter how soaked you get in the process. There’s a couple rivers where if it’s rained a lot recently it’s supposedly pretty dangerous to cross. The guidebook recommends the “buddy system” for those crossings, so hopefully I get a buddy!
I stopped at a shelter for lunch, so that I could try and be dry while I ate. Everyone seemed to have the same idea because there was about 6 other hikers here eating. I didn’t notice it until I stopped moving, but I have this terribly painful chaffing rash between my thighs. I sat my pack down and started hobbling around the shelter. There was an older couple there in their 60s doing some southbound, section hiking. The woman was really tiny, but wore this giant rain poncho and a purple visor that stuck out nearly a foot from her forehead. The man was tall and had these thin framed, purple glasses that curved up into a point on the ends. Like the ones I imagine librarians wore in the 50s. He honestly looked and talked like a cartoon character. He asked me why I was walking funny, so I flashed him some rashy red inner thigh and said “It’s my pants, they’re soaking wet!” He looked at me with the most serious face and said “If I had a nickel for every time a woman said that to me, well, I’d have one nickel”. Lol! I just about died. He was legitimately crazy. 
The rain slowed down as the day went on and eventually stopped. The descent down to the campsite I was headed to was long and sketchy. I was thankful I didn’t have to do it in the rain because it would have been bad. I passed another older couple on the way down, only to see them hobble into the campsite an hour later with the woman holding her bloody knee. It really was a sketchy climb down. 
Glad I got to camp by 5pm because I was able to hang up my tent and clothes and give everything a chance to dry before it rains again later tonight. Apparently tomorrow is supposed to be kinda nice, but Wednesday and Thursday are thunderstorms again. At least that’s the word on the trail. I can’t check the weather or do much of anything on my phone anymore while in the woods. AT&T doesn’t exist in Maine, so cell reception these days is rare. Every time I tell someone on trail that I have AT&T they just look at me and laugh. Jokes on me I guess.
Tomorrow I pass a road that leads into Stratton, ME. I definitely need to do a small, quick resupply, but it’s tempting to wanna stay overnight. Maybe even two nights! I don’t know though. I feel like I used to be able to handle bad weather on the trail so well, but lately I’ve become such a pussy. Doing a bunch of hostel hopping. Washing my clothes once a week. What happened to me!

I hitched into town and got dropped at a gas station to do some resupplying. That gas station got me good. I walked in there around noon and didn’t leave until 5pm! They had food, a bathroom, outlets, and WiFi! What more could you ask for! I made some phone calls and downloaded some new music. It was SO tempting to stay in Stratton, but considering the sunny day I decided to save the money and keep pushing.
On my hitch back to the trail, this mom picked me up on her way home from work. She was very nice, but she asked this super stereotypical question that I get all the time from strangers out here and at this point it’s hard not to give a sassy response. The question is “So like what are you doing out here? Are you trying to find yourself or something?” Like god damn, why does everyone assume we’re just a bunch of young, lost souls out here. I just hate the assumption that if you’re young and not in school or working a 9-5 job then obviously you’re “lost” and don’t know what the fuck you’re doing. Fuck that! I didn’t come out here to “find” myself! I came out here to BUILD myself!! I did the schooling and I did the jobs. But I feel like there’s so many alternative routes to life that don’t involve sitting behind some kind of desk. I’m not saying I’ll never have another job again and pay my dues to The Man, but I’m definitely gonna make it a priority to try and do whatever the hell I want on any given day. I’m sorry, I’m done. Just don’t be the next person to ask me that. Lol 
At the gas station, I ran into two other hikers that I had only met briefly before in Gorham, NH - Mr. Potato and Kidska. They hitched out of Stratton around the same time I did, so we crossed paths going up Bigelow Mt. And so glad, we did. It was a five mile hike to the next shelter and 2.5 of those miles were essentially vertical. Following them up that mountain was the only thing keeping me moving. I barely know them, but since I’ve been hiking alone for a couple weeks now, just their company was super motivating.  
Even though it was just a 13 mile day, I’m hella impressed with myself. I dipped into town for 5 hrs, hiked 2 mountains, and still got to camp before dark. That’s a full day. It’s just the three of us tonight at this shelter and since it’s supposed to rain again, I decided to actually sleep inside the shelter instead of my tent. Big step for me.

It just acted like it was going too, so super windy and chilly. This is why as a hiker you never adjust your plans to the weather because the weather never does what it says it’s going too. Like hardly ever. 
I followed Kidska and Mr. Potato for most of the day. To say we were hiking “together” is a bit of a stretch. I mainly just eased dropped on their conversations as we went up and down the Bigelow Mt peaks. I’m not even sure if they wanted me there, but their presence was comforting nonetheless. Lol 
Ran into some more wild blueberries today on the peaks! They were literally everywhere this time. Definitely slowed me down a bit. Lol There was also some trail magic! Someone left a cooler in the woods full of apples! Apple magic! Best kind of magic. I took two. 
Camping by myself tonight in this super killer spot on the beach of a lake! Weather is too cold and misty to go swimming, but still beautiful. It looks like it’s definitely gonna storm tonight. In hindsight, I probably should have chosen a spot with more tree cover, but whatever. Everything gets wet eventually!
Just took a moment to etch out some plans for the next week and hot damn, I think I’ll be summiting Mt Katadhin (the northern terminus) in like 11 days! That’s less than two weeks! I didn’t realize it was coming that quickly. It feels weird to almost be at my halfway point. I can’t imagine being a NoBo right now. Mt Katadhin is their finish line and then it’s done.

The trail is still a really rooty, rocky, muddy obstacle course though, just minus the big inclines and scrambles. I can also officially say that I have hiked 1,000 miles through 10 U.S. states! Crazy cool. 
I’ve mentioned before all the great, beautiful swimming opportunities Maine has to offer, but there’s a reason why I haven’t swam in any lake or pond yet. And that’s because of the soul-sucking, blood thirsty LEACHES! I saw this huge, sandy pond this afternoon with really clear water. So clear that you could see leaches swimming all over the bottom waiting for some sorry hiker to jump in naked. Leaches absolutely terrify me. I can’t look at a leach and not think of that scene from the movie Stand By Me. Terrifying! Honestly, between the ticks, mosquitoes, and leaches, there are just WAY too many things out here waiting to suck your blood. 
Set up my tent this evening in a nice secluded spot next to a different pretty pond only to read the shelter log book 20 mins later and learn that a guy named Clockwork (who I’ve met a couple times) set up his tent in the exact same spot as me the night before and masterbated right outside his tent’s vestibule...

This shelter is kind of a “hot spot” because if you don’t stay here, well there’s not really anywhere else for you to go. It’s only a 4 mile hike between the shelter and the road that leads to Caratunk, ME. But in between the shelter and town is the Kennebec River. The Kennebec River isn’t like any of the other rivers the AT crosses. It’s a BIG freaking river. So big that the guidebook tells you NOT to attempt to ford it. The river is damned upstream and it’s currents are very unpredictable. So the ATC has put in place a “ferry service” to transport hikers across the river. And by “ferry” I mean a guy in a little canoe that paddles hikers across in twos. The ferry only runs from 9am-2pm though, which is why everyone was stuck at that shelter last night. So the whole lot of us showed up at 9am and after signing release forms and strapping on life jackets, we slowly but surely got paddled to the other side. 
Once my feet hit the northern shore of the river bank, I was running to town, which thankfully was only like half a mile. There’s a super popular, hiker B&B right off trail in Caratunk that I had planned to stay at, but they were full by the time I got there. Since I don’t get cell reception out here anymore, it’s nearly impossible to make reservations ahead of time. So instead I’m staying up the road at a place called Sterling Inn. It’s not a hostel, but not a hotel. Kinda just a nice, clean motel that has one room set aside with bunks for hikers. For the cheap price of $30, I got a clean bed, shower, laundry, breakfast tomorrow morning, and return shuttle to the trailhead. What a deal. 
The owner is super chatty, but really cool. He let me hang all my wet gear over his white porch to dry out in the sun. I got to wash my sleeping bag, which I think is only the 2nd or 3rd time on trail yet. It smelled like mildew. Lol And he gave me a ride to the post office to pick up an awesome care package from my fabulous Aunt Pat! It was full of vegan treats and her famous vegan peanut butter fudge, which made me super popular amongst the other hikers back at the motel. 
The town stops are always the same, but never get old. You clean up, dry out, and refuel. And by “refuel” I mean gorge yourself on junk food until you’re so painfully full that it physically hurts to move. A literal beached whale. That’s what I feel like right now. I ate an entire family sized bag of salt and vinegar chips until my tongue went raw. Lol
I also got to catch up on my blog and reconnect with the world virtually. The encouragement and support I’m getting from friends and family (even strangers right now!) is overwhelming and literally means the world. Thank you x100! It’s the only thing that keeps me going most days. It gets really hard out here sometimes, so to know that people back home believe in me and are keeping tabs on my journey REALLY HELPS. LIKE A LOT. Y’all have no idea, so thank you so much.","Pierce Pond shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598818,"Wow, was it hard to get moving today. Breakfast was served from 7-9am. So the whole lot of us hung out in the dinning area for the full 2hrs, eating muffin after muffin until they stopped bringing out more muffins. Lol After that, all I wanted to do was go back to the bunk and lie down. So I did. Fat, lazy hiker. 
Around 10am, all the hikers got shuttled back to the trail head (me, Kidska, Mr. Potato, Stinger, Flower, & Sparky). It’s weird getting dropped on the trail as a group. I know my hiking stride, so I let everyone rush ahead of me. I hate when I know someone is trailing close behind me. Makes me feel like I’m being chased uphill the whole time. Lol
About 6 miles in, I hit a shelter and stopped for a snack break. Everyone else was there too. The hiker diet is already pretty bad, but lately I feel like I’ve really been giving into it. I packed out way too much food this time and it’s essentially all garbage. Sour Patch Kids, Biscoff cookies, and these “accidentally vegan” Krispy Kream boxed apple pies. What have I become? Lol 
Considering the slow morning and everything, I was in no rush to get to camp. I took my time, took a lot of breaks. Straight chilling. But DAMN, that ended up being a terrible mistake. Around 5:00 I started to hear thunder rumbling in the distance. And then I remembered someone saying that we were supposed to get some late afternoon showers. I knew I was about 3 miles from the next shelter, so I started booking it! I’ve never hiked so fast in my life entire life. I kept thinking, I’ll be damned if me and everything I own gets soaked again on the day I walk out of town. I kept hearing the thunder get closer and closer. At this point, I was literally running my ass up the trail. And it really was all uphill, of course. But even with all the effort, I didn’t fucking make it. The sky opened up and straight dropped on my head when I was less than 10 mins away from the shelter! It was pouring. And the lightning omg! It was SO freaking loud. Striking no more than 50 ft away from me. I let out an audible shriek every time it touched ground. It was the loudest storm I’ve ever heard and I was running right in the middle of it. 
I finally make it to the shelter around 5:45, completely drenched. As I roll in, all the people in the shelter applaud. Lol It was the same cluster of hikers that stayed at the motel last night. They had gotten there an hour earlier, so they were all very dry. I was the only wet idiot this time. 
After taking a second to process what felt like a near death experience, I changed into dry clothes and grabbed a spot in the shelter. No way I’m setting my tent up in this shit. Not today. Eventually the rain slowed down and even stopped for a bit. The next shelter is only 4 miles away, so a lot of people pushed on after dinner. However, it’s on the other side of a mountain, 2 miles up then 2 miles down. So I definitely stayed. It was never in my plan to do a 20+ day. Super glad I didn’t go because an hour after they left the storm came back harder than ever. And it lasted all through the night.
Stinger and I are the only ones that stayed. This will now be my 3rd time sleeping inside a shelter, and not my tent. I’m learning that these things are pretty nice on really rainy days. I could see myself using them a lot more probably when I flip south and am not surrounded by so many people. I’m just always worried about mosquitoes attacking my face in my sleep. Lol","Caratunk, ME

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598819,"Killed it today! Did 22 miles from 9am to 6:30pm, and that’s with an hour lunch break. When the 4,500ft mountains go away, I’m learning that I’m actually kinda fast. Lol Really I was just motivated to get to town. I realized that I could either nero into town tomorrow afternoon, or push hard today and then have a full zero for tomorrow. So I chose the latter. 
I feel like I could have finished hiking even earlier, but the trail was an absolute mess. Whenever you’re hiking uphill after a lot of rain, the rain water just drains down the trail right between your feet. Most of the trail was in ankle deep, muddy water. So you can only slosh through that so quickly. There were also 4 different rivers to ford today. The worst of them was the Piscataquis River. It’s usually a knee deep river, but with the rain it became thigh deep. Luckily trail maintenance people installed a big rope between two trees going over the river. So as long as you held on for dear life, you could make it across mostly dry. 
When I came out to the road, a nice old couple gave me a hitch into town. They actually did a complete u-turn to pick me up and take me the opposite direction from where they were headed. They were convinced that they “saved me” from the crazy locals of Maine. Lol They lectured me on the risks of hitching for the full 10 mins. What do they expect me to do though? Walk??.. Ha! 
I got dropped at a gas station with a deli where I got a an all veggie, hold-the-cheesy, pizza for dinner. While I was waiting for my food, a flood of hikers rolled in. All familiar faces - Kidska, Potato, Stinger, Flower, Sparky, Hot Tang, Aladdin, and Coolio. We’re all staying at Shaw’s hostel tonight, so it’s a party!","Bald Mountain Brook shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598821,"Today is my last town stop/resupply before I hit the “100 Mile Wilderness”, so I’m zeroing at Shaw’s hostel for the day. The 100 MW is a well-known chunk of trail because it’s the longest section of the AT (100 miles) where you don’t pass any roads or towns. So you comparatively have to carry a lot of food (6-10 days) versus the usual (3-5 days). It’s also a really shitty place to get injured because you’d have to get brought out by a search and rescue team and it’d take them awhile to get to you. I plan to do it in 6 days, so I’ll be carrying about 12 pounds of food. 
On August 6th, the day after the 100 MW, is when I’ll be summiting Mt Katadhin. It’s literally an all day thing, so it gets its own day. On the 7th, I’ll be figuring out transportation from Baxter State Park to Bangor, ME. And then on the 8th, I fly back to Harpers Ferry, WV. It’s gonna be a full week! So today I’m doing a lot of eating and napping. My dinner consisted of breaded mushrooms, fried onion rings, and french fries. I did actually try and order a salad first, but they told me they were out of lettuce? So I figured what the hell. One glorious, fried gas station dinner. Lol
PSA to family. I have zero cell reception in Maine, so sorry if you can’t get ahold of me! I’ll post more updates here when I get to the airport. Talk to y’all on the other side!","Monson, ME

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599778,"This morning I left Shaw’s hostel, my last hostel stay in Maine! Glad I zeroed there. Shaw’s is a hostel staple. Some would say it’s the most popular hostel on trail. The guy running it, Poet, was super great. He owns two houses on the same street. One house for the hostel and the house next door for his family. He thru-hiked the AT in 2008 and got the name “Poet” because he was always writing hi-cues in the trail registers/logs. When I told him my name was “V”, he instantly guessed that it was a reference to “V for Vendetta”. He used to be an English teacher and said he made his students read that book every year. He asked me if I carried a mask for my summit picture... A mask?! I gawked in shock and disappointment. How did I never think of that?!? That would have been an amazing Katadhin photo! 
Traditionally, a lot of people take crazy photos on top of Mt Katadhin, wearing costumes, suit and tie, etc. I never gave mine much thought, but the “anonymous mask” would have been perfect. If only I had thought of it sooner. Poet could tell i was pretty bummed, so he says, “Whenever you get out of the 100 Mile Wilderness, stop by the Abol Camp Store and see if there’s a package for V. No promises! But you might get your mask.” ...What a cool fucking dude! I’m not gonna get my hopes up, but just the gesture alone is SO nice. 
Poet shuttled a whole group of us to the trail head around 8:30. After 50 ft on trail, you run into this very welcoming sign that states, “Caution: There are no places to obtain supplies or get help until Abol Bridge 100 miles north. Do not attempt this section unless you have a minimum of 10 days supplies and are fully equipped. This is the longest wilderness section of the AT and its difficulty should not be underestimated.” Well, I got 6 days worth of food and am clumsy as fuck, so here goes nothing I guess. Lol 
Today there were like 4 different rivers/streams that you had to ford, so my shoes were soaked all day. My pack feels super heavy too. I can feel all the weight in my knees. I rationed my food with little room for error, which really means no snacking. I like snacking. And when I put restrictions on my snacking, it just makes me crave food even more. 
At the shelter/campsite tonight it’s me, Potato, Kidska, Hot Sauce, Zoom Zoom, Torino, Spider, and Sparky. This is my first time meeting Hot Sauce, who by the way is one of the most charismatic people I’ve met on trail and he carries a full bottle of sriracha sauce, obviously. Lol. Shortly after introducing himself though, I watched him in what nearly looked like slow motion knock over his cooking stove and dump his entire, untouched dinner into the dirt. You could hear a unison gasp run through the campsite. We’ve all done that at least once. But to lose a full dinner on your first night in the 100 MW is extra shitty. You can only ration so well. Almost immediately though, everyone started digging through their food bags to see what we could spare. That’s when I realized that almost all of us are carrying an “emergency ramen” - one extra, lightweight packet of ramen just in case shit hits the fan. And for Hot Sauce it did. So thank god for ramen! Lol","Monson, ME

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599782,"Today wasn’t even that big of a day in miles, but I’m exhausted. It was just a lot of PUDs over the “Chairbacks”, these steep up and down peaks. Looks like tomorrow is gonna be pretty similar, but after that the terrain gets a lot nicer until Mt Katadhin. 
Ran into a guy today on top of a mountain that I hadn’t seen since New York, over 600 miles ago! Major Tom is his name. That’s one cool thing about taking a zero day every now and then. You start seeing a whole lot of new faces, people that have just been barely behind you the whole time. And then sometimes you run into people you met ages ago, and whether you were friends with them or not it’s still a cool surprise. 
One thing I’m noticing about this “100 Mile Wilderness” business is that it’s really not all that “wildernessey”. The AT still has a lot of road crossings out here. It’s just that all these dirt roads are privately owned and don’t lead into any towns. But there’s still lots of teen camp groups out here and weekend warriors. They just had to pay a fee to get on the dirt roads and access the trail at different points. So the only real difference between this section of the trail and the rest of the AT is that you can’t dip off trail every other day and get a soda and gas station sandwich. Lol Thus the “ominous” appeal of the 100 MW has officially died.","Long Pond Shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599783,"Super humid, muggy morning. Had to do a long and gradual 6.5 mile climb up to Gulf Hagas Mt. Then up and over a lot of peaks all day. The mosquitoes are BAD out here. I haven’t seen them this bad since Massachusetts. I was warned and the reputation holds. Literally killing me. 
I checked out the tread on the bottom of my hiking boots today for the first time, and WOW. What tread? Lol. No wonder I’m slipping all the time! They’re smoother than my 3 yr old Converse. Luckily, I ordered new shoes online when I was in town and have them waiting for me in Harpers Ferry, WV. Most people go through 3-4 pairs of shoes on their thru-hike, so replacing them every 500-600 miles. I have over 1,100 miles on this pair of boots! Lol My goal was to only use 2 pairs of shoes on the whole trip because I’m cheap AF. You can almost see my big toe poking through on the right one, but good god these shoes are gonna get me to Katadhin if it kills me!
Oh speaking of, I saw her today - Big K. On the north side of White Cap Mt is the first time any AT thru-hiker gets a glimpse of her. It’s a straight 72 mile line of sight to Mt Katadhin. And there’s no question about what mountain it is because it’s the biggest fucking mountain across the whole landscape. This view is an emotional moment for most thru-hikers. It’s the FIRST time you can actually see the FINISH LINE. In clear view! Hikers who have literally been walking for months and months finally get to White Cap Mt and can visually see the end of their journey just a handful of days away. I didn’t cry, mainly because it’s not my finish line. But just standing there, you could feel the tear-soaked rocks on that peaks. Since I’m flip-flopping, it wasn’t a super emotional moment for me, but very symbolic nonetheless. Because I’ve still walked a long fucking way. And to tangibly see what I’ve been walking towards this whole time gave me goosebumps. If someone had told me a year ago I’d be standing on a mountain in Maine basking at a view of Katadhin, I wouldn’t have believed them. 
Tonight at the shelter there’s literally no one else here, but me. I’ve never seen this happen. I thought Potato and Kidska would be here, but looks like they pushed ahead. Since I have the entire shelter to myself, I decided to set up my tent inside of it! Lol I wouldn’t have bothered with the tent, but since the shelters are open to the elements on one side and there’s so many god damn mosquitoes, it’d be absolutely suicide to not have some kind of bug net around you. So I’m using my tent and taking over the whole place. Lol","West Pleasant River campsite

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599784,"Didn’t sleep too well because there was a mouse doing laps across the top of my tent all night. I was super paranoid he was gonna chew a whole through my pack trying to get at my toothpaste or smelly cooking pot, but luckily all is well. Lol
Today was a big day in miles, but relatively “easy” in terrain. It was pretty flat for Maine, but not actually flat, flat. Instead of climbing over mountain peaks, it was a lot of rock and root hurdling. And it wasn’t rainy or super sunny, but the humidity was SO high it was essentially impossible to stay hydrated. I’ve never sweated so much on such a cloudy, overcast day.  
The mosquitoes have officially reached a whole other level. I can’t even stop on trail for a snack break without getting absolutely devoured. I spent most of the day running from bugs. It was my biggest motivator to not stop moving. There’s nothing more uncomfortable though than trying to do your business in the woods and having mosquitoes bite your but the whole time. I have at least 11 mosquito bites on my ass!
I’m so fucking hungry. Lol I should have packed out more food instead of the absolute bare minimum. It’s Friday and I’ve already started dipping into Sunday’s rations, which means I’m just gonna have to hike further tomorrow in order to get out of these woods sooner. I’ve literally been on an all peanut butter diet these past couple days. Mainly because it’s filling and I have a lot of it on me. In the morning, I spread it on my granola bars. In the afternoon, I spread it on flour tortillas. And in the evening, I drop a glob of it in my instant Ramen. Peanut butter noodles. Lol
I caught up with Potato and Kidska mid day. We’re the only ones staying at tonight’s shelter. And since it’s a brand new shelter and pretty big, all three of us are able to set up our tents inside it and escape the bugs. 
Several days ago at a campsite, a big group of us were talking about how weird it’s gonna feel to adjust back into “society”. There’s so many things we do as hikers that you just can’t get away with in the “real world”. Like bladder control! Out here, when you gotta go, you HAVE to go. Like you have about a 2 minute window - tops! And since you can go pretty much anywhere, it’s not a huge problem. But in town, it’s a lot more challenging. Lol Also, on trail, 90% of people’s conversations are either about food, poop, or a combination of the two. It’s also one of the only places where it’s acceptable to pick at the dead skin on your feet while people are cooking their dinner. Or eat over 1,000 calories before 8am without judgement. Or shoot snot rockets while hiking. Or ring out the sweat in your socks at camp. Or ask to borrow someone’s mirror to check your nether region for ticks. Or compete with someone on who can go the longest without a shower. Or ask someone if your armpits smell like ammonia (a sign of degrading muscle tissue). Lol The list goes on.","East Branch Shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599785,"Slow start today because we woke up to thunderstorms. There was so much mud on the trail. Still crushed the miles though! Hiked 25 miles, 9:30am to 8pm. That’s 2 BIG days in a row, so my body feels like it’s dying. All day I just kept thinking, “Gotta get to FOOD!!” The 100 MW “ends” at Abol Bridge because there’s a little camp store there that the AT passes by. It’s only 3 miles away from where I’m currently staying, so I’ll reach it in the morning. The camp store is the only thing on my mind lately. It’s probably just a hole-in-the-wall snack shack that sells soda and chips, but I would sell my soul for a family sized bag of BBQ potato chips right now. 
Spent the day hiking on and off with Potato and Kidska. While eating lunch, we met another thru-hiker named Bird. A third thing that hikers LOVE to talk about besides food and poop is their GEAR. Especially the ultra-light or light-weight backpackers. These are people who have a base pack weight less than 15 lbs (not including food, water, or fuel). Potato, Kidska, and Bird are these people, so they had lots to talk about. I am not that person and never will be. I currently have a base weight of 20 lbs (started at 29 lbs though) and I love all those 20 lbs. Lol I like my 20 degree sleeping bag, my two-person tent, my aluminum cooking pot, my big fuel canister, my “sleeping” clothes... I like it all!! A sense of COMFORT is gonna get me through this trail, not a super light pack. Lol
It just occurred to me that I only have 2 more days of hiking in Maine! And then it’s back to the south. I’m looking forward to Virginia though, and the rest of the states. I’m reallyyyyy looking forward to the trail actually looking like a TRAIL again.

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599786,"I didn’t sleep at all last night. Sometimes my body is so sore all over that no matter what position I lay in everything just physically aches. It was definitely one of those nights.
A lot of us stayed at Hurd Brook campsite last night: me, Potato, Kidska, Bird, Spider, Torino, Zoom Zoom, and Hot Sauce. It’s the last shelter in the 100 MW, which means it’s the last shelter outside of Baxter State Park. Pretty much everyone was gone already when I woke up. There’s a lot of logistics involved in entering Baxter as a thru-hiker and planning your summit of Katadhin. For instance, there’s only ONE free campsite/shelter (The Birches) within Baxter that is reserved for AT thru-hikers, but it only takes in 12 people a night and it’s a “first come first served” basis. So usually on this day everyone is literally racing to the park to claim their spot. If you don’t get a spot then you’ll have to throw down some money ($40-$120) to stay at a campsite or cabin, assuming they’re not all booked up for the summer. The second thing you have to do is visit the ranger station and get a permit to hike Katadhin. Yes, you literally have to get a card to climb a mountain because for environmental reasons they only let a certain number of people a year hike it. The cap-off is in the thousands and has so far never been reached, but still the fact that someone could tell you “Sorry, you can’t climb this year” is a little stressful. I’m number 1,195!
I was in no hurry to get to the park this morning, but I was definitely doing a 3 mile sprint to get out of the woods and to that camp store. I got to the store at 9am and bought BBQ potato chips and a root beer for breakfast. Lol Options were very limited. It was basically a “pantry” compared to the gas stations I’m used to resupplying at. Luckily I just needed to buy enough snacks to get me through today and then up the mountain tomorrow. I’ll be in Milinocket, ME by tomorrow night. 
The next 10 miles into Baxter State Park were essentially a “walk in the park”. It was amazing. The trail followed the edge of a river the whole way. The river was full of big boulder slabs and swimming holes with shallow, sandy bottoms. I eventually realized that this was my last opportunity to swim in Maine, and since there were no leaches in sight, I jumped in! Spent more time swimming today than hiking, which was a nice change. Really tried to enjoy the chill day because tomorrow is totally gonna kick my ass. That’s one thing the trail has taught me so far. Enjoy the little moments. Appreciate the small things. Like good weather, the company of strangers, a healthy body. Or a running faucet, flushable toilet, hot shower, real food. It gives you an entirely different perspective on what matters in life and what you really need to be happy and content. 
Eventually, I made it to the center of the park, claimed my spot at The Birches shelter, and got my permit to hike Katadhin for tomorrow. There is WAY less people at The Birches tonight than I was expecting. I was expecting to see all the same faces from last night’s shelter, but it looks like the majority of them pushed ahead and decided to summit Katadhin TODAY. Which is insane because climbing Katadhin is like an all-day thing. You ideally wanna start at the base around 7-8am, not 2pm in the afternoon! But more power too them I guess. I just thought I’d get to see some of them one more time. 
At The Birches tonight it’s me, Kidska, Potato, Durwood, and a guy named Maple Tree —> And get this, I met Maple Tree just one other time and it was in Pennsylvania over 2 months ago! It took us a bit to piece together how/why we recognized each other. But damn, I met him on like my 8th day out here. Lol Crazy stuff. 
The trail is about to get SO different for me. Like everything is gonna change. And not just the terrain, but the people and the mental hike itself. I’ll never have any more moments like this where I run into familiar faces. This is my last night Northbound. Every NoBo I’ve ever met up until now, I’ll never see again. Every NoBo that was ahead of me is already done at this point and off trail. I feel like I’m about to completely start over from the very beginning. 
Potato already thru-hiked the whole AT last year and just came back this summer to re-hike New York through Maine, so he’ll be going home after Katadhin. Kidska is a 23 yr old flip-flopper like myself, but she’s taking a week off trail to visit family before she flips down south. And since I’m going directly back to Harpers Ferry, I’ll be a week ahead of her and we’ll likely never cross paths again. The trail is about to change SO drastically for me and in so many ways. And I’m not sure how I feel about it yet. It’s exciting, but also terrifying. This trail is more about the people than any of the mountains or views. Interactions with people on trail are always very fleeting, yet very genuine. Every time you meet someone, it’s likely you’ll never see them again. You can be hiking with someone every day for weeks and then one day the trail separates you both and that’s it. It’s a sad reality of the trail, but it also makes you appreciate all those little interactions with others. It highlights the value of community while also forcing you to be extremely independent and self-supporting. I don’t know man, Trail Life is a weird and unique thing. And I’m just along for the ride.","Hurd Brook Shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599787,"Today was THE day. I climbed Mt Katadhin!
It’s so hard to put into words what that was like. It was surreal. Katadhin is the biggest and baddest mountain on the whole trail. It’s a 5 mile climb at 5,267ft. It was like Mt Moosilauke on steroids. It had some steep inclines like the Wildcat Peaks. It had strong winds like Mt Washington. It had a lot of Mahoosuc Notch boulder hopping. It was like a giant blend of all the hard shit I’ve done up until now. Halfway up the mountain I had to strap my trekking poles to my backpack and just start climbing. You definitely use your hands just as much as your feet. I killed it though. I left the base at 8:30am and got to the top a little before noon. I passed dozens and dozens of day hikers, which was a big ego boost. Lol
It was the hardest mountain I’ve climbed yet, but the first time I felt super capable in what I was setting out to do. Like when you’ve made it this far, what’s one more 5,000ft climb. Instead of dreading the hike, I enjoyed it. Whether NoBo, SoBo, or Flip-Flopper, it’s a huge moment for any AT thru-hiker. It’s emotional. It’s overwhelming. It’s monumental. And I felt that. I’m doing shit out here every day that I never thought I was capable of achieving. Every night I go to sleep and can’t help but think DAMN, I did today. That’s a great feeling. 
The top of the mountain was in a super windy cloud, so no great views. But still got a kickass pic to prove I was there! I hung out at the summit for about an hour waiting for Potato and Kidska to get there. They slept in. Lol We got a great group photo though with the summit sign. It was crazy how many people were up there though. There’s lot of different trails you can take up the mountain besides the AT, which many consider to be the hardest route. The other trails make the mountain a lot more accessible to kid camp groups and stuff, so it was a little overwhelming to see so many middle school boys. Lol
Around 1pm I started making my way back down the mountain. The decent takes nearly as long as the accent. Every step is really technical. I took the Abol Trail down though because it’s a little shorter and thus a little faster and I was REALLY hungry. All I could think about was a Subway 20 Miles away in Milinocket. Took me 2 hitches to get there, but I did it! And I feasted. 
Kidska and Potato eventually showed up. We ate our celebratory foot-long subs, got snacks at Family Dollar, then walked to Katadhin Inn & Suites to split a motel room for the night. There were several options on where to stay for the night, but we chose this place for the promise of a pool and hot tub! You know you’re staying in a “hiker town” when there’s a sign posted above the pool stating “For the courtesy and health of all our guests, please shower before using pool or hot tub”... LOL! I just about died! With no bathing suites and no shower in over a week, we jumped right in that pool in our hiking shorts and bras. Long live the hiker trash!
Later that evening, I did eventually shower and take advantage of the coin-operated laundry room. Most hostels give you “loaner clothes” for you to wear while you wash all your hiking clothes. But since we’re staying at a motel, you just get a towel. Lol So while chilling in the hallway of this motel wearing a towel and waiting for my laundry, you won’t believe who comes sauntering around the corner. With the same scraggly beard and super corny smile, it was my long lost buddy and hiking partner - SKYWALKER. I legit almost cried. Lol We got separated over a month ago and I thought for sure I’d never see him again. And then there’s TODAY. My LAST day on trail as a NoBo. The LAST chance we’d EVER have in crossing paths again and here he is! This trail is the freakiest force of nature and I fucking love it!! We sat on a bench and talked until midnight, recapping everything we had been through from the day we got separated. We hiked the same piece of trail over the past month, but had two entirely different experiences. Lol I still can’t believe we just ran into each other. What a perfect little reunion to finish the northern half of the AT with. This journey has been so hard and so challenging, but also so rewarding, memorable, and absolutely incredible. And thankfully, it’s not over yet!

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600443,"So Monday was Katadhin. 
On Tuesday I spent most of the day with Kidska and Potato. We ate breakfast at the hotel then went back upstairs and napped until checkout at 11am. Then we went and hung out at the McDonalds down the street and etched out a plan to get from Milinocket to Bangor (60 miles). My flight was gonna be out of Bangor the next day and they both had buses to catch there. We decided to try and hitch the whole 60 miles. I had very little faith in the whole operation. It was about to rain, so I kept trying to convince them to just split a $100 Lyft with me. But they’re cheap AF. Cheaper than me surprisingly. So I entertained the idea with them for a bit. And glad I did because by the end of the day, we all got to Bangor completely free!
It took only two hitches. The first ride picked us up instantly and took us about halfway. It was an older white guy with a truck who played classical music the whole way there and talked about his long, lost dream of being a musician and joining a touring orchestra. Lol The second hitch was also from an old white guy with a truck, but it took some effort. We made a sign out of an old pizza box that said “BANGOR!” and stood along a busy access road, twirling our trekking poles in the air. Hitching is hard enough, and when you got 3 people it takes even longer. Took us about 40 mins to get a ride, but we did it! Little thanks to me though. I was bitching the whole time. It was hot. Lol The guy who picked us up made sure to tell us that he never picks up hikers. Kept calling us a bunch of “granolas”. While driving, he FaceTimed his wife, who he called a “hippie”, and told her how proud she should be of him for giving us a lift. Lol What. 
However, the guy did drive me directly to the airport, which was nice. I said my final goodbyes to Kidska and Potato, and then we all went our separate ways. It was 4:30pm and my flight wasn’t until 6am the following morning. Since my flight was so early, I didn’t wanna pay for a motel and just figured I’d sleep at the airport instead. Solid plan. Except I go to the counter to check-in with United and no one is there. I ask the attendant at the Delta counter where all the United people are and the guy just stares at me and says “You’re not from around here are you?...” Dude, I’m at a fucking AIRPORT. NO I’M NOT FROM HERE! Apparently, Untied people go home at 4pm, so I couldn’t check my bag and go through security until they returned at 4am the following day. Minor set back. I quickly became content with sleeping in the airport lobby. That was until I got a text at 10pm saying that my flight was CANCELED due to “air traffic control”. What the actual fuck. 
Long story short, I ended up not being able to fly out of Maine until Thursday (Today) at 1pm. I did spend the night at the airport on Tuesday, which was an experience for the books. I befriended a nice security guard who sat with me until I refigured my flight plans and then showed me the quietest and warmest part of the airport to sleep in. #Love. Wednesday I stayed at a motel in Bangor and watched a lot of shitty TV. All I could think about was how badly I wanted to be hiking. Today I finally flew back to Harpers Ferry, but not after getting fondled by a TSA agent. They did my body scan in the little machine and then pulled me to the side. This old, white lady looks at me and says “We got a red flag in the crotch location, so I’m gonna have to do an inner groin pat down using the back of my hands. Do you want to move to a private location for this?” ... Wait? WHAT. I was fucking speechless. And so confused. I’m literally wearing running shorts with no underwear! I told her to just get it over with. It was tempting to not make sexual noises the whole time. Lol Fuck TSA. 
Staying at The Teahorse Hostel tonight in Harpers Ferry. It’s weird staying at a hostel without other thruhikers around. The only other people here are two middle-aged women who just hiked the AT for a couple days and then a father and son on a biking trip from DC. During peak season, this place is packed with thruhikers, but since I’m currently the only one everyone is treating me like a celebrity. One of the women told me “You aren’t my daughter, but you should know I am so proud of you.” Lol! They’re all really nice. 
Excited to get back on trail tomorrow. Even though I was only off for 3 days, it feels like it’s been forever. I’ve never taken more than one day off at a time. I’m worried my body is just gonna crack in half when I start hiking again. Lol South, here I come!","Milinocket, ME

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600444,"Today was a pretty productive day. Left the hostel in a breakfast food coma. Then, stopped by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy on my way out of town. I visited the ATC my first day on trail, so going back there felt like an episode of the Twilight Zone. I got my picture taken in front of the sign for a 2nd time to prove that I flipped the flop! They take every thruhikers picture and add it to a big binder with their name, trail name, start date, hiking direction, and contact info. I pulled out a binder on the shelf from May of this year and looked up my original photo. I looked so clean and naive. Lol. I started thumbing through the pages and saw SO many familiar faces. All NoBos that I eventually met along the way. And some people that I had almost forgotten about. I took pictures with my phone of all the pages, so that I could finally have their REAL names (not just trail names) in hopes of looking them up online later. 
Got to pick up my new hiking boots that I got mailed to the center. They’re so shiny! It’ll be nice to walk through a puddle now and not have your socks get immediately soaked through all the holes in your shoes. Lol
At the ATC, I also chatted it up with an older guy named Dave who works there. He didn’t remember me (because he meets thousands of hikers a year), but I remembered him. He was super chatty, but super nice. He asked me so many questions: What was your favorite day? What was your worst day? Favorite trail town? Etc. I decided that my favorite day was either hiking Mt Katadhin or Mt Moosilauke, or the moment I realized I could hike 26 miles in one day and not die. Lol. My worst day was probably the day I got lost going down Mt Madison in “The Whites” of NH and fell 6 miles off trail for about 5 hrs. That was a day. My favorite town stop was definitely probably staying at The Yellow Deli in Rutland, VT. With all the hikers he talks to everyday, he seemed so invested in MY hike. It was nice to relive some of those moments with someone, especially someone who had been through all the same trail. 
Left town around noon. It feels SO good to be back in the woods. Everything is extremely different though. I’m used to watching gradual changes through the trail, while slowly moving state to state. But to jump from Maine to West Virginia, it’s like night and day. The trees are different. The bird songs are different. The HEAT is so real. Like it is capital H.O.T. And the trail, OMG. It’s like walking through Central Park. No more giant mountains, root hurdles, rock walls - just rolling hills baby. I knocked out 16 miles in 6 hrs. It’s amazing! 
However, South Con: lots of insects that will sting you! I got stung on the back of the leg today by a wasp. Or maybe a hornet. I didn’t really turn around and look. Just felt my leg light on fire and started sprinting down the trail screaming obscenities. 
Another kind of downside is that it feels like no one is really out here. I only met 2 thruhikers today and they were headed north, so it was for like half a second. Dave told me I’d probably run into some late NoBos. These are people that intend to do only half the trail this season or people that will soon flip up to Maine and hike south from there. It’s just weird now staying at a huge campsite by myself. Like this would have never happened before. It’ll take some time getting used to it for sure.","Harpers Ferry, WV

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600445,"I planned for today to be a short day because I knew I was gonna have to tackle the infamous “AT Rollercoaster”. Lol I’d heard about it back in May at the beginning of my trek because I had met some NoBos who had just gone through it. It’s 13.5 miles of purposefully-planned ascents and descents. You know you’re about to enter it because there’s a sign on a tree that says: “Hiker Warning: You are about to enter the AT Rollercoaster built and maintained by The Trailboss and his crew of volunteers. Have a great ride!” In all honesty, it wasn’t a big deal. It was more annoying than challenging. I mean up is up and it’s always a bitch. But compared to everything I went through in Maine and New Hampshire, I would gladly hike this “rollercoaster” every damn day if I had too. I’ll never again be able to justifiably complain about the trail. Lol
The rollercoaster crossed several big roads and, since it’s Saturday, there were day hikers everywhere. After I crossed this busy road, this guy ran up to me and was like “I just hiked to this crossing and saw you come from the other side. Does it keep going across the street?” I said yes. “And where does it end?” “Umm, Maine..?” Lol! Gotta love those day hikers. I will say though I saw a BEAR today and it was only because a group of day hikers were standing on the side of the trail and pointing off into the woods. I would have blazed right by it if they hadn’t pointed it out to me. 
I also met a couple section hikers and a few of those backwards flipfloppers. One guywas named Sideshow Joe. I wanted to ask how he got that name, but considering the big nose and blonde Afro I figured it was self explanatory. Lol. Everyone was walking north though, so just hi and bye. No one at the shelter I stopped at for lunch. No one at the shelter I’m staying at tonight. It all feels pretty lonely, like I’m starting over and having to do it all by myself. No handy NoBos around to untangle my bear rope from a tree or show me how to properly stake my rainfly. 
Just me now.","Sand Springs campsite

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600798,"Today started out super hot and humid, but then it stormed for awhile this afternoon which actually felt really nice. First time in awhile that I was thankful for the rain. 
I saw one of the strangest things on trail today. I walked up on 3 middle-aged white dudes driving their remote-controlled, TOY monster trucks right through the trail. One of the trucks was carrying a crushed beer can on a string behind it. Another had a rock chained onto the bed of it. They were just cruising them along over the rocks and mud. One would flip over, so they’d stop, readjust it, and keep going. It took everything in me to not ask what the fuck they were doing with their Sunday morning. Lol! I couldn’t help but think, only in the south!
South Pro: There are some bomb ass shelters/campsites down here. Almost every one has a picnic table - real luxury. Saw one the other day with a porch swing! And tonight I’m staying at one with a reclining wooden bench and a rain-barrel solar-operated shower! I might as well be staying at the Holiday Inn. Lol
South Con: Thorns! I keep running into thorny vines and overgrowth hanging over the trail. And It hurts.
South Pro: I can sleep in, take long breaks throughout the day, and still crush the miles! Started hiking at 9am, took an hour lunch break, then took an hour dinner break by hitching 1.5 miles down the road to a farmers market store where I found a 12in VEGAN peach pie!! Whooo!! I ate half of it right there and then packed out the other half for tomorrow’s breakfast. That thing probably weighed a solid 2-3 lbs. Lol Definitely the most ridiculous thing I’ve packed out on trail, but SO worth it.  
In all honesty, I was in a bit of a funk today. The lack of people out here, thruhikers specifically, is starting to get to me. Like it’s lonely AF. Without people around to motivate you through the day and hold you accountable for each mile, it’s easy to wanna ask yourself why the hell you’re still out here? Dipping into towns and eating good food is always a little morale booster. But sometimes it just feels like I’m hiking from one convenient store to the next. Like that’s my big motivation to keep hiking each day. And that’s sad. Lol
I actually carry a list with me stating all the reasons I set out to do the trail, what I’ll gain from it, and what I’ll lose if I quit. I made it before I came out here. I have yet to read it though on trail. I keep putting it off because I feel like the day I have to bust out “The List” will signify the day I have officially cracked. And I refuse to admit I’m there yet. Lol
I do remember one of the things I’d hoped to gain on trail and that was learning to be alone. And not just learning to tolerate loneliness, but learning to THRIVE within it. Right now though, since it’s only my 3rd day southbound, I think I’m still in the initial shock phase. As more time passes hopefully I’ll adjust. 
Had a bit of a time warp just now at the shelter. I was looking at the shelter’s log book/register to see if I recognized any names of hikers who had passed through. I flipped to the first page of the book and was shocked to see a dozen different NoBos’ names I recognized all dated around mid-May (CraftE, Spider, Steady, Sunshine, Chili Dog, Sherlock, Honeybun, Slider, Mr Peanut Butter, etc). They all left various messages and comments about their hike/day. Apparently, it was raining when a lot of them passed through, just like now... Oh how the soul and spirit of the NoBo bubble lives on through this damp and humid August day.","Rod Hollow shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600799,"Today was a nice cool, overcast day. Thundered a lot, but no rain. Last night, it was just me and one other person at the shelter. An older woman named Lisa, probably in her early 60s. She had long, gray hair down to her middle back. She wore waterproof hiking boots, blue jeans (soaked from the previous day), and 2 backpacks (day-pack in the front and nearly a 50lbs hikers backpack in the back). From the prospective of thruhikers, she was a disaster. She claimed to have section hiked a lot of the AT over the years. I woke up this morning to the sound of her making bird calls from the shelter each time a bird tweeted... Lol. 
After eating the other half of my peach pie for breakfast, I hit the trail. South Pro: switchbacks are back!! Probably one of the greatest ingenuities in the world. I hadn’t seen a mountain with switchbacks since Vermont, but Virginia is FULL of them.  South Con: Cobwebs to the face all day. On trail, people call the early risers (those who start hiking by 6am or earlier) “webbers”. It’s because the earliest people on trail in the morning are the ones that knock down all the cobwebs for the rest of us. But since hardly anyone is hiking in the south right now, I’m getting mouthfuls of cobwebs all morning even though I’m not hiking until 9am! Lol
Today was a resupply day, so I dipped into Front Royal, VA for about 3hrs.  Chatted with the folks at Family Dollar for about half an hour. They were all super nice and super interested in what I was doing. Southern hospitals is real down here. Then, I went over to this Thai restaurant where I got a tofu and vegetable stirfry dish. Even though it was fried, it was probably one of the healthiest things I’ve eaten on trail yet. Lol 
I saw in the guidebook that there was something downtown called the Front Royal Brewing Co and they happened to offer showers and laundry services to hikers for free?? It all sounded a little too promising, but I made the extra steps to go check it out. Turns out, it’s this super nice, hiker-friendly pub owned by this woman who is in the middle of doing all this remodeling so that the pub better serves hikers. SO cool, right! Unfortunately, she said I was about one week too early. They still have contractors finishing up the shower/laundry room. She gave me a tour of everything and asked for my input on different ideas. One of the things she was really excited about was this huge “hiker mural” she’s commissioning this artist to do. She doesn’t know exactly what he’s going to paint yet, but he asked for pictures of hiker’s shoes to get inspiration. So she took like ten photos of me and my feet to send to this guy. Lol Very cool place and very cool people. 
Down the street was a coffee shop with WiFi that I’d figured I’d chill at and get caught up on some blogging for a bit. As soon as I got situated though, I heard a huge crack of thunder come rolling in. I didn’t wanna be trying to hitch a ride back to the trailhead in the pouring rain, so I scrambled my stuff together and made a dash for the road. I got picked up pretty quickly, and then was back in the trees. 
The thunder was loud, but it actually never rained. I officially crossed into Shenandoah National Park today. And just moments after, I saw a black bear about 40ft up in a tree! I heard they were good climbers, but DAMN. The only reason I saw him is because I could hear his claws scrapping the side of the tree as he slid all the way down and then instantly sprinted into the woods. Last time I saw a bear was like in New Jersey, so that was a nice surprise.
Just me and some random at the shelter/campsite tonight. And older guy, looked like a section hiker. I said hello, but he was less than responsive. So tenting by myself next to a stream. There’s these little black flies in VA that have been absolutely devouring me. They’re not like the big black flies in Vermont. They’re about the size of a gnat, but they bite! And I am just covered in scars and scabs from scratching too much in my sleep. It’s pretty brutal. Lol","Jim & Molly Denton shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600800,"Weather was super nice and cool today. And guess what, I saw another bear! They’re very protected within Shenandoah National Park. The trail goes through the park for another 4-5 days, so I assume I’ll probably see even more. 
Another thing that’s awesome about SNP, is all the amenities that come with it! About once a day, I’ll be passing a campground store that sells snacks or something called a “Wayside” that’s like a short-order grill. So lots of opportunities for food the next couple of days! I stopped at a Wayside for lunch and was able to get a black bean veggie burger! SNP is gonna take all my money over the next week. Lol
Had to do a 2.5 mile hike up this large hill to get to tonight’s shelter/campsite. It was technically a mountain, but compared to what I’ve seen I don’t think I can justifiably call it a mountain. Still exhausting though. I don’t like doing that shit at the very end of the day. But what was even more infuriating was the fact that the water source for the shelter was 0.4 miles DOWNHILL. So once you hiked all the way up the freaking mountain, you had to take a small side trail back DOWN just to get water. That’s a 0.8 mile round trip. Thruhikers don’t do that shit - EVER. I was pissed. And obviously still am. Lol
No one else here tonight besides me, so I set up my tent in the shelter. This shelter actually has a freaking fireplace! Never seen that before. 
A deer scared the holy hell out of me just now. I heard the breathing and movements of a large animal moving around the outside corner of the shelter. I beamed my headlamp that direction and saw two huge glowing eyes! Just a deer though. Lol Turns out, all he wanted was to come lick up the toothpaste I had just spit onto the ground!

I’ve heard a lot of stories about people getting bluff charged by defensive mama bears, so I was a little on edge. But she didn’t seem bothered by me at all. I was able to get a video of her and also one of her cubs climbing up in a tree. Legit looked like a little cute ass awkward teddy bear. Lol
Passed by another Wayside today for lunch. Except this one wasn’t a short-order grill, but rather The “Skyland Resort and Restaurant”. Oooo! Lol I spent $12 on this super small veggie wrap. I got GOT. Didn’t even put a dent in my appetite. 
Met two other thruhikers there! As I was walking up to the place, I see this guy and girl waving and yelling at me from a bench outside. At first I thought maybe they knew me somehow? Turns out, they were just excited to see another thruhiker. And god, so was I! First thruhikers I’ve actually gotten to meet since I’ve started walking south!! Their names were Firey Goat and Little Bear. I asked them what direction they were headed and they said North. I asked if they were going all the way and they said yes. After an awkward pause, I couldn’t help but ask, “Sooo, you really think you’re gonna make it in time?” Lol. They both laughed. They seemed to be aware that there was no way they’d make it to Katadhin by Oct 15th, but they hadn’t exactly decided on when and where they were gonna flip up north. Straggling NoBos are a thing. Lol
It was really great talking with them. Too bad we’re headed in opposite directions. They said that they’ve met a handful of thruhikers headed south that are probably just a day or two ahead of me, so I might meet some more people soon. Before we parted ways, Little Bear saw how mutilated my arms and legs were from scratching, so he gave me his whole tube of After Bite ointment. Lol God bless. 
I ended up hanging out in the lobby of this restaurant for awhile. Making phone calls and talking with friends. Before I knew it, it was 4pm and I had zero motivation to hike. Lol I re-evaluated the day’s plans and decided I just wouldn’t go as far. I’m staying at Big Meadows Campground tonight, which is actually an official SNP campsite that you technically have to pay $20 to use. Each camp spot has its own tent pad, bear box, fire pit, and picnic table. I waited until 8pm to throw my tent up, so that hopefully no one would notice I’m here. Because I’ll be damned if I have to pay that $20 when I just walked over 1,200 miles to get to this point. Lol
I think I’ll try and make up the mileage tomorrow. It’s so hard to be motivated to hike some days. It’s even harder not being surrounded by other thruhikers to motivate me. It’s starting to make hiking feel like such a chore. I keep trying to remind myself that I don’t HAVE to hike. I GET to hike. No one is making me do this. I worked really hard for several years, so that I could make this hike a reality. Before I came out here, I used to tell myself that soon I wouldn’t have to worry about a job, deadlines, bills, drama, etc. My biggest worry every day would just be hiking from one destination to the next. And all things considered, that’s a pretty easy life. I like to think that a year from now when this is all over and I’m back in the concrete jungle working some 9-5 job, I’ll probably be staring at the walls of my apartment and really be missing these woods.","Birds Nest #3 shelter

But no one ever came! Saw a lot of wildlife while hiking this morning, 2 bears and 2 deer. That’s almost one bear a day now!
Stopped at another SNP camp store today to stock up on snacks. There was another hiker in the store talking to the checkout clerk. I ease-dropped on their conversation, and turns out this guy is ALSO a southbound flipflopper who started in Harper Ferry! I tried not to stare, but I felt like I was about to meet a long lost sibling that I had gotten separated from at birth. Lol
His name is Production, which he says is because he’s kind of dramatic and likes to make a “production” out of things. Lol We chatted and ate snacks for nearly two hours at that camp store. I was so happy to FINALLY meet another flipflopper that was also headed south. We never crossed paths during the northern part of our hike because he started nearly a month before I did, so he was always way ahead. The only reason we were meeting now was because he took a couple weeks off to go home and visit family before starting the southern half. We talked a lot about our different trail experiences up until this point, how much of a bitch Maine was, and how happy we were to finally be in Virginia. 
Production had a few setbacks though. At some point in Massachusetts, he contracted Lyme Disease from a tick bite. He was never experiencing any major symptoms though, so he didn’t know he had it until he was home a couple weeks ago and decided to go and get tested on a whim!! And the tests came back positive! So now he has to take medication twice a day for three weeks. The medication makes your skin super sensitive to UV rays though, so he has to hike in long sleeves, long pants, and this dorky sun hat. Lol
Talking to Production about his run in with Lyme Disease has really made me paranoid now. Up until today, I’ve never found a tick on me. But guess what, It’s just my fucking luck that tonight while cooking dinner I looked down at my arm and found a tiny tick embed into my skin!! WTF! I fucking jinxed myself. 
Production and I ended up stealth camping in the same area on top of Hightop Mt tonight. Dinner with a view! When he finally showed up to camp, I yelled at him and told him he was bad luck.

I thought I might see him tonight at camp, but I think I pushed too far ahead. I’ll be zeroing on Sunday, so I assume he’ll catch up. 
I passed through the last SNP Wayside stop today. Without these little snack stops everyday, I don’t know what’s gonna motivate me to hike once I leave the Shenandoahs.

Packed out a bunch of snacks and took them to the top of Blackrock Mt for dinner. Got to see a partial sunset over the mountain.

It’s crazy what you can accomplish when you’re really feeling it. I was just trying to get to town by a decent time. Lol Tonight I’m staying in Waynesboro, VA at a free hiker campsite just on the outskirts of town. Waynesboro is known for being a very hiker-friendly town. The campsite has solar-powered outlets to charge your phone and the YMCA across the street lets hikers shower there for free! 
I met two very interesting people today. The first one was a guy that gave me a ride into town. His name was Shannon and he was 47 yrs old. I don’t know how to describe this guy without making him sound super sketchy and terrifying. But in all honesty, he was really nice. Maybe slightly sketchy, but still a solid dude. Lol He was parked in a parking lot when he saw me standing on the side of the road with my thumb out. He yelled out the window and asked where I was going. He agreed to give me a ride into town if I didn’t mind waiting a couple minutes for his weed to show up. Haha! I didn’t mind. 
I sat in his truck and talked with him while we waited. He told me that he had just gotten this truck from a friend who told him if he could get it to work he could have it. So he fixed the engine, but everything else that could possibly be broken was broken. Lol The ignition didn’t work, so he took it out completely and now uses a screwdriver to start the car. The windshield wipers broke, so he tied a shoelace to the wiper on the driver’s side and sticks his hand out the window and pulls on the shoelace to wipe the windshield when it’s raining! Haha! It was very low class, but simultaneously very impressive. 
He told me all about his wayward lifestyle. Hitch hiking all over the country when he was 17. Joining a traveling circus and getting to live with a group of carnies for a year. Working dozens of temp jobs over the years, but only when he has too. All the different tricks and ways he’s learned to get free food from restaurants or a night’s stay at a church. He was essentially homeless, but doing it very well and seemed happy with it. No wife, kids, or job. He was such a free person. And for someone like myself, currently living on a trail, I was so intrigued by it all. He told me that tomorrow, he’s gonna take this truck and just go. His small bit of belongings was already in the bed of the truck. He plans to go live on Myrtle Beach in South Carolina in one of these day-to-day cash-paid tent sites. He said he was gonna surf, fish, and not give two fucks about anything. Most people probably look at this guy’s lifestyle as a “last resort” kind of life, but to me it just seems like another viable option, evidence that there’s a lot of different ways to do this thing we call LIFE. 
The second person I met was a slightly older woman who’s trail name was Wild Rose. I don’t remember her real name. I was eating dinner by myself at the Chinese buffet in town and she walks up and tells me she just paid for my food! I guess I really do look like a hiker. Lol She proceeds to sit down with me and just chat up a storm. She told me about all the section hiking she’s done on the AT, but how she can only do a handful of miles a day now because she had surgery on both of her knees. She was in the military for 29 years and it put a beating on her body. She kept telling me all these stories abt her on trail in a thunderstorm or nearly having a heatstroke, etc. She made it sound like she nearly died several times. Lol She also really liked to talk about gear (probably my least favorite topic). Told me how her base weight is nearly 10 lbs and how she’s waiting for her super ultra light stove kit to come in mail and blah blah blah. We sat there for nearly an hour talking and I think I only said about four words. I was super grateful to have my meal paid for, but damn she could talk. Lol Eventually, the waitress came by and put fortune cookies on the table, ushering us to get the hell out. 
At the campsite tonight is just me and a different older woman doing some section hiking. I’m hoping more hikers roll in tomorrow afternoon. I’m looking forward to a chill day in town.","Blackrock Shelter

They gave you a towel and small bar of soap, but no shampoo. Washing long hair with a bar of soap is challenging, but I’m almost surprised this is the first time I’ve had to do it. Lol I also got to floss my teeth in front of a mirror and weigh myself on a non-digital scale! Living the high life. 
I didn’t eat breakfast, so by 1pm I was starving. And since I didn’t have to pay for my meal yesterday, it felt appropriate to eat the Ming’s Garden buffet for a second time. I guiltlessly ate all the veggie noodles and spring rolls to my stomach’s content. Then I walked a mile over to the laundry mat and Dollar G. Probably my two favorite places to hangout when coming off trail. Lol
No one else really showed up to the hiker’s campsite in town this evening. It’s weird taking a zero day by yourself. I’m not sure how I feel about it honestly. Kinda itching to get hiking again.
Shout out to my Uncle Larry! It’s his birthday today and he reads these things. Lol It’s also my best manfriend’s birthday Daniel Hammer. He doesn’t read these things, but regardless I love you both!! And hope y’all have a fantastic day!","Waynesboro, VA Hiker Campsite

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601221,"Was really hard to leave town today. Woke up to misty air and thunder in the distance. The post office opened at 9am, so I swung by there on my way out to pick up some packages. One of them was another highly anticipated care package from my Uncle Larry and Aunt Pat. Love you guys! The other was the “Southbound version” of the AT guidebook because for the past week I’ve been using the northbound one and just reading the directions backwards and well, that was getting really annoying. 
Got a lift out of town and back to the trailhead around 10am. Even with the late start, I still somehow managed to put some good distance in. Been doing consistent 20 mile days lately. Rain definitely motivates you to keep moving and it rained most of the day. It was also extremely foggy. There was only like a 30yd line of sight through the woods, which made for an eerie hike. 
The little orange salamanders are back! I hadn’t seen them since southern Vermont. Saw more salamanders today than people. Just two older guys passed by me going north this morning. And there’s another old guy at the shelter tonight. I reached camp at 7pm and this guy is already asleep in the shelter with his earplugs in. Not feeling that desperate for a spot, so I’m tenting. 
While hiking, I get a lot of time to myself, which means A LOT of time to think. Sometimes too much time. It’s easy to get stuck in your head out here. Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about post-trail life and what that’s gonna be like. And it all really stresses me out. And I’m not just talking about the “so, what are you gonna do now” question. That’s a whole other stress topic that I don’t want to get into yet. It’s more about people and time. Time out here moves slow. Like really slow, especially when you’re alone. But talking with friends back home makes it seem like the world is moving SO fast out there. And then you realize that people’s lives are moving forward without you everyday. Everyone I know has either moved, gotten a new job, new relationship, or all the above. Part of me wanted to believe that I could just put my relationships with people on hold until I returned. But the world doesn’t just stop when you’re not there. I knew this before coming out here, just everyday it feels more real. I know, I probably sound like some angsty teenager that just needs to be a little less dramatic. But it’s true. After this, nothing is gonna go back to the way it used to be because what it used to be is gone.","Waynesboro, VA Hiker Campsite

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601222,"Woke up to everything wet with pools of water under my tent. Guess I wasn’t camped on as flat of a surface as I thought. UGH. It rained all morning and most of the afternoon. Apparently, this is one of the wettest summers on record for Virginia. 
Virginia started to show its harder side today. Had to hike up The Priest Mt, a good 4,000-footer with a nearly 5 mile ascent. No rock climbing or scrambles though, so I shouldn’t complain. It was just a slow and steady long ass climb. I ran out of water halfway up though like a dumbass, so it made the whole ordeal a lot more painful. On days where water is literally falling from the sky and you and everything you have is soaking wet, it’s easy to forget to actually drink the water. 
At the top of The Priest Mt is The Priest Shelter. This shelter is a traditional stop for all thruhikers. The log book/register at the shelter is treated as “the priest” and every thruhiker must visit “the priest” and confess thy sins. Usually all the confessions have something to do with breaking Leave No Trace principles (LNT, the hiker code of ethics). Reading through that book was hilariously. People had confessed to some absolutely absurd stuff. Every entry began with “Forgive me father, for I have sinned...” and then delved into their terrible act. One girl confessed that even though she had sought out to thruhike the AT to better herself and her mind, all she thought about day to day was beer, food, and sex. Lol Another confessed to peeing down her leg while hiking through a thunderstorm. One guy confessed that after shitting his shorts, instead of packing out the shorts, he buried them. Haha! Definitely not LNT. A lot of people confessed to murdering lots of insects or the occasional “blue-blazing” (side trail shortcuts), etc. I’ll tell you my confession, but it needs some context... I hate public restrooms. I avoid them to the extreme. I can go all day at Disneyworld or a music festival and never touch a bathroom. Port-A-Potties are even worse and I absolutely refuse no matter the emergency. So, that being said, every shelter along the AT has a privy/outhouse near it. And within the thirteen hundred miles I’ve hiked, passing literally hundreds of privies, I have yet to use a single one. Lol So help me god, I will dig a hole every day till the day I die!
Staying at a big secluded campsite just a mile short of the next shelter. I originally planned to hike to that shelter, but with the bad weather I knew at least one person would be there and I just wanted to be by myself tonight. Also, it stopped raining for a bit, so I wanted to give my tent and stuff as much time to air dry as possible. I managed to get my “sleeping clothes” wet the other day (don’t ask), which from my prospective is like the worst thing you can do. So I have no dry clothes to change into. Therefore, I decided that since I’m the only one at this campsite tonight, I’d just spend the evening air drying. So I did. I walked around camp completely naked until nightfall. Lol
Eventually, I took my tent out of the trees and set everything up. Everything is still very wet, but not soaked. So, it kinda helped. The one thing I managed to keep dry is my sleeping bag, thank god. It’s definitely gonna storm some more tonight though. The wind is literally whipping my tent from both sides right now. So much that I had to get out twice and re-stake it because the stakes were getting blown out of the ground! My tent has been through a lot of storms at this point and holds up decently. But when it’s raining and the wind is blowing hard and you’re whole tent lights up with every lightning strike, it’s always completely terrifying. Lol Part of me thinks maybe I should have stayed at the shelter tonight. Yikes. Too late now!","Maupin Field shelter

Today’s hike was pretty chill, just up and down over some peaks. And then a longggg decent down the mountain ridge and into camp. Came across a wild crab apple tree today! Never seen that on trail.
Tonight at camp is me and TWO other southbound flipfloppers! I’ve never been so excited to see two older guys in their 60s who are essentially strangers to me. Lol There names are Buster & Disco. It was nice having dinner with them. They summited Katadhin just 3 days before I did, so they’ve just always been a couple steps ahead of me. They asked me how many miles I did today and I said about 22. Then they both simultaneously said “Well, nice knowin you!” Lol.
We recapped our experiences through the Shenandoahs and then also Maine and New Hampshire. They had nothing nice to say about Virginia. Lol They called it “boring” and “mind-numbing”. Said they missed the views and rock scrambles of Maine. What. Lol I couldn’t help but think, how dare y’all... After everything we went through mentally and physically up north, how dare you both wish upon us all the furry and misery Maine and New Hampshire offers! I will forever kiss the ground I walk on in Virginia. Lol
I asked if they’d met a guy named Production and they said they had and that he’s about a day ahead of us. I hope I run into him again. If I manage to somehow keep up this 20 average, I figure I’ll see him again soon. Tomorrow will be a bit of a shorter day though because I’m dipping into Glasgow, VA and staying in town at a free hiker campsite. 
Tonight’s camp spot is alright, but there’s TONS of tiny black flies here. My body was just starting to heal from the last assassination of bites, but once again I’m literally covered in welts. I know they bite other people too, but I swear my skin has some next-level reaction to these fuckers. Like, god damn. Give me a break!Also, shoutout to everyone who reads these!! It blows my mind to see how many people are keeping up with my journey that I don’t even know! The fact that strangers read my blog and somehow find it entertaining, or dare I say “inspiring”, is beyond flattering.

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601559,"It was a breezy and sunny hike into Glasgow today! The sun was out, but it was just windy enough to where if you stopped for too long of a break the sweat on your back felt really cold! Lol Perfect hiking weather. 
Had to veer off trail to a shelter midday to get water from a spring. Met a real character there. Older guy who goes by the name Starfork. Starfork has long gray hair and one eye. I walked up on him laying piles of orange mushrooms across a picnic table. Said he’d been foraging for mushrooms for 3 days and was now letting them dry out since the weather was nice. I looked around at the campsite, and ya it looked like he’d basically moved in. All of his clothes were hanging on a makeshift clothesline and the whole shelter looked like his own personal cabin. He was definitely living on the trail. Lol
I got a hitch on the road pretty easily. Always do, really. Perks to being a young woman. Lol It was by this 22 yr old guy named Richard who was not only one of the most sincere people I’ve ever met, but he was VEGAN! We geeked out over vegan ethics and extremes through the whole ride. It was magical. So magical I’m kicking myself for not connecting with him on Facebook or Instagram. I would have zeroed to hang with this dude. For sure. Haha. 
Pulling up to Glasgow, VA was interesting. The whole town is just a single street with one restaurant, post office, laundry mat, gas station, auto shop, library, and church. That’s literally the whole town, like seven buildings. Oh, and a Dollar General of course! Lol Richard dropped me off at the one restaurant where I got a veggie sub sandwich and a sweet tea. 
Afterwards, I went to the laundry mat next door. I really wanted to wash ALL of the clothes I have, so I asked a waitress at the restaurant if I could have a big black trash bag. I made myself a super classy trash bag dress to wear why I did my laundry. I didn’t realize that the dress was slightly see-through until I got some weird looks, but regardless it worked! Lol
Then I went through the usual motions at Dollar G and then hung out at the library until it closed. I’m staying at a free hiker shelter/campsite in town tonight. It’s right behind the sandwich shop. Lol It’s a pretty sweet spot. It’s got outlets, a water pump, wooden bunks, and an outdoor shower. I didn’t shower though. It’s only been like 5 days. Too much work. Lol A sign explains that the place was built by some Eagle Scouts and is now maintained by volunteers from the Lutheran church. I can only imagine what this place is like during peak hiking season. I bet it’s a poppin place when all the NoBos are coming through. Unfortunately though, it’s just me here tonight.","Pedlar River campsite

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601560,"Slept terribly last night. I stayed up WAY too late for really no good reason. Like nearly 2am. And the truck stop across the street was pretty noisy all night. And then this skunk kept doing laps around my tent. At one point I felt the skunk set both of his front paws on my leg through the outside of the tent! That’s when I finally got up and decided to hang my food bag instead of sleep with it. Lol
Thus, I was moving slow this morning. It was also pretty chilly last night. It dropped into the 50s. So I didn’t get out of my sleeping bag until like 9am. Lol Buster and Disco came by the shelter this morning to check it out. They stayed in town last night at a hostel and were gonna stay another night and zero for the day. I chatted with them for a bit while waiting for the sub shop to open, so I could get another good meal in before hitting the trail. 
I was feeling super lazy and tired. And very full. Didn’t get back on trail until 1pm. I kinda expected today to be a short day and it really was. Ended up doing a nero out of town. A whole 7 miles! Lol. 
Tonight at camp is me and one other middle aged guy, The Little Green Light. That was his name. Lol He’s also a flipflopper, but he flipped on the trail twice now. So he’s doing it in like three different segments and headed north now. Kinda confusing, but whatever gets it done I guess. We spent a good half hour recapping our different experiences on the trail. Everyone seems to really miss Maine and I just don’t understand that. He was able to recall so many different names of places and mountains and towns. To me, it’s all kinda one giant blur honestly. I remember a lot of stuff, but I couldn’t really say where and when it happened. Lol

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601561,"Today was rough. Consisted of a lot of ups and my stomach was killing me all day. I don’t know if it was food I ate in town yesterday or if I’m getting sick, but it’s not good. And it made hiking today really hard and uncomfortable. I was really hungry, but couldn’t keep any food in me. And the feeling of water in my belly sloshing around while I hiked made me feel queasy all day. I’m surprised I made it as far as I did. I took like a hundred breaks. 
Not only was I experiencing physical aliments today, but I was also losing the mental game again, HARD. I’ve realized that I spend the majority of my time out here hiking alone while thinking about people - people back home and people I’ve met on trail. All my thoughts are consumed with people, but of course here I am. ALONE. I used to look forward to town stops. Like that’s what motivated me from one destination to the next. But I’m realizing that town days are boring without someone to spend them with. Like eating out by yourself is just sad. I’m supposed to be in Troutsville in like 2 days and I don’t even care. 
I’m blaming the “Virginia Blues”. Getting the Virginia Blues is a thing that almost every thruhiker experiences, no matter the direction their hiking. I don’t know what it is, but something about this state sends a lot of hikers into a depressive rut. I think It’s partially due to Virginia just being a really big ass state. Since 1/4 of the whole trail lies in Virginia, it kinda makes it feel like your here forever. Also, the scenery never really changes. It’s 500+ miles of sameness. Virginia really isn’t that difficult of a state to hike and I keep reminding myself of that. But the mental hike is still very real here.... Someone come hike with me!!
Tonight’s shelter is pretty impressive. It’s like massive. Two-stories! Tenting inside of it since I have it all to myself. And going to sleep really early again hoping this bug passes.","Marble Spring campsite

While I was packing up my things, two SoBos walked by. These two guys are the first legit southbounders I’ve met since flipping south. Their names were Mountain Goat and Thing 1. Apparently, there was a Thing 2, but he had to get off trail. Lol These guys started in Maine in early June and are literally at the front end of the pack, so they’re crushing the miles. Averaging 25-30 miles a day through Virginia. They said they really wanna finish in the Top Ten. Not top 10%, but like be one of the top ten SoBos to finish their hike in 2018. It was nice chatting with them for a hot second, but I’ll definitely never see them again. Lol
Today ended up being a weird day. As the day went on and I kept feeling like shit, I continued to reevaluate my plans over and over. My tummy was bouncing with every step and I wanted OUT. I passed two roads today that led into Buchanan, VA. When I hit the first road, I planned to hitch into town real quick and try and find some Pepto-Bismol. But there weren’t any cars headed that direction and the very few that passed didn’t stop. So I decided to walk the opposite direction because I saw there was a campground/RV park about a mile away with a little camp store on site. 
The camp store didn’t have Pepto or anything for stomach relief. But they had the next best thing - Sprite and Saltine crackers. They also had a rec room with a TV and DVD player. Before I knew it, I was lounging in front of the TV watching a romantic comedy, “The Break Up”, drinking sody pop, and doing everything but hiking. Eventually, two girls on a road trip from North Carolina came in. They started talking to me and asking lots of questions about the trail. I told them I wasn’t feeling too hot today and couldn’t really do anything about it since I was in the middle of nowhere. Next thing I know, one of the girls goes out to their car and comes back with some Pepto to-go chewable tablets. And she gives me the whole box! Lol #TheTrailProvides
Eventually, I left that camp store. I climbed a couple miles up a big hill and then lost all motivation again and sat back down. I don’t know what was weighing on me more, the stomach pains or the mental woes. So I pulled out my phone and started calling up the crew. The only one that answered was the trusty Taylor T (love you dude!). Talking to friends helps. I realized today that I’m finally feeling “the two B’s”. “The two B’s” are like the trail version of the name Voldemort. Everyone knows who/what you’re talking about, but you’re never supposed to say it out loud. Well, I’m saying it. I’m BORED and BURNT OUT. And I don’t know what to do about it. 
Taylor reminded me that there’s no reason to be doing something that makes me miserable, especially if I don’t HAVE to do it. He said I have two options: 1) Set my ego and pride aside and quit (we all know that’s not possible), or 2) Find a way to make the trail fun. Whether that’s taking shorter days, or spending multiple days in town, or just doing some part of the daily routine different. I don’t know what that exactly looks like yet, but I think he has a point. 
Later in the day, I reached the second road that leads into Buchanan and, well, I caved. I hitched into town and am staying at the only motel they have, the Wattsull Inn. They have a “hiker rate” for $60 a night, which isn’t bad. I’ve never felt so soft though.

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601722,"So yesterday I spent a lot of time thinking about how to do this hike differently to where I could actually enjoy it. And I learned a lot. I realized that I only have to hike when I feel like hiking. And I only have to go as far as I want to that day. And if I don’t feel like hiking, well then there’s no need to force myself to do it that day. If I wanna take one, two, or three days off in a row, I should be able to do that and not make myself feel guilty for it. Also, that being said, sometimes a day off not only allows your body to recover, but can actually make you miss hiking which is a nice boost. 
The second thing I realized is that this is my hike and I can really hike it however I want too. It’s called HYOH (Hiking Your Own Hike!). For instance, I yellow-blazed 20 miles of trail today and I don’t really give a fuck. Lol Yellow-blazing is when you skip a portion of the trail, usually by hitching between towns. I was in Buchanan this morning and didn’t wanna hike, but there’s absolutely nothing in Buchanan. Like nothing. So I hitched to the next town over that actually has a real grocery store, Troutville, VA (Thanks Gary with the Corvette!). And now I’m gonna spend this 95 degree day eating fresh produce and swinging on swings in the town park. Bite me. 
The third thing I learned is I need to get reintegrated with people out here or I’m gonna lose my god damn mind. And since thruhikers are hard to come by, I’m focusing on town people now. Anyone reading this over the age of 29 is probably gonna think this is sketchy, crass, or just “not safe”, but it’s honestly a genius idea. And it’s working. I downloaded the Tinder app, which is usually used as a dating (or “hook up”) app for young people. I know, “millennials” - gross. Lol I posted a handful of pics of me on trail and a three-sentence bio explaining that I’m hiking the whole AT, I’m passing through Virginia for a bit, and I’m bored AF - let’s hang out! And lots of people my age are hitting me up offering rides, to take me out to lunch, let me do laundry, etc. lol Mostly college students from Virginia Tech. 
Tonight I’m actually staying at a guy named David’s house. He’s 29 and a total hippie kinda dude. He’s got long brown hair, a curly mustache, and thin-framed square glasses. He even converted his mini-van into a hippie van by pulling out all the back seats and installing a bed, some drawers, a wrap around curtain, and a tie-dye print sheet for the ceiling. Lol It was the coolest thing I’ve ever seen! He’s letting me shower, crash on his couch, and cooking me dinner! He was actually gonna thruhike the AT last year, but had to have surgery on his knee a month before his start date. So he still plans to do it eventually and has all the gear for it already. We talked a lot about the trail, and Virginia, and compared gear and stuff. I spent most of the evening hanging out with his pet dog and rooster. Lol
I know this all sounds ludicrous I’m sure, but this is gonna make the trail a lot more interesting. So ya, judge if you will. This hike is about to get real different, but also hella FUN and I’m excited. 
ALSO. The fourth thing I learned today is that Burger King has a veggie burger! SAY WHAT. And it’s only $3 OMG. The Gods of Fast Food have provided and I’m grateful. And now probably addicted. #cheapestveggieburgerever","Buchanan, VA

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601939,"So today was the iconic visit to McAfee Knob! McAfee is one of the top 5 most popular/iconic photo stops for every thruhiker on the AT. It’s basically this overhanging cliff-rock that you can walk out on and get your picture taken overlooking the whole valley and mountain range. It’s a pretty sweet spot. In order to get my candid photo though, I had to make sure I wasn’t the only one up there. So last night, I made plans to leave with Buster and Disco this morning, so that we’d all be up there at the same time. They get up really early though. So I had set an alarm for 6am, but I slept right through it and didn’t wake up until 6:45. And they wanted to be hiking by 7am at the latest. So I was scrambling around and throwing my shit together super fast. In 20mins I was set. Never done that before. Lol
Glad it was a clear day. The views were great at the Knob and I got lots of good photos. Disco is kinda scared of heights, so he was reluctant to pose standing on the edge of the cliff. So instead he sat down and crawled to the edge. After the photo he was like “No way, that was too much. I gotta go calm down. I’m gonna go smoke a bowl.” And then he disappeared into the woods. Lol
Ended up hiking the whole day with them. Buster led us and Disco backed up the rear. And I was in the middle. Apparently I hike fast because by the end of the day Buster was complaining that I had been “pushing” him and Disco was upset by my “lack of effort”. Said I looked like I was barely out of breath all day. Haha! It feels nice to finally be the “fast” one in the group. I should hike with old people more often. 
Today was a short day because we decided to veer half a mile off trail to a donation-based hostel in Catawba, VA called Four Pines Hostel. After resupplying at a gas station down the road, we reached the hostel by 1pm. So I had the entire afternoon to just chill. Four Pines is an interesting place though. I mean you can’t expect much since there’s really no charge to stay there. But still... The “hostel” is a 3-bay garage that’s been outfitted with wooden bunks, a bathroom, and fridge. You can take a shower, but no towels are provided. So you gotta put your dry clothes on your wet body. You can do laundry, but there’s only a washer. No dryer. Needless to say, I didn’t do either. The idea of getting myself and all my clothes WET did not sound appealing. The place is also crawling with cats, which was a disappointing surprise since I’m allergic. Ugh. Overall though, it was a nice place to hang out for the evening, especially since it started storming later. Oh, and they have WiFi. 
Right as we were getting ready for bed, a guy with a pack comes walking through the door soaking wet. After dropping off his gear and asking for our names, he introduces himself as Fresh Grounds... Fresh grounds?! I looked up at Buster and Disco and they were absolutely clueless. This was THE Fresh Grounds. A guy that essentially lives on the AT during hiking season and follows the front of the NoBo bubble from Georgia all the way to Maine with his car. He stops at road crossing and different places everyday, sets up a big tarp tent, and cooks HUGE glorious meals for thruhikers passing by. The whole operation is based off of donations - by hikers, for hikers! He’s a trail legend basically. And his name is Fresh Grounds because he serves hikers fresh ground coffee every morning with breakfast. I had never seen him on trail, but always heard about him. I was always about a week ahead of the bubble that he was following, so we never crossed paths. SO crazy to finally meet the dude though, and in Virginia of all places.","Campbell Shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601940,"Got up early today and left the hostel with the old dudes. We didn’t hike together today, but every time I stopped for an hour break they eventually would catch up. Lol There were two big climbs today. The first was a 2.5 mile hike up to Dragon’s Tooth Rock, which actually ended up being a pretty rocky/scrambley climb. The whole way up I couldn’t help but think “WTF Virginia??”  
The second bump was a slow and steady 3.8. It was after lunch and it was hot. One thing I’ve noticed about VA recently is that water sources are scarce and far in between. So I’ve been forced to carry WAY more water up hills than I would ever want too. 
It’s just the three of us at the shelter/campsite tonight. Buster and Disco are tenting and I decided to throw my tent up in the shelter because it looks like it’s gonna rain. Buster is starting to get on my nerves. He never stops talking, which isn’t the end of the world. But he’s one of those people that has lots of big opinions and shares them unsolicitedly and always has to be right. He keeps trying to push me to talk about politics and “vegan athletes” and all this other BS that we OBVIOUSLY disagree on. I’m all about “respecting your elders” and whatever but sometimes people need to be told to shut the fuck up. No madder their age. 
Super pumped for tomorrow though!! I got off-trail plans with a guy from Virginia Tech! His name is Hector, he’s 23, going to vet school, and VEGAN. So basically my soulmate. Lol He’s picking me up after work and taking me back to Blacksburg, VA for the evening. We’ve been talking for about a week now and pretty much have everything in common, so I think it’s gonna be great. Plus I’ll get a shower, laundry and real food, which never gets old. 
I’ll try and update soon, so that no one thinks I got axe-murdered or something. Lol!","Catawba, VA

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602338,"Woke up in the middle of the night to a bunch of flashing lights. At first I thought it was a group of people coming down the mountain with their headlamps on. But it was actually an electrical storm. No rain or thunder, just tons of lightning lighting up the sky. It was a cool, but creepy thing to wake up to at 3am. 
Slept in until nearly 9am this morning. It was only about a 10 mile hike to the road Hector was picking me up on and he couldn’t be there until 4:30. So I was taking my time all day. Hit the 1,500 mark today! I’m getting there, eventually! Also, met an older lady on trail today going north. Her name was Pathfinder and she claimed to be the last NoBo of the season. And considering it’s Sept 1st, I believe it. 
I got to the road at like 2pm, so instead of waiting around I hitched 8 miles to a gas station where I hung out drinking sweet tea and eating apples and potato chips until Hector picked me up. Hector is a cool dude. He’s this scrawny little 5’5” guy with a thick Salvadorian accent. He’s 23, senior at Virginia Tech, works at Chipotle, and has 3 girls for roommates. Lol He’s one of those very personable, yet extroverted types. He kept talking to me like we’d been friends for years, when really I’m a smelly stranger he met online and just picked up out of the woods. Lol! We talked about tons of stuff like the trail, his giant Salvadorian family, college life, the ethics of zoos, and lots of vegan shit. 
After I showered and did laundry, we drove downtown for dinner. Blacksburg, VA is a small college town, so “downtown” was only several blocks backed up by the giant university. It’s a cool little town though. Like WAY bigger and nicer than any of the trail towns in Virginia. Like the traffic lights actually had crosswalks with little timers that talked to you. It freaked me out at first. 
Hector shocked me when he asked if it was okay if we went and ate at Mellow Mushroom for dinner... Mellow Mushroom?!? I couldn’t believe Blacksburg had a Mellow Mushroom. It’s only like my 2nd favorite place to eat-out at in Austin, TX!! It’s a super hip pizza place that carries vegan cheese that you can put on any pizza you order. I was SO excited. First REAL trail pizza! 
Afterwards, we walked to this small coffee shop that sold a variety of vegan pastries. I stocked up on muffins for tomorrow’s breakfast. Later, we watched a movie called “21” on Netflix about a guy who learns to count cards in Vegas and becomes super rich. Lol I’m staying up way later tonight than I probably should, but it feels really nice and refreshing to do “normal people” things. Haha","Niday Shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602339,"Omg it was so hard to get up this morning. I slept until 9am. Felt like I was sinking deeper and deeper into that Tempur-pedic mattress with every hour that passed. Lol After I finished eating my vegan pineapple muffins, Hector drove me back to the trailhead and I was hiking again by 10:30am. I could have slept all day in that bed, but unfortunately Hector had lunch plans with friends so I had to go. Lol But we agreed to stay pin-pals for the rest of my trip. 
Hanging out with Hector in a cool hip college town eating good vegan food was all a nice break from the daily hiking routine, but also made going back to trail really hard. I didn’t make it very far today. A whole 7 miles. Lol I’m already itching to be in the next town - Pearisburg, VA. Oh, and I’ve come to the realization today that I am terribly fed up with trailmix. Like I officially hate peanuts and raisins. Just the thought of them makes me wanna gag. 
Oh and I did a thing this evening. I busted out The List. You know, that List I made before trail of all the reasons I’m doing the trail, shouldn’t quit the trail, and what I think I’ll gain from it. Ya that one. Lol I don’t feel like I’ve officially cracked per say, but the reminder was over due. I’d share The List here, but it’s not time yet. I will say though that there’s a lot of things I’d hope to get out of this trail that i think I’ve already achieved out here. There’s also some things that still need time and a lot of work. I just gotta stay focused. No matter how long it takes me, I’m finishing this trail. Lol","Blacksburg, VA
",Johns Creek campsite,"Sep 02, Sun",7.40
V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602340,"Today was a desperate day. I did a 3.5 mile hike up this mountain right out of camp and was just done. I wasn’t supposed to reach Pearisburg until tomorrow, but I got there today because this nice couple, Doug and Angie, offered me the ride when I was standing on this desolate dirt road that leads to no where and so I just couldn’t resist. Which means about 20 miles of trail got yellow-blazed today. I know, I know - sue me. I’m dying out here, okay. Lol
They were driving this swagged out, soft top black Jeep with an intense stereo system. We went driving all through the mountains with the windows down and some heavy rap bass bumping through the surround-sound speakers. They drove me by this cabin/resort place where the movie Dirty Dancing was filmed! Lol And then they drove me all the way to Pearisburg and dropped me off at McDonalds where I was super psyched to get a large sweet tea and French fry. There were signs posted everywhere inside the McDonalds asking patrons to “Please Don’t Loiter”. I almost felt like they were speaking specifically to me. Lol
Eventually I left and started the 3 mile road walk to Angel’s Rest Hiker Haven, the hostel I’m staying at tonight. Luckily an older couple, Bob and Jill, saw me walking and gave me a lift. The hostel is pretty sweet. It’s just a cluster of temporary buildings and campers, but the inside of everything is really clean and well kept. Also, the staff is super nice. Tenting is $12 a night and the bunkhouse is $25, so I paid for a tent site because I’m cheap. But whenever I went to set up my tent earlier right before dark, one of the guys that works here (Acadicus) whispers over to me “You should just go sleep in the bunkhouse. There’s AC...”. Well, don’t mind if I do! Lol
It’s just me, Disco, and Buster here tonight. They showed up a couple hours after me this afternoon and were of course shocked to see me. “How in the hell did you get ahead of us??” Lol! I knew I was gonna get grilled. Because of the detour into Blacksburg with Hector, they were supposed to be a day ahead of me still. I confessed my yellow-blazing sins and they laughed. Buster looked at me and was like “Honestly, if I had been given the offer to skip the last 20 miles, I’d have done it too. You didn’t miss a damn thing.” Haha! 
It was nice getting to spend most of the day hanging out at the hostel. I forgot it’s Labor Day though, so the only place open in town is the grocery store. The hostel has a huge “hiker food box” though, full of unwanted food and snacks left behind. I was actually able to do an entire 5 day resupply from their box. So I didn’t have to purchase anything from the grocery store, which was amazing luck. 
The day here went by rather quickly. Disco and Buster are leaving in the morning, but I’m not sure yet what I’ll be doing. It’s always tempting to stay another night. I guess I’ll see how I feel tomorrow.","Johns Creek campsite

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602341,"I woke up this morning and just couldn’t do it. Lol I’m zeroing today. And really glad I did because guess who walked in the door this morning - Riddler!! Riddler is a girl I met on trail in Vermont. She’s a flipflopper like myself, but I hadn’t seen her since Gorham, NH. Literally FOREVER ago!! She’s the first familiar face I’ve seen since flipping south. I’ve never been so happy to run into someone. Lol Running into her is a great surprise, but also proof that I have slowed down IMMENSELY. Like she should have never caught up to me. Haha
We recapped everything that had happened since Gorham, which was A LOT. She also seemed to be stuck in a “Virginia Blues” state of mind, which made me feel better about my attitude lately. Lol We spent the day being super lazy, eating food and watching movies, like “The Wedding Crashers” and “Salt”. It was great. I spent most of the day assuming that we’d be leaving the hostel tomorrow morning and hiking on together, but unfortunately that doesn’t seem to be the case. Riddler found out on trail recently that a close family member was diagnosed with cancer and will be starting treatment on October 6th. She wants to be home by the time treatment starts, so she has a hard deadline to make. And unless she skips ahead about 100 miles of trail, she won’t make it. So that’s what she’s decided to do. It’s either that, or quit the trail entirely and go home now, which would suck even more. So tomorrow morning, Acadicus is gonna shuttle her ahead to a town about 2 hours away. I’m super bummed that our reunion was so fleeting, but I also can’t imagine having to deal with all that on trail and then still have the strength and determination to finish the hike. Like big props to her! And much love.","Pearisburg, VA

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602342,"So last night before bed, I presented Riddler with a proposition. But, before I explain the proposition, it needs some context. So about 2 weeks ago I stopped brushing my hair, like I’m just done. I would usually only brush my hair right after I washed it, but lately I haven’t even been doing that. I just stick it back up in a messy, untamed ponytail. And what has started to happen is my hair has begun to dread itself. Like rope-like dreads and knots are forming all over my head and it’s a mess. I decided to roll with it though because having dreaded hair on trail would be a lot easier to deal with than constantly having to battle the knots and tangles. However, in order for your hair to dread in an “orderly manner”, you have to separate the hair in small sections all over your head and give the knots a place to start, so that your whole head of hair doesn’t become just one giant single knot. I don’t know if any of this is making sense, but the point is that last night I offered to pay for Riddler’s 2hr shuttle (that she was taking to skip that 100 miles of trail) in exchange for staying just a half-a-day more with me at the hostel and helping me section off my hair. 
She took me up on the offer and stayed today and helped me mangle with my hair for nearly 6 hours. Lol it’s a tedious process and I couldn’t have done it by myself, so I appreciated the help. She was also glad to have her shuttle paid for because she was running tight on funds. Today felt like the furtherest day from trail yet. Just two girls playing with hair all day and watching Shrek in the middle of the living room at the hostel. Lol It was great. 
Eventually though, Riddler left around 3pm. We said our goodbyes and stuff, which was kinda sad. She actually asked me to jump ahead with her, and as much as I wanted too, I couldn’t. 100 miles of trail is a lot. That’s like 7-8 days. As much as I want a friend to hike with, I personally wouldn’t be able to live with myself. So, on she went. :(
I spent the rest of the afternoon doing a lot of nothing. Ended up falling asleep for a couple of hours around 5pm, which messed up my whole sleep cycle for the day. Hung out with Acadicus a lot this evening, the guy who works here. He actually thruhiked the AT last year and has another trail-trip planned for early November. He’s gonna go hike through The Ozarks for about a month and a half. In a weird turn of events, we started talking and I think I’ve convinced him to take off 5 days in October and hike The Smokies with me. Lol It was apparently one of his favorite sections and all I’ve been doing since I got to this hostel is complain that I have no one to hike with, so I think empathy was achieved and I might get a hiking buddy for a bit! Haha
There’s still a lot of trail though between here and The Smokies, so I gotta get hiking again. If you stay 3 nights or more at this hostel you get a free patch that says “The Vortex” and the name of the hostel. Lol And guess what, I got the patch! Which means that tomorrow I am getting the hell out of here even if it kills me! I’m sinking like quicksand these days. Every town gets harder and harder to leave. Lol","Pearisburg, VA

Spent the morning catching up on the blog and other social medias. Around 12:30pm, I packed up all my things, put on my hiking clothes/boots, and sat outside on the front porch until I could get someone to shuttle me back to the trailhead. The hostel does shuttles to the trailhead for free and Acadicus is the driver. Acadicus, and his coworker Mule, join me on the front porch. We all talk for about an hour or so, but then we get hungry. So we dip into the kitchen for a bit and snack, and then go back out on the porch and talk for another hour. And before you know it, it’s 3:00 and I’m still NOT hiking. At this point, Acadicus and Mule were making bets on whether or not I’d get roped into staying another night. They kept asking, “Are you sure you wanna go? Because you don’t HAVE too, you know?” Lol Acadicus even told me I could stay for FREE if I chose to stay just one more night. But I’d already stayed 3 nights!! It was SO tempting though. I kept telling them how dangerous of a situation they were creating for me. Lol Like this is exactly how people fall off trail forever. They get wrapped up in some town with some locals, and before you know it they’re in a relationship and offered a job and never see the trail again. Eventually, it hit me though. I looked over at Acadicus and was like “Dude, I gotta get the fuck out of here!” Lol
So he drove me back to the trail, and I was hiking by 3:30. Before we said goodbye though, I made him promise that he’d come hiking with me in The Smokies. And he promised, scouts honor. Lol I did a steep hike out of town up Angel’s Rest mountain with a heavy, freshly loaded pack. Today ended up being a short day, obviously. I stopped at the first shelter I saw, which was about 8 miles in. Tenting in the shelter again since it’s only me here.

I swear to Jesus H Christ I am getting back on trail tomorrow and hiking away from Pearisburg for good. If for some insane reason I don’t, you have every right to call me and ask what the fuck I’m doing. Lol Obviously, me and this Acadicus dude have just really hit it off and I’m riding this wave for as long as it can last. Haha He promises to drive me back to where I left off tomorrow. Says he doesn’t want to “play a part in me not finishing me hike”. LOL! WHAT! I told him not to flatter himself because that’s definitely NOT happening. 
ALSO, guess who caught up to me?? Production! Like one of the only sobo flipfloppers I’ve met in the south. Lol Hadn’t seen him since The Shenandoahs. It was fun catching up with him. He was relieved to see that he wasn’t the only one having a hard time moving through Virginia. We both agreed that Virginia was hella easy, but the mental hike was kicking our asses. Lol He’s staying here tonight and zeroing tomorrow. 
Tonight at dinner is me, Acadicus, Production, Mule, a couple sectioners, Whip, and The Tramp. Whip is an original SoBo here all the way from Maine. He’s a cheesy, funny guy. It seems like the longer I stay here, the more new faces I’m seeing. The Tramp is a really cool dude. There was a Lady, but there in the middle of working out stuff.. Lol. He’s staying here on Work-For-Stay for an unbeknownst amount of time. He’s done most of the trail with his Lady, but they got off recently because she didn’t wanna hike anymore and he’s taking time to decide whether or not to finish it without her. She went home to Florida and he didn’t wanna be that far from the trail, hence the WFS at the hostel. I thought he was super cool for two reasons. One, he bought this van for $2,500, gutted the whole inside, and built/installed a bed, tv, cabinets, fans, batteries, and a pull-out grill. He’s now living out of the van with his two dogs and traveling down the AT. I was in awe. It was so fascinating and gives me so many ideas. Like the amount of freedom he has, just wow! Lol And Two, tonight he cooked all of us dinner! It was a veggie stir fry with rice and chicken. And he told me he cooked the veggies and the chicken separately just for me. :) Lol
You know what’s more annoying than vegans who always talk about being vegan?? People that deliberately go out of their way to start arguments with vegans!! Acadicus went and opened Pandora’s box today and for no good reason. We got in a heated debate about the dairy industry, evolution, animal ethics, blah blah blah the whole shebang! My patience hadn’t been this tested in AWHILE. For a moment, I regretted coming back and wished I wasn’t so far from the trail. I could tell he was almost deliberately pushing my buttons. I was sweating I was so angry. And the whole time, Production sat in the corner of the room, silent and a little scared. Lol Eventually, I dismissed myself and told him I needed to go decompress because everything else I had left to say was just insulting and violent... Shots were fired, but they were all surface wounds, fortunately. After I made Acadicus admit he was an asshole, we made up. So all is well. Lol I’m glad I’ve learned how to hang out with people I disagree with. #Adulting
Tonight all the stoners are hanging out in Acadicus’s camper. I’m just here by association. Lol The Tramp passed me the bong and I just laughed, “I don’t even know how to use this!” Haha Everyone always gets SO surprised when I say I don’t smoke.

Everyone at the hostel kept asking if I was ACTUALLY leaving this time. Most didn’t believe me when I said yes. Lol But it’s true, I have to hike on. It was really hard to get moving though. I slept in and didn’t get back on trail until 11am. Acadicus drove me 40 mins south back to where I had last jumped off. It felt weird parting ways, but I feel like we’ll meet again. Hopefully. 
Even with the late start, I still managed to put in some heavy miles. Feeling pretty refreshed and refocused. Hit that 1,600 mile mark today! Water is getting scarcer and scarcer in southern VA. Like there was only ONE water source in between today’s 20 mile stretch and it was 0.6 off trail down a steep hill! Like WTF. 
It’s supposed to storm all week. It didn’t pour on me today though fortunately. Just really misty and lots of thunder.

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603068,"I had originally planned for today to be a 25 mile day, but that plan soon became overly optimistic. I overslept and didn’t get hiking until 9:30. There were a lot of short, but steep ups today that made it difficult to catch that 3mph speed. So I ran out of time basically. I called it quits around 5pm because I happened to be at a shelter and it was starting to rain. The idea of hiking several more miles just so I could get soaked and have to set up my tent in the rain was less than appealing. Also, tonight’s shelter is pretty dope. It’s a four-walled stone shelter with a door and everything! It’s like a small little cabin and I have it all to myself. Lol
The only downside about this shelter is that it has no water source near it and it’s sitting on the tippy top of a mountain. So I had to pack up a lot of water to camp with for the night and stuff. Usually, that’s not too big of a deal except this guy today named Gary doing his “trail magic” really messed me up! Long story short, he gave me all this false information about the local water sources for the evening and it really screwed me over. Ended up not having enough water for camp and having to hike 5 miles down the trail in the morning to get water for breakfast. Thanks a lot Gary!!! xP
Met a cool, interesting family today. It was a dad (Sweeps) and his two kids, 9 and 10 years old (Bear and Fizzy). Those kids were fucking superhuman. They’re SoBos trying to finish the trail in less than 100 days! The dad looked exhausted. Lol The kids were pushing him hard, averaging 25-35 miles EVERY DAY.

The rest of the day was really drizzly and misty. I actually didn’t see a single person on trail all day! No day hikers or anything. Kinda creepy. 
Got a nice lunch in at Bear Garden hostel. It was just 0.3 miles off trail, so I thought I’d make the trip down the road. And happy I did because they had loads of snacks and sodas for sale. No one was even there though!! So it was all honor-system based, which is kind of a neat thing to see. 
The trail went through a lot of overgrown, farm fields today, which is like my least favorite thing. Especially in the rain because you don’t get any tree cover, so you’re just like soaked. Also, the rain made all the once-dry cow patties wet, so I was just hurdling over cow poop for several miles in the rain praying to god I didn’t skip and fall. Lol
On a different note... I know I complain a lot, but I think I’ll be extremely proud of myself when I finish this. This blog is more than anything just space for me to vent with an audience. Not every day is as miserable as I make it sound sometimes. Lol it’s just that hiking 2,200 miles cross country is a BIG feat and there are many days where the reality of that colossal goal really sets in. Also, I’m one of those people that when the end is in sight, instead of sprinting to the finish line, I come to a near CRAWL. It also doesn’t help that every day hiker I pass keeps telling me “Wow! You have less than 600 miles! You’re almost done!” OMG. That kills me!! No I’m not almost done! That’s just dangerous thinking. Have you ever voluntarily hiked 600 miles?? Probably not. Because that’s really freaking FAR. Lol I’m trying to stay focused and keep up the momentum I left Pearisburg with.

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603072,"Another rainy day. Bleh. 
Actually met a NoBo today named Torch! He seemed about my age and like a cool dude. I was so confused when I saw him though. I figured he was just section hiking, but nope. Said he was hoping to get all the way to New Hampshire this year!! I disagreed, but didn’t have the heart to tell him. Lol What was funny though was that one of the first things he asked me was if I could sell him some weed! Haha! Not only do I look like a stoner apparently, but now a dealer?! Lol What. 
Dipped into Atkins, VA this morning for a “quick” resupply. I hate hitting towns early in the morning because I end up spending way too much time there and then still have a ton of miles to hike for the day. Crazy thing though, I stopped in a local diner for breakfast and saw Undertow there! Undertow is an older guy I met in Maine doing an inverted-type flipflop. Instead of hiking south from Harpers Ferry after Maine like I did, he went all the way down to Georgia and is hiking north to Harpers Ferry. So I knew there was a small chance we’d cross paths at some point, but it was VERY unlikely. So getting to have breakfast this morning with him was a neat surprise. 
After breakfast, I had to hitch a mile further into town to reach the post office and Dollar G. I’ve hitched hundreds of times so far along the trail, trying to get in and out of towns and such. I’ve literally made it over 1,600 miles with ZERO issues, but today was THE day I guess. I had the creepiest hitch EVER. It was this old, grizzly looking guy in his 60s probably. They usually always are, so I wasn’t super concerned with how he looked. But OMG, as he was dropping me off at the post office, he looks over at me and asks, “Do you like to mess around??”... AHH! BLEHHHH!!! I never opened a car door so fast. But my pack was in the back seat! So as I was pulling my gear out of the back, he repeats the question as if I didn’t hear him the first time! BLEHH! I slammed the door and shuffled away. My skin was CRAWLING. I felt like I needed a shower! Gross, gross, gross. I know so many of y’all are probably thinking “ Omg you need to be more careful you could have died blah blah blah.” Lol I know, I know. Considering how far I had made it with no issues, I kinda let my guard down. BUT I do always have a pocket knife on the waistband of my shorts whenever I’m hitching and there’s not a doubt in my mind that if he had laid a hand on me I would have gutted his esophagus right out of his throat without hesitation. Lol Guaranteed. 
On a lighter note, I talked to my Dad today. Our conversation though just kinda stirred up a lot of anxiety about after-trail life. Like the idea of going back to Texas and doing virtually anything there just makes me wanna cry. I feel like when I across that Georgia state line and realize I only have 78 miles left, I’m gonna have the meltdown of a lifetime. The truth is I don’t want to get off trail. If I was so miserable I would have quit a long time ago. My worst day out here is still better than my best day in Texas. At least a hard day on trail teaches me shit and makes me a stronger person. A hard day at Jamba Juice in Austin, TX resulted in a lot of piety stress and anxiety that gained me nothing in life. Lol I have no idea how I’m gonna walk away from this trail. The best solution I have at the moment is that I NEED to get a trail job. Like working at a hostel, national park, ridge-running, something! It’s a really different, yet really simple kind of life out here and I’d do anything to make it last as long as possible.","Davis Hollow campsite

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603073,"Today was actually a really sunny, nice day. It’s honestly amazing what one dry day in the midst of a rainy week can do for your soul. Lol Every day hiker I run into though keeps reminding me of the hurricane coming. I personally think everyone just needs to calm their tits. Like the storm is serious and lots of people will be affected I know, but fortunately where I am I’m really not gonna be in the heat of it. At all. And I plan to reach Damascus by Sunday evening, so that helps. 
On a different note, I’m kinda starting to understand why people rehike parts of the AT. When I was up north, I ran into several people who had already thruhiked the whole trail and were now coming back to rehike long portions of it, like Potato and Handy. At the time, I found it mind boggling. You hiked 2,191 miles and now your back to do some of it again?? Like wtf. But now, I think I get it. When you’re in the middle of thruhiking, you constantly have to stay focused on the overall goal, which involves waking up everyday and hiking forward. And it’s a LONG goal, taking an unbelievable amount of determination and consistency. So much focus that sometimes it’s hard to enjoy a lot of it. BUT once you’ve completed the whole thing, the pressure to rack up the miles everyday is gone. You can spend as much time as you want at any view, campsite, shelter, etc. This is part of the reason why it’s nearly impossible for me to spend time in town and not constantly feel guilty about it simply because I know that there are miles that need to be hiked and I gotta keep moving. 
So that being said, I’d love to finally finish the trail, but then just stay on the trail forever. Lol Trail life is such a simple life. And don’t tell me I can’t live on trail because I’ve met a lot of people doing just that and it’s pretty rad. Who knows what the hell I’m gonna do when this is finished, but right now I feel like the closer I am to the AT the better.","Stealth camping

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603075,"I didn’t sleep well at all last night. At 3am I was awoken to the sound of a large animal screaming it’s lungs out. It must have been a deer, and maybe an injured deer, but honestly I have no idea what it was. It was just SO loud, really creepy sounding! It started hollering from a distance and was moving closer and closer to the direction of my tent and then all of a sudden it just stopped. Absolutely terrifying. Lol
Most of the morning was misty and foggy. Hit that 1,700 mile today! Finally getting productive again, thank god! Lol The trail today was kinda weird. Recently they’ve had a lot of “aggressive bear” activity around Grayson Highland State Park, so park officials actually closed three shelters around the park and banned ALL camping for a 17 mile stretch of the trail. So what that meant was that you had to get through that piece of the trail within one day and camp outside of the boundary. Not a super big deal because it was only 17 miles, and I can do that in one day. But then as I was hiking through this stretch, I reach another sign that says the AT has been rerouted to go around the park ENTIRELY because of Hurricane Florence and “overhead hazards”. What? So instead they were encouraging people to take the Pine Mountain Trail, which actually reduced a 10-mile stretch of the AT down to 2 miles! So basically there was this sign post by officials educating me about a shortcut and encouraging me to take it. So fuck ya, I took it. Lol Saved me a lot of time, which allowed me to hike way further than I had originally planned for today. I didn’t think I’d reach Damascus until Sunday, but now I should get there by tomorrow. So that’s cool! Any AT hiker reading this is probably screaming blasphemy because I “skipped” the ponies. Everyone calm down, I still got to see the wild ponies while on the side trail. It was hella foggy and rainy, but I got the pictures to prove it!","Fox Creek campsite

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603076,"Another rough night of sleep. I slept in the shelter last night and apparently it’s located right underneath this SUPER tall oak tree. And all night, like every 5-10 minutes, an acorn would fall and smack the top of the tin roof and it was literally one of the loudest sounds I’ve ever heard in the woods. Like it sounded like a giant rock was hitting a glass windshield, and it just kept happening again and again! Fortunately, I have earplugs on me, but even then it was still insanely loud. Lol
Even with the restless night though, I was moving this morning. Today was town day! I knocked out those 15 miles and reached Damascus, VA around 1pm. This is the LAST trail town of Virginia!! Like holy fuck thank god. And Damascus is a cool place to be. It’s the most hiker-friendly town on the AT and home of the annual “Trail Days Festival” that happens every year in May. I obviously didn’t get to experience the festival this year, but I plan to come back next year and attend. It’s a MUST for any thruhiker. It’s a 3-day festival filled with thousands and thousands of AT hikers camped all over the town. There’s gear reps and vendors posted up along all the streets and parades and shows and everything. Just one big hiker trash party. Sounds amazing! Lol
The trail takes you directly through the town. One of the first restaurants you pass is MoJo’s “the trailside cafe.” So I stopped in and got a super yummy portobello mushroom burger. Then I made my way through town over to Woodchuck Hostel. Woodchuck is an older guy who thruhiked the trail in 2012 and then opened his own hostel here in 2014. The DREAM. And get this, ITS FOR SALE! Ugh, what a life. Running one of THE most popular hostels on trail in THE most popular trail town. I picked his brain on a lot of things and just wow. The whole idea is SO tempting. 
Whenever I first walked into the hostel though, I was really confused. I was greeted by Woodchuck and a handful of other dudes who all seemed really surprised to see me. They asked if I had just come off trail, to which I replied yes. Like what, duh? And then they told me that I wasn’t supposed to have been out there because, get this, THE TRAIL HAS BEEN CLOSED FOR DAYS! LOL! The ATC literally declared the trail “closed” for the whole state of Virginia and North Carolina and park officials were apparently issuing up to $5,000 fines. Hahaha! What! I’ve been out in the woods for days how the fuck was I supposed to know that! Lol Also, wtf you can’t just close the AT. The storm isn’t even coming here!! Probably the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard. Lol 
ALSO, I caught up to Buddy and Disco! They’re here at the hostel tonight! I spent an extra 4 nights in Pearisburg over them and it only took me like a week to catch them again. Lol Disco seemed really happy to see me. Apparently, Buddy has been driving him insane. Haha! Tonight, I went out for a night on the town with them. We ate a really good dinner at The Mill and then hung out at a bar inside this pizza joint. Lol We’re all zeroing here tomorrow together, so that’s cool. The “bad weather” keeps getting pushed back more and more. It was supposed to be Friday, but now they’re saying Sunday. So whatever, lazy Sunday for me regardless!

The locals and everyone kept saying that all hell was gonna break loose today and literally nothing ever happened.

Breakfast is included with your stay at Woodchuck’s, so I got fruit, potatoes, and Reese’s Puff cereal with Almond milk this morning! Score. Then I almost immediately laid back down for a 2hr nap afterwards. Lol Just spent the day chilling at the hostel with Buddy, Disco, and a weird random assortment of other people who are kinda hikers but also kinda just living here for extended periods of time it seems.. Not entirely sure. Lol 
Met another flipflopper named Flash! He came into the hostel earlier this afternoon. And Flash is an appropriate name because, get this, he started on June 14th nearly an entire month after I started and he’s now caught up to me. So he’s fast. Lol
We all got to talking about Tennessee, mainly because the state line is just a couple miles away! Like I will literally be in TN tomorrow baby!! AHH! But ya, apparently TN hates hikers. Lol Like many years ago a lot of people’s land got seized under eminent domain for the AT and a lot of the locals are still really salty about it. Like back in the day, if you tried to hitch from the trail into Roan Mountain, TN, people would throw trash and bottles at you from their car windows. There were even reports of physical harassment and people stringing fishing line across the trail with fish hooks on it! Like some really crazy shit. This stuff doesn’t really happen anymore, but I assume it’ll probably be a little bit more difficult to get a ride in and out of town there. Lol","Damascus, VA

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603293,"Ate another good breakfast at Woodchuck’s Hostel this morning and then packed up my stuff and headed out to the trail around 9am. It was raining when I left the hostel and it pretty much rained all day. Leaving a warm hostel in clean clothes just to go hike 18 miles through the rain is a hard thing to do, but I did it. Lol Caught up to Buddy and Disco by noon, even though they started hiking at 7:30am. I was moving fast today. Got to the shelter by 3pm! I was tempted to go another 8 miles to the next shelter, but the book says the water source for that shelter was 0.3 miles down hill and we all know I’m not about that life. Lol So I stayed put. I’m glad I beat Buddy and Disco here though because I was soaked and needed time to air dry. Haha. And OH YA, crossed the state line into Tennessee today! FINALLY. Goodbye Virginia - you were chill but I won’t miss you. 
This morning while I was eating breakfast with everybody, Flash and I started talking about the Pacific Crest Trail. The PCT is that other really big cross-country trail that spans the west coast. It starts in Southern California and then goes all the way to Northern Washington. It’s around 2,600 miles long I think, so like a month longer than the AT. When I was headed north, I’d hear NoBos talk about the PCT sometimes. Either saying they’d already done it or that they wanted to do it. I always avoided those conversations like the plague because at the time the idea of another thruhike sounded like absolute torture. Yet, now here I am trying to come up with a hundred different ideas to keep me on trail. So I asked Flash a ton of questions because he thruhiked the PCT in 2016. The AT is apparently a lot more rigorously challenging than the PCT, but the PCT has its own set of demons, like 20-30 mile water carries, 20-50 mile hitches, longer resupply stretches, no tree cover, no shelters, really cold nights and really hot days, etc. So a little more logistically challenging in some areas. But damn, I’m HIGHLY considering it. PCT April 1st 2019!! Here I come! Maybe.. Lol","Damascus, VA

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603332,"Rainy, foggy morning. Started my day by putting my very wet and very cold hiking clothes on my body from the previous day and cringed through the whole process. I actually woke up and started hiking before Buddy and Disco did, which is insane because they’re usually up and out by 6:30am. But with the rain and fog and the fact that the sun doesn’t rise until 7am these days, you really couldn’t see shit until about 8am. Lol I planned for today to be a heavy mile day, so I was a little more motivated to get moving then they were. I wanted to reach Hampton today, and they don’t plan to get there until tomorrow. I wasn’t really thinking about it this morning, but unless I take another zero day or two soon I’ll likely never see them again. Which is a weird and kinda sad thought. I left saying “see you later”, but that actually might not happen. 
The sun came out later in the afternoon and actually turned into a nice day. The trail had a lot of overgrowth on it and tree blow downs. There’s these godforsaken knee-high, stinging nettle weed-type plants that hang over the trail sometimes and it’s nearly impossible to not touch them. I grazed up against about a dozen or so throughout the day, so now my legs are covered in tiny welts and itch like hell. This actually has happened a bunch while hiking through the south, but why I’m just now complaining about it I don’t know. Lol
I tried to keep a 3mph pace all day, so that I could reach town with time to spare. And I did it, but now my feet hurt like hell. Lol I hitched into town and got dropped at Subway, which was all I could think about all day. While I was eating my dinner at a table outside, a woman passed me and then turned around and asked if I was hiking the AT. I told her I was, and then she immediately sat down across from me and opened with “Oh my god, you’re my hero.” Haha! Her name was Debra and she was in her like mid 50s. She proceeded to tell me her whole life story and her dream of hiking the AT. She’s had some health setbacks that have prevented her from doing it, but she seemed to be fascinated with my journey and was super encouraging which was nice. 
Tonight I’m staying at a donation-based hostel in town owned and operated by the legendary Bob Peoples. Bob is 73 yrs old, retired Air Force, and the most involved/popular trail maintainer along the whole AT. He’s won an award almost every year for the past ten years for his work on the trail. I stayed up talking to him until nearly 11pm. Just a wealth of knowledge and information. The amount of work that goes into building and maintaining the AT is absolutely unfathomable. So many organizations at the local, state, and federal level are involved. Doing the work he does (all volunteer based) takes an incredible amount of labor and patience to which I have the utmost respect. Also, this guy has hiked tons of trails literally all over the world. He told me he makes a point to hike one trail a year. Right when he’s finished with one, he starts planning the next. Says it’s the only way to keep his sanity. Lol What a life. 
Bob was really trying to convince me to do the Camino de Santiago trail in Spain next summer over the PCT. The Camino trail is a historical network of spiritual pilgrimages that lead to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela where supposedly the apostle Saint James the Great was buried. It’s a completely different kind of hike when compared to the AT. You don’t carry a tent or stove because everyday you hike from hostel to hostel, and they provide you with dinner. Instead of tracking the mileage you do everyday like on the AT, on The Camino you’re hiking from cathedral to cathedral, whether that be 7 miles or 30 miles. It’s a trail with deep, historical roots and traversed by hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world every year. Just a completely different hike. Bob has done it, obviously. And he was pretty convincing, but I don’t think it’ll be my next hike. It sounds really cool, but in all honesty I don’t think I’d appreciate it very much at the age of 23. I don’t really care for history and never have. Why? Because I’m really young and still think the whole world revolves around myself. Lol So I might have to save that for later in life. 
I don’t know what it is with donation-based hostels and cats, but Bob has 8 of them and they all live in the bunk room. Lol Luckily Bob is a super great guy, so when I mentioned I was allergic, he moved me to this separate little, secluded cabin house that I could have all to myself. This is gonna make me sound pretentious as fuck, but the cabin was covered with dust and spider webs as if it hadn’t been used all year. Like I could leave a handprint in the grime on the bed sheets. So I set up my entire tent in the middle of the room and am sleeping inside it. Lol I know I’ve been living in the woods for months, but I swear the woods is 9 times out of 10 WAY more sanitary then most of the towns and hostels I pass through. So, in the tent I stay. 
Side Note: Amongst all the clutter this hostel has, I found a poem framed and hung on the wall that almost perfectly incapsulates all my bipolar feelings and emotions throughout this trail. At first, I hardly noticed it. From a far, it looked like the Lord’s Prayer incased in this dingy, lacy bordered frame. Like something your grandmother would have hanging in her guest bathroom. But it’s truly a perfect gem of words. So great, I’m sharing it below... 
“After a while, you learn the subtle difference between holding a hand and chaining a soul. 
And you learn, that love doesn’t mean leaning and company doesn’t mean security.
And you begin, to learn that kisses aren’t contracts and presents aren’t promises. 
And you begin, to accept your defeats with your head up and your eyes open, with the grace of an adult not the grief of a child. 
And you learn, to build all your roads on today because tomorrow’s ground is too uncertain for plans. 
After a while, you learn that even sunshine burns if you get too much. So plant your own garden and decorate your own soul, instead of waiting for someone to bring you flowers. 
And you learn, that you really can endure, that you really are strong, and you really do have worth.”","Double Springs shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603333,"This morning I said goodbye to Bob and headed out around 9am. Before I left though, we talked more about trail life and what it means to accomplish something like a thruhike of the AT. We both agreed that the AT is a special place for many reasons, but mainly because it connects a wide variety of people that otherwise would never associate with one another elsewhere. It also allows you to be a 100% authentic version of yourself. When you’re on trail, you’re vulnerable, but no one knows the off-trail version of you so no one judges you for being YOU. No pressures, no bullshit. It’s a great feeling. 
Today was a nice, dry, partly cloudy day. Passed a tree today in which someone had made and hung a wooden sign that read “Springer Mt. 406 Miles.” Holy Fuck. That’s just insane. It might as well of read “In 406 miles, you will experience the most rewarding, yet saddest day of your entire life.” Lol Ended up spending most of the day in deep thought.

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603399,"Well, I officially have an end date (or “summit day”) for my hike: Oct 26th. 
Nothing really went as planned today, but not in a bad way, if anything for the better! Started my day with a 6 mile hike down trail into Roan Mt, TN. I got into town around 10:30am. The road leading into town was like a busy highway, so I stood there for awhile waiting to get picked up but cars were going really fast. Eventually, this old guy going the opposite direction (red flag) stops on the other side of the highway and hollers at me. I couldn’t hear what he asked saying, so I ran across the road. He was trying to tell me that he’d give me a ride into town if I bought him a gas. So I’m thinking, it’s like a 3 mile drive. How much gas are we talking?? He said 2-3 dollars, so I was like fine - whatever. But then I get in the car with him and he starts yapping about being a broke, disabled vet and then says 4-5$ in gas would be nice. And then he asks me if I know my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. And I’m like ya, I’ve heard of the guy. To which he responds, “You know what the Bible says about tattoos? Your body is supposed to be God’s temple and should be treated as such.” I just about opened the car door and took a mouth full of pavement because that would have been less painful than listening to this guy talk. All I wanted was a quick an easy 3 mile ride into town, but I got suckered by this guy for my money AND preached to the whole way there. I put $5 of gas in his car and then had him drop me at the post office. He told me that he’d give me a ride out of town later if he saw me walking along the road. I told him no thanks. Lol Apparently, this guy has a reputation for leaching off of hikers all summer long. He drives back and forth on the highway near the trailhead, waiting for hikers to pop out of the woods. Then, he hits them up for money during the ride. It’s a whole freaking system and I got GOT. Damn it.. Lol
Eventually, I walked down the street to the nearest restaurant for an early lunch. It’s a Mexican food place and I convinced them to make me veggie fajitas without the cheese. Yay. While I was eating, I called my dad to try and work out the logistics for the end of my hike. My dad bought a super fancy RV not too long ago, and so it’s kinda always been planned that he’d road trip up to Georgia from Texas and pick me up at the Southern Terminus. However, because of a family reunion and other things happening mid-October, he either has to pick me up on Oct 14th or Oct 26th. And lately, it kinda looked like I’d be finishing on the 18th. Lol So I had to decide if I was gonna speed up or slow down, and well I decided to slowwwww down. So, Oct 26th it is! It feels really crazy having an end date for all this now. But with the extra time, I’ll really be in no rush to the finish line. I did the math and I can either take like an extra 10 zero days or keep an 11 mile a day average. So all that aggressive momentum I’ve been riding on for the past week just went straight out the window. Lol 
Nothing bad about having more time, but it’ll likely mean I’ll be spending more money. Lol Most people get more frugal towards then end of their hike and lately I’ve been doing quite the opposite. I’m not really at risk of running out of funds or anything though, so I guess it is what it is. But I’d like to take this time to tell people that even though I have lived a very privileged life, I worked two jobs really hard for a little over a year so that I could save up enough funds to do something like this. At the time I didn’t really know it’d be the AT, but I knew it’d be big and expensive. So yes, I paid for all my gear and have been living off my personal savings this entire trip. I take a lot of pride in financial independence and the fact that I can willingly support myself without a job for half a year is a big deal to me. There’s not many things in my life that I can say I earned and completed all on my own. College education is definitely not one, but this is and I think that’s pretty rad. 
So the original plan after eating lunch in town was to head back to the trail, but after the phone conversation with my dad and setting the finish date I wasn’t in much of a hurry. While leaving the restaurant, I was spotted by this guy named David who owns The Station hostel in town. We started chatting and well, before I knew it I was headed back to the hostel for the day. I cant say I needed much convincing. I was an easy sell and his timing was opportunistic. Lol
I could tell though why he was out and about hunting for hikers because when I got there I was his only guest. It’s definitely slow season for hostels in the south right now. The Station is pretty cool though. It’s barely a year old. It’s motto is “built by hikers for hikers.” Lol And it really was. David got a lot of NoBos involved in the construction process last year, having them do work-for-stays and such. It’s a two-story building. The bottom floor is a bar/brewery and music hall, which is pretty sweet. And the top floor is the bunkhouse with a kitchen and lots of bunks. There’s sharpies on the coffee table when you walk in, so you can graffiti the walls and beams on the bed. There’s even donated bottles of Bath & Body Works lotions and perfumes in the women’s restroom. I feel like such a lady right now. Lol With the open bar downstairs, I can only imagine what this place is like when the NoBo bubble comes through. The top two things that bring hikers into town is food and beer and David has it all.
There’s two other “hikers” staying here tonight, but they’re not really paying guests. Older guy named Crazy Wolf was hiking the AT last year, but then he stopped at this place during his trip and soon became a paid employee. So he stayed and has been living that trail life ever since. He drove me to a BBQ place in town that serves the “Impossible Burger”, which is this super legit veggie burger patty that’s pretty new on the market and super good. So I was excited. Crazy Wolf was a crazy, interesting dude. He used to work for the government doing espionage work as a bar tender in South America. Then, he worked in the medical field doing trauma care. Then, he became a super involved anti-nuclear activist doing hunger strikes outside the Whitehouse and occasionally under investigation by the FBI. And now, he just works at a hostel on the AT. This guy could just be full of shit, but listening to him talk was cool nonetheless. Lol
The other guy here is named Poncho. He’s 37 and has been staying here a couple nights doing WFS. Poncho is an interesting one. He’s one of those people who decides they’re gonna go hike on the AT and then just walks out their front door onto the trail with zero knowledge of what they’re doing, where they’re going, or what they’ll need. On day one he was hiking in blue jeans and cowboy boots, carrying two trash bags full of stuff down the trail. Lol He’s doing what’s called a slingshot. He started in Hampton, TN at mile 420 (I know, classy). Then he hiked south to Springer Mt in Georgia, turned around, hiked back up to Roan Mt, and plans to keep going north all the way to Katadhin. Ya, crazy. And he lives on trail, obviously. Lol People out here are the best entertainment.","Elk River campsite

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603557,"Sooo Poncho ended up being a weird dude. And I don’t just mean a little trail crazy. Like this dude hiked with a machete and hunted rattle snakes and copper heads. As the night went on, he got stranger and stranger. And he kinda seemed a little too interested in me to the point where this morning I just woke up and had to leave. I knew I wasn’t hiking today, but I was definitely done staying there. He was just simply insane. Lol
After running errands around town, I eventually made my way over to the Mountain Harbor B&B/Hostel. I knew Buddy and Disco had a reservation there for tonight, and I wanted to sync up. We got there at just about the same time. They’re staying in little private rooms in the bunkhouse. I’m ballin on a budget, so I paid for a tent spot by the river. I spent the majority of the day hanging out with them while watching bad cable TV. The hostel has a little common area with a TV, but they only get like 5 channels. So we ate our instant Ramen hiker dinners and watched about a dozen Jerry Springer reruns. By the end of the evening, I felt like my IQ has dropped about 20 points. Nevertheless, we were all making high bets on whether or not Seth Wheeler was the father of baby Mercedes. Lol
It just kinda dawned on me that eventually I’m gonna have to split ways with the guys soon. If I continue to keep pace with them I’ll finish by Oct 18th or sooner. So I’m gonna have to drop back at some point. And considering I’ve been hiking around them for the majority of the southern half of the trail, it’s kind of a weird feeling. 
I’ve been keeping in touch with Kidska, the girl flipflopper I hiked with for awhile in Maine. She’s still about 10 days behind me, but with my new schedule it’s possible that we might finish together and get to be summit buddies for a 2nd time! That would be truly serendipitous. Lol","Roan Mt, TN

And the guidebook gone and fucked up bad. It said the hike up Hump Mt was only 3 miles, but it was actually 5.5!! When you think you’ve reached the top, but then realize you’re only halfway... it’s a real buzzkill!!
Hump Mt was pretty cool though. It had a bald knob on top for like a mile! There was actually several miles of exposed trail today. No trees, just elbow high grasslands. You got a 360 view of all the surrounding mountains and valleys. Made me kind of reminiscent of New Hampshire. Super glad today had nice weather. It was supposed to rain, but it never came - at least not on my side of the mountain. It would have been a nightmare hiking today’s trail in a thunderstorm. #BeenThereDoneThat
Today I had lunch at an old red barn that trail maintainers have converted into a shelter. Mr Bob Peoples told me that the barn is gonna have to be torn down soon because it’s leaning a lot and will become a safety hazard. So with its demise on the horizon, I did the 0.3 mile trek downhill to check it out. It’s was a shelter with a view, which is pretty rare! And like a lot of people were hanging out there. There was actually like tons of people everywhere on trail today. I guess the Roan Mt area is a hotspot on the weekends. The AT also had a lot of junctions today with other trails and some roads, so that doesn’t help. But it was pretty overwhelming. Like to go from barely seeing one person a day to dozens and dozens of Boy Scouts, weekend warriors, sectioners, lots of people in blue jeans... it was kinda insane. Like I actually had to meander way off into the woods to go the bathroom instead of peeing right next to the trail. Lol
Tonight’s shelter is pretty dope. It’s a fully enclosed, two-story cabin type shelter. And it happens to be the highest shelter (in elevation) on the whole AT, sitting up at 6,186 ft. I’ve only seen like 4-5 of these cabin-type shelters on the trail, but once again I have it all to myself! There’s actually a Boy Scout group here tonight, but they were polite enough to set up all their tents and not hog the shelter. One of the dads/troop leaders seemed to be absolutely fascinated with my hike, so I got to play “thruhiker celebrity” for the evening and answer all their questions. Where do you get food?

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603559,"Dropped down into the low 50s last night. Super glad I got my leggings and puffy mailed back to me because it was COLD. The cool weather made it extra hard to emerge from my sleeping bag this morning. The Boy Scouts were only out for a one night trip, so they had a ton of extra food with them. A kid offered me some cinnamon and raisin bagels and said whatever I don’t eat he has to carry out back to the car. So I ate 3! Lol
While hiking today, I met an older couple named Toni and Jim just out for the day. They were probably in their early 70s. The woman, Toni, was super great. She asked me just under a hundred questions and apologized after each one for holding me up. She kept telling me that I’d remember this trek for the rest of my life and reminded me to be proud of myself. She asked me what my plans were for after the trail, and I told her I wasn’t really sure and didn’t really care. She thought that was fantastic. Lol She said most young thruhikers she meets kinda seem to be “winging it” with life, but to her it made sense - why worry if you don’t have too. Not that I need any kind of validation or justification from old lady strangers on how I’m living my life, but wow it’s sure nice. 
I’ve had a lot of older people recently say things to me along the lines of “It’s good you’re getting this out of your system now” or “You’re in your 20s, so I guess you can get away with fucking off for a bit” etc.. And honestly, this kind of pisses me off. Like this isn’t me just “fucking around”. This is me living my BEST life. To me, this is what living really is. You know, that artificial thing where we subject ourselves to concrete prisons and slave away our youth so that maybe one day we can cling to some false sense of financial security we’ve built for ourselves and spend our “retired” years convinced that we’ve accomplished something simply by going through all the motions, kissing all the ass, and meeting other people’s expectations - ya, like what?? Fuck that. That’s NOT a life. If I was gonna spend my 20s “fucking around”, I would have dropped out of college, moved back home, have no aspirations, and just become another leach on society. But instead, I’m out here everyday mentally, emotionally, and physically taking care of my shit. I’m learning, processing, building... I don’t think I’ll look back 20-30 years from now and be like “damn, I should have worked more. I should have lived a more domestic life and tried to live up to more people’s expectations.” Lol.. I could rant forever. 
I thought I’d run into Buddy and Disco by lunch time, but after talking to some section hikers it looks like they were pushing hard today. I’m staying at a shelter tonight and they went 3 miles further to a campsite, or that’s at least where I assume they went. They had originally planned to reach town Tuesday morning, but I think they’re trying to get there by tomorrow now. I wanted to catch up with them mainly just to say goodbye. With this extra 8-10 days I have to blow, I can’t keep hiking around them otherwise I’ll finish too soon. If I push for Erwin, TN tomorrow hopefully I’ll run into them in town somewhere. I’ll be pretty bummed if I miss them though. It’s crazy how quickly and easily you get separated from people on trail. I feel like it’s gonna be hard to stay in high spirits once we part ways. I like hiking by myself, but they’ve been my camping buddies on and off for awhile now and having people to end your day with is nice. Therefore, having an entire month left of solitude in the woods will probably get to me. *Sigh*","Roan High Knob Shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603561,"With town in reach, I actually got up today before sunrise and was hiking by 7:30am. I know, crazy. The day started super foggy and misty, but eventually cleared up. At one point, the trail went through an old spruce forest on top of this mountain. It was full of huge, old pine trees covered in green moss and had a very “open” feeling to it. Looked like something straight out of Lord of the Rings. Really cool. 
I got to town by an impressive time of 1:30pm. I was hoofing it all day and now my feet are really feeling it. Lol I’m not really “in town”, but I’m staying at Uncle Johnny’s Hostel which is literally right next to the trail and they shuttle hikers into town for free. And Buddy and Disco happen to be staying here as well, so it’s a party! One. Last. Party. *Tear*
Uncle Johnny’s Hostel is trail famous and has been around for decades. Unfortunately, Uncle Johnny died last year, so his wife and son run it now. Right when I walked up onto the porch, the son, Gary, tried to pass me his bottle of Bourbon. Everyone working at the hostel was absolutely hammered. Lol! Trail hostels can be the strangest places sometimes and this is definitely one of those places. 
Spent the afternoon/evening chillin with the dudes. Disco was trying to convince me to choose Oct 14th for my end date. The idea was tempting, but unfortunately it’s too late. That ship has sailed. We all went out to dinner at this Italian restaurant in town. I was really craving spaghetti, so it was a good day. Wolly World was just across the street, so we did a quick resupply and got shuttled back to the hostel. The dudes are hiking on in the morning, so tonight I gotta decide if I’m gonna split ways with them now or later. I was thinking about keeping up with them at least until the next town, Hot Springs, NC, but prolonging the inevitable is just gonna leave me with more and more zero days that’ll have to get eaten up before the end. Zeroing here tomorrow just means a day of absolute boredom though because we’re the only hikers here at the moment. Oh well, what to do.","Cherry Gap Shelter

They’re literally the only thruhikers going south right now that I’ve consistently ran into. Once again, its about to get lonely AF out here. 
I spent the whole day doing a lot of nothing. I’m the only hiker staying here and the employees are all really weird, so I just kept to myself. I ended up traversing down a dangerously deep “rabbit hole” for several hours on YouTube, watching dozens of videos about the Illuminati, the future of AI, evidence of simulated realities, the Mandela Effect, time travel, oh and aliens of course. By nightfall, I was contemplating my entire existence and completely convinced that my whole life is predated and freewill is a hoax.

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603787,"Drizzly morning. Once again leaving a hostel to hike through the cold rain. Bleh. Lol The rain showers picked up a lot later in the afternoon. I feel like it rains all the time now. It was literally all ups today. 10 out of the 16.8 miles I did were steep, long, uphill hikes. My but is sore. I didn’t stop for a lunch break because sitting and eating in the rain sounded really unappealing. So I powered out the miles and reached the shelter by 3:30pm. I would have kept going, but I’m wet and cold and don’t wanna set up my tent in the rain. Getting to the shelter this early is kind of a bummer though. I should have slept in more this morning or something because now I have several hours of nothing to do. I think tomorrow is supposed to be equally as rainy. Yay. 
I’ve become quite the shelter rat lately. Since I’ve been spoiled by almost always having the shelters to myself, they’ve really started to grow on me. Especially on rainy days. I’ve even begun to conquer my fear of just sleeping in my sleeping bag without the comfort of my tent’s bug net. I looked like an idiot always setting up my tent inside the shelters. Lol 
There’s actually another hiker here with me this evening. He showed up kinda late. Clean Sweeps is his name. Older dude. He started as a flipflopper last year, but ran out of time to finish it all in one year. So he’s back now, headed south all the way to Springer Mt. He’s technically a LASHer now (Long Ass Section Hiker), but I thought best not to correct him. Lol This shelter has bear cables for you to hang your food bags from instead of having to mess with the whole rock-and-rope business. Out of the whole daily routine, throwing my bear bag is my least favorite chore. I hadn’t seen bear cables since Maine though, so I forgot how they worked. Clean Sweeps had never seen them, so together we were pretty helpless. But after about 15 mins of staring up at the sky while cold rain pelted my eyeballs, I figured it out. Lol","Erwin, TN

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603788,"Today was honestly pretty miserable. It started with me putting my very wet and very cold hiking clothes back on my body at 7:30am. This process is always just as painful as the last. The only upside is that it gets me moving really quickly in the morning. I left the shelter by 8am, before Clean Sweeps. The whole day was really windy and really rainy. It was cold enough to where I actually had to hike with my rain jacket on, which is something I haven’t done since Maine. I’m really ready for a dry and sunny day at this point. 
This evening I’m staying at another shelter and for the second day in a row there is actually someone else here. Crazy. Lol Older section hiker named Jiffy Pop headed north. This guy is annoying AF though. I showed up to the shelter around 4:30pm after hiking 19 miles in the rain and this guy hiked 6 miles up the other side of the mountain where it did NOT rain and is complaining about his socks being wet. He looked at me and had the audacity to ask if it had rained for me today. My hair is literally dripping... I don’t know what this guy’s deal was, but the moment I said I was thruhiking the AT he got really defensive about his “section hike status”. At no point was I acting like my hike was somehow better than his. Like we’re all doing the same damn trail people. It doesn’t matter how we’re doing it as long as we’re getting it done, right? But it was like everything I talked about this guy kept trying to one-up me. Like how he’s hiked The Presidential’s in New Hampshire twice, and hiked Mt Katadhin in Maine up and down every way possible, and has done all the other mountains in Baxter State Park, etc etc ETC! I wasn’t sure if we were gonna have to pull out our dicks and measure up or what, but it literally never ended. And then when I thought this guy couldn’t get anymore ridiculous, he pulls out a gigantic 15 L bear-proof food CANISTER that weighs a whopping 3 lbs when EMPTY! LOL WHAT! I didn’t really mean to laugh right in this guy’s face, but it happened. With all the hiking and backpacking experience this guy claimed to have, I’ve never seen anyone carry a giant, heavy container to keep their food in. Like just put that shit in a tree?? It made zero sense. And to top it off, he also pulled out this big, metal aerosol can of “bear spray”! He said the other day he saw a bear cub and was standing by with his hand on the bear spray waiting for mama bear to show up.. Lol!! This guy was straight up trigger-happy on the bear mace.

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603851,"Today felt like a pretty quick day. The rain finally stopped, but the trail was still a mess. I saw in the guidebook that there was a small hostel just off a dirt road about a mile from the trail, so I was cruising today trying to get there at a decent time. I did 17 miles by 2pm! 
Hemlock Hollow Hostel is a pretty chill place. There’s a bunch of little bunkhouse cabins along a creek and they all have a TV and DVD player. And guess who I ran into here?? Disco!! Lol I really thought I wouldn’t see him again. Apparently him and Buddy had a falling out, so he dropped back and let Buddy press ahead. Buddy is an extremely difficult, stubborn, self-centered person. He makes all his plans around himself and dominates every conversation. I’m honestly surprised that Disco stuck with him for as long as he did. And as if the trail drama wasn’t hot enough, Disco said Buddy was talking some mad shit about me behind my back. I tried to get him to tell me what he had said, but he wouldn’t budge. I guess it was that bad. Haha! 
I’m glad Disco and I are reunited though. He’s pretty good company and this will likely mean I don’t have to finish the rest of the trail by myself, which is kinda nice. Tonight we’re watching Avatar and World War Z! Probably two of my favorite films. Lol Hot Springs, NC is only like 16 trail miles away from where we currently are. So tomorrow we’ll be hostel hopping to the next place.","Flint Mountain shelter
",Hemlock Hollow Hostel,"Sep 28, Fri",17.30
V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603852,"Pretty late start this morning. Disco and I didn’t hit the trail until 10am. He seemed really worried about the late start, considering him and Buddy were always hiking by 7am and sometimes earlier. I think switching hiking partners is gonna be a bit of an adjustment for him. Lol And since we hike at very different paces, we’re more like camping buddies than hiking buddies. 
Up until today, Disco has been quite the purist with his thruhike. He’s passed every white blaze, taking no shortcuts, blue-blazes, or “bad weather bypasses”. I may have become a bad influence on him though. While eating lunch at a shelter, he asked me how many miles we had left until we reached town. I told him that he had 11 miles, but I only had 6 because I was taking a different route. He seemed annoyed, but also slightly jealous of my different hiking approach. Lol I decided I was gonna take a side trail that was previously “the old AT path to Hot Springs” as the guidebook describes it. By studying the book, I noticed that it took an 8 mile section of trail and reduced it to only 3 miles. Knowledge is power! Lol I told Disco what my plans were, but told him he should hike his own hike and that we’d meet up later in town no matter what route we took there. 
As brilliant as I am sometimes, this shortcut was not a bad idea, but an absolutely terrible idea. Not only was it the first and only time Disco had ever blue-blazed on the trail, but it was a terrible, terrible trail that left the both of up covered in bloody cuts. Lol This trail was 3 straight miles of thorny, spikey overgrowth up to your shoulders that you literally had to swim through. It was obvious that no part of this trail had been maintained in YEARS. There were huge bushy trees laying across the trail that you had to weave in and out of. My hair got caught in every thorn bush. My forearms are now covered in bloody scratches from using them as shields to cover my face. This literally now sits at the top of “the worst decisions Amanda has made on trail” list. Lol 
The funny part though is that Disco followed me into this and was right behind me the entire time, and I never noticed him until we were about halfway through it. I got way ahead of him after lunch and wasn’t entirely sure if he was gonna take the shortcut. When I veered off the AT and started to go down the brambley side trail, the terrain began to change pretty drastically and I was 100% convinced that Disco would probably turn back if he saw this. No way in hell did I think he’d push through 3 miles of bushwhacking. But then here I am tearing through walls of thorns with my headphones turned up full blast and all of sudden feel someone tapping me on the shoulder. He scared the shit out of me! Lol I had no idea he was behind me. I was shocked and instantly apologetic for leading him into impending doom. He was way calmer and in much higher spirits than I expected him to be. I thought surely I’d get chastised for my “genius idea”. He kept saying “Because of you, I’ll have some crazy stories to tell now!” Haha!
Along with the dozens of flesh wounds we acquired, we still managed to save a whole 2 hrs of time by taking the side trail and Disco seemed to be very happy with that. By 3:00, we were sitting in Hot Springs at the Iron Horse Station restaurant drinking soda and eating good food. I even bought Disco a beer for surviving the day and still having faith in me. Lol
We’re staying in town at Elmer’s Sunny Inn, which is an old Victorian house owned and maintained by this older guy who runs a B&B/hostel out of it. I was gonna stay at this different/cheaper hostel, but apparently Buddy is staying at that one and neither of us really wanna see him. Lol Elmer’s place is like something out of a movie though. It’s chalk-full of antiques and old furnishings. There’s tons of rooms with weird connecting hallways, closets, and half-baths. All the rooms have 2-3 beds. And not bunks, but like real beds with mattresses and stuff which is nice. Lol Our room has a plaque on the outside of the door stating that Earl Shaffer stayed in this very room nearly a hundred years ago! Earl Shaffer was the first person to ever hike the entire AT in one continuous season - real trail legend. The room has pictures of him and some of his poetry framed up on the walls. It’s pretty cool and Disco seems to be in awe of it all. We plan to zero in Hot Springs for two days, so I’m really looking forward to being lazy for awhile. These might actually be my last zeros for the rest of my trip!","Hemlock Hollow Hostel

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603853,"Hot Springs is a cool, little hiker town. The AT goes right down main street and all the shops are super hiker friendly. There also seems to be a big Harley scene here because there’s tons of motorcycles passing through. There’s zero cell reception in town for both AT&T and Version people, so I spent a lot of time hanging out at the local coffee shop that has WiFi. There’s only like 4 restaurants in town, but all of them happen to have 1-2 really good vegan/vegetarian options, so I’m really living it up today. 
It’s crazy how close I’m getting to the end. Over 1,900 miles completed, with only 274 miles left! The Smokies are only a 2-day hike away. After that’s done, I’m gonna be chanting “victory lap!” until the end. Also, it looks like I’m gonna be flying back to Texas now instead of having my dad pick me up. It was a cool idea to have someone rooting for me at the finish line, but logistically it’s just not gonna work. No matter how hard I try to slow down, I can’t hold out for the 26th. It just requires too much waisted time. So it looks like I’ll be finishing around Oct 16th probably, but since I’m on my own time now that date is pretty flexible. 
One of the things Disco mentioned yesterday on our way into town was that tonight he was gonna “let go and get fucked up.” His words, not mine. Lol And remember, Disco is in his mid-60s, so hearing this was quite comical. There’s two bars in town and we hit up both of them for several hours. But get this, the county voted out hard liquor, so you can’t buy whiskey or anything for like miles! So watching Disco get drunk off of beer was time consuming, but entertaining nonetheless. 
This sounds weird to say, but tonight felt like one of the most “adult” nights of my entire life. Lol I literally sat at a bar with a handful of people much older me, drinking hard cider, listening to live music, participating in meaningless tipsy conversation, and then had to herd home a 60-something, drunk Disco arm-and-arm. Like it was fun, but I’ve also never felt so out of place. Lol 
Getting Disco back to the hostel was a challenge. Drunk people are annoying. Especially when they’re older than your dad, but acting like an 18 yr old who’s just had their first beer. Lol When we got back to the room, I noticed that Disco had left his entire food bag and all his gear spread out across his bed. So before I could put him to bed, we had to organize all his shit back into his pack. And at this point he’s just rambling and completely useless, so it’s mainly me doing the work and him just getting in the way. And then when I finally get him in his bed and turn off the light, he continues to talk and shout random questions from across the room. “How many miles do we have left? How many days will we spend in The Smokies? What’s our next town stop?..” I think I’m gonna kill him. It’s like real-life baby sitting, but he’s an adult and I hate children. Lol","Hot Springs, NC

Lol I feel like after today things are really gonna start moving quick. I pretty much have a loose plan for the rest of the trip in terms of where I’ll be staying each night, what towns I’m hitting, etc. The next trail town is Fontana Dam, NC, which is 6 days out. Carrying 6 days worth of food is kind of a pain in the ass (like a minimum of 12 lbs). So instead, I bought 6 days worth of food, kept 2 days and mailed the other 4 days ahead to a hostel that I’ll be staying at in two nights just along the trail. I know, pretty genius right? Sometimes my ideas are good and don’t invoke bushwhacking through a jungle. Lol Disco was impressed, so he followed suit. 
Spent the day being extra lazy and eating way too much food. I feel pregnant. I was talking a lot about the PCT today with Disco, and now I think I got him thinking about doing it too. Lol Getting close to the end really makes you reconsider everything. Like everything that once brought me so much pain and agony on trail, will soon probably be very missed. Missed so much that I’m desperately desiring to drag myself through an entirely different, more complex trail NEXT year. Lol
Disco is an interesting character. I don’t know what it’s gonna be like going forward and camping with Disco without Buddy around. Even though they didn’t get along very well, they at least kept each other distracted enough to where I could disappear off to myself without either of them noticing. But now Disco just has me and no one else, so I get subjected to the billions of random questions and useless conversations. Like I pretty much know Disco’s entire life story now, and how his marriage is falling apart, and how he’s bored with retirement, and how he came out on the trail to give himself a clear head and figure out what to do with his life going forward, etc. It’s all kinda sad honestly, but what I am supposed to do with this information?? I’m no marriage counselor. Lol I feel like there’s a lot of pressure on me now to be “the better hiking partner” and make sure he finishes this trail on the up and up. But at this point, I’m not really sure if I wanna hike with Disco for the next two weeks straight.

We beat sunrise leaving the hostel, so we stopped at the local diner real quick for breakfast. Hiking on a super full stomach is hard, but so worth it. There were some long ass climbs going out of Hot Springs and back up to the mountain ridge. I was cursing though, while Disco fell back. He has hip-joint problems in the mornings. Lol
The trail is starting to look a lot busier as we get closer to The Smokies. Lots of people out here doing 1-2 week trips. Tonight Disco and I decided to breeze past the shelter and camp on top of Max Patch instead, which is this really grassy bald with a 360 view of the mountains. It’s a pretty well known spot on the trail, but little did I know that there was a parking lot literally less than a mile from the summit. So there’s way more people camping up here than I expected to find on a Tuesday night. There’s like a party of 10 in giant tents doing some glamping, several different couple-tents, some college kids shooting some artsy video for film club (I asked), a girl with a kite, and what looks like a newly engaged couple doing a photo shoot. Lol We’re the only thruhikers though. But besides all the people, we’re getting a killer sunset! It’s a little cloudy, but the sky is changing colors like every 5 minutes.

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604247,"Unfortunately, we did not get a sunrise this morning. Max Patch was completely socked in. We woke up in a wet, foggy cloud. And apparently Disco didn’t sleep well. The big group of glampers last night stayed up pretty late partying. I had earplugs in though, so I slept through it all. 
Today was Disco’s Aunt’s 100th birthday, so I got to overhear that phone call this morning which was pretty comical. For being 100 yrs old, this woman still very much has her mind. She knew a lot about the AT and had tons of questions for him. “Where are you? What state? How many miles left?” Disco had the call on speaker phone and kept looking at me for the answers to these questions. Well, heck if I know. I didn’t have the guidebook on hand, so I’ll I knew was that we were standing on top of some mountain, in either Tennessee or North Carolina, with around 250 miles to go. That wasn’t that great of an answer, but its a lot harder to know where you are out here sometimes than you would think.
Also, I made the mistake of telling Disco that I blog everyday and that he’s a “character” in my stories. Now every time he says or does something he thinks is funny he follows it up with “Now that was blog worthy!” Lol Kill me. 
We ended up doing a short day and hiked into Standing Bear Hostel around 1pm, which was down a little gravel road in the middle of nowhere. We had to stop there to pick up our food package we had sent ahead for The Smokies. But since Disco wasn’t feeling 100, we decided to stay and pay for a tent site.
There’s a guy working at the hostel that goes by Rhino. He’s an ex-Marine in his mid-40s. Super chill dude. He hiked the PCT last year, so I bombarded him with hundreds of questions. It seems doable, but definitely hard. A lot less people thruhike the PCT than the AT apparently. It’s just a lot more remote in some areas and the elements associated with the trek are harder. It’s like some next level shit. He also told me about this super cool website called coolworks.com. It’s a site full of job postings all over the country in really cool places. You can surf the site by job category or season. There’s currently tons of seasonal job listings for ski resorts and lodges in places like Colorado and Utah. And the cool part is that the jobs usually come with room and board, a meal plan, and all-access ski time on off-days. How dope is that! AND it’s not super permanent. Most only last from Nov-April, so I wouldn’t be locked in. I think a job of that nature would be ideal for me since it involves being in cool, outdoorsy areas and doesn’t trap me forever which is something I’m trying desperately to avoid. There’s a freedom in trail-life that can’t be matched anywhere else. I’d do anything at this point to try and hold on to that. 
The hostel has a small, little resupply store/snack shack. Amongst the cobwebs, I found a can of expired VEGAN shredded taco “meat” filling. And since it was expired, I got it for FREE! Don’t ask me when it expired though. Okay, maybe October of last year. Lol! But does textured soy protein in a can really ever go bad?? I’m taking the gamble on this one. It makes my usual, plain Ramen noodle dinner much more exciting. Oh geez, how the standards have dropped. 
Tomorrow we embark into The Smokies, which is pretty much the last really cool section of the trail. I have some big couple of days planned ahead, and I’m curious if Disco will be able to hang because I’m not slowing down.

This early discomfort got me moving though. We were back on trail by 7:30am. I knew today was gonna be a bitch and had been mentally preparing for it for awhile. It was all uphill to reach the ridge line of The Smokies. The first climb was a steady 7 miles long. I have to say though, I’ve gotten pretty good at this hiking thing. When going uphill, I just lock in a consistent pace and don’t stop. For 7 miles of up I didn’t stop one time. I’m a hiking machine! #DontStopTillTheTop
I’ve started to take note of the current condition of my gear and well, a lot of it is pretty much toasted. A zipper split on one of my hip-belt pockets the other day, so that was a bummer. My trekking poles are complete nubs on the bottom and the wrist handles are hanging by a thread. My second pair of hiking shoes have nearly a thousand miles on them again, so they’re shot. Oh and my Nike hiking shorts that I’ve been wearing everyday for this entire trail have a huge, gaping hole in the crotch region that seems to be getting larger by the day. I’ll be damned though if I have to replace anything this close to the end. Lol
The Smokies is tagged as the “most visited” section of the whole AT. It’s not the “most hiked” because the majority of people that visit the Smokey Mountains don’t actually do any hiking. Lol But, that being said, I’m starting to see a lot more people on the trail. Also, this area was in the news recently because just a couple days ago a woman was day-hiking, got lost off trail in a thunderstorm, and went missing. A big section of the trail was closed off to all road-access while search parties were out. For several days, only hikers on foot were allowed to pass through. But the woman’s body was just found yesterday. She died of hypothermia sadly. Pretty crazy stuff. 
The Smokey Mts Park has some weird rules. Everyone is required to sleep in the shelters, so no camping/tenting. But if a shelter fills up, AT thruhikers must move out of the shelter to their tent and give their spot to any weekender/sectioner that shows up. This is because the weekenders/sectioners get to reserve/pay for spots in the shelters online, but thruhikers do not. So really weird, fucked system. The point is that I have to sleep in this shelter tonight with Disco and like six other snoring dudes and not super stoked about it. 
Disco gets so weird when we’re around other hikers that aren’t “thruhikers”. He acts super extra, all high and mighty, flaunting the “thruhiker status.” It’s embarrassing, honestly, and quite childish. I tried to explain to him that not everyone is impressed by hiker trash. Like, we smell. Lol He was shocked that I called him on his shit, but I think he gets it now. He’s acting all tough and confident today, but I got a really big day planned for us tomorrow and I’m not sure if he’ll be able to hang. This will be a day where the “real thruhiker” shines.

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604249,"Today was a very full, long day. It was Marathon Day! Today was the first time I did a full marathon on trail, an exact 26.2 miles between shelters. There were other shelters in between that I could have stopped at, but they were 0.5 off trail. So I said no way! And did a marathon instead. Lol
Since yesterday was the long climb up to the ridge line, today was just a lot of ups and downs over the peaks. Not a whole lot of streams/springs this high up, so we had to do a 12.5 mile water carry. Luckily, I’ve gotten pretty good at rationing water. I can make 1 liter last me 15 miles if I have too. Not very healthy, but doable if necessary. 
Disco caught up to me around lunchtime. We do breaks very differently. I just take one long hour and half lunch break everyday and spend the rest of the day hiking without stopping. Whereas Disco takes a bunch of 10-15 minute breaks throughout the day and never eats a full meal, just a bunch of bars. Weird. Lol
Saw tons of people on trail. The AT went across Newfound Gap, which is a dayhiker hot spot because the road there leads to Gatlinburg, TN, which is this super upitty, overpriced tourist trap of a town. I didn’t hitch into town, just breezed through this giant parking lot dodging gobs and gobs of people. A literal sea of tourists. Everyone comes to this spot because it’s right near Clingmans Dome tower, which is the highest point on the whole AT - sitting at 6,658 ft. It’s an 8 mile hike UP from Newfound Gap to Clingmans Dome. No one does this hike though because there’s literally a road that goes up the mountain to the tower, so everyone is driving. Except me, obviously. I didn’t see a single person on that trail the whole way up. And now I can see why because it was a bitch. Just some never-ending rock steps to the sky. Kinda felt like Maine at some parts. 
I got to the foot of the tower and had every intention of walking up there to see the views, but people just kept coming through by the bus loads. So I dropped pack, ate a snack, and just watched dozens of families meander through on this sidewalk while complaining about the heat and how much their feet hurt from the half-mile walk between their car and the tower. It was truly a sight to see. Lol Every now and then someone would tag me as a thruhiker and stop to chat with me. This sweet, older Asian couple was completely blown away when I told them I had traversed the AT from here to Maine. They jokingly took their hats off and bowed. Lol! It was great. 
I spent most of the day thinking Disco was trudging along somewhere way behind me because I’d passed him up again after lunch. But then I rolled into the shelter this evening around 6:30pm and who do I see?? Disco, that little rat! He beat me by an hour and a half. He jumped in a car with some tourists at Newfound Gap and got shuttled all the way up to the tower. Yellow-blazing hoe. It’s all good though because now we both got some dirt on each other. Lol He was intimidated by my plans to do a whole marathon in one day, but wanted desperately to keep up with me. So yellow-blazing was his only real option if he didn’t want to kill himself in the process. Lol I’m just stoked that I can FINALLY say that I hiked a conplete marathon with a 30 lb pack through the Smokey Mountains. Tonight definitely calls for a heavy dose of Vitamin I, but it was all worth it.","Tricorner Knob shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604250,"Today started with a really brisk morning. The weather has been great for us in The Smokies, but the nights get hella cold. Like in the mid 40s. Disco and I didn’t sleep too great last night. The people at the shelter were super loud and created all sorts of commotion in the middle of the night. Considering the lack of sleep and my previous marathon day, I was literally dragging myself down the trail. I was exhausted, but somehow still managed to crunch out a near 20 mile day. 
I miss all the Virginia switchbacks. You don’t see a whole lot of them these days. When the elevation chart shows you’re going up, now it means STRAIGHT up. There were some nasty climbs today. Short, but unbelievably steep. Gradients that reminded me a lot of Vermont. 
I’m super surprised to see Disco at this shelter tonight. He was dying earlier and talking about staying at a shelter 3 miles back. I think I’m pushing him hard because I know I’ve definitely been pushing myself. I keep telling him to HYOH, but he keeps racing to keep up with me apparently. Lol I’m sure tomorrow he’ll start complaining that I’m killing him. Tomorrow, we hike out of The Smokies and down to Fontana Dam. Completing The Smokies in 3.5 days is quite a feat. We’ve been killing it. I can’t imagine being a NoBo though and having to hike this terrain on like week two of the journey. This would be a tough place to start. All day I pass these people out here hiking for a week and they don’t have their trail legs, so they’re essentially crawling. It looks like a grueling vacation honestly. Lol I was definitely struggling today, especially with the poor sleep from these crowded shelters and my super big day yesterday. I’m glad I pushed through though. Tonight, Disco and I are breaking park rules and sleeping in our tents near the shelter. We really need one good night of rest and this is the only way it’ll happen. 
Lots of people at the shelter tonight, but they’re all really cool, nice dudes. One guy went through the effort to get a campfire going, which isn’t something I’ve had the luxury of experiencing since Maine. There’s another guy here named Mango who spent the evening basically turning my world upside down. Lol He jumped on the AT in Roan Mt, TN headed south just a couple weeks ago. He plans to hike to Springer Mt and then keep going south all the way through Alabama on a different trail. It involves hiking on the Benton Mackaye Trail for about 80 miles and then connects to the Pinhoti Trail, which is like another 330 miles. I already knew that these trails existed, but to meet someone who actually plans to hike them is interesting. It kinda gives me an itch, you know. To just like keep going! I cornered this dude and asked him hundreds of questions about what guides he’s using, his timeframe and mileage plans, Alabama weather, etc. I feel like my head is gonna explode. I was supposed to purchase my plane ticket tomorrow while in town, but now here’s this guy giving me all the information I need (and encouragement) to just keep on hiking and living the wayward trail life for as long as I can. It’s insane, but absolutely doable. I don’t know how I’m gonna sleep tonight. I have way too much to think about now.","Double Springs Gap shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604251,"Disco left an hour before me this morning, but I still managed to beat him to town. I ran into Mango on my way down the trail and talked with him more about the Pinhoti trail while we hiked. Omg, it’s all so tempting. You have no idea. And apparently you can jump off that trail at some point, get on this river, and canoe all the way down to the Gulf of fucking Mexico! Forget flying back to Texas, I could just hike/paddle/hitch all the way there! Lol
Ran into a black bear on trail today just like a mile before leaving The Smokey Mt park! I legit almost ran into him though. There was like 6 miles of downhill trail going into town, so I was basically running through this whole section. And right as I was making this sharp turn around a bend, the bear just appears right in the middle of the trail! And this little dude actually tried to stand his ground! He was huffing and puffing up a storm at me. Lol It was crazy cool. Eventually he ran away though, and I hiked on in one piece. 
Got to hike across the Fontana Dam, which is one of the largest dams of the south I think. I hitched from there into town to resupply and get food. The town is Fontana Village and it’s not really a town, but more like a bid lodge/resort property with a couple places to eat, sleep, and resupply. My original plan was just to get food and then hike out and stay at the next shelter, which has the nickname “Fontana Hilton” because it has showers and real bathrooms for hikers. Lol But Disco, with all his money and super plush hiking lifestyle, has convinced me to split a hotel room with him. The hotel/lodge gives thruhikers a pretty good discount, so it’s only $80 for the two of us to stay here. I’ll admit though, I feel extremely out of place. This is the nicest place I’ve stayed on trail yet. 
I’m getting really stressed about finishing. I need time and space to think. Space that probably doesn’t involve so much Disco. Lol I was supposed to book a flight home today, but I couldn’t do it. 10 days people! There’s no way I’m just hopping on a plane and flying away from all of this in 10 days. I think I’m just gonna keep going. There, I said it. “But you can’t just hike forever Amanda?! You gotta rejoin society at some point.” I know this. Just maybe only when I absolutely have too. I don’t know. I give up. I’m done planning life. 
By the way, shout out to my grandparents Jimmy and JoJo! Today is there 57th wedding anniversary. You think I’m impressive for committing to a trail for 5 months, well how about one person for 57 years! I think that takes the cake. Love you both!","Mollies Ridge shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604252,"Disco and I got a pretty late start to today. There’s something about windows with curtains separating you from the sun that just doesn’t inspire you to do much beyond sleep. Lol Even with all the comfy amenities, I really didn’t sleep great. Got to much shit on the mind. We had a big breakfast at the lodge, where I drank an entire pitcher of sweet tea (literally). That woke me up. Then, we got shuttled back to the trailhead and were hiking at 9am. 
I finally got cell reception after making the big climb out of Fontana Village. Touched based with the crew and fam back home. I felt a lot better about my current situation after some of those calls. I learned that the direction of my life at the moment probably seems unconventional to some, but I’m happy and it’s working. So why stop? I’ve been wanting to get out of a Texas my whole life and now I’m finally out. So I think I should just GO, you know. Where? No idea. But for one of the first times in my life I don’t need a plan, my next step isn’t engraved in stone, and it’s truly the best feeling in the world. Trail-life has given me so much freedom. Out here there’s no pressures, expectations, commitments, or constraints. I get to just LIVE. You really can’t get this anywhere else, which is why I feel like I could just keep hiking forever. Lol
But here’s another curve ball... I got an email back from one of the Colorado ski resorts/lodges I applied to yesterday, and they want to do a phone interview with me on Wednesday! Shits happening too fast. I hope I have cell reception though. Lol If I get the job, this could be the beginning of a whole other adventure, which is kinda exciting. And if I don’t, then I’ll just keep hiking until some other opportunity presents itself. 
The bottom line is this though. I’m a hot mess, a rollercoaster of thoughts and emotions. I come up with a new “life plan” at least four times a day. Disco is real tired of hearing about all them.

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604262,"Today was a pretty chill, nice day. We made it a short day and spent most of it hanging out at the Nantahala Outdoor Center. The NOC is this big touristy, adventure-central hotspot. It has cabins, a bunkhouse, restaurants, general store, an outfitter, etc. Kind of a similar set up to Fontana Village except it’s mainly known as a white water rafting hub. The Nantahala river goes right through the center/complex. You can sit on the porch of the restaurant, eat a good meal, and watch the rafters and kayakers go by. So that’s pretty much what Disco and I did all day. We did a 10 mile hike down trail to the NOC, which luckily the AT passed right through. We hung out for about 5 hrs, resupplied, ate way too much food, then hiked out one mile to the nearest campsite. We actually ate two meals, both lunch and dinner, at the same restaurant. Lol My stomach is painfully full and I regret it all. 
Everything at the NOC general store was insanely overpriced. Nothing had price tags on it, so I blindly spent $14 on two bags of granola. Terrible! However, the outfitter on site did Darn Tough sock exchanges, so I got a FREE pair of replacement socks because I’d worn a hole in the bottom of my current ones. Darn Tough is a popular hiking sock brand that guarantees a free, new pair of socks if you’re actually able to wear a hole through them. And us thruhikers are MORE than capable of that, so the free socks are always a nice trail perk. Too bad every gear company doesn’t have that guarantee because at this point everything I own has at least one hole in it. Lol

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604498,"Today was an interesting day. It’s rained most of the day, but stopped shortly before camp. Tonight and all day tomorrow is supposed to be terrible. Nearly 2 inches of rain expected. Luckily, I’ll be neroing into Franklin, NC, which seems like a cool little town with lots of stuff, even a Walmart!
Did a big 4 mile climb away from the NOC and back up to the ridge. Passed Disco on the way up even though he left camp an hour before me. Always feels good. Lol I stopped at a shelter for lunch around 1:30 and waited for Disco to catch up. My interview was scheduled for 3:00, but I wasn’t sure if I’d have service. So I made Disco give me his phone for the afternoon because he has Verizon. Neither phone had service during lunch though. And then I realized that I had actually passed the highest peak for the day, which was 0.7 miles north now. So I finished eating, dropped my pack, and raced back up the mountain with one phone in each hand. By this time, Disco had hiked on for the day. I got back up to the peak with about 20 minutes to spare. My phone still had no signal, but Disco’s had one bar. So I stood there in the cold rain with the phone pointed towards the sky trying to get that second bar, so that I could call this Denver Brown dude before he tried to call me. 
I finally got two bars on Disco’s phone, but now the screen was wet and my fingers were all pruny. So I literally couldn’t get the touch screen phone to work! My clothes were soaked, so I had nothing to dry it off with. And it’s still freaking raining. And then before I knew it, it was 3:15 and I’m cursing at the sky because I know I’ve missed the call. So I screwed around with the phone some more, accidentally pushed some wrong buttons and called Disco’s son in the process, then FINALLY I managed to get the recruiter’s number typed in and the dial tone began. 
“Sorry, I’m in the woods and it’s raining. Can you hear me now..?” That was my opening introduction. Lol The interview started with me being super apologetic and trying to explain that I’ve been living in the forest on the AT for five months and cell reception is a hit or miss most days. Luckily, the dude was nice. At some point, I managed to put my “professional hat” on and not sound like a piece of hiker trash in the middle of nowhere. The interview actually went really well. Supposedly, I’ll hear back by Monday with the final result. I also got an email today from a different ski resort I applied to in Utah. They want to put together an interview with me as well soon, so that’s pretty cool. Its starting to look like the next 6 months of my life might contain a lot of snow... The “seasonal job ski resort life” is starting to really grow on me. I think it could be a pretty sweet gig and allow me to experience a lot of shit that you could never get out of Texas.

My rain fly was already completely saturated from the night before, and whenever that happens it becomes pretty useless. It starts to leak little “mist drops” all through the night, leaving me to wake up in a complete puddle. I was cold and I was wet. I got all my shit together before sunrise and beat Disco on the trail. 
I could smell town in the distance. I busted out a quick 11 miles, did a 10 mile road hitch into Franklin, and was eating a veggie burger at BK by noon. Eventually I moseyed over to the Gooder Grove Hostel. It’s really the only hostel option in town right now because the other one is only seasonal. It’s a pretty nice place though. The guy running it is Zen. He’s cool, but extremely OCD and a complete clean freak. You have to put on loaner sandals before walking into the house. Then, he immediately directs you into the kitchen where he asks you to wash your hands before touching anything. Then you have to take a shower before you’re allowed to hang out in the bunk room or common area. The list goes on. I kinda get it, but this is the most intense I’ve ever seen a hostel get on trail. Lol 
I decided to take a zero day tomorrow, so today I’m cutting loose and doing an early celebration - only 109 miles left! Truly insane. Disco and I started to do a pub crawl around 3:00. Franklin actually has two breweries and like four different bars, so lots of opportunity. I’ve learned that I actually like hard ciders. Like I think it’s my thing now. Beer and wine is still gross though. Lol Around 6pm, we ended up at Mulligan’s, the town’s sports bar and the only place that stays open past 9pm. We stayed here for the rest of the evening. I introduced Disco to Jameson, the smoothest of Irish whiskey. I was having a grand time, that was until Disco started to become more and more incoherent. We literally had the same amount of alcohol and he’s blabbering like a baby and stumbling the whole way back to the hostel. I had zero patience or sympathy for him this time. He’s an adult who can’t hold his alcohol and it’s honestly embarrassing. So I let him fall. Multiple times actually. Lol 
What made it extra funny was that he had to go to Urgent Care earlier today to get some pain meds for his hip/joint problems. They prescribed him with four days worth of steroid pills. So he brings his prescription with him to the bar and asks me to read the directions to him because he doesn’t have his glasses on him. Then he gets stupid drunk, and I get to watch this 63 yr old man crawl home at 11pm while holding a prescription bag of medicine. Lol A truly sad sight. I think I’ve had my fill of Disco for the rest this trek. He’s a little too much to handle. 
On a completely different note, we heard some super crazy rumors about this Zen dude (real name Collin) that’s running the hostel we’re staying at. Apparently, he’s known as the town’s nut job. Lol Everyone at the bar seemed to know the guy. And they all used the word “crazy” at some point to describe him. From what I could grasp, it seems like he has a history of offering hikers WFS and then when the “work” is finished, he continues to find something else for them to do, arguing that they still owe him something. And becomes extremely hostile when hikers disagree and try to leave, so much that a girl at the bar was claiming to have “rescued” about a dozen hikers over the years by picking them up in her car and removing them from the property. Lol! Trail-talk is real and never disappoints. I didn’t know what to make of these stories. All I could think was “Damn, I wish I hadn’t just accepted the WFS offer Zen made to me before coming down here...” Haha! Yikes! Let’s hope I don’t get trapped!!","Wayah Bald shelter

“What.”
“My brain really hurts.”
“It’s called a hangover Disco. Grow the fuck up.”
I’ve learned some interesting things about Disco recently. One, he doesn’t carry toothpaste and only brushes his teeth with water and the toothbrush. Disgusting. Lol Two, he also doesn’t carry a water FILTER. Meaning he has never once on this entire trail filtered the water he’s been drinking. Whether it be from a spring, pond, river, or creek - he just takes the gamble and drinks it straight up! He swears he’s never had any issues the entire time, but I think that’s just insane. 
Shit keeps breaking on me people. Only got like 100 miles left and the strap on my bra finally withered away completely and snapped yesterday. I guess I’m going braless until the end. I also managed to punch a huge hole straight through the bottom of the stuff-sack that keeps my tent together. Why, whhyyyyyyy. 
So there’s a smell that I often smell on trail in the woods and I could never exactly put my finger on what it was and where it was coming from. But I think that mystery has finally been solved. Today Disco asked me if I ever thought I smelled cheese on trail? That’s when it hit me. Cheese!! Lol YES! I always get whiffs of what smells like baked macaroni and cheese while I’m hiking. He then proceeds to open his pack and stick it in my face. “Is this what you smell?” Oh my god. I couldn’t believe it. I ran over to my pile of stuff, grabbed my rain jacket, and took a sniff. Cheese. All our stuff smells like cheese. WE smell exactly like baked macaroni and cheese. Dear god. 
Another hiker wandered into the hostel this evening named Wookiee. He’s 26, and a true SoBo all the way from Maine. He’s from Georgia, so he’s basically walking home. Super cool dude. Him, Disco and I went and had dinner tonight at this small, Thai restaurant in town. Wookiee WOWed us with all his stories about living in Thailand for 3 months and working as a bartender and scuba diver guide. I grilled him with questions. You mean I can just go live and work on a beach in Thailand? I was completely fascinated. Like why not, right?
The day ended with me buying a plane ticket back to Texas for Oct 22nd. I know, fuck my life. The only thought keeping me sane is the fact that I will just be VISITING Texas. It’s just a jumping-point, not a destination. There’s a lot of important things I want back in TX, like my car, clothes, and passport. So I have to go back. Just for a bit. It’s a depressing reality, but I don’t doubt I’ll come up with some new, crazy adventure soon. And at least I’ll get to see friends and stuff. I don’t know. !KCUF","Franklin, NC

It’s was awesome. Lol
The weather today was truly amazing. Sunny and clear with a high of 68. I held a solid 3mph pace all day. Reached the top of Albert Mt by 12:30 where I ate my lunch up in this abandoned fire tower with a great view. Disco eventually caught up to me there. That’s when I broke the news and told him I was gonna hike further than planned today because I was feeling good and really wanted some space to “hike my own hike.” I started this trail alone, and I’d like to finish it alone. I’ve come way too far to let someone sour the tail end of this journey, and my tolerance was quickly reaching that point. So I hiked on. Being on the same trail and hiking in the same direction, I’m sure I’ll run into him again soon, just not today. And that helps. 
I hiked 6 miles past the shelter/campsite I had originally planned to stay at and am instead camping on top of Standing Indian Mt with a great view and KILLER sunset. There’s a lot more people up here with the same idea than I had expected to find, but it’s Saturday so I shouldn’t be too surprised. I managed to find a very secluded stealth-site at the very top of the mountain that I now have all to myself. It took a little bit of meandering through this large campsite filled with about 8 dudes and then some bushwhacking through some overgrown bramble, but then I found it. The group of 8 dudes are nice though. They’re out for the weekend and they all brought their dogs with them, all six! They’re all very nice and let me mooch off their campfire with them. It’s hella cold up here. Supposed to drop down into the lower 40s tonight with a 35 degree windchill and maybe some rain. Yay. Lol
It occurred to me today that I really only have 6 days left to truly soak up the trail and spend time with just myself. I’m planning to summit on the 20th. That’ll be here SO soon. It’s an insane feeling. I only have like 5 pages left in my guidebook and then what? The book ends. The AT ends. My trail alias as V will end.

Lol I even slept with my granola bars inside my sleeping bag, so that they wouldn’t be hard bricks by morning. It was so hard to emerge from my personal, warm cocoon. I woke up to harsh winds and cold, cold drizzle. Everything in my tent was moist from condensation. Hiking was the only thing that was gonna get me warm, so I got my shit together as quickly as I could. My hands were completely numb.

Luckily, the weather got better as the day went on and as I hiked down to lower elevation. Ran into Buddy on trail today! That old, self-centered geezer. Lol I knew it’d happen eventually. He asked about Disco, and I told him he was just less than half a day behind. Buddy wants to hike with Disco, but Disco hates Buddy. Disco wants to hike with V, but V is done with Disco.

Crossed the NC/GA state line today! I’m officially in GEORGIA. The LAST state of the AT. The victory lap. The homestretch. The final chapter. 
I got an email today that I was denied the job at Winter Park Resort in Colorado. Thankfully, it hardly phased me. It was only the first of about a hundred applications I’ll be filling out. The email, of course, didn’t say why I didn’t get the job. But I’m sure it had nothing to do with the fact that I called the interviewer “Dude”. Lol! I’m trying people. I’ve been in the woods too long for this shit. 
Hitched into Hiawassee, GA this evening. Last town stop on the AT! I was gonna stay at the Top of Georgia hiker hostel tonight, but I’ve been feeling pretty cheap these days. I learned from Mikey though, down at Big Al’s Pizza, about a free campsite in town on the beach of Chatuge Lake. It wasn’t in the guidebook, so there was really no way I would have known about it. But let me tell you, it’s badass! I showed up just in time for an insanely pink sunset that made a cotton candy colored reflection in the water. It was awesome. This is what I live for, ya know! I almost had the entire beach to myself, but then Disco hits me up with a sob story about being stranded in town. Apparently, all the motels had no vacancy and he refused to go to the hostel, so I told him about the secret beach spot and now here he is. I’m annoyed by his presence, but it’s probably for the best. The campsite is a little sketchy and really close to a busy road.

Disco hung out for a bit and then moved on. Said he was headed back to the trailhead today. I zeroed today because I have extra time between now and my flight. 
Spent most of the day hanging out by the lake submitting more online job applications. Denver Brown, the Winter Park recruiter that I did the recent phone interview with, sent a personal follow up email to me today about the position I was denied. He doesn’t do the hiring, but said it was unfortunate that a different candidate was chosen. However, he thought I was more than qualified and believed I’d be an excellent fit at the resort, so he asked for my permission to send off my application to other departments within the park. I said yes, of course. I was almost starting to think I was just some destitute, washed up, wanna-be-forever thruhiking bum, but then that email hit my inbox. You the real MVP Denver Brown. 
Eventually I made my way over to Ingles, the big grocery store in town. And it is big. I was a little overwhelmed by all the options. Today was my last resupply. Can you believe it?? Cause I can’t. To celebrate, I treated myself and bought a bunch of tasty, heavy shit that I’m sure I’ll regret halfway up the mountain tomorrow, but who cares. I should slowdown anyways. I bought blueberry bagels instead of the usual flour tortillas. Organic chocolate granola instead of peanuts and raisins. Unfrosted cinnamon Poptarts instead of breakfast bars. And a pint of vegan banana foster flavored ice cream that I shamelessly ate all in one sitting. Livin large! Also, since when is it almost Halloween?? The grocery store was stocked full of candy and decorations. When I peaced out on the world it was like Easter! Lol Time warp.
In an effort to save the monies, I hitched back to the trailhead and set up camp just about 100 yards down trail away from the road. I’m over hostels, and I’d rather sleep in my tent as much as possible at this point. I gravitated towards hostels a lot more when I started hiking south simply because that’s where I could always find people. And people were hard to come by on trail. But now I’m pretty much done with people. Lol I prefer the solace and solitude that comes with camping alone. Sleeping outside will never get old. I think I’ll miss this part the most.","Hiawassee, GA

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604541,"Today was chill. It was a mostly overcast day, but then it started raining in the afternoon and then pouring when I was only like an hour away from camp - of course. So I’m soaked and very cold. The usual. A section hiker stopped and chatted with me while I ate my lunch today. He asked if at any point on trail was all of my stuff 100% dry. I laughed and said no. Whether it be rain, humidity, condensation, or just drowning in your own sweat - everything is always damp. Lol I’m embracing it though today. I’m even tenting in the rain with my more-than-leaky rainfly. This may be the last time for awhile that I get the privilege to endure such welcomed discomfort. 
There’s several sectioners staying at the shelter tonight. One is a woman from Manchester, England out here for a 2 week hike, and she happens to be vegetarian. And an older, dad dude here tonight is also vegetarian. Well, whatya know! This is the first time ever on trail that veggies have outnumbered the omnivores. Lol 
Another upside to this shelter/campsite is that it has class-A cell reception. Like AT&T people have 3 bars and LTE! This has never happened. Lol I was able to check my email and saw that Denver Brown’s help really worked! The Ski & Ride School at Winter Park Resort in Colorado has chosen me to be apart of their winter staff. I’ll basically be assisting instructors with teaching kids on how to ski. Nevermind the fact that I’ve never skied a day in my life. Lol! But surprisingly, that wasn’t a deterring factor. I have my “hiring phone-call” with them next Tuesday (the day after my flight) to discuss expectations, pay, lodging, and other logistics. So if that goes well, I’ll be moving to Colorado for Nov-Apr!
I also got several other emails today from people wanting phone interviews. It’s kinda stressful doing this shit on trail, but whatevs. One is gonna be this Thursday with Stratton Mt Resort in Vermont. This one is kind of sentimental-ish to me. I don’t know how I’d fare living in VT (honestly, I think I’d die). But Stratton Mt is on the AT and I vividly remember the day I hiked it. It was my first BIG mileage day. I did 25.5 miles, hiking up and over Stratton Mt in a huge rainstorm, and then had my FIRST shelter stay on trail that evening at Stratton Mt Pond Shelter. That was a super long, wet day, but I remember going to sleep feeling hella accomplished. So yes, the idea of working on that mountain, seeing it in the snow, and living close to the AT (even though it’d be buried) sounds pretty sweet. We’ll see though. Running away to Thailand is still on the table. Amongst many, MANY other things. Lol","Hiawassee, GA

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604638,"Today started out pretty cold and miserable, but then the rain went away and turned into a nice, breezy day. Hardly broke a sweat. Also, shout out to my father. It’s his 60th birthday today! Go Dad!
Since the majority of thruhikers start in Georgia and go northbound, the AT in Georgia is the most heavily traversed part of the trail. Thousands of people start here every year, but only 20-25% make it to the end. There’s a 25% dropout rate by the time they reach Neel Gap, which is only 30 miles away from Springer Mt, the starting point. That’s seems insane to me! I passed through Neel Gap this evening and bought a soda at the Mountain Crossing store/hostel. I’m not staying there tonight, but I hung out for a bit and raided their hiker box. I hit the motherload! This is a big dayhiker hotspot, so there were tons of good snacks left behind. I got like 4 bagels, 3 applesauce cups, 5 granola bars, a bag of trail mix, and 2 tent spikes - which finally completes my collection! Also at Neel Gap is this giant famous tree full of hiker boots. It’s nicknamed “the quitter tree.” Apparently, if you quit at Neel Gap, it’s tradition to tie your boots together and throw them up in the tree. Lol! And let me tell you, there’s a lot of boots! And most look brand new! Unbelievable. I feel so lucky to have made it this far. So many things could have pulled me off the trail (injury, illness, family death, etc). I saw it happen to a lot of people. I’m sitting just TWO days away from the finish line now! That’s so surreal. I remember my first day on trail as if it were yesterday. I had no idea what the fuck I was doing. Lol I was just moving forward, everyday, one step at a time. And now I’m literally almost there. 
I ran into Wookiee at Neel Gap! He’s the SoBo I met in Franklin. We hiked on together another mile and are stealth camping about halfway up Blood Mt. Blood Mt. is the biggest climb on the AT in Georgia. The locals give it a lot of hype, but I’m pretty sure it’s just another big, steep hill. I’ll be hitting it first thing tomorrow morning, so I’ll report back. Camping with Wookiee is a cool surprise though. He zeroed in Franklin and still caught up! Dude did like 27 miles today! Crazy. It was fun reliving parts of the trail with him. All of our experiences for the northern section were slightly different since we were going opposite directions. It’s crazy to think but like at some point we would have crossed each other’s paths. Like at some point during the northern section, probably like Vermont, we were right on top of each other, but never met! Funny how the trail works.","Blue Mountain shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604639,"Last night was terribly cold and windy. I hardly slept at all. But it ended up being another beautiful, clear day. I’m so grateful for these days, especially with tomorrow being my LAST day. OMG. 
By the way, Blood Mt was a breeze. Lol I can see how it’d be kinda hard for NoBos who start here because it had its steep moments. But at this point, I’m like whatever. What’s one more climb? One more mountain? Show me something I can’t do! Lol
I had some REAL trail magic today! First time since I flipped south! I had already concluded that no one cared about the early southbound flipfloppers, but then here was Navister with a cooler of soda and beer in the parking lot at Woody Gap. Navister is in his 30s and from Georgia. He actually did a northbound thruhike of the AT THIS year and just finished in September. It was really cool chatting with him. And Wookiee was there too. Between the three of us, every “type” of thruhike was represented: NoBo, SoBo, and FlipFlop. It was interesting to compare the differences in all our experiences. Same trail, but very different stories. 
I reached camp around 4:30. Wookiee showed up just minutes after me. That’s when I looked at him and was like “Dude, if we really wanted too, we could summit Springer Mt TODAY!” We had just done 16 miles and the summit to Springer Mt was another 14 away. I had never done a 30 mile day, and I’d also never night hiked. Wookiee had never done either of these things as well, and what’s a better time to do it then your LAST night on trail, right!? Wookiee paused and looked at me long and hard... “Damn you!” Lol I caught him off guard with the idea, but he was tempted nonetheless. The only real issue though was Wookiee’s knees. His knees give him a lot of problems. They pop a lot and he wears braces and stuff. He knew he could do the 30 miles, but he’d probably kill himself in the process. So we decided to keep hiking with the intent to summit, but knowing that in reality we’d probably camp somewhere along the way. And long story short, we camped somewhere along the way. Lol We stopped and threw up our tents just after sundown. We knocked out an extra 6 miles, leaving only 8 miles now between us and the end. EIGHT MILES HOLY FUCK. I’m so close I can taste it. None of it seems real at this point. None of it.","Flatrock Gap campsite

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604640,"It’s so hard to put this day into words, but I’ll do my best.  
While I was hiking this morning and listening to my music on shuffle, a song came on called Heading Home by Gryffin. That’s when it hit me. It feels like I’m going home. It feels like I’ve been on a very long pilgrimage headed not towards a place necessarily, but a feeling. That’s when I realized that my home isn’t Texas, or even Springer Mt. Home for a thruhiker is a feeling that can only be reached at the terminus of one’s hike. I’ve been hiking for so long, hurdling so many walls on the trail and in my head. And it all comes down to this. I feel like everything in my life has been leading up to this moment. For some, that moment is their wedding day, the birth of their kids, etc. But for me, it’s this trail, completing this hike. In the beginning, I could never fathom the finish line. It was way too far off. A dream that hardly seemed real or in sight. But it’s here. It’s today!
I couldn’t have asked for a better day to finish my hike. It was sunny, 65 degrees. And because of the extra distance I put in yesterday, I only had 8 miles until the summit. I was trying so hard to take it all in, but I was running. Hiking Springer Mt is nothing like hiking Katadhin in Maine, but it still meant everything to me. During these past couple of days, I was worried I’d get to the summit and just feel numb. No emotion. No way to process the moment. But then I got there. There were about a dozen dayhikers and sectioners up there, and then also Wookiee and Disco. Disco saw me and immediately announces “Here’s another finisher!” I looked up at the small crowd and instantly fell apart. I dropped pack and ran back down the mountain about half a mile. I’ve never felt so overwhelmed in my life. 
You know that pause you feel at the end of a really good book? Like the end was always inevitable, but there’s almost a sense of shock that it’s arrived? You can see the end nearing as the pages between your fingers become thinner and thinner. You probably have already guessed the ending by now, or at least know some of it, but you can never really anticipate the feeling the closing words will give you. And then before you know it, you’re there. You’re on the last page. It’s finished. 
That’s kinda how I feel. But instead of reading a book, I’ve been experiencing the development of my own story. A story that just so happens to be 2,190.9 miles long, across 14 states, within 156 days. And now I’m sitting on my very last page. Specifically, I’m sitting by a fireplace in the lobby of a fancy lodge (thankfully on Disco’s credit card) at the base of Springer Mt in Amicalola State Park, staring up at this giant 3-story map of the Appalachian Trail thinking HOT DAMN! I just did that shit. 
It’s honestly a lot to fully process in one day. All I can say now is that this is truly the best day of my life. I’ve never felt so accomplished, so capable, so proud. The day you realize you can literally do ANYTHING - that’s a good day. So I’ll sit in this plush lobby and stare at this huge AT map that was at one point just a picture of a dream, a big whim, a “bucket list” token. But now it’s a reality. It’s a history. It’s my story.
Stay tuned for some more sappy, deep shit. I’ll share The Lists and pour out my soul concerning everything I’ve learned and gained! But for now, I’m gonna take a really long nap.","Hawk Mountain shelter

V! - “Veal for Vendetta” ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604645,"A couple months before my hike, I read a book called Appalachian Trials: The Mental and Emotional Guide to Thruhiking the AT. It was written by a guy with the trail name The Good Badger, who thruhiked a couple years ago. The whole book was really insightful, but the most helpful part was at the beginning when Badger asks you to make three lists. I found it really important to make these lists and keep them with me because on the bad days, when the shit gets really tough, it’s so easy to forget why you started all this. Why you gave up a life of comfort for the life of extreme. I kept my lists with me the whole time and reading them now at the very end truly puts into perspective how far I’ve come. And I’ve come SO far. 
1 ) I am thruhiking the AT because...

I need to prove to myself and others that I can. 
I need change and adventure. 
I need a new beginning, the start of a new chapter. 
It’s the opportunity of a lifetime and it might not come again. 
I crave a challenge. 
I’ve always wanted too since I learned about it. 
I want time and a space to evaluate what I want most out of life. 
I want to test my limits. 
I want to develop a new approach/perspective to life. 
I want to grow.

2 ) When I successfully thruhike the AT I will...

Have an unbeknownst confidence in myself. 
Be mentally and emotionally independent of others. 
Be in my greatest physical shape yet. 
Have a clearer vision of my future. 
Accomplished the most challenging physical feat of my life. 
Checked one off the bucket list. 
Soaked up everything one life has to offer within just six months. 
Taken complete advantage of my youthfulness. 
Proved people wrong. 
No longer fear loneliness. 
Beat statistics. 
Discover what I value most in life. 
Have learned to love every part of myself. 

3 ) If I give up on the AT I will...

Be a disappointment to myself and others. 
Be lost and depressed. 
Doubt myself and what I’m capable of. 
Feel ashamed. 
Taint the entire experience with failure. 
“Settle” in all aspects of life afterwards. 
Die with regret. 
Constantly have to explain and justify my failure to others. 
Become reliant again on others for mental and emotional support. 
Have to face “real life” sooner than planned. 
Have lost friends, money, time, and a steady job all for nothing. 

Looking back at this, I can truthfully say that I got everything I wanted out of this trail and so, so much more. It was more than overcoming the mountains and miles. It was getting stuck in my head for hours day in and day out. It was overcoming my mind, my anxieties, my fears, my doubts, my insecurities. I’ve finally learned to live with myself and be comfortable with every part of me. Some of my hardest days involved me being cold, wet, tired and alone. But the only way out is through. Instead of quitting, I learned how to thrive. I found comfort within all the discomfort. And peace within my chaotic mind. I learned that the universe laughs at my attempts to control and plan my little world. Because in reality, everything is so temporary, so fleeting. Sometimes plan, but most of the time just go. Let the good and bad come as it is. I’m better at adapting than I once thought. Every limit placed upon me is artificial. I’ve truly never felt so capable, so free. It’s a beautiful thing to realize the whole world is right in front of you and all you have to do is reach out and grab it. You’ll never hear me say the words “I can’t” again. Because I definitely can... I DID.",,View Entry,"Oct 20, Sat",0
