Need to pick up a lighter stove(probably a BRS) and a new pot(evernew Ti mug pot) to drop some weight. Had a beer with Chip (Cathole) yesterday and now the itch is getting worse. He's leaving this Saturday. I am waiting for Mike to retire in late April so we won't start until early May. If he backs out I will be starting mid-April. Need to finish up the taxes, and prepare the home so things run smoothly(?) while I'm gone.",,View Entry,"Feb 15, Thu",0

Worn Miles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584421,"I took a class at the Princeton REI. Very Informative. Postcard presented a great lecture. Met Dave who will be starting this year. We spoke for a while and now we will be travelling to Gainsville together by train. He's a lot younger than I so I hope our hiking style and pace are similar. It also came as a surprise that he lives 8 miles up the road in beautiful Belmar. We took a ride out to REI yesterday to check out the garage sale. Got some good cheap gear. More stuff to carry, ugh! Really looking forward to this.",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Sun",0
Worn Miles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585558,"Dave and I decided to take a hike to test out our packs and conditioning. We picked a beautiful day to hike. The sky couldn't have been more blue. The hike was a bit difficult since we had to post hole through a foot and a half of snow. Our plan was to hike to the Fingerboard shelter and back but as we reached the Long Path/AT intersection it looked like darkness we be upon us during our return. So we did an about face. Stopped to have a snack and boil up some hot cocoa with some magic marshmallows, which caused an outbreak of jokes and sarcasm.My Exos 58 felt great on my back. Weighing in at 31 lbs I hardly felt it on my back. Fit and balance were not an issue. Dave's pack weighed about the same but he has some stability issues which I'm sure he has corrected by now.Stopped at the Stone House Inn for a pizza and some cold brews and some good local company. Great place. Been there several times for A'pres hike(?)This week I'll be assembling and finalizing my mail drops. In 15 days we will beginning our thru hike at Amicalola Falls, GA.","Elk Pen

Met up with 2017 thru hiker Henry ""Vietnam Vet"" and talked for hours. He has some great trail stories as well a some helpful trail tips. Former Marine with no tibia in his left leg, he's hiking the trail again because he' s got nothing better to do. A very pleasant man to have a conversation with. Turns out were on the same shuttle to the trail head. Dave needs a tooth pulled so were trying to plan that diversion. 9 hours to go on this rattled. As futile as it may be I'm gonna try to get some shuteye.","On the train

Worn Miles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587367,I'm making this entry 3 days into my hike  because of the lack of self service .  And your 10  10  your 10  sorry I will shuttle driver planted the seed of doubt in our heads and offered to take us straight up to Springer Mountain rather than climb the stairs at Amicalola Falls. So that's what we decided to do. It saves us about a day of hiking. Dave and I are not ashamed because we heard the woes in the people who did. It was an easy hike just a few climbs with nothing tough and we made it to the shelter around 3:34 in the afternoon promtly made lunch and settled in to hang out. Met up with another group of guys thru hiking the trail and we've been hanging out with them ever since..,"Springer Mtn

Worn Miles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587369,this is the post I should have made yesterday but again the lack of cell service prevented me from doing it. Again it was a nice easy walking to go to shelter 8 .1 miles and we arrived and mid-afternoon and hung out with the group joking around. The Ridge Runner at the shelter was a bit rough around the edges telling everyone that where they should camp and you can't do this you can't do that etcetera. We all had laughs at his expense. Got pretty cold last night and today it feels great walking in the cool weather.,"

The downhill side was worse but it ended at Mountain crossing hostel at Neel Gap. They also have an extensive resupply. Ate a large pizza and drank 2 sodas then continued on. The group is still together minus Dave who seems to prefer to be alone and Mike who rode into town to get a cortisone shot for his painful knees. Headed to Unicoi Gap tomorrow to catch a ride into Helen for shower, laundry, etc to beat a nasty storm headed this way.","Jarrard Gap

Worn Miles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588466,Got an early start this morning. Climbing steadily all morning until I approached Courthouse bald which was pretty steep. Weather was overcast and a bit chilly. Just after crossing the border into North Carolina it started to rain. Stopped at the top to refill some water and have lunch. At this point it was just a drizzle but in a short time it was raining really really hard. Chicago Dave and I made it to muskrat Creek shelter. We stayed at the shelter and made some tea to warm ourselves up but I was soaked to the skin and starting to shiver so I decided to stay at the shelter. Dave compass and Sam chose to push on another 5 miles in the pouring rain to Standing Indian shelter. I stayed with an older man named George and lauralinda. About an hour later a gentleman showed up and said there were about 10 more people coming. We crammed 10 people into a seven-person shelter while more came later and were forced to tent. We sat there all afternoon and night listening to the Rain beat down on the tin roof of the shelter. Rain is still in the forecast for tomorrow but it's supposed to clear up in the afternoon.,"

Worn Miles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588467,"woke up around 6 to get an early start. Cooked breakfast, packed up and started hiking. The rain let up about 10 a.m. and the Sun finally broke out soon after. The climb up Standing Indian Mountain what is sharp and steady. Reaching the summit at around 11:30 I found myself at 5435 ft the highest elevation on the trail so far. The train wasn't so bad at this point so I hiked past Standing Indian and Carter Gap shelters and pushed onto Betty Creek Campground. A few hours later the young fellows from Indiana, Keith and Caleb arrived along with another young fellow named Joe. The area had a nice stream flowing through it so I took the opportunity to soak my tired feet. The numbing effect of the water was refreshing. Still trying to maintain and manage the pain in my feet. My knees ache but not as much as my feet.","Muskrat Creek shelter

Worn Miles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588468,"climbed steadily out of Betty Creek for a couple hours before reaching the base of Albert Mountain. From here the hike became almost vertical. I hiked hand-over-hand over boulders for about a quarter mile which was extremely difficult with a 29 pound pack. But it was all worth it once I reached Albert Mountain fire tower, elevation 5250 ft. It was clear out and the view magnificent. It was also chilly and very windy. Pushed onto Winding Stair Gap on a steep 3 Mile downhill hike. My feet are on fire. Blisters on toes are very painful. Shuttle driver Jim met us at Winding Stair Gap and drove us 10 miles into Franklin.","Betty Creek campground

Worn Miles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588918,"I walked around with my pack and the new shoes purchased at Outdoor 76 and found no relief. The experts are suggesting that I am suffering from some type of neuroma in the balls of my feet. I've managed the blisters on my toes well and are not an issue except that I swear my 2nd left toe is broken. I've kicked more than my share or rocks and roots. I can barely touch the tip of it and the rest of it is numb. That continues to be an issue even when I tape it up. Hard to get an even stride while hiking. I Don't understand the neuroma problem. My Keene's have a wide toe box and my laces aren't overly tight. Looks like I'll be section hiking from now on.All said, these 13 days were a great experience. I met some fantastic hikers of all ages and backgrounds. Hiking solo all day puts your mind in a different place. Just hearing the sounds of the forest and your own breathing is totaling relaxing but invigorating. I miss it already but I'll be back.Many, many thanks to my friends Rick and Laurie in WV who came to get me in Front Royal  and let me chill at their house until the weekend when Deb comes to pick me up and return me to reality.Warren",,View Entry,"May 01, Tue",0
Worn Miles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593310,Back on the trail from my foot r&r. Many thanks to Rick and Laurie for putting me up for a week. Caught up with the Franklin crew at the HoJo. They decided to take a zero day due to Blair hashing his head diving into the hotel pool.The trail today is fairly easy but I lost my trail legs during my r&r so I kept it to 11 miles. The Rhododendrems are in full bloom and the white and pink flowers are spectacular. Great hiking today. Great to be back on the trail.Worn Miles,"Daleville, VA

Worn Miles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605953,Except for that steep switchback this morning the trail was fairly tame. Something spooked a deer that looked to be the size of a thorobred horse with at least 10 points. It jumped over the trail about 200 feet in front of me. Definitely the largest forest animal I've seen so far and I hope it stays that way! Heading to the Middle Creek campground for the night. I have a mail drop waiting though I dont think I need it just yet. I will kick it up the trail. No need to carry 7 days of food.,"

Worn Miles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605954,"Made it to Middle creek rd after a 2 mile downhill switchback hell. Called the campground for a pickup and was promised a 15 minute wait. After  a half hour I hoisted the pack and road walked a mile uphill to the campground. Got an apology for the lapse the act down and enjoyed a bacon cheeseburger. Shared a cabin with Pace, whom I was expecting via Blairs texts. Settled in and headed to the pool for a refreshing dip/soap free bath.Got a ride to the trailhead and Pace and I were back on the trail at 0940.Took a break for lunch around 1 and Blair, Mike, Dave and Tim caught up. We were going to meet Tim's friend at Apple Orchard mountain. Pace pushed ahead of me and was soon out of sight. I started feeling a pain in my lower left abdominal area reminiscent of the Ishemic Colitis pain I experienced back in '08 when I was first diagnosed with lupus. Not serious pain but enough to think about.I decided to stop at Cornelius Creek shelter for a privy break but stayed too long. I pitched my tent behind the shelter and continued to feel those pains. The thunder storms that night were unreal. Didn't sleep well as a result.After breakfast while packing up I heard nearby traffic so I checked out my map and saw that I was close by the Blue Ridge Parkway. I was refusing to leave the trail at the same time I was planning my escape. As I hiked, I kept checking for a cell signal, finally getting one at a rock outcrop. Got a shuttle at a BRP rest stop by an Englishman over to Lexington. There, Kay's friend and his wife picked me up and took me to Winchester. From there I stayed at Rick's in Great Cacapon before heading back to Point Pleasant.","
