Researching the start times and seeing thata lot of flip-flop hikes begin in Harper's Ferry WV about the beginning of May it made sense for us to switch tothat style of Thru hike.

I feel blessed to be with my Son doing these things, and am excitedto meet with God out there and see what happens. Fears yes of course, but with a supporting wife and home teamhow can we lose.

German Shepherd,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588659,"Only slept about 2 hours last night.  Exhausted! Ground was rock hard. Son slept fitfully, too. Hoping it will get better and recalling the book Hiking Thru, which described the first 2 weeks being hard to sleep.  Hit the trail at 6:45 a.m., leaving West Virginia, on into Maryland that will stretch about 41 miles.  Put on about 14.8 miles in the scorching sun that was probably pushing 80 degrees.  Leaves are not on the trees yet so really gave us a direct hit from the sun.   Too hot for me.  Hilly, rocky terrain.  TOUGH day!  Glad it’s over.  Two small blisters for me.  (Wanted to quit.   Tried to get a shuttle to town but no one could come.)  Eager to leave behind the sweat from Maryland & W. Virginia and cross into Pennsylvania tomorrow afternoon.  Projected 83 degrees tomorrow and 86 the day after so we’ll take a zero that day to stay out of heat -- put feet up and watch a baseball game.  Learned of others planning to rent rooms in Waynesburough, too.  Son is our lead dog.  Let me tell you, when he says, “Mush!”  I hike!  Problem is he has this old dog on his team, who has spent too much time by his bowl.  Met up with Sugarfoot, check out his blog .:-)  You know, they talk about how many steps you take on the AT. Another question I’d add is, “How many beads of sweat are shed?”  or “How many negative thoughts come into your head that you have to rebuke?”  Just questions you think about as you take each of the 5 million steps.","20 miles north of Harper’s Ferry WV

German Shepherd,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588812,"We praise God for a safe arrival through some HOT but sunny weather. 87 in the shade and 100 in the sun.  I was amazed at how much we drank yet the need to go number 1 stopped.  Lesson learned: drink way more than 2-3 liters in hot weather!  
Knowing the forecast, we left early at 6 a.m. and ended at 2 pm.  Met up two whitetail deer as we crossed a field from 200 yards and were pleasantly surprised that they stayed there.  
We also met another father/son duo, Mud & Strider, on the trail who remind us of ourselves. Then later discovered they were staying at the same hotel!
As we came out on a road near the Mason/Dixon Line (Maryland/Pennsylvania), there was a parking lot with a couple cars, people visiting, and two German Shepherds sitting. David walked by and not a bark out of them.  Then I came, and WOW! Or make that ""BOW WOW!!!"" -- Did they let me have it!
I told them I really don’t have any drugs, which brought out a laugh and smile.  One dog was a 3 year old.  Made me think of our 7 year old Daisy-doo, who starts to lag after a 4 mile walk back home.  No way could she have handled this.
The final stretch of the day was climbing a brutal small mountain.  After that David asked, ""Now what do we do?""  I explained how I'd read that folks in these parts are accustomed to seeing hikers and helping them.  So I went up on the road and stuck out my thumb.  ZOOM, Zoom, zoom...... etc.  I was ready to lay down on the side of the road and play dead as could not imagine standing there for possibly an hour in this heat!  David decided it was time to get a shuttle so we called the hotel who put us in touch with their driver, Roger.  My phone had only 1 bar plus couldn't hear Roger as he said he was outside with the chickens and would call us back.  All we could do was wait and hope.  He called shortly and his wife drove up in a gray Hyundai about 10 min. later.  She only charged us $7 for the 7 mi. ride.  We gave her $10... how could she make anything?
Ate at Waynesburgers Restaurant - cool 50's type diner with plenty of vegan options as well.  Satisfying Mediterranean meals for us both but ordered David a chocolate malt.  We will resupply now, clean up, while hopefully it will cool down some.","Maine flop to Georgia end from Harper’s Ferry WV

German Shepherd,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588969,"David and I enjoyed a good rest day and as did some of the fellow flip-flop hikers with whom we visited during breakfast today at the motel, including Mud & Stryder and Atticus, who greeted us kindly.  We hadn't seen each other since the kickoff. We exchanged our first battle stories with Steady, a pleasant gal named by Mud, who stated she is ""steady"".  We talked of blisters and other foot ailments and gear and methods.  Stryker has an ingrown toe nail. The athletic tape on the hot spots on David's heel is working but has a bright sunburn on his legs.  I thank the Lord for these hikers who are sources of real encouragement!
We hiked 2.5 miles (that seemed like nothing) to the big grocery store that reminded me of a HyVee with its gigantic salad bar that we found very enjoyable.  We picked up supplies and re-packed, getting rid of some of the bags of food we'd packed from home that we realize now we don't need.  Packs are definitely lighter!  David needs to eat more so he'll carry more.  He is learning the need to not just take a sip of water but really drink more along the way.
We'll start again first thing tomorrow about 6:00 a.m., by taking a shuttle to the AT.  Going on 16 then north to our next resupply at Boiling Springs, PA, which is about 54.5 miles. Goal is Boiling Springs, PA, by Sunday night.  Rain in forecast then. Excited!  Rested now and energy restored so can’t wait to see more of this trail and spend time with my son while also getting to know new trail mates. 
Also want to thank my wife, Lee, for her encouragement.  Also Bob & Nancy, Tim, and many other supportive people -- you've been great!  Your prayers have gotten us through the tough stuff at the outset!  I am all the more aware of how we so cannot do this without the good Lord's helping hands.","Appalachian Trail

German Shepherd,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589106,"At 6:00 a.m. we waited in line for the Continental breakfast.  As I took in my first mouthful of Raisen Bran, in walks a thin gent in silk shorts, tie, and straw fedora hat, who queries, ""Does anyone know hikers named Bob and David?""  We said, “Yes, sir, we will be right with you.  He said, “Eat up,boys, day light is burnin and adventures await you!” “Naw,” he said, “I’ll be out in the car.”  Roger was a gracious fellow who enjoys doing his lift service with wife, Francis.  
We hit the trail at 6:36 a.m. with a goal of water at a spring in Old Forge Picnic Area.  When we arrived, a sign on a building read, “Year-Round springs flow from a pipe.""  But it was dry.  So, we saw a building with a parking lot and thought it must be there.  As we began to walk, a gentleman leads out and asked, “You lost?”  We tell him we guess so as can’t find the water.  He directs us to go to the next shelter about a mile on that has a good stream there.
Yes, we were lost but not anymore.  Found Tumbling Run shelters and a Katz-look-a-like who greets us with, “Glad to meet you.  My name is I Don’t Care. I’ve been here since yesterday afternoon.  You’ll see there is a big hill up ahead and, you guessed it, I don’t care to climb it.” We laughed!
Felt good to put feet up and eat fresh fruits from the first day on the trail.  Must get rid of it and pack right, you know.  We went on and about 16 miles decided to soak our feet in a clear, cool, fast flowing stream.  Up walks a hiker we recognize from Day 1 who had hike it half way last year before throwing in the towel but back again.  We call him Anchorage.  He says, “Hi Guys!  Where you headed?”  We told him, “North.”  He said, “Nice shelter up ahead but big hill before it.”  We thanked him for the intel.  He said he was slack packing (day packing) and had been dropped ahead and would be picked up for lodging that night.  
We trudged on, chins up, facing a steep ascent of about a 1,000 feet in 3 miles.  We reached the shelter, out of gas.  The phone mileage app read 19.5 miles.  It was around 4 p.m., so we lit the ever-new, alcohol heet burner stove and ate beef stroganoff by the stream.
“Should we go on?” we asked ourselves.  

The answer was, “WWRD?” = What would Ray do? 

Ray is a textbook author on lightweight backpacking whom we use as our mentor. Neither David nor I have ever distance packed anywhere! So, we trust Ray Jardine’s advice. He described a hiking method called “pyramid hiking”that describes eating the big evening meal earlier (around 4 p.m.) and then hike more before settling in just before dark.  David and I agreed to do it that way and go on after having been energized by the food.  We set up camp later when we find spring water about 5.5. miles up the trail.  
Thanks to Ray’s Way, we put in a 25-mile hike and rested peacefully to the sounds of children playing at dusk.   
This must be our style.  We go out and give her and then rest.  They say that everyone has to ""walk their own hike"".  Everyone is different.  This pyramid style works for us, plus by building in a reward system, knowing there’s a nice place up ahead waiting just for us -- keeping that goal ahead -- we can go out and eat up miles! We’ve already chewed up 5% of the trail! 
Pretty happy. No cell service from the campsite that night.","Waynesboro, PA

German Shepherd,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589143,"We rose at about 6 a.m. Pleased to discover there was no rain on the trail. We packed and hit it in about 20 minutes.  (We’re getting this down now.)  Unfortunately, feet swelling, two new blisters from that long hike yesterday.  I paid for it this day.  The cooler weather was welcome!  Flatter trails made for less stress hiking.  Already had 8 miles in by 9 a.m.!
We came upon a 3 mile stretch of managed-burn forest which aid regrowth and stopped about 10:30 a.m. for some power mush and foot care at Tom’s Run shelter next to a nice stream. Some thru-hikers sped by on their strong legs, sporting attitudes from making it half way to Maine from Georgia.  Inspiring! We thought then maybe the Lord will strengthen our weak bodies, too.  We have revived faith that He can! So, we continue on to our next water stop at a state park.
Upon arrival to the Appalachian Trail Museum and Conservatory Campground & Museum, we discovered there was a Fundraiser Picnic going on!  We looked through the museum viewing the lore and articles used by famous gone-befores like Grandma Gatewood and Earl Shaffer including his 1948 boots and cook pans.  
Then we experienced trail magic!  They greeted us and inquired if we were Thru's and then invited us to go over and eat (for free to thru hikers!)  Enjoyed the bluegrass band while dining on burgers, salad, and cool drinks.  I don’t think a plain burger ever tasted so good! What a gorgeous park and ATC facilities! 
We recognized a photographer from the Flip Flop event last weekend.  He commented, “Wow!  You’ve made it this far!”  

I replied, “Ya, but why didn’t anyone tell us there were hills to climb!”  

He said, “What part of the Appalchian Mt Trail didn’t you get?  Most folks read a little before hiking.”  

With body and spirit encouraged, we are thankful to our God who cares for each one, even some Minnesota men who are far from their northwood's home.  
We climb on for the rest of the day and pick our way through the rocky paths, lost in thought and meditation.  We need water soon, but where and when should we eat?  Nothing promising to our likes.  Yet we hike on past 5 p.m. , then 6, then 7!  We realized we were becoming tired, so finally found a quiet stream and pitched the tarp as rain sprinkled down.  We dined on instant potatoes while a light rain fell and asked the phone, “How far?”  It replied, “25.4 miles.”  Our furthest so far.  Ended the day tired but happy.","25 miles north of Waynesboro

German Shepherd,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589354,"Anticipated the day to hold a short hike into Boiling Springs, but it turned out to be not 3 but 10 miles!  Somehow read the map wrong and missed the part about the steepness, too! That resulted in two new, bad blisters between the toes.
The simple hotel where we're sleeping tonight is a 1700’s inn called Mt. Holly Spring Inn that started out as a shack then became a tavern in 1804, that is situated in a gap between Mt. Holly Springs.  The hotel shuttle is a big, old white Cadillac driven by a 60 something retired nurse now owner wearing one thin braid down the side of her head.  Friendly with interesting historical stories.
Enjoyed Strombolli’s pizza for lunch and then rested and made calls and worked on the blogs.  Drafted my journal entries on white paper plates. No energy and feet hurt too badly to trek down the hall to the office for real paper.  Guess that’s when you tell your boy to go down and get it, but I know he’s hurting, too.  
David had to cut my thumbnail-sized blisters using the tiny scissors gadget on the jack knife.  With this surgery under his belt, I've christened his trail name, Dr. D.
Dr. D also has hurts including a big, new bruise on his shin.  Fell on a rock maze and yelled as he slid into solid rock. We're going as fast as we can safely but that was not slow enough, I guess.  This ""hiking"" is tougher than we ever imagined
Ate here at the Holly Inn for dinner, where we witnessed Dr. D's first ever Open Mike event. (Kenny Hurlbut would've fit right in here!)  Liked the mando performance but was painful to watch another guy who couldn't carry a tune.  
Dr. D. noted that we are out of snacks.  He observed that Hersheys melt before noon but Snickers last.  Have to resupply at Dollar General tomorrow.","9.3 miles south of Boiling Springs

German Shepherd,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589445,"Dr. D and I enjoyed a peaceful night's rest after a late ball game on the television.  We ate a simple breakfast of fruit and pastry.  We bought a Second Skin Blister Repair product from a pharmacy and then down to Family Dollar Store to resupply our packs with food for the next 75 miles to Bethel, PA.  We like the name of that town, means in Hebrew ""House of God"" and sounds like a good place to rest next.
Highlight today was visiting the Amelia S. Givin Free Library. Very Interesting in an historic building with unique craftsman woodwork. Wrap around ladder to access tall book shelves.
We have an appointment at 6:30 a.m. with Cindy, who manages the Holly Inn, to take us back to Boiling Springs, PA, where we'll pick up the AT again.  So for now we'll get some sleep and watch our Minnesota Twins on Monday Night baseball!

German Shepherd,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589784,"We hit the trail by walking across the river bridge, ascending into a steep climb to hills above Duncannon.   We meandered through the flat rocky pathway until we met two mean with slack packs.  We'd seen them the day before.  As a matter of fact, this was the third time we'd run into the one guy.  He said he prefers to slack pack when he can find a way to do it.  Our next encounter was a with a group of children from Montgomery School District along with their teachers and some parents.  The students in grades 2-8 had earned a one day field trip by excelling in reading. We were blessed with an invitation to trail magic, when we reached their park point.  Our feet moved much quicker when we knew we would find a treat!  There to greet us was a cooler filled with cold gatorade and snickers bars that were very tasty and refreshing on that sunny day!  We met up with the other half of the student group at the shelter about 3 miles further.  This time we visited with their teacher, who completed a section hike during 2004-2009.  Very nice bunch!  When leaving, Dr. D said, ""You know, that blue trail to Biffy will cut us back onto the trail quicker.  I replied by pushing past him, commanding him to get out of my way, (You, blue-blazer (short cutter)!""  Dr. D took the lead again, as always, but halted suddenly!  I bellowed, ""What's wrong?""He yelled, ""Snake!""I said, ""Where?""He pointed on the trail straight ahead.  I grabbed a rock and tossed it at the 6 foot long, black monster.  He obliged us with a quick exit right.  Exciting!  Our first trail snake!  We hiked on and on and on...As we began the descent, we found a cold spring.  The mileage read 18.8; we needed a rest!  David gulped water as we cooked Chicken Alfredo.  We were then joined by two North Bounders from Springer Mountain, GA, Thirteen and Wobbly.  Friendly 20 somethings who asked if we were camping right there on the trail.  We weren't as it was only 5 p.m. but had hit a wall and decided to dine.  They left.  We followed in their footsteps at 6 p.m., to climb yet another rise before bedtime.  We made it to some pines at the top with a nice breeze and slept there for the night.  A great day!  Amen.","Duncannon

German Shepherd,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589921,"Interesting night sleep last night.  We picked a nice spot in the pines with a breeze whistling through the needles.  The first interruption came about midnight:  the loud sound of an enormous crash.  I shot bolt up right, dragging with me clothes, blankets, bag -- everything in the process.  The sound had been from a huge branch breaking, and I knew that sucker was coming down.  

David also sat up and asked , “What’s wrong?”  I said, “A branch broke.” He said, “Oh,” rolled over and went back to sleep.  About an hour later, I heard some really weird animal sounds.  No, it wasn’t an owl, but “who” knows what it was?  David asked again, “What was that?”  Then again, rolled over and went back to sleep.  
The alarm chimed at 5 a.m,. and we were onto the trail by 6 a.m.  We passed the hikers, Thirteen and Wobbly, who were rising from their camp that had been situated near us.  An hour later those experienced folks flew by us, never to be seen again that day….
We donned our umbrellas when it started raining about 10-11 miles south of Pine Grove, pausing at an old iron bridge. (Seems everything “old” is historic out here.).  We called Comfort Inn to book a room for two nights and asked about a shuttle.  She directed us to call Carl’s Shuttle Service, who said they could be over in two hours.  Yes, TWO hours!  
That long wait was a problem plus there’s no hitch hiking allowed on an interstate.  So, I looked at Dr. D and asked the first of my standard questions: 1.  “What time is it?”  He said, “12:30 p.m.”  I asked #2: “How many miles have we hiked?” He replied, “13.2 miles.”  I teased him with, “You game to hike to the closest Pine Grove exit about 10-11 miles further?  He agreed, and I said, “OK, let’s boogie!”  
Off we went.  Shortly we discovered there is a steep climb up from the gap!  About half way up, sweat was steadily running down my face forming droplets.  I panted for a rest.  As I looked up, there was David standing with the phone in hand, calling for me to answer it as it was the shuttle operator.  I somehow managed to grunt out, “Let it ring!”  They called again and I grunted the same response.   
Well, we made our crossroads for Pine Grove about 5 p.m., which had been a good pace largely because it was only half rocks -- a treat for a change.  I suggested we hitch a ride into town.  The first couple cars slowed as I waved them down, then accelerated when they realized we were seeking a hitch.  The driver of the third car was a cost accountant for an organic chicken business, and he hit the brakes.  He gave us a pleasant ride straight to the hotel.  We praise the Lord for this kind man!  I tried to give him cash, but he refused, saying he likes to help people.  
 So, we cleaned up and slept at the hotel.  It is always good to comfortably catch up with Lee on the phone.","

We both decided that we were giving up too much being on the trail.We missed our loved ones , church family, friends, and our Minnesota Northwood's lake home. We hikedabout 250 miles and met some very nice people, but the long days on the trail, limited views, and difficultterrain became dull to us. So we hitched a ride to Allentown and flew back to Duluth, MN, and rented a car to drive home.We were greeted by tears of joy by my SURPRISED wife! How fortunate we are to havethese wonderful folks in our lives on a regular basis.",,View Entry,"May 21, Mon",0
