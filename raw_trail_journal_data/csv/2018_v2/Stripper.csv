Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580373,"It's always good to set back and reflect from time to time.  I have been so very blessed.  I have had so many people come into my life--some not so good, but others really made an impact.  The ones that have not been so good still had an impact and I learned much from them as well, but the ones that have helped me change to become the person I am today, I call friend.  I am looking forward to this journey of reflective contemplation and to know that I will meet new people that will influence my life each mile I'm on the AT.",,View Entry,"Nov 01, Wed",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580392,I am extremely humbled and blessed by the depth of love my husband has to allow me the opportunity to fulfill my dream of a thru-hike.  I cannot begin to tell you what an amazing man he is and I love him like no other.,,View Entry,"Nov 02, Thu",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580372,"I am extremely excited to even be able to discuss doing a thru-hike, let alone actually prepare for one!  I have lost 100 pounds in a year, thanks to Dr. Ditslear and his awesome team!  I had bariatric surgery December 20, 2016 and I have not regretted it for one minute.  My body was a mess and I was so overweight.  It was nearly impossible for me to hike due to pain in my knees.  But, I no longer have the knee pain, I'm off all medications for diabetes and my body is now in really good condition. NOW is the time.  I'm so blessed to have a network of family and friends to help me see my dream come to reality!",,View Entry,"Nov 08, Wed",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580371,"My new backpack and sleeping bag will be delivered sometime tomorrow.  I have decided to go back to an Osprey pack.  I've carried one before and liked having a ""brain"" so, I'm going back to an Osprey.  I also am going with a Nemo tent, sleeping bag, and air mattress.  That takes my pack weight to right around 6lbs so far.  This will be the lightest I've ever been.",,View Entry,"Nov 09, Thu",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580540,"I have received most of my new gear and am really excited.  I have the schedule put together and I am so ready to get going!  It's gonna be hard to leave the grandbabies and my husband, but I have dreamed about this nearly all my life and now it is becoming a reality.  I will add drops and gear in the near future, but for now I am just so very thankful I am able to have the support to be able to do this!",,View Entry,"Nov 14, Tue",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580832,"We had an amazingly quiet Thanksgiving at our house this year.  A couple of weeks ago we had Thanksgiving with most of the kids.  Our daughter-in-law Joy was being deployed so all of the kids, with the exception of my son who lives in Pennsylvania and has a newborn, here for dinner.  So, it was only me, my husband, his son Eric and my mom here for dinner.  It was very nice and very laidback. We had the traditional turkey, but not everything that went with it.  We had asparagus, stuffing, sweet potato casserole, German potato salad, and butternut squash with cranberries and pears.  Oh and rolls--but that was pretty much it.  It was delicious and we still have leftovers!  I just got a GoPro to take with us this summer and I'm excited to be using it.  I think we will get some interesting shots with it, especially when going up and down some of the boulder scrambles.  I'm gonna make Free Gear carry it and get the shots.  I may do some shots, but we'll see.  I told my students today that I am so ready to hike.  I still have so much to do.  I haven't definitively decided on a pack yet and I don't have all of the food ready yet, but hiking is all I think about.  I have to wait 168 days and then I will be off!",,View Entry,"Nov 27, Mon",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581096,"I will be moving my trail journal to ""The Trek.co"" soon.  I was invited to be one of the bloggers for the 2018 hiking year.  As a result, I will have to shut down this journal, so make sure you look for me there!",,View Entry,"Dec 08, Fri",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581135,"I realized that I can keep both of my journals, the one here and the one on The Trek; however, I probably will not update this one as often.  Once I begin hiking it would be hard to keep up with both because of internet restrictions, as well as time constraints.  I will do my best though.I am right in the middle of final semester grading.  I have to take a break every now and then or my mind goes crazy!  I have amazing students, but seeing mistakes from their rough drafts makes me insane!  So, when that happens, I escape to the AT hiking world.  I am pretty much set, I think, with the exception of food.  I will begin to work on that after the new year.  I don't want to start too early because I don't want things to get stale or go bad.  I will be using mylar stand up bags again for my dinners and will be heat sealing them for freshness.  They have worked well in the past and hold up well in the mail.  This year; however, I am not only doing my food, but also the food for my hiking partner Free Gear.  He is a young man and eats a ton, so it will be a bit trickier to get all of that completed, but I think it will work out.Only one more semester, then off to the thru.  I cannot wait and have begun the countdown--Only 153 more days!",,View Entry,"Dec 12, Tue",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581574,"Another Christmas is in the books for the Freeman household.  We had a wonderful time of fellowship, food, and fun at the house. Our children are spread out over the world, one of Jon's sons is keeping the home fires burning for his wife as she is deployed, my son is in Pennsylvania with his wife and my two granddaughters, we have my daughter, husband and grandson in-state but still about an hour away and then only one close to us. We were able to chat with some, or get together with others and I'm planning on going to PA next week in order to spend some time with those grand babies.  Often I wish the kids were closer, but I know they are where they need to be and are doing what they are called to do.  I got some extremely thoughtful gifts this year.  Something as simple as carabiners to attach my new solar charger to my pack may seem insignificant, but I desperately needed them!  One of my favorite gifts was my moose slippers my husband bought me from LL Bean.  I didn't have anything to keep my feet warm when I am at home and they are perfect!  And cute!  I am looking forward to the new semester with my students.  It looks like I will have about 75 students in 3 classes.  I will be teaching an honors English course for the first time and I'm sure those students will keep me on my toes!  I will not be teaching any remedial classes for the first time and I'm kind of sad about that.  I love teaching those students because when they finally ""get it"" you know they understand and are really proud of themselves.  But, I'm sure I will have some students that still struggle and will make great strides in the classroom. I have been working on food preparation the past couple of days.  After having bariatric surgery, my dietary needs have changed tremendously and I have to really work to get all of the nutrition I need in order to hike.  First off, I'm on a high protein, low carb diet, which is very difficult to do while hiking.  Secondly, I can eat only about 8 oz at any given time.  Last summer when I hiked I was eating about 60-70 grams of protein a day, but only eating about 700 calories. I had many conversations with my dietician and doctor about the lack of calories, but they assured me I would be fine. It was a bit scary to think about at the time, but I did well. I did end up adding a bit more carbs in the morning, then I ate a small meal every two hours while I was hiking.  I had a hearty soup for dinner that was higher in protein than carbs, and I didn't lose a ton of weight.  This summer, I really don't have much more to lose, maybe some lingering belly fat, but I'm down to 155 and that seems to be a good weight for me.  I've been right around that weight for nearly 3 months.  Only 138 days or so until I'm off hiking and I cannot wait!  It is going to be an amazing journey!",,View Entry,"Dec 27, Wed",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582956,"I cannot think of a more appropriate day than Valentine's Day to take the time to thank my wonderful husband, Jon, for allowing me the time to chase my dream of thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail.  He is amazingly supportive and willing to do whatever I need to make my dreams come true.  There are not many men who would want their wife to spend 6 months out in the woods and away from him.  I know he loves me and I cannot even begin to adequately express the love that I feel for him.  
I am getting close to having my gear dialed in.  I set up the tent the other day and made sure I could get my sleeping mat blown up and my bed made while sitting in the tent.  It was tight, but it worked.  I am sure that with much practice, I will get better at it.  I plan on staying in my tent more than staying in shelters.  I do not like mice and I don't want them running over me all night.  
I am extremely excited to hit the trail!  I realized that yesterday we are just 90 days away from our start!  
It's beginning to sink in--I am going to thru-hike the AT!
I still have so many things to do.  I haven't gotten all of the mail drops completed just yet, so I have to do all of that yet, but other than food, I think we're good to go.  I know Nigel is excited and is having a hard time concentrating on his last semester of college.  I need to go grade essays now and be in the real world for a while!",,View Entry,"Feb 14, Wed",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583381,"Nigel and I are 76 days away from beginning our hike and he is having some serious knee problems.  He is hoping to have an MRI sometime this week to see what the problem might be.  He is struggling with the possibility of not being able to hike.  I am just praying he will be good to go; after all, football players can have knee surgery and be playing within 6 weeks.  We are earnestly praying that whatever the problem is--that it can be fixed quickly and it will not affect his hike.  Meanwhile, I am still working on food drops and getting last minute gear.  Which, we don't need much more of either!  My dining room is getting full of drop boxes all taped up and ready to go!  I have a trip to Pennsylvania this coming weekend to watch the grand daughters for the weekend while my son and daughter-in-law go to their marriage retreat.  Then the following week my husband and I will be taking my mom to Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon.  These are places she has always wanted to go, but was never able to before.  My mom is not a good traveler at age 77, everything scares her.  But seeing the Grand Canyon is outweighing her fears at the moment.  Don't get me wrong--I cannot wait to see it either!  I have flown over it, but I have never actually stood on the rim and looked at the glory of God's handiwork; and I cannot wait!  Then 3 weeks after that Jon and I will be in Wisconsin for a weekend for a baby shower, then just 4 weeks later, I hit the trail!   Whewww--makes me tired thinking of all I have to do!  And while all of those trips are planned and while I'm finishing up food drops, I am still working and grading students' work.  Currently, I have 25 rough drafts sitting on my desk and 25 portfolios that need grading.  So, I am busy, to say the least.  It's gonna be a crazy 76 days!",,View Entry,"Feb 27, Tue",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585028,"Six weeks....just 49 more days until I leave for the AT.  I will get to spend a week with my sweet grandbabies and son and daughter-in-law before I actually put my feet on the AT, but I will be officially out of town in just 6 weeks.  I am excited, and yet the nerves are still ever present.  I'm old--not soooo old, but I have an old and feeble body.  It is always in the back of my head that the osteoarthritis will get the best of me, the my knees will not take the pressure, that I will fall and injure myself.  I guess those concerns will have me listening to my body and will help me to recognize when I need to slow down or when I need to take a day off.  I woke up to rain this morning and while I don't mind hiking in the mist, I hate hiking in the rain.  I wondered to myself what I would do when it rains on the trail...Would I try to talk Chilli into a rain day?  I am betting I would.  But, I wouldn't be able to do that often as we have to finish by a certain date because my husband and I are planning a cruise to celebrate my finish.  I do not want to miss that cruise!  There are many things about hiking I love...the friends, the views, the accomplishment of every day that I am able to hike the miles I want, completing that daily goal; conversely, there are many things about hiking that I hate, rain is one.  To be honest, rain and cold.  I do not like either.  And, if those two things wake me up in the morning, then I am not a nice person.  I know in my head that I must hike, but I will not be happy about it at all.  I have planned on a schedule so we can actually complete our hike and be able to have some time off.  So, I am hopeful and confident that I will be able to actually complete this hike and finish it well.",,View Entry,"Mar 27, Tue",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600359,"I know it has been a very long time since I’ve updated the journal, but Chilli and I are closing in on 1,000 miles. It’s been a long journey, but we should be standing on Katahdin within 2 weeks and then on August 30th we will fly back to Baltimore, MD where my husband will pick us up. After spending a long weekend with him and having a small family reunion of a couple of his brothers and sisters we will begin walking south. It will be the fourth time I will have walked this section; however it will be the first time walking southbound and I’m afraid it is going to mess with my mind so much!  I am so accustomed to east being to my right that I’m sure I’m gonna get turned around a few times heading into a town!The hike this year has been amazing!  I have met so many amazing and wonderful people that I’m sure will be life-long friends for sure!  I met up with three women, Wild Eagle, River, and Puddles and we called ourselves “The  Decrepits” because we were all over the age of 50!  Then Puddles and River met up with another woman who was 71 and she was kicking their butts through the Mahoosuc Notch!  There are some amazing older women out in the trail this year, for sure!!  It’s empowering to say the least!  I was finally able to crawl, climb and scrape my way through the Mahoosuc Notch this year!  In 2012 bad weather forced me around it. In 2015 I ended up hiking out before it to have my sternum X-rayed because of a fall (I separated my ribs from the sternum) so I was determined to get through it this time!  I’m also just as determined to climb Katahdin this year!  It WILL happen, Lord willing!  I’m so ready to just get it done.","
