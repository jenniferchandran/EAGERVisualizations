Dogwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597880,"Working on my gear selection and tentative plans for the first couple days on the trail.  I am definitely going to go with the hammock set-up and will be ordering the underquilt, bugnet and undersling this week.  Hope to also pull the trigger on my backpack in the next couple days.",,View Entry,"Jul 22, Sun",0
Dogwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599103,"Pulled the trigger on my backpack.  I decided to go with the Osprey Aether AG 60.  Went to the REI in Madison and got sized and then walked around the store for about 20 minutes with 30 pounds loaded.  Felt good so I ordered it in green, they only had burnt orange available in the store.  Also picked up a hydration system for it and a pack cover.  The pack weighs in a bit heavier than the other packs I was considering but I really liked the detachable day pack feature. My next purchases will be made soon to fill out my sleeping gear. Going to do a bit more research before I make the final decision.",,View Entry,"Aug 02, Thu",0
Dogwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599110,"The REI boxes keep showing up on the doorstep.  I finished my research and finalized my hammock related gear.  One of the tougher choices was which bug net to get.  I was stuck between two ENO products, the Guardian and the Guardian DX.  My biggest concern was that the Guardian DX is a new offering and I could not find one review anywhere!  I decided on the DX even though it was $15 more expensive based on a few things.  First,  it has a spreader bar which keeps the net further above the hammock, and my face.  Secondly, the guy wire system is integrated into the netting which is one less thing to have to tie/hang.  Also, the dual openings seem to be well located and are a nice feature.  Size was the same as the Guardian so that wasn't a factor, but it comes in 3 ozs. lighter for a final bonus.  I have had a ENO doublenest hammock for 3 years with the atlas strap system.  Originally I was going to go with those but ended up upgrading to the Supersub model with the Helios suspension system.  That dropped my gear weight by a pound.  I also added the Vulcan underquilt and underbelly gear sling.  I will use my existing Lafuma Patrouille Light bag as my top quilt.  Making progress!",,View Entry,"Aug 02, Thu",0
Dogwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599478,"Gear acquisition continues!  Ordered compression/dry sacs and trekking poles today.  Also, ordered some accessories for my Solo Stove to make it easier to use and more versatile.  Also, I have been gathering my existing clothing that I will use on the trail to make sure it is in good shape and suitable for the section hike.  A little over a month to go.  Time to start specifically training for the hike.  I haven't been overly concerned about training up to this point primarily because of a heavy golf schedule with leagues and the club championship taking center stage.  Also, I figure since I am going to be section hiking with no specific end point required that my pace will be my pace, not planning on trying to push for big daily numbers.  30 days of daily hiking prior will hopefully improve my conditioning a bit.",,View Entry,"Aug 06, Mon",0
Dogwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602856,"My starting point (on the TN side of the TN/VA border) and first 2 overnights stops have been overcome by events (OBE).  See below!
""An area of the Mount Rogers National Recreation high country and the Appalachian Trail have been temporarily closed due to heightened black bear activity and human encounters with black bears. USDA Forest Service officials at the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests announced the closure this afternoon. This camping closure affects approximately 20,000 acres of National Forest System lands in Grayson and Smyth counties, including Elk Garden, Thomas Knob Shelter, the Scales, Old Orchard Shelter, and approximately 17 miles of the Appalachian Trail (Forest Trail #1). The segment of the Appalachian Trail affected is between VA-600 at Elk Garden and VA-603 at Fox Creek.""
In response to this I modified my plans to focus my section hike on the area east and west of Roanoke VA. I found the website of the Roanoke Appalachian Trail Club.  They maintain over 100 miles of the AT and have awesome online resources.  Now a lady named Florence is going to drop 5+ inches of rain and once again I am OBE.  See below!
