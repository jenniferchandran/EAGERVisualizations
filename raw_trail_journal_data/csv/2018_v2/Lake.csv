Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593580,"Once again I'll be hiking the Appalachian Trail. This year is the 20th and the 10th anniversaries of hiking the AT. It also is the 6th anniversary of hiking the AT as part of the Eastern Continental Trail in 2012. My mix of successful and unsuccessful hikes out west are put on hold for now. 
    The hike this year will be southbound and will either end at Springer Mountain Georgia or Flagg Mountain in Alabama via the Benton Mackaye and Pinhoti Trails. As always, a hike with Lake is not a hike, its an adventure.",,View Entry,"Jun 10, Sun",0

Heartrock  and I will stay with her sister in Portland a few days before heading north to Millinocket on Sunday. After lunch at the Appalachian Trail Café we will venture to Katahdin Stream Campground. Weather looks good to summit Mount Katahdin Monday morning. Then Tuesday I will head out solo and sobo on the AT. The goal for Tuesday is to exit Baxter State Park (no camping on AT within the park), cross the Penobscot River at Abol Bridge, reach the ""100 Mile Wilderness"" and camp.",,View Entry,"Jun 14, Thu",0

      We also took our time hiking around beautiful Fort Wiliams and Portland Head Light. The long rocky beaches took me away. A beautiful weekend in New England. That could be a song.

Heartrock, TIG, and I went into Millinocket and had breakfast at the Appalachian Trail Cafe. 
Afterwards we returned to the park and went for a brief hike around Grassy and Elbow Ponds on mosquito patrolled trails. 
     Around 3pm Heartrock and TIG left and headed home. I was very sad. I did go down a side trail to the road and hitch-hiked as they went by. They stopped and we laughed. I needed one more goodbye. 
      Back at camp I prepared my gear for tomorrow. I tried for over an hour to get the fire going but it would not cooperate. At 6 the rain returned and I settled in for the night.","Katahdin Stream Lean-to, ME

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595134,"Left camp at 8:12 a.m. The day was sunny and windy. The wind was a blessing as it kept the mosquito patrols grounded. 
    Saw only an English fisherman near Big Niagara Falls on Nesowadnehunk Stream on my way to Abol Bridge. 
     I arrived at the store for a brief break and a short time to use paid internet.  A young English hiker was sitting in front of the store with his mosquito netting hat on and warned me to put long sleeves on. I obeyed but after reaching the 100 Mile Wilderness and having more sweat drops than mosquitoes I returned to the sleeveless shirt. 
     It was getting hot so I stopped at the vacant Hurd Shelter about 4:30 p.m. The wind was sweeping through camp keeping the mosquitoes away, to my delight.","Katahdin Stream Lean-to, ME

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595185,"Another breezy day to keep the mosquitoes at bay. Left camp early feeling tired but better as the day wore on. 
Beautiful view of Mount Katahdin from Rainbow Ledges. Later, swam a bit at Rainbow Lake. Just as I got out I heard loons calling. So beautiful! 
After the long hike along the lake I was treated to another awesome view of Katahdin from Rainbow Lake Dam. 
Rainbow Stream Shelter is situated in a small gorge between ponds in perhaps the most beautiful location along the trail. A Nobo hiker went by just before the bridge crossing to the shelter. A Sobo was in the shelter in his tent and according to his trail register entry having a difficult time already. 
A nice hike down Rainbow Stream Gorge then a steep, hot hike up to Crescent Pond. A fisherman in a boat waved as I went by. I saw a Nobo down by the water. I went to the east side of the lake and jumped in. I pitched my tent up a side red blazed trail. 
A long hot day but feeling better though tired.","Hurd Brook Shelter

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595286,"Rain overnight and a beautiful morning. The thrush were singing as I climbed Nesuntabunt Mountain. At the top was another view of Katahdin. 
Met many Sobos and Nobos. A father and son were finishing up their 13 year quest to do the Appalachian Trail in sections. Hotdog and his 69 year old father C-4 will climb Katahdin in a few days. 
Mosquitoes in places today, even at Lower Jo-Mary Lake. But I was relieved to hit a breeze as I went out the narrow peninsula at Antlers Camp. Surrounded on three sides by water and covered with Red Pines, this beautiful little peninsula has been a favorite camping spot for me I think six times over the years. All I hear are a few waves on the lake and the wind through the pines.","Crescent Pond

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595395,"Cool morning with a beautiful sunrise over Lower Jo-Mary Lake. I didn't want to leave such a pristine campsite. The thrush were singing again as I headed south on the trail. 
Lack of a breeze allowed the mosquitoes to resume their attacks. At Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to I took a long break. Its beautiful location made it hard not to. 
Later took another long break at the rocky outlet of Crawford Lake as I enjoyed the views. 
After Crawford Lake the trail got rocky and the weather was hot. I was happy to arrive at East Branch Shelter and dip into the east branch of Pleasant Stream. 
A thrush is singing its beautiful song above me. Its sweet call reminds me of home.","Antlers Camp on Lower Jo-Mary Lake
","East Branch, Pleasant River","Jun 22, Fri",16
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595504,"Today was one brutal section. I've done this section during three nobo hikes with no problem. But, of course, those times I had a few thousand miles on my legs. Today, with less than a hundred miles on my legs, it really drained me. 
Four peaks that the trail went up one side and down the other steep and rocky. It was a rocky rock and roll trail. Took me from 6:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. After White Cap Mountain kicked my butt I got punched by Hay Mountain, slapped by West Peak, then hit over the head by Gulf Hagas Mountain. 
Great view back from White Cap Mountain towards Katahdin, however. I believe that is the last view I'll have of my old friend. 
30 miles and I'll be out of the 100 Mile Wilderness and then resting and eating in Monson. 
Pushed today because of pending rain. Just as I was wading across the river I noticed rain drops hitting the surface of the water. Went a bit further to the first campsite I found. Got the tent set up and inside as the rain got steadier. So glad to be off my feet.","East Branch, Pleasant River
","West Branch, Pleasant River","Jun 23, Sat",16.80
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595601,"I thought today would be easier than yesterday but it was not to be. The mosquitoes subsided once I got enough altitude while climbing Chairback Mountain. 
But, like yesterday, a lot of steep rock climbing slowed me down. Then there was Columbus Mountain, Third Mountain and Fourth Mountain. I was drained from yesterday so today was slow. 
On Fourth Mountain I could see a storm and its sheets of rain heading my way. I attempted to go as fast as I could to hopefully get to Cloud Pond on Barren Mountain. I already was a few hours behind my estimated time of arrival. 
I arrived at Cloud Pond just as the rain began around 8:30 p.m. Wind began to blow and I was cold. Once in the tent I was grateful to be warm and dry. Thousands of Spring Peepers sang me to sleep as well as the rain on the tent.","West Branch, Pleasant River
","Cloud Pond, ME","Jun 24, Sun",10.80
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595675,"The rain continued into the morning allowing a 2 1/2 hour delay which I was happy about. On the trail I was in the clouds until I began to descend Barren Mountain. Blue lakes and green mountains were in all directions. I sat on the rocks for an hour and made some coffee. 
At the bottom of the mountain along Long Pond Stream someone made ""100"" with rocks signifying 100 miles to (or from) Katahdin. I forded Long Pond Stream with Sweet. Sweet is a sobo and we passed back and forth for a few days now. 
I continued over the mountain and the trail disappeared as it dipped into a new beaver pond. A beaver smacked its tail hard on the water startling me.  It smacked two more times as I bushwacked around his new stinky dam. 
Thunder a few times then rain for an hour. I came to Big Wilson Stream, another ford. 
Again, I seemed not to be making the miles. I thought I'd be at Little Wilson Stream by 7 p.m. but didn't arrive until 8:15 and forded across. I continued uphill but there were no campsites above the 60' high Little Wilson Falls on the trail's side.  I was tired so decided I had to gingerly ford the stream just above the falls to flatter ground. Another tough day but tomorrow is a town stop.","Cloud Pond, ME
",Little Wilson Stream,"Jun 25, Mon",12.50
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595697,"After coffee to warm me up I packed up and forded across Little Wilson Stream. A cold way to start the morning, indeed. 
I left at 6:21 a.m. and pushed forward to Maine Highway 15. 
Not a bad hiking morning as it was cool and a light breeze. The coolness and the breeze however kept me from dipping into one of the ponds to clean up for town. 
I passed numerous Nobos, stomachs full and fresh smelling (most of them) from their town stop in Monson. 
I arrived at the roadway at 11:15 and called Shaw's Hiker Hostel. ""Hippie Chick"" said they'll be right up. Her husband ""Poet"" picked me up. As soon as I said my name he remembered me. The couple hiked the Appalachian Trail the same year as I did, 2008, and we camped together one night somewhere down south. Hiker Chick's parents Navigator and Old Man also were there. Navigator and Old Man own the AT Lodge and the AT Cafe in Millinocket. It was on my way to Maine with Heartrock I read in the AT Companion that Hiker Chick and Poet bought Shaws Hostel. I was amazed they remembered me. 
At the hostel I took a needed shower then headed into town; I needed a burger. 
I stopped at the Lakeshore House and had a good burger and listened to the music from the 70's and 80's. I could have sat outside by the lake but I was tired and enjoying the music. 
My plan was to zero here tomorrow but Thursday heavy rain is expected. I have a few options to consider: I could head out tomorrow, I could slack pack tomorrow or I could zero two days. I'll have to sleep on this one.","Little Wilson Stream
","Monson, ME","Jun 26, Tue",6.60
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595727,"Slacker! 
While not wanting to waste a day nor wanting to get wet tomorrow I decided to slack pack the next section. Tomorrow's weather report calls for 1.5"" of rain. So I'll hike today and zero tomorrow. Hiking this next section also will get two stream fords out of the way. 
Poet shuttled a group of us to Bald Mountain Stream Road. On the way to the trailhead we had to get out of the Chevy Suburban so Poet could maneuver over a deep depression in the road and cross a wooden bridge which was a significant bit higher than the road. At the trailhead four hikers headed sobo and I headed nobo back to the hostel. 
This section is pretty flat (Appalachian Trail flat). The fordings of the west branch and the east branch of the Piscataquis River went smoothly. Between the crossings the black flies were bothersome, even getting in my mouth and nose at times. 
Midway I heard frequent warning calls from a big bird. Not sure if it was a falcon, hawk or an eagle but it was not happy with my presence. Back at Gulf Hagas the same breed of bird circled me several times squawking its warning loudly. 
The bird today was aggressive. It swooped down to head level through the pine plantation. I got out of the way quickly while the bird returned to the forest's canopy. It continued to fling vile epithets at me. 
After failing to identify the creature and failing to get a picture I decided to continue. 
As the trail followed the shore of Lake Hebron I took a long break. I could see fish in the water chasing one another. A lone water lily floated in full bloom slowly dancing with the gentle waves. Loons called in the distance. Oh, I reluctantly got up and continued my hike. 
I arrived back in Monson earlier than I expected. 
Later I went to Robinson's Market for a meat lovers pizza. It was too much to eat so I shared it back at the hostel.","Monson, ME

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596056,"[NOTE: Don't miss the photo from Barren Mountain on June 25 in the photo gallery.]The rain started before dawn and continued into this evening. Nothing as bad as was predicted.
I purchased some food supplies at Monson General Store. I was excited to see Spam single packets and began picking them up. Then Sweet said he wanted some so I shared.  I told a female hiker I got Spam packets expecting her to not like the thought but she wanted some. We inquired about more but that's all they had. Almost a Spam riot in Monson. I got the only bag of onion bagels they have also but split it with Sweet. 
Then I bought more supplies, fuel, and sock liners at Poet's Emporium Gear Shop next to the hostel. I am ready to push to Rangeley, 91 miles away. If short on food I could go two miles off trail near Stratton if necessary. 
This evening Sweet, Radio and I went to the Spring Creek Bar-B-Q and Blind Dog Saloon. There was a procedure on how to get your food. Like: look at the chalkboard for the menu, proceed to the barmaid to give your order, sit down and wait for your name to be called, go to the kitchen window to pick up your order, if you want a waitress bring one yourself, when finished go to the kitchen entrance and place plates, silverware and trash into the correct bins. I was a bit nervous that I might violate a rule. 
The food was good and the place became packed. I had a pork barbecue sandwich so full and juicy I had to eat it with a fork. The Moxie soda, a Maine local soda,  led to a debate on what it tasted like. The barmaid said it tastes like Jagermeister for children, no alcohol. I agreed. 
We headed back to the hostel in the rain. I packed up Mav-sen my backpack (top is from old  Maverick and bottom from newer Lassen). Looks like tomorrow at 9 a.m. we'll head out to Bald Mountain Stream Road. Since I don't think I'll make it to Caratunk before the river shuttle shuts down for the day Saturday, I'll probably stay in the tiny village overnight.","Monson, ME

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596154,"Poet shuttled us back to Bald Mountain Stream Road. In the group was Scot (I think is his name) his son Josh, 17, and daughter Violet, 7. All hiking the AT. Amazing! 
I headed out at 9:35.  
Field Trip and his dog Penny passed by. We'd pass back and forth all day. 
Thunder near top of Bald Mountain. Then the storm hit. I was about to take the summit bypass when it got worse. I got my poncho out and got underneath. After 10 minutes a bolt hit close and it felt as if the ground slammed against my side. It hurt and I yelled. Then all was fine. I think it must have been a vibration or sound wave. Nothing electrical. But it briefly hurt. 
Went back and up over the AT to the top. Beautiful. Storm in the distance. Head down the mountain. 
Ben came up behind me. He was excited because while up on the summit he learned via cell he passed tests to go to law school. 
I congratulated him as he turned into a shelter. 
I stopped not far away at the campsites. A mother and two teenage daughters camped there asked me for bug spray. Fortunately I did have an extra bottle. 
A good day. A little scary. A little beautiful.","Bald Mountain Stream Road
",Bald Mountain Brook Campsite,"Jun 29, Fri",8.30
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596282,"I left camp at 5:55 a.m. but it wasn't early enough to beat the humidity. The three mile trail to Troutdale Road was easy and well maintained. 
As soon as I left the road to climb Pleasant Pond Mountain the humidity was bothersome. I expected to reach the top before 11 but it was around noon. I was dripping sweat and soaked with it. Most of the hikers commented about the weather. 
After two hours without water I came to a stream as I descended the mountain. A short distance later I took the side trail to Pleasant Pond leaving my pack and water. I had 15 minutes for the AquaMira to purify the water. I hiked down to the pond, took my shoes off and jumped in. People were swimming and motorboats were moving about. Then back to my pack and treated water in time to drink. 
I couldn't believe the sign saying 6 more miles to Caratunk. 
I headed out and pushed into town. Hoping to get there at 3 I didn't get in until 4:30. I was disappointed there were no rooms and no campsites left at the Caratunk House. I first noticed this house thru hiking the AT in 1998. I loved the design of this old house. I even took pictures of it. Thru hiking in 2008 I saw it again and it was for sale and a hostel. So, lately I heard the hostel was doing great and had a great breakfast. I was so looking forward to staying there in one in the rooms but it was not to be. I was very disappointed. Maybe another time. 
I had one of their milkshakes then headed out saying goodbye to the hikers. Field Trip gave me a hiker knuckle hit. 
I went the short distance to the Kennebec River to camp. Then I went down to the canoe shuttle landing for water and to jump in. 
I'm happy here. Saved some money. All I hear is the river flowing, a pair of woodpeckers on a dead tree near me and occasional traffic up on US 201. 
I think it was 6 years ago tonight (or within day or two) while on my Eastern Continental Trail hike that I camped on the opposite shore waiting for the shuttle the next morning.","Bald Mountain Brook Campsite
",Kennebec River at Caratunk,"Jun 30, Sat",14.80
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596384,"Today was to be easy until the humidity hit. At the shuttle were Rod, Kayak, Loco, Sunny Side Up (from Quebec), Midwest Momma, Field Trip and Penny, and myself. 
Kayak and I were the first to get shuttled over the Kennebec River. We thanked the guy who took us over then headed out.  Before I got the four miles to Pierce Pond everyone had passed me by. At one point I tripped and fell, snapping off four inches of my trekking pole. I adjusted the pole lengths and it is now functional. 
Humid and buggy. At East Carry Pond I jumped in the water. I was careful because I saw some leeches swimming around. I continued on the trail which became horribly muddy for several miles. Midwest Momma and I were passing back and forth since lunch. We came to a sign. Apparently this section at West Carry Pond is on the route of Benedict Arnold's doomed invasion route to Quebec. 
I came to the shelter exhausted. The humidity is brutal and I don't do well in it. I think I'll have to shorten my miles until it gets cooler.","Kennebec River at Caratunk
","West Carry Pond, ME","Jul 01, Sun",13.70
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596527,"Last night I thought I'd have to take a zero or cut my mileage in half because I felt so hot and tired. But this morning the wind was blowing and it seemed cooler. I packed up and got on the trail at 6:02. 
I took my time and drank frequently. The morning was cloudy and the breeze continued, allowing pleasant hiking. 
Going down Roundtop Mountain a moose ran down the trail in front of me. Thrush were singing their morning solos. 
After following Flagstaff Lake the trail began climbing Little Bigelow Mountain. The route to Little Bigelow Shelter was easier than I expected. At the shelter I dipped into the ""tub"" which to me is simply a pool of water under a waterfall. It was cold but I needed it. 
The rest of the route up the mountain was tough. The sun was now beating down on some of the steep barren rock the trail followed. But later clouds and a breeze eased the discomfort. I'd stop for a break whenever I started to sweat profusely, which was frequently. 
Finally on top, I was happy until hitting the multiple drops and climbs while crossing the ridge. I was getting hot and frustrated. But the trail dropped finally towards Stafford Notch and eventually I got to the campsites. 
Tomorrow are the tougher climbs over the rest of the Bigelow Mountain Range.","West Carry Pond, ME
",Stafford Notch Campsites,"Jul 02, Mon",12.60
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596613,"Stafford Notch is a deep notch between Little Bigelow Mountain and Avery Peak of the bigger Bigelow Mountain. So, because of my campsite there and the incident the other day I was concerned when a thunderstorm passed through early in the morning. The rain was heavy but lightning sparse. I enjoyed the sound of the rain on the tent. 
I left much later than planned. It was 7 a.m. The climb up Avery Peak was tough but not as tough as I expected. I'd stop when the sweating got bad. Giant boulders lined the trail along the way. Sometimes the trail was almost flat, allowing easier walking. I arrived at the summit in good time. 
The clouds were low and the views were limited. I didn't mind because the clouds shielded me from the sun. It was actually enjoyably chilly. 
Down, then back up, to West Peak. A few raindrops now and then as the wind swept ghost-like sheets of mist across in front of me. Two nobos went by. 
Down and over about two miles to South Horn. The sun was out and I began feeling the heat and humidity. 
Then steeply down to Horn Pond, a beautiful area. I treated two liters of water from a spring. I sat in an old lean-to now just for day use. I want to nap but a nobo hiker came in, slacking sobo through the Bigelows. I forgot about the nap as I talked with Ozzie. 
After he headed out I soon followed. The trail went up some then down, down, down, seemingly endlessly. One place was like an empty waterfall and I wondered if it really was the trail. I don't remember any of this hard stuff going nobo. I guess going nobo with the end in sight and 2000 mile legs, nothing seemed tough. But sobo, holy disco shoes. 
I was weakening from the heat even though I was hydrated. The brutality of the Bigelow along with the heat and humidity was hitting hard. I couldn't eat or drink anymore. 
At one point I thought I only had 0.7 to the road Then I saw a sign that said 0.9. I yelled !@#!×! Disco, a nobo and friend of Ozzie, came by slacking sobo also, right behind me. I apologized as he laughed. 
At the road he said he called the shuttle already. Not long afterwards we were at a hostel in the village of Stratton in the town of Eustis. The driver was just a hiker sent for us. He wasn't sure if there was room for me or not, but he took me. After about an hour and a half waiting for the owner, sometimes laying my head on the picnic table, I decided I had to do something. 
Midwest Momma was there whom I last saw at Little Bigelow Shelter. She saw the boulders and steepness of Avery Peak and decided it would be too difficult for her especially with a full pack. She is on her twelth year of section hiking the AT and is to finish up next year. She was a bit disappointed. 
As Midwest Momma, Ozzie and Disco went over to a restaurant, I headed a mile to Spillover Motel. They invited me to go along but I wasn't hungry and said I had to lie down soon. 
The motel was $102! But it had something the hostel/motel did not have: air conditioning. It was clean and nice. The hostel was not. 
Now I have to consider how long to stay. Two more days of 90 degree temps and a good climb up North and South Crocker Mountains are immediately ahead of me.","Stafford Notch Campsites
",Eustis,"Jul 03, Tue",10.40
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596724,"Early today I decided to stay one more night. For health concerns I think it is the wisest though most expensive choice I have. Then hitch out tomorrow morning  to the trail. Since it is still to be hot and muggy I'll hike two miles to the first stream and sit out the day. Friday the weather is to break and be much cooler. If not too hot tomorrow morning perhaps I can hike the five miles to the top of the Crickets and down the other side to the South Branch of the Carrabassett River and camp. 
Today I went to the Looney Moose Cafe for breakfast. For a good price I had home fries, western omelet, toast and coffee. And it was great. 
Then I walked into town to do laundry. I purchased some food at Fotter's Market. On the nearly mile walk back to the motel I was so hot and sweaty. As I walked I commented to a woman how beautiful her flowers were as she was watering her plants. She thanked me. Across the street a little boy yelled ""Hi!"" just as he did yesterday. 
After cooling off at the motel I took my gear outside to get dry. Some wetness from the showers yesterday morning and perhaps mostly from my sweating. 
I stayed in the rest of the day. It is so hot and the guests using the rarely needed individual air conditioner units that the circuit breaker keeps shutting off every few minutes. Then the poor clerk turns the breaker back on. For now it is cool inside.","Eustis

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596767,"There is a heat advisory today so I wanted to be on the road to hitch by 8 a.m.  But I got around earlier than expected and thanks to Tod picking me up I was on the trail at 8 a.m. (Tod said no second d in his name as TOD are the initials of his full name). 
Hot at first but I cooled down after the first mile. The trail is 5.1 miles up to North Crocker's summit and I was determined to take my time and arrive at 1 p.m. 
I treated water at the 2 mile mark. This is where I though I'd camp if not feeling well but I was feeling very good. 
Continue climbing but very nice. The trail seemed to stay on the north side of the mountain. At the 4 mile mark the sun was shining right on me through the stunted trees and the trail became steeper and rockier. I was dripping sweat again. But a few minutes before 1 p.m. I went over the top. The smell of the evergreens was strong. I was happy to be back on the trail. 
The trail dropped then climbed and after a mile from North Crocker I arrived at South Crocker. Time was 1:50 pm.  Met sobo Zach who started 6 days after I did. He's a hiking machine. Then met three people who are doing the northeast USA 4,000 footer challenge. They are doing the Crockers and now have climbed 85 of the 115 4,000 footers in the northeast. And they were originally from near where I live, Wellsboro, PA. 
Also, I saw Midwest Momma slackpacking today. She decided to get back on the trail and finish her goals for this year. She will retry the Bigelow in a few days. Then next year she will do the 100 Mile Wilderness and complete her 13 year quest to hike the Appalachian Trail. (Remember sometime back a father and son team were finishing up their 13 year quest to complete the AT).  I'm running into lots of hiking machines today. 
The trail dropped off South Crocker steeply but not before granting a splendid view of the Bigelows Mountain Range. 
The trail became so steep and rocky I had to hold on to white birch trees to descend safely. 
The trail's drop eased up and at 4:20 I came to the West Branch of the Carrabassett River. I was happy and set up camp. I felt a bit lightheaded so I made sure I drank plenty. 
On the opposite side of the stream (more like a stream than a river) is a very steep and rocky climb up towards Sugarloaf Mountain, so I opted to save that for tomorrow. 
Tomorrow probability of rain is 100%. Cooler temperatures will certainly help hiking. The rain will determine how far I get. For now hoping to hit Rangeley Saturday afternoon. Its around 24 miles.","Eustis

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596800,"I was expecting rain overnight but there was none. But just after daylight there were a few showers. Twice I tried to pack up but had to hastily retreat to the tent. Finally the coast was clear and I packed up and headed out. 
Shortly after crossing the little river the trail went up. This section I knew was brutal and dangerous. To make it worse it began to rain heavily...torrentially. 
Muddy water came down the mountain with multiple brown cascades. This was the trail. The rain was warm and I did not put on my rain jacket. I did have the pack cover on and my rain hat.
The climb was extremely steep as I remembered. Thunder echoed in the distance and I listened with slight alarm. After a mile the steep trail slackened as well as the rain. 
At the side trail to Sugarloaf Mountain the rain stopped and the trail became pleasant to walk...for miles. The sun even came out now and then. No rain for the rest of the day. 
Some places the trail's foliage had not been trimmed in years. I was getting wet from both sides. But the good trail and cooler temperatures made it tolerable. 
There were lots of downed trees from previous storms. Hikers had made a trail by bushwhacking around them so the detours were easy. 
The wind picked up in the afternoon and the temperature kept dropping. At Overton Stream the water was above the stepping stones so I just went across acquiring wetter feet. The rest of me dried due to the winds but not my feet. 
The climb up to Poplar Ridge was almost as steep as that of this mornings but not as boulder bound and eroded. Once over the top I began to get cold. 
At windy Poplar Ridge Shelter hikers were bundled up. I quickly got water and into my tent. Now I was cold! I made Idahoan mashed potatoes to get some warmth in me. 
I huddled down in my sleeping bag just wanting to stay warm. Outside the winds were blowing through the forest.

I almost dreaded morning for fear of being too cold. But as soon as daylight began I got my coffee going, and the stove helped heat the tent. 
Two shirts, my vest, and my rain jacket kept my upper body warm. Just wore shorts and wet shoes. I was on the trail at 5:40 a.m. 
After three miles a steep climb began. But once on top I was standing on Saddleback Junior with excellent views. The winds were howling. 
Continuing on,  the climb became steep again and after a few hours I was on the northern peak of Saddleback Mountain and above the treeline. I could see way back to the Crocketts, the Bigelows and far beyond. 
The sun was intense and the wind strong. If I hit a patch of trees shielding me from the wind it seemed hot. Then leaving the protection into the openness it was cold again. 
Dropping down in the saddle I came to two small ponds with what I call wild cotton. They were dancing in all directions energized by the wind. 
The climb up the main summit of Saddleback was with excitement. The openness of the mountain, the constant wind, and the moon's waning gibbous above the summit stirred me to press harder to reach the top. 
On top I looked all around with a big smile. How beautiful! I could see forever. I could see the White Mountains in New Hampshire. I could see the mountain boundaries of Maine and Quebec. A wonderful morning. 
It was a long drop but a delightful drop off the mountain while above the treeline. Once into the trees it was an on and off steep descent to the highway. Finally after several hours I arrived at the road. I walked up a bit to the Hiker Hut. Owner Steve took me into Rangeley. After eating a burger at the Red Onion I went to the IGA for six days worth of food. This will be enough food to get me 80 miles to Gorham, New Hampshire. Steve picked me up and we went back to the Hiker Hut. 
There were four other hikers there, all Sobos. I haven't seen any Sobos for two days. 
After chatting I retired to my hut. It has a bed and one side is open overlooking a stream. I think I shall have a good night's sleep.","Poplar Ridge Shelter

Catherine, the other owner of the Hiker Hut, made me an egg sandwich for breakfast. After a few pictures I thanked her and headed out. While there I found a new pair of shoe insoles in the hiker box. My right one was deteriorating rapidly. I didn't even need to cut them as they fit perfectly. 
The trail was gentle for about nine miles allowing me to make good time. I went by several large ponds. 
After Sabbath Day Pond Lean-to the trail returned to its usual steep and rugged personality. Not only that but it became hot.

Glad I did not go up the mountain last night as originally planned. When I got to the location where I had wanted to camp it was over 2 1/2 hours. I would have gotten up there around dark. 
For a few miles the route was on smooth rock surfaces. Fairly easy walking. The views were fantastic. 
The forest was incredibly thick in spots. Sometimes I could only see 20 or 30 feet into the treeline. Sometimes the woods were thin enough I could see for miles. At one viewpoint I could see the Bigelows, Crockers, Saddleback...wow, I can't believe I hiked this far. 
On top of Old Blue Mountain it was open and very hot. The bugs were bothersome. I headed down at 3:30. I wasn't sure how far down. Different sources had 3 miles or 5 miles. I had thought this would be a short day. I did take some long breaks at the views however. 
I thought I might camp if I saw a nice spot and there was water. I saw some nice sites but no water. Down and down, sometimes incredibly and dangerously steep. There was no water I would drink all the way down. But I was relieved to come to the road at 5:30, cross Black Brook, and establish camp. It was hot and I was lightheaded. 
I went back to the creek for water. When I pull the Nalgene bottle out I saw a black thing on the side. I shook the bottle and the thing fell to a rock. Then it spread itself out. Yuck! A leech! No swimming in this creek for me. 
For supper I made Idahoan Applewood Smoked Bacon mashed potatoes. I have several flavors but that's my favorite. One thing about these mashed potatoes is all the herbs and spices floating around in them. I go by faith that's what floating, not bugs and dirt. Sometimes it can be crunchy...hmmm.

The climb up Moody Mountain was not bad but the drop on the other side was difficult. The climb up Wyman Mountain was not bad. I passed a dozen teens going up. 
At Hall Mountain shelter on top I took a break. The tired teens came in not long behind me. The teen leader was carrying a big topographical map and instructed the others to sit and eat. All pulled out what appeared to be big bags of trail mix. One guy asked if this was what they had for breakfast. Another said ""No. We had Grapenuts."" The first guy then said ""Don't remind me."" I took it they didn't like their trail food. 
I pulled out a bagel and I got the looks. They started salivating. I felt threatened. I picked up my trekking poles and told them ""Nobody make a move towards my bagel and all will be well."" Then I gave my cougar growl and they backed away. If I had gotten out my Chips Ahoy, Pringles BBQ chips, and Snickers bars I may not have lived to tell you the tale. 
The trail for the miles to Dunn's Notch was delightful as I made my escape. It did get hot as I crossed a road and a creek. After following the stream I saw a waterfall and huge pool of water. I was in and under as fast as I could. So good to get that sweat off and cool down. 
The climb up Surplus Mountain was good. But at the end it was a brutal descent down to Frye's Notch Shelter. 
The shelter was full and tents all around. This is not for me. I did find a place up the trail. It was 7 p.m. Though it was a 13 hour day I felt pretty good. Still on schedule to make Gorham, New Hampshire Friday. 
Thursday I will hit the infamous Mahoosuc Notch. It takes hours to navigate the truck size boulder filled mile. Also Thursday I will enter New Hampshire.

Dropped 2,400 feet to Grafton Notch. Glad to see a trash bin and get rid of some weight. Now the four mile 2,500 foot climb up to Old Speck Mountain. I knew the trail would not be so steep from hiking it in the past. 
Before a vista near the top a young day hiker flew by me. At the vista where you could see up to the summit he turned around. I asked why and he responded he was afraid he'd run out of daylight. I told him it is only 3 p.m. and he would be to the top in 30 to 40 minutes. I said he'd be all the way down by 7. He reluctantly said ""All right!"" and he continued climbing. 
A minute later a couple came up, saw the summit from the vista and turned around. I tried to encourage them the same as I did the young guy earlier but they headed down anyway. 
To my surprise, I reached the ridge at 3:30. I dropped my pack and walked to the summit. A bunch of Sobos I met earlier were there. The young guy said he was happy he decided to continue and reach the summit. 
I climbed the old fire tower, now an observation deck. I slept up here in 2008 on one beautiful star-filled night. At the top the views again were outstanding. I could see way down to the notorious Mahoosuc Notch. 
I headed out dropping first to Speck Pond. At the outlet I treated some water. Then DOWN the horribly steep Mahoosuc Arm. Brutal, brutal, brutal. 
I found a place to camp just a short distance into Mahoosuc Notch. It was 7:39 p.m. By the time I got water, had the tent up and cooked supper it was getting dark, being in the notch.

Just an hour and a half and I was through the worst mile on the trail. I'd have argued the Mahoosuc Arm was worst than the notch. 
After a 1,000 foot climb in a mile I came to Full Goose Shelter. There were teens all over the place. I couldn't even get into the shelter to sign the register. I got water and headed out quickly, politely pushing my way through the wild group. 
Up and over the Goose Eye Peaks. Again, great views. I even cooked potatoes up on the North Peak while taking in the views. 
I then had two steep climbs. The climbs were more cliffs than a climb. Fortunately they didn't last too long. 
At 1:40 p.m I crossed the state line into New Hampshire!  From Mount Katahdin to this point is 281.8 miles. 
I was trying to get as close to the next town as possible today so I kept pushing myself. 
After going over Mt. Success I stopped near Gentian Pond Shelter for water. Then I continued. The trail climbed and had a lot of fallen trees. 
Finally, through the trees I saw water. There was Dream Pond, my secondary destination. It was too late and I was too tired to go another two miles to Trident Col tent site but this was my backup plan. It was 8:20 p.m. It took 15 hours to go 14.4 miles but it was tough miles.

Thankfully I had enough fuel to do them separately. 
On the trail at 5:40. As by law, the trail went uphill. Went over Cascade Mountain and Mount Hayes. I could see into Berlin and the Wal-Mart where I'll be tomorrow. The sun had been out and it became hot. 
The trail dropped over ledges and down stone steps. I came to Hogan Road earlier than expected. I crossed over Androscoggin River. The bridge is right next to the dam and outgoing waters rushed white and loud next to and under the bridge. 
At Route 2 I turned right and headed towards Gorham. Sounds strange but I was too hot and tired to hitch hike. 
After a mile or so I stopped for a break at a campground. I got a Coke and a Drumstick (ice cream) at the campstore. 
I continued another mile or so and got a room at the Town and Country Inn. The AT Companion book said rooms were $40 but it was $95! Second time that happened. I simply didn't want to continue so I stayed. 
After a shower and doing laundry I headed into Gorham. I saw a Subway and that became my destination. Also stopped at Cumberland Farms for milk and chips. Then the long walk back to the inn in Shelburne. Actually only a half mile but it seemed long. Had pain on my toe and realized it is a corn.

On my 2.5 mile walk to Berlin Wal-Mart I had planned to stop at MacDonalds for breakfast. But due to renovations only the drive thru was open. I continued to Wal-Mart with no breakfast. 
At Wal-Mart I picked up a two pound container of peanut butter. Going up and down the aisles I saw Spam singles! Back went the peanut butter.

Raindancer and Stovekicker are section hikers from Virginia and enjoy helping hikers. They dropped me off at the Rattle River trailhead. I thanked them and began hiking at 9:10 a.m. 
The trail was on an old road for a few miles and I loved it. The trail followed close along boulder-filled Rattle River and both climbed the mountain together. 
Near the final crossing of the now tiny river I got my last water. Then the trail climbed steeply, frequently on stone steps. This climb started at 780 feet and ceased at 4,000 feet in about 6 miles. 
Skunkman flew by. At Mount Moriah I got to talk with him. His busy life allows him only a short time to hike every year. This is his 20+ year. He plans to finish the trail in 2037. Yes, 2037. I have to admire him for his commitment and desire to complete what he started. He said he loves it out here. 
I stopped at Imp Shelter for water. These shelters one has to pay for to stay so I moved on. Skunkman was there and we talked some more. Next time I'll ask him how he got his name though it may be obvious. 
A mile out from the shelter I got off the trail and camped. In the White Mountains if we don't stay at a shelter or hut we have to camp 200 feet off the trail. 
Looks like I'm at the base of North Carter Mountain. It's a climb I'll delay until morning.

Going up Mt. Hight was the toughest. Then there was Carter Dome after which there was a frightful drop into Carter Notch. 
At the lake in Carter Notch I got water and had lunch. Skunkman was nearby. 
Then another steep climb up Wildcat peaks A, B, C, then finally D. On Peak D the operator of the gondola lift, John, gave me two liters of badly needed water. 
I headed out dropping steeply and dangerously down the mountain. In one mile I came to a spring and stopped. I had had enough. 
Not too long behind me Flash came in. He tumbled coming down the last hill. His hands, legs and head were bleeding. His step-son came in shortly and they camped nearby. They even mentioned how hot and slow the miles were today.

Then I heard Flash say high winds this morning then rain at 9 a.m. I then decided to get up and get off the mountain. 
Flash had left and Honeybear was doing a phone chat. Not sure what you call it. As I walked out he turned the camera towards me and introduced me as Lake who has done the Appalachian Trail three times. I smiled and waved. It was 6:30 a.m. 
I quickly realized I wasn't as far down the mountain as I thought and there was still over a thousand foot drop. Wildcat Mountain is known for the steep trail in this section. Perhaps the absolute steepest climb/descent on the AT. The humidity was bothering my breathing as I descended. 
I made it down to leveler ground but the trail negotiated around a large boulder for a bit. I was sweating. At a stream I noticed it started raining. 
After two hours I cross NH 16 and stopped at the Appalachian Mountain Club's Pinkham Notch Visitors Center. I immediately dropped my pack outside and got in line for the breakfast buffet. 
Honeybear came in and asked where Flash was. I said he went the wrong way down a mini cliff. I went the right way and saw him near the bottom and he was ok but behind me. A while later, in the pouring rain, Flash came in. 
We had a good breakfast and a good talk. Then we headed for the store. I needed floss and was happy they had it. 
Outside I checked the radar and there was a break in the light rain. Looks like no yellow or orange areas on the radar near us. I told Flash then I headed out. It was 10 a.m. 
The trail followed Old Jackson Road and wasn't too difficult. Then it climbed and became a trail easy to walk. There were several side streams and waterfalls. 
Rain started and I covered my backpack and put on my rain hat. Due to the humidity I was sweating pretty bad so hiked with no shirt or rain jacket. The rain felt good on me. 
From 10:30 to 11 I heard four booms of thunder but the rain remained gentle. We had heard heavy downpours, flooding, and maybe a tornado but nothing threatening yet. 
I crossed the narrow swaying cable suspension bridge over the west branch of Peabody River. I noticed the rain had stopped. I checked my data book and had less than a mile to go to the campsite at the base of Mount Madison. 
About 1:30 I heard thunder again. I pushed to get to the campsite. My big concern for the day was how was I going to get up my tent in a drenching downpour. 
But at 2:02 my tent was up on a wooden tent platform at Osgood Campsite. Except for the bottom of my backpack, the pack cover and my clothes, all was dry. 
Tomorrow I hope to leave early and climb 2.5 steep miles up to Mount Madison and on to Mount Washington. Tomorrow is to be mostly sunny after morning showers.

I left at 4:40 a.m. for the 2,866 foot climb up Mt. Madison. Raindrops hanging to fir needles reflected my headlamp as the night slowly vanished. 
Over Mt. Madison at 9 a.m. Then around several mountains but not going over the top. Several drops and climbs but the trail was basically climbing to 6,288 foot Mt. Washington. 
I saw one of the coal fired engines start up the Cog railway blowing its whistle and spreading a black cloud of smoke. I hoped to get to the railroad crossing for a picture. 
It takes a long time for the train to get up the mountain. One engine spewing diesel exhaust went by. Later I could see the black smoke over a small rock rise. I hustled up the trail and did get a picture. People on the train took pictures of me. 
I made it to the top at 3:45 p.m. A thru hiker who had gotten off the trail due to injury offered me a beer. I declined but then she offered me a soda and pulled out a Dr. Pepper! Thank you, Rowdy! 
I went in the visitor center and got a piece of pizza, egg salad sandwich, and a pint of potato salad. I sat near the door eating the food and drinking the Dr. Pepper. 
Except for the final climb up to the top of Mt. Washington I wore my long sleeve shirt, vest, and rain jacket. I was feeling cold and bundled up again. Wind speed was up to 63 mph today and it was cold due to the cold front that came in yesterday.

Beautiful views all over. The sun was brilliant once again and only a light breeze. 
I think due to the wind, the hike, and lack of sleep I was feeling pretty lousy. I think the egg and potato salad was the cause of turbulence in my stomach. 
At Mizpah Spring Hut I asked if they had something for upset stomach. The only thing they had was Tums. I got that and an apple juice, filled my water containers and headed out. The Tums seemed to help. 
At the first campsite away from the hut's protective environment zone I stopped. I pulled out my air mattress and laid down. I fell asleep for an hour. When I got up I felt much better. 
I headed out climbing Mt. Jackson and Mount Webster. There were some tough ups and downs. The sun's rays and heat would bother me in the open summits.

I packed and headed out before sunrise. It would be a three mile hike and around a 2,000 foot drop down to Crawford Notch and US 302. At Webster Cliffs I saw Flash and Honeybear. (I thought I camped at Webster Cliffs but was back a mile.) Flash gave me some meds for my stomach. He followed me to the highway. It was around 8 a.m. when we arrived. Flash continued on the trail as I contemplated what to do. 
After a car pulled in to leave off hikers I asked one of the guys if they were from around here.   I saw the Arizona plates and knew my answer. However, Jason, the driver, was more than happy to give me a ride wherever I needed to go. Earlier he had dropped off his thru hiking wife ""Groceries"" here. Then, back at his campground, he saw other hikers and brought them back to this trailhead. 
Jason took me to his campground where no medicine was available. The owner suggested a walk in urgent care facility in Glen. Jason had no problem taking me there and insisted on remaining with me while waiting. 
We went to Saco River Medical Group in Glen. The staff was so kind to me. I was seen quickly. Jason returned to the campground to get his gear and returned while I was getting treated. On the scales I lost 22 pounds over the course of the hike. 
Since it might be days until test results would come in, I was given a medicine for bacterial infection. Before I left the medical office the staff called around for a motel for me to stay in. They strongly urged me not to go to a campground. 
Jason took me to Walgreens in Conway, waited with me, then took me to the Intervale Motel. He was going to Gorham to camp as he waited for his wife going through the presidential range. He said not to hesitate to call for any assistance I might need.

It was all too soon and we were once again saying those heart tugging goodbyes. Heartrock will drive two hours to visit her sister, Thunder Island Girl, in Maine. (Thunder Island Girl is taken from two songs: Thunder Island and Island Girl). 
Now I'm starting back on the trail at Crawford Notch. I left at 10:45 a.m. I unfortunately wasted time because I went on the wrong trail. But soon, all was corrected and up I went. The trail began with a steady climb but soon became the usual steep boulder-filled endurance course. After two hours I was over the top. The trail became steadier but rocky and muddy. I was soaked in sweat. 
I met one sobo, a young woman named Fay.  We each mentioned some names of hikers we knew but none were familiar. I also passed several groups of nobos throughout the day. 
The trail followed a stream and then it was on an old railroad bed. Great hiking for miles! It even seemed cooler for a while. 
I expected to reach Zealand Falls Hut about 5-6 pm but arrived at 3:45! I was happy. I went inside and filled my two bottles with water. After I drank one I filled it right up again. Met a guy also going sobo. 
I left at 4:10 wanting to get another mile in. I knew it was a climb but not that it was so steep. Over a mile of rock steps, boulders and roots. At 5:15 I leveled off after a sweaty 1,070 foot climb. I went out a short side trail to Zeacliff Vista and found a campsite. I can look way down to see the railroad bed I followed earlier today. 
Aside from a little upset stomach I feel pretty good and pretty strong. My corn hurts but much better than a few weeks ago. My only concern now is if it will rain tonight and tomorrow. Friday it is to be sunny, a good day to go over Mt. Lafayette where the trail is 2.5 miles above the  treeline.","Crawford Notch, NH

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600242,"Only a light rain overnight and the tent was dry when I woke up. The view from the vista was mostly clouds and fog. I packed up and was on the trail at 6:15. 
The trail was in good shape and for most of the day hiking was at a good speed...most of the day. Light rain hit going over Zealand Mountain and only lasted around 20 minutes. 
A steep climb up South Twin Mountain and a steeper climb down. On top at 10 a.m. It took me one hour and ten minutes to go 0.8 of a mile downhill. The drop was 1,122 boulder filled feet down what seemed like a power line and not a trail. 
At the bottom I stopped at Galehead Hut for coffee and pineapple cake. The benches outside were lined with backpacks. 
The trail was good for a while afterwards then another brutal climb up Mt. Garfield. Some was more like cliff climbing than boulder climbing. Great views on top in all directions. 
This morning I  thought possibly I could push over Mt. Lafayette but as I observed the mountain from the top of Mt. Garfield I could see the distance was probably pushing myself too far with all of today's climbs. The top was in the clouds and it was windy. I decided it was best to go towards my original planned destination of near Skookumchuck Trail. 
I continued for two more hours. I got water at Garfield Pond on the way. At 4:50 I saw a campsite and decided this was the camp for the night. 
Saw lots of nobos and lots of hikers going hut to hut today. Talked a bit with nobos Cheddar and Charlie. They gave me a clue where to camp. Easily saw 50 people heading north. Only one suspected sobo passed me by. 
Breezy and a bit chilly at the moment. Only sound is the wind going through the trees. 
Tomorrow is to be beautiful. The hike over Mt Lafayette down to Little Haystack Mountain is above the treeline and is an awesome section to hike. Looking forward to the morning.","Zeacliff Vista, NH

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600347,"Light rain around 3 a.m. I enjoy hearing the soothing sound of the rain on the tent. In the distance I heard thunder but it got fainter and fainter. 
I left at 6:50 under a cloudy sky. I could hear the wind in the trees and it was potent. 
Seems I camped not as close to Skookumchunk Trail as I thought and it was a good thing. When I reached the trail junction it was above the treeline and extremely windy. I had to completely bundle up. 
The climb up Mt Lafayette was of little concern because it was the strong winds that posed a threat. I was in the clouds and I am convinced in the strongest winds I ever endured. I was seriously concerned if I could continue. Then a couple and their German Shepherd came down so I pressed on. 
At one point the sun came out briefly and there were great views even if just for a moment. 
The winds were brutal! This was the worst I ever experienced. Up and over Lafayette and down briefly where I was out of the wind. A few photo opportunities but too quick for the camera. 
Halfway to Mt. Lincoln the clouds began to disappear but not the wind. Gorgeous views down Franconia Ridge. Scores of day hikers coming up exclaiming how beautiful the views were and strong the winds were. 
At the treeline I could take my gloves, rain jacket, vest, and long sleeve shirt off as I was out of the wind. Around 10 a.m. I made it to Mt. Liberty. It is an over 3,000 foot drop down a steep rock riddled ""trail"" to the base. I stopped at Liberty Springs for water. Then a long, long hike down. My foot corn was crying in pain. 
I reached the bottom after 2 p.m. and crossed under the dual bridges of I-93 by the Pemigawasset River. The trail climbed up a hill and away from the noisy Interstate. 
I met two 70ish nobo hikers, Old Scout and Curb. We talked for a while and continued our opposite hiking. 
At Cascade Brook I decided to camp even though it was just 3:30. I was tired and wanted to be fresh for climbing the Kinsman Mountains tomorrow. 
After setting up camp I took a nap and then a bottle shower. Nice to be clean after three sweaty days. 
Today was a beautiful day full of interesting challenges. From being cold and bundled up to sweating and walking in shorts and no shirt. 
Three weeks ago today I had sought medical help and thought my trip was over. I was heartbroken...and just plain sick. Thanks to everyone's prayers, trail angel Jason, Judith at the Sack River urgent care, and Heartrock taking me home then bringing me all the way back to New Hampshire, we are continuing what we started. I am tearfully grateful. It's good to be back on the trail once again. 
Well, looks like I'll reach Kinsman Notch Sunday morning. I'll hitch into North Woodstock for a resupply. That will get me 55 miles to the next resupply in Norwich, Vermont.","Skookumchuck Trail

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600461,"Left camp at 6:30 a.m.  Looks like a beautiful day. After a mile and a half I stopped at Lonesome Lake Hut. I got a coffee. While talking to a hiker who was there doing work-for-stay a hut worker handed us both a broom. He must have thought I was a work-for-stay too. I thought about it but the coffee wasn't worth the sweep. So, I got a piece of cake and paid for it as well as the coffee. 
I headed up North Kinsman. It was not bad for a 4,000 foot peak. There were a few tough spots but nothing like I experienced yesterday. Again, scores of day hikers most doing their collection of 4,000 foot peaks. At one view I could see back to Franconia Ridge, which I was on yesterday. 
A drop to the saddle then an easy climb up higher South Kinsman Peak. All going well...but that changed. Dangerous steep drops down from South Kinsman. Sometimes I didn't know how to get down. But I had to keep in mind only one more 4,000 footer after today until southern Virginia. Tomorrow is Mt Moosilauke, a steep climb up but a carriage trail down. So, this is the last long horrendous drop. 
The trail followed Eliza Brook for a while and displayed numerous waterfalls. When the trail crossed the creek near Eliza Brook Shelter I got water. 
The next four miles of trail was a mix of great trail and terrible trail. My goal was to get close to Kinsman Notch and Route 112. Tomorrow is a town day. 
At Gordon Pond Trail junction I met three interesting young men heading north. We talked for about half an hour. We talked about our trail adventures. They asked me for suggestions about the rest of the trail, daily mileage, and the PCT and CDT. There was Bernie from Germany, Sherpa from Alabama, and Big Bunny. I forget where he was from but I had to ask how he got his name. He said he saw a big bunny, the size of a dog. So, everyone calls him Big Bunny now. 
We all agreed how sweet the trail life is. Everyone gets along and looks out for one another. Age, color, sex, where you're from, nothing matters. We all get along. It's how life should be. 
They headed north to a campsite I suggested and I headed south to one they suggested. It was 6 p.m. 
Now camped about three miles from the highway. Tomorrow a town stop!","Cascade Brook

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600549,"Rain overnight and the tent rainfly was wet. Used headlamp to pack up but not needed on trail when I left at 5:30 a.m. Woods were foggy. 
Arrived at Rt 112 at 7:45. The rain started, a fine light rain. I tried hitching but no success. Then a woman in the parking lot came over and said she called a shuttle to take her gear to Glencliff. She said she was slacking over Moosilauke with her uncle. The manager from the Hiker Welcome Hostel in Glencliff came and took me directly to Price Chopper in Lincoln for $6! (That's all the cash I had on me). I thanked him then got groceries for the next section of trail. 
I stopped at Rite Aid for bandage tape for my corn then west to McDonald's for the Big Breakfast. It's 1,330 calories. 
Afterwards I hiked out of town and stopped at the Notch Hostel for a shuttle ride. A hiker there, Blue, who thru hiked last year and is now assisting friends, drove me back to the trail head at Kinsman Notch. I was back on the trail at 11:15 a.m.! That was a quick blitz into town and back. 
I headed up Mt. Moosilauke (I think it Indian for ""you'll see moose if you're lucky""). This is just under a 3,000 foot climb. Its goes almost straight up on rocks, rock steps, and wooden steps rebarred into the solid rock. The trail follows along Beaver Brook with its many tall waterfalls. It has been raining all day and everything was slick. 
The Beaver Brook Shelter side trail was at 1.5 miles up. It took me two hours and 15 minutes to get to that point. The trail continued at the same steep climb for half a mile then eased off. 
I arrived at the foggy windy rainy cold open summit about 3:30. I got a quick picture then followed the old carriage trail downhill and into the treeline. The rain had stopped as I began my descent. 
I thought the carriage trail was followed all the way down the mountain but I was mistaken. The trail veered off and descended steeply on boulders for a few miles before hitting some actual good trail. 
After a 2,500 foot drop I passed through some fields of milkweed and onto a paved road. Then nice trail to Jeffers Brook Shelter. There I met and talked with Canon and Goldilocks. Similar to my time off trail, they also got off at Crawford Notch for two weeks for a foot injury. 
It was 7 p.m. and I was beat. I didn't expect to get in and out of town so quick. I figured I'd camp a few miles up Moosilauke from the highway. A tough but blessed productive day!","Gordon Brook Trail
",Jeffers Brook Shelter,"Aug 12, Sun",11.70
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600635,"This morning I wanted to stop at Welcome Hiker Hostel about a mile away so I was in no rush to get going. That was also good because I was sore from yesterday. 
I left camp at 7:17. After fording Jeffers Brook I headed up Rt 25 into tiny Glencliff. 
At the hostel the shower and washing machine were vacant so I used both and the dryer. Each cost $3. I also charged my Pocket Juice, a recharger for my phone. 
I was set to leave at 10:30 then met three older hikers who hiked in 1998 as I did. We did not know each other but each knew names of other hikers we all mentioned. 
Rain at 11 so I delayed. The rain ended at 11:30 and I headed out reaching the trail at 11:40. A late start and with only a mile in for the day I wondered how far I would get. 
I knew the trail would get better but I didn't remember exactly what level of better. The trail turned out great! I finally was cruising! Though I don't have speed legs yet since we couldn't develop a good stride yet, I was very pleased how well it was going. The first five miles I did each in 35 minutes. I was very happy. 
Later I stopped to rebandage my foot corn I did minor surgery on back at the hostel. I had it wrapped in first aid tape and it was coming off. I could feel the pain increasing. I fixed it and was on my way. 
What a great feeling to finally break loose from sometimes less than a mile an hour to almost two an hour. With some more stretching the legs perhaps 2.5. Only a few times in the past have I hit 3 or more. That had to have been good trail and leading to town food. 
Stopped at Brackett Brook about 6:40. I did not want to push over Mt. Cube although it hasn't been tough. I didn't want to be on top if it rains tonight. 
Lets see what mileage the Lake Express can do tomorrow. Excellent chance I could cross the Connecticut River and be in Vermont Wednesday. I like a challenge.","Jeffers Brook Shelter

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600737,"Rain all morning up until 6:15 a.m. I was all packed except the tent so when the rain ceased I quickly packed up and got on the trail at 6:30. 
My hope for a high mileage day and continued good trail evaporated within hours. The trail up Mt. Cube was rocky and muddy. Only the sound of a thrush made me smile. 
Down Cube on slick rocks. Came to a fine view of cloud covered Smarts Mountain. On the way up Smarts the trail was steady but nobos were warning me of terrible mud areas ahead. They were right. About two miles of the trail were off and on mudholes. The progress was slow and slippery. Humidity was extremely bothersome. 
Good news was that at the same time I was hiking teams of teens were hauling wood up the mountain piece by piece to build boardwalks where needed. 
Got to the top at 2 p.m. I wasn't happy with the mileage so far. No way would I reach Vermont tomorrow. 
A long drop down the mountain. Some good views along the way. Clouds looked threatening but they held their moisture. 
I crossed a dirt road and had two good miles of trail. Old stone walls lined the trail. The walls were relics of old pasture land boundaries now reforested. 
Crossed another road and, after a mile, camped at Trapper John Shelter, 6:20 p.m. 
A tough muddy rocky sweaty day but 15 miles closer to Vermont and better trail. Looks like Vermont early Thursday.","Brackett Brook

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600750,"This morning was delightful. Sun coming out through the trees and less humidity. At Goose Pond Road a trail angel left two of those large blue containers of water for us thirsty hikers. 
Moose Mountain was a long but graded trail up. Humidity was building and at 11:30 I heard loud thunder. I had been taking my time all morning enjoying the good trail but now I hustled to the Moose Mountain Shelter. 
At the shelter Green Machine and a father and son from Australia had sought a covering from the storm. I decided I wouldn't waste my time there and was going to shave since tomorrow was a town day. I walked back a few hundred feet to fetch water. As I was returning the rain began. 
At the shelter Green Machine was kind enough to have covered my backpack and gear I left outside the shelter with his backpack cover. I thanked him and said this is why I like the trail life, everyone looks out for each other. (His name is from all the greens he eats). 
The storm quickly went its way. As I was shaving Stink Bomb came in. Needless to say we all left quickly. (I named her but didn't tell her.) 
As the elevation dropped the temperature seemed to rise. The sun was out strong. But I didn't mind as tomorrow is a town day! Real food! Dr. Pepper! 
The trail continued to be in great shape. One long section was through a forest of giant pines. Stone walls went in various directions. The walls and the forest floor were covered in brown pine needles. 
At the side trail to Velvet Rocks I took a different side trail to the spring. 5:30 p.m. A 4' round aluminum pipe formed the spring's wall. Easy dipping for the water bottles. I dumped a cold one over my head to rinse the sweat off. 
Back to the side trail to Velvet Rocks Shelter then followed it for .4 of a mile. No one there. Most Sobos probably pushed into Hanover a mile and a half away. It is an expensive college town, home to Dartmouth College. 
Being close to town and 500 feet above it I can hear the hum of the traffic. Every now and then sirens blare. Every hour I hear church bells announcing the tally. 
Tomorrow a big day. Dunkin Donuts! Oh, yeah, Vermont too!","Trapper John Shelter

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600834,"Last night various thunderstorms roamed the area. Nothing serious and rain was light. I was surprised my rain fly was dry in the morning. 
Packed up and on trail same time as yesterday, 7:15. 
It was around a mile hike into town. As I walked down the street I was really startled for a moment. I was in front of the church I heard last night and when the bells began their 8 a.m. rings they were loud. They briefly scared me. 
I got denatured alcohol at the hardware store. I was devastated when I learned Dunkin Donuts closed. The woman at the hardware store said since the employment rate was so good in the state it is hard to retain workers in low paying jobs. Many small businesses have suffered. 
I headed out of town and crossed the Connecticut River into Vermont at 8:42. I was happy. 
In Norwich I stopped at Dan and Whit's General Store. I left my pack next to a bench outside. Inside the store was cluttered and had old wooden floors. But it was a busy store. I got a breakfast sandwich and chocolate milk and a free coffee then went outside. 
After I was finished eating and had enough sweating in the sun I went back in for groceries for a few days. They give hikers free day old sandwiches. I was given another breakfast sandwich and two pieces of pizza. 
After packing up I headed out and up Elm Street. Elm Street was paved and became steep. I was sweating badly. A sign said ""hikers welcome to swim"" at a fancy house but I thought I better not. 
A cooler with Gatorade was out on the road but I passed it by since I had Powerade on me. Two houses up another cooler with Coke. I couldn't resist. They also had tootsie pops in the mailbox. I sat on a chair they had there and I was soaked in sweat. 
A short distance up the dead end street the trail began. The trail was wonderful. Every now and then I hit a cool breeze as I climbed. The trail was so good and I was making good time; somehow I went a mile beyond the shelter I wanted to take a break at. I stopped and ate my free breakfast sandwich in the woods. 
After a few hours I dropped into the village of West Hartford. The popular deli was now closed. I stopped at a house where hikers can stay. I got a soda and two liters of water before heading out. 
After leaving the village and crossing the White River it was a steep climb up the road to the trail head. But once on the trail It was a beautiful five miles to the shelter. The trail was well graded. It weaved through old pine plantations and beautiful maple forests. Tubes for retrieving maple syrup ran in various directions. Fields of milkweed, yarrow, Queen Anne's Lace, clover and goldenrod were traversed. One field of about 20 acres was mowed and covered in thick green grass. The trail weaved about the field as it climbed to the wood line. What a great day of hiking! 
I came to the side trail to Thistle Hill Shelter at 6:45. After getting water way down a hill at a small waterfall I backtracked away from the shelter and set up camp. 
It is quiet now. Occasionally, like the last few nights, I hear Barred Owls calling.","Velvet Rocks Shelter

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601002,"The morning sun lit up my tent with an orange glow. A beautiful morning. The Barred Owl made some morning calls. 
I left the shelter area about 7:20. It seemed cooler and less humid. 
The trail was good all day. I call this the ridge and valley section because that's the route all day, up and down. But all was beautiful and the trail was good. 
At one road crossing a whining cat followed me for a while. It would run by me, jump on a log and do its scratch the log routine. Meow, meow, meow. After some distance a girl came the other way and said jokingly she cleared the trail of all spider webs. I jokingly asked her to take that cat with her. The cat followed her and I was on my way feline free. 
At one stream sodas were left in a bucket. I had a root beer and filtered water. 
In the afternoon I dropped to Rt 12. Just up the road is On The Edge Farm. I stopped here years past. Today I got a Hershey's Creamy Chocolate pint of ice cream, a Coke, and Frito corn chips. I sat out in the lawn on a picnic table in a light rain. The owner came out and told me to get on the porch which I did. Then it rained pretty well for half an hour. 
I headed out around 1:15 p.m. Rain stopped but it was humid. The trail went through some wet mowed fields before entering the woods. The trail seemed to climb for a long time but a nice climb. 
Around 4 p.m. I came to Winturri Shelter. A few hikers were there and a few came in. I got water then at 5 p.m. I decided to continue. 
I thought I'd fine a nice spot quickly and stop before the predicted rain tonight. But the trail was good and I kept going. After 2.4 miles beyond the shelter near the trail to the ""lookout"" light rain started and I saw a flat spot and stopped. 6:20 p.m. 
Got in the tent as light rain continued and thunder called from different directions. 
I earlier realized today was Friday not Saturday. I was planning on stopping at the Inn At the Long Trail tomorrow thinking it was Sunday. Fridays and Saturdays are busy there with hikers on the AT and the Long Trail as well as tourists in general. So, I guess tomorrow will be a short day. I will stop at the inn Sunday as planned. I was really going to push today but when I realized my error with the dates and the rain this afternoon I took it easy.

The rain stopped at 9:15 and I began to pack up. A few rays of sunshine hit the side of the tent. I was on the trail at a hiker shameful 9:45. I was a lackadaisical Rocky Mountain canary (figure that one out). 
The trail was wet all day and had many slippery roots. The woodlands were damp and the sun""s attempt to dry out the rain forest was in vain. 
Clouds came in around 1 p.m. as I stopped for a break. I gave a friendly chipmunk a lump of Skippy Super Chunky peanut butter. We sat near each other eating our portions but had no conversation. 
Up another hill and down to Stony Brook and crossed the bridge. Steamer came in and we talked. Rain came in and I headed out. Fortunately the rain didn't last long. 
Stopped at Stony Brook shelter after getting water at 2:45. Steamer came in as well as a girl and three guys, all separately. We all talked about the weather, trail magic, filters and if this shelter leaked. 
At 3:30 I headed out wanting to get a few more miles in. Up, and up what I believe was part of Quimby Mountain. I began looking for a campsite. I am picky but didn't want to go for hours like I did last night. Crossed a dirt road and found a place. It was 4:50. 
After setting up camp and getting in my tent I took off my shoes and socks. Holy bell bottoms trailman! My feet stank from being wet all day. I sprayed my shoes and feet with Off.

A short easy day today. Dropped off of Quimby Mountain, crossed the 900' boardwalk at Thundering Brook, then hiked by Kent Pond. 
In Gifford Woods State Park I took the side trail into the village of Killington. After crossing busy three lane US 4 I stopped at the Killington Deli. I bought four days of food, a steak and egg breakfast sandwich and coffee. 
Out in front of the store I packed up and ate while sitting on a bench. Afterwords it was back across the busy road and then the side trail to the AT. 
The next two miles was rocky reminding me of New Hampshire. Then a rough side trail down to the Inn at the Long Trail. This is a quaint old inn built right into the rock of the mountain. A real Irish pub worth the stop for anyone. 
It was noon and I was too early for a room but I was able to do laundry and eat again. The guy at the desk gave me clean clothes while I did laundry and said to go to the wood shed to change. Knowing they had bathrooms I wondered why I was told to use the wood shed. Anyway, I said OK and walked down beyond the motel's rooms and sheepishly pushed open a door on the end which had no door handle. Sure enough, it was the wood shed. 
I went back to the inn and did my laundry. While waiting and despite eating less than two hours ago, I had a bacon cheeseburger, cole slaw and a Coke. As I was finishing my plate the guy brought my room key. I went up and got a nice long hot shower. By 2 p.m. I was clean, my clothes were clean, and my gut full. 
I took a nap, messed with logistics, and checked out the hiker box. In the hiker box I annexed coffee, razors, bandaids, plastic bags and a pack cover. My pack cover doesn't stop the rain so I'll see if this one fits. 
For dinner I had a great blackened chicken sandwich with goat cheese, cole slaw, a Coke and Guinness. 
It is now 7:12 p.m. I am still hungry so I'll eat my potato chips and chocolate pretzels. 
Breakfast is included with the stay. Hope to be on the trail by 9 a.m. Looks like Massachusetts in five or six days. Nobos have been saying horrible muddy conditions south of Rt 11 and 30. That's about three days south. Hopefully better weather will reduce or eliminate that problem.
The trail has been going in a southwest direction pretty much. Tomorrow, after the AT merges with the Long Trail, the route begins heading more due south through the rest of Vermont, Massachusetts, and most of Connecticut.","Quimby Mountain, VT

Afterwards I went back to my room, had my fourth shower, and packed gear. I left the inn and headed up the side trail arriving at the AT at about 9:30. 
The AT seemed to go around the mountain before merging with the Long Trail. Then down the mountain and across Rt 4. 
The climb up Killington Peak is an ascent of 2,020 feet. But taking around six miles to get there it was easy and pleasant. I arrived at the shelter called Cooper Lodge, at 2:30. The shelter is at 3,900' but a side trail goes to the top of Killington at 4,241'. There were a lot of people there and on the side trail up, perhaps the people doing the 4,000 footers. 
I continued on the AT which was good hiking for a few miles. A one mile section was difficult, bringing flashbacks of the White Mountains. But the trail improved and a good treadway to Governor Clement shelter. 
At the dark dirty spooky stone shelter I retrieved the trail register. I looked back a month but could not locate any of the names of hikers I had known before I got sick. That made me sad. But they might not have stopped here so who knows. 
Leaving the shelter the trail was in exceptionally good condition. It passed through open forests with plenty of high pines. The pine needle laden trail also went by several old stone walls from old farms. I could constantly hear Sargent Brook rushing down below to my left. 
At the road I crossed the new Sargent Brook Bridge. In 2011 this valley was devastated from back to back tropical storms. In 2012 I carefully crossed the creek here over the mangled steel of the old bridge. 
The trail stayed above the creek for a mile and a half. I followed a long mound with Gould Brook on my left and Sargent Brook on my right. As I descended to near where the brooks met I saw a campsite and stopped. This was my goal for the day. 6:30 p.m.","The Inn at the Long Trail, VT

After a tough drop down to Claredon Gorge the trail climbed. Great views of the Rutland area. Then a long drop to Rt 103 via long switchbacks.  
Across the road the trail climbed and briefly followed waterfall laced Bully Brook. After crossing the brook I stopped for water. 
Another long climb and I stopped near Greenwall Shelter Trail. My goal for the day was 20 miles but the ups and downs were slimming my chances. I thought I could still make it. 
Then the trail became Maine-like with rocks, roots, and mud. I realized I wasn't going to make my goal. My foot with the corn was painful with every step. Finally I stopped. 
I took the bandages off my foot. I had bandaged it twice today. I also figured I could make my secondary goal at Little Rock Pond. As I started walking the foot was better as well as my attitude. 
Though the trail was tough I was about to dodge the obstacles. Once over the top of the mountain the trail improved. 
I went by the pay-to-stay shelter at Little Rock Pond just before 7 p.m. I continued for 20 minutes to make sure I was out of their jurisdiction and stopped. It was a tough day physically and mentally but I am happy with the results.","Gould Brook

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601510,"Rain overnight and early this morning. I packed up in a lull and was on the trail at 7:30. Rain continued all morning. 
Despite the rain the hiking was good all day. Though slippery and muddy the grade was mild enough to enjoy the day. I was making good time. 
I stopped at Peru Peak shelter around 1 as the rain stopped. I made coffee to help propel me. I talked with three people going north on the Long Trail. 
I continued hiking hoping everything would dry out.  The trail continued with a good grade.  There were three mountains to go over today. Baker was easy. Peru Peak had a short climb on rocks then a descent on rocks but nothing slowing my pace much. 
At about 3:30 it poured! It was a torrential downpour. I didn't attempt to get my raincoat out fearing everything would get soaked. Fortunately I had the pack cover on and my rain hat on. The rain was cold and I worried about hypothermia but I continued. The path I was descending on was a muddy torrent. After 20 minutes the rain stopped. 
I just continued hiking in the mud and puddles. Then the trail climbed Brimley Mountain, the steepest climb of the day. Got to the top at 5 p.m. Then a descent right down a ski slope for half a mile and into the woods. 
The descent continued on the trail. I came to the side trail to Brimley Shelter after 6 p.m. I found the solo tent pad and put my gear on top then descended a trail for water. It went way down the hill. 
When I found the water source I filled two bottles. Then I heard it coming...rain. I rushed up to the tent pad and my unprotected gear was now wet. Thinking quickly I grabbed everything and headed for the shelter. I don't like shelters too much but tonight it's a must.","Little Rock Pond
",Brimley Shelter,"Aug 22, Wed",17.60
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601565,"Cold this morning. I waited until I heard someone else move and make noise then I got up. Took a while but got out of the toasty sleeping bag. Packed up and put wet shoes on. Left at 7:30. 
About a mile down the trail at a rock with some sun I heated water for coffee. Then heated water for a shave and to wash my hair. A town day so no greasy hair, I needed some fluff. 
Took rain gear off and put my wet clothes on then headed the next mile to the road. At the road I hid my trekking poles and took my vest and long sleeve shirt off. I was in the sun and it was warm. 
I originally was going to go east to the Bromley Deli but at the last minute decided to go the other way into Manchester. I began to hitch when a vehicle from Manchester direction pulled in and dropped off some hikers. He signaled me over and offered me a ride into town. He owns the hostel there. 
He dropped me off at McDonald's and I thanked him. I went in and ordered the Big Breakfast with Pancakes...1,330 calories. The woman said I meant ""hotcakes."" I said OK. I ordered coffee with extra cream and one sugar. She said the standard for coffee is three creams and three sugars. I said OK, a little perplexed. She gave me the receipt and said I could go online and tell how wonderful she was today. Again, perplexed, I just said OK. 
Afterwards I went to Price Chopper then to the laundromat. While doing laundry my shoes were out basking in the sun in the parking lot. Inside was Beaver who I met back at Smarts Mtn. He had caught up with his dad who also is hiking the trail. 
Before leaving town I went and got a quarter pounder at McDonald's before heading out. I had another clerk. 
I walked out of the town of outlet stores and a car stopped. Hiker Gnome, who hiked in 2017, offered me a ride back to the trail! She is from Helen, Georgia, which is right near the trail and said to call if I needed anything when I'm in the area. 
She dropped me off and I thanked her for her kindness. I retrieved my trekking poles then went to the road and waited for traffic to clear.  A truck pulled in right in front of me and asked if I needed a ride to Manchester. I said no but told them how grateful I was for them stopping and asking. 
I got across the busy road with no problem. I was very happy for the rides today and I was back on the trail and it was only 12:15! 
The trail climbed but was steady. A woman in her late 60's came hiking in the opposite direction and we talked. She hikes every weekend and lives nearby. Pat was very pleasant to talk to. She said the trail is bad near Stratton Pond. Instead of calling the state Vermont she said it should be called Vermud. 
The trail was good for about five miles. After veering off a dirt road I noticed it really got muddy. A young man coming the other way asked me when the mud ended. He seemed depressed with the situation. I was glad to give him a good report that it's just a few minutes to better trail. He said it was terrible for the last four or five miles. 
As I continued another young man came by. He is doing the Long Trail and it's his first solo hike. He was very upbeat. He said the trail is bad but he just walks right through it. I could tell because mud was nearly up to his knees. He also said four or five miles of mud. 
I kept going and was maneuvering pretty well around the mud holes. It was as bad as Pat and the two young men said. But as I got to the bridge at Winhall River at 5:45 my feet were dry and only about one inch of mud on either side. 
I camped within sight of the bridge. I had to dry out my tent as it was still wet from yesterday morning. 
A very good day indeed. Good to be dry. Tomorrow I think I will wear the empty bagel bags over my socks just in case the mud gets worse.","Brimley Shelter
",Winhall River,"Aug 23, Thu",10.60
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601611,"On the trail at 6:34 this morning. After crossing the Winhall River Bridge it was mud. The mud was on and off. Big long holes and small ones. But it was easy navigating them because over the weeks the hikers made their detours and I only had to follow. 
Nothing terrible where I was told it was terrible which was around Stratton Pond. The pond was beautiful early in the morning. 
It was a climb to the top of Stratton Mountain.  On top of the 3,936' mountain is a fire tower and the views were outstanding. It was 10 a.m. 
At the base of the fire tower I took a break even making coffee. Green Machine was there. He passed me way back but took time off in Hanover with his folks. 
The trail dropped off the mountain steadily. After crossing Stratton-Arlington Road the trail became problematic. The mud holes became much longer and the trail became much more rocky and root-bound. I had no problem and just kept going. 
After Story Springs Shelter the sloppy trail was discouraging me. It was just messy. 
But I came to Kid Gore Shelter at 5:45 and was glad my day was over. Though I did not make my goal of Glastenbury Mountain I made my second choice. I was glad to see I did a 17 mile day.
So, despite the mud, which wasn't as bad as I expected, it was a productive day. 
Also, I am now beyond 25% of the way. Looks like Massachusetts on Sunday.","Winhall River

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601696,"Warm out when I got up this morning. Sun just coming over the ridge when I left camp at 6:39. 
Stopped at the fire tower on Glastenbury Mountain, 3,748', around 9. Usually can see the Adirondack Mountains of New York but it was cloudy in that direction. 
Great hiking almost all day. Trail was good with only a few muddy spots. 
I crossed Vt. 9 around 3:30. But the trail soon changed. There were a few hundred rock steps to climb and they were steep. But once on top of the hill the trail leveled out. For a few miles the trail was good but then descended on an eroded old road. Water and rocks and sometimes mud and roots. Sometimes all of those at the same time. 
Mosquitoes became bothersome. Then the trail crossed a creek and it became all mud. Came to the shelter at 6:08, way earlier than expected. 
Despite the last few miles being in poor condition, today was a great hiking day. Weather was good and most of the trail was good. Also crossed the last mountain in Vermont over 3,000'. Now only Mt. Greylock and Saddle Ball Mountain in Massachusetts and that's the last 3,000 footers until southern Virginia. Speaking of Massachusetts, the border is only 10 miles away.","Kid Gore shelter

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601749,"On trail at 6:35 this morning. Sun coming up through the trees. Looks like a great day. 
Trail was very good throughout the day. Two high mud holes made me think how to get around them with the best way just bushwhacking through the woods. Several vistas on the way but all were overgrown. 
At 12:50 I came to the border and plunged into Massachusetts. I thought about smearing mud on the Vermont sign but I was so happy to leave the state I forgot. 
Two young women asked me to take their picture in front of the signs. This was the beginning of the Long Trail for them. The Long Trail is concurrent with the AT for over 100 miles then continues northward to the Canadian Border. I've been seeing a lot of people heading north on the LT. 
Leaving the Long Trail there should be fewer hikers. Also, Nobos on the AT only have around six weeks to get to Mt. Katahdin so we are seeing fewer and fewer of them. The mountain closes October 15. 
I continued on the trail pressing to get into town. There was a long rocky drop but after that all was fine. 
It became humid again it seemed. I was sweating pretty bad. I stopped at a stream to rinse off and wash my hair. Its a town day and I need that fluffy look. I shaved last night. 
I got into town around 3 but went the wrong way. I knew what was in both directions but I thought I was going to a new store. The map does not have North arrow on it and I disoriented myself. 
When I realized my mistake I turned around and headed back. Round trip, I wasted a mile. Then I went the other direction and came to Super Stop and Shop. I was here six years ago. I should have remembered. 
I got a few items to make it to Dalton on Tuesday. I went outside and packed it away except for the big Italian sub. I took that out of the plastic container and placed it in a grocery bag. On the .4 of a mile back to the trail route I ate the sub while walking down the busy highway. It was luscious. 
At the red light I re-caught the trail route and headed up through an old residential neighborhood. It was about 4:30 p.m. Many of the homes had Old Glory displayed. 
The street got steeper and steeper. It was hot and I was sweating pretty good. I was hoping the Italian sub, the Coke, and the Powerade I consumed would all remain in place. Suddenly the trail turned left into the woods. All was safe. 
Earlier I looked up at the mountains on this side of town and thought the trail probably does not go up to the top...but it did. 
The trail climbed for about two miles but was well built and had many switchbacks. I was soaked in sweat. 
Just before 7 p.m. I came to a vista overlooking North Adams. The sun was low, offering a few hints of sunset colors. The mountains all around the city stood tall and were tinted with haze. 
Calamity came by, a Nobo. We talked for 15 minutes. He hopes to reach Katahdin the first week of October. 
Calamity headed north and I headed south taking one last look at the developing sunset. 
The woods seemed dark after watching the sky but my eyes adjusted quickly. 
I came to the Money Brook Trail to Wilbur Clearing Shelter. I went .3 to the shelter, got water, then quickly set up a short distance away. 7:45 p.m.  I can hear the wind and an owl. A big difference from the cars and motorcycles in town. 
Tomorrow Mt. Greylock and Saddle Ball Mountain early. They are the last 3,000 footers until somewhere in the Shenandoahs. 
A good day today.","Congdon Shelter, VT

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601815,"It was a warm beautiful morning. No one else at the shelter area showed any signs of life when I left. On the trail at 6:58. 
Not a bad hike to Mt Greylock save the last half mile. But I was up on top about 9:30. The views were great. Some fog drifted around the Massachusetts War Memorial. 
I walked down to the Bascom Lodge for a $3 cup of coffee. It was strong, apparently high octane, but it was good. 
I headed out after 10. It would be a long but easy drop to Rt 8 in eight miles. Aside from three mud holes the trail was in good shape. Mosquitoes were abundant which reminded me I was supposed to get bug spray in Williamstown yesterday but forgot. 
Before Rt 8 the trail went through multiple mowed fields offering distant views of the mountains ahead. 
At Rt 8 there was a Dollar General in sight. I stopped for four days of food and bug spray. It was the largest Dollar General I've ever seen. I was in hiker heaven. The clerk even said ""Welcome to the Cadillac of all Dollar Generals."" 
I headed back to the trail which passed between houses and then a six foot wide path through tall corn. The path led onto a residential street that had US flags on each power pole. 
Then I stopped in Cheshire at Diane's Twist for ice cream and a chili dog. It was hot out and she warned me it is to be in the 90s the next two days. 
Green Machine and Fay, who passed me earlier, came over and sat at the picnic tables with me. A boy about 12 handed me an address book. He asked for our trail names and contact info. He said he guides hikers in town and has been doing it for three years. He said his trail name is North Star since he guides hikers through town. He also said the local newspaper recently did an article about him assisting hikers. 
Everyone left so I packed up. It was hot. I headed down the street and up a side street going up a hill. The hill and heat reminded me of yesterday. Just as hot but the street not so steep. Ice cream, a chili dog, and Powerade, all settling fine. 
The trail entered the woods then climbed a short steep section to the ""Cobbles."" I was soaked in sweat. I dropped my pack and walked out to the views. 
Way below was Cheshire. Way out I could see Mt. Greylock and the towers on top. 
I retrieved my pack and continued. The trail was decent and feature a little rock and roll. 
Green Machine was coming towards me. He had put out his rain fly to dry back in town and now was going the almost four miles back to get it. I felt bad for him and tried to encourage him but he was upbeat about it. He said he'll stay at the church and head out in the morning. He is so fast I'm sure I'll see him tomorrow. 
At Gore Pond I almost stopped but concern about drinking pond water pushed me on. It was a beautiful area but I needed water, good water. 
I came to Crystal Mountain Campsites and went up the hill. It was just after 7 p.m. Only Fay was camped there. 
I found a secluded site and dropped my pack. As I turned around the sun was a big orange ball glowing through the trees. It was such a beautiful hot August sunset. 
I quickly got water down a side trail, rinsed off some, and returned to the camp. After setting my tent up I took my food bag to the metal bear box. When I opened it I could see that mice had chewed previous food supplies in there and it smelled of mice pee. I decided I'd take my chances with the bear. I haven't bear bagged yet. 
Back at my tent I looked at the sunset and listened to a barred owl calling hidden somewhere in the woods. What a beautiful night.","Wilbur Clearing shelter, MA

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601841,"On trail at 6:50. I don't know how I did it but made it 3.8 miles to Dalton at 8:20. Maybe the sign's mileage was wrong. 
I kept walking into town and stopped at the Dalton Diner. I had a meat lover's omelet, hash browns and coffee. 
A man there said I could go across the street to the community center and get a shower for a donation. I was hoping he was being helpful rather than me being stinky. 
I went across to the center and told the woman at the desk I'd like to get a shower. She said the showers and towels are free but they do accept donations as she she repeatedly hit the donation box hard with her index finger. The box said $3 so I ""donated."" 
After the shower I headed east to the Dalton Laundry. I wanted to wash my muddy socks. While waiting I went to the Dalton General Store for chocolate milk. It was hot out. I was sweating since I left the community center. And a laundromat is no place to cool down. 
After doing laundry I stopped again at the general store. I wanted to use up my change from the laundromat. I got two liters of Powerade (looked at the bottle to finally spell it right). Then back to the main street and up a side street, once again walking uphill in the heat. I think this is three days in a row now. 
At the last street up the hill is a hardware store, L.P. Adams. They give free denatured alcohol and Coleman fuel to hikers. I filled my bottle with the denatured alcohol then went in and thanked them. 
A hot walk across the parking lot and up the dead end street. As I crossed the railroad tracks a Nobo came down the hill and said it's really muddy. As I went on I found he was correct. A very muddy section for half a mile then all was good again. 
Sweating badly as I went over the first hill I was happy to drop to a stream. There was a pool of water calling my name. I was in and under. I wanted to cool down my core temperature. After a few minutes I got dressed and continued, feeling a bit cooler. 
The trail climbed but nothing bad. Up high there was a breeze but it was a hot breeze. 
Up over somewhat open fern-covered Warner Hill. The sun was hot but I was amazed with the view. I could see back to Mt. Greylock which now seemed so far away. It was draped in a haze. 
A mile or so later I saw a campsite and just after that I saw a stream. The unnamed stream was my destination I saw in the book. I definitely wanted water to wash off and drink. 
I hesitated for a while. The Cookie Lady is in two more miles. She gives out cookies to hikers. Plus they sell ice cream. But it was so hot and already 5 pm. Two more miles is another hour. I put my pack on not knowing which way I was going to go then I turned back to the campsite I saw. I guess my subconscious took control and wisely because when I dropped my gear I felt lightheaded. 
I went back to the creek for water. After dumping two liters over my head and filling them for water I slipped and fell in. The creek wasn't deep so now I had some mud on me. Rinse off again and get more water. I felt clumsy and refreshed at the same time. 
Tomorrow will be a short day due to the heat. I'll go to the AMC cabin at Upper Goose Pond. A good spot to swim and canoe on a hot day. In the mornings the caretaker makes pancakes for the hikers. Maybe, like back at McDonald's, they are hotcakes. We'll find out Thursday morning.","Crystal Mountain Campsites

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601930,"Barred owls calling as I woke this morning. Another warm morning. The birds were singing as I packed up. I headed out just before 7 a.m. as the sun was coming up over the eastern ridge. 
It was warm and soon I was sweating. Since I got a late start I decided to stop at the Cookie Lady's house. Not so much for cookies but for water. 
I arrived about 8. Cars were in the open garage but no activity. I got two liters of water and annexed a military hydration powder someone left in the hiker box. 
I signed the register and waited. Finally I headed back to the trail and continued cookieless. 
The trail had its mud today but nothing terrible. I stopped at October Mountain shelter. There was Andrew. I met him in the 100 mile wilderness in Maine. He walks shelter to shelter and stays a day or two. He was ahead of me because he skipped a few states. I wrote in the register that today there is a heat advisory and a mud advisory. 
As I continued I saw plenty of tea colored water coming out of beaver ponds. No way was I drinking or swimming in there. One pond the trail stayed above and I could see it was a large pond. The trail dipped down to it once but it was muddy access so I continued. Then the trail swung away and I wished I had gotten in. 
A short distance later I crossed an old grass road, Finerty Trail, that went downhill; I assumed correctly it was downhill to the pond. I dropped my gear and followed the road, took a quick left on another and I was at the pond; Finerty Pond according to the book. 
As I started to go into the water the rocks were sharp. Then I tripped and went head first into the water at a deep spot. Though I went under I didn't hit any rocks. Again, like yesterday, I felt clumsy and refreshed. 
Back at my pack I got dressed and headed up Becket Mountain. Steep at first but a refreshing breeze on top. 
Dropping down I crossed Tyne Road and found the first good water since the Cookie Lady's. I rationed what I had from her house since this morning. 
Dropping still, I crossed US 20 and then separate bridges over the westbound and eastbound lanes of I-90. It was hot there as it was in the open and twice I was walking along the interstate about 20 feet from the guardrail and the loud traffic. 
A steep climb up the mountain. I was soaked in sweat. Shortly I hit the .5 mile side trail to Upper Goose Pond Cabin. It was 3:36. 
At the cabin was Steamer, who jumped ahead because he did that section last year, and Beaver. Beaver actually was across the pond getting about 20 gallons of water at a spring for the cabin. 
The caretaker and her two friends were there as well as two big Irish Wolfhounds. I went out back and got a campsite near Steamer""s and Beaver's tent. 
Beaver came into the dock and unloaded the water. Later I went down and carried a bunch of the jugs of water up the hill to the cabin. Some others helped as well as Beaver. This is something done nearly everyday and everyone is expected to help. 
Later I went down to the pond and jumped in hoping to rinse all the sweat out of my clothes. I was refreshed and didn't fall in this time. The pond is more like a lake. It is preserved forever. A channel goes out to another lake which has houses surrounding it and motorboats. This lake only electric motors are permitted. 
A good day though the heat made it tough. Sometimes I wasn't sure if I wanted to push on with the humidity and the heat. But I made it and happy and grateful for such a beautiful place.

Packed up and at the nearby cabin at 7:10. Pancakes were already being served. There were only four of us at the table. Bambi (her real name) was the volunteer caretaker and the cook. She's around 60, white hair, and a friendly personality. 
Sitting in the quaint room with a fireplace and American chestnut wood floors were Bambi""s friend, Stephanie from Washington and Marilynn from Montana. 
I had to ask the question: are these pancakes or hotcakes? I mentioned my McDonald's lady story. Well, that got into a good discussion with all. Bambi finally settled the discussion with the fact that these are regional words for the same thing. I was happy and ate my flapjacks. 
Later I thanked Bambi and her friends for the hospitality and headed out. I was on the AT at 8:30. 
The trail was tame most of the day. In the morning the sun was in and out and sometimes I was sure it would rain, but nothing. As the day wore on it became hot. 
After Tyringham Road the trail went across wetlands sometimes on long dilapidated boardwalks. Sometimes the boards sank into the water. Even the bears weren't happy with the conditions of the boardwalk. They had left a significant amount of scat on the walkway as a protest. 
Near the end of the walkway I looked back. Ten years ago a farmer was plowing these fields as I went by and waved. Now all is overgrown. 
I came to Jerusalem Road. There a farmer has a little building, self-serve, next to the road and sells items to the hikers. Beaver's father was there resting as he was stung by a bee on the shoulder. I drank two Cokes as I charged my phone on the provided outlets. I got water across the road from the farm house at a spring with a pipe. I wrote a thank you note in the register. 
I went back to the trail and entered Tyringham Cobble. It seems to be a park with trails and views. 
The afternoon was hot. Up one hill I was sweating pretty badly. I had to take several breaks.
Once on top of the mountains there was a good breeze. The trail even was good. A bunch of Nobos went by which may be the last of them...unless they are really fast. 
I came into Mt. Wilcox Shelter just after 6 p.m. Mr. Mesi and two companions were there. I saw them at Upper Goose Cabin this morning, the first I've seen them since Monson. They were pushing into Great Barrington tonight. 
A very ancient shelter here and a newer one nearby. I checked out the newer one but kept hearing this loud banging noise. I guess no one considered the consequences of building a shelter with a steel roof under oak trees. 
I don't stay in shelters usually anyway so I went up to the tenting area. Very odd, two shelters here and I am all alone. Very quiet...except for a few acorns now and then. 
Tomorrow it will be 12 miles to Great Barrington. I need food and Gorilla Glue for my right shoe. The sole is coming off and my only field expedient method for repair is my waterproof bandage tape.","Upper Goose Pond, MA

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602117,"Just after I dozed off I heard a strange noise. I tried to figure out what it was but couldn't. I tried to sleep but couldn't. So, I put my headlamp on and ventured out in the dark. 
The noise seemed to be coming from the old shelter. I walked down the trail and slowly went around to the front keeping the light on the shelter at all times. There it was, the noise maker. The biggest porcupine I had ever seen chewing on the overhanging floorboards. 
Just as I chased it away a Barred owl above made a strange noise like a cat and that scared me. 
I went back to the tent. Barred owls kept calling, some sounding strange like a giant cat.  Not long after I got in my tent the chewing began again. The Barred Owls calling, the porcupine chewing, and the acorns hitting the steel roof of the new shelter. I think that will keep the bears away. 
This morning I was up before 5. I set up my Vargo stove just outside my tent. I used the moonlight to fill the stove with denatured alcohol. Then I made coffee as I enjoyed the warm morning and the moonlight. By the time I was making my second cup of coffee clouds came in and the moonlight was gone. 
Using my headlamp I packed up and got on the trail at 5:58 a.m. The day was just awakening. 
I pushed hard all morning to get to Great Barrington. I estimated I'd get there around 1 p.m. The trail was pretty good and I seemed to be making good time. The entire day was cloudy. 
I met Grace, a trail volunteer, at the Tom Leonard Shelter. She backpacked in to check the trail and clean up the shelter. Then, separately, two Nobos. One said he didn't think he'd make it to Katahdin before the park closes and wasn't too concerned about it. The other is pushing hard and is sure he'll make it. 
At the bridge over the Housatonic River I saw two guys from Pennsylvania. They were waiting for a group of guys that have been hiking the AT in sections for 16 years. They were finishing up this year's trip at the bridge and I met them shortly after I left. 
I got to US 7 right around 1 p.m. Since it was only 1.5 miles to the Big Y grocery store I decided to not hitch. But trail angel Melissa saw me and took me to the store. 
I got four days of food and an Italian sub. I also got duct tape for my shoe that is coming apart. As I left the shopping center I saw an Aubuchon Hardware store and went in. I asked for Gorilla Glue. The guy saw my shoe and said I need Shoe Goo. I went outside to glue and tape my shoe. 
On the walk down the highway I ate the Italian sub and drank a Dr. Pepper. My exaggerated limping got no sympathy so I ended up walking all the way to the trail. On the trail at 2:40, which I was happy about. 
The trail went through some bogs. The mosquitoes were horrible, much worse than Maine. The trail went by the 1787 Shays Rebellion monument. Then through and along farmland. I saw cows and sheep. 
As I came to Jug End Road the book said east on road .25 miles to water but the sign said .1. I went down the road looking and saw a dry creek so went on. I finally turned around and headed back. Then I saw a pool of water and reluctantly filled one liter up. As I headed back to the trail I investigated the dry creek. As I went into the woods I saw water! It went naturally underground way before the road. I dumped out the yucky water and got two clean liters. 
Back at the trail I headed up Jug End Mountain. It was rocky and steep. After 45 minutes the worst was over. I saw a campsite but continued. After 10 minutes of more climbing and no campsites I returned back downhill to the one I saw earlier. Time was 6:30. 
After getting in the tent and darkness came I was blessed with a sound, one of my favorites and the first time I heard them this year: Katydids. I hear Katydids above me and crickets around me. Sweet sounds to fall asleep to.","Mt. Wilcox South Shelter

Near Mt. Race I ran into several groups of hikers young and old. Many open ledges with lots of beautiful views. 
Dropped into Sages Ravine and crossed into Connecticut right at 1 p.m. Followed the trail upstream then found a pool of water and I was in. 
Long tough climb up Bear Mountain similar to climbing in the White Mountains. On top there were more people than pigeons on a silo. Bear Mountain is the highest peak in Connecticut and it is a holiday weekend so lots of folks out. (Bear Mountain is the highest peak in Connecticut but not the highest land. Figure that one out.) 
After a steep drop off the mountain, the trail was awesome all the way to Lions Head. Beautiful trail on an old road lined with Mountain Laurel. 
A bit steep up Lions Head and steep down some but then good trail all the way into Salisbury. 
I walked the .4 mile into the well-to-do little town. I stopped at LeBonne's Market and got an Italian sub. I sat on a bench outside trying to eat it. The meat was a solid inch thick and the bun was real tough Italian bread. It was luscious! I couldn't eat it all so I packed it away and headed back to the trail. 
As I was walking I called Heartrock. While talking I was on a four foot paved berm up against the lawns of houses. While not using my trekking poles I carry them in my right hand waist high and on a 45 degree angle to my body. 
A woman coming down the street in her maroon truck or sUV going about 35 mph, crossed the white line towards me and hit my trekking poles. They swung around hitting me on the right back side. Heartrock even heard the bang on the phone. I wasn't hurt but the lady didn't stop. Nice dent on the one trekking pole. Nothing I could do and thankfully no injury so I continued. 
It was getting late. The trail left the road and went steeply up the mountain. I stopped twice to finish eating that sandwich. A little after 7 p.m. I saw a flat area and stopped for the day. As I was setting up the tent the sun was shining bright on me just as it was hitting the top of a neighboring ridge. A Barred Owl called in the distance and thousands of insects are singing me to sleep. No katydids here though.","Jug End Mountain

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602336,"I usually have a song for each day but seldom mention it. Yesterday, the first day of September, it's mandatory I play yearly ""September Morn"" but I forgot to write it in the journal entry. So, that's the song for September 1st: ""September Morn. We danced until the night became a brand new day..."" I'll tell you today's song in a minute. 
On the trail at 6:51. I had a great start to hiking today because the trail stayed pretty contour until Prospect Mountain. I had no water for coffee this morning only Powerade. So, I got water along the way and made coffee at Prospect Mountain while sitting on a rock outcrop. 
About 15 trail runners came up the mountain walking going north. They stopped at the view near me to take selfies. I happened to ask if they ran Escarpment Race in New York. Practically every one did. I mentioned I ran it for 20+ years before I hurt my knee. They threw out familiar names I knew: Ben Nephew, Rick Fargo...yes, I knew those guys. 
We talked a bit. I said I miss running Escarpment, the ""Run in the Sky."" One guy said ""But look what you're doing now. You're still going!"" I thank him for that comment. They all took off running and I felt sad. 
There's where my song for today came in. ""Those were the days my friend. We thought they'd never end. We'd sing and dance forever and always..."" 
Off down the mountain, through some fields, by the hydro dam, and to the Toymaker, a restaurant. Another Sobo, Habib, came in behind me. We never met. We ordered breakfast and sat at a table talking. 
I ordered the hash brown platter. For $9 I got a big plate of potatoes, scrambled eggs, two large sausage patties, toast and coffee. It was superbly luscious. 
After breakfast we both headed out separately. He does bigger miles than I do so probably won't see him again. 
Back on the trail through park-like woods, across the Housatonic River then up the mountain. The trail wound through the woods for a few hours then dropped steeply to West Cornwall Road. After that it went back up, through a boulder field, then down to a stream. 
I met a couple there who asked how far it was to Caesar Brook Campsite. Unfortunately I had to tell them that was where I was headed and they passed it a mile and a half ago. They headed back south. I passed by them at a place with about 100 rock steps. 
At 6:40 I came to Caesar Brook. After crossing and checking out the campsites, I backtracked across the creek and set up camp. 20 minutes later the couple I turned back came in. 
I told them I felt so bad for them especially having to go back up those steps. I said sometime at home you can laugh about it. The guy said someone's never going to let him forget it and she smiled. 
I took a hot bottle shower and got in the tent. I heard Barred Owls again. They must be following me. Also today, I saw my first deer, a button buck 15 feet away from me and it didn't run. The only other big game animal I've seen is the teen moose in Maine. I saw a black squirrel two days ago which was interesting. 
Bed time. Forest critters singing away loudly. Beautiful night  Those were the days my friend. We'd thought they'd never end...","South of Salisbury, CT

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602393,"Up and on the trail at 6:18. A steep climb right away and it wasn't long until I was soaked in sweat. The trail dropped to Guinea Brook then up again. I don't remember Connecticut being so tough. It must be the heat and humidity. 
The trail dropped to the Housatonic River and followed it for over four beautiful miles. At first it was in the full sun, which was hot, then mostly in the woods and cooler. Occasionally a breeze cooled the air. 
The trail weaved through a few mowed fields along the river. Stacks of hay or straw were at the end of each field. Then the trail followed an old road along the river with old stone walls along the upper side to my right. The river was always on my left. 
I took a dip on the river to cool off. I kept my body under the water to cool my core temperature. But too soon it was back on the trail and back to sweating. 
I stopped in upscale Kent. I got water treatment at Backcountry Outfitters then went to do laundry. I really needed to charge my phone. A young guy there gave me soap for my clothes. A woman, Jean, told me to throw in my wet clothes into one of the many dryers she was using to save me the $2 fee. Her husband has symptoms like MS but the doctor ruled that out. Now she is washing everything in her house because they suspect it's the tick and flea collars on the dogs they have been causing the strange nerve reactions. She was very pleasant and we wished each other success. 
I went back to the outfitter and got a milkshake and a $5 hot dog. Well, the milkshake was good. 
Then back up the road to the trail. It was hot and some of the tar on the road was sticky. 
I hiked up to Mt. Algo Shelter which wasn't far. 10 backpacks were there but no humans. I figured college kids doing their orientation week though I don't know what that means. 
I decided to continue 2.9 miles to the next campsite thinking it shouldn't be tough...it was tough. I was soaked climbing several hills. 
At 6:20 I turned up the blue blaze trail to Schaghticoke Mountain Campsites. There were college kids doing their orientation week. They were friendly. 
I set up camp, got water and in my tent at 7 p/m. A long, hot, humid day. Lots of fireworks bangs at the moment. The kids are quiet and the trees are singing. No Barred Owl tonight. 
Tomorrow the trail enters New York state. Also I should be at the 1/3 point of the trip in the morning.","Caesar Brook

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602467,"Warm overnight. Moonlight this morning through the trees. I packed up and got on the trail at 6:18. 
It was a tough climb up Schaghticoke Mountain but the orange growing glow on the ridge to my east kept my attention. I was near the top when the sun crested the neighboring ridge. A beautiful morning. Fog hug in some of the valleys below. 
Then the trail was excellent staying contoured for miles, almost the whole way to Bull's Bridge. 
I hiked into the village of Bull's Bridge over the old covered Bull's Bridge. At the Bull's Bridge Country Store I got a breakfast sandwich and coffee plus food for today and tomorrow. I remembered the owner from 2012, a helpful and pleasant woman. 
I sat on the outside picnic table in the dwindling shade. I ate my sandwich and a Drumstick (ice cream). 
I got a Coke to go and headed back to the trail.   On the trail I met River, a Nobo. He says he knows he won't make Katahdin in time but will finish next year. He was happy and content. 
I continued on the trail above the Housatonic River to the bridge over 10 Mile River. Just up that river I jumped in to cool off. 
Up over 10 Mile Hill crossing a few roads. At 12:23 I entered New York State. I had a cold hamburger from the store that I ate in celebration. 
Not too far into New York I saw another stream. Wasn't long until I was under water cooling off. It was hot again today. 
The afternoon was indeed hot. The trail was good with mild ups and downs. After Pawling Nature Reserve the trail went through open farm fields. The sun was very hot. I crossed a stile into a field of cattle resting in the shade they found. Their eyes followed me until the next stile which led me into a neighboring farm field. No cattle there and I crossed another stile and a road. There in a big plastic tub were gallons of water provided by trail angel Carolyn. I thought they'd be warm but they weren't. I was very happy. 
I drank what I had and got two liters. Then I continued and crossed NY 22. Just beyond the highway is a train platform. Metro North has an Appalachian Trail train stop. Some do venture into New York City as part of their hike. 
I continued over a long boardwalk through a wetland. Grasses, cattails, and pink flowers lined the route. Some were eight feet high. 
At the end I followed the trail a short distance then stopped a few miles shy of my goal for the day. It was just too hot. AccuWeather says 88 degrees locally. It was 5:38 p.m.","Schaghticoke Mountain, CT
",Near NY Highway 22,"Sep 04, Tue",15.30
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602589,"Before bed I couldn't stand the sweat so I walked back to the boardwalk with an empty water bottle. At the only place the water looked good I reached down and scooped up some water. I dumped it over my head then repeated. I felt much better. 
As I walked back down the boardwalk to my tent there were hundreds of dragonflies flying in all directions in the darkening blue sky above me. To the west a few purple clouds hung in the sky as the sun's brightness faded. What a beautiful night. 
I was awake this morning before 5 a.m. I love train horns and I had my share overnight as it seemed Metro North ran up and down that single track almost every hour. 
Using my headlamp I reached the trail right on 6 a.m. I wanted to beat the heat. I proclaimed a heat emergency which meant as much swimming as possible. 
The day quickly brightened as I walked through wet fields. I even saw four deer early, sharing the same field. 
Soon I walked by the Dover Oak. Its girth is 20 feet 4 inches. The oak is estimated to be 300 years old. 
I stopped at Telephone Pioneer Shelter and treated water. I went by Nuclear Lake as the temperature was creeping higher but decided not to swim. I was low on food and needed to get to the deli near Stormville plus beat the afternoon heat. 
At Morgan Stewart Shelter I arrived at 11:45, ahead of my estimate. However I wasn't feeling my best. I walked down the hill to the handpump where I met a 75+ year old woman. She said her name is Badass Betty. 
I pumped the water for her and she did the same for me. Then we went back up to the shelter. A guy from West Virginia I saw back at Telephone Pioneer shelter came in. I didn't get his name. Both of them are going to RPH shelter which is a long hot way. My goal was just to get to the deli. 
Well, Badass Betty took off and I didn't see her the rest of the day. The other guy I saw at I-84 where someone left water. Then I lost him because I was going to the deli. 
I arrived at Rt 52 about 2:23 and hiked up the highway then down the highway .3 to the deli. It was in the sun and I worried about going back. 
But at the Mountain Top Market and Deli (which wasn't on top the mountain) I got a great Italian sub, two ice cream bars, a Pepsi and two days worth of food. 
Outside on the bench I ate the sub and ice cream while talking to a motorcyclist about each's time out in Idaho and Montana. 
I packed up and headed from the Mountain Top Market to the actual mountain top. It was hot. I talked with Heartrock earlier who said temperature in Stormville was 91. 
At the trail was trail magic! Trail angel Tort left water and soda IN ICE! Oh, so cold and good. 
I decided to continue to Hosner Mountain Road looking for a campsite and a stream. It was 3:45. About 5 p.m. after a sweaty 1.6 miles I came to a stream by Hosner Mountain Road. But a sign warned the stream flows through cow pastures. I didn't want to continue but near the stream were houses. On the other side of the road the trail went up. It was 5 p.m. 
I decided to leave my pack there and see if any campsites were up the hill. As I crossed the road and started the climb I saw water jugs! Tort left water here! 
I headed up the steep hill for 10 minutes and found a nice spot. So, back down to get my pack. Then, since I proclaimed a heat emergency, decided to take a gallon up the hill with me just in case. 
Going up the hill I had two liters plus a gallon, that's 12 additional pounds and it was steep. 
At 5:30 I finally settled on a location and set up camp. I used one liter to wash myself off, drank one and now have two for tomorrow. I'll shortly take any remaining water all the way back down...what was I thinking? 
Sun is setting now and all I hear is traffic on I-84 and an occasional acorn dropping. Temperature is 82 degrees.","Near NY Highway 22
",Homer Mountain Road,"Sep 05, Wed",16.30
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602626,"Breezy and warm overnight. The katydids were calling loud, just beautiful. 
Packed up and on the trail at 5:52. Used my headlamp to get to the trail. As the day started the trail hugged the west side of the mountain so I did not get to see any sunrise. It was getting hot and humid early. 
This section is great. Whoever maintains from before NY 52 on to here takes their work seriously. Years ago they had pink flamingos along the trail but were removed because they violated the ""wilderness experience"" (forget about the roar of I-84 below the trail). 
The trail went under the Taconic State Parkway along a road then dropped to RPH Shelter. There the West Virginia section hiker was just leaving. 
I used the old handpump to get two liters of rusty water. I wasn't too pleased with what I was seeing. Shenandoah Tenting Area was 1.3 miles away so I decided to continue to there. I dumped one liter out. 
When I reached Shenandoah a sign said the pump doesn't work but jugs of water may be available. I went to the picnic tables but all the containers were empty. Glad I kept the one liter of rusty water. 
About a mile away at Long Hill Road there were gallons of water provided again by Tork (I spelled the name wrong yesterday). I drank the rest of the rusty water then got two clean liters and hiked up Shenandoah Mountain. 
On top it was rocky and open. An American flag was painted on the rock surface. I went a bit further and took a break in some shade. 
A while later after the vista overlooking Canopus Lake at Fahnestock State Park the trail was rough. Lots of steep ups and downs over rock. No access to the lake. It was hot. Lots of blow downs all day. Big oaks knocked over exposing the root systems. Must have been a potent wind storm at one time recently. 
Finally crossed NY 301 and followed an old narrow gauge railroad. One side was a stone wall 10-15 feet high for a long distance. Very historically interesting. 
At 3:15 I came to Dennytown Road. A building there has a spigot on the side for hikers. I drank a liter and filled two to go. The sun was brilliant and hot. I saw a pair of trail shoes there and briefly considered annexing them. The Shoe Goo for mine lasted two days so I must wrap the one with duct tape daily. Alas, the shoes proved too small. 
Continuing on the trail I wasn't sure how far I wanted to go. It was hot and the mosquitoes pretty bad. I was low on Deep Woods Off. 
At 3:45 I heard thunder to the west. I kept going listening and watching the sky. At 4:15 I saw a real nice campsite but went on. A short time later I decided I had enough of heat, sweat, and bugs and returned to that site I saw. 
Just as I was setting up the tent a strong wind blew through blowing my ground cloth and tent a few feet away. The sun disappeared as dark clouds and thunder drew closer. I got the tent up and put today's clothes on the line. I hope the rain will rinse the sweat out. 
At 5 p.m. it rained hard. I love the sound on the tent. I could see puddles forming around me and for a short time was a bit concerned. The rain lasted half an hour. All was quiet again. The only noise is an occasional train horn down along the Hudson River and raindrops falling off the trees. A bit cooler out too. 
Tomorrow a big day. A deli in the morning (New York and New Jersey sections of the trail are called the deli run), cross the Hudson River, walk through a zoo, then climb up the rock stairs to the top of Bear Mountain with views of New York City.","Homer Mountain Road

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602667,"Warm this morning. Even when I put my wet clothes on I had hanging out all night they were warm. 
On the trail at 5:44 and used my headlamp to find the way. Lichen on the rocks and the underside of wet leaves shined like reflectors along the trail. Seems humid still but a bit cooler than yesterday. 
At 9:45 I stopped at the Graymoor Monastery. There hikers can use a pavilion and a cold shower. I needed to charge my phone. 
While the phone was charging I entered the wood shower booth by the soccer field. The water was mildly warm and it felt good to get the sweat off me. 
While waiting for my phone a truck came in across the soccer field and stopped at the two portapotties. Oh, my, whatever he was doing sent a horrible odor my way. I started to pack up. Before I was done then I turned around and the truck was gone. After a while the turbulence above the portapotties subsided and I could breath normally once again. 
I headed out at 11:15 and shortly arrived at the Appalachian Deli. I got a double-decker hamburger and steak fries. I also bought enough food to get to Vernon, New Jersey where Heartrock will meet me Monday. 
I went out to sit at one of the picnic tables next to the busy intersection. There I met Tinkerbell and Cool Man. I've read their entries at shelter registers. They are a great couple from Boise, Idaho. We talked and ate together until 1 p.m. They bought a 2 liter bottle of orange soda and we did cheers before I headed out. 
I crossed the road at 1:10. The trail was great and I was surprised how much distance I was making. I came to the Bear Mountain Bridge around 3:30. After taking pictures I crossed the huge bridge and was across at 4 p.m. I did not see Tinkerbell and Cool Man behind me. They had to get to the Fort Montgomery post office up ahead before it closed. 
While the two eastbound lanes of traffic stopped for me at the crosswalk the single and closer westbound lanes didn't for five or six cars. Finally someone did and I waved and said thank you to all drivers in the three lanes as I crossed at the toll booth. 
There the trail entered the Bear Mountain Zoo.  The only caged animals I observed were a red fox and a bobcat. The bears were in their den as a worker cleaned outside. It's not a big zoo and the animals were injured prior to their captivity. 
There were a lot of interesting forest information signs along the paved walkway. One I found interesting was that every acre in the forest receives two tons of debris from the trees every year from leaves, branches, twigs and bark. 
I left the zoo, went under an overpass, then came to Hessian Lake. After the lake the trail began a 1,150' climb up Bear Mountain in two miles. 
The trail used to be a terrible eroded climb/drop along the mountainside. Now there are steps. I counted the steps- 922 of them. But they were beautifully done. The trail was four to six feet wide and had stone walls in places. Signs described the building process. There were a lot of steps then frequent flat areas to catch one's breath. I didn't take a break going up. They did a monumental job. 
The new trail ended at the old access road to the top, though from that road to the top they are currently building steps all the way up. I followed the road then followed the old seriously eroded trail to the top. 
At the top of Bear Mountain I didn't climb the tower because the cloud ceiling was low. No views of New York City today. 
I saw a soda machine so I purchased a Coke and sat there drinking and eating my BBQ Pringles. The top of the tower was now in the clouds. 
It was chilly on top and after 6 p.m. so I needed to head out. The trail going down the south side of the mountain was narrower but in good shape. This side doesn't get the overuse as the other side from the lake does. 
The trail joined the same old access road as I hit earlier and followed it downhill. Old stone and cement walls lined the length. 
I crossed Perkins Drive then Seven Lakes Drive. Cloudy out so nightfall will be soon. 
I found a spot to camp about 7:15 p.m. I quickly set up camp and got in my tent. A long day but I did have two one hour plus breaks. 
Quiet except for the Katydids, I think a bobcat, and a train horn down by the Hudson River. Looks like I'll reach New Jersey Sunday morning.","South of Dennytown Road, NY

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602778,"I think the 900 stairs was tough on my knee causing me to not get much sleep last night. Plus I was a bit nervous camping so close to the trail. Bears walk trails and I was so close a bear might have thought my camp was a drive thru and taken a bite out of me for the road. 
On the trail at 7:44. A few sprinkles of rain before I got up. Not bad out. Cooler. 
Crossed busy Palisades Parkway's divided four lanes. Really had to watch as the cars flew by at 70 mph it seemed. What a dangerous crossing. I think it's to keep the hiker population down. 
Climbed up Black Mountain. What a view! I could see the skyline of New York City. I sat there a while taking in the view while eating spoonfuls of peanut butter. A sign back at the parkway read NYC 34 miles. 
I continued through Harriman State Park encountering many hikers and groups of hikers. Another weekend and it looks to be busy. 
After a few hours I took a road .3 miles to Lake Tiorati. There are showers there and vending machines. Near the lake a family spoke to me. They said a relative hiked the Appalachian Trail sobo last year. I told them that's what I was doing. They gave me the best trail magic I had all this trip! Spontaneous trail magic! 
The Murphy family from Long Island filled up my liter bottle with grape juice, gave me two bottles of Yoo Hoo, a bottle of Muscle Milk, a bag of Twizzles, a package of ham and a package of another meat. Wow! They made my day. 
I thanked them then went to the visitors center in the traffic circle. The showers were closed. But I did get some good food and drink thanks to the Murphy's. 
As I was filling my gut it started to rain. It was about 2 p.m. I headed up the road and onto the trail. The rain was light so I only used my pack cover and rain hat. 
About 5 p.m. the rain stopped. I came to Arden Valley Road and crossed over I-87, the NY Thruway. 
After a steep climb up Arden Mountain I looked for a campsite I remember seeing twice before. I passed by a good one and later regretted not staying there. I kept going but after an hour decided it was getting too late and stopped at 7 p.m. Looks like I'm near the Orange Turnpike. I can hear cars below and music from somewhere.

After crossing the old two lane Orange Turnpike the trail climbed. There under large white pines was a large campsite with a bed of pine needles. That was the campsite I was looking for last night. Oh well, maybe next time. 
After crossing the outlet of Little Dam Lake I took a break. Shortly White Beard came across. He is section hiking the trail. After talking he headed out and so did I, passing him shortly. 
Then I met Sobos Bobsled and her husband Treeman. With them was a girl SlowMo. They started before I did and are taking their time walking home to North Carolina. I hiked with them for about two miles then went on as they took a break. 
Two Nobos from Florida came by. They asked if I was cold walking in shorts and a sleeveless shirt. I said no because I burn hot. They were all bundled up, even had the hoods of their jackets over their heads. They said they are sure they are the last of the Nobos and plan to stop in Connecticut then finish next year. 
About 1 p.m. I reached NY 17 and headed up the hill to the Bellvale Creamery. There I got a hot fudge sundae. Afterwards I crossed the road and stopped at a hot dog vendor. For $5.50 I got two hot dogs, chips, and a Pepsi. The vendor reminded me heavy rain is coming. I had to get going and headed back to the trail. I wanted to get over Prospect Rock before the rains hit. 
The first two miles of the trail were easy and I covered them quickly. Then the route went over smooth outcrops of bedrock for a mile or so. 
Three elderly men came from the opposite direction and all said hello. The last one asked in a low voice how far it was to the road. I said three miles. He said that's comforting because one of the other guys fell and hit his head. He needs to get to the hospital he said. It's a difficult and slippery area even without the rain. 
At a high point I could see a flag on a hill about a mile away. After dropping off the rocks and going through the woods the trail began climbing again up and onto more open rock face. Then after a mile from where I first saw it, there was an American Flag on top of Prospect Rock. At 1,433' Prospect Rock is the highest place on the AT in New York. 
It was sprinkling for an hour now. The views from the mountain were beautiful but I can see the potential of rain starting at any moment. 
I continued on the trail over the rock and through the stunted pines that found cracks in the rock to grow. At 5:06 p.m. I left New York and entered New Jersey. I knelt and gave thanks then celebrated with a 50 cent bag of Fritos I got at back at the hot dog vendor. It was sprinkling lightly still. 
I headed out hoping to get two more miles in. My destination was Long House Creek. I needed water and wanted to get the tent up before the rain. 
After about 45 minutes I came to a stream but it was just dark puddles. Then another hill and the trail went down. Another stream I hoped as the rain slightly increased. I could hear it on the trees. But at the bottom just a dry rocky wash. 
Another hill and then way down. The light rain slowed. Then I saw a bridge. Water! This was Long House Creek! I crossed the bridge then found a grassy area off the trail. I got the tent up and threw all my gear in. The rain was getting steadier and heavier. 6 p.m. 
I got my two water bottles and went back to the bridge. After filling the bottles and while walking back to camp I thought what a good day I had. I pushed to get here. I had the tension of trying to beat the rain. I had the desire to cross the state line. Slight disapointment at two streams. Then, as the rain increased a stream and a campsite. And finally, got set up just as the rain became serious. A very good day.

Good hiking, lots of puddles but not so muddy like in Vermont. I never look at a puddle as a puddle but look at the reflection in the puddle. 
Came to Wawayanda Shelter. There was Habib. I met him a few days back. He was taking a zero. I made coffee. Good talking to him and a section hiker out on his first hike. 
Headed out. Meeting Heartrock around 1 p.m. Earlier I felt toasty but for a while I was cold. I warmed up after awhile. 
Before I knew it I came to Pinwheel Vista. I saw the wind pick up and knew I must be at the ridge line. 
Because of the rain and fog I didn't go to the vista but headed down the steep mountainside. It was a steep slippery rock drop. I texted Heartrock and said I'd reach the Heaven Hill Farm at 12:20. 
The route down was brutal. Again, flashbacks to New Hampshire. I was slow and precise in my descent. I didn't want to mess up now. 
Finally I got out of the rocks and onto steadier trail. 
Beautiful junipers line the trail. I mistook them for pines at first. A closer look proved they were indeed beautiful pyramidal shape junipers. 
I arrived at NJ 94 and walked the short but narrow berm distance to Heaven Hill Farm Store. 
At the store I got a coffee and two pumpkin donuts and waited for Heartrock. It was 12:17.
It rained off and on but at least it was warm. I was early. 
Heavy rain and truck traffic delayed Heartrock but she made it about 1:30. 
We went to Vernon and she suggested jalapeno pepper jack whopper at Burger King for me. It was HOT. Then we drove to the Appalachian Motel. 
Oh, so glad to get a warm shower. The motel washed my stinky smelly hiker clothes for $10. It was worth it.

Then we went to a Sneakers to Boots. I tried on several brands and finally settled on the same as I always get, Merrell Moabs. I received 10% off since I was thru hiking the Appalachian Trail. Then we took everything back to the motel. 
Around 11 a.m. we headed up County Route 517 to the AT trail crossing. We walked north on the AT across the Pochuck Boardwalk and on to NJ 94 where I ended yesterday. Of course I had to stop at Heaven Hill Farm for ice cream. Then back to the trail for today's official hike southbound. 
After crossing a stile into a meadow we walked across slippery boards all the way to another stile at a railroad. One slip and you'd either have mud or cow pie on you. On the way we saw no cows but there were plenty of geese in the field. 
Then a section through new forest. We crossed a bike trail and back to the Pochuck Creek Boardwalk. 
The boardwalk was beautiful. It weaved through the wetlands. Grasses and flowers lined the wide wooden path. A bridge over Pochuck Creek required steps up to a bridge and down again. The southern section was much longer and weaved lazily and illogically through the grasses. Finally we returned to County Route 517 where we started.

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603056,"It took me some time to pack up this morning. I had items drying in different places and I had items in two drawers. It seemed like I had more gear to pack than I had room but all went into the backpack somehow. 
Heartrock and I went to the Mixing Bowl for breakfast. She had a Greek omelet and I had a western omelet. Then, too soon, it was time to head back to the trail and say goodbye. 
After parking at County Road 517 I decided I had too much food. I removed a bag of bagels, a jar of peanut butter, and a few packs of crackers. I only needed three days worth I concluded. 
Heartrock and I said goodbyes complete with hugs and kisses. We reminded each other we'd see each other in 12 days when I reach Duncannon. 
At 9:40 I headed out on the trail waving to Heartrock as she waved to me until she was out of sight. The trail went up and over some hills and creeks. After Pochuck Mountain the trail dropped steeply down rocks until reaching the Wallkill National Wildlife Preserve. 
I met two nobo section hikers slipping on the long wet boards through the forest as I was doing the same. Then the trail came out to the open wetlands of the preserve. The trail enters the area then does a loop around the edge of the wetlands. Different species of birds rested or hunted in the grasses or the ponds. A beautiful area. 
After a short road walk the trail crossed the Wallkill River and a short distance later returned to the woods. Rain started and lasted about 20 minutes. 
Just before crossing NJ 284 I slipped on a tilted boardwalk. My trekking poles flew and I felt I did too then I landed on the boardwalk on my left side, ouch! I stood up, recovered my trekking poles and continued. 
A short distance after the road and a few fields the trail followed an old railroad bed until veering off near Lott Road. At Lott Road I veered off the trail and into Unionville, NY because Horler's store and deli are there. But since I ate well this morning my mission was just for ice cream and a soda. 
After my mission was complete I headed back to the trail. I went up a different way because of an old green 1940s truck, I was looking for it. I first saw it in 1998 with tall grass around it. In 2008 I saw it and it was being driven around. In 2012 I saw it parked. And today, I saw it again, parked by a garage at the old house I first saw it at. Looks like its still running. 
Back to the trail and onward. Trail was very wet. Just before one road crossing I slid on a big long smooth rock and went right down on my bad knee. Oh, that hurt. I got up and it hurt.   Plus I scraped my shin bone pretty good. A good five inch streak of a bloody scrape. Keep on walking is all I can do. 
The woods were fogging. Kind of spooky. A couple of Barred Owls were making strange noises up in the trees. They were squawking kind of like crows. Spooky woods. 
After crossing a road and climbing steeply the trail weaved through the foggy woods and across a creek. I met a nobo section hiker Knock Knock who was going to night hike and asked about the terrain. I said the terrain was good after the initial drop ahead. I especially warned him of the slippery boardwalks and bridges while showing him my scraped leg and drying blood. 
At 6:40 p.m. I arrived at High Point Shelter and camped across the creek from it. Strangely, no one is here. Rain began about 7:30. The katydids are calling. I heard a Barred owl, too. I can hear the creek running strong below the campsite. I hope my knee works tomorrow.","Pochuck Creek, NJ
",High Point Shelter,"Sep 12, Wed",16.60
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603172,"Light rain overnight and into this morning. I was hungry so I got up and retrieved my food from the bear box up next to the shelter. 
I was glad my knee was OK from the fall on the rock yesterday but my left hand and ribs hurt from the earlier tumble on the boardwalk. 
Rain stopped except drops off the trees. I was on the trail at 7:29. The morning was foggy. No view of the High Point Monument today. 
The trail continued through the wet woodlands all morning. On top of Sunrise Mountain I did get my first views into Pennsylvania. 
I saw no thru hikers all day. I saw a nobo section hiker in the Anderson shelter in his tent at 3 p.m. A short time later at Culver Fire Tower I met another nobo section hiker, Spidermonkey. 
I dropped to US 206. I was debating if I should stop at the deli because I had plenty of food. I decided I at least needed a soda. But when I got to the deli it was closed...out of business. Oh, well. 
5 p.m. Up the mountain. Sun was shining after several days of hiding. 
Today I saw more newts than I've seen all my life. They were everywhere. Usually I see hundreds of little toads. Today it's hundreds of newts...and one big black snake. Up to today I have only been seeing garter snakes. 
Around 6:30 I noticed how low the sun was. I was pushing to get to Brink Shelter and knew it would be after 7 p.m. Hope there enough light to set up the tent. 
I came to the old road that leads to Brink Shelter at 7:04. After .2 of a mile I came to the shelter. There at the shelter was Southwind, the section hiker from West Virginia. He is doing New York and New Jersey. No one else was around. I finally got his name when Heartrock and I saw him at the Pochuck Boardwalk two days ago. 
I found a campsite and dropped my gear. I hustled down to the spring for two liters of water. I got the tent up and gear inside and did not need the headlamp. A good day. 
The katydids are singing me to sleep.","High Point Shelter
","Brink Shelter, NJ","Sep 13, Thu",19.60
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603289,"Just before I decided to pack up I heard light rain on the tent. It happened twice and then I packed up quickly. I didn't want to carry a wet tent. A good incentive to get up. 
I retrieved my food from the bear box, said goodbye to Southwind and headed up to the trail. I begin hiking at 7:19. 
Today was to be more interesting than yesterday but it also was more difficult. Right away it was a climb up Rattlesnake mountain. Since it was damp and foggy I had to be careful on the slick open ledges. 
After a few miles the trail followed an old road that once was for seasonal houses. The government took the properties for the development of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area. A big part of the project was a dam on the Delaware River but it was never built. 
Maybe an easy mile on the road then the trail entered the woods and down a mini cliff. What a sudden change, from cruising to bruising. 
At a dead end paved road I went down around the corner to a spring. Back up the road to the trail I had another mile or so through the old development. Travel was fast and good. 
The road ended and it was a rocky trail once again. Then another paved road, a dirt road, and a trail up to Catfish Fire Tower. (Yesterday's fire tower was Culver Fire Tower not Catfish). 
After climbing the tower I had a few good views of Kittatinny Ridge which I had been following. Rain showers could be seen in different directions. As I climbed down I began to receive some of the shower activity but it didn't last. 
At about 3:20 I turned up the road to the Appalachian Mountain Club's Mohican Outdoor Center. The AMC is the same organization that runs the hut system in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. (AMC is also known as the Appalachian Money Club due to their prices). 
I went in and got a $2.75 16oz bottle of Dr. Pepper (see what I mean). I asked Misty about the Thru Hiker Breakfast. Though it was supper time breakfast is served all day. I ordered the breakfast and while it was being made I took a $5 shower. 
The hot shower was worth it. The $12 breakfast was worth it. It had a 1"" plate size pancake, scrambled eggs, four strips of bacon, and toast. I had one big bulging belly! 
I paid my $19.66 bill and thanked Misty who was a wonderful host. Then I went out to pack up. 
Southwind came in. We talked a bit and he even invited me to stop at his place in Harper's Ferry, WV when I pass through. His hike ends tomorrow at the Delaware Water Gap, about 10 more miles. He was hiking all of New York and New Jersey. We said goodbye and I headed out. 
Speaking of pancakes I saw a rattlesnake on the road. I think the tour bus I saw on this narrow dirt road earlier flattened him like a pancake, though my pancake was much thicker then he is right now. 
Back on the trail at 4:45 p.m. and I want to get four more miles in. But just after 6 p.m. I came to the boundary of Worthington State Forest. Camping is only permitted at two locations and I didn't want to travel that far tonight. So I backtrack a few hundred feet to where I saw a legal campsite. AT thru hikers can camp in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area if they between 50 to 100 feet off the trail and I was. 
I set up my tent facing Pennsylvania across the Delaware River. This will be my last night in New Jersey. Tomorrow it is 8 miles to the Interstate 80 bridge across the Delaware River and into my home state of Pennsylvania. 
Also monitoring the track of Hurricane Florence. At this time it looks like the heavy rains will be west of me. I hope not to have to evacuate off the trail as I was told to do during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. 
Right now the katydids are singing. They are not alone as I can hear a high school band down below to my east in New Jersey playing away.","Brink Shelter, NJ

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603385,"Up and on trail at 6:08. The Snake Roots' white flowers along the trail shined bright in the headlamp's rays. After just ten minutes I was out of the woods and on a rocky open knoll. 
To the east I could see a possible sunrise if the blanket of clouds allowed that opening to remain. To the west blue and gray fog and clouds coated what land formations I could make out in Pennsylvania. The Delaware River look a little brighter than the rest of the landscape as the dawn chased away the night. 
A rocky walk around glacial-made Sunset Pond. The sun was out and reflecting brightly across the pond's acidic waters. Looks like a beautiful day is developing. 
After a long drop on an old road I came to Interstate 80. The trail goes under an overpass and passed by the Delaware Water Gap visitors center. A park ranger walked to me and told me where to get water and how the trail would go to access the bridge. She even gave me the weather report. I thanked her and continued. 
Up on the bridge a six inch wall of concrete and a four foot berm is all that separated me from the trucks and traffic of the interstate.  But at 10:20 my thoughts were on my crossing into Pennsylvania. The border was painted on the walkway. I was a happy hiker. 
In the town of Delaware Water Gap, PA, I left my pack at the Church of the Mountains Hiker Hostel. I went into town and bought four days of food at the Gulf Food Mart. Since the old DWG Diner was now closed I bought some breakfast sandwiches at the mart. It was afternoon and I think the sandwiches were from very early this morning. However, they were hiker quality so I ate them. 
Back at the hostel I charged my phone and took a hot shower. No other hikers there but I did meet the caretaker and left a donation. 
I left at 1:30 and began the hike up Mt. Minsi. Lots of cars parked at the bottom and lots of people all the way up. The climb got steeper and steeper. By the time I reached the top I was soaked with sweat. 
The trail followed a service road for the mountain's towers. Great walking for a mile or two. Then rocky trail. The trail is now in ""Rocksylvania"" as hikers call it. 
I stopped at Kirkridge Shelter and I think it's the cleanest shelter on the trail. Nearby the Blue Mountain Retreat Center has a faucet in the woods providing good water for the hikers. Being a weekend, I was surprised no one was at the shelter. 
I continued for a few more miles as I push towards Duncannon hoping to reach there on the 23rd. The sun was getting low but the clear sky was allowing me more daylight than the last few days provided. 
After passing a few good sites I thought I'd go just a little further beyond the trail to Wolf Rock Spring. Not long until the woods looked like this is where the glaciers deposited their rock debris. Actually, that is what they did. Rocks and rock, all over. Finally at 7 p.m. I saw two spots and took the most secluded. 
It was quiet at first but as darkness fell the katydids began their nightly serenade. Good to be home in Pennsylvania.","Delaware Water Gap National Rec. Area

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603426,"On trail about 6:15. A beautiful morning. The sun was lighting up the eastern horizon. 
An old friend is meeting me this morning. Two Eagles hiked the New Jersey section of the AT with me when I was hiking the Eastern Continental Trail in 2012. Back then his trail name was Travel Well. It is now Two Eagles in honor of his two sons being Eagle Scouts. 
We connected around 9 a.m. With him was Too Tall and his dog Tink. Two Eagles had his dog Emma. We talked then headed back to their vehicle at the PA 33 trail head. 
At the trail head we loaded up into Too Tall's hiker van and drove down the hill to Turkey Hill. Two Eagles treated us. I got a coffee, steak egg & cheese on a bagel, and an Italian sub for later. 
We stood outside eating and talking for a bit then headed back up the trail. 
We continued on the trail south going up the hillside. It wasn't terribly steep but the heat and humidity were making us sweat. 
After the trail leveled out we took a long break talking. I was enjoying their company. The two female dogs were resting in the grass. 
After almost four hours together today talking and hiking Too Tall and Two Eagles headed back, all too soon. I hate goodbyes but once again we said goodbye. I watched as they headed down the trail admittedly a little sad. But we'll get together perhaps later this year. 
I headed up the trail then stopped to eat the Italian sub. I was feeling tired. 
After a few miles I came to Smith Shelter. I got two liters of water and headed out about 2:30. The day was warm. 
From the shelter to the end of the day I was fighting spider webs. Seem not a soul hiked that section today so I was the one clearing the trail of the webs. 
At Stempa's Spring Trail I dropped my pack and headed down the trail. This is the last reliable water for over ten miles and the trail soon goes through Palmerton Superfund site. I had no choice but to get water here. 
The trail went DOWN the mountainside. What a long .6 of a mile drop. I reached the bottom in 15 minutes. At first I though the spring was dry but then I saw a pipe below a large flat rock spilling out cool clear water. I got two liters and headed back up the hill taking 20 sweaty minutes to do so. 
After packing up I pushed to Dell's Trail. An unreliable spring is down over the mountain but I only want to camp at the trail intersection. No way am I going down that hill again. I got to the intersection at 7:12. A good day. 
The trail was indeed rocky and killing my knee and foot corn. But once again I am in my tent awaiting the katydids to begin their nightly performance. 
Great thanks to Too Tall and Two Eagles coming out today. You really encouraged me.","Wolf Rocks, PA

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603505,"On trail at 5:49. Want to get through Lehigh Gap before the rain from Tropical Storm Florence begins. Heartrock said I can expect rain at 2 p.m. 
It wasn't long before the treetops were in either the fog or the storm moving in. But for now I needed to just push on and not worry. 
It was a New Hampshire style power line boulder drop down onto Little Gap. I fell and cut my left leg. Now both legs have matching boo boos. But at the road someone left water containers and my boulder bouncing frustration was gone. 
Then the climb over Palmerton Mountain, a Superfund site. Most of the vegetation was once wiped out by a nearby zinc smelting works. Now it is coming back after decades of restoration. The fog covered the mountain and all was wet. But it is an easy hike with plenty to see. 
The drop into Lehigh Gap is dangerous. Fortunately the rain didn't start yet and I made it down safely. I crossed the bridge over the Lehigh River about 11:10. Most of the fog had lifted by noon but the sky was threatening. 
It was a good climb up the next mountain. I got water at Outerbridge Shelter's spring. After treating the water and eating the rest of my peanut butter I continued. 
Later I stopped at the southern junction at South Trail for a break. It had been sprinkling for awhile, but when I placed my pack on it became a steady rain. I looked at my watch and it was 2 p.m. 
At 3 p.m. the rain was heavy for half an hour. At the same time I was carefully going across huge rock fields. The rocks and rain subsided and at 3:45 I came to Bake Oven Knob Shelter.  I though I might not get here until 5 or later and all depended on the trail conditions and the weather. 
No one at the shelter so I set up my tent inside. This is to avoid bugs and mice. I retrieved water from a piped spring and returned to the shelter to retire for the stormy evening. 
The worst of the storm is to be overnight. I usually don't stay in shelters but will tonight and perhaps tomorrow night.","

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603576,"Rain, heavy at times, overnight and into this morning. Windy every now and then. But overall Tropical Storm Florence was just a typical storm. 
After 7 a.m. the storm seem to be ending. Perhaps just a lull before another round of rain. I decided to pack and head out. I expected to hike all day in the rain anyway. On the trail at 7:40. 
Right away it was a wet slippery climb up Bake Oven Knob. The rocks were indeed wet and I had to be careful. Being close to a road many of the rocks were graffiti covered. 
About 8:30 the rain was heavy. I had my poncho over my pack and myself. 
I was relieved I did not have to go over Bear Rocks. I could see them exposed to my right in the rain but access was via a side trail. 
However, Knife Edge or ""The Cliffs"" was next. What a dangerous excursion up and over heaved up rock. Going through was difficult in the wind and rain. The rain made it slippery and the wind blew the poncho around sometimes not allowing me to see where to place my feet. This was purposeless and insanely dangerous. I was afraid more than any place on the trail this year. But I made it through. 
Not long afterwards I met two Nobo section hikers separately. I warned them both and told them to be safe. 
The rain slowed about 11 a.m. At 11:30 I crossed RT 309 and walked to the Blue Mountain Summit Restaurant and B &  B but it was closed. The summit was covered in fog but the rain had stopped. 
Not long into the woods I could see blue sky to the west. One of the hikers I saw earlier said the storm was to be over later this afternoon, hopefully earlier. 
Around 1 p.m. the sun did come out. When I arrived at the Allentown Shelter around 1:20 I was able to put my gear out in the sun to dry. 
After a long drop to the spring and back I was able to pack up my dry rain gear and head out. It was just after 2 p.m. 
Though the sun was out the trail was still wet and water still running down the trail or pooling. My feet were soaked. 
The trail today had some brutal areas but also some great woods roads to follow. I always described the Pennsylvania section of the AT that, about the time you get frustrated, then you get on a good section. Then back and forth. 
I saw one more Nobo section hiker before Dan's Pulpit. I didn't see any hikers yesterday and I saw no thru hikers since I saw Habib at Wawayanda Shelter eight days ago. I did see in a shelter's registrar that eight Sobos are two days ahead of me. 
After the side trail to Hawk Mountain Sanctuary the trail went down to the valley on a long old road and I came to the Eckville Road at 6:14. I followed the road downhill .2 to the Eckville Shelter. 
The shelter is behind the caretaker's house. Its a big old shed with bunks inside. It was kind of dirty and musty. Fortunately the wide front door was to remain open all night. 
In another shed is the restroom. I got a cool shower then went back to the shelter. I also could charge my phone there. 
I spoke to the caretaker whose trail name is Lazy. I told him I hiked in '98 and '08 and stopped here. After a few minutes he came back out into the dark wearing a headlamp as I was. He handed me two registers from 1998. 
I went through it for half an hour but could not locate any entry by me. Lots of familiar names but no Lake. 
Later I handed the books back to Lazy and thanked him. It had been dark for quite a while and I was beat. Besides a wet rocky day I was short on food. The prior four day stretch I had a surplus. Now I'm short, very short. I was hoping a hiker box would be here with food in it but only a pack of Endurance energy gels were found. So, earlier, I heated water and dumped it into my empty peanut butter jar. I made peanut butter soup. For tomorrow I have that Endurance gel pack and a single packet of Spam.","Bake Oven Knob Shelter

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603736,"My knee bothered me greatly overnight. I didn't get much sleep because I have to keep shifting my legs. Plus the new Merrells I got back in Warwick, NY are not the wide width I requested so the foot corn flared up the last few days and that is painful too. 
At 4:16 a.m. I was wide awake so I decided to head out. Though dark out it was a beautiful morning. The stars were out as I walked through the wet grass to the road. Going up the road I could see lightning bugs in the wet grass on both sides of the road. Some a steady glow and some a slow blink. 
Turning on my headlamp after the last house I found the trail and the time was right on 5 a.m. As I started the climb I ate the single packet of Spam. Now all that is left is the Endurance gels. 
I knew the trail was mostly a road for miles up to the Pinnacle so I wasn't too concerned about hiking in the dark. At one point the road split and I had to drop my gear to walk ahead to investigate. I found a white blaze up the road to the right out of sight. After I walked back to my gear I continued up the correct route. 
Though I couldn't see a lot I could hear multiple streams coming down the mountainsides in various directions. At about 6:15 I turned off the headlamp. The morning was wide awake and getting brighter by the minute. A Honeycomb day. 
Somewhere in Windsor Furnace I followed a Reservoir Road south. Though I ate the gels I was hungry and very tired. Today I'm not going to be a white blaze purist (someone who hikes every inch of the trail). I'm making a detour and it's longer than the regular route. 
It wasn't long before I was in farmland paralleling the AT and I-78. I was between them somewhere. I had to use Google maps to navigate. I saw an exit on the map but it was one mile before the exit I wanted at Pa 61. When I got near it the exit didn't connect to any roads on the north side. I decided to walk down a dead end street. As I was climbing over the highway fence I saw a woman nearby who just drove out of her garage and was watching me. Was she calling the police I wondered. 
I got over the fence and down to the bridge over I-78. I thought this would be a quick way to the store and back to the trail. All I want is some processed fast food. No cops yet. 
After a few blocks there was the Hamburg Market. I went in to get four days of food but they really were short on food. They didn't even sell bread. But I did get four days worth, a coffee and a microwaveable hamburger. If in Hamburg eat a Hamburger. 
I went outside to eat and drink my coffee. The Hamburg hamburger was I think actually Hamburg BBQ but we'll accept the minor discrepancy. I called Heartrock and put my food in the food bag then headed north up Port Clinton Drive. I figured it had to go to Port Clinton. 
It was a couple of miles up the road. Finally I came back to the Appalachian Trail. I followed it as it headed along the Schuylkill River and into Port Clinton. The river was running bank full from the recent rains. 
I was heading to the town's pavilion that hikers are allowed to stay at. I intended to leave my gear there and walk to 3C's restaurant but at the last minute I decided to continue to the restaurant. 
I was happy to find they serve breakfast all day. I ordered the Meatlover's Farmer's Omelet. It was full of meat and potatoes. It was delivered round and cut like a pizza. After I made that disappear I asked for ice cream but they had none. Freezer burn she told me. I did settle on a chocolate chocolate cake with chocolate icing...so chocolaty good. 
I returned to the pavilion but was indecisive on what to do. I could go on a few miles or I could stay. It was the middle of the afternoon. 
My feet had sore areas from the new shoes and needed attention. I had wet shoes for two days now and that may have caused the sore areas. Back at the Hamburg store there were no Band-aids but here at the hiker box there were. After a call to Nurse Heartrock she said I should stop and relax, take care of my feet and the ugly corn (she really is a nurse). So I stayed. 
First, I walked back to town with three jugs of water for the pavilion. Before I got to the house where the trail angels let us use their spigot a woman told me to use hers. I thanked her not only for the water but it saved me a block or two walk. 
Back at the pavilion I fixed my feet the best as I could. I saw a pair of Merrells size 11 left at the hiker box. They were in good shape and I was hoping to annex them. But though they were a half size bigger they were just too tight in the nose. Though I could use them in the future carrying them 70 miles was weight prohibitive. 
Signs indicate hikers are to keep this place in shape. So, besides getting water I swept some and went through the trash to put what can be recycled in the correct bin. 
I put up my tent on the north side of the pavilion. On the south side of the pavilion are two dead ash trees killed by the Emerald Ash borer. One dead ash in front by the entrance pillars dropped a branch while I was sitting here. That tree won't hit the pavilion. So, I think I'm safe from tree damage.  Rt 61 is just up a steep bank and the traffic is constant. But I suspect traffic will subside as the evening rolls on. 
I heated up two cans of tomato soup that were left here and even shaved. Now it's 6 p.m. and I so want to go to sleep. 
The plan for the next four days is to reach Duncannon. Once there I will go home to winterize my house. I will also visit my ailing friend Sally whose trail name is Mourning Dove. Then I will drive with Heartrock to Florida for her annual migration to work for eight months in the hot Florida urban jungle called Fort Myers. On October 4th I will fly to Harrisburg, walk to the Doyle Hotel in Duncannon, and continue my hike south to Georgia. Ah, bedtime.","Eckville Shelter

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603805,"In the dark I walked to 3C's restaurant using my headlamp. I got there just after they opened at 6 a.m. No other customers were there yet. The waitress talked and laughed like Fran from the TV show ""The Nanny.""
I ordered French toast, two orders of sausage patties and, for later today, two steak, egg and cheese breakfast sandwiches. 
After I ate and paid my bill the waitress wished me well, told me to be safe, and said ""God bless you."" 
It was light out when I left and I headed back to the pavilion carrying my two breakfast sandwiches. At the pavilion I packed up my gear. I took the foil wrapped breakfast sandwiches out of the Styrofoam container and slid them into an empty bagel bag I had. I also decided to annex the Merrells left in the hiker box that I liked. I left at 7:30. 
I was on the trail at 7:40 but immediately had to stop across from the fire station to fix the bandage on my corn. It was too much pain at first but after adjustment it felt better. 
The trail followed the road across the Little Schuylkill River and then left into the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern rail yard. I could see the excursion passenger cars up ahead as I crossed the main branch of the Schuylkill River. After I crossed four or five sets of tracks the trail climbed steadily up the mountainside. 
On top I stopped and ate my first breakfast sandwich. It was great. Steak, egg, cheese and peppers. Oh! 
The trail was pretty good during the morning. Only a few rocky sections. 
At noon I saw two Nobo section hikers taking a break. One guy said he was glad to see me. They were having the same problem I had all morning - spider webs! He told me they cleared them off the trail for me and I said I did the same for them. 
I didn't get his name but his friend's name was Dancer, his trail name and his real name. They are hiking from Duncannon to Port Clinton to break in their gear. Next year they plan to do the whole Appalachian Trail. We talked a bit then I headed out. I hope they do well. 
At 2 p.m. I stopped at the access trail to Eagle's Nest Shelter. I sat down and ate the other breakfast sandwich. It was fabulously luscious. I like those fancy words. Seriously, they made really great breakfast sandwiches for me. I'll have to drive there when I finish the trail. 
PA-183 was a dangerous crossing. The trail came out of the woods to meet the four lane highway on the inside of a curve. I stepped out a few times only to step back fast. I made it to the double lines and had to wait there for a truck in the next two lanes to go by. 
After the Fort Dietrich Snyder marker the trail condition deteriorated. The old road for miles was eroded and full of puddles. Various trails the hikers made going around the bad areas left me wondering which was the real trail. The trail was just as bad 20 years ago, I remember. 
I saw a guy sitting on a log. I think I startled him. He said he was listening to the bio of Mister Rogers. The hiker's name was Hot Rocks. He is the first Sobo I've seen in 10 days. He began a week before I did. 
I was looking for a site to camp and, as we both headed out, I told him to go on ahead. He was heading to the 501 Shelter. 
The trail got better and there was thick mountain laurel for a few miles but no campsite. Finally, at 6:50, I saw a site and stopped. 
Right now the katydids are calling and, as I have for a few days, can hear the traffic of I-78 somewhere down the mountain.","Eckville Shelter

After daylight arrived I went by Shikellamy Overlook but saw only fog. At the next vista farms appeared and disappeared as the winds picked up and began blowing the fog away. 
I came to the 501 Shelter at PA 501. Though I had food I was extra hungry. It is probably because of all the extra food I ate yesterday. I hoped the enclosed shelter had a hiker box and it did. I only saw one item of food and I picked it up. I went back outside to heat water then I poured in the Knorr's Alfredo Broccoli noodle mix. It was good and hot. I burnt my mouth because I was impatient. But it hit the spot. 
I got water near the caretaker's house. There was a solar shower but it was chilly out so I passed on that idea. Back to the trail. 
O.P. passed me by. He is a Sobo too and had stayed at 501. He said Sweet is ahead, whom I met way back near Monson. He also said Spencer is a few days back. Spencer started at Mt Katahdin the same day I did. So, I'm finally catching up and passing by some hikers I met before I got sick in July. 
The wind was picking up. The mosquito squadrons were grounded for the day. Sometimes it looked as if rain was imminent but nothing all day. 
Between 501 and William Penn Shelter the trail was an old road for miles. I could really cruise. After Penn Shelter the trail got real bad for 10 minutes then better as a regular trail all the way down to the underpass at I-81. 
Just after 81 is Swatara State Park. As I started to go up the ramp to the bridge a ranger stopped and talked with me. He asked how all was going, told me about the park, and showed me a detour around a washed out area. I thanked him and continued across Swatara Creek. 
The bridge across the creek is the old Waterville bridge that once crossed Little Pine Creek in Lycoming County. When it was replaced it was dismantled and rebuilt here. I remember crossing it as a kid as our wagon train headed west. 
I hiked through the woods and crossed a few roads taking the detour the ranger mentioned. Then the trail left the park and began its climb up Second Mountain. At the first campsite I saw I stopped for the day. It was 6:50 p.m. 
It was a 21 mile day but hiking was mostly steady except for Shubert's Gap and dropping down to Swatara Creek. I wanted to push today and tomorrow to get into Duncannon Sunday. Tomorrow will be another high mileage day as the trail is good and the climbs and descents not bad. 
Tonight is the last night of summer. The Katydids are singing and I hear the traffic of I-81. A few sprinkles on the tent. A good day.","Near Schubert's Gap, PA

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604043,"Forgot to mention yesterday that near Swatara State Park I passed the 1,000 mile mark. The halfway point is coming up at around mile 1,095. 
A few rain showers overnight but nothing serious. The rain fly was mostly dry except the corners. I hit the trail at 6:45. 
I continued the climb over Second Mountain. A prescribed burn was completed in May for this area. But now the trail was enveloped in weeds on and off for miles. My shoes were wet but soon that wouldn't make any difference. 
After dropping off the mountain and leaving the burn area Obstacle #2 was just ahead. Amazingly, beavers built a dam right along the trail for about 200 feet. I could see the bridge way up ahead almost on a straight line. The beavers' dam paralleled the trail. The thick woods were flooded upstream. 
The bad part was for those 200 feet the dam was leaking everywhere and the trail was a muddy mess. Since my feet were already wet I wasn't too careful going across. 
I went through the site of the village of Rauch Gap, a mining and railroad town. Then crossed the old railroad and followed the trail on the old road to the site of the village of Yellow Springs. 
On the way two guys and a girl came by and asked about my trip. One guy gave me four cheese rolls, the other gave me a Clif Bar, and the girl gave me a banana. I was grateful for the extra food. 
Later, while on a break O.P. came by and we talked for 10 minutes. He was the only through hiker I had seen all day. 
I stopped at Stony Mountain for a break. Then headed down the long descent to PA 325. I've been seeing lots of hikers due to it being the weekend. 
After crossing PA 325 I got two liters at a spring. I wasn't sure if I'd make it to the shelter but even if I did it's 300 steps down the mountain for water. I decided to get it beforehand. 
Once on top of the ridge I took a break. It was breezy and chilly so I put another shirt on. 
After a few miles I came to Kinter View. I was going to continue but I saw a dip between the ridge and the viewpoint. I decided since it was going to be a cool night I should camp in the dip to stay out of the wind. I investigated and saw a camp site. Time was 6:37. 
The temperature drop is appropriate for the first day of Fall. Tomorrow is a 13.6 mile hike into Duncannon. That means a big burger and fries at the Doyle Hotel for lunch. Then 11 days off.","Second Mountain

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604138,"Once again the pain in my leg wasn't allowing me to sleep continuously. After 3 a.m. rain began. Since I was going home later today I wasn't too concerned about the normally undesirable prospect of packing up a wet tent. 
About 3:30 I made coffee. Later, I heated water and shaved for my town day. Looking forward to either the Doyle's pulled pork BBQ - the best in the country according to Backpacker magazine - or just a big burger. Until I get there all I have is a small pack of Chips Ahoy and two small bags of peanuts. The Chips Ahoy were my breakfast. 
Packed up and on the trail at 4:53 a.m. I had all my rain gear on. I used my headlamp and it seemed faint. I hoped it was the fog and not weakening batteries as I have about an hour and a half of a foggy rainy darkness to hike into. 
The trail wasn't too difficult to follow. There were no serious rocky areas. The white AT blazes reflected my headlamp's dull light. 
Just as the wet night turned into a wet morning I passed Peters Mountain Shelter. I made good time despite the obstacles. 
As I continued the rain stopped. I crossed over foggy PA 225 on the walkway as traffic slowly crested the ridge below me. 
A few views allowed me to see the foggy farmlands of the Susquehanna River Valley to the west. In the opposite side of the ridge I could see the Susquehanna River cutting through the mountains as it made its way towards the Chesapeake Bay. A beautiful day. 
I was going to stop at Clark's Ferry Shelter for water but I just wanted to push on into Duncannon even if it meant running on empty. 
As I followed the ridge I could hear train whistles on both sides of the mountain. The railroad tracks follow the ever curving river through the various cuts in the mountains. 
Dropping down to civilization has its good and bad points. Good food in town is a big draw but the noise of the highways is discouraging.   In a short distance I could hear the traffic from US 322, US 15, and PA 147. 
The bridge across the Susquehanna River bounced due to the truck traffic but soon I was on a side street going into Duncannon. 
When I got to the Doyle Hotel it was 11:50 a.m. I didn't expect to get there until 1 p.m. But my hopes of a big burger or BBQ were dashed, the door of the Doyle was locked. 
Well, no problem. I'll just go across the street to Goodies. They always have a good breakfast. But as I arrived the I noticed that on Sundays they close at 11 a.m. Oh, man, now what?! OK, next choice is something to eat at the convenience store nearby. 
Just as I walked away a woman came out of Goodies' door and asked what I was looking for. I said food with a smile. She is Nancy who operates Nancy's Soft Pretzels next to Goodies and shares the same front door. She makes soft pretzels Thursday, Friday, and Saturdays but on Sundays she makes meals to go. 
She said today her meal is Asian Chicken. I said I was looking for breakfast. She said she might be able to cook me breakfast but I declined because its not what she usually does. I said maybe I can get something at the store. Then, between puffs of her constantly present cigarette, she motherly told me she's making me breakfast. I agreed. 
     I went to the bank's ATM across the street. While there I saw Vicky. She and her husband own the Doyle. She remembered me and gave me a big hug. She said they no longer are open Sundays due to slow business. I told her I'd be staying there next week. After talking I returned to Nancy's across the street. 
When I went in there was a whole a pot of coffee and a place setting for me at a long otherwise empty table. 
Nancy said she is open until 5 p.m. or until she sells out which she usually does. But she thought perhaps the Asian Chicken wasn't something locals wanted today. Only one customer came in during the time I was there. 
She served me a ham and cheese omelet and hash browns. She also gave me a piece of pineapple upside down cake. All was delicious. Everything she makes is from scratch and all was absolutely delicious. 
She surprisingly refused payment. She wouldn't even take a tip. She was just glad to help me out. I told her I'll return next week and try her much raved about pretzels. 
As I waited outside for Heartrock, Nancy talked with me while continually puffing away at her cigarettes. 
Heartrock was at Farm Aid in Connecticut over the weekend and was driving directly from there to pick me up in Duncannon. She was delayed due to highway construction but did arrive safely at 1:50 p.m. 
Heartrock, Nancy and I talked a bit before we headed out. I thanked Nancy for her generosity. I told her I'll see her next week. 
Heartrock and I headed north and arrived at my house about 4 p.m. 
For now, 11 days off. After driving to Florida with Heartrock I'll fly back to Pennsylvania on October 4th and resume hiking to Georgia on the 5th.","Kinter View

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604226,"The eleven zero days flew by quickly.  The first two days I checked flood damage at home and on the Cold Run Trail I built last year at World's End State Park. There was only mild damage. 
Another day I went with a county official to GPS another section of the planned Endless Mountains Trail. It was a beautiful section going by Lopez Pond. Later we descended Lopez Pond Branch Run to an old lumber railroad yard. Then we ascended up Muncy Creek at one point going through a miniature gorge before ending at Cherry Ridge Road. 
Last Thursday and Friday I drove with Heartrock to Florida where she works October until the end of May. 
The next couple of days we relaxed and took her dog Brody on walks. Florida temperatures were in the 90s, too hot for me. 
I tried to and thought I did put some weight back on but as of this morning I still am down 30 pounds. I also had to buy new Merrell boots because my other new ones were not the wide width I had asked for. I also bought a new knee brace to ease the stress on my right knee. Heartrock had ordered me new trekking poles. 
This morning Heartrock dropped me off at the Punta Gorda airport. Goodbyes once again. My ticket said TSA Precheck meaning I should get through rather quickly, not even having to take my shoes off.  But as in the past this was not true for me. I was sent back through the scanner, shoes off and sent back, frisked, padded down, scanned with a wand and hands checked for explosives. This has happened previous times despite having a TSA Precheck memo on my ticket. I guess I must look dangerously suspicious. But, I am glad the TSA is doing its job. 
The flight arrived in Harrisburg, PA on time. A few days earlier I contacted Trail Angel Mary and arranged for a ride from the airport to the Doyle Hotel in Duncannon. I texted her from the front of the airport and she was there within minutes. 
After she dropped me off in Duncannon it was 10:30 a.m. so I went to Goodies for breakfast. I had their Texas French toast. A piece of French toast in the middle and the outsides are pancakes all cooked into one piece. 
Afterwords I got permethrin at a local outfitter, Outdoorsy.  Permethrin kills ticks and mosquitoes on clothes and gear up to 42 days or 6 washings. 
I went to the Doyle Hotel and got a room. Pat and Vicky greeted me. Indian went and got my backpack I dropped off last week. Up in the room I sprayed my gear and clothes with the permethrin. Then I went to the convenience store for two days worth of food. I went back to Nancy's, who made me the breakfast last week, as I had promised. I bought two of her homemade pretzels and a cherry soda. Then back across the street to the Doyle. I was done with everything so early I wished I had started hiking today. 
     After packing up my reunited backpack I planned ahead a few days. Looks like Maryland early next week, followed quickly by West Virginia and Virginia. While Maryland and West Virginia are short Virginia is over a month of hiking. 
     I recovered from several naps and headed down to the dining room. Earlier I met Sammertime and now he was about to leave. He is hiking from Quebec to Florida similar to what I did in the opposite direction in 2012. 
    For supper I had a big burger, fries, coke and a hard cider of some kind. Now I am on the porch of the hotel as evening descends on the little borough. I can hear the katydids calling between the frequent clickety-clacks and horns of the nearby railroad. 
     Tomorrow I'll get as close to the Cumberland Valley as possible. No camping is permitted through the suburban valley so I'll tackle that Saturday planning to go beyond Boiling Springs. 
     Also have new boots, socks, and trekking poles. I added my fleece jacket and newer warmer sleeping bag. But now a week of above normal temps will not require much use out of either as the warmer weather will escort me perhaps to the Virginia border. No matter what, I am anxious to get back to hiking.","Duncannon, PA

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604266,"About 6:30 I went to the convenience store for coffee. I had that and one of Nancy's soft pretzels I bought yesterday for breakfast. 
I showered and packed up my gear heading out about 8. I went back to the store for sunglasses because I broke mine yesterday. 
On the trail in town about 8:15. I crossed under US 11 & 15 then followed old route 15 going by some businesses on the old dead end highway. The bridge plaque over Sherman Creek indicates the bridge and highway were built in 1930. 
The trail left the road and climbed up to Hawk Rock. It took me an hour to get there from the hotel. There were rock steps and plenty of loose rock. But at Hawk Rock the hike became worth the effort. Great views up the Juniata and Susquehanna Rivers. Duncannon was just south of the rivers' junction and on a big bend of the Susquehanna. 
The trail climbed a little more then stayed on the ridge of Cove Mountain. I met two Sobos I hadn't met before as I was taking a break. Jalapeno was her name but I didn't quite understand the guy's name. They were from Tennessee. 
I heard several flocks of geese passing over, another reminder of the change in seasons. Today was cool not getting as hot as predicted. 
The trail followed some old woods roads then passed through open fields. The trail entered the woods again and went beside old farm foundations. 
After the Darlington Trail intersection the trail dropped quickly. I wanted to get as close to the Cumberland Valley as permitted. I hoped there would be campsites at the spring near the intersection with Wolf Trail. A mile beyond that I knew for sure there would be no permitted camping. 
I came to the spring at 3:50. I was glad to see a large camping area. Near the center of the site were the rusted remains of an unidentifiable old automobile. 
I treated two liters of water and established my camp. Though early I couldn't go much further for the day. But I was glad to make my planned destination. 
The sounds I hear are the hums of I-81, I-76, US 11 and the busy growing suburban streets of the Harrisburg metro area. And an occasional acorn hitting the metal of that old car and momentarily startling me. 
After 11 days off, the body is a little sore from the day. But it's good to be back on the trail.

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604292,"Though on the trail at 6:25, I had to use the headlamp for 20 minutes. Days are definitely getting shorter. Blazes were sparse and the trail curved around as it finished descending the mountain so movement was slow. But once the day began travel was good. 
The trail followed a small stream then followed close along swift Conodoguinet Creek. The trail was beautiful along both waterways. 
I stopped at the ATC Scott Farm for water but it was already turned off for the season. I took a break on the picnic table before heading out and across the road bridge over Conodoguinet Creek. 
A beautiful boardwalk followed the creek then the trail hung high above the banks before climbing to some farmland. The trail went through pastures and corn fields then across I-81. More farmland then the trail crossed US 11 and I-76. 
All morning I could hear gunfire from a shooting range. After crossing PA 641 the shooting grew louder. I crossed over a small knoll and the shooting range was very close to the trail. I could hear all kinds of guns going off. I could even smell the smoke from the gun powder. But at 11:30 all shooting ceased. 
I came to Boiling Springs about 1:20. I stopped at the ATC regional office but it was closed. A hiker named Travis, just starting his hike to Georgia, was there. We talked for a short time then I went to a small convenience store. I came back and talked with Travis for an hour while charging my phone. Travis just started out a few days ago but has lingered in town for two days. His pack is 60 pounds and he has no info of the trail shelters or food supplies. I felt bad for him and offered some advice. But he was confident he will finish this year and do a whole thru hike next year. We shook hands and wished each other well before heading out. 
The trail went along beautiful Children's Lake and across Breeches Creek then across more open farmland. A warm breeze flowed across the fields. The sky looked threatening as it has all day but no rain came. 
A climb up Center Point Knob and down again was easy. I met three adults and two children who could not locate the trail until I came near to them. One woman said she was so glad to see me. When she saw me she saw the white blazes and the correct direction. 
Just beyond Kennedy Shelter I saw Scab and his adult son Zip. They invited me to camp near them at a stream crossing. They enjoy socializing with thru hikers so I stopped. 
They got a fire going and we talked. I was given a drink of, I think, whiskey and Kool-Aid. 
Before hiker midnight (8 p.m.) I thanked them and retired for the night. A good day.","Wolf Trail Spring

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604338,"The day started out pretty bad. The two guys near me were asking everyone who hiked by if they wanted to party. They even went half a mile to the shelter seeking recruits. Fortunately no one was up to it. But they partied. Right up until about midnight. 
I finally dozed off but about 3:30 a.m. one of them was really really sick and I heard it on and off until 6 a.m. Enough of that story. 
After I escaped the camp the day went well. Early morning fog surrounded the trees and the high rock formations the trail went through. 
A good woods road descended to PA 34. The busy highway was reduced to one narrow lane with traffic signals at each end. I watched the signal's cycles to figure out how to get across. Finally I went just after the last car went east across the bridge. I hustled and got to the other side successfully before the traffic from the other direction came across. 
Just up the road from the trail was the Green Mountain Store and Deli. I've stopped here every time I passed through. I got a breakfast sandwich with ghost pepper cheese, coffee, two days worth of food, and a cheeseburger hoagie to go. It was just before noon. 
I ate the breakfast sandwich, packed up, got a Dr. Pepper and headed back to the trail. I was debating how long before I ate the hoagie but the abundance of mosquitoes kept me going. I followed an old railroad bed for about a half mile and both sides were buggy wetlands. 
After crossing Pine Grove Road I stopped and ate the sandwich. At the same time I noticed how hot it was getting out. The fog had disappeared around 11 a.m. and the sun was shining. Though hot it was a beautiful day. 
I stubbornly did not get water at the next creek which was the last water source until Pine Grove State Park. I thought something would be up ahead but I was wrong. Though hot and sweaty I was enjoying the easy walking through the woodlands. 
Just before the park there was a spring along the trail. I treated a liter and continued down the hill and entered the park about 3:30. 
The trail followed a bike trail and weaved through the picnic areas. I drank my water while hoping the park store was open. After going by the Pine Grove Furnace and rounding a corner there was the store and it was open. I bought the last Coke in the cooler and got a cup of chocolate ice cream. 
While sitting outside at a picnic table several people asked me about my trip. A girl at another table said she is planning to do the AT and asked me questions about gear. 
At 4:45 I knew I had to get going to make it to Tom's Run Shelter. I got a liter of water and headed out and up PA 233. The sun was low and I had difficulty seeing where the trail turned off the road but found it without too much difficulty. 
Out of the sun the air was cooler as I hiked up a long easy hill. Lots of mud today but not as bad as Vermont. 
I crossed a few stone roads then followed a gated road all the way to the shelter. I arrived at 6:33. 
Quickly I hung up my sweat laden shirts and got the tent up and gear inside. I heated water for a shower. 
Only one other person here, Just Suzie. She has a 20 year plan for hiking the trail. She came over and introduced herself. She asked if I'd lift her heavy food bag later up to a hook on the bear pole. 
As it got dark I showered behind my tent rinsing the sweat off. Then, using my headlamp, I hung my food bag on the bear pole and later put Just Suzie's up also. 
The creek is 20 feet from me. Hopefully I'll get a good night's sleep tonight.","Kennedy Shelter

I had used my headlamp to pack up but turned it off as I passed the shelter in the dark to get to the trail. Last night I saw a hiker come in after dark and I didn't want to disturb him. 
The trail began rocky but at daylight it became easier. The woods again were draped in fog. The humidity slightly labored my breathing. 
At 8:40 a.m. I saw the sign for the halfway mark! 1,095.45 complete and 1,095.45 to go. I celebrated with a pack of Caramel Cremes. 
Though there was some regular trail, most of the day I walked on old woods roads. Before Quarry Gap Shelter the trail went for miles through Mountain Laurel and stayed pretty steady. This was a beautiful section. The sun was now out and it was getting hot. 
At 2 p.m. I stopped at Quarry Gap Shelter for water. Hidden in thick rose bay rhododendrons this, I think, is the most beautiful shelter on the trail. The caretaker even brings potted flowers to decorate. 
After a rocky drop down to Caledonia State Park, the trail went through the picnic area. Again I packed up some water. 
Recent flooding in the park caused a detour but it was short and quickly I was standing along US 30. I waited five minutes before it was safe to cross the three lane highway. 
The trail went right up the mountain but the grade was moderate. I was sweating as the sun was easily shining through the sparse forest canopy. 
The trail climbed to some unique rock formations on the ridge of Rocky Mountain. At 5:15 I reached the side trail to the Rocky Mountain Shelters. 
The trail dropped steeply to the shelters, .3 of a mile down the hill. At one shelter I met Mario, hiking from Harper's Ferry, West Virginia to Harrisburg. He gave me something I never saw before. He had instant coffee with cream and sugar in it. I'll try it in the morning.
I had to descend way down again to the tenting area then way down again to get the spring water. It was close to 6 p.m. before I started setting up camp.

I was slow getting up. I tried Mario's coffee he gave me. It has sugar and cream mixed in. I liked the coffee. When I looked to see the brand the wording was all in Chinese. 
I walked up the long hill by the shelters. Some other hikers came in overnight. I said goodbye to Mario. He gave me two more packs of coffee. Then the final climb back up to the trail. On the trail at 7:15. 
The trail was pretty good and steady. Near Chimney Rock trail I met a bunch of hikers out for their weekly Tuesday hike. I asked about the towns at the state line. They said I should go into Rouzerville because Wal-Mart and a lot of restaurants are there. I asked about Blue Ridge Summit and they said not much there except a gas station, a diner, and a Dollar General. 
I dropped down to Tumbling Run Shelters. This was another beautiful shelter. I continued to a road. Before the road a lot of young kids were hiking and one asked how long I was on the trail. I told him I started June 17th. At the road I got water and continued. The next shelter was only 1.2 and I wanted the water treatment to complete its procedure before I got there. Then I remembered there is a spigot near the shelter. 
At Antietam Shelter I stopped for coffee. This shelter is old and perhaps one of the originals. I camped here on my first hike on the AT in 1977. 
I left after 11 a.m. crossing several bridges. The trail followed some old road through the forest. The smell of the autumn season was in the air. 
I came to PA 16 at 2 p.m. I decided to go to Blue Ridge Summit as it is the closest at 1.2 miles. I did not see a Dollar General on the map in that town so I thought I misunderstood the guy earlier today. Going the other direction to Rouzerville just sounded too busy a town for me. 
The three lane road was busy so I was alert as I walked the four foot paved berm. The last half mile into town the road was two lane with four foot berm and guiderails on both sides. The traffic was heavy so I needed to pay attention. 
In the little town there was a Dollar General! That's the official store of Lakeland Nidhatak. 
I stopped and purchased three days worth of food. 
I packed up outside then went to the old diner, one of those stainless steel looking places. When I walked in I was a bit nervous. All the local regulars gave me the eye. I went and sat down while still some stared. 
The Mountain Shadows Diner was clean but dated. Pictures of Elvis hung on the wall. No music was playing just the locals talking. One particularly kept his eye on me as if he never saw hiker trash before. 
I ordered a burger and fries while thinking this may not have been a good idea. But after getting my burger I was glad I stopped. This was the best burger I had on the trail so far this trip. It was real, not a prefab. I told the waitress how good it was. 
I headed out and back down the highway. I was back at the trail at 3:43. I was happy with the time and my decision to go to Blue Ridge Summit. 
I was less than three miles from the Maryland border. I was debating if I wanted to continue into Maryland today or stay at Falls Creek where I stayed in 2012. The trail made the decision for me. 
The trail climbed up a hill full of rocks and roots. I was sweating pretty good. Then down the hill was rough. Nearly two rough miles and a lot of sweat made me decide to stay at the creek. I wasn't sure what water supply was after that or where to camp plus it was 5 p.m. when I came to the footbridge over Falls Creek. 
A couple were camped there. They had the orange AT tag so I knew they were thru hikers. I think it was Jalapeno and the guy with her I met a few days ago. But I didn't want to intrude on their camp so I went downstream and out of sight. 
After setting up camp I went down to the creek and dunked myself in. I was so sweaty I didn't care how cold it was. I was refreshed. 
Right now all I hear is the creek and several birds singing as if it was the first day of spring. Another good day.","Rocky Mountain shelters

At 7 a.m. I crossed the Mason-Dixon Line and entered Maryland. A short distance later I stopped at the Penn Mar County Park. 
At the park I was hoping to find an outlet to charge my phone but all were turned off. I did find a water fountain. 
Close to 7:30 and an elderly man came into the park. He got out of his car and raised the American Flag on the flagpole. I spoke to him briefly then headed out. 
The air was warm and there was a gentle breeze. The trail followed an old railroad bed at first but then it was rocks up the hill and over for a few miles. Hiking was slow. 
After crossing MD 491 the trail climbed over a ridge then through some open fields. The sun was on me and the breeze was now stronger. 
In the afternoon the trail mostly followed old roads. The fallen leaves and the warm afternoon made the hike pleasant. Hiking was swift. 
Passed a few section hikers today. A group of young people were hiking in with climbing ropes in the late afternoon. The sky looked like rain and I wondered where they were going.
Good hiking lasted into the early evening. I descended a hill and came to the side trail to Pine Knob Shelter. It was 6:03 p.m. 
At the shelter was Billy the Kid. He is hiking from Boiling Springs, PA to Georgia. He seems confident and is doing well. He looks about 17 and not sure what direction to go in life. I hope the long journey south helps him decide.

I walked over to see Billy the Kid. He's staying due to the rain. We shook hands and I headed out getting on the trail at 7:25. 
A few minutes later I crossed over busy six lane I-70 via a pedestrian walkway. Fog was everywhere. 
At 9 a.m. I came to the Washington Monument. This was the original monument built in 1827. I made coffee as I took a break on the breezy foggy hilltop. I left around 9:30. 
An hour later I crossed Turners Gap and quickly came to Dahlgren Backpacker Campground. It was 10:30. The small camp is for AT backpackers only. The great thing is it has heated showers. I planned to stay an hour because I wanted to charge my phone. 
After taking a shower I made coffee outside and ate a bagel. At 11:30 I packed up and headed out. 
The trail had been good but became rocky around Lambs Knoll. But it changed after several miles, becoming mostly old roads the rest of the day. 
A few short showers passed through but nothing significant. It was still humid and I walked most of the day without a shirt. 
At 2:45 I dropped into Crampton Gap and walked by the towering Civil War Correspondents Memorial. 
Around 4:15 rain began. There were a few rumbles of thunder. At 4:30 it poured and the air became cooler. 
I came to the Garvey Shelter at 4:45. Four section hikers were there treating their water. They said the spring was way down the hill. 
The rain slowed so I headed down and it indeed was way down. It took 12 minutes to get to it. I came back up and treated my water while talking to the four guys. 
Two of them headed down for more water and while down there it poured. When they got back they were not happy campers. 
I checked AccuWeather and it said rain for 120 minutes. I had wanted to get two more miles in but not in this pouring rain. 
The four guys were tenting out. I decided to stay at the shelter on the second floor in case other hikers came in. Since the shelter register says there is a snake living in the rafters I decided to set up my tent. 
A good day. Not as much rain as predicted. The four guys went to their tents. Quiet now except the rain on the steel roof.","Pine Knob shelter, MD

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604543,"After dark last night a few hikers came in during a hard downpour. They were on the first floor so I didn't see who it was but I felt bad for them. Later, after the rains finally stopped the winds picked up. 
This morning strong winds hit the shelter. Branches were hitting the steel roof making it difficult to sleep. At 4:15 a.m. I decided to pack up. 
Being on the second floor of the wooden structure I was careful not to make any noise. The winds helped cover any noise I might have made. I got all my gear together then slowly opened the door trying not to have the spring make any sound. Outside I closed the door slowly and walked backwards down the steep steps. I think I was successful in not disturbing anyone. 
I was on the trail at 4:55 a.m. I was early because I did not reach my destination yesterday. Today I am to meet Southwind in Harper's Ferry. I met him as he was hiking the AT in New York and New Jersey and he invited me to stop. He is teaching after 11 a.m. so I want to stop in the morning. 
The wind was ferocious as I headed down the dark trail. I was a bit nervous. The trail was muddy and rocky. The sky was full of beautiful stars as I looked through the swaying trees. I heard a loud crash to my left in the darkness. 
My shirts were both wet so I didn't put them on but instead used my fleece jacket. My hands were a bit cold but otherwise I was warm. 
After an hour an a half the trail descended steeply via switchbacks. While going down I heard another loud crash in the woods. The wind was relentless. 
I dropped to a road and crossed it. The trail hugged an embankment of another road then a parking lot. The streetlights brightened my walk on the trail. A short time later I went under US 340 and then to the railroad tracks. Morning had arrived and I turned off my headlamp. Just after I crossed the railroad tracks an Amtrak commuter train went by, perhaps to Washington. 
I walked on the C & O Canal several miles to Harper's Ferry. On the way two trees were blown down by the winds blocking the popular trail and bike path. 
At 8:10 a.m. I crossed the Potomac River and entered West Virginia. I walked through the historic downtown and up the trail beside Jefferson's Rock. Then I took the side trail to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy office where I'll stop later. Southwind lives just a block away and he was expecting me. 
I stopped at his house about 8:45. We had breakfast and talked nearly an hour. He has a beautiful historic house overlooking the Potomac River. 
Around 10 I thanked him and said goodbye as he was to head out to teach. I walked back to the ATC office. I talked with a woman volunteer awhile. I left my pack and walked to the 7/11 for resupply. On the way I stopped at Country Cafe and they were still serving breakfast. I had a second breakfast in two hours. Then I went to the 7/11 and back to the ATC office. I saw the four guys there who tented near me last night. They said they didn't get much sleep due to the wind and fear of trees falling on them. 
I had my picture taken for the hiker catalog then packed up the food and left. I was back on the trail at 12:13. 
The trail quickly dropped to US 340 and crossed the Shenandoah River. The trail looped under the bridge then began a hill climb. After an hour I ate the foot long Italian sub I got at 7/11 and drank a Dr. Pepper. 
Later I met Double Blaze. She broke her ankle in Maine back in July and just restarted today in Harper's Ferry. 
The trail was rocky but the elevation stayed steady for miles. I crossed busy Route 9 in Keys Gap. At 5 p.m. I came to Lesser Shelter and went in for water. 
At the shelter's camping area were the four guys that tented near me last night. They invited me to come over later when they got their fire going. So, I decided to stay. 
Water was downhill a quarter of a mile. I went down, got two liters and returned to the shelter where I left my backpack. Then I found a campsite and established camp. While there, another group from Delaware invited me over to their fire. 
I went to the first fire where the four guys were. Three were from York, PA and one from Roanoke, VA. We talked and they gave me some extra food which I ate right away. Guess I was hungry today. 
Then I went over to the three guys from Delaware and talked a bit. At 7:30 I said it was close to hiker midnight and excused myself. 
A crescent moon was shiny to the south. It's chilly tonight. Haven't heard any katydids yet. I'll miss the summer sounds. ""I still can hear the whisper of the summer night. It echoes in the corner of my heart...""  from the song Desert Moon.","Garvey shelter, MD

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604584,"Rain started at 3:30 a.m. I jumped up and got out of my tent to retrieve all I had on the clothesline. Then I quickly got back into my toasty sleeping bag. 
I was up after 5. It was still raining. I started packing up after making coffee twice. The little alcohol stove also heats my tent. 
Around 6:30, just as was about to go out the rain stopped. I packed up the gear and headed out. Various tents in the campsite were lit up. Almost everyone was awake except the three from Delaware. I was on the trail at 7:09. It was windy up on the ridge. 
The rain had stopped but the trail started out with wet grass. After an hour I stopped to make hot chocolate one of the four guys who tented near the last two days gave me last night. 
I kept hiking for another hour then took a break. The four guys passed me by. Later I caught up to them at a spring. They gave me more food. 
We all headed out about the same time and I ended up ahead. Somewhere at about the same time we crossed into Virginia. There was no sign. 
At Raven Rocks I started seeing plenty of people. Day hikers were going to Raven Rocks despite the windy cool day. 
The rest of the day I hiked on what is called the Roller Coaster. It is a section about 17 miles long with constant climbs and drops. I had no problem with that but it was the horrible rocky terrain. It was slow going for the rest of the day. 
I reached Snickers Gap and busy VA 7 an hour later than I projected. It was 1 p.m. From Raven Rocks to the road I passed perhaps 70 day hikers. The four guys I tented near were visible through the trees at a distance behind me. Snickers Gap was their final destination. The four go out hiking together twice a year. 
On the other side of the highway people were hiking up to Bear Rocks, another vista. I saw 30 people in that vicinity. 
After that I saw few people. The trail was still rough and the winds continued. 
At a stream I saw two men and two women. As I went across the stream one of the guys said I must be a thru hiker because I was eating an energy bar and hopping across the the rocks at ease. The other guy had a baby on his back in a seat. They gave me Amsterdam cheese, a Natures Harvest bar and a bag of nuts with chocolate chips. I thanked them, talked a bit then continued. 
After the Moore shelter the trail got much better. The wind even was calm. I only saw one couple with their dog. 
As the sun was near the horizon I dropped down to Morgan Mill Stream and crossed the old wood bridge. I reached my destination for the day. It was 6:15 p.m. and the temperature was dropping. Might be a chilly night in the valley.","Lesser Shelter campsite, WV

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604605,"Chilly this morning. Perhaps that is why I was so slow getting on the trail. I noticed it was almost 7:30 so I hustled to get going. I was on the trail at 7:55. I wasted an hour of daylight. Today I wanted to push to get as close to US 522 as possible. I was hoping within 10 miles but not sure now with my delay in getting started. 
I still had three miles of the so called ""roller coaster"" but it was actual pretty easy. Not long afterwards I stopped at the entrance to Rod Hollow Shelter and made coffee on a fallen tree. 
At 10:45 rain began. I was surprised because rain wasn't in the forecast. At 11:15 the rain stopped. 
The trail was in good condition. I reached US 50 at noon. Then it climbed to Sky Meadows State Park going through mowed fields. After the park the trail continued in great shape. I saw many day hikers in the park. 
As the trail continued I realized I was making good time. I pushed from Whiskey Hollow Shelter to Manassas Gap Shelter and came in 20 minutes earlier than projected. Every goal I made I exceeded. I thought maybe I'll get within the 10 miles of US 522 after all. 
At VA 55 in Manassas Gap I pushed over the next hill the two miles to the next road. I thought if I could do it in an hour I might possibly reach the Denton Shelter after dark. The trail was rocky but the rocks were leveled out and trail graded. I reached the fields on top in good time. The drop down to VA 638 was easy and fast through old farm fields. I made it in good time, too. Now one more mile to the shelter. 
I climbed the next hill wondering if I should get my headlamp out. The day was cloudy so I figured darkness would come a bit earlier. It was a long graded hill but I pushed hard. At 6:45 I reached the Denton Shelter. I was now five miles from US 522. I was very surprised I made it this far today especially since I started an hour late. I hoped to get within 10 miles of the road but pleased and blessed I made it to the shelter. 
The shelter was beautiful. The yard was mowed and the shelter was clean. A nice front porch with Adirondack chairs. A pavilion and horseshoe pits. Even a spring fed shower which I didn't try since it was cold out. 
I got water then found a campsite. Then put the tent up and gear inside without using a headlamp. 
A beautiful night. No one is at the shelter. All I hear are crickets. 
Tomorrow is a town day. At US 522 it is three miles into Front Royal, Virginia, hence my push to get as close to the highway as possible.","Morgan Mill Stream, VA
","Denton Shelter, VA","Oct 14, Sun",21.70
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604628,"Rain started early this morning. When I began packing up the rain slowed. It was warmer than yesterday. I was on the trail at 6:25. 
The start to hiking was in the dark, the fog and the rain. My headlamp was weak as I forgot to get new batteries at the Dollar General last week. 
Daylight arrived and the rain continued. The trail began rocky and muddy but it became better and eventually a good old road. About 8 a.m. the rain stopped. 
Just before US 522 I put away my rain gear. I reached the highway about 9 a.m. 
The berm of the busy road was only two feet wide. I walked against traffic for awhile until there was a pull off on the opposite of the road. Then I'd cross over and hitch hike. I tried that several times but no ride. To think I shaved, washed my hair, and sprayed Deep Woods Off on my arm pits...all for nothing. 
It was just three miles into town and I got there just after 10 but not without causing trouble. A dog ran out and crossed the road towards me. It was a big fat mutt. I used my trekking poles to defend from a potential attack. The dog was running back and forth. A woman called with little concern for the dog. Traffic slowed and after the last close barking from the dog it retreated in front of a truck. I didn't look but it apparently made it back after nearly bringing traffic to a halt. 
I went to McDonald's for breakfast then went and did laundry. After that I went in the rain to Dollar General for food then to Super 8. I got a room but couldn't check in until 2 p.m. So I went a mile to the post office and then to Mountain Trails outfitter for fuel. 
After checking into the motel I went for more items at the Martin's grocery store and to Fox's Pizza for a meat supreme pizza. A lot of walking around town on my own to day. My day was done. Time to relax.","Denton Shelter, VA

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604635,"For breakfast I had coffee, a banana, and my last piece of meat supreme pizza. I packed up and left the hotel at 8:20. 
A short time later a woman moving boxes around in her car asked me if I needed a ride to the trail. I said ""Yes!"" 
Susie works at the Smithsonian property which borders the trail and is familiar with hikers. The Smithsonian has rare animals on the grounds she said. 
She took me right to the trail crossing. I thanked her and she gave me a hug. I started on the trail at 8:30! 
The trail started on boardwalks as it went along the Smithsonian fence. Later it climbed a mountain on switchbacks. I saw two brothers in their 50's hiking from Waynesboro to Harper's Ferry. Later I saw two older guys section hiking, all heading north. 
I stopped at the Floyd Wayside shelter. Earlier I saw signs to a spring as I climbed up a switchback but I ignored them and went straight to the shelter. Then I found out I had to walk all the way down the mountain to where I saw the first signs for the spring. I went down and found the spring. The water was only deep enough to fill up half the bottle. So, I used the bottle's cap to scoop up the water. It took 100 scoops. 
At 11:11 I entered Shenandoah National Park. After filling out and issuing my own permit I tied it on my backpack with the metal ties it came with. 
The trail in the park was in good shape. Most of the time the trail followed old roads. A few vistas gave good views west and south. 
Sometimes I think I'm a magnet for drawing strange people to talk to me. One was today. A white haired woman came by going north with her black lab. She talked about a body being dropped off in the park. Then she mentioned a hiker found dead in his tent in Florida. According to her a bear killed a dog in the park while the dog was on a leash. She pointed out my bandanna I have on one of my trekking poles. She pointed to a camouflage one around her neck. She says it camouflages her from the bears. O......K......got to go. 
The trail was great. The woods were quiet except for an occasional vehicle on Skyline Drive. 
At 4:45 I dropped down to Gravel Springs Hut (they call them huts in the park but they are just regular style shelters). I got water at Gravel Spring then sat down at the picnic table. I debated about continuing but decided to stay. It is a good climb up the next hill and I'd be camping 700 feet higher. Higher means colder. 
I went up behind the shelter to one of the campsites. I placed my food up the bear pole. After setting up camp and getting in my tent I heard a lot of banging down at the shelter's metal bear box. I decided I had to investigate fearing it was a bear. As I went down I saw a headlamp in the shelter and it was Finn, a Sobo. We talk a few minutes then I retired to my tent as darkness fell. In the distanced I heard Barred Owls. Haven't heard them in quite a while. 
Today I went over North Marshall Mountain, the first mountain over 3,000 feet since northern Massachusetts. Also, a few days back, I hit the 1,000 miles to go mark. As of tonight I've hiked 1,233 miles on the AT and have 957 to go.","Front Royal, VA

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604650,"This morning was not as cold as I expected. I easily packed and headed up the hill to the trail in the dark. On the way glowing eyes startled me but it turned out to be a buck. Arrived at the trail at 6:20. 
Just up the trail about half a mile more glowing eyes. This critter looked like a big moving shadow. It was a bear and it was heading away from me. 
Though it wasn't too cold at the shelter last night, once I reached the ridge it was windy. The wind would last all day. 
Around 9:30 I stopped at Elkwallow Wayside. I got a cup of coffee and a cinnamon roll with thick white icing on top. I went outside and had my breakfast. Just as I was going back into the store I saw the lady I met yesterday. She talked and talked. I went in the store for another cinnamon roll and free coffee refill, bringing them back outside to the picnic table. She talked and talked. 
Finally I headed out. The trail was great all day except for a short section. The rest of the trail was on old roads or on a well constructed treadway. 
I crossed Thornton Gap after 3. Briefly I took off my outer shirt because it seemed warmer in the gap with the sun shining on me. But climbing out of the gap the winds picked up and I was cold again. Then for two miles the trail remained on the east side of the mountain out of the wind. That was a pleasant break. 
The trail from Thornton's Gap was graded and well constructed. Stone walls lined the edge of the trail. I suspect this was built by the CCC back in the 1930's. 
When I reached the top I was back in the wind again. Initially this morning I was going to go to Byrd's Nest #3 Hut at 18 miles, then decided to push for 20 miles instead. But just before the hut I decided to stay at the hut because I figured it would be out of the wind being down the side of the mountain. When I got to the hut it was right on the ridge, right in the wind. The campsites were nearby in the wind also. The spring was .3 down the mountainside. I pushed on, hoping after the picnic area up ahead I'd find a shielded campsite. 
The trail was graded up and over the Pinnacles.  It took less than an hour to reach the Pinnacles Picnic Area. I knew there was water there and I was glad to find it wasn't turned off for the season. 
Finn came by and stopped to get water also. We were getting whipped by the cold wind. I put my fleece vest and fleece jacket on. 
Finn said he hopes to get to the lodge 4 miles ahead so he could sit in the bar to stay warm. He couldn't believe how windy and cold it was. Neither could I. We are in the south! 
Finn went on ahead. I wanted to get a mile or two away from the picnic area and out of the wind. Like at the huts, the picnic area had bear warning signs all over and there was a bear trap there. 
I hiked onward longer than I hoped to. As I walked the sun was setting slightly to my right. The orange glow turned some of the trees and leaves orange as well. Then the orange ball disappeared. A half moon to my left got brighter and brighter. 
I saw no campsites as the trail dropped steadily. Thick mountain laurel on both sides of the trail made me worry as I was running out of daylight. The trail climbed up and the mountain laurel disappeared. As the trail leveled out and intersected with another trail I saw flat open woodlands. It was 7 p.m. 
I got the tent up without using my headlamp because my eyes adjusted to the fading light gradually. I learned to use my night vision in the army. 
The winds continue. To the west a golden horizon. Behind me a bright moon. Another good day.","Gravel Springs Hut

On the trail at 7:21. I had my rain gear over my jacket and vest. I warmed up quickly and put away the rain jacket. Yesterday I bought a wool cap at Elkwallow and I was utilizing it today. 
The trail was great all day. Sometimes it climbed steeper than usual but it was still a good grade. Lots of vistas from the ridges. The wind made it cold. 
I passed at least 10 backpackers today. One guy, Lucas, kept passing me by. The last time he said since we keep running into each other we should tell each other our names which we did. 
I didn't see Finn all day. He was going to the breakfast buffet at Skyland at 7:30. Thought he'd pass me somewhere. 
In the afternoon I stopped at Big Meadows Wayside. Big meadows indeed! Beautiful fields along Skyline Drive. Beautiful and windy. 
At the busy wayside I got a burger, fries, and a Dr. Pepper. Then, as I sat outside at the windy picnic table, I remembered my purpose for coming here was to get a hot coffee. So, I went in and got a $3 coffee. 
I headed down Skyline Drive and down the stone service road to the trail. As I walked it was getting warmer. The winds died down to a gentle breeze. I was back to shorts and long sleeve top with my fleece vest. 
I passed lots of day hikers. Seems there are a lot of vistas people hike into. I even ran into the chatty lady I've seen the last two days. I couldn't get a word in or, if I tried, I got cut off. I started walking and said ""Maybe I'll see you tomorrow"" to escape. 
I came to the trail leading downhill to Bearfence Mountain Hut. As soon as I began descending I felt the cold. Once down to the hut I got water from the spring. A guy and a girl were eating at the hut. Their tents were up the hill. I looked at the tent sites and decided to move on and up to higher ground. It was cold down in that valley. 
Up on the trail I wanted to stop at the first site I saw. But then I entered a no camping area due to being close to Lewis Mountain Campground. Lots of campers and campfires as the trail looped near them. I saw the sun set directly up the trail at a straight section. I hoped for a quick campsite because I didn't want to set up in the dark like last night. 
I came to the sign indicating the end of the no camping area. I saw a flat spot just up from the sign maybe 50 feet into the woods. I was happy and got set up quickly. 
Once again an orange horizon to the west and a bright half moon to the southeast. No wind now. Very quiet except occasional human noises from the campground.","Hughes River Gap

The sun was out and strong. It wasn't long before I decided to take off my rain gear, jacket and gloves. 
The trail continued traversing the mountains gently weaving through the forest. A bit chilly but a beautiful October day in the Shenandoahs. 
I didn't see anyone hiking I knew. I did see two Nobo section hikers and later three more. 
At 11:24 I reached Swift Run Gap at US 33. This is the end of today's hike. My trail journals transcriber Clark and his wife Heidi will host me for the night. Their son Sterling hiked the Eastern Continental Trail as I did in 2012. Clark picked us up in 2012 and took us home. 
Today Clark picked me up and we went to his home once again near Charlottesville. After getting a shower Clark and Heidi treated me to lunch at Vinny's Italian restaurant. Later Clark took me for groceries. On the way he rescued a Snapping turtle on the road. After stopping for groceries at Food Lion we went to Advanced Auto for Heet. Heet is a fuel I can use if denatured alcohol is unavailable. Then we headed home. 
While it is a treat being hosted by Clark and Heidi there was a special treat when I got to see and talk to Sterling via Skype. Sterling is married, lives in Paris, France, and has a son and daughter. It was an enjoyable time reminiscing about our experiences in 2012. 
Later Clark and I went to Which Wich Superior Sandwiches. Back at the house Heidi, Clark and I ate our sandwiches while having pleasant conversation. 
Before 7 p.m. I headed to my room to do my journal, call Heartrock, and go to sleep.

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604752,"Before sunrise Heidi and I went to a bagel store for take out breakfast sandwiches and three bagels for my hike. Back home Clark joined us for breakfast. 
After breakfast I thanked Heidi as Clark and I headed back to the trail via US 33 about half hour away. I had trouble with my leg all morning and when I got out of Clark's SUV at the park entrance I wasn't sure I could even walk that far. Clark suggested a leg stretch for me and I did it. The leg felt so much better. I had to do the exercise several times during the day. I thanked Clark and headed for the park entrance. 
At the entrance I was asked if I had a pass so I showed the AT permit. She said that's a permit not a pass. I had to pay $15 to reenter the park which was fine with me because I have enjoyed my time there. 
As I crossed the bridge over US 33 I saw it was 8:30 a.m. Clark said he'd get me on the trail by 8:30 and he did. 
The sky looked like rain could occur at any moment. When I reached the vista on top of Hightop Mountain the sky was clearing. 
The trail was excellent all day as it went up mountains and dropped through the gaps. The sun even came out for most of the afternoon. I was hiking in shorts and a sleeveless top. People commented how beautiful the day was. 
Though being a Saturday, I didn't see many people. I saw a few backpackers and a few day hikers. At Simmons Gap I saw a biker going down Skyline Drive with another person on the front. I thought it was strange. But later at Pinefield Hut a section hiker there named Lost and Found said the guys on the bike were biking to Argentina. Somehow both can pedal. 
After Ivy Creek Overlook I met Josh and his dogs. One a Doberman Pinscher and the other a little tiny thing. Josh was a Nobo on the AT this year and finished September 1st. The little dog hiked the trail with him but not the Doberman. A short time later I met Judy, a day hiker. She gave me a persimmon cookie. I never had persimmons before but it was good. 
After dropping to and crossing Ivy Creek the trail followed along the creek's banks for half a mile. Though the ridge walking was beautiful, this was a pleasant change. 
The trail left the creek and headed up Loft Mountain. The wind had picked up significantly. I stopped at a spring off the trail. The water was gushing out of the white PVC pipe. I like piped springs because of the ease in filling up the bottles. 
I went another mile to Frazier Discovery Trail junction. The cement post read it was 1.3 miles to the campground. It was 5:30. (These cement posts have a stainless steel band wrapped around it. Information is indented on the band. The lettering is small so I have to get real close and squint to read it.) I wanted to get to the camp store because I had a craving for milk. But I thought once I got to the store I'd still have to continue a half mile beyond the campground and it might be dark by then. So, a few hundred feet beyond the intersection I found a campsite out of the wind and settled in for the night. 
I've used bear boxes and bear posts before but haven't bear bagged on this trip until tonight. My method in getting the food bag up on the branch is to tie the bear rope around a rock and toss it over a branch. For me it takes several frustrating times to do it. After three attempts I was successful. I pulled the food bag up and secured the other end of the rope to another tree. 
Despite the leg issue it was a very good day. I am grateful beyond words for the help and hospitality Clark and Heidi provided. The weather was great especially with the warm up. The trail was gentle and beautiful. And I met a few nice people along the trail today. Another blessed day.","Charlottesville

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604772,"Around 11:30 last night rain or sleet pounded the tent. The wind was fierce in the treetops but I was somewhat protected from any direct wind. The rain lasted a half hour. 
This morning it was cold and windy. Checking AccuWeather there was a high wind warning overnight until 8 a.m. this morning. 
I used the alcohol stove to heat my tent multiple times. I retrieved my food bag and placed it on my sleeping bag only to find it and the contents wet. All food inside was sealed so no damage but now a wet area on my sleeping bag. 
On the trail at 7:15. It wasn't too far to a side trail that read .5 to Loft Mountain Wayside. The book says it serves breakfast so I went down. Unfortunately a sign on the door said it didn't open until 9. So, back to the trail. 
The trail went on the east side of the ridge out of the wind. I took a break and enjoyed the morning sunshine. After continuing on the trail it crossed the ridge and remained on the west side most of the day. It would be a cold and windy hike on that side. 
I was surprised to see so many day hikers especially those heading up to the open summit of Blackrock Mountain. It was cold! 
The trail was well graded and beautiful again today. The leaves were changing to a yellow. I only saw one maple tree displaying red leaves. 
Like yesterday, the trail would climb a mountain then drop to a gap then repeat. Sometimes the trail would lead me through a vista along Skyline Drive. 
Near the end of the park the trail followed along a stream before a steep climb out. I saw no indication of the southern boundary of the park but the deterioration of the trail indicated I crossed the boundary. The excellent trail in the park spoiled me. Now it's back to rocks, roots, steep climbs and descents. 
Climbing up Calf Mountain I could feel the temperature drop. The winds continued. At 6:10 I reached the trail to the shelter which was .3 off the AT. At .2 on the side trail was a piped spring. How nice to get water before the shelter and carry it to the camp instead of getting to the shelter and hiking down the mountain for water. I've done that too many times. 
I didn't expect anyone at the shelter but I could smell smoke as I got close. Three older guys were in the shelter who are heading north doing 80 miles. Also there was Tag Along section hiking and waiting for a friend to come in. 
I got my tent up quickly. It was cold and windy. Tonight is to be in the 20's. I went back to the shelter to talk to the guys a bit. I showed Tag Along how to drop the rain fly along the sides of the tent to keep the wind and cold out. Then I went back to my tent. I used my stove to heat the inside until I got situated. I'm prepared for a cold night though I'll be toasty in my sleeping bag. How to get up and going in the morning remains to be seen. But I've done it before. Plus I have an incentive: Clark will meet me in 8 miles to take me into Waynesboro. Tonight I'll be dreaming about eating hot town food and drinking a hot coffee. 
Yesterday I passed a milestone: I'm now under 900 miles left to hike. As of tonight I've hiked 1,320 miles with 870 to go.","Frazier Discovery Trail Junction

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604824,"My thermometer read 35 degrees inside the tent. I started my little alcohol stove just outside the tent and under the rain fly. The fuel was HEET not denatured alcohol and it burned hot. The tent thermometer read 90 degrees after the first burn. But it quickly dropped until I fueled it up again. It only burns for five minutes or so. 
With the warmth I got dressed and packed up slowly. It was so quiet in the camp. Not a creature was stirring not even a mouse. Plastic bags are loud when cold so I carefully and quietly packed up. 
I was on the trail just before 7 a.m. It wasn't long until I could shut the headlamp off. The trail was steep and rocky. But at the top of Calf Mountain the trail became well groomed. On top of Little Calf Mountain open fields allowed me to see the bright orange morning sun rising. The trail remain good for several miles. 
After McCormick Gap the trail became rough with short steep ups and downs. Going up one steep section as I was looking at the ground when something made me look up real fast. A seven point buck came onto the trail. He walked slowly in front of me then stepped off and watched me from just off the trail. Like most of the Shenandoah deer he had little fear of humans. 
I arrived at Rockfish Gap about 11:15, just under 8 miles. A short time later Clark pulled up. He pointed out inside the SUV were onion bagels Heidi sent along for me. After loading my gear we first went to Rockfish Gap Outfitters for fuel, AquaMira, and some energy bars. Then we went into Waynesboro to Healthy Habits to pick up some Turmeric Root Piperine that Clark suggested for my knee and leg. Afterwards I resupplied at Kroger. After we finished the shopping spree Clark treated at Weasie's for lunch. I had the meatloaf special. Now I've stopped at Weasie's for all my four thru hikes. 
We headed back up the mountain to the trail. We had a little trouble locating the trail after the bridge over US 250. We saw a double blaze on a post but nothing after that. After parking I repacked my gear while Clark looked around and we figured it was down along the Blue Ridge Parkway. I thanked Clark for his wonderful assistance helping me resupply today. 
I went down to the parkway and a man pulled in to day hike. He thru hiked in 1990 and said hello. I asked him where the trail went after the last double blaze and he said right over the guardrails. So, I went up and over. It was about 2:20. 
The trail was good all the way to Wolfe Shelter. The guy I saw earlier had passed me on the way, then on his way back told me where to camp. I told him I was going beyond the shelter and he suggested Glass Hollow Overlook. I thanked him and continued. 
At Wolfe Shelter I stopped for water. What a beautiful spot. A creek full of cascades a short distance down the hill in view from the shelter. 
While treating the water I ate one of the bagels. I felt a bit teary eyed in appreciation for all Clark and Heidi did for me. Heidi even sliced the bagels for me! 
The trail went up the mountain via multiple easy switchbacks. After two miles I came to the side trail to Glass Hollow Overlook. I went out the short blue blazed trail to the vista. A large campsite there and a gorgeous view eastward. It was 6:15. 
Temperature was in the 50's and only a slight breeze. What a great spot. I hope to capture the rising moon tonight and the sunrise in the morning.","Calf Mountain Shelter

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604870,"The moon was beautiful last night. It was mild overnight. This morning I packed up and waited for the sunrise. It was a beautiful morning watching the changing colors in the clouds then finally the sunrise. I'm glad I camped here. 
I could hear wind up on the ridge as I headed up to the AT. I started on the trail at 7:47 a.m. The trail was good all the way to the first crossing of the Blue Ridge Parkway. I got water there in a spring next to the road. It was a little windy. 
After the road crossing, the trail hugged the mountainside for four rocky miles. I had been thinking of going to Harper's Creek Shelter today but after the late start and rough trail I thought at least I'd get within a few miles. 
The trail crossed the parkway at Three Ridges Overlook then began climbing Three Ridges Mountain. The afternoon was sunny, breezy and warm. The trail was good. After a drop near Maupin Field Shelter the trail climbed steeply up through rocks and mountain laurel. I estimated I'd get to the top at 5 p.m. I arrived at 5:01 very pleased. 
After walking the flat top of the mountain there was a sign. It read 3.2 miles to Harpers Creek Shelter. I might make it after all I thought. 
Oh, the trail dropped and dropped. I estimate 30 to 40 switchbacks down the rocky side of the mountain. After an hour and a half the trail became a regular trail, a dirt treadway, not rocks. 
The sun disappeared behind 4,063 foot The Priest, which I'll climb tomorrow. The trail continued its descent weaving in and out of hollows. 
At 6:43 I came to a sign hard to read in the fading light. It pointed to the right and read ""Shelter."" I made it. No way could I have camped within a mile or two if I was later as there was no place to camp on that steep descent. So glad to reach the shelter. 
No one at the shelter. No surprise since I saw only 10 people hiking today. I camped on a high bank across the creek from the shelter. I pulled two liters of water from the creek then put up my tent in the dark. I didn't need my headlamp until I got in the tent. 
A day not real exciting but a good day. Grateful I made it 20 miles after not expecting to do that. 
Tomorrow a 3,066 foot climb up The Priest. I think the last time I had a climb like that was up Mount Moosilauke in New Hampshire.","Glass Hollow Overlook

After crossing Harper's Creek and climbing some I saw an orange eye on the trail reflecting from my headlamp. It was just a rabbit. It ran side to side on the trail before finally deciding to head down the hillside. At 7 a.m. I could turn my light out. 
I left the Three Ridges Wilderness at the Tye River. A long suspension bridge crossed the river and bounced as I walked. It was 8 a.m. 
The trail crossed a highway and entered The Priest Wilderness. It would be a 4.2 mile climb going up 3,066 feet to the top of the Priest which stands at 4,063 feet. Just after I started a day hiker who I saw yesterday went by me climbing. He said he was going to Spy Rock and back. 
The trail was excellent all the way to the top. Sometimes I was in the sun and hot and at other times in the wind and cold. I estimated I'd be at the top at 10 but didn't get there until 10:43. It was windy and cold at the wooded summit. 
Just after the Priest shelter I dropped down some. A guy backpacking was coming up. He was sweating and I was cold. He said he has to take a layer off and I said I have to put a layer on. 
Later near Spy Rock I saw the day hiker coming back. He said he day hikes the AT on his vacations. I continued and bypassed Spy Rock because of the wind. The trail dropped down an old road and there I saw a backpacker struggling, it seemed, to get up the hill. His head was down and he was stopped. When he saw me he started hiking again and we exchanged hellos. 
Throughout the afternoon I did not see another soul. The trail was great though I did get cold at times. 
Towards the end of the day the sun was low and sometimes made it hard to see. But several times I was amazed at the beauty of the sunlight highlighting the orange and brown colors of the leaves and the ferns. A beautiful sight. 
I heard a Barred Owl in the afternoon. Wildlife otherwise was scarce. Besides hearing the owl and seeing the confused bunny the only other critters moving about were squirrels. 
My goal was Hog Camp Gap but by early afternoon I knew I wouldn't make it. Perhaps it was the long climb up the Priest. I decided to stop at Salt Log Gap. 
When I reached the gap at 5:45 I was surprised to see someone camped there. He was a Nobo hiking from Catawba, VA to Harper's Ferry, WV. He said I could camp there but the space was small so I declined. I saw a flat area 100 feet further and went there instead. 
As the sun was setting I established my camp for the evening. A gorgeous sunset tonight. Another good day.","Harper's Creek, VA

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604912,"The moon lit up the tent overnight. I packed up and was on the trail at 6:36 a.m. The trail switchbacked up Tar Jacket Ridge. Sometimes the moon was in front of me and sometimes behind me. To the east the horizon was getting brighter. I saw the white tails of four deer running through the woods. 
On top of the ridge it was mowed all the way to Hog Camp Gap. When I first came to the top the sun was just popping up over the mountains. To the west the moon was still bright and the clouds were turning pink and purple. 
I walked the fields in the morning light seeing four more deer. The ridge was cool and there was a slight breeze. The grass along the trail was covered with white frost. Sometimes I heard a crunching sound from my feet on frozen soil. 
Going up Bald Knob was slow as well as the descent to US 60. The trail was ancient and rocky. But after US 60 the trail was excellent the rest of the day. 
A beautiful walk down Brown Mountain Creek. I saw Finn signed the register at the shelter there. The trail continued down the stream and around a reservoir. 
After crossing Pedlar River on a suspension bridge the trail climbed for a few miles to the Blue Ridge Parkway. I earlier estimated I'd make it to Punchbowl Shelter at 5 p.m., my original destination for the day. I decided to go beyond the shelter maybe three miles since I'd get there early. That's when I noticed the place I wanted to go to was the same name as the place I camped yesterday just spelled as one word; Saltlog Gap. Yesterday was Salt Log Gap. The data book also indicated yesterday as north and today as south. 
Anyway, made it to the shelter at 5:08. I picked up two liters of water. Just like yesterday, I got water and transported it three miles to my campsite. I left the shelter at 5:30. I put my headlamp around my neck in case I got to Saltlog Gap after dark. From the shelter it was 1.6 miles to the top of Bluff Mountain with an elevation climb of 891 feet then another 1.5 miles down to the gap. 
The climb over Punchbowl Mountain was easy. The trail was beautiful going through the fall foliage displayed along the trail. Going up Bluff Mountain was steeper but still good trail. 
At the top was the foundation of an old fire tower. Nearby was the memorial to Ottie Powell. He was not yet five years old when he strayed away from school in November 1891. He was found on Bluff Mountain in April 1892, some seven miles from the school. 
The trail dropped on long well built switchbacks. The sun disappeared in the clouds. When the trail turned west on one of the switchbacks I saw a bright orange sky. 
I arrived at the gap at 6:53. It was getting dark but I got the tent up without using my headlamp. I did have to use it to put the stakes in the ground. A good day of nearly 23 miles.","Salt Log Gap

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604929,"Initially I wanted to get to Daleville on Tuesday, but with good mileage the last two days I told myself if I could get there Monday I could have a zero day on Tuesday. All looked pretty easy until I heard it might rain Friday. Friday I wanted to blitz into and out of Glasgow with my resupply. I thought my plans might end up not working out. 
Last night (Thursday) Heartrock told me the weather for Glasgow. She said 100% chance of rain amounting up to 3/4 of an inch. She said the rain will start at 9 a.m. As I went to sleep I was anxious and almost dismissed my challenge of getting to Daleville Monday. My mind was busy, it's always doing things I don't even know about. Then an idea! 
IF I can get to the road early enough (7.4 miles), hitch into Glasgow, get my resupply then hitch out before it rains, I could get to the first shelter to stay and keep dry then get an early start Saturday. If rain starts early I probably have to stay in Glasgow at the hostel getting a late start Saturday, dashing my chances to get to Daleville Monday. 
At 3:15 a.m. today (Friday) I gave the command to proceed with the mission. I was on the trail at 4:12 a.m. There was a slight breeze but I ended up taking my jacket off going up the first hill. 
I saw a glowing eye that turned out to be a rabbit. All the way my headlamp would reflect on something blue/green on the treadway. It was very small. When I saw a moving one I got closer to the ground to investigate. The glow was my headlamp reflecting on spiders. 
The trail was well built all the way down. I first climbed 400' to the top of Big Rocky Row at 2,974' then a descent of 2,234' down to the highway and the James River at just 680' elevation. 
Plenty of switchbacks on the way down but easy to navigate even in the dark. I only fell once. 
I saw the moon briefly as the clouds were coming in. Due to the clouds I used the headlamp until 7:10. I continued along Lower Rocky Run crossing two bridges and arrived at US 501 at 7:40. Good timing. 
The road had no paved berms so I hitched at a pull off. No takers for ten minutes. I began to walk and hitch. If I had to walk the six miles into town I will, I thought. Before I started walking I hid my trekking poles off the road in the weeds near the trail head parking lot. At two pull offs nearly a mile up the road I had success. A Prius pulled over and gave me a ride at 8:20. The retired clock repairman hikes and frequently gives hikers rides. The road was narrow with plenty of curves. He said too dangerous to walk it. He took me to Glasgow and dropped me off at the Stop & Go convenience store. I thanked him and headed to Dollar General which was nearby. 
I got four days of food and headed back to the convenience store for a coffee. It was 8:35 and the rain started. At the store I got a coffee and donuts then went outside under an overhang. 
If I wanted to hitch I'd have to go across a long highway bridge over the James River to get back to US 501. I wondered how hard it would rain and how long I'd stand there. I checked the radar and it looked bleak. For Glasgow there was an empty square on the map. It wasn't showing the radar for some reason. But all around it was yellows and reds, heavy rain. 
I decided to call the hostel and ask for a shuttle back to the trail. I can walk from there to the shelter in the rain. I called the hostel to ask about a ride and the guy said maybe. He  told me to walk to the hostel then ask the driver if he could take me to the trail head. I said okay. Just then a young guy came out of the store and asked if I wanted a ride to the trail. I said ""Yes!!"" 
We got back on US 501 and weaved through the mountains. He constantly shifted the old Ford's standard transmission as we rounded the corners. He also gives hikers rides frequently. He gave a ride to Honeybear and Flash whom I hiked with in Maine and New Hampshire. 
When we pulled into the trail head parking lot it was raining pretty well. I thanked the guy and we shook hands. He headed back to Glasgow. He went out of his way to give me a ride. It was 9:10 a.m! I blitzed in and out of town in less than an hour! Amazing! 
In the stone parking lot I super quickly pulled out all my rain gear. I covered my pack with the poncho then left it on the ground. I had to go back to retrieve my trekking poles. 
Back to the parking lot I got all the rain gear on and headed out in the rain. Under the railroad bridge I paused briefly to take a picture of the James River Foot Bridge. Then climbed the steps and walked the bridge over the river. 
The trail followed the river upstream for about a mile then turned and ascended Matt's Creek. I arrived at the shelter in light rain around 10:30 a.m. The mission was a success! Daleville Monday! 
This is the fifth time I stayed in a shelter on this trip and all were due to rain. I had bought instant mashed potatoes because I knew I'd need something to warm me up once I reached the shelter. I heated and ate the potatoes as I contemplated what to do. I could go on but it is a good climb. Plus tomorrow I'd end up with lots of wet gear if I continued and tented. This was the goal and I made it and I need to be content. 
I got my tent set up in the shelter to help stay warm. Then I took a nap. 
At 2:30 I woke up to voices. A man and woman stopped. I assumed they were going to stay but they didn't. This is a planned three day hiking weekend and they were heading up the ridge. They acknowledged it is to rain harder later. 
As we talked I felt so lazy staying here and in my tent. After they left I again contemplated moving on. I made coffee and a short time later heavy rain started. I'll stay put. 
As of 6 pm the rain remains steady as it has for hours. I feel concerned for the man and woman who passed through. They were continuing several more miles which would be a few more hours in this rain. They are climbing about 1,800' higher. It is raw here. I can't imagine hiking up there being wet and cold. 
I'll head out early in the morning, rain or shine. One person said rain will stop tonight and another said 9 a.m. tomorrow. Must push if I want that zero day in Daleville. 
Not a good day weather-wise but a good and interesting day otherwise. Very blessed. All I hear is the rain on the roof and the rain splashing in the puddles in front of the shelter.","Saltlog Gap (south)

At 6:20 I left the shelter, crossed the creek and began the climbing for the day. I started at 835' and will reach Apple Orchard Mountain at 4,206' later today. 
At 7:10 I turned the headlamp off. I had my rain gear on and was waiting for daylight to see if any rain clouds were lingering. 
It was breezy all day. Fog would last until 11 a.m. Around 9:30 I talked to the man and woman who hiked beyond the shelter in the rain yesterday. They said they got soaked. They arrived at Marble Spring, their campsite, at 5:30 last night. They said once they had their tents up they stayed dry. 
I continued climbing with some descents every now and then. The rain brought down many leaves overnight, mostly maples. The oaks are holding on. 
A man and twin women went by, day hiking. Then a group of Boy Scouts. I forgot it was the weekend.
At the Guillotine (see picture) two hikers caught up to me. As I continued they disappeared. Up and over Apple Orchard Mountain in the clouds. At 4,206' this is the highest mountain since Moosilauke in New Hampshire. 
I stopped to check time and mileage. I thought I won't make it to my goal of getting to Bryant Ridge Shelter. It was a long steady climb to this point but I wasn't doing as well as I thought I should, especially after an easy day yesterday. Sometimes the clouds were dark making me think rain would start at any moment. 
I kept going, pushing to the next shelter, Cornelius Creek Shelter in four miles. The trail has been good almost all day. I pushed and arrived at the side trail to that shelter at 5:02 p.m. I took a break to think. It was 4.9 miles to Bryant Ridge. I figured I'd see what the trail is like and maybe camp a few miles before the shelter if I found water. 
The trail was great. The grade up Floyd Mountain was easy. Then it was gentle switchbacks down. The trail leveled out winding through the woodlands. I was cruising. Besides the noise of my feet and trekking poles all I could hear were train whistles in the distance. I love that sound when I'm hiking. 
After dropping off of Bryant Ridge the trail again had good switchbacks. I hiked as fast as I could as the darkness fell. I was enjoying my hike immensely. 
At 7:01 I had to turn my headlamp on. At 7:22 I reached a T intersection and to the right a sign to the shelter. I made it. I found no water between the two shelters so I would have had to come here no matter what. 
It was a tenth of a mile to the shelter. At the shelter a light came on and a girl spoke. Two girls were there and they are thru hiker Sobos. I heard about them a week ago. They told me where to camp. 
I got water first then went to the campsite. Unfortunately all the sites were on a hill and very slanted. I decided to head back to the AT. 
Back at the T intersection I went straight. The trail crossed a creek and began a super steep climb. I thought this can't be the trail. I looked but didn't find any trail markers. I then went back to the T intersection. 
The trail I thought was the side trail to the shelter was the AT. So, I headed back towards the shelter. Just before the shelter the AT turned left. I was glad I found the trail and not have to ask the girls where it was. 
I followed the creek for a tenth of a mile and found a site next to the stream. It was about 8 p.m. I was beat. It was warm in the narrow valley. Tonight I'll sleep well, especially with the sound of the stream next to me.","Matt's Creek Shelter

On the trail at 6:54. I could hear train horns right away. Since I messed up on some of the trail last night, plus since I arrived in the dark and left in the dark, I was somewhat worried if I was on the AT. In the dark a light blue blaze could look white. Then the words from the end of the song Nights in White Satin repeated in my head: ""Cold-hearted orb that rules the night, removes the colours from our sight, red is grey and yellow white, but we decide which is right, and which is an illusion.""  
As daylight arrived the color was white and all was right. The hike goes forth. 
A big drop down to Jennings Creek and then a good climb out. It was chilly and breezy. Cove Mountain was the big climb for the day but it was well graded. The trees on the mountain changed to pine surrounded by thick mountain laurel. 
Around noon the sun came out. Still breezy but a beautiful day. From a vista the mountains look more orange today. I could hear a train blowing its horn as it traveled along the James River down below the mountains. 
After ascending out of Bearwallow Gap I found a big rock and took a break. I made garlic mashed potatoes for lunch. I wanted to have a full stomach to push on this afternoon. The terrain looked good now that the big ascents and descents are done for the day. 
The wind died down and the temperature increased as the sun stayed out. I hiked in shorts and a long sleeve top. The trail was good, sometimes following old roads. 
As the trail followed an old road it came out to Harvey's Knob Overlook on the Blue Ridge Parkway. I stopped for a break on one of the three large boulders blocking the old road. 
A white van at the overlook came my way and stopped. A guy got out and asked if I was a thru hiker. I said yes as he walked towards me. As he talked to me I was eating a slice of Spam. I planned to toss the wrapper in the trash can at the overlook so not to draw bears later tonight. 
Joel asked why I didn't have a beard. I said I like to be clean. I told him some thru hikers think I'm not a thru hiker because I'm clean. 
He offered me fruit and I asked if he had water. I've been out of water for some time and it was five miles to the shelter. He said yes. 
He walked back to his van and got a water bottle from his wife. I met him halfway from the van to the rock with my water bottle which he filled. He also gave me a banana and an apple. I thanked them and told them they made my day. They have a friend who thru hiked and were eager to help hikers. He said ""God bless you"" as he got back in the van. They waved and were smiling as they drove away. 
After eating the fruit I deposited all my trash in the trash can. I crossed the parkway and followed the trail. It would cross the parkway several more times before the trail headed the mountain. 
While still on top I saw the clouds to the west and they looked like rain. At 4 p.m. it started to sprinkle and it lasted for 20 minutes. There were a few blasts of strong wind. I had my rain gear on. Just after I crossed the parkway for the last time the rain stopped. 
Around 4:45 I came to a stream. Sometimes a stream and rain on the trees sounds similar. I hoped the noise I was hearing was the stream. But as I got beyond the stream the noise increased, rain was coming. I had taken off the rain gear and was now putting it back on. Then the rain stopped. 
After 5 I took the rain gear off as I was too hot. As the trail descended I could see the clouds to the west. It looked like more rain. 
The air seemed warmer as I descended. There still was a breeze but not as strong as up on the parkway. 
I went by the Wilson Creek Shelter after 6 p.m. Only one more mile to go. I hoped I get there before dark. I came to the creek and began looking for a place to camp. First place, too close to the trail. Second place had lots of bones on the ground. I came to one right at the stream crossing and dropped my pack. I went across the stream to look up the trail but that's all it did was go up and up. So, back to where I dropped my pack. 6:30 pm. 
Just as I begin setting up the tent it began raining. I got the tent up and rain fly on but it was wet inside. Threw all my gear in then got water. Then I got in the tent wet, wet but not soaked. I used my camp towel to wipe the water off the floor. Then I got into my sleeping bag and quickly got toasty since the air is kind of warm.

The moon in its warning gibbous phase was almost directly above me. Stars dotted the sky. The stream's song was louder than the song of the winds up on the ridge above as I packed up. 
I left camp at 6:12 a.m. immediately crossing Wilson Stream. After climbing hills twice and crossing streams twice the trail leveled off. About 6:30 I turned off the headlamp and walked within the moonlight. The quiet woods' only sounds were my feet, my trekking poles, a stream, and occasional train horns. 
Daylight arrived almost unnoticed. One moment I'm in the moonlight and the next in the morning twilight, then daylight. 
I thought today's nine miles would be mostly downhill but I was severely mistaken. I didn't look at the elevation profile nor did I pay attention to the guidebook. Before I'd go downhill I'd have to climb a thousand feet up to Fullhardt Knob. It was five miles to that point. 
Going up the ridge the sun first hit me at 8 a.m. Near the top the winds I heard earlier this morning hit me. On top the wind was strong and cold. 
At the side trail to Fullhardt Knob Shelter the trail finally began descending. I could enjoy the hike better once out of the wind. 
In a few miles the trail dropped to pasture land, climbed over a mowed knoll steeply, crossed Norfolk Southern Railroad, then came to US 11. It was 11:10 a.m. 
I turned left and followed the four lane bermless highway into Troutville, often moving off the road for oncoming traffic. 
I thought I was going into Daleville but I found this side of I-81 is considered Troutville. All my receipts for the day will say Troutville. 
I went to Hardee's first of all. Then I went to the Dollar General Market, which is a larger store than the normal Dollar General and has fresh vegetables. Before I went in I called Motel 6 for a room. After reserving a room I asked when is check in time. She asked when do I want to check in. I said I'm right across the street. She said I could check in now. It was only 12:30, usually check in is 2 p.m. I was very pleased. 
Instead of going into Dollar General Market I went across busy US 220 to Motel 6 first. I wanted to get cleaned up and leave my backpack there. Incidentally, I live along US 220, just a few hundred miles north. 
After showering I went back to Dollar General Market to get five days worth of food. That will get me to Pearisburg, Virginia. Then back to the motel. I did laundry, organized my food and hung my gear to dry. 
Around 5 p.m. I went back to Dollar General Market for milk and to pick up a meat lovers pizza I earlier ordered at Italian Bella Pizza. Then back to the motel to relax for the evening. I ate my pizza, repaired my backpack, replaced any plastic bags I've been using, and soaked in the tub. A busy town day. 
Tomorrow is to be a beautiful sunny day with temperature around 65 degrees. Since it is to be a beautiful day I'm going to continue hiking and not take a zero day. A zero day was scheduled in Pearisburg so I'll wait until then. I expect to reach Pearisburg next Sunday and zero Monday. 
I break Virginia up into five sections to avoid the legendary ""Virginia Blues."" Virginia is the longest state on the AT and sometimes seems forever psychologically. The first two are complete: the Shenandoahs and the Blue Ridge Mountains. The third section is next: Daleville to Pearisburg. Then Pearisburg to Atkins followed by Atkins to south of Damascus at the Virginia/Tennessee border. So, I have 264.3 miles in Virginia.","Wilson Creek

I saw Dodge's store across from McDonald's so I went there instead. I needed Heet for fuel but they didn't have any. I got a coffee then went back to the motel. I had pizza for breakfast eating as I packed. 
I left the motel about 8:30 heading back to US 11. Just up the street was a Circle K gas station and they had Heet. I got a bottle and a small coffee. 
Trucks were everywhere. There were truck stops and plenty of restaurants around making this a great place for truckers. After getting across a busy intersection and a traffic circle I headed back to the trail on US 11. 
The highway went along a stream and had little room to walk off the payment if traffic came by. Several times I just had to find a place and wait until the traffic passed. On the trail at 9:23. 
The trail shortly passed under I-81 then paralleled the noisy interstate for a mile and a half. I crossed busy US 220 then a long easy walk in the woods. A girl, Wei Wei, was waiting for her hiker friend. They just finished four days of hiking. She gave me a Clif bar, a granola bar, dried grapes and a pack of instant coffee. I thanked her and we did the hiker handshake which is just fist against fist. This is for sanitary reasons. You never know where a hiker's hand has been. 
The trail climbed up Tinker Ridge. At the top was a great view back to the area where I stayed. Several huge towers stood above the trail holding high tension power lines. 
The day was sunny and beautiful. Haven't had this warm of a day since Maryland. A gentle breeze kept me comfortable. 
The trail followed along the ridge for the rest of the day. I could see way ahead to McAfee Knob where I hope to reach today. Great views below of the Carvin's Cove Reservoir. 
In the afternoon I started to sweat. The warmth and the five days of food in my pack were the culprits. 
I caught up to a hiker, Schooner. He is hiking from Front Royal, VA to Damascus, VA. We'd hike close together all the way to McAfee Knob. 
At Campbell Shelter I saw a bunch of kids and some men. I was going just beyond the shelter to Pig Farm Campsite, apparently an old pig farm. Schooner was going to the shelter, I thought, but seeing the kids he must have changed his mind. He stopped at the campsite, too. It was 5:20 pm. 
I went down the hill for water at a piped spring. The water came out slow. It took five minutes to fill a liter container. 
One of the guys from the shelter and two boys came down for water and we all talked. Schooner came down just after them. 
Moose was one of the leaders with the boys. They are from Florida and they take kids outdoors. Moose was maybe 20 years old. He hiked the AT at age 16 from Georgia to Connecticut then completed the trail the next year at age 17. That is amazing. 
When they knew I was a thru hiker the two boys had lots of questions. Wild Bill and Cub were their names, both probably less than 10 years old. I will see all of the group at sunrise on McAfee Knob in the morning.
The air turned cold. I headed back up the hill with Schooner behind me. He saw and pointed out two deer at the edge of a power line right-of-way. Both were bucks and displayed decent antlers. 
At the campsite there was a breeze so I camped across the trail down a little slope out of the wind. At 3,000' it will be cold up here. Let's see who gets up for sunrise.","Troutville, VA

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605024,"It was warm when I woke up. There was a slight breeze. The moon and stars were bright in the morning sky. 
I could see Schooner's headlamp across the trail. Down below at the shelter I could see headlamps. Looks like everyone is awake. 
At 6:50 I headed up to the top of McAfee Knob, a steep .6 of a mile climb. At the top I came to a vista looking east. The mountains to the east already had an orange glow. I dropped my pack and went on a bit. The famous cliff overhang was up the trail but when I got there I concluded the sunrise may not be fully viewed from that point. I headed back to the first vista. 
Schooner came in and then Moose and a group of the boys. In this group was Cub and Wild Bill whom I met last night. Wild Bill asked me while peering over his round spectacles ""Mr. Lake, will you help me take off the backpack?"" I lifted the pack which was heavier than mine. Too heavy for a nine or ten year old. 
Schooner snapped photos of the group with the group's cameras. I told Moose the famous overhang was above but I didn't think sunrise would be as good there as here. He decided to take the boys up there. 
Wild Bill asked me ""Mr. Lake, will you help me put my backpack on?"" With Moose's assistance I lifted the pack up so little Wild Bill could get his arms through the straps. Then the group headed on over to the overhang. 
A few minutes later another leader of the group came by with several boys. He asked where the rest of the group was so Schooner and I directed them to go on a bit. 
The sunrise was beautiful. The Blue Ridge Mountains were highlighted by the orange sky. Then the big orange ball crested over the ridges. Magnificent sunrise! 
I headed out following the trail downhill for a few miles. I arrived at the first road crossing at 10:15. It was six miles from there to VA 624 which has a store nearby. I decided to challenge myself. If I could get to that road before 1 p.m. I can go to the store. 
The trail followed a ridge for nearly two hours. The ridge was like a saw, frequent ups and downs. Then a drop through some old pastures, across a road and more pastures. 
The trail went up a stream and on the other side was an intact old rusted water wheel made of steel or iron. The building that once covered the water wheel was pretty much reduced to rubble. 
The trail continued up the stream and then up and over a ridge dropping to VA 624. It was 12:40. I won! Off to the store! 
The store was down the hill and a short distance on another road. As I walked across the parking lot I saw three burly guys sitting at an outside table observing my approach. I figured they didn't like a stranger nor a hiker. 
At the store I dropped my pack. One of them asked bluntly and with a southern drawl ""Where ya goin'?"" I told him Georgia. Another asked ""Where'd ya start?""  I told him Maine. Then they asked lots of questions and were quite friendly. When the conversation was over one said ""Our hats are off to ya."" Another said ""God bless ya!"" I thanked them and went in the store. 
I got two hot dogs, Uncle Ray's BBQ potato chips and a large Dr. Pepper. As I returned outside the burly guys were in a compact car backing up. They all waved out the open windows. I thought those burly guys in that little car was not cool. 
While eating, a hunter asked if I saw any bear. He said he saw a big one up the AT. He asked if I saw any snakes. He said the rattlers are out and dangerous this time of year. He said muzzleloader season starts Saturday and those guys will shoot at anything. I concluded this guy was just trying to scare me. I headed out and back to the trail. It was 1:18. 
The next section of trail was up to Dragon's Tooth, a row of giant teeth like rock outcrops. The trail was rocky and the last section was climbing up small cliffs similar to New Hampshire. It is the worst section of trail since New Hampshire. 
I was over the top at 3:15. I stopped at a vista where I could see back to McAfee Knob and the sawtooth-like ridge I hiked. Hundreds of things were floating in the air in front of me. They weren't birds but leaves being blown up the ridge behind me and then over and above me. 
The next section of trail was like Pennsylvania. It was walking on rocks again for a few miles. But then the trail finally descended off the ridge on glorious switchbacks down the mountainside. It leveled out in a large tall grove of beautiful Tulip Poplars. I've never seen so many together. 
The trail climbed then dropped to Trout Creek where I picked up two liters of water. Then I crossed Miller Cove Road where Schooner and Sprocket were setting up their tents. Sprocket is hiking from Daleville to Pearisburg. I went up the trail a short distance and began setting up my tent. 
An ATV came up the road and pulled in. The guy began talking to Schooner and Sprocket. My first thought was this guy was telling us we can't camp here. Then he walked up the slight hill towards me. 
I watched the grey haired man with a frizzy ponytail as he got close. He asked ""Do you want a Yuengling?"" I said ""Yes"" as he handed me a Yuengling Lager. We talked some and then headed down to where Schooner and Sprocket were. 
Doug said he lives nearby and helps hikers. He said he plans to open a hostel up the road. 
After finished the drink I thanked Doug and went back to finish setting up my camp as it was getting dark. A tough interesting day and I'm beat. 
As of today I have less than 700 miles to go. I can hear the creek nearby. I hope to sleep well.","Pig Farm Campsite
",Miller Cove Road,"Oct 31, Wed",18.10
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605037,"Around 5 a.m. I decided to pack up hoping to be on the trail at 6:30. I ended up on the trail at 6:08 which made me happy. I could see Sprocket's tent lit up by his headlamp but nothing at Schooner's. 
It was about a 1,600' climb up Brushy Mountain. The trail went up on excellent switchbacks. At 6:40 I turned off my headlamp because the waning crescent moon cast enough light for me to see. 
Near the top I took a break. The orange eastern horizon made incoming clouds orange and red. Another beautiful morning. 
The trail continued climbing, leveling off and following an old road. At 8:30 I came to World War 2's most decorated soldier's monument. Audie Murphy's plane crashed near this point in 1971. The small monument had many items people have left to honor the hero. A flagpole was behind the monument with the American flag. 
I continued on the grassy mountaintop road then descended on more good switchbacks. Schooner caught up to me and we hiked a bit together until VA 621. 
I left him go ahead since he was faster. It was a climb up to Niday Shelter. I needed to stop for water. An African American woman was there. Her name was Bear. She is out camping for three days and had a small fire going. Schooner came up from the side trail to the water source. I got water and came back. The three of us talked awhile then I headed out. 
The next big climb was up Sinking Creek Mountain. The trail was rough and rocky but not steep. It angled up the mountain for sometime before reaching the ridge. It was breezy all day but on the ridge it was very windy. 
The trail followed the ridge for miles. At first it was walking on and off slanted rock. But finally it was walking a flatter ridge.  
Schooner had passed me by but we met again at the side trail to Sarver Hollow Shelter. It was 3 p.m. He gave me a piece of mustard and honey cooked Spam. It was really good. 
I continued on the mountain ridge. One area was very flat for maybe a half a mile and about 100' wide. Huge piles of stone were all over this section in random places. Most of the piles had one section of the stones neatly stacked like a stone wall. It was a strange sight way on top this mountain. 
The trail finally dropped to Sinking Creek Valley. The trail crossed a road and there sat a 1963 black Ford Galaxy. I believe I've taken a picture of it every time I've passed through. 
The trail weaved a few miles through various old pastures. I remember cattle on the hills in previous times but not in these fields this time. The fences are down and the old stiles for hikers to pass through are set aside. But the hills and fields are still as beautiful as always. 
The wind was strong. Rain is coming through later tonight and may last through tomorrow. It was 5 p.m. crossing the valley and the sky looked threatening. I still had two miles to go. 
After leaving the farmland the trail climbed steadily through Mountain Laurel and Rhododendron. The trail later weaved through thick Rhododendron while following Laurel Creek. At 6:10 p.m. I came to the Laurel Creek Shelter. 
Two women from Florida were inside. Charm and her friend Screech Owl are out for about two weeks. Charm is prepping to do the AT in 2020. 
I went to get water and met Schooner coming into the shelter. We both got water and returned to the shelter. The four of us talked trail talk. It started getting dark so I went to set up my tent. Despite the coming rain I opted to tent. I fear I won't sleep well in the shelter with others since I always have difficulty sleeping. Plus I must re-position myself frequently due to my knee and leg and that may disturb everyone. 
Just as I put the last stake in the ground it began to rain. I got in and started to get organized. The wind was potent. I could hear items falling on my tent as well as a few branches nearby. The rain so far has been sparse. Hopefully in the morning I can pack up without getting too wet. 
If I am successful tomorrow with another 20+ mile day despite the rain, I may make it into Pearisburg Saturday instead of Sunday.","Miller Cove Road
",Laurel Creek Shelter,"Nov 01, Thu",21.30
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605142,"The wind died down before midnight and only a few sprinkles overnight. When I packed up this morning the rain fly was dry. It was warm enough out that I didn't have to wear a jacket. 
I saw someone packing up at the shelter's picnic table but couldn't see who it was. I was on the trail at 6:12. Right away a thousand foot climb in the dark. 
Near the top of Kelly Knob it was foggy. Using the headlamp in the fog made it look like I had glasses on and they were fogging up. But soon enough I was on top and it was daylight. 
I had to take my long sleeve shirt off coming up the hill but on top it was a little breezy and had to put it back on. Once out of the wind I was back to just the sleeveless. 
The trail was well graded for miles since the shelter, and travel was easy. After 10 a.m. the sun was out, despite the weather report that it was to rain today. I crossed VA 632 and was coming close to the next shelter. Then in the thick Rhododendrons I saw an archery hunter walking ahead of me. I was concerned he might get mad at me hiking while he was hunting but when he saw me he was very friendly. He let me go by. 
I went past the War Spur Shelter without stopping. Then a long well-graded 1,800' climb up the mountain. On top of the mountain the trail traveled through open woods for a few miles. A doe stood near, watching me as I went by. 
I arrived at Wind Rock just before 1 p.m. As I stood on the rocks I could see to the west rain was approaching. Just after I returned to where I placed my backpack it started to rain but didn't last. 
A short time later two men in their 70s came up the trail with backpacks and muzzleloaders. One guy told me they are too old to get up early enough to get here to hunt so they are going to camp out. Muzzleloader season starts tomorrow. 
Around 2:15 the rain started again. I put my rain gear on. I didn't use my rain pants nor my poncho. I thought if it got bad I'll get the rest of the rain gear out at the next shelter in 45 minutes. 
The rain got heavier about the same time the trail got rock bound. It was slow and slippery walking. 
I came to Bailey Gap Shelter about 3 p.m. I hung up my wet gear. Schooner is finishing this section near here and I was expecting him to go by me as he usually does. Since I didn't see him I left a nice note in the shelter's register. I left a note for Charm and Screech Owl too. 
Rain was heavy and loud on the steel roof. I got all my gear on and headed out. I wanted to get beyond the next shelter. My plan is to reach Pearisburg tomorrow afternoon so I needed to get as close as I could. 
The rain slowed in the two hours it took to get to the next shelter. At Pine Swamp Branch Shelter three guys were there. A fire was going in the shelter's inside fireplace. Two guys were going north and Smitty was going south, though I don't know if he is a thru hiker. It was 5:30. 
I continued up the Peters Mountain through the thick Rhododendrons. The trail was covered in multicolored leaves as well as the rocks in the stream nearby. The trail climbed on short well graded switchbacks up the mountain. 
As it began to get dark the climb eased off. I waited as long as I could to use the headlamp. It was foggy and a light mist was falling. A breeze chilled my gloveless hands. 
I finally had to turn on my headlamp and again it looked as if I was wearing foggy glasses. 
At 7:11 I came to my destination at the junction of the Appalachian and Allegheny Trails. It seemed hard looking in the fog and mist and dark for a flat place to camp. I finally started putting up my tent. I quickly got in and took my boots off. My socks were steamy. I pulled out my stove and began to warm some water as well as heat the tent. It was 7:35. 
I made mashed potatoes. I'm now keeping a bag of instant mashed potatoes handy in case of a cold day or being short on food. 
Water dropping from the trees and a wind are the only noise I hear. Tomorrow a town day and Sunday a zero day. Something to look forward to on this raw wet evening.","Laurel Creek Shelter

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605153,"Awake at 3 a/m. I thought about packing up and leaving by 4 a.m. but was concerned about traveling for hours with my headlamp. The brightness was weakening due to excessive use. I wish I had bought new batteries in Troutville. 
At 3:45 I decided to get up and leave by 4 a.m. After sliding into my clothes while in my sleeping bag I briefly closed my eyes. When I opened my eyes my tent was lit up! Aliens? My headlamp accidentally went on? Then I realized someone was at the trail junction possibly reading the signs and/or saw my tent and briefly directed his light my way. I determined it probably was Smitty who I met at the last shelter. Yesterday I heard him mention he was getting up early to go to Pearisburg also. 
I could hear the wind and droplets from the trees hit my tent. I made coffee and heated my tent with the stove. All I had dry were my coat and vest. Everything else was damp. I did have dry socks but they were only dry until I placed my feet into my wet boots. 
On the trail at 5:01. Goal is to get into Pearisburg around 2-3 p.m. 
As soon as I began hiking I was a bit concerned because it was foggy, misty, and windy. Like last night, using a headlamp in the fog was like wearing fogged up glasses. I could see less than eight feet ahead of me. 
My concern was what if the headlamp dies? I guess nothing serious. I'd just have to wait until daylight to continue. Another concern was what if I got off the trail and unable to find my way back? Again, I'd just have to wait until daylight. 
But the hike went well. I could see the indented treadway in the soil when not on rocks or covered with leaves. If it felt soft under my feet I knew I was off the trail and just backtracked. Sometimes I needed to search for one of the white blazes to know for sure I was on the AT. The many times I did miss the trail were quickly corrected by turning around and walking a few feet. It was windy and even snowed briefly. For the most part the foggy night hike was efficient and successful. I was relieved when daylight finally arrived. 
The day was foggy while on the mountain ridge. Twice, separately, two does jumped across the trail in front of me reminding me it was muzzleloader season. I had my orange hat and an orange vest on. 
Before Rice Field Shelter in an open saddle the wind was blowing strong. White ghost like fog figures blew across the trail in front of me. Then I noticed it wasn't just fog but it was blowing snow flurries. 
At the side trail to the shelter all I could see is fog. The shelter usually was in view but today it was hidden by the weather's white veil. 
The trail began descending. From the shelter to the New River it would drop 1,800' with a few ups and downs. As it descended but while still in the fog a group of six college age kids were going up. I wondered why?! Perhaps a day hike to the shelter. 
Some distance further down the mountain I was out of the fog. After crossing a road the trail climbed a few hundred feet before an easy well-built trail down to US 460. The trail went under an overpass and up multiple steps to the US 460 bridge over the New River. The Celanese chemical plant was right by the bridge. The air smelled like glue. While crossing the bridge the air smelled like raw eggs. 
I arrived at the street into Pearisburg about 1:45. I was pleased with the time. My wet feet were hurting. The corn had been agitated from the multiple rock walks the last few days and I felt a soreness from wet socks or wet shoe parts rubbing on my heel. Walking the old four lane highway up over a hill I was in the sun. The welcomed warmth soon caused me to sweat but I didn't mind it today. 
I stopped at Hardee's for a sandwich and a cup of coffee to go. Then I proceeded to the first motel, the Plaza. But the small motel was full. So, I went two buildings over to the Holiday Motor Lodge and was successful in securing a room for two nights. It was about 2:30. (I remember yesterday about this time as I was walking in the rain and thinking in 24 hours I'll be warm, dry, clean and full). 
After showering I went across the road to Food Lion for munchies. I also bought milk, Boost and a two liter bottle of RC Cola. 
For the evening I relaxed, ate, hung gear up to dry, took two baths, called with Heartrock and Mourning Dove (Sally). 
Tomorrow a zero day. I need to do laundry and buy food and fuel. But basically just rest. It's good to be warm, dry, clean and somewhat full. A thru hiker can be full but still be hungry.","AT and Allegheny Trail junction

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605163,"Today was a beautiful sunny day. I walked to Cloverdew Market for coffee just after sunrise. On the way back frost or ice was melting off the power lines and dripping onto the sidewalk. It was breezy and chilly. 
Nothing much to report today. I went to a laundromat, Dollar General, and Food Lion. Later I went to Tractor Supply for Heet that I use for fuel. 
Heartrock via phone helped me get an online permit for the Smoky Mountains. The permit was $20. It used to be free. Heartrock will mail it with the rest of the trail data book and other items to the Damascus, Virginia post office. I expect to arrive there around November 14th. I expect to reach the Great Smoky Mountains around Thanksgiving weekend. 
The conclusion of this hike I estimate to be around December 12th. That is at 16.7 mile days and I have been exceeding that amount though I don't want to do 20 mile days any more. Yes, I know I probably will. 
Since the hiking was unexpectedly slow in Maine and New Hampshire and due to being off trail after contracting Giardia I will end the hike at Springer Mountain in Georgia. I initially left open the possibility of going all the way to Flagg Mountain in Alabama via the Pinhoti Trail but that is no longer a desired option. 
This hike is the conclusion of 10 years of unexpected adventures, hence the trail journals web address ending in ""the final journey."" 
When I lost my job in December 2007 I was offered a transfer to downtown Jacksonville, Florida. I decided that wasn't for me and turned down the offer. I decided to hike the Appalachian Trail instead. After I hiked the trail in 1998, I had a desire to hike it one more time someday and in 2008 I did. That was all I wanted to do. Never in my wildest dreams would I expect to go on to hike all the places I have in the last 10 years. An amazing ten years. 
All seasons have an ending and this wonderful 10 years of my hiking season is ending. There have been great times and there have been near death times. Great joys and a few disappointment. But still 10 super blessed years. 
So, I suspect for the remainder of this trip there will be some emotions spilling out even though I normally don't do that. I hope to share some good moments from the past. 
Then, once I finish, I will return to Pennsylvania the same way I first got to Georgia: via Amtrak. The midnight train from Georgia...that could be a song. Ha ha, trying to make myself laugh but the ending is going to be tough as it is now just thinking about it. 
No words can express the gratitude to all who supported me the last decade. ""Thank you"" is so inadequate. Enough for now. We still have 636 miles to go.","Pearisburg, VA

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605172,"After I went to Cloverdew Market for coffee and returned to the motel I noticed the weather changing. I first thought it was a good morning but drizzle started. It had rained overnight but I thought the storm system was gone.  
At 9 a.m. I went to the post office. Heartrock had sent me a box. When I opened it at the motel it was full of goodies. I packed it up with the rest of my food. 
I walked down the old four lane highway and then a side road back to the trail. I was on the trail at 10:05. The drizzle had stopped and I was hot so I took my rain jacket and hat off. 
The trail climbed for several miles moderately up the mountain. Vistas were pointless because of the fog that persisted all day. 
Once on top, hiking was pretty easy. Sometimes the trail went through Rhododendron tunnels. While taking a picture of the tunnels a thru hiker came by. He was G-Man. Then a section hiker named Landslide came by and another thru hiker named Smiles. All three were hiking together. They continued and disappeared through the Rhododendron tunnel. 
At 3:45 I saw a hunter and we talked a bit. While talking another thru hiker came by. He was Trash-a-lope. He was continuing to Woods Hole hostel. 
I arrived at the Doc's Knob Shelter about 4 p.m. I intended to go on a few more miles. A section hiker from Ohio named Hippie was trying to get a fire going. At the picnic table G-Man, Smiles and Landslide were eating. I sat down and we all talked. We had a great discussion about each other's adventures. We traded food items. I shared some of the food Heartrock sent. Hippie didn't get the fire going so he joined us. We had a good hiker time. 
At 5 p.m. G-Man, Smiles and Landslide decided to go on to Woods Hole hostel. Since it soon will be dark and due to the possibility of severe weather tonight and tomorrow I decided to stay at the shelter. Hippie already had his items in the shelter. 
I said good bye to the group going to Woods Hole and we all hoped to see each other in the next few days. 
I put my tent up in the shelter which helps me stay warmer. Then Hippie and I talked for an hour on the deck as we watched the stars. He hurt his knee and will go to Woods Hole tomorrow. He hoped to get to Georgia but not so sure now.

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605193,"Around 4 a.m. I woke up and looked out at the wooden deck. I could see it was wet but it was not currently raining. I decided to pack up keeping the severe weather alert in mind. 
Hippie was breathing slow so I assumed he was asleep. I carefully packed up my gear out on the deck. At 5:01 I was on the trail. 
Severe weather was predicted but all I had to deal with is fog at first. I was able to shut the headlamp off around 6:20. 
Rain started but was lite. It was breezy but it was warm out. Then the rain stopped. 
On 3,870' Sugar Run Mountain I had a beautiful view eastward. But while observing the mountains and farmlands it all disappeared in a cloud as rain started once again. 
Before I left I checked the weather report and it still warned of heavy downpours. Later it was to get windier. 
I continued in the rain. The trail began dropping into the Dismal Creek watershed. For the most part I followed old roads and the walking was great. 
Rain stopped around 10 a.m. As I dropped in elevation it indeed was warmer. The sun even came out. 
For the next five or six miles the trail traveled in and out of vast Rhododendron groves. Frequent small steams flowed into Dismal Creek. There were many bridges to cross. This was a beautiful area. 
Sometimes I'd be under tall pines and sometimes walking through Rhododendron tunnels. I loved it. 
It became warm and I was sweating. I was making good time. I missed the side trail to Dismal Falls. I saw a trail but my memory dismissed it. I remembered it very differently and I was wrong. 
The AT climbed away from Dismal Creek then dropped to VA 606, Wilderness Road. After crossing the road a tall long suspension bridge crossed over Kimberling Creek. This was my destination but there was no where to camp so I continued. 
The trail climbed then did a wide u-turn into some fields as it headed up Brushy Mountain. About .6 from the suspension bridge I saw a wide flat area with a few trees to camp at. It was 4:20. 
The sun was still shining on me but not for much longer. I walked down into a ravine and was successful in finding water. 
Back at the camp the sun went behind the trees. There was just a gentle breeze. I placed my tent towards the back of flat area in case G-Man, Smiles, Landslide and Trash-a-lope would come in. I expected them to pass me somewhere today but did not see them. They may have stayed for breakfast at Woods Hole hostel and got a late start. 
I saw three hikers going north but no other humans. The only wildlife I saw were several deer.

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605201,"The inside of my rain fly was dripping when I woke. I think it was the dew. When I got out of my tent I shined the headlamp towards the trail to see if anyone came in and camped overnight. Two pairs of eyes reflected the light. Right away I knew they were deer so I did my cougar hiss and they ran. 
On the trail right at 6 a.m. The trail climbed through some pines then followed old roads. When daylight arrived I could see the excellent construction I was following. The whole day was on well constructed trails and on old roads. It was the best hiking day. The weather was beautiful and the sun sent its warmth. 
At 9:18 I stopped at Jenny Knob Shelter. I used my bear rope to make a clothesline then hung my tent, rain fly, and ground cloth up to dry. I made hot chocolate that Heartrock had sent me. I packed up and was back on the trail at 9:58. All day the sound of my feet crunching the leaves was basically the only sound. 
Around 11:30 I crossed VA 611. At that point I now have less than 600 miles to go. A while later I saw two guys going Nobo. They would be the only hikers I'd see all day. 
The trail was remarkable. Even on the ridges it was good hiking. Sometimes the trail followed old roads for miles right up on the ridge. 
The trail dropped to Kimberling Creek, the same creek I crossed on the suspension bridge yesterday, but at this point it was just a small stream. I got two liters of water then continued. 
The trail followed Kimberling Road crossing over I-77. It then followed US 52 before quickly turning onto Wyrick Road. 
As I ascended the one lane dirt road a black SUV came down. Beside it was a running barking dog that stopped and began barking at me. As the SUV passed I saw a wave but they were holding a baby up against the driver's window which was weird. Perhaps it was so the baby could watch the running dog. 
The dog kept barking at me as I protected myself with my trekking poles. Then I had enough. I did my cougar hiss as I charged the dog and it took off running. 
As I began going up the hill the SUV stopped at the bottom of the road. Then a big fat black lab came running down the road with its tongue flapping all over as if he heard the dinner bell. He looked happy but barked at me as he passed. He went on to the SUV. I think they let the dogs out on the forestry road to give them a run. 
I continued and found where the trail turned off the road. It was 4:52 p.m. I intended to camp immediately but a problem erupted. The trail was on the side of a mountain. I figured it would soon level out but it didn't. It merged with an old road and was barely descending. 
As darkness threatened the old road began to climb. I could camp on the road but I feared if I heard a hiker or a critter coming up the trail in the dark crunching the leaves I'd pee myself in my sleeping bag. There were no flat areas. I kept going only stopping to put my headlamp on. 
Just before 6 p.m. I saw a wide curve and a vista. It was wide enough I felt safe off the trail. Since it was dark I only could see a few lights and the mountain ridges. I bet it's beautiful in the daylight. 
A beautiful sunny easy day of hiking. Right now sprinkles are hitting the tent. Not supposed to rain tonight but tomorrow night and Friday rain will arrive. Saturday a high of 39 and low of 19. Not sure what plans will take shape.

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605250,"Last night I went to sleep around 9. About 10 I was awakened by light and voices. Fortunately I was not startled and had no bladder issues. I heard someone say ""Someone's already here"" and another say ""It's Lake."" So, I responded with ""Hey!"" 
It was G-man, Smiles, and Landslide. They apologized for stopping so late. This was apparently a campsite mentioned in their guidebook. We had conversation though I never got out of my tent. They camped next to me on the wide corner. I warned them I will be getting up early. 
G-Man said he was going to ""cowboy it"" which means no tent. After we all settled in for sleep it started to sprinkle. I heard G-Man hastily set up his tent. 
I was up around 4 a.m. I heard light snoring so I packed up as quietly as I could. When ready I walked between two tents crunching leaves as I tried to sneak through. I was on the trail at 5:13 a.m. 
The trail continued on the hillside. When daylight did arrive the terrain leveled out. Then a graded drop down to Laurel Creek. 
After another climb and drop I crossed Hunting Camp Creek where I picked up water then continued a short distance to Jenkins Shelter. It was 9:15. 
While at the shelter I shaved, washed my hair, and made coffee. I was back on the trail at 10 a.m. 
I had intended to reach Chestnut Knob Shelter and stay there tonight. Rain was coming in and I didn't want to pack up in the rain especially at the elevations I'll be trekking through today and tomorrow. After Chestnut Knob I was going to hike in the rain tomorrow to Knot Maul Branch Shelter just 9.4 miles further. Then town the next day. But shortly after leaving Jenkins Shelter I met Nobo section hikers Firefly and Owl. The women were weather app specialists. 
One rechecked her app and told me no rain until tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. That changed my whole plan for tonight and tomorrow. I thanked them as I continued in deep logistical thought. 
The trail's condition deteriorated quickly. It was back to rocks and steep climbs. On the vast climb up to the ridge I passed Twisted Sister #2. When I got to the ridge I met Twisted Sister #1. A short time later #2 arrived and we talked. #1 is older and from Maine. #2 is from Nova Scotia. She hiked the International AT in Canada and is part of the IAT organization in Nova Scotia. She was real interested when I told her I hiked the IAT through Canada. She said my name did not ring a bell but she did know Sterling the other guy who hiked the IAT the same year I did. 
I continued on the rocky ridge line, sometimes passing unique rock formations. At VA 623 I was a bit disappointed G-Man, Smiles, and Landslide didn't catch me. G-Man was leaving the trail to go to Disney World and I wanted to wish him well. Disney World was part of a family vacation plan. 
I continued, eventually dropping into Walker Gap where there was a stream. I needed water for the steep climb to Chestnut Knob. 
Going up the knob was very steep. However I was surprised when I saw the shelter at the time sooner than expected. The shelter is a renovated fire warden's cabin. I arrived at 5 p.m. 
Chestnut Knob is at 4,409'. It overlooks Burke's Garden, a large beautiful crater shaped depression surrounded by ridges and filled with farms. The Vanderbilts attempted to purchase all the land at one point but were unsuccessful and eventually built their mansion instead near Asheville, North Carolina. 
Since it is not to rain until 10 a.m. tomorrow, I earlier decided to go on a few miles. I was hoping Smiles and Landslide would catch up because I was going to see if we could join forces and push on to Lick Creek. Getting to Lick Creek would not only put us into a good position to reach Groseclose tomorrow but it is over 2,000' lower which means warmer. But, with no signs of those guys I decided to push on myself. It is all downhill and I felt energized. 
It began to get dark as I passed through several mowed expansive fields. The wind was blowing the grasses about. To the east and south I could see bluish grey mountains in the twilight. The largest of then was due south and must be Mount Rogers, the higher mountain in Virginia. I think I saw a bat fly by as I was observing the fading views. A few deer bolted as I got too close. 
I went by a pond I was looking for. I remember swimming in it on a hot day in 1998. I remember camping there with Metro North and a red head guy in 2012. 
At 6 p.m., about the same time the trail veered from the field and into the woods, I turned the headlamp on. The trail remained in the woods for the rest of the drop to Lick Creek. It definitely was warmer as I descended. 
The trail descended for the next two hours. The leaves seemed damp and not so loud as I walked. Small oaks' red color seemed extra red as the headlamp shined on them. Trees' girth seemed exaggerated as the light highlighted their growth pattern. 
At 7:55 I reached the bridge across Lick Creek. It seemed warm but it was flurrying. Even a few flying insects were about. 
I quickly set up camp, drew two liters of water, then placed my trash bag on one of the piers of the bridge so not to draw any critters. 
As I checked today's mileage I was surprised I went 25 miles! I didn't consider the total when I decided to push on beyond Chestnut Knob. But as I slid into my sleeping bag the knee let me know we pushed farther than was allowed by the union and it would protest all night long. 
I could hear several Barred Owls nearby. The rushing water of the creek hopefully will help me sleep. A long darkness to darkness good day.","Near Bland, VA

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605284,"Before I turned the light out last night I checked the mileage for today. I thought I had 15 miles to town but actually had 18. 
I didn't sleep well last night due to the knee protest. I tossed and turned trying to position the knee in a comfortable position but had no success. The corn on my toe also has been acting up. 
During the early morning it rained and sometimes hard. I pulled gear away from the edges of the tent so not to push out the tent to touch the rain fly. If it touches, it gets wet. 
As the rain slowed before 4 a.m. I started to pack up. When I exited the tent the rain had stopped. I packed and retrieved the trash bag from the pier and was on the trail at about 4:45. 
It was foggy only in a few spots. I came around one corner in the fog and dark to see two reflecting eyes. Momentarily I felt that fear tingle my head but realized it was a deer as it fled. 
I dropped into Knot Maul Shelter just after 7. No one was around. I continued over Brushy Mountain. 
Just as I was passing dilapidated Tilson's Mill along the North Fork of the Holston River it began to rain. I struggled angrily trying to get my poncho over myself as well as my pack. It never seems to cooperate. 
After crossing the next hill I came to a view of the fields along Old Rich Valley Road. I stopped for a break sitting on a fallen Ash tree. I always enjoyed the section in view (photo above). Coming the other way off the mountain into the fields in 1998 my dog Sheba ran from the cows in the field. She had been chased before. In 2008 the cows there ran towards me then stopped. They were just curious. I got some good pictures there of the cows and I. 
As I packed up and headed down the trail in the light rain I was happy to walk the fields. I crossed over a stile by the road then walked beside the one on the opposite side indicating it is no longer in use and no cows. 
After crossing through the field I noticed the trail markers were yellow. However, at a treeline was a big white and green Appalachian National Scenic Trail sign. 
As I continued there were more yellow blazes. While going up Big Walker Mountain at a switchback I saw yellow blazes below me and white above me. I felt better. Then I saw a mixture, sometimes white blazes sometimes yellow. I wondered if the trail had been relocated. 
After crossing over the rainy, foggy and windy mountain I came to an intersection. A new white blazes trail came in on the right. I must have missed the other intersection. It was raining plus I cut a corner there. I missed it. But since I did the old AT it's good enough for me. Case closed. 
The rain stopped around 1 p.m. while on Little Brushy Mountain. The sun even came out briefly. I was glad to take some rain gear off. 
The trail continued to descend through woods and rhododendrons. Then I walked through pastures with cows grazing. They watched me as I walked through staring intensely. I wondered what they were thinking. Maybe ""hiker trash'', or ""watch, he's going to step in a pie, ha ha ha moo"" or ""there goes the neighborhood."" 
After crossing a road drizzle began. Finally, later than I estimated, passed through the I-81 interchange at Groseclose. At US 11 the trail turned right and followed the highway south going by an Exxon station and then a Sunoco truck stop. The trail then turned left into some fields. This was my destination for the day. It was 3:25 pm. Not much in Groseclose, just the two gas stations, a restaurant being renovated, the motel and a few houses. 
I continued over the Middle Fork of the Holston River and stopped at the Relax Inn. I stayed here in 2008. It is supposed to be in the 30's tomorrow and very windy so I got a room for two nights. After dropping my gear in my room I immediately went across the motel's covered bridge replica over the Holston and over to the Sunoco. I ordered a pepperoni and hamburger pizza plus purchased milk, soda, and Mike's lemonade. Back to the motel to relax, fix my foot corn, and rest the knee. It's good to be dry, warm, and well fed.","Lick Creek

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605303,"Today was simply a day to stay warm, rest my knee, mend my corn, resupply and do a little planning. I failed to mention yesterday while at the Sunoco truck stop I saw two hikers walk in. As they walked towards me I struggled to recall their names. When close I said I know them even though I never met them. Then I remembered, it was Brandy and Andy. I knew their names rhymed. I've been told about them by G-Man, Smiles and Landslide. Though cold and windy tomorrow, the young couple were continuing their hike today. 
Later this evening I saw Smiles at the motel. He is meeting relatives tomorrow. He said G-Man had gone to Disney World and Landslide zeroed back at Chestnut Knob Shelter. So, the group has gone different ways. 
That's all that transpired today. I have made transportation decisions for the end of the journey. I discovered the train ride home was more expensive than to fly. Then I discovered it was inexpensive to fly to Florida as well as Pennsylvania. 
The plan has been to finish the AT on 12/12. I decided to fly out of Atlanta, Georgia on 12/15 to see Heartrock in Fort Myers, Florida. Then on 12/19 I'll fly to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, about an hour from home. I need to get home to check on the house and get it warm and in running order. 
Sandra asked me via the guest book why I won't be hiking any more after 10 years. This is a good question as I didn't explain my decision well. 
I will never stop hiking, I hope. I think maybe go for a month but not several months. Long distance thru hiking takes a lot of energy, money and time. That's one reason. But the main reason is I have arthritis in the knee probably from an old running injury I failed to have taken care of at the time. My knee needs to be replaced. I'm told I'm too young and too active at this time. Hiking this year was not a wise decision but I felt this year might be my last chance. Plus this year is the 20th, 10th and 6th year anniversary of my first, second and third thru hikes. 
The knee can be extremely painful at times. At the halfway point I wasn't sure if I could even finish. The 11 days off in Florida in late September seemed to help. But frequently I wonder if I can go on. With just over a month in this journey I trust I will complete what I've started. But I think I must forfeit any further hiking dreams. After this hike I plan to write and perhaps revive old music skills. Whatever the Lord has in store for me. 
I so love the the adventure, the camaraderie, and the freedom of thru hiking. It pains me to know this season of hiking is soon coming to a chosen ending.

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605319,"It was 17 degrees out when I went to the Sunoco station for coffee and a breakfast sandwich. All vegetation and vehicles were frost covered. 
Back at the motel I took a shower and finished packing. I left the motel and was on the trail at 8:50. It had warmed up to 20 degrees. 
The trail climbed for six miles to the top of 4,093' Glade Mountain. On the way it traveled through farm fields and new growth forests the first three miles. It passed the Settlers Museum and the 1894 Lindamood Schoolhouse. The second three miles it followed a stream through thick Rhododendrons going by Chatfield Shelter. The trail grade eased and about 12:30 I was at the top of Glade Mountain. 
At that elevation there were few leaves remaining so there was plenty of views in all directions. I saw one Nobo backpacker, the only person on the trail all day. 
The trail dropped a little in elevation going over Locust and Brushy Mountains. It seems I hiked several Brushy Mountains while west of I-81 so I am not sure if this is part of those mountains or not. 
Mount Rogers National Recreation Area HQ was closed on weekends. Even the water was turned off. I continued on an old road for several miles. Very easy and beautiful hiking. 
The trail left the road then followed ridges the rest of the day. I wanted to get to Pugh Mountain Road. That will put me in a good position to reach Hurricane Mountain Shelter around noon tomorrow. Rain is coming in and it is to be heavy tomorrow evening. 
The ridges were somewhat easy to traverse. Around 5 p.m. I began looking for a spot to camp. I didn't want to go into the dark tonight. 
I could see the sun getting lower and lower. I almost stopped at one flat area until I saw some trash near by. 
I kept telling myself ""one more hill."" After a few more hills along the ridge I saw it drop down. I decided I'll stop there because the sun had already set. As I came down the slight hill there was Pugh Mountain Road. I was very happy. Just beyond the road I saw a campsite and got my tent up and gear inside quickly. 
Looks like 15.1 to Hurricane Mountain Shelter or 20 to Old Orchard. I plan to leave real early and get at least to the first one before the rain begins tomorrow.","Groseclose, VA

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605324,"Last night just before I got in my tent I saw the waxing crescent moon in the west. A beautiful sight. 
This morning I was awake at 2:40. I decided to get up because I was planning on leaving at 4 a.m. anyway. It didn't seem too cold and I was dressed without using the warmth of the stove. After coffee I packed up and got on the trail at 3:40. 
My strategy for today was to get to at least Hurricane Mountain Shelter before or shortly after the rain starts. I checked three weather sites and each had different start time. I saw 9, 11, and 1. 
The morning seemed warmer than last night though I wondered if I'd see rain or snow. In some places I could see my breath. Besides my crunching the leaves the only other sound was frequent train horns. 
After daylight arrived, the trail simply followed along the mountainsides, climbing on graded trails. On one mountain I noticed a multitude of yellow throughout the woods. It was Witch Hazel in bloom. The high point for the day was appropriately named High Point at 4,040'. 
After I crossed Comers Creek below some waterfalls the rain began. It was 11 a.m. I put on all rain gear including the poncho, which cooperated with me for a change. 
The trail stayed contoured as it weaved in and out of hollows. Then I saw a sign 3/4 mile to the shelter. The trail followed a steep wide old road up the mountain. The higher the colder, I thought. I found the side trail to the shelter and followed it. I arrived at the shelter at 12:40. 
The shelter was very well built. It even had a porch added on covering the picnic table. Looking down through the woods I only saw fog. The rain was hitting the roof gently. 
After walking back and across the AT for water I returned to the shelter. I decided to stay and not go on in the cold rain. 
I was getting cold so I got the tent up quick. Shortly I was in my sleeping bag and making coffee. 
Rain is to be heavy overnight and may linger into the morning. Tomorrow I'll go 16 miles to Thomas Knob Shelter at 5,400'. Brrrrrrr.

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605342,"Rain all night. When I got up after sunrise I was surprised it seemed warmer out. I called Heartrock to check the radar and she said I'd be in the rain for awhile. 
I decided I'd leave no later than 9 a.m. even if it's raining. At 8:30 the rain stopped and I was on the trail at 8:48. 
The trail was great all morning. While not much for viewing due to the fog, the forest was beautiful. Two bedded down deer right next to the trail jumped up and startled me as I startled them. 
Today I planned to do 5, 6, and 5 mile segments, approximately. That is the distance between shelters. 
I arrived at Old Orchard Shelter at 11:48 a.m. This is where I thought I might have gotten to yesterday pending the rain. I'm glad I did not come here yesterday. Hurricane Mountain Shelter was well built. This shelter was old and made of logs. Huge gaps were between the logs possibly allowing wind and rain through. 
I camped in the fields in front of the shelter 20 years ago. Now those fields are a new growth forest. 
The trail climbed up over Stone Mountain. It was foggy and windy though temperatures were not bad. Wide open fields in all directions. Normally the views of the terrain would cause a person to believe they were in the Rocky Mountains but today the fog limited how far one could see. 
Earlier I saw horse tracks on the AT and I thought how horses are not allowed on the trail. Then I realized the tracks were from the wild ponies that roam the highlands. Not too far after that I saw seven wild carefree ponies grazing and paying no attention to me. 
After crossing a few bridges in the Wilson Creek drainage area I arrived at Wise Shelter at 3 p.m. 
The trail left Mount Rogers NRA and entered Grayson Highlands State Park. I saw more ponies in the foggy grasslands. 
In the wind I was chilled and out of the wind I was warm. The trail climbed onward towards Mount Rogers. I left Grayson Highlands State Park and reentered Mount Rogers NRA. The trail climbed through fields and rock outcrops. 
At Wilburn Ridge Trail as it was getting dark, briefly I did not know which way to go due to various human trails and multiple pony trails. Then my headlamp picked up a white blaze and I veered in that direction. 
The trail went through deep dark Rhododendron thickets, foggy and spooky. This area had been closed in August due to bears behaving badly and I was hoping not to encounter any. There have been bear warning signs posted frequently along the trail and at shelters. 
In the dark and fog I followed the trail while being blasted with the winds. Now out of the Rhododendrons I was in the open except for a few patches of trees. I could smell balsam in the air reminding me of the New England mountains. I also smelled smoke reassuring me I did not pass the shelter in the dark. 
At 6:20 p.m. I saw two slanted alien eyes looking towards me. They were the reflectors on someone's pack hanging in front of the shelter. Seven people were there camping for three days. They made room for me on the first floor. I dropped my gear out front and headed for the water source. 
I went down the hill in the dark and fog following a path. I found the piped spring and filled one liter. On the way back up my headlamp stopped working. I thought I might not get back up to the shelter easily but after fiddling with the batteries the light worked. 
I got into the shelter and found my place. Four people upstairs and, with me, four people downstairs along with an Irish Wolfhound. 
The doorway was now blocked by a big tarp to keep the wind and cold out. However, the tarp was being thrown around violently by the wind. Also, one of the women on the first floor began snoring. No problem because I stuck my ear plugs in. I stuck them in so far I think they could touch each other. It was uncomfortable, but for the most part it blocked out the noise. 
At 10 p.m. I was awakened by a constant loud noise. I took out the ear plugs to hear the horrid snoring of a guy five feet from me. It sounded like a moose not only with the flu but a moose that snorted a running chainsaw. He would have gotten gold at the Snoring Olympics. 
After five minutes I concluded this was not going to work for me. I simply packed up and hit the trail into the cold windy  night. Despite all the bear warnings this group left dog food open outside and a pan of leftover mashed potatoes on the picnic table. 
No camping is allowed next to the shelter so I went a short distance and found a place with some wind protection in some woods. It was cold, very cold. 
I got the tent up quickly, got inside, and lit my stove to warm things up for a little bit until I got situated.","Hurricane Mountain Shelter

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605372,"At 5,400' I had no doubt it was to be cold in the morning and it was. The wind had subsided which I was grateful for. I pushed out my rain fly from the screen a bit and lit my stove. After two cups of coffee it was 70 degrees inside my tent, though briefly. As soon as the flame went out the cold invaded my space once again. 
On my third cup I got dressed fast and all gear ready. I was packed up and on the trail at 6:38 am. 
The trail was iced. In the distance, bands of white iced trees lined the mountains. I was glad that did not happen where I was camped. Now, thinking about it, my water bottles weren't frozen despite being outside my tent. 
I actually warmed up pretty quickly as I power walked. A glorious morning. 
At one intersection with multiple trails I concluded I should go straight. Out in a meadow I saw on a boulder a blue blaze not a white one so I had to backtrack. I'm glad I didn't go that far last night in the dark or I might have been on the wrong trail for who knows how long. 
The trail went below the summit of Mount Rogers (5,729'), the highest mountain in Virginia, by a few hundred feet. I continued through open highlands with awesome views. No fog today! 
Later the trail passed a few hundred feet below Whitetop Mountain (5,520') the second highest mountain in Virginia. After Whitetop I stopped in the openness to see if I could check the weather. I knew some rain was in the forecast for tomorrow but it significantly changed. Now there was a winter storm warning from 7 tonight until 1 p.m. tomorrow. Ice and up to 2"" of sleet was in the forecast. 
I was planning to stay at Lost Mountain Shelter tonight then venture into Damascus in the morning. This forecast changes everything. 
It was mostly downhill to the shelter. I pushed and arrived at 2 p.m. I then decided I can make Damascus by 7 pm tonight. I pushed the next two miles to the Virginia Creeper Train, a spectacular bike trail. 
Just before the Creeper trail I stopped to shave and wash my hair. It is a town day and I have got to not look like a hiker. I arrived at the Virginia Creeper Trail at 3 p.m. Just as I started I saw two Nobo hikers. Aside from the group at the Thomas Knob Snoring Shelter I've only seen one other hiker since Groseclose. 
The AT breaks off the Creeper trail, goes to the ridge, rides the ridge, drops back down and parallels the Creeper Trail, climbs back to the ridge, rides the ridge, then drops again to the Creeper Trail at Damascus. With a winter storm warning I decided to do the sane thing and stay on the Creeper Trail until Damascus. Its only three miles shorter but without the pointless ups and downs. 
The Creeper Trail of course is easy as it follows Whitetop Laurel Creek all the way. The white water through the Rhododendron-lined valley is simply beautiful. I think the Virginia Creeper Trail is the most beautiful bike trail I've ever ridden. I rode the trail twice previously. 
At 4:30 it started to rain. After dark it rained harder. I had all my rain gear on. My headlamp easily lit up the rain and returning fog though I could only see maybe 10'. 
My knee was threatening the whole adventure. Pushing hard on the flat surface was causing a lot of pain. At one point I thought I might not make it. I slid the Ace bandage on my brace down from my knee to my ankle. The knee felt so much better and I continued. 
Two runners went by heading in the opposite direction. When they returned they told me what bar to stop and eat at. I thanked them but my thought was just getting to town and out of the rain. 
I came into town at about 7:25. The highway makes a shape right into town and there was a Subway. I took off my poncho and pack to go in. I got a Coke, a steak and cheese sandwich and three chocolate chocolate chip cookies. 
Back out in the rain I tucked my poncho away and went in just my regular rain gear. I walked down the street into town dangling my white Subway bag and Coke. 
I was heading to The Place Hostel. On the way I knew Crazy Larry's was somewhere. I saw a sign that said ""Don't just walk in"" and a dog sitting there on a chair. (At the time I did not know it was Crazy Larry's). 
I could see by the passing vehicles' lights that it was raining hard. I turned left, went a few blocks, then left again to The Place. Unfortunately The Place was closed for the winter with a sign saying ""No tenting."" 
I returned the way I came going to the Hiker Inn. There was a sign ""No vacancies."" 
I went by the Appalachian Trail Town Inn but it looked expensive so I went to the Broken Fiddle Hostel. I went up the porch and I could see through the door it was packed (I later learned those staying there were seasonal workers in the area to harvest Christmas trees). 
I went back to the Appalachian Trail Town Inn. I knocked on the door but no answer. I picked up a business card but I had no cell phone reception there. I left my gear there and walked up the hill to Cowboys store. I got reception there. While standing in the rain the phone just rang and rang. I went back and got my gear. 
I thought I should have stayed at the shelter. I thought maybe head out of town to camp. One more hope. Perhaps I did go by Crazy Larry's. I went back to the house I passed earlier with the dog and the ""Don't just walk in"" sign. It was Crazy Larry's. I rang the doorbell and he welcomed me in. Sally, the dog, was a sweet friendly old dog. Time was about 8:30. 
While we talked I ate my sandwich and cookies. Then I got a shower. Crazy Larry did my laundry.

I finished eating my chocolate chocolate chip cookies. Outside it was raining hard. I checked myself on the weight scale and I lost four more pounds. Now at 149. This is down from I think 184. 
Around 10 a.m. in the rain I went to Mount Rogers Outfitters. I wanted something to keep my feet warm. I bought merino wool long johns instead. Then a three day resupply at Dollar General. I love Dollar General. 
Then to the post office. Heartrock had sent me a box with the remaining AT Trail Companion pages, the Great Smoky Mountains N.P. Permit, the bottom lengths of my convertible shorts, and my legal drugs and vitamins. The guy there told me they did not have it. I thought I'd check back later. 
On the way back to Larry's I stopped at Cowboys for two breakfast sandwiches and chocolate milk. After eating one sandwich and the milk I headed back to Larry's. 
I had no phone reception so I emailed Heartrock about the box. Using the tracking number she found that it was delivered then sent to some holding facility. It was 12:45. 
I checked my trail book and the post office closes 1-2 p.m. so I hustled over there in the rain. I showed Julie my email from Heartrock and gave her my ID. She came back with my box. On the label it has my last name then first name and under that my first name then last name. They filed it under my first name. I thanked her and let Heartrock know I received the box. 
In the afternoon Hash came in. He's a Sobo too. I haven't seen him since near the Massachusetts/Connecticut border. He actually hiked to Bland and got a ride here to meet his wife. The car he came in had slush and snow on it. 
For dinner Crazy Larry made us delicious pork chops and fried veggies. He was going to cook tuna steaks but I put a stop to that. I eat nothing that swims though, secretly, I thought I'd like to try tuna steaks someday...they'd have to be well done. 
Tomorrow I have to mail a box out before I leave so I'll get a late start. Tennessee is just four miles away. Also, I am under 500 miles until the finish. Actually at 470 miles as of last night. 
Hash has a cabin near the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. He says it won't be as bad traversing the mountain range as everyone has been saying. This reduced my concerns a bit. 
I need to do 17 mile days to finish on 12/12 and I've been exceeding that. Today's unexpected zero day upped the ante some but all should be well even with a few adverse weather days. The next seven days looks good weather-wise...at this time.

Around 8:30 Hash and I went to the post office. I had a box to mail to Heartrock and he had two boxes to forward to Hampton. On the way back we got egg sausage and cheese biscuit sandwiches at Cowboy's. After eating we headed back to Crazy Larry's. 
Crazy Larry was on the phone talking to Jeff at Mount Rogers Outfitter. He was asking if he had any Yak Tracks for me. They slide under shoes to help on snow and ice. It was kind of him to call for me. 
I packed up and thanked Crazy Larry. He is an interesting fellow with lots of good stories. I felt sad to leave. I said good bye to Hash and headed out. It was 10 a.m. 
At Mount Rogers Outfitters Jeff had the Yaks for me. He's a talker. He referred to himself as Jeffro. I thanked him and headed out. 
A wind advisory was in effect until I think noon. It was breezy but nothing terrible. I probably looked foolish to some people because I was wearing my shorts and jacket. It was to warm up eventually and I had high hopes the snow was going to melt soon. 
I missed a turn and continued on a dead end road. Snow stuck to the poles covering the blazes. I realized my mistake and headed back. A man came out of one of the houses and told me to go to the stop sign and turn left. I thanked him and followed his instructions. 
The trail immediately climbed the mountain on gentle switchbacks. A set of tracks were already on the trail and I could tell by the tread they were Merrells. 
A day hiker came down the trail. Then I saw a guy hunting with a muzzle loader. Then an unfriendly guy with a pack came by with a backpack and a plastic cage with a dead looking bird inside. That was weird. 
After 11 a.m. the sun came out and the snow began to melt. I was very optimistic. 
At 12:33 I crossed the border into Tennessee. I made it through Virginia without getting the Virginia blues. 
The trail continued to climb steadily. Up higher there was slightly more snow and it wasn't melting. The trees were covered in ice. Up on the ridge the wind was causing the trees to sway sending ice shrapnel all over. A piece of ice hit my upper arm and it felt as if someone punched me. 
The Merrells tracks kept going. I assumed it must be a hiker. At 4:15 I came to Abingdon Gap Shelter. The tracks stopped there. Inside was Steady. We met at a shelter a month ago in the dark. I spoke to her and her hiking friend back then but only saw a headlamp. I didn't stay there that night. 
Now I got to meet her in the daylight. Her hiking friend went home and will finish next year. 
I went the .2 down the hill for water and back. I debated whether to stay or not at the shelter but decided to continue. I wished Steady well and continued in the snow. Mine now are the only tracks. 
At 5:15 I came to one of the original shelters. It was the tiny McQueen's Knob Shelter. It is only to be used in an emergency. I had no plans of attempting to stay there but instead set up my tent nearby. 
I couldn't remember if you are to remove the snow or camp on top of the snow. I decided to sweep away the snow with my cold wet shoes. 
Just before I got into my tent I saw the moon to my east shining through a pink cloud. The whole sky was white and pink from the sunset. To the west I could see plenty of lights perhaps from Abingdon or Bristol. 
At the moment I can hear the cracking of ice on the trees as well as falling ice. An interesting sound of nature in the cold woods at night.","Crazy Larry's Hostel, Damascus, VA

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605420,"Ice kept falling all night but nothing damaged the tent. I got my coffee going and got warmed up. I dreaded putting on my cold wet shoes but did using plastic bags to try to keep my dry socks dry. 
On the trail at 5:11. What a beautiful sight. Stars filled the sky. A planet to the east shone brightly. To the west hundreds of lights of an unknown town. The snow reflected my headlamp, looking like thousands of blinking white Christmas lights as I walked along. 
At one point I looked at the ground and saw I was following a small bear's tracks. Later I followed bobcat tracks. My tracks were the only human tracks. 
At Double Springs Shelter I stopped for water. Just after I left a hiker came up the trail. When the sun came up all the ice and snow started melting again. I was hoping it all would melt today. 
Crossing the fields at the old Osborne Farm was warm. The trail was muddy though most of the snow was gone. At a gate two hunters came up the trail. A short time later an elderly couple walked up the stone path. 
All seemed to be going very well until the climb up High Point. For miles branches and treetops were on the ground from the recent ice storms. The trail at times was like walking through crushed ice of various sizes that had fallen off the trees. Travel was slow due to these obstacles. 
At Iron Mountain Shelter three men were just leaving. I've been following their tracks since the Osbourne Farm. It wasn't long before I passed two of them, a father and a son in his 20's. 
The lead guy was cruising thru hiker speed. When I finally caught him we talked. He is a weekend hiker and the other two are his friends having worked with the father. I continued while he waited for the others to catch up. 
The trail still was hard to walk almost all the way to Vandeventer Shelter. I got there about 5:15. A guy was in the shelter making coffee using melted snow. He could not locate the trail to the spring.
The three guys came in shortly behind me. We all were going to the next spring in 1.7 miles. I headed up the trail and quickly saw the blue blaze trail to the spring for the shelter. I went back and told the guy staying there, then continued. 
It was getting dark but what a beautiful night! The white moon to my left and the orange sunset a bit to my right. Glorious! 
I stopped where I thought the spring was that I was going to camp at but was wrong. The lead guy of the group of three came by and I followed him. He said he knew where it was. 
When the trail dipped down into Rhododendron thickets it was almost dark then the trail would come up and there was the moon and sunset again. This was repeated many times. I was enjoying this beautiful evening hike. 
The guy was using his headlamp but I wasn't. We talked as he searched for the spring. He said his tired friends will be mad that he continued so far after the shelter. 
Finally about 6:30 we found the spring. I was preparing to have a waterless night or continue 3+ miles further to a stream. I was happy to stop. 
I turned on my headlamp and found a place to tent. Shortly the other two guys came in using their headlamps. All three of them had hammocks to set up. 
A good day though discouraged at times in the afternoon. Then a fun evening adventure with a stranger looking for the spring in the dark. 
Tomorrow a blitz into Hampton, Tennessee for a resupply. After that the next town stop is Erwin, Tennessee, perhaps on Thanksgiving.","Old McQueen's Knob Shelter, TN

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605427,"Not too cold overnight. The only thing I was dreading was putting on the cold wet shoes. After three cups of coffee I used the remaining flame to heat the insides of my shoes then slid them on. Still damp but warm. 
I was on the trail at 5:25. One of the other guys was awake as I could see his red night vision lamp. 
The stars were out again and beautiful. No snow to reflect my headlamp. I could see what either was Watauga Lake or fog above the lake below me to my left. 
The trail descended steadily and as I near the bottom daylight arrived as well as the fog from the lake. At Wilbur Dam Road was a strange official sign. It said ""due to bear activity ... no picnicking, lingering, or camping allowed"" for the next four miles. It said the AT was open to hiking but ""...for your safety hike through this area and do not stop."" Well, if that doesn't make you nervous nothing will. And what's going to happen if I stop? Ambush? Robbery? BBQ? 
Well, I had to stop and I was on full scale alert. I needed to get clean up before I headed into town. Got to have that fluff in my hair and no BO. The bear can ""kiss my grits"" (remember that from TV?). 
Later I hit the road and headed into Hampton. I needed fuel so I stopped at Roadrunner Market but they had no Heet. Then I decided to go to Laurel Fork Diner for breakfast. I got an omelet with everything and it was so good. It came with a homemade biscuit. Everything was excellent. I originally was going to go to McDonald's for breakfast but was glad I stopped at the diner. The waitress told me two places that might have the fuel but I checked and neither did. Also McDonald's only had drive up service so I'm more glad I went to the diner. 
As I made a loop of the tiny unincorporated town I got a cold cut sub at Subway. Then I went to Dollar General for five days worth of food. I saw a fuel additive there and the young clerk said that is what I can use for fuel. He was familiar with hiker needs as this town is a regular stop, being less than two miles off the trail. 
I headed out on US 321 back to the trail. It was hot now. I walked in shorts and sleeveless shirt, still sweating. I followed the blue blaze trail up Laurel Fork Gorge back to the AT. A cool breeze coming down the gorge was refreshing. I was hoping I'd get back to the trail at 1 p.m. and I got there at 1:03. I was happy. In town I thought I would not make it. 
As I headed up the trail I met two Sobo thru hikers. One was Sweet but not the same Sweet I hiked with in Maine. The other I met a few times but forgot his name. He had hiked with Spencer who started the sane day as I did. 
They hiked on as I stopped at a bridge to eat half my sub. I sat on a rock eating and drinking a Coke. Trail life can be good. 
I headed up the beautiful gorge. The trail followed right along the creek through Rhododendron thickets. At one point the trail was narrow as it followed along a cliff right next to the water. Then after a slight climb there was Laurel Fork Falls. Many people were at the falls. I went down the steps for pictures then climbed back to the trail which climbed steeply on steps way up to an old railroad bed.  More people were coming down the trail to the falls. 
The old railroad made deep cuts in the mountainside that the trail followed. After crossing the creek the railroad continued out to a parking lot. Just before there I stopped and ate the rest of my sandwich. 
I crossed a road and climbed for several miles. On the way was a dilapidated old log building and old fencing. I climbed through more Rhododendron thickets up until the trail leveled off. At the junction with Coon Den Falls Trail I stopped for the day. It was only 4:15 but I was tired and carrying a heavy load. 
After setting up camp I ventured down the side trail to the falls. I went down in 2008 but didn't remember it. As the trail descended I saw the falls from a distance. Then I remembered the trail went way down and circled back to the base. I decided I did not want to do that today and headed back to my tent. 
A good day and a good town stop. My tummy thanks me.","Big Laurel Branch Wilderness
",Coon Den Falls Trail Junction,"Nov 18, Sun",17.70
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605434,"Woke up after 4 a.m. which is unusual. On the trail at 5:36. It didn't seem too cold so I wore shorts and a jacket over my shirts. It wasn't long until I took the jacket off. The climb to White Rock Mountain was 1,600' and I warmed up quickly. 
I stopped at Moreland Gap Shelter. Smoke was all that was left from last night's fire. Smiles and Scraps (finally got his name) were getting ready to leave. They asked a lot of questions when they saw the PCT and CDT patches on my pack. They headed out going 18 miles today. 
A section hiker there named Rat Pack offered his power pack to recharge my phone. I didn't need it recharged but took advantage of his offer. It did add 5% to the power of my phone. 
I then headed out hoping to reach US 19E. I knew the trail would be somewhat easy today. 
The trail weaved in and out of Rhododendron thickets all day. There were plenty of streams to cross and follow. Several waterfalls along the way also. The leaves were dry and I made a crunching noise as I walked through them. Perhaps that is why the only wildlife I saw all day was an owl who watched me pass by from about 25 feet. 
The trail followed Elk River for a short distance. It seemed hot out as I walked along the river in the full sun. I wore shorts and a sleeveless shirt. 
The only other hikers were three giddy young women in the morning and later a guy with two teenage girls. After the guy went by I thought he definitely looked like a Nobo thru hiker. After they were gone I thought perhaps it was Grey Beard, a guy I was supposed to say hello to, as requested by the Twin Classmates back in the Blue Ridge Mountains. I believe Grey Beard is hiking from Springer Mountain, Georgia to Virginia. 
After the river I climbed a hill then took a side trail to towering Jones Falls. It was beautiful. Then my camera case fell and went out of sight over a drop off. I moved some branches and climbed down holding onto a thick Rhododendron branch. As I got down a level I couldn't see the red case. Then I looked up and it was up where I held onto the Rhododendron branch. So, I climbed back up, pulling on the branch, and rescued the camera case. 
Back to the trail. I knew wasn't going to make it to US 19E but still a good day. I crossed Campbell Hollow Road and there in some pines was a giant camping area on a bed of pine needles. This was the spot. At 5 p.m. I stopped. 
Tomorrow has a chance of showers at last report. The trail goes over two balds and later Roan Mountain at 6,285'. It could be an interesting day. 
Back at Jones Falls I now am under 400 miles to go. Everything seems to be on schedule at this time.","Coon Den Falls Trail Junction
",Campbell Hollow Road,"Nov 19, Mon",19.40
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605469,"There were a few showers after I went to bed last night. I hoped they were the showers I knew were coming in today. Yesterday Pack Rat said rain today. I was a bit concerned because of going over Hump Mountain which is a bald and going over Roan Mountain at over 6,000'. 
I packed up and was on the trail at 4:38 a.m. I could hear the wind above me. All the way in the dark to US 19E there were flurries. 
Not too long after I crossed US 19E I was able to turn the headlamp off. The trail climbed on switchbacks for two hours. In some hollows I was hit with strong winds. 
Just before Doll Flats I put on my rain gear for extra warmth. I knew on top I would be hit head on by the wind. 
At Doll Flats I saw two tents. I think they were Sweet and Scraps. Just beyond the tents was a sign for North Carolina. It was 8:35. From Virginia to this point the trail was in Tennessee but from now on it follows the border of Tennessee and North Carolina. 
As I climbed above the treeline I was surprised there were no hard winds. It was breezy but nothing like I experienced coming up. I climbed in and out of fog. At 10:10 I was on top of Hump Mountain. A big buck with a big rack jumped across the trail in front of me then disappeared over the hill. 
The trail swung left as it descended into Bradley Gap. Now the winds were swift and hitting me from the right side. For 20 minutes I battled the winds trying to walk steady. My face was cold. 
On the other side of the gap the trail entered the woods and the winds eased. Then the trail went over Little Hump Mountain exposed again. A guy and a girl came the other way day hiking in shorts. They looked cold. They had two beautiful huskies. 
I went past the side trail to Overmountain Shelter, an old renovated barn. If it had been raining I would have stopped there. The barn was the backdrop for the movie Winter People. 
At 1:11 I reached Murray Shelter perched right on the cold windy ridge. I stopped for a break. After getting water from the spring, I made a much needed cup of coffee. I left at 1:44. 
Before Jane Bald I met a young couple on their first overnight camping trip. After Jane Bald I met three cold looking guys going camping. Then two young women going camping. I'm somewhat seasoned but I still cold. Can't believe everyone going camping tonight. 
At Carvers Gap the winds were blowing. Trees and weeds were all covered in white. I crossed the road and headed up Roan Mountain on switchbacks then an old carriage road. Temperature was dropping but I was out of the wind. I could smell the balsam. 
The trail finally began heading down after 5 p.m. Ice patches were frequent. 
Two guys and two girls came by. I asked where they were going. They were returning to Carvers Gap where they parked. They looked cold too. They asked me how far it was to the road because it was getting dark and they were worried. 
When they left one guy shook my hand. I showed him how thru hiked shake hands via the knuckles to knuckles. They liked that so the others did it too. 
I continued down and down. It was cold and I knew the night was to be cold. I just wanted a place out of the wind. 
At 5:50 p.m. I came to Ash Gap. I had to get water so I dropped the pack and put my headlamp on. It was a steep drop .1 down to the water. The water was spread out and thin. I wasn't sure how to get any in my bottle. Then I saw an eight inch long small plastic pipe apparently used to guide the water. I dug a ditch with my hand, put the pipe down and covered it with mud. After the water ran through it and after the water cleared up I got my liter of water. 
Back up to the tent. Trees and weeds sparkled as my headlamp hit the ice on them. I got the tent up and was in by 6:20. It is cold and breezy. Good training for the Smoky Mountains next week.","Campbell Hollow Road
",Ash Gap,"Nov 20, Tue",22
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605516,"It was COLD when I got up this morning. Don't know how I did it but I was on the trail at 4:40. A yellow moon was to my left as I descended for an hour and a half to Hughes Gap. Near the gap a hunter was coming up with his headlamp on and we talked for a few minutes. 
Almost all day the trail followed old roads or on well constructed trails. Hiking was superb. Basically three colors were seen until Unaka Mountain. The colors were brown leaves on the ground, grey trees, and a beautiful blue sky. 
I stopped at an old orchard high up on a mountain. The apple trees had clematis growing in them. The orchard was mowed and the trees were large. Deer tracks were all around the trees. I got water at a spring below the orchard. 
Later I stopped at Cherry Gap Shelter for a break. Two women hikers came by. One wanted a picture of a shelter with a person there. Since I was the only one around I was selected. 
Going up Unaka Mountain there was a new color for the day: green. The mountain had plenty of Rhododendrons and firs. One tree had decorations all over it. A hanging sign said the tree was decorated in memory of a 22 year old who died in 2005. 
I was over Unaka at 3:33. I could hear train horns. I haven't heard them in awhile. Then the trail took a switchback down the hillside for a good distance. Up the next long hill I was going to camp in some beautiful fields but a hunter left deer guts right on the trail so I kept going. 
I'm glad I kept going because I went over Beauty Spot. It is a mowed bald and the sun was setting. As I came near the top I heard voices. On top were perhaps 15, up there for the sunset. They came up from a parking lot along a forest service road. They were bundled up. 
I walked through and a few said hello. It was windy and cold but so beautiful. As the sun was going down over the mountains the nearly full moon was up over Unaka Mountain in the other direction. It was about 5:20. 
After a few pictures I kept going hoping to get down in elevation. After about half a mile I settled in among some Rhodys along the trail. 
Tomorrow is a town stop in Erwin, Tennessee. Tomorrow is also Thanksgiving (I hope Dollar General is open). A lot of hikers are going to a hiker feast in Hot Springs, North Carolina. I'm told 150 people will be there. Too many for me. Plus I don't want to lose a day of hiking. I'd have to get a ride over and back. If I were in Hot Springs I'd go but I won't reach Hot Springs until Monday. Guess I'm the Hiker Thanksgiving Scrooge.","Ash Gap

Not sure how I did it but I was up quickly again today. It was cold and the inside of my tent sparkled with frost. But definitely not as cold as yesterday being 1,000' lower in elevation. On the trail at 5:23. 
The trail sparkled also with the frost like a thousand white miniature lights. After crossing a road in the dark I heard a spooky animal call in the woods. Then it made its normal call and I recognized it as a Barred Owl. 
Only an hour in the dark this morning. Looked like a promising good weather day. I thought I haven't heard a train horn today then within 10 seconds I hear the horns. 
I stopped at Curley Maple Shelter for a break. Not sure if Curley Maple is someone's name or if there is a curley maple nearby. Anyway I needed to shave and wash my hair. Need that fluff because it's a town day. It was cold there but I have to look presentable. 
I headed out continuing all morning hiking through thick Rhododendron groves. Several bridges over Jones Creek. 
A fat pit bull looking dog came around the corner at me. It was playful. I moved back and forth in sudden motions and the dog did too. Then I chased it and it ran. Then a white big dog came by and I was a bit more careful. Two ladies came running apologizing. I said nothing to apologize for because I love dogs. Then a guy came by holding back a barking German shepherd. The women warned me it was kind of out of control. 
I came to the Chestoa Pike, the road into Erwin, Tennessee, at 11 a.m. I hoped to blitz into Dollar General and be out by 1 p.m. 
Just as I was getting to a railroad crossing the crossing lights lit up and the bells began ringing. A train came by and it blasted its horn twice real close to me. I knew I should have plugged my ears. But I love the train horns. Seems hiking I frequently hear them at a distance. Here's one real close.
I continued on the road into town. I remembered on this road back in 2012 an old school bus used by a hostel went by. Sterling, the other guy doing the Eastern Continental Trail that year, was on the bus and he saw me. Then the bus stopped. Sterling stopped the bus to get off and walk with me to the store. What a great act of kindness and friendship. We went to the store and he walked back to the AT with me. 
Today it was getting warm. After a mile an old Toyota pickup truck went by, turned around and passed me, then turned around again and offered me a ride. The older gentleman""s southern accent was hard to understand. He took me right to Dollar General. I thanked him and shook his hand. I indeed was grateful for the ride. Walking on pavement hurts my knee. 
I purchased four days worth of food. No Spam for my Thanksgiving day dinner plan; Spam and stuffing. I was so disappointed I forgot the stuffing. Instead I bought four individual frozen hamburgers complete with cheese and bun. 
I went back a different way going the Jackson Highway. There I was walking down the road in the strong sun munching on two frozen hamburgers. Life is good! 
I turned onto Temple Hill Road then River Road which took me back to the AT. Just before the AT is Nolichucky Hostel. I stopped for AquaMira but they had only the big bottles so I didn't buy any. They had Drumsticks there and I bought two. How appropriate for Thanksgiving. I went to pay but she didn't have enough change. So I bought a bunch of Nature's Way Protein bars and paid via credit card. I went out in a picnic table to eat my Drumsticks. The Drumsticks were actually ice cream. 
I crossed the road and began climbing the mountain. It was just after 1 p.m. The trail climbed on countless switchbacks for about two hours. They were easy but endless. I remember coming down them before and I felt the same. But many great views of the mountains, Erwin and the Nolichucky River. 
The trail was good as it traveled again through thick Rhododendrons. A few short ups and downs then a good graded old fire tower road for a distance before returning to regular trail. 
I misread the distance and thought it was longer time-wise than I planned. I thought I might have missed the shelter as I daydreamed while hiking. Then I saw the shelter. No one was there. I went a few hundred feet beyond the shelter then stopped. It was 5:17. 
A good day. A warmer day. Looks like I might make Hot Springs, North Carolina Sunday before dark.","Beauty Spot

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605557,"As I was debating when to get up this morning I heard the winds start up on the ridges. I finally got up and on the trail at 5:08. The full moon was shining bright as I headed down the trail. The only sounds were a small stream flowing, the winds on the ridges, and my feet crunching the leaves. 
As daylight arrived the sky now was all clouds. Rain coming in tomorrow and I hoped not today. As I dropped down and crossed US 19W fog descended into the forest. Also a different club maintains the next section. The trail was pretty tough and muddy the next 12 miles. 
Just up from the highway I went by a grass field. There between the field and I, just off the trail, was a hunter in a hunter's blind. I didn't see him until I was very close. He's supposed to be wearing orange too. We didn't exchange any words. 
Just over the next hill a hunter was walking up the trail. Victor answered my questions about the hunting seasons. He was very friendly and helpful. He was surprised it was so foggy today. We both heard today was to be a nice day. 
I continued up the long climb to Little Bald. At one place I missed the trail and went up a steep side trail to some rocks. Then I realized my mistake when I saw no white blazes and returned to where I missed a turn. The trail continued a steep muddy climb. 
After getting to the top of Little Bald there was nothing there. No view, no rocks, nothing. Just over the top I hit the winds. The winds blowing the fog caused all the bushes and trees to be frosted white, a beautiful sight. 
I got water at a spring then continued to Bald Mountain Shelter. In the windy shelter I made a cup of coffee. Two women came in and asked if I was ""the real deal""? They meant they were day hiking and I was a real hiker. They left heading back the way they came. 
It was 1 p.m. and I estimated I'd get to I-26 around 5 p.m. That will be later than I wanted it to be but the condition of the trail is slowing the Lake Express. 
I headed out and up Big Bald. As I entered the openness of the bald I was amazed. All was beautiful; the grasses, the views, the mountains and the sky. Once I got on top of the 5,526' bald mountain I could see the clouds below me. A 360° view! Every way I looked it was gorgeous. 
It was very windy so after pictures I headed down. There were about 10 other hikers there who probably came up from a nearby resort. 
The trail got down and stayed on the west side of the ridge, mostly out of the wind. I sat on a rock taking a break when I noticed a 6 point buck 20 feet from me. It was at a spring and must have walked there while I was looking at pictures on the phone. I talked to him and he wasn't frightened at all. He just slowly walked away. 
I continued on the trail through the woods then up into the wind. Finally the trail became nice. I cruised along the ridge then into some mowed fields. At the top I met a girl and two guys heading north to camp. The girl and one of the guys hiked the AT in 2014. Then are heading to Bald Mountain Shelter for one night. 
I continued and came to the I-26 underpass right at 5 p.m. After getting beyond the roads and on the trail again I stopped for a break. I estimated I'll get to Hogback Ridge Shelter at 6:40. Its just 2.4 miles but uphill. I got my headlamp out and ready. 
The trail did climb steadily. When I turned the headlight on I noticed flurries. For over a mile the trail followed an old barbed wire fence. A few times a short burst of snow flew by horizontally, due to the wind. 
As I climbed it seemed warmer. My headlamp captured a white moth flapping its wings while stationary on the ground. Is it getting warmer? I hope so. 
After climbing, the trail dropped and at 6:30 I came to the trail to the shelter. At the shelter I placed my pack inside then headed in the dark to get water. It was way down a side trail. It took eight minutes one way but I needed water. 
No one was at the shelter. I set up my tent inside to stay warm and out of the rain. A few times it sounded like sleet hitting the metal roof. I can hear the winds howling but I'm toasty inside. 
I wonder what the storm will bring. Will I wake up to see everything wet or will everything be white?","No Business Knob Shelter
","Hogback Ridge Shelter, NC","Nov 23, Fri",20.70
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605561,"About 8:30 last night a hiker came into the shelter. His name was Fluffy. He actually zoomed by me south of Hampton last Sunday. We talked some in the dark. I stayed in my tent. 
About 9 p.m. it started to rain. It rained all night. I was so glad I pitched my tent in the shelter. About 4:30 a.m. I checked the radar. Looked like the rain would stop in an hour or so. 
I tried to nap but then I needed to go to the privy. I got my rain gear on and headlamp. When I looked outside it was neither wet nor white. Instead all was iced. I headed to the privy in the rain and sleet. It was five minutes away. The privy sat high. It had a roof but the sides were only waist high to someone sitting on the throne. This may be so one could wave at friends. The front had no door and it faced right into the storm. The step up to the throne was iced as well as the seat of the throne. Plus rain and sleet were hitting the seat. Whatever I decided to do is proprietary information at this time. 
Back at the shelter I got into my tent. All was packed except the tent. I made a cup of coffee. I decided I'll leave at 6 no matter what. The delay today might dash my plan to get to Hot Springs tomorrow. I was hoping for a long day. 
At 5:30 the rain slowed. I quietly packed up the tent. When I exited the shelter the full moon was out! I headed up to the trail arriving at 6:05. Initially I had the headlamp on at the shelter but turned it off because the moon was so bright. I briefly shined it on a trail sign to check the mileage to the next shelter. Ice hung down from the sign. 
On the trail the moon was right in front of me. The trail looked like a white line as the ice and water reflected the moonlight. Anything iced was shining. A beautiful morning. 
The trail descended and the forest was just wet at lower elevation. Lots of water running and lots of puddles. 
At 8 a.m. I took a break. A guy came down the trail behind me. I said ""Fluffy?"" And he responded ""Lake?"" We talked in the dark last night so this was the first we saw each other. We talked for 10 minutes then he headed out. 
The trail dropped and went by some waterfalls, crossed two roads then up to a ridge again. I took my rain gear off and my jacket. 
Before Flint Mountain Shelter the sun came out for a short time. Then a few showers hit and the rain gear went back on. 
At the shelter I made coffee and took a long break. As I left fog came in and it would persist into the evening. 
A few hours later I stopped at Jerry Cabin Shelter at 3:30. It was windy and getting cold as I have been going up in elevation. I got a liter of water then packed up. When I saw it was already 4 p.m. I thought I better get my headlamp out but I couldn't find it. I began pulling everything out of my pack. No light meant no night hiking. I wouldn't reach Hot Springs tomorrow. But finally it was right where it was supposed be but it slid down under two plastic containers. Relieved, I continued hiking. 
Due to the wind and the fog I opted to take two short bad weather trails. Around 6 p.m. the headlamp was in use. 
The trail climbed from Jerry Cabin Shelter for three hours to Camp Creek Bald. Since I couldn't see more than ten feet in front of me due to the fog and darkness I only knew I passed the bald when the trail started to descend at about 7 p.m. 
A bright white eye really scared me for a moment. Then I realized it was just a reflective thumb tack. 
The fog was so thick I feared I'd miss the shelter. At 7:45 the trail split. I wondered which way to go then my headlamp lit up a building. I was at the shelter. 
I put my gear in the stone structure then searched for the water source. I had to look in my guide which said it was down a blue blaze trail behind the shelter. It took me five minutes to find the trail in the dark and fog. After getting water I put my tent up in the shelter since no one else was there. 
A not so interesting day due to the fog limiting what I could see. I now have less than 300 miles to go. And I made it to my planned  destination despite the rain delay. Looks like Hot Springs tomorrow after all.","Hogback Ridge Shelter

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605567,"The mice were having a party in the stone shelter last night. I could hear them chewing and running around. 
I woke up before 4 a.m. expecting to still see fog outside. I was very delighted to see moonlight through the trees. 
After coffee, packing up and hitting my head on the shelter's low roof beams several times I was on the trail at 4:58 a.m. The moon was shining brightly. Venus was visible above the eastern horizon. Looks like a beautiful day is awakening. 
After daylight arrived I could see the mountain tops were in the clear while the valleys held fog. Some of the valleys looked like vast lakes as the fog covered the lowlands. The warmth of the sunshine felt good. 
The trail was in very good condition and I was making good time. I estimated I'd reach Hot Springs at approximately 4 p.m. 
I walked in shorts all day. I started out with my rain top over my jacket over my vest over my long sleeve over my sleeveless. In the afternoon I only had the sleeveless on. 
Late in the afternoon a big calorically-challenged Border Collie appeared out of nowhere in front of me. It was slightly playful but afraid of me. As I walked it would back up. Once it backed right into a tree. Another time it backed over the bank. I finally got around it, then it sat down as I went on. Then it caught up to me. A short time later its owner hiked by and the dog joined him. 
At the last climb before the descent into Hot Springs it became very windy. I had to put my long sleeve shirt on. I dropped down out of the wind as the trail entered the French Broad River valley. 
At Lovers Leap a family of four were enjoying the view and sunshine as I took a picture of Hot Springs. They asked me a lot of questions about my trip like: when did I start, when do I expect to finish. They congratulated me. 
I continued on the trail downhill to another vista. Another family of four was enjoying the views and the day. They asked me similar questions about my trip as the other family did and offered congratulations. As I left and headed downhill it finally hit me that this long journey would soon be over and tears came to my eyes. I told myself to knock it off. No emotions. Big boys don't cry. All was well again. 
A man, perhaps in his 70's was coming up the hill using trekking poles. I moved out of the way because on the trail people ascending have the right-of-way. He stopped and asked about my trip, too. When he left he patted me on my shoulder with his left hand and said ""Congratulations."" That kind gesture caused me to lose my emotions. I am so grateful for making it this far. I want it to end but I don't want it to end. I am so tired. 
As I dropped down to the French Broad River I could see it running high. The water was right up to the top of its banks. All I could hear is the roaring river to my left as I walked to the highway bridge contemplating the conclusion of this journey. 
I crossed the bridge over the river at 3:15. Near the railroad tracks a group was decorating a tree for Christmas. Some turned to look at me and as I waved they returned the wave. I walked through the little town amazed at all the people shopping or going to a busy restaurant. A large tree was already decorated for Christmas and a Nativity was on display. Yes, I thought, Christmas is not far away. 
I stopped at Dollar General for Hot Pockets, mouth wash, BBQ chips and milk. I figured I would not want to venture out tonight from the hostel. 
I was tempted to stop at the Smoky Mountain Diner but when I checked the hours it was closed Sundays. I'll be there for breakfast in the morning. 
I walked up NC 209. The town has the Appalachian Trail logo embedded into the sidewalks. After crossing the road I walked up 50 steps (I always count steps) and there was Laughing Heart Hostel. 
I got a private room. The room, a shower and laundry for $40. I haven't had a shower or had laundry done in 11 days. I did not like the smell when I was in my sleeping bag. It's been too cold to jump in a creek. 
I took a long shower. I did laundry. The washer is inside the hostel and the dryer is outside. After all was done I was glad to be clean and dry once again. And a day ahead of schedule. 
As of now I'll enter the Great Smoky Mountains National Park Wednesday morning. My worry concerning the park is that it is the highest part of the trail and it is late November. However the weather kind of looks good regarding precipitation except for Saturday, which would be the day I exit the park. 
In the park you MUST stay IN the shelters unless they are full; then you can tent outside. I'd rather stay in my tent because it's 10-15 degrees warmer. It will be cold up there. 
My strategy is to camp just outside the park Tuesday night. Wednesday and Thursday I'll be at shelters. Friday night I'll be at a park tent site down 2,000' in elevation. Then out of the park Saturday. 
Clingmans Dome is in the Smoky's and is the highest point on the Appalachian Trail at 6,643'. It will be cold and Jack Frost will be nipping at more than my nose. 
I'm a little concerned but will persevere. When I cross Fontana Dam at the park's southern boundary I'll only have 166 miles to go.","Little Laurel Shelter

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605579,"Sleep was good to me last night. I was up early and headed to the Smoky Mountain Diner. It was a spring-like day. I ordered a Southwest Omelet. It was different from other southwest omelets I've had. This one was full of corn and beans. 
Still on the wall was a picture of Cape Gaspe, Quebec, where I hiked to in 2012 and signed by Nimblewill Nomad. 
Two guys sitting on opposite sides of the restaurant talked loudly about bears. I think they were trying to scare me. ""Yup, its a regular bear preserve up there on the mountain,"" one said. 
I went back to the hostel to pack. Then I headed to the outfitter and post office. It now was cold and windy. As I rounded a corner a blast of wind hit and thousands of leaves came up the street at me. I had to protect my eyes. It was amazing. It was like the movie The Birds except instead of birds it was leaves. 
I recovered from the leaf trauma and went to Bluff Mountain Outfitters. I purchased AquaMira. Then I picked up a package at the post office sent by Heartrock. It was full of food and treats. 
My final stop was at Dollar General for food. I needed six days worth to get through the Smoky Mountains. 
Back at the hostel I packed up and was on the trail at 10:30. It was windy and looked like rain or snow. 
The trail was well graded all day. I kept a watch on the clouds as the trail climbed to Bluff Mountain. I crested the mountain at 4:50. 
I remember back in April 2012 as Sterling, Metro North, and a few others got up early at the Walnut Mountain Shelter to push into Hot Springs for breakfast (which we didn't make it in time). At Bluff Mountain the sun had just come over the horizon. It was bright orange. One of the guys was standing on a boulder as I got there. I took a picture of him. It was just his silhouette against the sun. I thought it was cool someone stopped and was taking in the beautiful sunrise. 
Today it was windy and cold on Bluff Mountain. A fog hung around the summit and all the trees and bushes were frosted white. 
I went by the Walnut Mountain Shelter in the dark just before 6 p.m. I had just turned my headlamp on. I did not plan to stay there because it was a small old shelter plus the guidebook said the neighborhood bears are not afraid of hikers. My goal was a campsite 1.5 miles farther. 
After the shelter the trail went through some fields. It was flurrying and it would continue all night. 
I missed the campsite. The book said it was next to a creek and an old road. I saw the creek but not the road. Thinking I needed needed to go a bit farther I continued. Then I realized I did go too far. I turned around then headed back. Then I turned around again and decided to continue to Roaring Fork Shelter in about 3 miles. 
The trail climbed and crossed some streams. At one stream three uneven logs crossed over. All were icy from the flurries, even the railing. It was slow going across. 
I saw two eyes to my left, I thought. It looked like a big owl. Then I realized It was two lights from a facility on top of the ridge. 
After I crossed another slippery bridge I thought I had a mile to go yet. But a short distance later were two signs pointing to the shelter. I was so happy. It was 8:15. 
Inside the shelter I put my tent up to stay warm. No one was there. I can hear the wind pushing through the forest. Sometimes it blows the tarp covering the open side of the shelter violently. 
Glad I came the extra miles making tomorrow easier. Now in for a cold night.","Laughing Heart Hostel, Hot Springs, NC

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605593,"It didn't seem so cold when I got up. Maybe I have a good system staying warm while I pack up in the mornings. But I was a little surprised when I shined the headlamp outside to see it all white. 
I was on the trail at 6:20. Not much snow, less than an inch. I left later than usual because I not only went a few miles further than planned but also I wanted it to be daylight on top of Max Patch. 
I only used my headlamp for a short time as I climbed the two miles to the summit of Max Patch. Max Patch is vast open meadows on top of the mountain with gorgeous views of neighboring mountains. Someone described it as being in Switzerland. 
But today there were no views. The summit was in the clouds and all the grasses and bushes were frosted white. Though I lost the views I found beauty in the winter wonderland. 
The wind was brisk as I descended the hilltop. The trail followed old roads and good trail. At about 10:35 I came to the side trail to Groundhog Creek Shelter. 
I decided go the .2 to the shelter. I got water and made coffee. My water bottle had ice in it from last night. I headed out about 11:15. 
The trail was still snow covered with occasional animal tracks. As I climbed Snowbird Mountain up to the FAA towers I was in the clouds again. Like Max Patch this morning all was frosted white on top of Snowbird.
I descended towards Davenport Gap on gentle but seemingly endless switchbacks. Most of the snow at the lower elevation had melted. I saw a bobcat jump onto a snow covered log and slowly walk across it above a stream. The only other critter I saw all day was a squirrel. I saw no hikers. 
At 3:30 I went under I-40 following a local road. The trail followed the road across the Pigeon River. Just across the bridge a white Tennessee Department of Transportation pickup slowed to my pace. A few guys were in the truck. The driver asked if I was doing the AT. He asked when I started. He said I have only one more state to go. He said it's his dream to do the AT some day. I thanked them for talking to me. They turned around and all waved as I did when they drove by. I needed that encouragement. 
The trail left the road and climbed along a creek with plenty of waterfalls. A few big downed trees were an obstacle but I got through. 
About 4 p.m. I saw a campsite near where the creek split. This was my destination for the day. It is only 1.3 miles to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park boundary and I don't want to go in until tomorrow. If I enter I must stay at a shelter. I want to tent as much as possible to stay as warm as possible. However tomorrow night and the next night I have no choice. Hopefully I can set my tent up inside. 
I admit I am a bit anxious about the next few days. It is cold in the valleys so it will be tough up there. There may be plenty of snow up there, too. But I know three Sobo thru hikers are just one day ahead of me so I can follow their footprints if necessary. There is a wind chill advisory tonight so I hope they are safe in a shelter somewhere. They signed the register yesterday morning at the shelter I stayed at last night. There was Sammertime, Fluffy and another guy. 
After two nights I will be much lower in elevation, however there is a chance of rain. Just two weeks from tomorrow I expect to finish. I must keep that in mind as an incentive.","Roaring Fork Shelter, NC

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605608,"I did not sleep well due to my concern about what I'd face in the Smokys. I was worried about the wind, the snow, and the cold. I started packing up just before 3 a.m. 
On the trail at 3:51. It wasn't too cold but I could hear the wind up on the ridges. Within 10 minutes I was too hot and removed my long sleeve shirt. 
I reached the boundary of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park at 4:30. A metal square box there read ""AT thru hikers deposit permits here"" so I did. Then I thought that makes no sense. I'll be in the park with no permit. I concluded the box is for north bound through hikers.and it should say so. Fortunately the box was pretty full and I was able to fish my permit out with mild difficulty. 
The trail climbs 3,000' in five miles. I was prepared for a slow long climb. At Davenport Gap Shelter I had to take my rain jacket off because I was too warm. 
When I reached the top I had to put the rain jacket back on due to the wind and cold. But I arrived earlier than I expected so I was happy with that. There was 1-2 inches of snow on the trail. I was happy there wasn't more. The winds were brutal when I hit them head on but the trail seemed to stay out of the winds most of the day. 
Just after sunrise I got a good picture of the stonework along the trail. From near the place I reached the top of the mountain all the way to Newfound Gap it is a wide graded trail constructed by the CCC in the 1930s. 
At Tri-Corner Knob Shelter I took a break. I arrived earlier than expected. I tried to treat a liter of water I got from the spring but the AquaMira froze within five minutes. It was so cold. I later kept the water inside my rain jacket but it got slushy even in there. 
The privy was one of those with the sides just halfway up. I guess its so you can wave at friends or moon them. But being in a national park the inside was handicap accessible. It had railing all around to hold onto and to help get seated on the throne. They had to follow the rules when building it in a national park. 
I could see the tracks of three people coming out from Tri-Corner Knob Shelter. I'm sure they belonged to Sammertime, Fluffy and Woody. 
The trail was beautiful as well as the views. My camera was too cold to take some pictures. I felt warm most of the day as long as I kept moving. 
At 5:02 I reached the side trail to Peck's Corner Shelter and headed the .4 down the trail. I didn't expect to reach the shelter until 7. But good trail and lack of snow helped me cruise in. 
I am relieved it was not a brutal windy day and that there wasn't much snow. However I'm in for a very cold night. 
I saw no humans at all today. Critterwise I only saw two small birds. A surprisingly beautiful and safe day.","State Line Branch Creek, TN

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605613,"It indeed was cold last night in the little valley the shelter was located in. My shoes and the water bottles were partially frozen even though they were inside the tent. I got dressed in my sleeping bag then got my stove going. It got to 50 degrees in the tent. Good enough to pack up and head out. I put my Yak Tracks on because of a lot of ice on the trails. Really bad on the access trail up to the AT. 
On the the AT at 5:02. Already I had to take a shirt off underneath. It seemed warmer after I came out of the valley. Warm air may be pushing in. Temperatures are to increase the next few days. 
Up on the ridge I could see the colors of a beautiful sunrise developing. Venus was bright as well as the half moon almost directly above me. 
The trail left the east side of the narrow ridge and followed the west side. I was unable to see the sun actually coming up. On the west side the winds hit me but weren't nearly as brutally cold as yesterday. Snow here and there but nothing slowing me. 
I passed Charlie's Bunion and headed to Icewater Spring Shelter. There I treated water and took my long johns off. The sun warmed my wet feet as I tried to wring out my socks. It was a beautiful sunny day. 
When I got back on the trail I now expected to see people since I was near Newfound Gap. Shortly I saw day hikers coming up the trail. Before I got to the gap I saw 25+ people. 
One family talked a little with me and asked about my trip. When the young father with his one year old on his back said ""Congratulations"" right away I about cried as I realized how close to finishing I am. I headed out but before the gap I had to take my jacket off. The young father and a teen boy ahead of the others walked to the gap with me. We talked all the way down. He and his wife dream of doing the trail someday. I thanked them then headed towards the crosswalk across the highway. But then I saw trash receptacles and got rid of some extra weight. The young father's father (or father-in-law) came over and talked with me. He asked all kinds of questions about my journeys. 
The parking lot was busy due to the great views there. I crossed the highway and disappeared into the woods. Shortly I passed a couple and they asked about my trip. When I told them they said they had to get a picture of me which they did. 
A while later I heard voices. It was two guys and a girl from Rochester, NY coming up behind me fast. I thought they were thru hikers because of their speed. They weren't but are future thru hikers, perhaps in the spring. They had plenty of questions too. The one guy shook my hand as well as the girl then I, for fun, showed them the thru hiker shake hitting fist to fist. We all shook hands the thru hiker way. They said they were out just for a few days. 
I continued taking a few hours to get up to the top of Clingman's Dome the highest point on the AT at 6,643'. The weather had changed and now the sky was cloudy. I kept an eye on the clouds as I went over Clingman's Dome at 4:30. Just beyond Clingman's Dome I went under 200 miles to the finish. 
The wind had picked up and it started to sprinkle. I was planning to go to Siler's Bald Shelter but decided to stop at Double Springs Gap Shelter instead due to the rain and it was getting dark. 
I arrived at the stone shelter about 6 pm. I walked down into the dark foggy woods looking for the spring using my headlamp but found nothing. I went across the trail in the opposite direction and down a steep trail. I found water good enough to suit me. It wasn't a spring but instead water coming down over rocks. It was slow filling my bottles but I was happy to find water. 
At the shelter I put my tent up behind the tarp. Like other shelters in the park there is a tarp to block the wind. Since my tent is too high for the bunk area I just set up in front of it. No one around and I want to be warm. Though not bad out now I am at 5,507' and it's raining. 
The two guys and the girl I met said rain the next two days. That kind of bummed me out. I want to get to Franklin sometime Tuesday. I'll have to push through the rain.

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605632,"Rain overnight and into the morning. I heated up coffee and noticed my thermometer in the tent hit 90! That indicated to me it wasn't terribly cold out. 
I put on my wet rain jacket, wet rain pants, wet socks and wet shoes. I could hear the rain on and off hitting the steel roof hard. I threw the poncho successfully over my head and backpack. 
I headed out into the rain at 5:20 a.m. It wasn't too cold and I warmed up to a comfortable level. 
Into the dark foggy morning about 20 minutes I started to worry because I had not seen any white blazes. I debated about turning around then I finally saw one and was very relieved. 
I stopped at Derrick Knob Shelter for coffee and a shave. I got the water down steep steps out of an old pipe at the spring. I made coffee then heated water for the shave. I figured I would not feel like shaving tonight or tomorrow morning. The rain was pounding on the steel roof as I got ready to head out. 
I would see no humans the entire day. I did see two turkeys, or three, if you count me. I flushed out a grouse but only heard it fly through the fog. I could see plenty of severely torn up soil from the wild hogs in the park.
The day was boring and wet. It was foggy so no views. I kept my mind busy by daydreaming about next two weeks. Though I wasn't thrilled with the rain I was happy it was not snow. It rained so much today if it had been snow it would be several feet deep. 
Going up over Rocky Top and Thunderhead Mountains offered some change in scenery. The trail was whitewater going up and coming down. Lots of small cascades. On top of Rocky Top it was open and at 5,441' it was windy and chilly. 
An obstacle besides the rain was that the trail was terribly eroded. That slowed my paced considerably. Then, at about 3 p.m., the trail was great. I started cruising. Several miles of newer graded trail. I did slide once in the mud landing on my left side. No damage reported. 
I climbed the last hill on switchbacks hoping to get to Mollies Ridge Shelter before dark and be able to find the water source. I arrived, in the rain of course, at about 5:45. No one there. 
I found the water source then returned to the shelter. Since it is a bit warmer I decided to just sleep in the upper bunk area. 
Though my outer rain gear and shoes, etc., were soaked, my inner clothes and my gear in my backpack were dry. 
Tomorrow just around 13 miles. I need to go into Fontana Village for a resupply. The resort is two miles off the trail. If raining I'll return to the Fontana Dam Shelter and stay there. The shelter has showers and electricity. It is called the Fontana ""Hilton"" by hikers. 
Right beside me I heard a noise but couldn't figure out what it was. Then I saw it: a mouse was licking my peanut butter jar. I chased it away twice. This is one reason I like to stay in a tent.

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605654,"About 1:30 a.m. the winds began to roar. The tarp in front of the shelter was dancing wildly. Rain was pounding the roof. All I could do is hope all would be well by 5 a.m. 
Before 4 a.m. I started to pack up. Last night, due to that crazy mouse that wouldn't leave me alone, I slid my sleeping bag into the tent. I didn't set it up with the poles I just had the tent screens over me to keep that little pesky bastard off me and my gear. I chased the crummy critter away while I was packing up. All was packed and, after putting on my wet rain gear, socks and shoes, I faced the wild weather outside. 
As I exited the shelter I saw the moon in its waning crescent stage. Could the rain be over? 
Before dark last night I went out to make sure I would leave on the right trail. There were the trails in and out, of course. Plus there were three others; one to the spring, one to the bear cables, and one to the poop field. Yes, the poop field because there is no privy here. I knew it would be foggy in the morning so I checked the trail before bedtime. 
On the trail I did not see any blazes after I started. Again I was worried but pretty confident I was on the trail. Just needed some reassurance. Then, after half an hour, I finally saw one and felt better. 
The wind was brutal when I hit it head on. I needed to get over two 5,000' mountains. 
I saw beautiful colors just before sunrise and hoped the day would be good. But at 7:30 the rain started. My hope of a good day blew away with the wind. 
I struggled to continue both physically and mentally. The fatigue of the journey was catching up fast. Thoughts of people who bug me started bugging me. 
I think it was at Sassafras Gap that the trail swung away from the dividing line between Tennessee and North Carolina that I straddled for a week or so. Now I am totally in North Carolina until I hit the Georgia state line. 
After seemingly endless switchbacks, I came to a rectangle brown steel canister that said for thru hikers to deposit their permits in it. I finally found the right place to drop my permit. I came to a well constructed dead end road that the trail followed to Fontana Dam. The road was promised to local towns as compensation for the dam project. But the government only built it so far and quit. 
At about 11 a.m. I came to Fontana Dam on the Little Tennessee River and crossed over. The rain had stopped but the wind continued. I followed the road until the trail broke off going down a paved path that ended at the Fontana Dam ""Hilton"" Shelter. 
The shelter overlooked the lake. It had a solar electronic charger. I looked for the showers but didn't see one. Then I thought it must be at the small public bathrooms up the trail. I went back up expecting the water to be shut off. I was amazed when I went in and turned the shower on. It worked and was hot. I went back to get my soap and towel and took a needed hot shower. That made up for the cold, miserable morning. 
Back at the shelter I noticed I lost my cellphone waterproof bag. I figured I lost it on the other side of the dam but didn't want to carry my pack all the way over to look for it. I needed to head to the Fontana Village Resort. 
I had to take my pack with me since there were no bear boxes at the shelter. I left for the resort going two miles on a super curvy road. The rain had started again. 
As I neared the Fontana Pitstop I saw no vehicles and wondered if it was open. After I came around the front corner of the store it was open and I was happy. 
Inside I got a delicious BBQ pulled pork sandwich and a Coke. I also got three days of food to get me to Franklin. When I went to pay I couldn't unzip the rain pant's zipper. The sweet lady there even reached over the counter to try to unzip my back pants pocket. I hoped no one was watching! She couldn't get it either. Finally I broke the zipper and I paid my bill. 
Back out onto the highway and back to the shelter. I considered hiking another hour south on the trail but it wouldn't be worth having a wet tent. 
I decided I'd go look for the cell phone bag since it was only 2:30. I placed my pack in the bathroom with the shower then headed the mile and a half back across the dam to where I deposited my park permit. That is where I took out my cell phone to get it ready for a picture of the dam. I searched going over and back but I didn't see it. 
Back at the shelter just as I got in it began to rain hard. It didn't last but I thought if I had hiked on and got hit by that I'd be a very, very unhappy camper. 
I put up my tent in the shelter. Earlier I had checked my pack twice for the cellphone bag and didn't find it. When I hung my pack up to dry all was out of it. When I dumped out the little bag of dry items, there was the cellphone bag. How it got in there I gave up trying to figure out. I was happy to find it because I hate it when I lose something.

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605707,"I didn't mention yesterday that when I crossed the Fontana Dam I was out of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Also Hash, who I first met near the Massachusetts/Connecticut border and saw him recently in Damascus, Virginia, is off the trail after getting frostbite a few days ago. He will finish the trail in the spring. 
Today I woke up before 3 a.m. and I was halfway out of my sleeping bag. The reason was because it was so warm. I decided to pack up. Most of my gear had dried after hanging all night but my socks and shoes were still wet. The waning crescent moon looked like a smiley face and its brightness reflected off the lake. 
I was on the trail at 4:25. After an hour hiking in the dark and gaining elevation I could see the lit up slanted face of Fontana Dan. The white lights on the crest of the dam looked like a row of white Christmas lights. Below the dam was the operations center with its bright lights. I'd see the lights of the dam until daybreak as the trail switchbacked up the mountain. 
Even in the dark it was warm enough that I was hiking in shorts and a sleeveless top. When the sun came up the day was warm and beautiful. I enjoyed the warmth of the sun on me. 
The trail was a gentle climb all day with a few descents. From the marina at 1,170' to Cheoah Bald at 5,062' the trail was mostly well graded. 
At the first shelter I met a young couple hiking the AT in a 15 year plan going north. Today they will have completed the trail from Springer Mountain to Fontana Dam. Her name was Redbull and his name was Mark (he didn't have a trail name yet). 
The day was simply a warm beautiful day following very good trail. I stopped at Stecoah Gap after crossing a highway and saw picnic tables. My socks had dried hanging on my backpack so I exchanged one pair with the wet pair I had on. (I think it was last night in the shelter I thought I smelled something dead then realized it was my wet socks). 
Going up towards Cheoah Bald I was thinking I hadn't seen a thru hiker for eight days. The last I saw was Fluffy. Not long after that a woman comes up behind me and she was a thru hiker. She said there was a bubble of 12 more coming. Then came Fluffy. After that came Toots. I hadn't seen him since Gorham, New Hampshire. While I was battling the cold and rain in the Smoky's this group was warm and dry at the Fontana Village Resort. Life isn't fair. 
I arrived at the top of Cheoah Bald at 5 p.m. What a great view of the mountains I'll be in tomorrow. 
I continued onward as I did not want to hike into the dark tonight. The wind was blowing pretty well at this elevation. 
I arrived at Sassafras Gap Shelter at 5:40. At the shelter was Toots and three older guys out for the night. We talked until after dark. I got water then went up the hill to set up my tent. I made my destination for the day. 
Tomorrow I need to do around the same mileage then that is it for long days. After that it will be less than 14 mile days until I finish. Only 10 daze to go and only 143.6 miles.","The Fontana Dam ""Hilton"" Shelter

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605708,"I slept well and was up and on the trail at 4:29 a.m. The smiling waning crescent moon was shining just above Venus. Today will be my last long day. 
It was a long mostly graded descent from Sassafras Gap Shelter at 4,330' down to Nantahala River at 1,723'. I reached the river and crossed the bridge at the Nantahala Outdoor Center at 8:15. 
I was hoping to have breakfast at the River's End Restaurant but it did not open until 11. Across the highway was Wesser General Store. No hot breakfast there but they did have hot coffee. I also purchased donuts and a moon pie. After finishing my breakfast I bought a Coke, two Snickers and two Twizzlers for the trail. I left around 9 a.m. 
The day was beautiful and mild. Now I had a climb up to Wesser Bald at 4,627'. The trail was excellent. It would climb then level off repeatedly. The views were outstanding. I could look back at the fields on Cheoah Bald where I was yesterday. At the top of Wesser Bald was an observation tower with excellent views all around including the Smoky's. 
A drop in elevation then a climb up Copper Ridge Bald at 5,080'. 
The mountain of course had no leaves on the trees. This was no different than when I headed north in the Spring during previous thru hikes. Though in the Spring the ground was full of flowers. ""The birds were in the air, there were flowers everywhere. Think of me and I'll be there. We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun and the mountains that we climbed were just seasons out of time."" (Try to get that song out of your mind today). 
At Cold Springs Shelter about 4 p.m. I saw Old Scout, a white haired and bearded man. I met him in New England somewhere when he was hiking north from Harper's Ferry. After reaching Katahdin he flipped to Harper's Ferry and headed south. He didn't remember me. I told him this is my fourth and final thru hike. He said ""For me: one and I'm done. For you: four and no more."" I said I like that. 
My plan was to push to Wayah Shelter. That would be a 23.4 mile day. Then tomorrow I would only have 11 miles to the highway that goes to Franklin. Today would be my last long day. After the 11 tomorrow I only have to do 13.65 mile days to finish on the 12th. 
The trail continued to be excellent. It was well graded up these mountains. Maybe someday this trail technology could be exported to the northern states and applied to the trails there. 
The sky was pink above the mountains after sunset. What a beautiful sight. I stopped at one view to take a picture. After I started on the trail again I saw Toot coming up the trail. With him were two young guys I haven't met before. They were S.O.S. and Mantis. 
We all pushed the last few miles to the shelter. Toot and S.O.S. disappeared into the dusk ahead of me while Mantis stopped to take in the remaining sunset. It was a beautiful evening and I enjoyed pushing the miles on my last long day as well as being with other hikers doing the same. 
I used my night vision right up until I reached Wayah Shelter at about 6:30. (Wayah means wolf in Cherokee). The other guys were getting water. I got my tent set up, then I got water. The stars were beautiful. There was a cold wind blowing. 
I returned to my tent a bit cold. After getting in I made Applewood bacon instant mashed potatoes. The potato packages were for emergencies but I used one just to have something warm. A good day, a very good day.","Sassafras Gap, NC

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605802,"Overnight I got really cold. Though the winds died down I had to put on my heavy socks and my jacket. I felt a lot warmer but did not look forward to morning. 
I kept trying to sleep as I did not want to leave before 5 a.m. Finally, after 4 a.m., I got my stove going to warm up the tent. I packed up and  was on the trail at 5:03 a.m. 
The wind wasn't bad. It started flurrying with some heavy bursts. Before I reached Wayah Bald everything was coated white. The trees and bushes once again sparkled like a thousand miniature Christmas lights. 
At the top of Wayah Bald at 5,342' feet is a stone observation tower. It was too dark so I did not go up. Back at the shelter I could see plenty of lights in the valleys below but none on top of the mountain. The flurries had stopped. 
Later as I was heading down the south side of Wayah Bald the eastern sky was orange. The day had begun though I would not see the actual sunrise. 
The trail was great right to Winding Stair Gap, US 64. I arrived at 10:50 a.m. after doing 11 miles. 
The trail went a short distance west along the highway then crossed over to a parking area. There I started hitching east towards Franklin. After 20 vehicles a silver Toyota Tundra pulled over. Ron and Judy live nearby and frequently give rides to hikers. They retired here from Florida and love these mountains. 
Just after I put my pack in the bed of the truck Toot came up the road and joined us. At 11:30 we were at Ingles near town. We thanked Rod and Judy for their generosity. I dislike hitching but I always meet wonderful people like them. 
Toots went to Ingles for resupply and was heading back to the trail today. I headed downtown. I wanted to do laundry and get my mop cut. I don't think I had it cut since March or April and I'm starting to look a bit mangy. Losing so much weight and having raggedy hair, I look a bit ragged. I guess I should after 2,081 miles. 
I went downtown but the two places for haircuts were closed plus I did not find the laundry. Heartrock told me there was a laundry at Westgate Plaza which was all the way back near Ingles. I went there and got my laundry done. I stopped at Subway and purchased a foot long meatball sub and a foot long cold cut sub. 
While at the laundromat I booked a room at Microtel nearby and since it was after 3 p.m. I got right into my room. After eating the meatball sub I got cleaned up. I also called Jim's Shuttles and arranged a shuttle for the morning back to the trail. 
Then I headed to Ingles but first I met Jim the shuttle guy at the front desk. He is a friend of Annette who was working the front desk. He said he'd pick me up at 7 a.m. At first I thought that's early but is actually late for me which is totally fine. 
After getting eight days worth of food I walked back up the busy highway to the motel. I ate the other sub and a half gallon of vanilla fudge swirl ice cream. Calorie shock! Then several hot baths. 
The weather will turn for the worse the next few days. First colder weather then several days of rain and snow. I think I'll just push on, though, like I did in the Smoky's.

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605816,"I was up at 4 a.m. to pack up. At 6:30 I went out for the breakfast and I was the first one. Needless to say but I made a mess of the waffle maker. 
At 7:15 Jim's Shuttle picked me up then Jim went to a hostel to pick up two other hikers. Jim is a retired AT&T engineer. 
At the hostel the other hikers were Toot and S.O.S. I didn't expect to see them again. Jim took us up US 64 to Winding Stairs Gap. He dropped us off and we thanked him. He only takes donations so I gave him $11.
It was cold up on the mountain! In town it was to be high 30's so it had to be way below that up there. 
Toot and S.O.S. headed out. I had eight days of food so I knew I'd be slow. Looked like a cold but sunny day. 
Not too far up the trail Highlights came by. I just met her a few days ago going up Cheoah Bald. A short time later Fluffy went by. He is finishing on the 11th now so I probably won't see him again. 
A few miles on two young couples I heard about passed me. Am I slow today or what?! Most of the hikers that went by are stopping in Hiawassee up ahead to sit out the pending storm. 
The trail was great right up until Albert Mountain. The mountain is at 5,250'. I didn't climb the fire tower but I did not need to because the views from the base were great. 
A bit steep going down the mountain then great trail afterwards. The trail was well graded and hiking was like walking on a narrow gauge railroad bed. 
The wind picked up in the afternoon. As I went up Ridgepole Mountain I had to put on my rain jacket to keep me warm. 
I arrived at Carter Gap Shelter at 4:40. No one else was there. I got water then found a place out of the wind. It was cold. Temperature in the tent is 25. Can't be any worse than my first day in the Smoky's one week ago today.","Franklin, NC
",Carter Gap Shelter,"Dec 05, Wed",15.90
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605832,"Around 12:30 this morning the wind was blowing hard. It fortunately was going over me for the most part. It was cold. Colder than last week, the first day in the Smoky's. and I thought that was cold. 
Not as much wind before dawn. A breeze seemed to keep the heat from my stove from heating my tent. It was cold! One water bottle I had in my shoe in the tent was frozen. The other one I put in my pack was fine. If both were frozen and I couldn't make coffee I'd be one grumpy hiker all day. I got on the trail at 6:32. 
An hour later I saw one of the couples who passed me by yesterday. Her name was Lost and Found and his name was Search and Rescue. They were packing up their gear. The other couple had already left. It wasn't long before they flew by me. 
After two hours of hiking I warmed up enough to take off my rain jacket and my long sleeve shirt under my regular jacket. I was starting to sweat. While changing I made coffee on a moss covered log. 
The day was beautiful. The sun was shining and it should warm up some. 
I began the climb up Standing Indian Mountain. It was a long but nicely graded trail all the way up. Mantis came down and a short time later Just Dave. They were slack packing this section. 
Standing Indian Mountain is one of my favorite spots along the trail. The view at its flat summit is looking south at the beautiful mountains of North Carolina and Georgia. At 5,498' this is the last mountain above 5,000' for Sobos. 
Every spring old fashion fluffy yellow daffodils bloom on top of the mountain that someone planted there ages ago. After hiking over Standing Indian Mountain in 2008 as I was thru hiking north I stopped in Franklin for a few days. As I walked down one of the streets downtown I saw a painting in a gift shop of old fluffy yellow daffodils against some rocks. I inquired about the painting and was told the local artist paints scenes from the mountains nearby. She said it could be from up on Standing Indian Mountain. 
That was good enough for me so I bought the painting. Whenever I see it I think of the old daffodils up on Standing Indian Mountain. 
The trail dropped off the mountain on old roads, then wound through the rhododendron mountain tops all afternoon. I was warm enough to take my restrictive rain pants off and hike in shorts but I kept my fleece jacket on. 
At 3:53 I left North Carolina and entered Georgia! Only 77.9 miles to go from the border. (Yesterday I went below the 100 miles mark near Albert Mountain). 
I continued a few more miles wanting to get as low in elevation as possible to hopefully be warmer. I stopped at Blue Ridge Gap at 5:30. Last night I camped at 4,540' and tonight I'm at 3,020', a little better and it is indeed warmer outside. 
Looks like tomorrow will be a good hiking day. But Saturday I may have to hunker down in a shelter due to heavy rain. With less than a week to go I am not excited or emotional due to the cold and the pending storm. Once the storm is over Sunday around noon I can think of that finish line on Springer Mountain. From this camping spot it is 74.8 miles.","Carter Gap Shelter

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605837,"It certainly was not as cold as yesterday this morning. I packed up with little concern for the cold. I did put my rain gear on just in case. 
I left at 6:36 starting with a climb. It wasn't long before my rain jacket and long sleeve shirt were off. I just wore my fleece jacket over my vest and other shirt. 
A little sunrise to my left but clouds covered it up eventually. I took a break and just then it started to sleet. I put my rain jacket back on but the sleet didn't last long. The sky looked as if it would rain or snow at any minute. 
A northbound girl went by with an enormous backpack and we exchanged hellos. A short time later two guys were just off the trail with backpacks. Then just around the corner three people came by asking if I saw the two guys backpacking. I told them the guys were just ahead. They said they are trying to catch them but didn't say why. 
After crossing US 76 it was a somewhat steep climb with a lot of log steps spread out. Going down the other side a young guy was trekking up the hill. After greeting each other he asked if I was coming from Maine. I said yes and asked where he was heading to. He said ""Maine."" I replied ""Cool."" I should have said ""Cold"" or ""Do you know what month it is??!!"" 
I've known of people starting in January and February. In 2012 while hiking the ECT I hit the AT the middle of March. December is a little early to start but it's his hike. 
The trail went up a mountain then down into a gap repeatedly. The sun almost looked like it would make an appearance at 3 p.m. but was shy. It seemed warmer and I even took off my vest for a bit. I saw a moth take flight off the ground. That was the only wildlife I'd see all day. At 4 p.m. it looked like rain but it would hold off all evening. 
Nearing the shelter I filled my two water bottles from water coming down a small cliff. A half hour later I got to the side trail to the Tray Mountain Shelter. It was 5:40. 
On the way back to the shelter I saw two guys camping out. I wondered why they didn't use the shelter since it's to rain later. I found the answer quickly. The shelter was full. 
Seven guys were at the shelter and it only sleeps seven. There was no room with them and all their gear. My heart sank. 
I haven't seen hardly any one and the shelters have been empty. Now the night of rain, freezing rain, sleet and snow in the forecast, the shelter is full. 
I set up about 50 feet in front of the shelter. I just wanted a spot that would drain well. Just after I got in my tent one of the guys invited me to stand by the fire but I declined. I wanted to get warm in my tent. The guys were friendly telling me where the water source was and asked about my Hubba NX tent. 
I was warm in the tent but wondered how much snow or freezing rain the frame would hold. I can only hope and pray for the best and remember in five days I'll be finished at Springer Mountain.","Blue Ridge Gap, GA

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605843,"Around 12:30 a.m. this morning I heard rain. I pulled items away from the sides of the tent as a precaution. If the sides of the tent touch the rain fly the tent gets wet. 
At 2:30 a.m. I heard a lot of talking at the shelter along with beams of headlamps going everywhere. I slowly unzipped my tent to look over. It looked like the guys were packing up. I looked over every few minutes and they were packing up. I started putting everything I could into my backpack because as soon as they were gone I was moving. 
They put on their packs to leave after 3 a.m. One guy had a string of blue lights wrapped around his pack. But as I watched only four left. 
I considered still moving over but I didn't want to disturb the other three guys. I heard one snoring. Plus I was toasty and dry in my tent. Back to sleep. 
At 8 a.m. I heard talking at the shelter. I got out and walked over. They said the four others left and told me to bring my gear over plus they were leaving too. They are all one group but the four that left at 3 wanted to get to the next shelter north before the heavy rains hit. 
I grabbed my already packed backpack out of my tent then placed it in the shelter. After pulling the six stakes out of the ground I just lifted my whole tent up and slid it into the shelter. It wasn't long before I was back inside the tent getting toasty again. 
The group is from Birmingham, Alabama. William is section hiking the AT and this was the only weekend the seven could get together to go with him. I got to tell them about Fireflo from Birmingham also. She sent me my new Mountainsmith Pack in 2012 after finishing the ECT. 
The two other guys with William were Dave and Adam. Adam gave me homemade beef jerky and some Jack Link's beef sticks. One of the other guys gave me a packet of chicken flavored ramen noodles. 
They finished packing and I thanked them. I told them that in 2012 hiking the ECT I rated Alabama as the friendliest state and it still is. They left around 10 a.m. 
At noon I no longer heard rain on the shelter's roof. I thought it was good timing for the Alabama group to be hiking when the rain slacked up. But I was wrong. When I looked out everything was white. The rain had changed to snow. 
I debated about going to the next shelter. I decided against that in case the snow changed back to the heavy rain forecast for today. Plus the winds picked up. I want to stay warm and dry one more night. 
I went for water twice. Once in the earlier rain and then in the afternoon in the snow. It was a quarter mile round trip each time. Other than that I napped. Today was a much needed rest for my body. 
As of 5 p.m. it is still snowing and the wind blowing. Tomorrow there is a winter storm warning for northern Georgia calling for snow, sleet and ice. If it continues to snow this dry snow at this elevation I think I'll be fine as long as it isn't too deep. Tomorrow I have 15.4 miles to go to Low Gap Shelter. Lord willing, I'll be finished hiking the AT in less than 100 hours.","Tray Mountain Shelter, GA

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605846,"The winds were monstrous overnight. I could hear branches cracking and falling. A big dead hemlock fell next to the shelter. The shelter was getting hit by objects. I was a bit nervous in the dark hearing those sounds. 
At daylight I could see that the trees were iced. No wonder they were breaking in the wind. Looks like an inch of ice. The ground had 2-3 inches of sleet and snow. 
I knew the risk of hiking today but I needed to go. I can only sit for so long. At 8 a.m. I started packing up. The shelter's floor was dusted with snow. My rainfly was frozen at the four bottom corners and the tent poles were frozen together. I was able to undo it all and get on the trail at 8:53. 
It was only a half mile to the top of Tray Mountain (4,430') from the shelter. Right away I knew I sas in trouble because it was hard walking in the snow and sleet uphill plus I was navigating around downed branches and bent over small trees. Then it got worse when I came to the Mountain Laurel filled summit. The Mountain Laurel was all bent down and too heavy to move. I ended up crawling underneath for a ways. At the small open summit I saw 2"" of ice on some of the stunted trees there. 
As I continued I began to worry. If the whole trail is like this it may delay everyone's finish. I might have to evacuate. I crawled through the Mountain Laurel for 20 minutes then realized I lost the trail. As the woodlands opened up I just kept near to the side of the descending ridge. Eventually I came to switchbacks and was glad when I saw a white blaze. 
I considered heading off the mountain. I saw a forestry road and considered it. But the trail seemed good at that point so I thought I'd follow it for a distance. 
I saw a parking area where a tree must have fallen right next to a parked vehicle. The main part of the tree missed the vehicle but the branches must have hit it. It looked like the owner of the vehicle had difficulty getting the vehicle out by the looks of the mud. I wonder if it was the Alabama group because they had a truck parked in this direction on a forestry road. 
The trail was good to follow. Now it was just snow. When I went up Rocky Mountain there was ice but nothing like Tray Mountain. 
About a mile before Unicoi Gap I saw hiker tracks. Someone came up that far then turned around. 
At the highway at the gap is a large parking area. Jeeps were playfully driving over the plowed snow. Families with kids were playing in the snow, one even making a snowman. Maybe this snow is rare in Georgia. 
Earlier today I had wished I hiked this section yesterday. It did not rain hard as predicted. Today I just wanted to get to Blue Mountain Shelter about 8 miles. I thought about going on today to Low Gap Shelter but due to the ice I thought I'd be tired. Plus if I went on it would be after dark and I didn't want to get stuck in Mountain Laurel and lose the trail. But after I crossed the highway I saw two sets of tracks. Maybe I could follow the tracks and not get off trail. I'd decide at the next shelter. 
Going up the Blue Mountain was slow due to the steepness and the snow. I saw all the wildlife I'd see all day on this section. I saw several mosquitoes and I saw a snail moving in one of the footprints. I moved the snail to leaves along a log out of the snow. 
The hike up Blue Mountain was long. This was the third 4,000' mountain I'd climb today. But it was not icy like Tray Mountain. It seemed to have less snow, too. 
I was going to decide at Blue Mountain Shelter whether to go on or not to Low Gap Shelter. Back in Franklin when I was planning out the last week Low Gap was where I wanted to reach today. 
When I got to the side trail to Blue Mountain Shelter my body must have been on autopilot because I just kept walking on the AT. I said out loud ""Well, I guess we're going to Low Gap."" It was 2:45. 
The trail was well graded and running pretty contour. I noticed there was only one inch of snow. I remember the trail was on an old road for a few miles from Low Gap when I hiked north before. I was real happy at 4:40 when I reached that road. It would be around four miles of easy hiking into Low Gap. I'm so glad I continued and did not stop at Blue Mountain! 
Some places the treadway of the trail was just slush. But later it actually became clear of any snow on and off. As the evening descended I filled up two water bottles at a small waterfall. When I'd stop for a short time I'd get cold otherwise I felt comfortable. I arrived at Low Gap Shelter side trail at 6:25. I was so grateful I continued! This puts me in good shape to finish Wednesday with three days averaging around 14 miles each. I have 42.6 to go. 
I went down the trail and found the shelter. It was dark and a bit foggy. I immediately got the tent up inside the shelter. I didn't want to get cold. 
Here at Low Gap in 1997 I ended my first attempt at thru hiking the AT. I became sick then and had to get off the trail. I was devastated I had failed at my dream. But I didn't give up and the next year I tried again and finished. How sweet that was. And in a few days I'll finish my fourth and final time hiking the AT. How sweet. How blessed.","Tray Mountain Shelter, GA

On the trail at 7:55. It was a long steady climb up Poor Mountain. The wet snow from yesterday had frozen overnight and hiking was tough. Going up the mountain it was 3-4 inches of snow. There were several miles of trees and branches on the trail due to the ice. I had to detour many times. 
At Hogpen Gap the highway was not plowed. A bulletin board there had a map. I thought if this road went to Neel Gap I'd follow it. But it did not. The shortest way was the trail. 
Just up the next hill was a side trail 1.2 miles to Whitley Gap Shelter. The dual hiker tracks I followed since Unicoi Gap yesterday went to the shelter but did not come out. They must be getting a late start as it was 11:30. 
The trail had more trees down at first but then it was decent. My tracks now were the only ones. 
At Tesnatee Gap I saw tracks going south. Some hikers must have slacked packed from there. Not too bad a hike up the hill but somehow I got turned around in a maze of icy Witch Hazel bushes and returned all the way back down to Tesnatee Gap wasting half an hour. I even saw my own tracks. I thought they looked like Merrells treads. When it occurred to me they were mine I was almost at the gap. On the way back up a few pieces of ice hit me on the head and I said ""Maybe that will knock some sense into you."" 
All the 5.5 miles to Neel Gap was ups and downs but nothing difficult. At 2 p.m. it started to snow. I was soaked from all the melting ice and snow dripping off the trees all day. I passed a day hiker going north testing out his new equipment. 
Due to my mistake earlier today I thought I'd reach Neel Gap about 5 p.m. but was surprised and glad I got there at 4:07. I didn't stop at the outfitters there because I wanted to get to the next shelter before dark. The outfitters was decorated for Christmas and looked nice in the falling snow. 
I crossed the highway and headed up Blood Mountain. It started to get breezy. Most of the day the wind was calm. 
I came to the side trail to the shelter about 6. Then it was .4 back down the side trail to the shelter. No one was there. 
I got my tent up and hung up my wet gear. Despite having rain gear practically everything was wet except my sleeping bag, tent and clothes under my jacket. I was cold.

I decided to put my stove in the tent since it was so cold. The stove is a small reservoir I pour the fuel in then I place the top on. There are holes all around the top like a gas stove. The reservoir sits in a round tray that I pour fuel in also. When I light it the heat warms the reservoir fuel so that it evaporates and comes out of the holes. That is what feeds the flame. It took a lot of fuel to get the evaporation and even then I drank lukewarm coffee. Several times in the past I got the temperature in the tent up to 90. Today only 20 degrees. It was cold out! The winds started overnight. 
I reached out of my tent and found my shoes frozen. When I got up to get all my gear hanging to dry all was frozen. I put my damp fleece jacket on and the frozen rain jacket over it. I put convertible pants on then slid the frozen rain pants over them. I put a bagel bag on each sock then pressed hard to get my feet into the boots. I did not want to get going but I knew I had to. 
I got packed then headed the .4 up the hill to the AT in the dark using my headlamp. The backpack felt like a frozen board against my back. It was windy so I kept my head down and away from the wind. I was sincerely worried about frostbite since I was wet and it was so cold. I thought about Hash getting frostbite a few weeks ago. I thought about the book ""To Build a Fire."" 
When I reached the AT at the ridge the horizon was orange. It was 6:39. The sky was clear and I knew it was to be sunny. I wanted the sun to hit me and warm me up. 
About 20 minutes into the hike the sun came up and the trail veered away from the wind. About an hour into the hike I was warm enough to take the poncho off. I was feeling better and warmer. 
The first climb took me up again into ice covered trees. Looked like some had 2 inches on them. Some branches on the trail but nothing terrible. Then the trail dropped and the snow depth lessened. 
At Woods Gap there were trash cans but it was too windy to stop so I continued across the highway. I warmed up enough to take my rain jacket off. 
About a mile later I met Tanner and his girlfriend Taylor. They were hiking the Georgia Loop. They were heading back to their vehicle because it was so cold last night. They met Toots and SOS at a shelter last night. He said everyone was so cold. Toots and SOS are finishing the trail today. Tanner said up ahead there is no snow nor wind. They congratulated me which reminded me again how close I was to finishing and I felt teary eyed. 
I continued on the trail and the snow disappeared as the trail dropped. I went through a beautiful forest of Holly trees. It became warm enough I didn't even need a jacket. No snow anywhere and it was warm. It felt so good. 
When I left today I did not know how far I'd get with the snow. I needed to do 14. The next shelters were at 11 miles or 19. When the trail became good I decided to push to the 19 miles. 
Going up Justus Mountain I ran into snow again but no ice. I put my jacket and gloves back on. When I dropped down into Hightower Gap there were military vehicles there and some soldiers. The national forest is used by the military for training maneuvers. 
I went up the next hill getting water along the way. I came to Hawk Mountain Shelter at about 5:40. I was so pleased I made it. 
After I had my tent set up in the shelter I looked out to see a waxing crescent moon. Such a beautiful ending after a mixture of struggles and emotions today.

I am not young but I am not the preferred age for a knee replacement. Even if I had the knee replaced it would not change my decision. I just got 2,000 miles out of the bad one and am ending on a high note. Can't wait to tell the doctor. 
A hiker came in late last night. He was 37 year old Hot Dam from North Carolina. We talked some while he made his dinner. He said he wants to be on the trail at 8 a.m. to finish. 
It was cold all night almost as cold as last night. I was in no hurry and did not want to disturb Hot Dam so I waited until 8 then started moving. I got my coffee then started to pack up. Hot Dam said ""I guess I won't be on the trail at 8!"" 
I headed to the trail at 9:45. Unknown to us Mantis camped nearby in his hammock. I said hello and told him I'll see him up the trail. 
It was cold out but I warmed up fast. The trail was good with a few blotches of snow. 
Mantis caught up to me quick. We congratulated each other. He's probably about 18 years old. I told him I was proud of him and anyone who stuck to completing the trail as most quit. He said he was meeting his dad today. I wished him well. A minute later he disappeared over a hill. I felt a bit sad knowing I'll never see him or any of the other hikers I've come to know on the trail. 
I came to Long Creek Falls and went back to see it. Beautiful. I camped here in 2012 coming in on the Benton MacKaye Trail while doing the ECT. 
Hot Dam came in as I was going out. He caught up again and we congratulated each other then hit fists, the thru hiker handshake. Then he disappeared in the distance. 
The trail was on an old road now following several creeks through rhododendron thickets and pines. 
I was taking my time planning on finishing at sunset but as the trail climbed up Stover Creek and Davis Creek I saw more and more snow. It became breezy and colder. The sun did not come out fully today but was lingering behind thin clouds. I did not want to be cold and it was becoming apparent that there might not be a sunset. I had too much time on my hands so I decided to just push it to Springer Mountain. 
I crossed a forestry road and had just .9 to go. The trail was packed down and icy due to heavy use. Not too far in, the trail became littered with ice that fell off the trees. The hiking was slow and cold. 
The summit, at 3,782', was in the trees with a vista looking west. No one was around. Snow had been brushed off the bronze plaque marking the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. At 2:30 p.m. I stood at the plaque finishing my 4th and final AT hike. I knelt and gave thanks. 
I was cold and tired. This was a tough hike especially the last two weeks or so. I felt no emotions as in the past. I think I was simply exhausted. 
I left the summit following the blue blazed access trail to Amicalola State Park. I was heading to the shelter two miles away. The trail was not as compacted as the last section of the AT from the forestry road but was covered with broken ice that had fallen off the trees. It was difficult walking. 
When I arrived at the shelter I was still in the snow so I continued. I was done with the snow and ice. I saw a campsite was listed in the book in two miles. But that campsite turned out to be on a snowy cold mountain top so on I went. 
The trail still was covered in broken ice five miles from Springer. Fallen branches caused short detours. At one point I thrust my trekking poles into the ground and stopped with my head down. 
After a race sometimes the runner collapses. He programmed his body and mind to just get to the finish line. Then he collapsed. The fatigue caught up to him. I made it to the finish line. Perhaps the fatigue is catching up. 
Just after 5 p.m. the trail dropped in elevation and the snow and ice disappeared. I had water for tonight but wanted more for coffee in the morning. I kept going and going. About 6 p.m. I ordered a halt. I saw a campsite and stopped. 
The horizon to the west had some orange colors but not brilliant though I was happy to see it. It was a calm beautiful last night in the woods. 
After I got in my last set up tent for this journey I heard a Barred Owl. I've heard them frequently along the hike but not for awhile. How appropriate to hear one on my last night out. 
I also heard coyotes at distance. And I can hear the sound of a highway a few miles away. Civilization awaits me. It will pounce on me in the morning. 
Sweet peace and thank you to all. Now the tears flow. I am so blessed.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605910,"(12/13) Before sunrise I started to pack up for the last time. It didn't seem too cold today. Since I didn't find water last night I made coffee using the remaining punch I had in my one water bottle. It wasn't too bad. After that I refilled the stove a few times to burn the remainder of fuel I had. I watched the last of the fuel burn out with mixed emotion then finished packing up. I don't remember what time it was and I guess it didn't matter anyway, the journey is over. Its over, Lake.
I hiked the two miles to the Amicalola Lodge trying not to dream about breakfast in case it was closed. But it was open and I was glad. I had a choice of a cold breakfast or a warm breakfast. Of course I chose the warm breakfast. The service was great but as in the past the food was mediocre. But I didn't care, it was warm food. The view out the large windows to the south and southwest was outstanding. The mountains of Georgia are beautiful.They tugged at my heart.
I left the lodge and headed to Amicalola Falls and the steps.The falls is the highest east of the Mississippi River and that equals 600+ steps going down the beautiful falls. At the bottom is a paved path perhaps a quarter mile long leading to a pond. Along that stretch I left my boots that I wore from Dry Tortugus Island near Key West, Florida all the way up to Amicalola Falls State Park while doing the Eastern Continental Trail in 2012. I had hoped to locate them today but nothing looked familiar and I was too tired for an extended search. I tried one ledge but nothing found. Perhaps its for the better that they remain in their final state of rest.
At the park visitors center a female ranger had me sign the AT log book then offered a free soda or ice cream. I asked where the showers were and she directed me up the way I just came to a bath house. At the bath house I saw myself in the mirror; skinny and ragged. After the shower I went down to the park office visitors and bought a few things and a free Coke. I thanked the two people in there and went outside.
 A few weeks ago I emailed Ron Brown of Appalachian Trail Shuttle and he was to pick me up at noon. We emailed back and forth the whole time so that he knew my progress and he encouraged me along. At noon he arrived and took me to Dahlonega in his Pathfinder with 500,000 miles on it. A very pleasant guy to talk to. He dropped me off in town where everything I needed was in a short walking distance. I thanked him and will see him tomorrow.
I did laundry, then went to North Georgia Hair Cutters. I told the girl I need an emergency haircut. Vikki said ""...an emergency hair cut it will be."" I think she took off 10 pounds of hair. Not much left. Turns out her relatives live 20 miles from me in Pennsylvania.
Afterwards I went to Dollar General, Rite Aid then to Dahlonega Mountain Inn. Within site was McDonald so I bought dinner there and later purchased two freezer burned pints of ice cream at a store down the street. Then I was in my room all night.
(12/14) Ron picked me up at 11am and took me to Atlanta. Before 1pm he dropped me off at the Howard Johnson Wyndham hotel. I really appreciated his help and great conversation on the ride down. He headed out to shuttle some folks up in Tennessee. It was raining all day and check in wasn't until 3pm unless you paid an extra $30. But at 2pm the manager allowed all of us sitting there inthe lobby to check in due to the rain.
I don't quite have asthma but almost do according to some tests I had last year.When I entered my room I thought I was going to have a breathing problem. Whoever was there before me had super strong cologne. I haven't had any issues for a few years but thought I was about to. I looked out the window from my 5th floor room and saw a McDonalds a block away. Nothing else around except hotels and apartments. I didn't want to switch rooms so I decided to turn the fans on and go get something to eat. The bathroom fan didnt work so only the heater/cooler fan hopefully would help.
It was raining hard when I left the hotel. Worst was the six lane streets and the walk signals. I stood at the intersection for a long time waiting for the walk light going over and back. I noticed the sound of the trucks and cars going by seemed amplified with the wet road. Back at the hotel I was soaked but I had no further excursions for the evening. I settled in for a relaxing night.
Today, 12/15, I was up at 4am to pack and make sure all was right for the TSA at the airport. I took the hotel shuttle to the airport. But at the airport I was so lost for awhile. Not where to go but what to do. As I stood in a line watching peoples' movements I discovered the long line I was in was to give the airline my luggage. First I had to go to an automated kiosk and pay for my backpack then to print out my ticket. My card would not work at first but going to another station all was well. Then back into the long line. An airport employee said we could check our luggage outside. Few went but I did and my pack was quickly taken and sent on my way. The guy said I need to go to Gate A-5. 
What a trip on escalators up and down and a subway shuttle. Then at gate A-5 it said New York. I ask a Delta person at a desk if that was where I was to go and she said yes. I said its say New York but she said it will change. I asked some people if the were going to Fort Myers and they said New York. They suggested I checked the board listing the flights. I did and the gate was changed. I got there just as they were starting to load. When I got on finally I really got the next to last seating location. I was in the last row and in seat E.
Less than two hours later I was in Fort Myers, my backpack was waiting, and Heartrock picked me up immediately. We went to Dunkin Donuts for an emergency coffee then to her condo. She had made spaghetti and meatballs for me because a few days back I told her I craved it. We talked, took Brody fora walk, then she had to go to a wedding. I wasn't invited but that was good because the return to civilization overwhelmed my little brain for the day. Sitting through a wedding and the socialization later was out of the question. 
As I soaked in the tub looking at the fancy Italian tile all around (put in by previous owner) I so missed the simplicity of the trail and the camaraderie of all those I met on the trail. I thought I do not know where I belong. Civilization is so loud, busy and artificial. ""...But we decide which is right and which is an illusion?""",,View Entry,"Dec 15, Sat",0
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605960,"It has already been a week since I finished! Time slips by so remarkably fast.As I review my hike this year I conclude it was one tough hike. There was the difficulty of hiking southbound starting out with all the rugged terrain before developing hiker legs. Lots of humidity and heat caused me to feel sluggish. The giardia certainly took a toll on the body and the mind. A corn on my toe was more painful than my eroding knee and would plague me the entire journey. In the South the unusual cold weather along with the ice storms placed a damper on my last weeks of hiking. I also think the shortening of the daylight definitely took some enjoyment out of the journey. Usually during warmer and longer days I enjoy sitting outside the tent soothing my mind by viewing the wild surroundings. Hiking more often in the morning or evening darkness was not my favorite thing although it sometimes was a unique adventure. All that was part of the successful journal. Now I look back at all the difficulties and smile.I think my most enjoyable thru hike on the AT was in 2008. Weather-wise it was a beautiful hiking season. My 2012 AT hike was my second favorite. It was the central part of the Eastern Continental Trail thru hike. Weather was also very favorable that year. This year would be my third favorite. 1998 was my first thru hike and would rank as my forth favorite but that doesn’t mean it was bad. It was a very wet year and I carried too much weight. I remember my sleeping bag was seven pounds!I carefully would not recommend a southbound hike to anyone. Unless that is the only timeline one could thru hike the AT I would strongly suggest a northbound thru hike overwhelmingly. Northbound starts with Spring. If there is a cold day there is always hope of warmer days to come. The excitement of all the Nobos with their energy, hopes and dreams blossoms into the sweet camaraderie. The longer days allows prolonged enjoyment of the mornings and evenings.One of the things that tugged my heart during this hike was when I was walking through Georgia. I’d remember those times I headed north from Springer Mountain carrying a dream. It was such a time as we'd envisage a season of hope and excitement. No one knew what would be ahead for us but we all shared the hope and anticipation of a great life changing adventure.As I sit here drinking coffee and eating anything but peanut butter and Spam I must admit I miss the trail no matter what the conditions…to a certain degree. I miss the smells, the vistas, the mountains and the people. I miss the moon and sun rising and setting. I miss the thru hikers, weekend hikers, day hikers and all those that emailed me, called me, or followed along on Trailjournals. Incidentally, I am surprised and blessed at all the comments, congratulations, and well wishes sent via my Trailjournal guest book. Thank you everyone.I love the Appalachian mountains. I love the Appalachian people. I love the Appalachian Trail. The Appalachian Trail Thru hike…forever in my heart.",,View Entry,"Dec 19, Wed",0
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606025,"Prior to 2008 all I wanted to do someday was hike the Appalachian Trail a second time. That desire was fulfilled in 2008. Never in my wilds dreams did I plan or expect to hike the Pacific Coast Trail from Mexico northward and into British Columbia. That was a success in 2009. I had no desire to hike the Continental Divide Trail with its grizzlies and bushwhacking. Then that moment in December 2009 while carrying firewood in the snow up the hill to my house something changed my mind and I was at peace with it. Prior to heading out on the CDT, in the Spring of 2010 I went with a group to Vanuatu on a missions trip hiking into the jungle seeing a spectacular paradise and beautiful loving people. Later that year I finished the CDT. I thought what John Brinda hiked in 1997 and what Nimblewill Nomad hiked in 1998, both from from Florida into Canada, was the greatest hike ever. Even now I don’t understand how I was able to hike the Eastern Continental Trail in 2011-12 and was successful. Trying to hike across the USA was a mix of successes, failures, and fallures (fallure is when one gives it 100% yet does not succeed). But I had a good hike from Battery Park, New York City, into Ohio. Then a similar good hike across Oregon to Riggins, Idaho (perhaps some year I can connect those hikes via a bicycle). This year’s hike on the AT is the conclusion of 10 years of remarkable adventure.Tomorrow I’ll return to my home in Pennsylvania and that is when and where I’ll realize the journeys are complete. It could be a rough road. I’m sure there will be some great desires to return to the trails but I plan to stay in place. My plans are to continue to work on trails as a volunteer at Worlds End State Park. A new trail is planned from the northern terminus of the Loyalsock Trail eastward to Ricketts Glen State Park and I hope to be an instrumental part with the construction of that trail. A few minor trails are planned in the area pending approval. I think I could be busy doing trail work for years as long as there is no interference.When I am home and out hiking this weekend I will conclude the 10 years of adventure and finish this journal. I never like endings because they do come too fast and they pass too slow. But, as one season ends another begins.",,View Entry,"Dec 26, Wed",0
Lake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606169,"I wish I was on the other side of the dream, back when it all began, now almost 11 years ago. It was a sweet, simple dream. I've seen so many grand sights and met so many wonderful people. Sometimes I flew like an eagle and sometimes I was deep in despair.
Well, this year is almost over and so is my season of adventure. One too many hikes down the narrow trail of time. I just don't know what to write. I do but it would be too mushy. Maybe I'll slip in some lyrics from songs and nobody will notice.
Great thanks and sweet peace to all of you. Someday in the mist of time if someone asks you if you knew me please smile and say you were a friend of mine then this sadness would be lifted from my eyes.

Adventure 

(Wednesday 9/03/08, 5:53pm at Cloud Pond, ME) 
 You are
adventure. Adventure is Your name, my Lord. You created and told
Adam to subdue the land, to search and explore. You created
adventure for Yourself. Creating the universe, creating the heavens,
creating the earth. You gave us the desire to seek, to explore, and
to conquer. We are created in Your image. We, mankind, are
adventurers like You, our creator. If only we’d venture after You. I’ve seen lavish lake, magnificent mountains, roaring rivers, and
spectacular starscapes. I marvel at them all. Let my greatest
adventure be seeking YOU, the creator of all, the adventure author. You are my quest. You are my adventure!
Because 

(Tuesday 8/19/08 at Gorham, NH)
 Because of You
I was created. Because of You I live. Because of You I share
eternity. But why? Who am I? A sinful pitiful man. Why do You
bless me? Why do I sit here many miles from home having journeyed so
safe? Because You love me? Yes! Because You love me. “I want to
know what love is” was my cry. You are love. I am not alone. You
have been by my side always. Though I slumber in my daily human
habits, You have waited, watched and guarded faithfully. Hold me
Jesus. Hold me Jesus, just for a while. I’ve seen millions of
flowers and stars. I’ve seen the mountains and the rivers. I’ve
seen the midnight moon. I’ve seen so much as I vainly travel
along. Now I want to see You.
Compassion
(Thursday
8/21/08, Carlo Col Shelter, celebrating first day in Maine)
 Your compassion
never fails. You see the sparrow fall. You’ve seen the lost axe in
the river. You’ve seen the hungry faithful widow. Who am I that I
have favor with you? Who am I to shower in Your compassion so
freely? So easy for You to blot out this worthless soul. But Your
loving kindness can not be measured. Love that can’t be
understood. Broken, beaten, spiked, You were silent. We didn’t
understand. You forgave Your murderers. Incomprehensible
compassion. No prejudice to any soul. Compassion free to all. To
all free compassion. Just for me to say “My Lord” to accept. Compassion equals undeserved love. 
Dreams


(Thursday
8/21/08, Carlo Col Shelter, celebrating first day in Maine)
My hopes and my
dreams, I give to You. I want to know the hopes and dreams You have
for me. To please You is my hope. To know You is my dream. Inspire
my night dreams with your magnificent mysteries. Challenge my
daydreams with Your divide desires. I dream of running across the
galaxies, jumping on the cosmic mountains You have created, hand in
hand with my Lord. I dream of dancing on Saturn rings, praising You
and Your creativity. Jump from the Rockies to the Appalachians in one
stride, You next to me as We laugh in Holy innocent joy. Dream. Only
dreamers have dreams that come true.
Endings
(Friday
8/22/08 at Old Speck Mountain)
 Endings come
too fast and they pass too slow. Oh, my heart aches. My flesh is
weary, so tired. So far have I traveled. Great climbs, great drops. Rock over rock over rock. Yet I don’t want it to end. As my body
withers, I know it must end. My spirit will be broken, but a broken
spirit is an acceptable offering to You, my Lord. The journey is
hard. The reward? Seeing Your creativity. Hearing the waterfalls
applaud You. Listening to the trail bird’s (Thrush) nightly solo
filled with Your praise. 
 The trail will
end. The solitude will end. This mission will end. One day this life
will end. Like a seed in autumn, it withers, dies, and falls to the
ground. Then new life begins. A new trail? A new adventure? An
eternity with You? Yet my heart is so twisted. If not for the joy
we had, would I not be so sorrowful for its ending? Because of Your
goodness, because of what You’ve done for me, I’m sad to see it
completed. However, an ending is a beginning of something new. What
do You have planned, my Lord? 
Forever!

thank You! How blessed I am to be here right now. Your creativity
goes on forever! I will sing with You forever, laugh with You

this pond, and ponder Your creativity on this fading earth, I know I
will one day explore the universe with You. You are my Friend forever

You would allow me to sit at this moment, on this mountain, viewing
countless mountains in Your desired formation in front of me? Hundreds of miles of Your creativity sit before me that I have
trekked through. But how little my steps are to this great stretch of
beauty before me. I can see back to Mount Washington in New
Hampshire, perhaps over 100 trail miles between us. Who am I that
You’ve blessed me to see so much of Your creativity in this season? Yet what I have seen is just a small taste of what You have ahead of
me in this life and life yet to come. I’ve seen You in the
mountains, the rivers, and the stars. You’ve left Your mark for man
to recognize You. You are no secret. I see You. I know You. I
love you. I am nothing without You. And only by Your magnificent

everything I dream let it be for You.

before or ever to come You will rule with perfect righteousness and
judgment. Only a fool would walk astray. Only a fool would walk in
disobedience. Once Your awesome terrible power is displayed who can
not know! Who couldn’t believe that You are the promised King! Nature will rejoice in glorious beauty. The waters will applaud. The clouds will dance in distant displays. Your children will
rejoice. Who are You? The King! The King! THE KING! This is Your
day, the Day of the King.

Long? (A longing to see Jesus)

With
Your arms of love I’ll be lifted from Your feet
As
You radiance evaporates my pool of tears away
How
long, Jesus, ‘til I see the One who gave life to me
How
long, Jesus, ‘til I thank the Son who came to set me free
How
long, Jesus, ‘til I kiss the Man crushed at Gethsemane
How
long, Jesus, ‘til I worship the Lamb slain on Calvary
‘Til
I gaze upon the risen One, behold the face of the glorified Son
How
long, Jesus, ‘til I see the One who gave life to me
My
renewed hands will play Your music perfectly
With
an angelic voice Your praise forever will I sing
And
youthful strength dance to the Ancient of Days
Then
I’ll stand in awe at the presence of my King
How
long, Jesus, ‘til I see the One who gave life to me
How
long, Jesus, ‘til I thank the Son who came to set me free
How
long, Jesus, ‘til I kiss the Man crushed at Gethsemane
How
long, Jesus, ‘til I worship the Lamb slain on Calvary

I gaze upon the risen One, behold the face of the glorified Son

Memory
(9/10/2008

Keep my memory
fresh, my Lord. Erase all that is displeasing to You. Let my memories
be of the greatness I have seen of Your creativity. May my memories
please You! Forget the petty things of old. Forget the lingering
grudges. Only memories of Your joy and love let shine. Onward to new
memories to please You!
The old past is
over, rotted, forgotten. Hurt and destroyed dreams are gone forever.
Only memories of good, of Your goodness let flourish. You and the joy
of your goodness help me to carry on. Let the dreams in the night
glorify You. The memories that display let them bring a smile to You.
Let’s create more and let them be pure. Hoping to please only You
until I’m home forevermore.
Near
(9/10/08,
10:45am at Rainbow Lake Dam)
 Draw me near,
my God. I am near the waters of this lake, but not in. How near can I
get to You my Lord? The closer I get, the further it seems. You are
in me but am I in You? I want to be so near I can hear Your whisper.
I see Katahdin, so near, so beautiful, yet 30 miles away. I want to
climb nearer. I will be at the summit in 48 hours touching what I
have longed for. I want to be that close to You. So near that I can
touch You. 
 I’ll take a
rock from the summit so I’ll always have a piece of Katahdin. But I
don’t want just a piece of You! I don’t want to own You. Who
can? I want You to claim me. Not just a piece of me, but all of me. All the territories of this body, mind and spirit. For if I don’t
relinquish all I have, then I don’t have You at all. Lay claim to
this wasteland. For only You can make it new. Claim me! Place Your
flag on my heart and conquer. I am Your territory. Let no evil tread
on me. You are always near. So near that You will chase away the evil
from this child of Yours.
 Pray I stay
near as You stay faithfully near to me. Oh! Draw me near.

hand as it reaches down to lowly man, waiting to be grasped. Open is
Your heart, to love and be loved. Eternal Life; an open gift to any
who care to accept.
Peace and love, open
to those in need. Fathership and sonship, endless adventures and
futures unfathomable, open to all inclined to desire. 
 The way to the
Father opened by the sacrifices of Jesus. Opened! No more veil. Just
open our hearts to Him and He’ll open our eyes and ears. Our being
will at last be open to Him and all He plans for us. Open the door
and step into His chamber…forever and ever. Amen. 
Peace

 As I sit on
this large rock jutted into the lake, I am nearly surrounded by
water. Lovely and peaceful is the water and solid is the rock I sit
on. With You, Great God, creator of this rock, as well as everything
I see, I am surrounded on all sides by You. How lovely You are. How
peaceful You are. How solid a rock You are, one that won’t be
moved. I sit in the palm of Your hand, nothing to be afraid of. You
were my Protector in days past, You are my Protector this day, and in
the days to come, You will be my Protector. I have nothing to fear
for You have granted me perfect peace. 
 When the dirty
waters of this world are splashing against me, with You, the Solid
Rock, I am skirted in, at peace. When the violent winds of this world
attempt to scatter me, with You, the solid Rock, I am shielded
behind, at peace. When the driving rains want to wash my hopes and
dreams away, because of You, I stand firm on the solid foundation, at
peace. Yahshua, the Solid Rock. Perfect peace by the Prince of
Peace.
Quiet
(Written
9/10/08 at Rainbow Lake Dam remembering
 the
dusk of Wednesday, 9/03/08, at Cloud Pond, ME)
 Some nights are
so quiet all I can hear is my heartbeat. Not a creature, a wave, nor
a wind. Just my heartbeat. All else is quiet. So quiet. I listen for
You in the quiet. Are You speaking to me? I look for You in the
stillness. Where are You? I cry to You in the developing darkness.
Can You hear me?
 Then I see a
half moon, then a planet, then a galaxy. You are speaking, You are
here, and You listen even when all is at quiet. So quiet. 
 On the still
water a Loon summons its mate in the night, a beautiful sound. A
hidden Barred owl calls from the dark lakeshore. What are they
saying?
 As I listen to
their cries in the quiet, I distinctly hear them. I know, as I cry
out in the quiet, You hear me. Is my cry as beautiful to Your ears as
the Loon is to mine? To me, the Barred owl is unseen as he calls. Do
You see me? Let my cries in the night be as pleasing to You as the
Loon and the Barred owl are to me. 
 I’m a voice in
the quiet calling You. Listening to only You and my heartbeat. So
quiet.
Run
(Saturday
9/6/08 at Antler’s Campsite on Lower Jo-Mary Lake)
I run to You Jesus!
With Joy I run to You. I’m prepared not to only run to You but to
wherever You send me. Not a sprint but an ultra run for You. To
endure the pain, the heartache, the hunger, the discomfort to reach
the goal for You. With all my strength and determination to run to
that finish line that You have set before me. To run as if it makes a
difference because it does make a difference. You indeed have
commissioned the race and pointed me to the finish line. Run! Help me
to run and to stay in the race! No crown, no prize, just Your words
“Well done good and faithful servant.” Only then shall I rest. 
Sweet
(9/10/08
at Rainbow Lake Dam)
How
sweet You are my Lord
Only
Your children know the taste
As
sugar is sweet to our tongues
You
are sweet to our hearts
Men
try all to please their souls
Travel,
buildings, land, sin
But
nothing can satisfy the heart’s desire
Except
the sweetness of Jesus
Only
He can satisfy the heart
Soothing
the soul with His love
Satisfying
the hungry heart
Like
a hot breakfast to a hungry hiker
Sweeter
than honey
Sweeter
than chocolate
Nothing
satisfies
Like
the sweetness of Sweet Jesus
Today
(9/10/08
at Rainbow Lake Dam)
 “Where do I
go to today, my Lord?” I ask as I wander along each day, heading
north. Where do I go? Where do I stop? And You show me. I see
beauty beyond measure. Places I only dream of. How can I thank you?
 No more todays
about me. Today belongs to you. How can I serve You? How can I serve
you better?
 You have blessed
me today with this majestic view of my destination. This morning I
asked where shall I go today and You led me here! A campsite with a
view of Katahdin!
Why? You have
blessed me so! How can I ever bless You?
I
praise You for today!
I
worship You today!
Everyday
is a gift.
No
wasted todays anymore my Lord!
Today
belongs to You! Where shall I go?
Upstream
(9/10/08
at Rainbow Lake Dam)
 Find me in the
river, the river Jesus. Many are there, refreshing in Your waters. But I
want more. I want to
swim upstream to Your river’s source…YOU. To let all behind and
head upstream, refreshing this old soul in Your waters as I climb and
climb. Upstream to You, the source. Never to be contented where I am
in the river, but to search and explore the spiritual frontiers that
are Yours. Pools to cleanse and immerse in. Eddies to relax and
refresh in. Upstream to You.
 “Follow me”
I yell to others I observe stationary as they refresh in the river.
“I’m going upstream closer to the source, Jesus.” 
 “But this is
beautiful right here in the river Jesus” some say. 
 “Yes,
indeed!” I reply. “But how much sweeter and beautiful it is at
the source! We must pursue the river upstream to where it all began,
the spring of living water, Jesus.
 Upstream
against complacency.
 Upstream
against the norm.
 Upstream
against flesh’s wisdom.
 Upstream to the
source, Jesus.
Value
(9/10/08
possibly at Rainbow Lake Dam)
 Your creativity
is so beautiful! I value what You have done. Value is worth. What is
the value of all I’ve seen? Priceless.
 Eyes to see
Your creativity. Ears to hear Your wind and water. A nose to smell
the fragrance of the flowers. What value is all this that You have
given to us? Beyond measure. 
 You value
mankind so much as to come and die for us, puny man. But why? What
is the value of Your salvation? Unfathomable. So magnificent and
mysterious is Your love that no man can comprehend.
 I hold all I’ve
seen up to You in thanksgiving. I value all that You have done. You
died for me! No value to my family but You died for lowly me! I am
valuable to You! You are priceless to me.
Wilderness
(9/02/08
sitting along Little Wilson Creek after hiking down from 
Little
Wilson Falls. First day in Maine’s “100 Mile Wilderness”) 
 The “100 mile
wilderness!” Yes! Here I am, my first night! Alone, disturbed in
spirit. Delivered a message from You to a stranger. A bit chilly as I
sit here on the slippery slate. Oh! Open my eyes to see! Open my ears
to hear! Open my heart to receive! What is it that You, my God, have
so long awaited me to partake of? What is it that has taken decades
to complete? Where will You send me?
 The first night
here in the wilderness. So many mixed emotions. Alone, afraid, weary,
excited, broken, grateful. The sound of the waterfall applauds You!
The stream before me applauds You! The lush forest that surrounds me
is but a minute expression of its original glory and of its future
glory. I am like that. I want to explode in the glory of my God. Like
nature, I moan in waiting. But I wait. My time in the holy wilderness
is dwindling. The warrior within is in waiting. I wait to hear the
cry of my Conqueror Jesus echo across the wilderness His commands for
me. His orders will be served, the mission understood, and the
wilderness I will leave. The assignment will commence… 
eXtravagant
(from
home, in gratitude for His providence)
 Your providence
has been extravagant! Against the odds You have permitted me to trek
so far and yet return home so safe. My Appalachian venture was not
as a prodigal son but as an exploring disciple, seeking You and
seeking You early when it is written that I will find You. 
 The
extravagance of your artistry was on display wherever my eyes chose
to glance. During the lonely first nights when I questioned my
decision, You cloaked me with Your extravagant peace. On frosty
hilltops I was charmed by the extravagant displays You presented in
the heavens. Within the wilds I journeyed and slept safely because of
Your extravagant protection. As the distance and the days shortened,
Your extravagant attentiveness to this weary soul preserved me. 
 Who am I to
see and soak in all You have created? You have granted my heart’s
desires. Though my heart twisted with many stirring memories and
emotions and the tears wrung out, You gently eased my heart’s pains
and allowed me to understand what I was experiencing: Extravagant
love, only given by an extravagant God, You. Oh, let this
warrior-in-waiting give birth to an extravagant devotion to You. 
 Oh, beautiful
Father, how can I thank You for Your extravagant providence? How?
You
(9/02/08
sitting along Little Wilson Creek after hiking down from 
Little
Wilson Falls. First day in Maine’s “100 Mile Wilderness”) 
 It’s all
about You. The winds are blowing all around me. You sent them. The
waters of the creek in front of me are rushing by. You rained on the
headwaters. The clouds, dark and light, grey and blue pass high above
me. You told them to race across the sky. The shapes of the
mountains I see at a distance were created by your fingers. Art that
can’t be copied. The Goldenrod and the Asters dance to You in the
wind. Their shapes so intricate only You could imagine. Trees so
similar but each so different-white birch, red pine, white spruce-
all stretching towards the sky. Who could design them? Only You. And
me, so puny and weak yet so complex. Only You could imagine and bring
to pass a man. 
 Then You. Who
could know You? Who could understand? Nothing withholds You. Not
time, not space, and certainly not me. Everything was created by You
for You. It’s all about You.
Zeal
(9/02/08
sitting along Little Wilson Creek after hiking down from 
Little
Wilson Falls. First day in Maine’s “100 Mile Wilderness”) 
 Give me Your
zeal God! Zeal to change people, places, and palaces. Zeal to live
for You. Zeal to clean out Your house. Zeal to clean out my house. Help my faith be strong. Erase any disbelief. Let me look only to
You! Let me forgive any fallen pillars. Let me forgive any self
appointed leaders. It’s not about me. It’s not about them. It’s
about You. 
 Give me zeal to
seek only You. Give me zeal to worship only You. Give me zeal to
listen to only You. Zeal to complete obediently and perfectly the
will of God my Father all the days of my life.
 I have zeal to
run and zeal to hike. I only want zeal for the things of You. 
Zeal
to live for You.
 Zeal to honor You.
Zeal
to die for You.",,View Entry,"May 26, Wed",0
