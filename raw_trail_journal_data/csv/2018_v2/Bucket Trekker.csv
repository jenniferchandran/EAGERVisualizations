Bucket Trekker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587610,"A mixture of excitement and trepidation. On earth just over fifty years, and for more than thirty of those I’ve had a perhaps romantic thought of hiking the Appalachian Trail.  Some background on me to start with.    I work hard… a work ethic learned of farm life and growing up in a time when my parents experienced job loss and even bankruptcy… they didn’t complain if I bought my own school lunch ticket, jeans, shoes….  I wouldn’t change those experiences for anything as they’ve made me resilient in ways that are at once obvious and difficult to describe.  I am dedicated to my family… with four young kids (elementary and middle school) involved in piano lessons, scouts, soccer, orchestra, science Olympiad, and guitar lessons, my wife and I are continually on the go.  I like to think I’m an involved and engaged dad, doing my share of the diaper changing as it were.  Probably not doing enough of the cooking, but breakfasts and getting the kids ready for school is my watch.  And certainly am aware that as a college educated Caucasian male in twenty-first century middle America, with a stable job, house, healthy and intelligent kids, a hard-working and organized wife, and all the advantages and options those things give me, that I’m one of the most fortunate humans ever put on this earth.  Add to that the fortune of marrying a fiery woman from Puerto Rico… beautiful, tough-minded, passionate, and dedicated to her children. Well respected in her job.  Intelligent. And like any Latina in this county needs more than one hand to count the large and small discriminations of gender, ethnicity, and other assumptions about her.  We walk through this life together, and experience it differently every day.  It’s my fortune to get to experience the world through her eyes.    None of this is to brag.  But the wealthy man must sometimes count his fortune.  I am neither dissatisfied nor disgruntled.  I spend more time thinking about my blessings than my challenges.  Yes… I have challenges and struggles, but they pale in comparison.  This trip then is another blessing… an opportunity to push beyond my comfort.  Test myself a little.  I hope to have enough common sense to stay within my limits.  As Patty reminds me, I’m not twenty anymore and I have a family to get home to… and frankly, a life I love!  When she asked me last fall what I wanted to do for my fiftieth birthday, it took time and reflection for me to hit on the trail.  Vegas doesn’t seem a good fit for me.  I have dear and important friends, but we don’t vacation together or otherwise have tightly entwined lives, so a boys trip didn’t resonate either.  But my father has had a rough year health-wise, and seeing his decline reminded me of our short ride on this spinning rock.  Something from my bucket-list seemed in order.  And having made that choice, selling on this hike was almost obvious to me.  I’ve spent the last 6 months preparing… reading; buying gear;  choosing a route; setting dates that work reasonably for work schedule/kids schedule/weather in the trail; plane tickets.  So I now write this at thirty-thousand feet… on the plane to Atlanta and the start of my week in the woods.  Was nervous at the airport… not getting a seat assignment until minutes before boarding.  But Murphy was just reading me… seat 32C on an exit row, and all was well.  I did notice at check-in… I brought my debit card instead of credit!  Maybe that’s another blessing as it will keep me on a shorter leash!  My fifty pound pack has everything I need for five days… perhaps six.  A mail drop awaits at Neels Gap with two more days of food. My boots are broken in.  Map(s), check.  Compass, check.  As long as my pack survived the baggage handlers, I’ll be on my way.  And… touchdown in Atlanta!",,Springer mountain,"Apr 22, Sun",0

I’ll hang here a bit to get a full charge!Not sure my solar charger will be any use these next few days... looks like rain is planned my whole trip.  Well... I wanted an adventure!Count down 90 minutes to the last vehicle and a ride to USFS 42 to git Springer before dark.",,Springer Mountain,"Apr 22, Sun",0

I’m not counting on connectivity much of the time, but I do want a ride back to the airport next weekend!",,View Entry,"Apr 22, Sun",0

Bucket Trekker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587849,"Made it to the top of Springer, took a few photos and tried to call home (with no luck). About 1/3 of the way up Springer, I realized I had been looking down watching the trail… and hadn’t seen any white blazes since starting up.  I kept going, but started to get a little nervous.  I didn’t want to back-track, but didn’t want to be on the wrong trail either.  It was a real relief to see that white blaze! Just shy of the top, I met my first hikers… two of them going the other way.  I had stopped for a moment, and wasn’t paying attention, and it startled me to lookup and see them.  I need to stay aware of surroundings!From then on, I was the only one on the trail.  The rain was constant and soaking… made you appreciate a good pair of boots!It was interesting the variability of the terrain.  Up high, lots of rocky trail. Feels like you’re stepping boulder the boulder.  Then down in the little valleys and there are rhododendron everywhere.I was the last on in to Stover Creek shelter.  Everyone else was already in bed and lights out!  As I approached, I thought I may have it to myself it was so quiet!  But the shelter is actually pretty full.  Luckily there was space for one more, so no tent tonight and I should stay dry!I got the stove going and made my beans and rice meal. Not too bad, and the dehydrated chicken I added gave it so heft!  It was dark by the time I finished cooking… even had to use the headlamp.  Once dinner was done a little clean-up and now I’m snuggled down in my bag.  9pm bedtime, and I’m the one who went to bed late! It feels good to lie down!This shelter has a bear box, so no worries about the food tonight!  The rain continues constant.  There may be a little sun on Tuesday supposedly.  But if not, then not! Thanks again for good boots and gear!G’night all!","

Bucket Trekker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587852,"It rained all day again, but it is what it is.  The mountains are beautiful.  Not many leaves out yet, so some of the views should be spectacular… they still are though perhaps not in the classical sense.  With the rain is a constant fog, so when you get to a view it’s more of a glimpse into the void than a view to distant mountains.  Awe inspiring  just the same.I made 11.4 miles today, 1.5 miles shy of my hopes for Gooch Mountain shelter.  (About 13.6 on the map I left with may family).  So I’ve pitched my tent just before Justice Creek.  There were two guys from Omaha already with tents pitched when I got here… we all agreed that Mt Sassafrass kicked our #*%!  There are actually 3 little “butt kickers” in a row, and it took all I had to make it this far today.Tomorrow’s another day, but I’ve come to terms with the fact that I won’t be able to complete all of Georgia.  I would need at least one more day… perhaps more.  The good news is that I feel somewhat liberated.  There’s no way to hike any of the trail without hard work, so that’s still a given.  But I’ll call it quits at a reasonable time so I can have a good dinner… relax some too!I really missed the family and my normal life today.  I took a picture of the little Lego mascot (mini me) that Carina made, and it made me want to hug her neck! And I’ve been picking up some rocks for Derek’s rock tumbler.  I don’t need the weight, but I look forward to showing them to him!  I tried to text and call Patty a couple of times today… it would say I had signal but the calls and messages would never go through.  I’ll keep trying, but it didn’t feel good to get my hopes up then have then dashed! I’ll miss Alana’s talent show performance.  Brody needs my help on piano.  Yep, I definitely was missing them today!My butter pasta for dinner was a tasty feast!  And the warmth felt good!  I ate back in my tent, and then stripped of all the wet clothes, got it the sleeping bad, and fell asleep… probably 6:30 pm tops.Finally I woke up and got brave enough to put on some wet things, open me tent to take care of my stove, get the phone battery charging so I could write this note.I’ve been getting cramps in my legs while sleeping… did last night and again tonight already.  I guess my legs have many reasons for being upset with me.  Still all in all, I’m glad to be on the journey.  Amazing that people thru-hike the full thing… or even attempt it.  Hats off to all who try,  Now it’s about time to turn in for real!Good night everyone!

Bucket Trekker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587911,"Ignore the 19.0 miles for today... I hadn’t kept the miles up-to-date so am making a one-time correction.Today has been a much more relaxed pace… it’s good to have the pressure off of myself to try and make all of Georgia.Started the day with rain, and putting all the wet things… tent to clothes, sleeping bag to boots… back on or in the back back was a little demoralizing to say the least!  Thank goodness once again for having the right gear… pretty soon the wet socks, boots, pants, shirt, and hat were again keeping me warm (though still wet)!First task of the day was to cross Justice Creek.  The water was over the tops of the rocks… taking my time to be safe with a fifty pound pack… my feet were sloshing at the other side.  Blackwell creek just before Gooch Mountain Shelter was also over the rocks.  So I pulled in at the shelter to eat lunch under a roof and give my soggy feet a chance to air out a little. I was tempted to stay there at the shelter.  The next shelter is at Woods hole which is 12.3 mike further on. Not likely to make that.  After some hemming and hawing, I stepped out again in full knowledge I would be in the tent again tonight.  Um, yea!? It’s nice to have my own space, but it’s not necessarily dry!  But the mountains aren’t going to come to me, so onward.Met 5 people total at the shelter. One a past through-hiker, and four college age who plan to make Maine.  Thanks, but no thanks for me!I did some planning today… paying closer attention to where there’s supposed to be water.  To this point I’ve been carrying perhaps too much.  It’s nice to have the options that affords me, but I’m getting more confident in what I’ll need. Long story short, I took a side trail after Gooch Gap (1.5 miles from the shelter) to “water up”.  The rain had stopped so I laid out some of my gear and then got water.  Once full I tried switching the phone on and behold I could get through! Not ashamed to say I broke down in tears to hear Patty’s voice on the line!  After a nice talk I then took the time to post journal entries I had been saving but unable to post. The off once more.Loosely I had thought of hitting Woody Ga (6.4 miles from my start), or perhaps even Lance Creek (3.3 more).In the end, I stopped early at Ramrock Mountain making for a 4.8 mile day.  I was able to lay things out to dry (had to do it twice as I got rained on the first time!), pitches my tent, made a great meal. And best of all, was able to get enough signal to call home and talk to all the kids and Patty again!  I got choked up again!So now it’s getting late again (8:40 pm!), so I’ll wrap-up telling Alana, Derek, Carina, and Brody nighty-night, I love you, and hugs and kisses to each of you.  And to Patty a special I love you, hug, and kiss.  Thank you for letting me go off on this crazy adventure.Tomorrow I intend to make at least Jarred Gap (7.1 miles) or even Woods Hole shelter (8.5 miles).  We’ll see what I’ve got in the tank.  Would like to get to Neel’s Gap by Thursday… A hostel bed and a shower are luxuries beyond comprehension!Good night all!","

Bucket Trekker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588086,"I started my day atop Rimrock mountain… it always takes a long time to pack up after a wet night!  Not as wet as the night before, and luckily I had a chance to partially dry my sleeping bag. I ate a light breakfast of food bar, trail mix, and salami and got going at 9 local time.The good thing about sleeping on a mountain top is that it’s downhill first thing!  But before long I started up the next hill.  In Georgia, they don’t much believe in switchbacks, mostly choosing to go straight over the top and straight down the other side.I made it to Woody Gap about a mile and a half in… finally starting to get my legs under me and figure out how to cope with the hills.  Counting steps seems to help keep me motivated.  On the steep slopes I’ll take 50 steps, or even 10, pause to let my legs loosen, then 50 (or 10) more.At Woody Gap, I crossed the road towards the trail, and an elderly man (Big T) was sitting in his van asking if anyone needed a ride.  Well, I’ve made peace with this adventure… I can do it, and would get stronger as I went, but the lure of home is too strong.  So $39 bucks and 30 minutes later I find myself at Neels Gap!I was the first to check into the hostel, so got my choice of bunks.  Bought a hot cup of coffee and a cold Coke.  And have spent the rest of the morning and early afternoon drying things out, doing laundry in the sink, trying to have something dry and a little less stinky to change into before hitting that shower!Patty booked me a return flight home, and I booked a morning ride down to the Marta station.I don’t have a single regret… it’s been a difficult few days on the trail, but rewarding in its own right.  This last night in the hostel will give me a warm dry place to sleep, a hot shower, and even a microwave to cook my oatmeal in the morning! And then home to where I belong!Maybe I’ll be back some day for a few more miles, or maybe not.  It’s a great place, this trail… I would highly recommend it.  It you do, I hope you spend time planning… it makes you look critically at the journey.  And once on the trail, don’t be afraid to lay your plans aside.  Life is good!","Ramrock Mountain
