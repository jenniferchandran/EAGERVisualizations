Control C and KY Bourbon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593185,"It's been awhile since we've been hiking, so today's planned 11.3 mile outing was going to be a bit of a challenge.  It was all that, and more.
After catching a ride with Trail Angel Lisa from our destination to our start location, we started our hike around 9:30 AM.  It was a cool, cloudy day, with a chance of light rain early afternoon.  We soon realized that our Connecticut AT hike was not going to be the piece of cake that we had envisioned.  CT is much rockier, with steeper ascents/descents, than we had imagined.  The countryside is beautiful, with lush greenery all around.  We were thankful that the one major stream crossing was bridged, as a significant amount of rain had swollen the stream to river proportions.  We did break out the rain jackets briefly on a couple occasions, but never for more than 10 minutes.
We made several stops, including for fried egg and turkey sandwiches (not both at once), chocolate, apples and almonds.  Not very imaginative, but it kept us going.  We both ran out of water in our 3 lt bladders, which had been full, but fortunately had both brought an extra bottle of water as a refill.  There were plenty of streams where we could have refilled, but we still aren't used to getting water that way.
Our GPS measured the trail at 11.2 miles, with about 2350 ft ascent and 2240 ft descent.
We gave a thru-hiker a lift into Kent as we left our destination.  It felt good to help someone else out.
We're staying in a Home-Away (Bill Geiger's place) in Lakeville, CT.  Very comfortable, but pricey.  Dinner was pizza at Mizza's in Lakeville.  Yum! ","CT/NY State Line (CT 55)

Control C and KY Bourbon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593253,"Today's hike was to be our ""easy"" day's hike in Connecticut.  The trail map showed about 5 and 1/2 miles of relatively flat hiking along the river.  The distance was about the same as yesterday, and a lot shorter distances than the next two days.  Easy, right?
After scouting out parking areas in the Cornwall Bridge area, KY Bourbon suggested that we flip our hike, going north to south instead of our originally planned south to north.  So, we met Trail Angel Lisa again on CT 341, where we left our rental car.  After a quick drive up to CT 4, we got started about 9:15.  
The initial climb was steep and rocky, just as many of the ascents the previous day had been.  That was followed by a steep descent down to the Housatonic River, where the trail gave way to a beautiful walk along the river and through nearby fields of flowers (lots of purple clover and white flowers that smelled like jasmine).  It all seemed pretty easy.  Except...
As we left the river walk and headed back into the woods, a trio of northbound thru hikers asked us ""Are you going up The Stairs?"".  Figuring that was something ahead of us, we said ""yes"" and continued on, but wondering what they might have meant.  We knew we were in store for an ascent, but we weren't really prepared for what was to come.
The Stairs are almost a straight-up climb on high rock steps and boulders.  I swear we climbed about 700 ft in less than 1/4 mile.  It seemed like they were never going to end.  We could only imagine how the northbound thru hikers must feel, as they not only had to descend The Steps, but had to do so with full packs on.  That would truly be a vertigo-inducing challenge.
The rest of the hike was uneventful, but we did get to enjoy several outcropping views of the Connecticut countryside.  We met many northbound thru hikers all day long, and were amazed at how far they had hiked since starting in Georgia in March or even April.  One thru hiker, with the trail name Gumby, was a former Air Force colonel who had flown C-130's.  That required a bit of the ""name game"" with KY Bourbon before we let him get on his way.In total, we had 1600 ft ascent and 1950 ft descent, another reason we were greatful that we had flipped the direction of the hike.
After our hike, we headed into Kent for some ice cream at Annie Bananie's, which is a great place for hikers to rejuvenate their spirits.  
Dinner tonight will be salad, spaghetti and beer at our Home Away.","Cornwall Bridge (CT 4)

Control C and KY Bourbon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593375,"Today's hike was much more like we expected hiking the AT in Connecticut to be like.  Yes, there were ups and downs, but not as steep as the past two days.  Yes, there were rocks, but not as many as the past two days.  We again met Trail Angel Lisa (aka Jaguar Paw) for a shuttle ride to our hike start location at 8:45 and were hiking by 9:15.  The early part of the hike had its share of rocks, but gradually gave way to an cushy trail surface of leaves and/or pine needles.  There were some beautiful streams, along with waterfalls, on the first third of the hike.While we were back to hiking south to north today, we did pass a few thru-hikers, including some we had seen yesterday.  However, there were three thru-hikers who BLEW past us.  We were impressed with their ability to navigate trail obstacles while maintaining a 3+ MPH pace.At 14.1 miles, with 2200 ft ascent and 2375 ft descent, it was the toughest hike we've done in almost a year.  There weren't as much wildlife as our first day (fewer birds, squirrels or chipmunks) nor as many flowers as our second day.  And definitely not as many scenic vistas of the Connecticut countryside.  But we still enjoyed it.Hike breaks included turkey sandwiches, cantaloupe, greek salads, leftover pizza, chocolate, an orange and banana.  We ate plenty during the hike.  Dinner was hamburgers at Black Rabbit Bar & Grille while we watched Game 5 of the Capitals/Vegas Stanley Cup Finals.  Go Caps!","Cornwall Bridge (CT 4)

Control C and KY Bourbon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593460,"Today we made the wide decision to flip-flop again, starting north and heading south.  This gave us a hike with much more descent than ascent.  And, believe me, we needed the downhill.Trail Angel Lisa (aka Jaguar Paw) again picked us up at her usual ""early"" time of 8:45 and we were at the trailhead by 9:30.  An easy 0.7 mile hike on a side trail got us to the Appalachian Trail just south of the Massachusetts/Connecticut border.  Just to be sure we were ""official"", we headed north for about 1/10 of a mile until the GPS showed that we were squarely over the MA border.  We then turned around and headed south.Our first climb turned out to be the toughest of the day.  Going up Bear Mountain (the highest summit in CT) was a real challenge.  A thru-hiker had cautioned us before we began our approach (he said he had slid down on his butt much of the way), but we found sufficient footing to make the climb without much difficulty.The view from Bear Mountain was stunning.  Not quite 360, but gorgeous from the ENE to the ESE.  We began a long gradual descent, with a second great view from Lion's Head.  While continuing our descent towards Salisbury, we stopped to talk to several thru hikers, including one from England who excitedly reported seeing his first AT bear near Falls Village.  A female thru-hiker told us a story about her food being stolen by another hiker.  Sad!The second half of the hike, from Salisbury to Falls Village, was boring and tedious.  We were anxious to be finished.  We discussed spending another day on the trail tomorrow, getting our first 10 miles of MA completed, but by the end of the hike, any thoughts of hiking tomorrow were out of the question.  Besides hiking just a hair over 14 miles today, we also had 1675 ft ascent and 2875 ft descent.  We came back to our Home Away and, still in our hiking clothes, sat outside to enjoy some wine, cheese and crackers.  We tired and glad to be done with the AT in Connecticut.","Mount Washington Rd (CT/MA border)

Control C and KY Bourbon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603638,"We met our shuttle driver, Susan, near the rail trail in Cheshire.  From there, she took what seemed to be a roundabout way to our drop-off destination on Notch Road just to the north of Mount Greylock.  But, Control C left the direction finding to Susan, not saying a word to her.
Tonto was feeling better from her previous day's cold, so it was once again Brewha and Tonto both hiking with us, but this time in a N to S direction. 
We had hoped for a good weather day to hike Mount Greylock, but this day (a Monday to also avoid the crowds) was anything but good.  It was windy and chilly and, once we reached the ridgeline, we were hiking in the clouds.  Near the summit, we stopped in a small skier/hiker rescue shelter, where we had a light snack.  It was only then that we realized that the Bascom Lodge on the top of Mount Greylock was open and serving hot meals.  
We passed the War Memorial on the top of Mount Greylock, unable to see it in the fog.  But the Lodge was a welcome respite and, even though we got there at 10:45, 15 minutes before they started serving, we were happy to sit and have a cup of hot coffee.  We split a burger and bowl of clam chowder, followed by a apple cobbler that was more like a strudel.  We also bought cookies and a brownie to go.
The hike down from Mount Greylock saw a gradual improvement in the weather; at least we were no longer in the clouds.  Most of that hike was uneventful, other than the last mile into Cheshire seeming to be like one of those long-distance hikes were you see the town, but it takes forever to actually get to it.
We left Cheshire and headed home, where we had a supper of brats, red cabbage, sauerkraut and beer, prepared by Tonto with a little help from Brewha, which was delicious.  After dinner, Brewha made a fire in the pit and we had s'mores. 
The excitement that night was a bear who took the wooden garbage box off the back porch.  That bear was not quiet and, at first, we thought that someone was trying to break into the house (and not a quiet break-in, at that!).  Control C was able to scare the bear away by unlocking and re-locking the car, thus causing the lights to flash.  Brewha also came down to check out the commotion while Kentucky Bourbon monitored everything from upstairs.  Tonto slept through the entire ordeal, thanks to the cold medicine she was taking.  Unfortunately, nobody saw the bear, but we did listen for it to return during the little bit of sleep we got the rest of the night.

Control C and KY Bourbon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603639,"The forecast was for rain all day, with about 1.5"" of total accumulation.  So, we decided to take a zero day.  Besides missing the bad weather, we also hoped it would give Tonto more time to get over her cold.
We spent the morning hanging around the house, mostly just doing laundry.  We decided to head out for lunch and we left the house around 1:30, only to discover that the car wouldn't start.  A handyman who happened to be on-site had jumper cables, so he gave the car a jump.  It finally started, but the battery didn't seem to be the issue.  It was more like water in the gas line, a bad starter, or some other mechanical problem.  Regardless, we no longer felt the car was reliable.
We called Enterprise and, after a lot of back-and-forth, Brewha got them to agree to deliver a replacement vehicle via tow-truck to the house.  Since we were already out, we ran over to the Becket General Store Restaurant to pick up a couple pizzas, as we were afraid of being stuck at home without a car or without food.
We had finished lunch when the tow-truck arrived with the replacement vehicle around 3:30.  After being stuck at home almost all day, we quickly got ready and headed out to scout the hike for Day 7.  After that scouting, we headed to the Barrington Brewery & Restaurant for dinner.  That place has great solar-power made beers, but it was their double-stout chocolate cake that blew our socks off.  We considered having a nightcap at the Red Lion Inn in Stockbridge, but decided to call it a night instead and headed back to the house. ","N/A

Control C and KY Bourbon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603640,"We expected today to not be a pretty day, as thunderstorms were forecast with about a 1/3"" of rain accumulation.  Boy, was that wrong.  We didn't see any thunderstorms all day and, while it was overcast for much of the day, there were periods of sunshine.
We left the house about 9:00 to head for breakfast at Ozzie's in Hinsdale.  Boy, was that place good.  The special that Kentucky Bourbon and I had was a French Toast coated in corn flakes, served with a blueberry-blackberry glaze and lemon sauce.  Yum!  Their hash was also very good.
After breakfast, we headed for Lenox, where we walked around the historic downtown.  Their library was particularly enjoyable.  
Then, we headed to Hilltop Orchards.  The wine tasting was NOT good and we, for once, didn't buy any bottles of wine.
We made a ""late"" decision to head back to the summit of Mount Greylock, as we hadn't done all of the AT on the summit.  We arrived at the summit just as a cloud overtook the mountain.  Still, we were able to see a bit more of the surrounding scenery that we had been able to do on Day 6.  At least, we were able to scratch the summit from our hiking ""to do"" list.  We also picked up a couple hundred yards of AT which we previously had missed.
We decided to skip going out for dinner, opting instead to head back to the house to eat leftovers (pizza, chili, beef tips, salad and wine).  A tournament of cornhole preceded dinner.  The rain arrived about 8:00 PM.Control C and Kentucky Bourbon","N/A

Control C and KY Bourbon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603667,"We arrived early at Grange Hall Road, but fortunately, our shuttle driver Susan did too.  So, we were able to start hiking at County Road at 8:10, our earliest start in Massachusetts.  We were again hiking with Brewha and Tonto, in a S to N direction.
The morning half of the trail was quite wet, as it had rained a cumulative total of 4"" over the previous 2 days (our 2 zero days).  There wasn't much climb or descent, but it still seemed like the trail had turned into a small stream.  That made for slow hiking and we were averaging just a 1.5 mph pace early on.  But we were hiking under beautiful blue skies, our prettiest day yet in Massachusetts, so the extra water on the trail was the only wetness we needed to worry about..
The only view of the entire day's hike was from Warner Hill, which is near where Susan lives.  It was a great view and we could easily see Mount Greylock and other surrounding mountains, even into Vermont.  The rest of the hike was uneventful and we finished at 2:15.
