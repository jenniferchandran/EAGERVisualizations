ROAM,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561833,"For my 65th birthday present, I started hiking the Appalachian Trail (AT).
This was preceded by several months of studying equipment, reading books and blogs. I actually got interested in the AT by reading Bill Bryson's ""Walk in the Woods"", a 1998 autobiographical book that I borrowed from my daughter Lindsay.
With all that research, I felt I had a ""pretty good handle"" on the equipment side of things. Purchasing the equipment turned out to be the easy part. Now, it was time for the physical testing and training.
We, my dear wife Laurie and I, traveled with our 5th wheel trailer to Standing Indian State Park campground near Franklin, North Carolina, arriving on Monday, April 10th.
Tuesday, April 11th, my birthday, Laurie and I did a short hike from Rock Gap 105.9 to Winding Stair 109.5 and back to Rock Gap 105.9 for 7.2 miles. Those ""funny"" numbers are the AT NOBO (North-bound) mileages. Most AT hikers hike the AT NOBO, but many hike it SOBO (South-bound), and some even do it in a flip-flop approach (starting somewhere in the middle like Harpers Ferry, WV, to an AT end-point then go back to do the remaining portion), many do sections of the AT over several years, and many do one to many day hikes on the AT and connecting blue trails or spurs. Throw in scout troops, weekend warriors, spring breakers, and vacationers and you can never guess who you might meet on the AT or how busy it might be.
On the initial hike with Allie, our English Pointer dog, on a leash to Laurie, and I with full 30LB pack (lite by many standards) enjoyed ourselves immensely! Hiking uphill’s were demanding, however.","Rock Gap 105.9

ROAM,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561834,"The next day, Wednesday, I hiked alone from Winding Stair 109.5 to Wayah Gap 115.4 for 5.9 miles. This section of the AT had been closed for several days due to fires and smoke, but had just opened up this morning for hikers. Even the long downhill into Wayah Gap was hard on my shins and my thighs became shaky.","Winding Stair 109.5

ROAM,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561835,"With the initial shakedown hikes completed, it was time for some multi-day and overnight hikes. This would be much tougher shakedown testing, to say the least. But, first we took a break to visit our son Matthew and his wife Julianne in Huntersville, NC, for the Easter weekend. Following that wonderful visit, we moved our trailer to Grayson Highlands State Park in Virginia on Monday, April 17th. This is located on US-58 about midway between Galax and Damascus. Traveling these roads is slow, curvy, mountain driving, and it takes much longer to get around than you'd think it should.
I started a 2 day shakedown hike on Tuesday, April 18th, heading northbound on the AT, from US-58 near Damascus, in light rain. Damascus US-58 470.2 to Lost Mountain Shelter 485.0 for 14.8 miles (overnight in tent), plus 1 mile because I went the wrong way on the Virginia Creeper bike trail that parallels the AT for a bit, and is used as a detour for the AT, due to washouts. Almost called my ""end of the day"" 2.5 miles earlier than I'd hoped to, but a barefoot hiker that passed by made me think I ""should"" be able to continue on to the Lost Mountain shelter. Arrived there at 7:30pm and set up my tent, since the shelter was full (of course). Cold, dark, and rain increasing, I decided to go to bed, without dinner (even though I wasn't ""naughty"" that day, except for doing the high miles for being an inexperienced hiker). Oh yes, hang my food bag, or feed the bears? It rained on and off all night with lots of wind. Inflatable pad kept sliding downhill when I rolled over. Might take another look at those Therm-a-Rest Z-pads, which might not be as slippery, plus they're lighter. Sure liked my Therm-a-Rest Z-seat to keep the South side dry and cushioned! I slept on and off all night. But, I stayed warm and dry. Bag and tent worked great. Socks on my feet were very helpful in the bag.","Damascus US-58 470.2

ROAM,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561836,"Did Lost Mountain Shelter 485.0 to Elk Garden 493.2 for 8.2 miles on Wednesday, April 19th, and called it quits due to ""I'm done in!"" I still had about 4 to 9 miles to the next camps. There were possible thunderstorms coming anyway. Laurie rescued me from the trail with a ride back to Grayson Highlands State Park.
Those uphill hikes are killers, and I'm told Georgia is loaded with them. And, are even worse!
Summary:1) Slowly work up on mileage. Not overboard right off like I did on this 2 day hike. 2) Reduce my body weight, a minimum of 15LBS, to help my knees. 3) Reduce my pack weight at least 5LBS, even though I'm already light. Had several hikers comment on my light pack. Told them I wished it felt light. LOL!4) Considering going back to light shoes. However, at least half a dozen times, my ankles were saved from injury by having the mid-height boots. Someone mentioned each pound on your feet is like 5LBS in your pack.
Saw some OR gators that were light and would keep stones and more out of my boots!
More thoughts:1) Take off boots mid-day to rest feet. 2) Pack off at breaks, or at least, sit on a rock wide enough to support the pack to give shoulders a break. 3) Eat often, just like fuel for your vehicle. 4) Drink lots of water. Both filter and Aqua Mira drops in water from the trail, just to be safe, important. 5) Hygiene important at shelters and privies. 6) Don't trust that the tables are clean, just because they're outdoors. 
Hand sanitizer is a big help, plus you can use it as a fire starter, if necessary.
Maybe a RatSack so the mice cannot chew into your food, important for shelters, because rumor has it that those are infested with mice. REI has those and has an incredible return policy! One guy put 100 miles on a pair of boots, and then returned them for full credit!
Maybe I should try a hammock with a tarp over instead of the tent? I’m thinking about that. My daughter had asked me about this, but I already had the lightweight tent.","Lost Mountain Shelter 485.0

Some take a ""nero day"" which means nearly zero miles hiked, but this is a very loose term and subject to many interpretations. As I muse over hiking issues, I decide that 10 miles per day is plenty, for me. Then I turn my attention to my pack, which I'm thinking is about 30LBS. I start pitching items I'm not using. I settle for just 3 days of food. Decide to carry only 1L of water, instead of 2. I got my pack down to 20LBS.",,GHSP zero,"Apr 20, Thu",0
ROAM,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561838,"Friday, April 21st, Laurie brings me back to Elk Garden, where she rescued me 2 days before. I thought it'd be nice to pick up where I faded. She and Allie hiked with me for a bit, and then turned back. Near Grayson Highlands SP, I’m navigating thru some rock formations, see 5 hikers coming out of a cave on my right, talking loudly having a good time, while I’m trying to look like I know what I’m doing and I slip on a rock and go down on my right side. One of them comes over quickly, stops me from going down completely, and helps me back up. My guardian angel? Talk with them a bit and continue. I’d better watch my steps on wet rocks! However, seems wet roots are worse! Elk Garden 493.2 to Wise Shelter 502.5 for 9.3 miles (overnight in tent). Shelter full by the time I got there around 5:30pm. Apparently, if you want to stay in a shelter, seems you better get there early to mid-afternoon!","Elk Garden 493.2

ROAM,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561839,"Saturday, April 22nd, I leave the Wise Shelter camp site about 8am. Get moving nicely. Except I'm so engrossed by my progress, I lose track of the AT markings and get off on a blue blaze spur trail. When I finally realize my mistake, and wonder what happened to the hiker behind me, I pull out my smart phone and use the Guthook’s app with GPS positioning (works in ""airplane mode"" to save battery). Thinking I now know how to get back on the AT, I go another 1/4 mile. Nope! Then I pull out my cheap compass, because it's so overcast I cannot discern directions. Finally, I'm back on the AT at what's called the Scales. Actually, I miss breakfast ""trail magic"" there  Hikers love these! Free food! However, about noon, I come across a guy called Evil grilling hamburgs, hotdogs, and brats! That's his trail name and he does this ""trail magic"" quite often. Wow! That takes care of lunch today  Wise Shelter 502.5 to Hurricane Shelter 513.4 for 10.9 miles (overnight in shelter). First time in a shelter! Very nice! I arrived about 1:30pm because I was moving along so fast. Shelter ends up full, too, with someone in a hammock out front. Last hiker came in right as its getting dark!

ROAM,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561840,"Sunday, April 23rd, and it's cold and wet this morning, about 42F. Puff/down jacket and wool base layer keeps me warm. After a doctored oatmeal breakfast (I mixed in granola and dried fruit), heated with my JetBoil, I'm off again about 8am. Rain picks up gradually. I'm overdressed with the base layer, puff jacket, and hiking pants. So gradually I remove the excess layers I never should have had on to begin with. Better to start cold and warm up with the exercise of hiking. This is one of the many lessons the AT has taught me. My destination for the day is Trimpi Shelter 522.6 for 9.2 miles. When I get there, I didn't like the looks of Trimpi Shelter, plus nothing but heavy rain. So, I continue hiking after a short rest the extra 2.1 miles out to the parking lot on a remote country road where Laurie was to pick me up tomorrow morning. However, with no cell phone coverage anywhere in this area, I cannot let her know I need to be rescued, again! 
I have 3 options: 1) Continue hiking about 8 miles to Partnership Shelter where there's a phone to order pizza or shuttle to Marion,2) Setup my tent in the rain to spend the night near the parking lot I'll hopefully be picked up at in the morning,3) Hitch-hike somewhere with better phone coverage to contact Laurie.
Definitely didn't want to hike another 8 miles (see, I did learn that lesson). Definitely didn't want to setup my tent in the rain. That leaves hitch-hiking, something I haven't done since college, as far as I can remember, which was over 40 years ago! The first vehicle I raise my thumb to is a pickup truck that actually accelerates by me. Then a SUV that slows a bit but upon final inspection of me continues without stopping. Then another goes by. I walk back into the woods to reconsider tent camping and am again dismayed by that option. I head back to the road to try some more. Maybe if I could walk the road to better coverage. Now I'm praying ""Lord, I REALLY need a ride! It's the only real option I have! Please!"" About 75 feet down the road along comes a Subaru with 2 older gentlemen. It stops and the driver rolls down the window. I ask if he knows where there might be better phone coverage. He replies that there is NO phone coverage in this area! Great! So, I ask if he's heading somewhere where there would be coverage and he replies they are heading to Marion. I ask if I could get a ride there and he says ""Sure!"", opens the trunk for my pack and poles, pulls out a small tarp to put on the back seat for this drowned rat of a hiker to sit on, and away I go thanking the Lord for His awesome answer. I ask if I could be dropped at a good restaurant in Marion, but am informed there is only a Mexican restaurant that would be very busy, so it's down to Hardee's, Wendy's, or McDonald's. I pick McDonald's because I can get a senior coffee there that sounds heavenly. I'm told by these guys that they have NEVER been down the road they found me on, but just decided to take it to town. Hmmm! I think I know why 
We arrive at the Marion McDonald's and I thank the driver profusely while I get my pack and poles. I walk in and everyone is staring at me. I must look like a swamp monster? I decide to take a seat at a small table by the door I came in, away from everyone else. Text Laurie and tell her where I am and I'll wait until she arrives. I find out later she had no idea when to pick me up, so even if I had camped overnight at the parking lot, I'd still be in the same predicament. I order a Big Mac meal with a large coffee that was freshly brewed and eat the nastiest and best meal I've had for quite a while. Followed by more coffee and an apple pie! I make friends with ""Grandma"" who comes back to the table next to me to claim her sweater left there (I was wondering about that). Everyone knows ""Grandma"", so I meet more folks from Marion. I think she used to work at this McDonald's. Laurie finally arrives about 2 hours later, meets ""Grandma"", hears details from my hike, and warms my heart 
So, today was Hurricane Shelter 513.4 to VA670 524.7 for 11.3 miles (get an answer to prayer and a ride to Marion).","Hurricane Shelter 513.4

ROAM,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563026,"Picked up a pair of Hoka One One trail running shoes from REI as a possible replacement for the Lowa Renegade boots that developed a leak in the left toe box.  Tried them out on this short day hike near Hot Springs, NC.  Seemed to have nice cushion, actually a lot of cushion.  But, even during this short hike, I developed several hot spots which usually indicate the beginning of blisters.  Did not have this issue with the boots.  However, the Hoka shoes were very light weight.  The trail here was a good mix of grades with smooth and rocky areas.  Returned the shoes the next day.  I'm doing more research on footwear now. I also looked at hammock solutions at REI, but that's going to take time, as well.  My current shelter is a LightHeart SoLong 6 with a weight of 31 OZ, and I'm thinking any hammock solution will weigh a bit more.",,Pump Gap Trail 276.8,"May 03, Wed",3
ROAM,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582371,"Equipment is complete, except for the never-ending review, tweaking, etc. which is very enjoyable.  I'm sure the folks at MooseJaw are getting tired of seeing me visit them so often.  Just reviewed my hiking equipment purchasing history this morning that started early March, 2017, and was amazed that I began my first test hikes near Franklin, NC, early April, 2017.  Many equipment changes since then.  Cannot emphasize enough the importance of good planning to anyone considering a thru hike!  Much easier and safer than doing it on the trail, especially when it comes to footwear.  My dear wife told me I couldn't go on a thru hike without preparing physically.  My first response was ""hiking the trail will be my preparation!""  She didn't buy that! LOL ;)  So, I surprised her when I started using a physical trainer that my oldest son and his wife had been using.  Very glad I did.  The trainer actually told me that the thru hike would be a vacation compared to training with him!  My weight when I started the physical training in early December 2017 was 190, and is now 184.  Eating healthier with lots of proteins to maintain muscle mass.  Hoping to have that in the 170-180 range by early March 2018, my hoped for start date for a VA-ME / VA-GA Flip-Flop thru hike.Other than the usual ""deer in the headlights"" look I get when people hear what I'm planning to do are the following basic questions:  1) Are you bringing protection (gun, knife, mace, etc.)?  No and yes.  God has been my assurance this far and that's not going to change.2) What is your wife going to do while you're hiking?  Whatever she wants!  She'll be shadowing me for part of the time.  She has wanted to do some things with our home that never seem to make it to the top of my ""honey do list"", so I'm sure when I return I'll be pleasantly surprised.  Actually, I've been telling her this will be a great trial-run for me passing before her so we can get the ""kinks"" ironed out.It's amazing how preparation for this thru hike has taken over all aspects of my life over the last year!  It's affected my sleep and what I think about throughout the day.  Hiking for 7 months will be SO different than what my daily existence has looked like thus far.  Since retiring at the end of June, 2017, so much has already changed!  2018 should add so much more change!",,Virginia,"Jan 24, Wed",0
ROAM,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583026,"The most important equipment item to me is footwear for my upcoming AT thru hike.  Thought I'd elaborate on my trials trying to find something to fit my wide feet.  Somewhere along my research path I came across outdoorgearlab.com which was a great help, but many of the highly rated footwear items are not available in wide sizes.  This seems to be due to the fact that most high end boots are made on European ""lasts"" which are too narrow for me.
A year ago, I started with a pair of ""Lowa Men's Renegade GTX Mid Hiking Boot, 11 W US"".  On test hikes in the rain during April/May 2017 the left toe box leaked after two days.  These boots should be classified as ""hiking"" or first tier footwear that are a bit lightweight for the AT.  I should have been looking for ""backpacking"" or second tier footwear for better protection.  Third tier or ""mountaineering"" footwear would be overkill for the AT.
I've heard of many hikers using trail runner shoes on the AT.  Be careful if you choose these.  No ankle support and almost no protection for the many rocks.  I picked up a pair of ""Saucony Men's Kinvara 7 Running Shoe, 11 M US"" which I really liked but after numerous sad stories of damaged feet, I decided to keep looking.  I even tried a pair of ""Hoka One One trail running shoes"" but they caused hot spots (beginning of blisters) after only 4 hours of test AT hiking.  The rocker sole on these take some getting used to.
Then the many stories of no way to avoid wet feet on the AT.  Got some advice to use Rocky waterproof socks paired with non-waterproof boots.  Many think WP boots won't be after a few rains on the AT.  Toe liner socks also were recommended to prevent blisters between toes, but they don't seem to work for me.  I tried those along with my Darn Tough hiking socks and Rocky WP socks and found my toes were cold from lack of circulation and 3 layers too wide even for wide boots.
Too lightweight footwear that I tried included ""KEEN Men's Targhee II Mid"", and ""Merrell Men's Moab Ventilator Hiking"" boots and shoes, ""North Face Men's Ultra Fastpack II Mid GTX Hiking Boots"", ""Vasque Men's St. Elias Gore-Tex Backpacking Boots"".  Even tried some ""North Face Snowsquall Mid GTX Insulated"" boots but they made me sweat - didn't breath.
Too narrow, but nicely made, included ""Salomon Men's Quest 4d 2 Gtx Backpacking Boots"", ""Scarpa Men's Zodiac Plus Gtx Hiking Boots"".
If I was going to hike in shoes I'd use my ""North Face Ultra 109 GTX hiking shoes"", the top recommendation on outdoorgearlab.com.  I also love my ""North Face Hedgehog Mid GTX boots"" for being lightweight, but not heavy duty enough for the AT.
A week ago, I started feeling like I needed to make a footwear decision, considering my hike was starting in about a month!  So, my wife and I drove 75 miles to the REI in Ann Arbor, MI, to try on their boots.  I'd read numerous blogs and forums on boot selection for proper fit, so I felt I was as ready to pick a pair as I'd ever be.  I tried everything REI had to offer.  I ended up buying the ""Asolo Men's TPS 520 GV Boots"", a good second tier backpacking boot.  They're a bit pricier and heavier than what I was hoping to use, but they have the protection I need.  Asolo is one of the only boots made on American ""lasts"", which is nice for us wide feet folks.  I'm going to use some custom orthotics instead of the insoles that came with the boots.",,Virginia,"Feb 17, Sat",0

I met Mike doing an interesting south bound (SOBO) flip-flop from Harpers Ferry, WV, to Springer Mountain, GA, then Mount Katahdin, ME, to Harpers Ferry, WV.  I'm doing a mixed direction north bound (NOBO) flip-flop from Troutville, VA, to Mount Katahdin, ME, then SOBO from Troutville, VA, to Springer Mountain, GA.  My hike was to try to avoid the ""bubble"" of hikers starting from Springer Mountain, GA.

My intended destination for the day was Wilson Creek Shelter.  Mike told me he saw one guy there already early in the afternoon.  When I arrived a party of 5 young hikers had also arrived.  I asked about space in the shelter, which has room for 6, and was happy to hear that 2 of the hikers planned to stay in their tents, leaving space for me.

After dinner, I took some vitamin I (Ibuprofen), which is going to become a staple until my body adjusts to the rigors of this hiking adventure.  Oh, dinner was one of these dehydrated meals, which all seem to come with 2 servings, which is too much for us old folks to finish.  No problem – the young hiker guys finished off what I couldn’t, with pleasure.
Shortly after dark everyone headed for bed.  Soon after that a monster thunder storm began with very loud thunder along with what sounded like hail.  One of the hikers in a tent had water coming in and ended up with a soaking wet sleeping bag.  He was able to borrow some dry clothing from one of his friends and they commenced taking turns in a dry sleeping bag.  I did get some sleep, considering 2 of the shelter dwellers were snoring loudly.","US Route 11 730.6

Views were fantastic today!  Many “mountain top” experiences, giving me time for reflection and prayer.  It was partly cloudy, still early spring with not many leaves, and able to see for miles.  I especially liked the Buchanan View and various Blue Ridge Parkway sights.  Never saw another hiker on the trail today, so it was true solitude.

Chance of rain was in the forecast for today, but it never showed.  Thank you Lord!  Sure enjoyed the hike today, which has been my goal for this adventure.  My intent is NOT to try to set any records.  Sure, I have that competitive nature, like most folks.  But many who have hurried this hike have stated that they wished they’d have taken more time during their hike to enjoy the views, relax, slow down when some part their body says OUCH, etc.  Granted, a number of hikers have a limited window of time and money for this adventure, which is why we hear “hike your own hike” repeated by many.  Well, I’m trying to do just that.  We’ll see what the “pudding” looks like as things progress ;)

Thank you Donna, again, for the “fanny pack”!  It’s attached to my backpack waist belt.  Been a wonderful addition to my equipment and allows me to keep things close at hand.  Man purse?  Maybe ;)

Water on the trail was scarce again today, just like yesterday.  I’m learning to keep an eye on water sources and comments on them in my maps.  It’s even scarcer in the summer months.  I filled up shortly after Jennings Creek from a little stream and even added NUUN electrolytes (see the pic of me using my MST Trailshot filter).  I think I drank at least 1.5 liters of water today.

Bryant Ridge Shelter (2 levels and room for 20) and its “privy with a view” are reported to be among the best from hiker comments I’ve read (see pics).

The snow coverage map NOBO (north bound) ahead of me show quite a bit of snow on the trail.  The near future weather forecasts for the next shelter I’d stay at, Thunder Hill Shelter elevation 3960’, look rather dire, too.  Winds, more snow, and low temps.

We, Laurie and I, decide we’ll visit some nearby friends and wait again for spring to come and melt some of this white stuff.  Hiking thru a foot or more of snow, at elevations on the trail, especially considering the uphill climbs, or worse yet, the downhill slides, is not something you want to read about on my blog.

Not wanting to hike in snow, due to the danger of slipping or falling, the choice was made to visit friends in the area while waiting for warmer temps to melt the snow on the AT that appears to be 18"" and deeper in many parts.  I'm using the ""snow cover"" overlay on my iPhone WZZM weather app to monitor the melt progress for the trail NOBO to the Virginia cities I'll be hiking toward next - Glasgow and Buena Vista.  I'm also using the site atweather.org for the Thunder Hill Shelter elevation 3960' that would be my first overnight when I return to the trail.  That site's forecast for the next week indicates that the first warm, snow melting capable temps won't be here until next week Wednesday, March 28.  Wind advisories indicate drifting snow.  Many hikers caught on the trail in these areas hit by heavy snow are struggling.
I feel very blessed not being on the trail right now, actually thanking God for His protection, while praying for the many hikers still on the trail in these conditions.  Today's verse from Psalm 91:1 ""Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty"".  Interesting that the word ""shelter"" would appear today considering that AT hikers often count on shelters for much needed protection.  So, I'm just waiting on God for what's next...",,"Knoxville, TN","Mar 21, Wed",0

Nice views of Black Rock Overlook and Apple Orchard Mountain. Remnants of ice and snow still visible occasionally. 
I even listened to some bluegrass music during the afternoon hiking. Offline, of course, to protect battery life. Airplane mode and low battery settings helped with this. 
Only saw one other hiker today, which makes sense, considering the hike I'm on. Lots of water to pick from. Squirrels were throwing shells at me. Birds giving away my possible stealth hike thru the woods. A solitary chipmunk noted my passing, only to retire underground for safety. Lots of deer prints, coyote dung, possible bear diggings seen. 
True solitude in today's hike. Better that way, so no one would frown at my singing. We all sing great when no one's listening, right?
Looking forward to upcoming Easter weekend with family. Good time to reflect on God's gift!
Good to be hiking again after a week off. Glad to see the snow in huge retreat. Feeling very blessed. Thankful my dear is still with me for a spell. I realize not all wives are cheerleaders of their husband hikers.

Yes, I'm trying my best to be an AT purist, even though that mentality is a personal conviction issue debated often by many in the hiker crowd. It involves more than just the trail you hike.

Thank you Natalie for the free shuttle ride in your car to Hawksbill Parking where I'll resume my thru-hike, albeit, in a slacking manner. She is a nursing student needing a break. She's a bit tentative about hiking alone this morning. I try to reassure her. She offers a great protein bar for my hike today.
I'm staying at the Open Arms Hostel in Luray, VA, for a few days. Alison owns it, lives in it, and does a fine job of managing this hostel. Nice!
About a quarter of the way into today's hike I come to Skyland Resort which is kind of a nicer wayside or restaurant. They have an expresso bar! You can order from the expresso bar in the restaurant, too, so I get a table in the corner which has wonderful views. I ask what kind of coffee they have and the lady says she'll check. A minute later a guy comes over with a bag of Royal Cup light/medium roast. I tell him SOLD! I'll have a cup of that and forget about the expresso bar. Next, food. I like the looks of the pot roast scramble and order that along with orange juice and a fruit cup. The food comes, but with fried eggs. Waiter Jose didn't even ask what kind of eggs I wanted! I tell him I want scrambled eggs. He come back in a few minutes. The kitchen only chopped up the fried eggs! Nope! New scrambled eggs please. He's back in a few minutes with a great breakfast. Fantastic!
While I'm enjoying this hike, sitting in the restaurant eating great food, this family comes in. Possibly foreign. Three kids. Rather well to do. I enjoy the banter. When I'm done, I encourage the parents, saying I really enjoyed sitting next to them, and that these are the best of times with young ones! My wife and I would love to go back and visit those days, if only for an hour.
When I leave the restaurant it is sleeting! Not good, as I left my wool hat and gloves back at the hostel. I make due with rain gear and waterproof mitts. I do have my down jacket if things get real cold. I'm fine, but it's definitely colder than forecasted. There's a freeze warning for tonight, too. Glad I'm not sleeping outside tonight.
To finish, I have to share something that may sound OCD about me. Leaves. You know, fall off trees in the fall? Well, my trekking poles are always getting leaves stuck on the pointed ends. It's distracting seeing them on the poles! So, every once in a while, I have to use my foot, while I'm still moving/hiking, to remove these hitch-hikers. You feel the same?

After I ordered and the cashier/cook starts making my sandwich, I notice he's making it as a fried egg! Scrambled, PLEASE, I interject, before it's too late! No problem, he says. Whew!

I used a shuttle about 4:30pm yesterday when I finished hiking to get to Bears Den Hostel. About to get checked-in when the shuttle driver Marie/Hopeful notices my Samaritans Purse bandana. Long story short is that her family hosts missionaries from time to time at their house.
So, instead of listening to fellow hikers snore the night away at the hostel, I've spent 2 great nights with a wonderful family that lives right next to the AT! I've been wonderfully blessed, to say the least! An old section of the AT actually goes right up to their backyard!
Today I finished hiking a section called the Roller Coaster. A series of up-downs over a ten mile part of the trail. 500' up, 500' down on each peak of the dozen peaks in this crazy section. Glad that's done! See the pic of the warning notice, with humor, of this section.
Met Captain Black today. His trail name comes from his pipe tobacco brand. No stove, yet he primarily eats oats and walnuts each evening? Hmmm.
Tim and Beth, I do appreciate your attention. Very much needed!
Dude, nice to hear from you, too!
Oh, thought I'd throw out a caution to those of you that might buy refilled iso-propane canisters for your hiking stoves. Thought I was getting a great deal, as the thing was heavier than any other canister. Turns out, it was accidentally over-filled. First time I used it, I get a huge fire ball about the size of a beach ball. Had to carefully adjust the valve while burning until I used enough of the fuel to bring the level down enough. Scary! Singed my cook pot cozy!
Off to Harper's Ferry tomorrow for the Flip-Flop Festival. That'll be a 16 mile day. Luckily, it's a pretty level ridge-line hike down to that town. However, that's not the real reason for going there. The main reason is that my dearest will be there! A very good reason for some zero mile days!

So, I thought since it's not hot, and not supposed to be thunder storming, why not hike? However, I did hear small amounts of thunder while hiking today. 
I had to be very careful in the rock fields today with the rain, especially stepping on those rocks with green moss or mold. Almost had my right foot slip out from under me at one point. I've come across three hikers that have had ended up with facial injuries because of falling in the rocks.
As the intensity of the rain increased, I ended up wearing my full rain suit. This helped keep me warmer, too.
Oh, I've come up with a simple solution to getting leaves off the points of my poles without having to use my foot. I just sweep the bottom of the pole against the brush along the side of the trail to remove the leaves.","PA Route 443 1181.9

The restaurant here won’t be open until 8 AM so I guess we’re going to Dunkin’ Donuts for coffee and a breakfast sandwich.
While I’m eating my breakfast sandwich and drinking my coffee at Dunkin’ Donuts I am trying to come up with how I’m going to get to the trailhead. I already know that the shuttle that is usually available for hikers is out of town for a few days. So I try Uber and Lyft without success. Neither have any cars available! So I guess it’s going to be a Carbon taxi.
I end up spending $40 to get to the Bake Oven Knob parking lot. I am on trail by 9 AM. Certainly not one of my earliest days!
The rocks are wet and very slippery right off the bat! I’m very careful.
About two hours in, a miracle happens! Trail magic! A previous thru hiker by the name of Fresh Ground is making all manner of tasty items on the side of the trail. He already has two customers, a young couple who I chat up and immediately like on first sight. I start out with a plate of excellent pasta salad followed by two cheese burgers, a cup of fresh ground brewed coffee, which is how our host got his trail name, and freshly sliced watermelon! Definitely a gift from God!
The only other notable thing that happens is going northbound through Lehigh gap. The climb out of the gap, at times, is almost a sheer rock, hand over hand climb. This, I actually enjoyed!
I continue to play leapfrog with the young couple through the remainder of my hiking day. 
The three of us all end at Small Gap. The young couple competes with each other over who is going to be the one to get a car to stop to give them a ride to the best place for chocolate shakes down the road apiece. They get their ride before mine comes.
I’m driven back to Bert’s to retrieve my extra equipment. I also grab something to go from the restaurant for dinner. Then it’s back to the B&B for laundry, a shower, and getting familiar with my new digs for the night.
I have a nice long conversation with Laurie, who was concerned about my welfare after having not heard from me for so long. Things are fine, once again.

I thought I better move right along or the young couple might pass me. After a couple hours I end up passing a young lady hiker named Zoom Zoom. This doesn’t happen very often for me. Then after only being on the trail a couple hours who do I meet but Fresh Ground handing out trail magic food again today! This time I am eating chicken tenders, green beans and potatoes, vegetables with ranch dressing for dip, and Kool-Aid of some red berry flavor. Soon Zoom Zoom shows up followed by the young couple. I'm on a mission today, so I finish eating, say my thanks, and goodbyes to all as I jump back on the trail.
I am in grind mode today so I concentrate on steady hiking to complete the 15.4 planned miles. I am done by 1:30 PM. That’s a pretty good hiking speed for an old duffer like me.
Seems the restaurants in wind gap are mostly closed today. However, I am able to con one of them that’s doing food prep for tomorrow into making me a chocolate shake.
Rather than wait for Kathy who owns the B&B to get out of work to pick me up, I decide to get a ride from an Uber back to the B&B. I’m just assuming it’s going to cost the same.

ROAM,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591553,"As my school teachers often admonished me, ""you have some explaining to do!"" Yes I do! 
Heartache. Plain and simple. You can't live long without your heart. My heart is not just in my chest. My wife and I will celebrate our 44th wedding anniversary this coming June 1st. This thru-hike would have been our longest separation since getting married. Shouldn't I have known this would happen? Maybe. If I had given that concept as much thought as which equipment to bring, sure! I'm not usually impulsive, but also not well known for my deep thinking abilities. So, NO, I didn't see this happening.
I've actually been moving in this direction of thinking for about two weeks now. Going home, that is. Never discussed this with my wife, Laurie. Maybe I thought she'd try and talk me out of coming home. We had several discussions on this topic before I started the hike, and what she would/should do if I wanted to come home. 
So, I floated a trial balloon on this topic with my daughter, about a week ago. I thought that baring my soul on this issue would open new avenues of communication with her. She would bring a woman's perspective to this topic. Plus, she and I have similar personalities, something she's not always been happy with LOL! 
Long story short, she said ""don't worry about what others might think!"" Well said, don't you think? That girl is smart! I/we have a tendency to be too concerned about that, don't I/we? Yup! Let's be honest, ok? Ok! 
So, late yesterday afternoon, as I'm relaxing, following 15.4 miles of hiking, too fast, thinking about what to do for dinner, seeing that the weather is not improving for hiking today, although rain trumps heat, in my book, I get an idea! You know, light bulb turns on? 
Why hike today? Why hike the last piece of Pennsylvania? I've already done at least 25% of the AT, over 500 miles, a minor achievement, relatively speaking. I'm thru most of what Pennsylvania rocks could do to me. Plus, Laurie thinks I'll be hiking today, so I'll be able to drive a rental car most of the way home before I have to answer any questions from her about today. I don't want to lie to her. Just surprise her! Flying is too costly to arrange at the last minute, and I'd have issues checking some of my hiking equipment, and still need a rental car to get home from the destination airport I fly to. 
The best part? This is all my idea. I'm coming to her. Not asking her to come get me. Laurie's been a peach thru this whole adventure. Cheering me on. Yet, I saw those tears in her eyes when she was leaving after our last visit. Yup. Saw those, dear. To be honest, I had tears, too, after talking with her several mornings ago. Guys, it's ok. Gals like guys who have real emotions. Never doubt that! 
It's been worth it. All of it! God has blessed beyond my ability to imagine, throughout this adventure. Countless events bear that out. 
To my prayer partners, known and unknown. Thank you! God answered your prayers. Without a doubt! 
To my family. Hope you're ok with this outcome. I am! Remember, it wasn't about completion? 
To my fellow hikers. I'm so impressed with your grit. Way beyond mine, for sure! Hang in there. We'll continue to follow your adventures and pray for you.

I was originally planning on doing this section May 22nd this year and then head home, but the rains came and I headed home a day early. Actually, it worked out better because I was driving home while Laurie thought I was hiking! She thought I was unavailable all day due to hiking ;) I'm reminded of an old saying ""Don't ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies!""
Today was hot at times, dry most of the time. I brought 2 liters of water. Missed a spring and skipped a shelter with water. Before I knew it I was rationing the few gulps I had left and was very dehydrated. I should have known better! How soon I/we forget! Learned my lesson again! About a mile from the finish I filtered a liter and downed it on the spot because I was so thirsty. I don't ever remember consuming 3 liters in one hiking day! 
Pennsylvania still has memorable rocks! Even this last section. That's ok. I've heard New Jersey has their own challenging rocks. At least at the beginning. 
Funny thing happened today. Part of the trail was on a service road. While I'm on it I hear a vehicle coming up behind me. It's a ranger. He asks me if this is the AT. I point my treking pole at a white blaze on a tree about 3 feet away. Hmmmm. Interesting! 
I watched a parasailer launch off a steep slope just after a tuna lunch break at the PA191 crossing around 1 pm today. Looks like fun!

He suggests Dan give him his car key and we'll drive his car to our spotted car, thus NOT needing Brian to shuttle us. This gets the couple the key they need. Only slight issue is they are 2 miles from our car and we're 4 miles from theirs. They will have to wait for us :(It's 90° this afternoon, humid, sunny. Very hot for 11.2 miles of hiking. Jimmy and I push thru, get Dan's car, drive to our spotted car, meet Dan and Marcia. Worked out fine!At dinner, Brian is still not 100% but thinks he can hike a shorter segment tomorrow. I'm having doubts. Here's the situation: Brian still has major lumbar issues, taking Imodium for trots, occasional fever issues; Jimmy has loose cartilage in left knee that causes lockups and pain on longer walks; weather forecast for coming week is 85-90° heat. Ok, I'll voice what I think is our only option, which nobody wants to do. GO HOME!!! Shock at first but all realize it's the smartest option. No one wants to be the reason for ending the adventure. I'm actually thrilled to see Laurie sooner than planned.My turn to sleep on the floor as we have 2 beds for 3 guys. Brian's watch alarm goes off at 5am, which he doesn't hear because of ear plugs he always wears. I decide it's time to hit the road. Another shower to wake me up, collect my things in the room, find Brian's car key, arrange stuff in both cars so only my stuff is in my car, and magically by 6am I'm ready to start home!","US Route 9D 1407.2

ROAM,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645375,"BIG uphill grind today!Met a SOBO speedster “NoBox” who’s name came from one of his grandkids who thought grandpa liked doing things “outside the box”! He’s just about done, and doing it in fine fashion!Met a pair of NoBox’s fellow hikers too. They told me that the SOBO approach is the RIGHT way to hike the AT because all the signs have it Maine to Georgia!?!?!? Well, since my sharing a shelter with this pair was less than deliteful because of their crazy sleeping habits, let’s leave the “right” way to hike the AT to each of our own opinions!!!","Sam’s Gap 319.7

ROAM,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645376,"Started hiking EARLY today after being awoke at 4:30 a.m. by a pair of SOBO crazies sharing the shelter. That’s right, very early! Putzed around eating and packing until 6:30 and decided I’d better start in the fog and dark with my trusty headlamp. Great experience! Next time I’ll stay in my tent far enough from the shelter to sleep, even though I would have had to pack a very wet tent! Being a light sleeper limits your options!After the sun cleared the views I was again astounded at the beauty of God’s creation!","Bald Mountain Shelter 327.4

ROAM,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645394,"This was one of my best days of hiking! Maybe THE best!!!I should share some info on my current hiking method. I call it “supported section hiking”. By supported I’m referring to my dear wife of 47 years. She’s my best friend, my personal advisor, my love, but by far, an unsung hero! I get to hike, she gets me there. When I’m thinking of doing something crazy, and I’m smart enough to ask her opinion, she shares her common sense, and I live to hike another day. She’s the reason I decided to switch to section hiking from my 2 month aborted attempt to thru-hike back in 2018. After 44 years of marriage, I couldn’t do the thru-hike thing.On trail today at 8:30am, done by 3pm. Sunny skies and NOT too hot, hills not unbearable, awesome fall colors. What’s not to like?Saw lots of SOBO hikers hurrying to make Springer before weather gets real cold.Great views of the Nolichucky River coming into Erwin TN.","Spivey Gap 333.1

ROAM,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645417,"Was strongly considering taking a zero today after looking at the weather report while listening to the rain outside:
Patchy fog before 2pm. Otherwise, mostly cloudy, with a high near 46. Northwest wind 11 to 13 mph, with gusts as high as 22 mph.
So, after shuttling up near the start, temp was 41F, raining, foggy, and very windy!
Oh, what the hey, let’s do a NERO!!!
Well, what do you know, I’m not the only crazy hiker out here today! Passed a NOBO couple with smiles even!
Yup, glad it was just a NERO!!!","Unaka Mountain Road 357.0

Always fun to pack up a wet tent!After an hour of hiking my right ankle started hurting causing me to favor it and walk funny. Another hour later in some rocks I fell and broke a plastic connector on my pack’s shoulder strap. Easy to fix but now I’m even more cautious. Most likely caused by my right ankle issue. Barely made it to Dalton. I hunker down at Hot Harry’s Burritos to find a room to dry out and determine the seriousness of my ankle injury. I manage to get a room at the Econo Lodge in Pittsfield and have a very difficult time getting there.
