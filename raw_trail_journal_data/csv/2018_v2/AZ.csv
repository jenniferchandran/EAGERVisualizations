When I summited Katahdin in August 2014 it was with very mixed emotions. On one hand I was excited to be complete an incredible journey that started 4 months earlier in Georgia, but on the other I was not wanting the trail lifestyle to end. I remember having my picture taken at the famous brown sign with me just standing there. Many hikers bring costumes and have poses all planned out and I am just standing there. The person with my camera gave me a hard time and told me to do something, so I did the typical stand on the sign supports with my arms outstretched. I was already thinking then that I wanted to do this again.

 

In 2015 and 2016 my wife and I travelled to Spain to walk the Camino which was also an awesome experience and one I was able to share with my wife. She loves the trail community and the walking but is not big on vertical and sleeping in the woods. The village to village walk of the various Caminos is perfect for her.

 

The AT had gotten into my system and the thoughts of going back were with me every day. In 2017 my wife had rotator cuff surgery in April, so no trips for her so I decided to head north from the CT/NY border in early July with the intention of going to Katahdin. As soon as I started it did not sit well with me that I had not started at Springer and even though I could relate with the thru hikers, I was not part of that year’s class. I called my wife and told her she should meet me in New Hampshire and we can do trail magic for a week before flying home to Phoenix. I did walk 300 miles last summer, but knew I wanted another go from Springer.

 

So now I plan to fly to Atlanta on April 28th and start walking north. Last time it took me 126 days, so with any luck, I should be standing on Katahdin on September 1st. My 30 year old son is planning to walk the first 500 miles with me so that is an added bonus. He has done a little mountaineering (Whitney, Rainier) with me, but he has never backpacked, so a new experience for him. He was born in New Hampshire and lived in Vermont before moving to Arizona when he was going into 4th grade, so walking through the southern Appalachian Mountains will be a brand new experience for him.",,View Entry,"Feb 20, Tue",0
AZ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584100,"Having thru hiked in 2014 I did upgrade two things for my section hike last summer. 
Gravity water filtering system. I still used a Sawyer mini, but it is so much easier having a gravity system.
NEMO air mattress. This is a bit noisier than the foam pads, but much more comfortable.

 

I have purchased a new tent, but the same model – Tarptent ProTrail. My son will be using my old one. It is 6 years old, but still in great shape. I also will be buying a new Gossamer Gear Mariposa backpack. My old one is also 6 years old and has 4,000 miles on it. I would use it again, but my son needs a pack.

 

I am a big fan of trail runners, not boots. I also like the non-waterproof versions. My feet get hot while hiking, so the more breathable, the better. In the 4,000 miles I have never had blister problems caused by my footwear. I purchase a size larger than normal and lace them very loosely. Footwear is a personal choice, but I have seen tons of foot problems caused by heavy boots. At a minimum I would suggest you buy your footwear at the end of a long day on your feet. The Salomon XA 3D PRO is my choice of footwear. They are breathable but have a sturdy bottom.

 

My base weight will be about 15 pounds not counting food and water. That includes a laptop as I have a small business that I will continue to take care of.

 

Food is one thing I have not figured out. I do eat the typical pasta sides and poptarts. I do not use drop boxes, just buy what is available at whatever store we happen to be near. Last time I started without a stove, but bought one in Damascus. I do like being able to cook, so will definitely be bringing the stove on this trip. This system is far from perfect, but again works for me.

AZ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584150,"This past weekend we (5 of us) did our annual trek to the Grand Canyon. We started down the South Kaibab trail about 7:45 on Saturday under cloudy cool conditions. It was great having the clouds. It changes the lighting in the Canyon. Normally we have a bright blue sky with a warm sun on the exposed trek down to the river. My 30 year old son (who will be hiking the first 500 miles of the AT with me) joined us this year. ABear, who I met on the trail in 2014, did his 5th Canyon hike with us. Always fun hanging out with previous thru hikers. He and I hiked 600 miles together in 2014.As we were heading up Bright Angel the rains could be seen coming across the Canyon. Just minutes after we reached the cover of the Bright Angel Lodge at the top the rains started. The temperatures had dropped into the low 40s, so cold by our Phoenix standards. The total hike is 16.5 miles with a 5,000 foot drop to the Colorado River.On Sunday the plan was to climb 12,635' Humphreys Peak about 80 miles south on the Canyon. Our room at the Ski Lift Lodge was at about 7,000 feet where it rained most of the night. The snow line was at 8,000', the ski area base lodge (where we normally park) is at 9,500', so all snow there. Since visibility was zero and the forecast called for winds up high we decided to go lower for our Sunday hike. We headed down Oak Creek Canyon to the west branch of the Oak Creek at about 5,300'. It is a beautiful hike with scenery that most people would not expect to see in Arizona. See the picture under my photos. It was misty the entire time, so often we could not see the tops of the canyon walls.A very fun weekend. I am looking forward to getting my thru hike started, unfortunately it is still over 6 weeks away. Hopefully the weather in the east will settle down by then. It certainly will be warmer.Probably will not be writing much before I leave. I will do my best to update daily once on the trail.",,View Entry,"Mar 14, Wed",0
AZ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586863,"I have a new fan club for this year’s hike. My 87 year old mother volunteers at an “old folks home” in her hometown in Vermont. Several of the residents there were very interested when my mom brought up I was hiking from Georgia to Maine. She has printed out a map of the AT so they can follow my progress this summer. My mom is very good on a computer so she will be able to show them my pictures and updates.

My base weight will be about 18 pounds not counting food and water. That includes a laptop as I have a small business that I will continue to take care of. I was extremely careful of weight in 2014. This year I will probably be a couple pounds heavier with extra food. During my section hike I carried more as it gives you more options of skipping a town, or just able to eat more. I lost 25 pounds of body weight last time and expect the same this time. My heaviest item is the laptop (39 oz) followed by my pack (33), sleeping bag (30) and my tent (26). These 4 items are almost half my total weight. That said, they are all very light weight compared to equipment of just 20 years ago. 
 

Food is one thing I have not figured out. I do eat the typical pasta sides, poptarts and lots of salty snacks. I do not use drop boxes, just buy what is available at whatever store we happen to be near. Last time I started without a stove, but bought one in Damascus (450 miles in). I do like being able to cook, so will definitely be bringing the stove on this trip. This system is far from perfect, but again works for me. 
 

My son and I have our flights booked for Saturday April 28th to Atlanta. Survivor Dave will pick us up and bring us to Amicalola Falls State Park. We hope to do a few miles of the approach trail that evening. My son has till May 31st, so his goal is to get past the 500 mile mark in the 33 days.

I realized this morning that this will be my seventh time leaving to hike 200+ miles. It has been a hectic few weeks though between our tenants giving us notice they will be leaving our rental house, to my son getting married last weekend, getting summoned for jury duty on Monday of this week (fortunately I was part of the last cut) and getting ready to run my business remotely for 4 months. All seems on track. A big thank you to all my employees, the staff I work with at NXP and of course a huge thank you to my wife, Elizabeth, for her support in running things while I am gone. Without her help I could not do this hike. She has no interest in hiking the AT, but does love the hiking community. We do plan to do our third Camino next summer.
Elizabeth plans to travel east 2 or 3 times to meet me at various locations along the trail. She already has a supply of goodies to provide trail magic. 
Saturday morning our son and I are flying from Phoenix to Atlanta. We will take the metro to the northern most station where Survivor Dave will pick us up and bring us to Amicalola State Park. With any luck we will do the first few miles of the approach trail that evening. In 2014 I forgot to sign in at Springer so I was not part of the starting statistics. I was number 259 to sign in at Katahdin in mid August.
I will do my best to have daily posts once we get started this weekend. Thanks for following along.",,View Entry,"Apr 26, Thu",0
AZ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588306,"Today started with an early morning ride to the Phoenix airport. It was off to Atlanta, then an hour MARTA train ride to the North Springs station where Survivor Dave picked us up and brought us to Amacalola State Park. I signed in as thru hiker 2445. At 5pm Cooper and I had our photo taken at the famous arch and we were on our way. The Amacalola falls were beautiful, much more impressive than I expected. 
We hiked 4.2 miles to the top of Frosty mountain where we set up for the night. Tomorrow we have 4 miles more of the appreach trail before we reach the summit of Springer Mountain and the official start to our journey. 
Fun side note. The guy who took our photo at the arch saw my Camino patch and asked if I had walked it. (Yes 2015 and 2016) He lives in Germany and walked from his house to Santiago, then walked home taking a longer way. He is starting his AT home tomorrow. He has a Camino tatoo.",,View Entry,"Apr 28, Sat",0
AZ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588460,"Survived the first night out. It was quite windy and with no leaves on the trees (we are at 3,400') the wind was blowing right through our campsite. The temp is 44, so cold for me. 
We were hiking at 7:30 with Gooch mountain shelter our goal, 19.9 miles ahead. 4.2 miles we reached Springer Mountain, the official start of our journey. The day was beautiful, cool, breezy and sunny. At Springer we met Squirrel, a triple crown hiker. His friend had just started her second AT thru hike. She also was born and raised in Vermont. I hope to catch her, but she has a 6 mile head start and is a fast hiker.
Today we saw lots of hikers, mostly the section variety. None of the thru hikers I met have plans for a 4 month hike. At 5pm we rolled into our destination for tonight. There are lots of people here.
Our goal tomorrow is 15.4 miles to Neels gap. Pizza, shower and a real bed await. That is a great motivator.","Springer

AZ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588517,"Another beautiful weather day. Today was 15.4 miles finishing the day with a climb over Blood Mountain, the high point of Georgia at almost 4,500'. Being a Monday the trail was quite a bit quieter. I am surprised how few thru hikers we are seeing. The ones that say they are headed to Maine will need to pick up their pace. We met a couple ladies who are on day 7 of their journey and taking two days off now. We have yet to meet someone who is planning a 4 month hike.
Our stop point today is Neels Gap. We rented a cabin just down the road from the trail crossing. No laundry or restaurant but a shower and queen bed. We did rinse a few things off and have them hanging out to dry.
We did meet a fellow trail journalist, FarFar. He did a few hundred miles north of here already. He will skip that going north. This way he misses the biggest crowds but still gets the NOBO experience and finishes at Katahdin.","Gooch Mountain 
",Neels Gap,"Apr 30, Mon",15.40
AZ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588742,"Last night was was nice. We decided to go for a cabin so we each got a nice bed and were able to spread our stuff out and reorganize a bit. We even had a 12"" TV to watch. We both started with way too much food so a few items will go in the hiker box here.
My posts have been short as I am not a writer and need to get into the flow of things. Cooper is having a great time so far. I have told him this is the toughest part as we are not in trail shape and not used to sleeping on the ground. The trail is great and the Georgia mountains are beautiful. There is plenty of water. The leaves are out on the trees below 3,000' but just budding up higher so as we walk every day we see the forest in different stages of spring.
At Gooch mountain shelter we watched a couple squirrels playing 50' above the ground, running from limb to limb. If the leaves had been in bloom we would have missed the whole show. Cooper heard an owl so he went on a search expedition. He ended up getting within 15 feet and the owl never flew away. He got some great pictures.
Today we are getting a late start since we are taking 3 days to get to Hiawasee. The store opens at 9, so we will buy a few things and head north once again.
We hit up the store for supplies and a couple hot pockets. We took our time and left just before 10 AM. Today was great in that we are starting to meet some thru hikers. This afternoon we hiked back and forth with Coach. He is camping with us tonight at a random spot on the side of the trail. 
The goal tomorrow is 17 miles leaving 6 to the road to Hiawassee on Thursday.","Neels Gap

AZ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588829,"We did well picking our spot for last night. The guide books do not show all the tenting spots so we were looking at a topo map trying to pick a flat area. It worked. As I write this we just passed Tray mountain and are hanging out for a bit. Last time I was here it was raining and in the 40s, today sunny and 80. The leaves are not out yet so lots of sun.
Today has been fun, continuing to meet other through hikers. Coach has been with us. Today we met Cables who used to live in Ashville, NC running a food truck. Coop had fun chatting with him. Cooper continues to love the cold mountain water we are drinking.
We finished our day at Sassafras Gap. A total of 17.1 miles for the day. There are lots of tenters here (10). Great for socializing. Coop has been into having a camp fire, so tonight he picked up the trail name Fuego, Spanish for fire.","Random campsite

I am writing this from the patio of Barney's in Hiawasee waiting for our burgers to be delivered. Salad was delivered so it is now 5 hours later (5pm).
 We had a 6.3 mile walk from our tenting spot to the road crossing. We made great time, plenty of motivation as this is our first town since we started last Saturday. We are treating ourselves to the Holiday Inn. We have 2 queens and a pull out couch for Coach. Tomorrow we have a full breakfast included and an 8am pickup for the return to the woods.
Right next door is an awesome grocery store, even by non trail standards it is great. We have been there twice so far. I just ate my second salad of the day. We plan on ordering pizza for dinner and watching some basketball. We have a real TV this time.
Cooper spent time this afternoon cruising the town including going down to the lake. Back in the 1940s the government and the TVA built a big dam creating the lake.
Tomorrow we enter North Carolina so we will be done our first state. Georgia has been awesome, mountains, people and this time the weather as well. Last night I called for a ride for today and enjoyed the phone conversation. Today we had a great ride down the hill into town with Joyce. She is my age and a paddler. She grew up only a few miles from where coach lives in Florida. Both enjoyed sharing stories.","Sassafras Gap

Today was 16.7 miles and well over 5,000 vertical of climbing up to Standing Indian shelter. We are actually tenting by a stream .2 miles north of the shelter. Somehow we lost Coach today. We crossed into North Carolina and had lunch with him. 
At lunch we discussed going another 2 miles to the top of Standing Indian Mountain. We reached the shelter about 5pm and decided we had had enough for today. The last couple miles and 1,000 vertical will wait for tomorrow.

AZ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589213,"We had a nice camping spot last night by a small stream. This morning we were up at 6:30 and walking by 7:15. Once we got up on the ridge we had cell reception and I got a note from Coach, he had tweaked a muscle and gotten a shuttle out of the woods and will be taking a couple days off.
Yesterday we had debated hiking the extra 2 miles to the summit. Glad we didn't as there were 25 people up there when we went through. Oh yeah, it is a weekend, lots of people around.
Our plan was 19.5 to Rock Gap Shelter. Midday we got to thinking with all the people, the shelter being close to a parking lot and it being not a great spot we may as well go the extra .2 and get a ride into town. When we arrived at the parking lot there was a gentleman handing out ice cold Budweisers, our first trail magic. There was a shuttle driver there so we threw our packs in his car and met him .6 miles up the trail at another road crossing. That brought our total to 20.4 for the day.
Today we were over 5,000 feet twice and I don't think we ever went below 4,000 feet. The climb up Mt Albert early afternoon was steep but short. There is a fire tower at the top. Other than that short stretch the trail today was fantastic.","Standing Indian Shelter

Last night turned out great. Tracks was with us. We got a private room at Baltimore Jack's hostel. Tracks got a bunk. Two other hikers we know showed up a few minutes later. Tracks took off with them to get some supplies. Fuego and I walked over to the local brewpub, The Lazy Hiker. They had a couple food trucks in their parking lot but we wanted to sit down to eat so we changed locations. There were no places to eat and watch the playoffs.
We got a few things for breakfast and a few beers. Tracks came over to our room and watched basketball with us. I was very productive with work. I got a new small project this week including a new employee. The next 2 nights we will be in fun places and very little privacy so it is nice to be caught up. (Thanks for the help Nathan)
We are both feeling great. No muscle issues or blisters. I have always felt the first week was the toughest, then your body gets stronger so we are in a good spot. Today marks the beginning of our second week.
I am thinking of becoming a trail vegetarian and consuming my meat in town. Tuna and sausage are the popular trail proteins and neither really strikes my fancy.
Ron Haven gave us a 9am ride back up the hill. He has been supporting thru hikers for years. He told lots of great stories during the 20 minute ride.
We hiked 14.7 miles today and didn't see a single thru hiker and only 1 section hiker. Early on there was a pack of weekend warriors, but we basically had the trail to ourselves. 
Tonight we are staying at Nantahala Mountain Lodge. It is a beautiful spot. They started catering to thru hikers and now go more for section hikers that have a bit of money. Cooper loves it here. The place is immaculate. Dinner was great, laundry is done, invoices sent, so now a bit of relaxing and probably an early night to bed.","Franklin

When I was packing up this morning I realized my thru hiker tag and my Camino patch were missing. I had seen them yesterday afternoon. I looked around the hostel with no luck. When we were dropped off I went to where I had been yesterday and there in the grass lay my patches. Sweet. So far 2 people have recognized the Camino patch, so a good conversation starter.
After a great breakfast Steve brought us back to the trail. Last night Coop had seen a bald eagle fly right up the dirt road we were staying on. Steve showed us the fish farm where the nesting pair go for dinner. It was just like fishing in a barrel.
The trail today had a few climbs. One of the peaks had an open fire tower with incredible views. A section hiking couple arrived just after us. On the way down we blew past the only water in a 10 mile stretch, oops. 
The NOC is a fun stop. We arrived at 2pm and had lunch overlooking the river. Tracks texted us and he is on his way to the NOC. Also heard from Coach. He is off for a week or two but still plans to head north to Katahdin.

Last night was great at the NOC. We had a bunk room off a common area so a bunch of us watched the playoffs. Tracks is still with us. He is from San Diego and a PCT thru hiker. It is amazing to me how few thru hikers are around. There are section hikers but none moving close to our place so we see them once.
Today was a big climbing day with Jacob's Ladder near the end of the day. We are getting stronger. Fuego is going great. It is so nice to have him able to do this pace and not have any problems. Right before our last climb we passed a road crossing. A half mile before we got there I mentioned to Fuego that 4 years ago there were apples and oranges on a picnic table. Sure enough today there were apples. Thank you to whoever's been leaving the fresh fruit.
The leaves have really been coming out now. The warm sunny weather has the forest really coming to life. 
Tomorrow we have only 11 miles to Fontana. There is a nice lodge there that offers great deals to hikers. It is the southern gateway to the Smokey mountains.","NOC

AZ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589683,"We survived the rain. It only rained for an hour or so, just enough to soak everything. Tracks and I had all our stuff organized and in our tent before the rain. Fuego learned a good lesson about preparing as some of his stuff got wet. We are in the clouds this morning so 100% humidity. Even though it isn't raining the trees are still dripping water.
We have almost zero food. It is fun having the light pack. Yesterday was another day where we had to watch our water. We had planned to hitchhike into a town but ended up not doing it. This meant we went over 9 miles with no water on the trail. 
We were random camping last night (not in a designated spot) so the ground was quite uneven. I slept ok, but much prefer being level. With the rains we were in our tents by 7:30.
We had a couple climbs today then a long downhill into Fontana. We got the shuttle to the lodge and immediately pulled out all of our wet stuff so it could dry. It is nice having the afternoon to get stuff done, eat, shop for the next few days, laundry rest, etc.
So we cruised down to a grill and had a good lunch then off to the laundromat. What an entertaining 3 hours. There were 6 other hikers there, all characters. It was very entertaining. There was a young lady here who just was hiking in New Zealand with Schroomer, a buddy of mine from 2014. 
Tomorrow we head up into the Smokey Mountains and enter Tennessee. The goal is 16 miles. No camping in the Smokeys, so we may end up in our first shelter. If the shelter is full, then you can camp.","Brown Fork Gap

The Fontana dam is the largest east of the Mississippi, 480' high and 1/2 mile wide. We walk across the dam then it is into the Smokey Mountain national park. That is when the climb started. With the rains this morning the humidity was very high. We were drenched in sweat.
Once up on the ridge there was nice walking. We arrived at a shelter about 3:30. Literally a couple minutes later a thunderstorm rolled through with heavy rain. We were under cover so we waited for the rains to stop. Thirty minutes later we were on our way. 
By the time we reached our destination the sun was out. Now at 6pm there isn't a cloud in the sky. Since we are in the smokeys we have to stay in a shelter, a first for this trip.

The shelter was half full, good crew. Besides Tracks there were 3 other thru hikers who we had met the day before the laundromat. There were also a few section hikers. We are 9 miles into our day as I write this. I think we all have the same plan for today.
Tracks arrived at our end for the day a few minutes before us. Shortly after Jawz and GQ arrived. It is now a bit after 5pm and not a section hiker in sight. We were told this shelter was sold out (14 people) for tonight. We are only 2.8 miles from the Clingmans Dome parking lot so there is a chance a group will head here after their work.
The hike today was fairly uneventful as we bounced along the ridge. We are currently at 5,500 feet.
Most of the crew from last night showed up. Still only a few section hikers. Several of us are tenting even though technically we should be in the shelter. It is a beautiful evening. We are planning an early start tomorrow to maximize our time in Gatlinburg.","Russell Field Shelter

Our day started with finishing the climb to the top of Clingmans Dome, the high point of the AT. It is about 400 feet higher than Mt Washington in NH. FYI- MT Mitchell in North Carolina is the high point east of the Mississippi. On the summit is an observation tower to bring you above the trees. With the wind it was quite chilly.
From the summit is was about 8 miles to Newfound Gap where we stopped for the day. We got a ride down the mountain into Gatlinburg. Food shopping is done. I went to the outfitter and got new shorts. I had a 12"" tear in my old ones that I sewed a few days ago.

Initially our goal was 18 to Standing Bear. We have a great group of 6 going. Tracks, Finger Lickin, Jawz and MF Mouse. Part way through today we decided to stop at Standing Bear to eat some food then move up the mountain 2 miles.
Finger Lickin, Fuego and I completed 16 miles by 1pm. We took a long break by a beautiful stream. We only had 1.7 miles to SB where we took another long break. It is very warm down low. Mid morning we were at 6,200' and early afternoon we were at 1,500'. We are now back over 3,000' tonight.

This morning we started with a 2 mile 1,200' vertical climb. At the top we stopped for breakfast. We were already drenched in sweat even though it wasn't even 8am.
We then continued with the ups and downs typical of walking the AT. Part way through the day Fuego was frustrated not realizing how much climbing we had today. We stopped for lunch and water and he was good to go. As we were going over Max Patch Bald he was saying how this was the most awesome stretch of trail yet.
We finished our 18 mile day on top of Walnut Mountain. All afternoon the sky was filled with thunder but we avoided the rain. We arrived at the shelter before 4pm. The shelter is really small and Fuego passed on a shelter spot, a decision I think he came to regret as the rains moved in.
We cooked our dinner at 4 and it is now almost 6. There are about 10 tents set up and everyone is huddled in for the night. It is also quite cold. I am very glad I grabbed a spot in the shelter.
I also messed up in Gatlinburg and charged my phone and laptop on an outlet that wasn't working so they both charged but drained my battery so both our phones are running low. Oh well. We will be in town tomorrow.","

On the trail if you want to do bigger miles the goal is to due 12 by 12, 12 miles by 12 noon. 2 days ago we did 16 by 1, so we must have done it. Yesterday we did 11.5 by noon going uphill. Today we finished the 13.6 by 11:30. Fuego was happy.
The motel we wanted to stay at in Hot Springs is closed, so we were cruising the town looking for a place. Things are surprisingly expensive here. After 4 tries we settled on the Creekside Cabins. It is a great place, right behind 2 restaurants. The rain has stopped so we are all hanging out by the river sharing stories.

We went to dinner 100 feet from our place and had a great meal. Several others joined us. At one point someone asked me why I am doing the AT a second time. My answer was nights like tonight, the comradery of a great group. I also told about my favorite bumper sticker:
The Appalachian trail, the best experience of my life, interrupted by long walks through the woods.
The waitress asked where we were from. The answer - Arizona, New Hampshire, California, Alabama, Ohio, Australia and New York. 
Today was cloudy all day with very high humidity. A couple times it started to rain but never came down hard. We had a fair amount of climbing so I was drenched all day. We saw 2 other thru hikers besides Tracks and Finger Lickin.
About 14 miles in we stopped at Mom's store to get an ice cream and a soda. The place is hard to describe. It had a freezer and a fridge, a few couches with locals smoking on them and a whole bunch of junk. Enough said. 
We had to call for a ride 5 miles before our stop because of no cell service. We showed up at 4:10 for a 4:30 pickup. The hostel is right on a steam. They have food for sale which is nice as well. It is just after 6 and all kinds of people are streaming in. We are sitting on the patio right over the stream. Just finished a pizza and now eyeing some ice cream.

All 5 mentioned it was the best nights sleep of the trip. We had a fan running and were right next to a stream and all the windows were open.
There were about 12 people there for the night. In the morning it was still raining, nice to have been inside and dry. We were dropped off just before 8 for a 19.8 mile day. The rains stopped about noon. It was actually nice for walking, keeping the temperature down.
We finished walking just after 4. There are four of us headed to another hostel. Fuego is an honorary member of the over 50 club. The other 3 of us are 50+ and want to sleep out of the rain. Tomorrow night we don't really have an option to stay indoors and the forecast is for rain again.
It is 6pm and we are waiting for the spaghetti to be ready. We are showered and dry. We have a creekside cabin so we will have the sound of water all night.
Tomorrow it is walking north again. If we don't run into Tracks, Finger Lickin and Mouse, we should see them in Erwin on Sunday. They are probably 3 miles behind at a shelter. It was 9 miles to the next one and with all the rain around they probably set up there for the night.","Log Cabin Gap

She was ""I want to stay there"". Then I told her the cabin had a bunk bed and mattresses, that's it. No chairs, linens, table. The bathroom is 150' away and up a hill. She wasn't as excited then. Thru hiker standards are quite a bit different. It is much nicer than my tent, and yes it did rain again last night. Today's forecast includes a flood watch for the area. Hopefully we miss that part. It is for random storms but the ground is so saturated and the streams are already very high.
Our time to get shuttled to the trail this morning is dependent on the royal wedding. The husband is at trail days in Damascus and the wife is into the wedding. Once again these hostels have wonderful people running them. Jawz is with us. He has also invested well so he quit his job to hike the trail. He will get another job when he finishes. It was great hearing him talk money yesterday, same philosophy as me, live below your means and invest.
Last night was our third night in a row being right on a stream/river. I slept well again. We left the door open so we had the fresh air and sound of rumbling water. 
We started the day dry but since we were in the clouds the sweat glands kicked in. It started raining soon after so it kept things cool. Late morning we could here the rains coming toward us. For 5 five minutes it rained as hard as I have ever seen. It was an instant soaking and the trail was a stream.
Today was another big climbing day. With about a mile to go to we were on top of Big Bald Mountain, 5,500 feet. There were 3 sisters on top. Mouse and I were the first up so they gave us each an apple. Those behind us were not as fortunate. 
While enjoying the views the sun tried to come out, then the thunder started. We could see the rain coming so we packed up in a hurry and took off up the trail to the protection of the shelter. The shelter fits 10 and at 4pm as I write this there are 8 of us here. Our group of 6 plus 2 we know, so a good group. Two more showed up to get us to 10.

The morning had the typical ups and downs. There was tons of water early and then a dry finish into Erwin. We did not get any rain during the day which was nice. The humidity was very high in the woods so I was drenched all day.
Once in town we all collected at Uncle Jonnys. Fuego and I got a ride to Walmart where there is a Mexican restaurant as well. After a great meal we hit up Walmart to get food for the next few days.

Trail days ended in Damascus yesterday so a bunch of people returned to Erwin so today could be quite busy on the trail. Today is another big climbing day but after this the trail gets easier.
The morning started cloudy with 100% humidity. Today was a short day, but had 5,000 feet of climbing. Fuego was in a good mood as we charged up the hill. Mouse had started a bit before us, Finger Lickin right after. Tracks had to go to the post office, so hopefully he will still make it here. Jawz is taking a rest day so probably will not see him again. 
Mid day we came to a road crossing. A woman was there with cold Gatorade. Always appreciated.
Our target was the summit of Unaka. It is the first northern spruce forest and it is just on the very top. It makes for a great tenting area but there is not water around. As we are getting water 2 miles before the summit the thunder starts. Then the rain moved in. Fuego and I each carried 4 liters which is 8 pounds. Fuego carried up left over pizza and 2 beers for dinner tonight. Plus we have hot dogs with rolls this time.
Tracks showed up as we were trying to start a fire in the rain. It took a while but eventually we got a nice fire going then the rains stopped.

We all were out of camp by a little after 7. The trail was good but with lots of ups and downs. The middle days are always tough to stay motivated. Heading out of town you have clean clothes and are well fed. Days going into town are great because you are looking forward to a shower, laundry and food. The middle days you put on yesterday's wet dirty clothes and walk north to an unspecified destination. 
Today stayed dry while hiking. We were above 4,000' the entire day so not too hot. About 4pm we rolled into our camp spot. The sky started getting dark so we immediately set up tents. Good thing because it started raining at 4:30. I haven't counted but I think this is 8 days in a row with rain. It sure would be nice to stay dry for a day.
At one of the road crossings we met Shannon. Her family runs Mountain Harbor hostel where we plan to stay tomorrow. We chatted with her for over 30 minutes.

It is known for having the best breakfast on the trail. Fresh baked pastries and several options for main course. All you can eat.
The weather was dry last night and the forecast is good for the next 24 hours.
The trail has been busy since Erwin. There is a bit of competition for sleeping space on the trail. Every shelter has been full. Today did stay dry and it is a beautiful evening now. We are tenting about 2 miles short of the shelter. Our area is full and lots of people were headed to the shelter. 
Today was an off day hiking for us. Fuego and I both like hiking early. This morning breakfast was at 8. We both over ate then left at 9 to walk the half mile to the trail. 6 miles in there was a beautiful river. We ended up staying there well over an hour. Yesterday we had over 13 miles by noon, today only 6. At the river stop there was a steady stream of other hikers going through. All day we had a hard time getting motivated. I guess 16.7 miles is still pretty good for an off day.
The terrain was fairly easy with gentle ups and downs. There was plenty of water all day. With all the rain the streams are really flowing well.
Every night we hang out food bags on trees out of the reach of bears. Tonight there are no good places to hang out food. Ours are the best of the group so if a hungry bear does wander through here tonight hopefully he goes for one of the section hikers bags as they are not really protected. We also have Terra the German Shepherd with us so just her presence will keep unwanted visitors away. 
Camping with us are Mouse and Tracks. Finger Lickin headed to the shelter. David and Racoon are both here. We have known them for about a week. There are also 4 section hikers here. Even though the weather is good we have all gone to our tents by 7. The plan is to get an early start tomorrow. 
As far as critter sightings there haven't been many. No bears, a few deer, some turkeys, a mink, several snakes but none poisonous and tons of squirrels and chipmunks. I have only stayed in 3 shelters so far and there were mice in one of them. We have seen 1 box turtle and he was on top of a mountain. Now that the forest is in full bloom the birds are out.

We were 5 miles from the trail and I was about to call about a shuttle when a guy from a local hostel pulls in with a pickup truck. We all hopped in the back. Perfect timing. 
We hung out at the hostel for awhile then headed out for a 9 mile hike to our shelter for the night. The first 6 miles are closed for camping due to bear activity. We joked the locals probably feed the bears to get people to stay in town. 
Everything worked out great. There are only 4 of us here. Today was dry but the forecast is for rain all day tomorrow so we are all in the shelter. Only the third time Fuego has stayed in one. This sets us up well as we only have 33 miles to Damascus. A long day tomorrow and a short day into town.

It started to rain hard. 7 miles in we reached the next shelter. There were several people there who had not left yet. Our plan for the day was 22.7 miles, our biggest day yet. This would leave us just over 10 into Damascus. 
When we reached the second shelter which was 14.5 miles in it was still pouring hard. I arrived a few minutes ahead of Fuego. When he arrived he asked can we just keep going all the way to Damascus, 33 miles total. So that became our new goal. We had done 14.5 by 12:45 and now we had 18.5 to go. We passed our original goal at 4pm. That would have been a good day but now we had another 10 to go. By now the rains had stopped but we were still drenched and sweating like crazy.
We ended up getting into town a little after 7. We crushed the first 8 of the extra 10 and then slowed down for the last couple miles. So 33 miles in just under 13 hours is an average of over 2.5 miles per hour. We only took 4 breaks all day. Finger Lickin and Mouse got into town a bit after us. We are not sure where they are staying. Terra made it as well. That is a long day for a German Shepherd. Mouse plans on taking two days off here.

I then had time to do my invoices and payroll , so that is now all taken care of. It is 2:30. Tracks sent us a text, he is almost into town.

About half way up is the Creeper Trail Cafe.

Fuego had a tough day. All along he has had a thru hiker attitude. Today it was clear he only has 2 more days so it makes tolerating the wet a bit harder. He has accomplished everything he hoped. We are past the 500 mile mark.
We did go through the Grayson Highlands, so that means ponies. Visibility was never over 100 feet so I was afraid we may miss them. Then we saw a single pony so we headed off trail to get closer. There were actually 5 adults and two babies. We all (Fuego, Finger Lickin and I) were able to pet them. The mommy pony gave me a kiss. Finger Lickin took a photo so hopefully I can get it from her in a day or so. That put us all in a better mood.

It is $.50 a person, great deal for the hikers. It helps the local businesses as it makes it easy to get to town.
We started hiking about 9 under cloudy skies. The forecast was ffor afternoon showers. We were hoping we could finish the 11.5 miles before the rains. You can tell our confidence is high as we left with empty water bottles knowing we had over 6 miles to water. We brought a couple snacks and that was it. Super light. The first 6 miles was all high on a ridge so the trail was nice and dry.
We arrived at the water in 2 hours, got some water and ate some snacks. Only 5 miles to go. There is an old one room schoolhouse right on the trail. There was a sign indicating there was trail magic. We have not seen any trail magic this trip since we are late for thru hikers. Our first concern was it was an old sign. Turns out there were 2 coolers full of ice cold drinks and a big box of snacks and another box with miscellaneous supplies. There were two hikers there when we arrived. By the time we left there were probably 12. 
While we were sitting inside the rain started, quite hard. Not knowing how long it would rain we took of to finish our last 2.7 miles. We were now in much lower terrain with lots of clay which was super slick. I did fall once, my second fall of the hike. After about 30 minutes the rain stopped but everything was soaked. We were walking through fields so the wet grass drenched our shoes. Oh well. Fitting that Fuego would finish in the rain. He did 545 miles in 33 days.

Fuego had fun as well. Lots of familiar faces as well as new ones. After the initial group, we moved on to a river crossing a bit south. It was fun driving through the beautiful Virginia countryside. We spent an hour at the river with zero hikers. 
We decided to head back to Marion. On the way we saw 2 hitch hikers at the Mt Roger's visitor center. We only had room for 1 so we gave the second guy food. He was good with that. We dropped off the guy at the Travel Inn where we stayed the past 2 nights. Brenno and Half Full were there. They told us Tracks was at the Chinese restaurant in the Walmart plaza. So we dash over there and did some trail magic in the parking lot.
The plan was then to drop Finger Lickin off and head to the 1 room schoolhouse. She wanted to go as well so off we went. Within 10 minutes of arriving there were 8 more hikers. They finished off the ice cream which was great as it was quite soft by now. Elizabeth was very happy the ice cream was such a big hit. She brought all kinds of toppings and sauces from Phoenix.

Always fun meeting people with different backgrounds. We chatted with them for a while and as they left 2 young ladies arrived. It was a great morning. 
We then hiked the 4 miles back to the car and did a bit of trail magic for 4 hikers. It was then off to lunch at the much anticipated Homeplace Restaurant. It is a 1907 farmhouse that serves all you can eat family style dinners. You get fried chicken and either beef or ham. For an extra dollar you can get both beef and ham. You also get an array of side dishes. It was very good and a beautiful setting. 
Now it was 1 mile back up the hill to the trailhead to see if we could get rid of the rest of our food. No problem. A stream of hikers came through. I fired up the fry pan and cooked the remaining eggs. The remaining food went quickly. Several of the hikers ate with us then hitchhiked to the Homeplace. As we were about to leave 2 hikers wanted a ride so we drove them to the Homeplace where we saw several familiar faces. Elizabeth had a great time again with the hiker community. Several hikers were asking about the Camino. We always love talking about Spain.
Tomorrow Elizabeth will drop me in Pearisburg where I will head north. I should be hiking over McAfee Knob again next Thursday. After dropping me off, she will be off to Roanoke to catch a flight to Charlotte then on to Phoenix. I will continue north going solo for the first time as Fuego is now back home in Phoenix. We met a lot of nice people today so I will probably see some of them up the trail a bit.","Daleville

We had a great few days together. For me it was back to hiking north after a 3 1/2 day break. Full disclosure - I did skip a section of trail. This was for many reasons. I really want to finish in August. Missing this time would put pressure on me to make up time. Next weekend is also a payroll weekend and this area is very remote. I will now be back in Daleville to do payroll next weekend. 
The weather today was spectacular, not a cloud to be seen. I met a few new hikers and ran into Smurf again. He had jumped ahead a couple weeks ago. I also hiked with Giant for 40 minutes. He started May 4th and plans to be done mid August. He lives in Tempe, only a few miles from where I live. Today is his 23rd birthday.

The shelter is theoretically closed because of dead trees in the area. All the signs are dated Jan 2017 and all the dead trees have been cut down. 
Today was one of thosethose days that was hard. I did hike 22 miles with 2 big climbs and 2 steep descents but it just seemed harder than it should have been. It is also the first day I walked by myself the entire day. Yesterday I walked with Giant for a bit and Smurf.
I am currently tenting with 5 other thru hikers by a big oak tree in the corner of a cow pasture. One guy started a week behind me, the others are all at least 3 weeks longer to get here. One guy is my age, the others are all in their 20s.
I almost stayed at a shelter 4 miles back because there were 7 people there, all 55 and older. 
Unfortunately Giant was not feeling well. I passed him about lunch time. He was going to take a nap at the shelter. He lives only a few miles from me in Phoenix. Yesterday was his 23rd birthday. He never did go by me this afternoon.","Pine Swamp Branch shelter

One of the young males was standing right in the middle of the path. I stopped and started talking to him, but he just stood there staring me down. I started moving slowly toward him and he finally moved out of my way. I was within 50 feet so I was relieved he gave up his ground.
Tha day started with a thousand foot climb, perfect to get the sweat glands going. I was feeling OK, nothing is bothering me, just curious as to why yesterday seemed so hard. Once on the ridge it was quite rocky. No problem, just a lot slower. Still pretty quiet on the hiker front. I did meet two guys today, one started April 10, the other in March.
Last night I did have a discussion with guys I camped with about finish dates. They have calculated that if they average 15 miles a day they will finish mid September. I reminded them that in 2014 I averaged 20 a day from here to New Hampshire and 14 a day the last 350 miles because the terrain is so much harder. 
Water is scarce in this section of trail. The shelter near where I am is 1/2 mile off trail so I ate my dinner at a river then headed up the hill, passing the shelter. I intended to do about 3 miles and look for a good spot. I have this system that if the spot is a 10 I stop. The later it gets the lower my standards. Well 1.5 miles in is a great spot so I stopped even though it is only a bit after 4pm. It still is 19 for today and over 60 the past 3 days, so that is good. Tomorrow will be 16.8 if I do what I am planning then 15 into Daleville on Friday. I am/ was very tempted to keep moving today but there are no designated camping spots for the next 8 miles and I do not want to get over tired.
Right now the sun is out and there is a wonderful breeze. I have been here 30 minutes and only one hiker has gone by.

I was too slow getting out to see anything but I assumed it was a bear based on it being quite noisy. A deer walks much quieter.
About 2 I awoke and was surprised as to how quiet the forest was. At 5:30 I woke up for good and the birds were all awake and chirping their songs.
The morning once again started with a thousand foot climb. It was a chilly morning but I wasn't cold for long. The ridge was fairly rocky so slower going. About 4 miles in was Dragons Tooth, a popular rock formation. I moved on as 2 miles away was Catawba Grocery. They have a hiker friendly selection as well as a nice deli. I ordered a burger, fries and a large ice cold drink. I also had a chocolate milk to start with. With a full stomach I had a .4 mile walk back to the trail, then on toward McAfee Knob, 10 miles away. At one point I had cell reception so called Elizabeth and caught up on events at home.
In the parking lot there were two other hikers. Even though it was only 2 they were going to head to the Homeplace for dinner. They open at 4. We ate there last Sunday. I headed up after about 30 minutes, repeating the hike I did with Elizabeth before we went to the Homeplace. It was busier today with several people on top. After a bit of time on top I moved on to a shelter a little less than a mile away. I am tenting but there are people here, a bear box to store food and a privy. 
This place is very popular. No one is in the shelter but there are lots of tenters. There are 4 section hikers my age here, so had fun chatting with them. It is now 8:30 so in my tent ready for bed. I want to get up early tomorrow to get into town. It is 15.4 miles.","Random campsite

I was thinking ""only"" 15.5 miles. Still a pretty productive walking day. I stopped for 3 or 4 short breaks but pretty much had pizza, cold drink and a shower in my head. 
The walk is actually quite pretty. You go along a ridge to Tinker Cliffs where you can see back to McAfee Knob. The trail goes right on the edge of the cliffs for a bit. You can walk away from the edge of you are concerned about the drop off. We then go along another ridge with a pretty reservoir down below. The down into town is gradual so not too tough. Then when you pop out of the woods you are on a busy road with a Pizza Hut 100 yards away. The Super 8 is right next door. A big grocery store and a nice outfitter are close by as well.

I also heard from Finger Lickin. She will not be getting here today. She is going to try and catch me next week. There is rain in the forecast so I will probably shelter hop and do slightly less miles.

The hotel here has an old desktop computer so I was able to finish up a bunch of loose ends this morning. I have all my work stuff backed up on a flash drive so I will be good to go once I get my old laptop in Waynesboro. Tomorrow morning I will ship my broken one home.
About noon I was heading to the grocery store and saw really dark clouds. The forecast was for afternoon storms. The further I got from the hotel the darker the skies got. It is 1/2 mile total. I bought a few items and a chicken dinner from the deli. As I stepped outside the rains started. Then a flash of lightning and a loud clap of thunder followed by hard rains. The store has a display of outdoor furniture so 4 of us (all thru hikers) sat there and ate. The other 3 also started late April so hopefully will be seeing them again up the trail.
I looked at the updated forecast and it said storms ending at 2. At 1:45 the rains stopped and by 2 the sun was trying its best to shine through. I then had a nice dry walk back to the hotel.
Still no sign of Finger Lickin. I was thinking she would arrive here today. It is now after 6pm. Tracks is 20 miles back at 4 Pines Hostel for the night. He thinks he will be here tomorrow night. Mouse and Jawz are further back.

A few miles in I met Truck at a road crossing. She had gotten turned around and walked south for a bit. About 1/2 mile north we saw where she got confused. It was in a cow pasture, she took a cow path, not the AT, and when she turned back she took the wrong direction. 
The morning was cloudy and the forecast was for 100% chance of afternoon rain. I am feeling good and the terrain is a bit easier so the miles went fairly fast. We are now by the Blue Ridge Parkway. We were in the clouds so very low visibility. At one of the crossings I could not see any blazes so I pulled my phone out of my pack to use my app that has maps and GPS. It showed me the way.
Soon after the rains started coming down hard. My goal for the day was a small shelter. I started wondering if it would be full because of the rain. When I arrived at 4 the shelter was empty so I have a place in out of the rain.
At 5, I was still by myself. Soon after a SOBO section hiking father son showed up. They chose the shelter. Then Buckles came. I rented with him last week by the big oak tree. I chose the only real tent site here at the shelter. By 6:30 the rains had basically stopped. A couple stopped by who is driving cross country. Turns out there is a parking lot 1/4 mile north of here. It is now almost 8 and there have been probably 10 thru hikers come through. With the lack of tenting space most have moved on.

The shelter is .3 miles off trail. The trail was on a forest road for about .1. Trouble is I missed the turn. After a quarter mile I realized my mistake. So a mile of walking and I have walked a tenth of a mile of the trail. Not a great way to start a long day. Today turned out to be my second longest day of the trip so far. 
There was a lot of climbing today. The trail was in great shape so it made it much easier. Again I saw very few people during the day.

There were also 6 people tenting. 
This morning 3 of us were up and out before 7. It has really surprised me how late people start their day. Three miles in I passed a camping area with 6 tents, not a sole moving at 8:30. The two other people that left our shelter before 7 did 10 miles yesterday. It continues to amaze me that I can't find someone who likes to get up early and walk 18 to 20 miles. In 2014 it seemed like there were lots of people. I also realize how Fuego/Cooper was a perfect hiking companion. We hiked the same speed, liked to go early and not take big long breaks but instead finish our miles and be done for the day. Throw on top of that all the great conversation and it was a terrific match.
I had told Barbara that I should be at the James River about 1pm. She had brought a friend who thru hiked after he retired in 1995. As I approached the bridge an older gentleman said ""you must be AZ Cruiser"" . Walking Eagle and I walked the quarter mile back to his car together. First thing he did was hand me a Snickers bar, a thru hiker staple snack. It was great fun sharing stories. He was involved with starting the AT museum in Pennsylvania. His license plate is AT GA ME.

Once we were down off the high ridge there were a few streams. I twice did a sponge bath to clean up and cool down. Looking at the elevation profile I thought the afternoon would be easy. Not so much as we were always on a side hill, in rocky terrain or mud. I knew I had plenty of time so never rushed and took lots of small breaks. I arrived at the shelter just before 5.

After climbing the final 100 vertical to the top it was then over 3,000 vertical down to a river crossing. About 2 miles past the river there is a side trail that follows a river valley. The AT of course goes up along a high ridge. This is my third time on this section of trail so I took the alternate route. It was not on my app on in the guide I had, so I was flying a little blind. After a short bit there was a very steep climb followed by an equally steep descent to the river. The next mile plus was probably the prettiest stretch of trail I have been on in the east. It was an almost constant waterfall with swimming holes periodically. There were a few awesome tent sites right on the river. As I was climbing out there were 3 different couples heading down with full packs. I was very glad I chose this route. I think it was about 3+ miles total before joining back up with the AT.

I took a couple steps towards it hoping he would scamper off the trail. Nope, he decided to poop instead. I then said to FL, I wonder where mama bear is. We turn around and she is 100 feet behind us, also on the trail. Not the best place for us to be, between a mama bear and her cub. Mama started walking towards us, so we went off trail hoping to get cub to head down the hill. He decided to continue down the trail, so we followed him with mama following us. It was pretty awesome.

The initial plan was to do a half day today but there are flood warnings out for this afternoon so may as well stay dry. Doc and Hummingbird are both zeroing here today as well so they were encouraging us to stay. We may try to do the 53 in 2 days, who knows.
It is noon as I write this. I have payroll and invoicing done, resupply done, so the afternoon to relax. Tracks is probably going to join us tonight as well. He had planned to hike on but when we were staying he asked if he could stay in my room tonight as well. It hasn't rained since early this morning but the next round of storms are due between 2 and 7. The mountains have been in the clouds all day.
Great zero day. Tracks did stay and meet us in town. Four of us went to Jurrasic World 2 in 3D. We had ice cream first at a local shop. The wife was working and remembered us right away from the night before. After the movie we were walking by the shop again and the husband came oit to say hi to us. What a great couple. They have all kinds of interesting flavors and make all their ice cream there. Reminds me of Ben and Jerry's when they started in the late 70s.
After the movie we ran in to Who, Silver Back, Nameless and Short Legs. They all joined us for dinner. 
The storms did roll through. The river was a muddy mess and it poured while we ate. The skies then cleared so hopefully tomorrow will be the start of a dry stretch.","Front Royal

As soon as we got in the forest the past 3 days of hard rain was very apparent. Mud and water everywhere. My feet were dry for maybe 5 minutes. The slippery trail made for slow going.
The plan was to go 23.6 and evaluate moving on. It was obvious that 23.6 was going to be our target because it was slow going and everything was soaked. Then at 1:30 the thunder started rumbling. By 2 it was a full out downpour. So much for 50% chance of scattered showers. It poured hard for over an hour. Everyone out here is getting frustrated by the rains. 
We made it to the shelter a little after 6. Finger Lickin is tenting. Tracks and I are in the shelter. There are only 4 of us in shelter designed for 12.
 Hopefully tomorrow will be dry and the trail will start to also dry out.","Front Royal

AZ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595347,"A long day today so a short entry. Just getting settled in my tent at 9:30. After yesterday's 23+ in the mud and rain we figured why not do 25+ with the first 14 being the Rollercoaster. This is a series of constant up and down. Much of it is rocky so slow going.
The morning started with a muddy stretch so I started with yesterday's wet muddy socks. Once we started up the second hill I put my dry socks on. I am only carrying 2 pair but plan to buy a third pair tomorrow in Harpers Ferry. 
At the bottom of each bump was a nice stream so no concern for water. Once we got done the 14 the water also ended at least on the trail. The only two water sources this afternoon were .3 miles off trail.
I was walking with Tracks this afternoon when we came upon a big rattlesnake across the trail. He did not move with hitting the ground around him. Tracks touched his tail with his pole and he coiled up and rattled for at least 2 minutes. We backed off till he calmed down. I tried pushing a stick near him and ended up hitting him by accident. No movement. Tracks then tossed an acorn that hit him and he finally moved out of the way but just barely. We dashed by after a 10 minute stoppage. 
Our goal was to hit a deli that is .3 miles off trail. We reached the road at 7:15 and headed over for some fried chicken. We asked to tent in their back yard, but no go. It was after 8:30 by the time we got back to the trail. Now we had to find a place to pitch our tents. About a mile in we found a good spot.","Rod Hollow Shelter

We had about 6 miles to get to Harpers Ferry, home of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. We all got our pictures taken and put in the thru hiker book. I was number 1,101. I said hello to ATC employee Laurie who is friends with Barbara Etherington from Laurie's thru hike 31 years ago.
We were waiting for a bus to Walmart when a mother daughter thru hiking tandem offered to take us and wait while we shopped. Perfect. It was then on to old town to eat lunch.
I had been in touch with trail angel Vicki - The Real Deal. We agreed to meet at a state park at 5:30 and then go to dinner, the four of us. As I was approaching the park at 5:15 Vicki was headed towards me. Tracks wawas just ahead and Finger Lickin right behind me. Vicki is a friend of Slim's.

Tracks and I both took a shower even though it was starting to rain. It was my first shower in 4 days. It was tough putting on the same sweaty clothes. Didn't really matter since it rained for the next several hours.
While at the campground Who and Silverback came through. They were doing a 40 mile day. Shortly after Doc and Hummingbird came through. They were going 43 miles. All of West Virginia and Maryland in the same day.
Vicki texted and we tried to find a timetime and place to meet again but it didn't work out. Our progress today was slower than anticipated so it was good we didn't make a commitment. Vicki is great to the hiking community. At the shelter tonight is No Problema. He met Vicki a few days ago.

We were dropped off at Amicalola State Park at 5pm and hiked the first 4 miles of the approach trail, so we actually started the AT (Springer Mountain) on the 29th. Tomorrow we will reach the half way point.
Last night was probably the busiest shelter I have ever seen. There were 11 of us in the shelter and 20+ tenting. The rains did come, sometimes heavy, so it was nice to be inside. This is a nice new shelter with lots of space. This area of the trail has the nicest shelters. We were walking at our typical 7am. The terrain was not to bad, so rocky stretches. Five miles in we reached Pennsylvania. 
While eating lunch we talked with a family who is thru hiking. They have 3 daughters ages 17 to 10. The kids were great, very social.
We made it to the road where we were heading to a hostel for a shower and laundry. It was about a mile from the trail.

It is a regular hiker hostel so we were able to shower and do laundry which were the main objectives. About 11 the moon cleared the trees and it was like someone turned on a spotlight. We were also by a busy road so plenty of traffic noise. Next thing I knew it was 5:48 so I guess it didn't bother me. 
Everything was soaked because of the morning dew. The day was dry and sunny so no big deal.
Today's walk was great. Only 20 miles, reasonable temperatures, easy terrain and the trail is drying out so not too much mud. We started at 8 and Tracks and I finished at 4 with plenty of breaks. The ladies took longer afternoon breaks so they arrived 30 minutes later. The highlight of the day was passing the half way mark of the trail, 1,095.45 miles.
We stopped at Pine Grove State park. This is where hikers take part in the ice cream challenge. Last time through here I was hiking alone and no one around so I passed on the ice cream. I had planned all along that I was going to do it this time. Tracks was all in as well. It was actually much easier than I thought it would be. The store sells the typical boxes, but they are 3 points. So after eating a whole box you have to buy a hand packed pint. I went with neapolitan for the 3 pints on the suggestion of a guy wwwho had just finished. Having 3 different flavors was a good idea. I then went for chocolate chip cookie dough. There are no real rules but you are supposed to eat continuously and not just pick away. I ended up taking about 45 minutes. 
Just as I was finishing they announced the grill was closing so I ordered a large fries. Washed that down with a coke. Made for a good dinner.","Fayetteville, PA

In a few days I will fly home to Phoenix. Finger Lickin got off with me. I am dropping her off in New Hampshire. This morning we bought drinks and fruit and went to a road crossing. Tracks and Hummingbird both came through and hung out with us for a couple hours. Several other friends stopped by as well. We said our good byes and took off about 2pm.
I have walked about 4,000 miles on the AT. 2,200 in 2014 thru hike, 700 in 3 section hikes and 1,100 this year. I just ran out of motivation this summer. I feel great physically, no issues with feet or muscles. 
So, I have decided to purchase a bike and join a buddy on a 1,000 mile bike ride starting August 25th. We will start in Seattle and ride down the Pacific coast into California. I have never done an overnight bike trip, so why not start. ",,View Entry,"Jun 30, Sat",0
AZ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597365,"My plans are definitely moving forward for our upcoming bike ride. I purchased a Salsa Marrakesh touring bike last Friday and have ridden every day in an effort to get in bicycle shape. I rode my mountain bike a few times before purchasing the Salsa and my butt and my knees bothered me. Kind of worried me as to what am I getting myself into. But I love the new bike. I am slowly upping my mileage. This morning I rode over 16 miles nonstop with zero issues. Took me an hour and 7 minutes. (14.3 mph) The bike comes with a Brooks leather seat, which came very highly recommended from long distance riders. From what I have been told the big padded seats are good for short occasional rides, but if the plan is to do distances you want a small leather seat. I have not purchased any bags yet, but we don’t leave till August 23rd. I purposely came home early enough to give me plenty of time to get my butt and knees in good bicycle shape. 
 

I have been watching YouTube videos of the Pacific Coast Route and it looks awesome. I am joining my buddy Frank on this trip. There is a 3rd guy who I have not met yet, but he is the experienced distance rider. Frank has done several week long sightseeing rides, but typically 30 mile days. I have never ridden more than 20 miles in a day and haven’t been on a road bike in 8 years (till 4 days ago). We plan to head west out of Seattle on August 25th, ride through the islands and join up with the Pacific Coast bike route. This will bring us through Astoria, Oregon and then basically follow the Pacific coast south. The route goes all the way to Mexico. Frank is doing this as a charity ride so his goal is to do at least 1,000 miles which brings you to Santa Cruz, CA. If all goes well I would like to go further, as Santa Cruz is just north of Monterrey and Big Sur. We shall see how things go.

 

The idea is to camp 5 nights a week and stay in motels 2 nights per week. Frank is planning to ride 6 days per week and have 1 day off. The goal is to average 50 miles per day. From what I have seen so far the route is mostly on roads. There are bike paths in places. I have ordered two different guide books to see what they suggest. There is a map set available as well as an app for your phone. I love having the hiking apps. I used Guthook’s app this year on the AT and also on the Camino in 2015 and 2016.

 

So back to the AT. Most of you know I thru hiked in 2014. This year I started on the approach trail at Amicalola State Park (GA) to Pine Grove State Park (PA). Previously I have section hiked from Kent, CT to Rangeley, ME. So basically I have only 578 miles left to finish a section hike of the AT. My plan at this time is to go back to PA in 2020 and hike to Kent, then jump ahead to Rangeley and finish at Katahdin to complete a section hike. Next summer my wife and I are planning to return to Spain to do another Camino. We are leaning toward another Frances hike like we did in 2015. In 2016 we started on the Norte but ended up jumping down to the Frances.

 

Several of you have asked if I plan to journal on this bike trip and where. Yes I do plan to keep a journal and will just continue it here on this 2018 AT journal. I will start daily posts once I get going the end of August.

All went as planned. The navigation is the hard part. The route is not marked and we took all back roads. Overall we took 3 detours, but none were a big deal. We had a nice lunch on the US side in Blaine, WA. After lunch we rode 1 more mile to the border. I have a printed guide and an app. It is tough to look at either while riding.
At the border is a grand monument in the middle of a beautiful field. You actually cross I5 to get to it. Since the Canadian customs is there the traffic is moving slowly. The parking lot for the park is right on the border. There is no fence or any indication of an international border. There is a mowed field between the parking lot i the US and the houses in Canada. 
Bellingham is a great little city. We have gone out to dinner both nights here. Tomorrow we head south and plan to stay at one of the many state parks along the way.
Today's 50 miles of riding were by far the most I have done in a day. 35 was my previous high. Tomorrow has rain in the forecast, so we shall see where we end up. The drivers here in Washington seem more courteous than Arizona. The roads were busy, but not too bad.","Canadian border

Jim Frank and I got started about 8:30. Shortly after we left a light drizzle started and continued off and on all day. The temperatures never broke the 60 degree mark. 
Once we got south of Bellingham we cruized along the coast. Lots of rolling hills and forest with a periodic view of the water. After 15 miles we came out onto flat farm land. At one point we passed a small river and fisherman were literally standing shoulder to shoulder. I had never seen anything like it. Everyone was after a salmon dinner.
At the 27 mile mark we arrived at BayView state park. It was cold and breezy. After a break I left Frank and Jim to ride to meet my buddy and his wife at Deception Pass state park. It was great to see them. They moved from the Phoenix area a few years ago to Seattle. We had a great lunch by the beach under the bridge. We then went to his crab trap about 2 miles away.

Last night the best chance of rain was for the morning so we discussed just getting a late start. This morning we figured we may as well just go and take our chances. 15 miles in was a ferry crossing that runs about every hour. Turns out we timed it perfectly. They were just starting to load the cars as we arrived. 
We landed in Port Townsend 30 minutes later. Within 1/2 mile of the dock we got on the Larry Scott trail. The trail was about 7 miles long weaving through the forest. The begining was right along the water. It was great being on a quiet path. We saw a horse and a couple bikers.
We then had a beautiful ride along the coast with lots of ups and downs. We stopped in Port Ludlow for lunch. While there the rain moved in. With the temperature never exceeding 60 it was a chilly day again. Out of Port Ludlow we continued along the coast till we hit the Hood Canal bridge. We went from a quiet back road to busy Route 3. Even though the bridge had a wide bike lane it was quite stressful going across the 1+ mile bridge. We continued on route 3 after the bridge. Again there was a wide lane for us but cars are zooming by at 60 mph. 
A few miles later we turned on to another quiet road. What an awesome way to finish the day as we cruised into Poulsbo. In our last 5 miles probably 5 cars passed us, plus it was a wide road with a nice shoulder and the rain had stopped.","Oak Harbor

I need to get used to traveling with a group. I am used to having more alone time. It has been great riding with Jim and Frank as it feels safer with the 3 of us in bright clothes and flashing lights. So far the drivers have been very courteous. No bad experiences in the first 3 days of riding. (I am writing this in the morning before leaving Poulsbo)
Poulsbo is a great town. Norwegian descent so fun seeing the architecture, even Norwegian flags flying. This morning we will see the sun for the first time and the forecast calls for temps in the 70s. The last 2 days have been low 60s and rainy.
We are off the suggested bike route by a few miles, but with Google maps it is not a problem. Navigating is the biggest challenge. The route is not marked in any way so you have to pay attention. Thank goodness for smart phones and built in gps. 
We rolled out this morning under clear skies. Beautiful day. The picture is taken from our hotel parking lot. Today was fairly uneventful. Lots of rural roads which is awesome. We did hit our first really steep hill. We all walked our bikes up. Once up it was great riding. I am the navigator and we missed a turn. I thought all was good since we were going in the correct direction but turns out we were on East Mason Lake Road, not West Mason Lake Road. Oops, we are on the wrong side of the lake.

We once again started out not following a route, choosing to do our own. Thanks again for cell phones and gps. The first leg of the journey was 28 miles to Elma. The last 12 were an awesome gradual down into town. The morning stretch was all rural roads with almost no traffic. I am looking forward to the coast but these back roads with little traffic are great.
After a short break we headed out again. The first 10 miles were through a few small towns. The highlight was passing a nuclear power plant that was never finished. We stopped for lunch in Artic, 47 miles in. We have 17 to get to Raymond, our destination for tonight. There are 4 good hills between us and Raymond, should be fun. (Obviously I am writing this at lunch.)
The hills were not too bad. We were on the 101, which is a busy 2 lane road, but with good riding shoulders. The traffic tended to go by in groups, lead by a semi or loaded logging truck. We made it to Raymond by 3pm. Great day. Now to take a shower and relax. Another 60 miler planned for tomorrow to get to Oregon.
With Labor Day coming up we need to figure out places to stay. The state parks takes bikers, but with the van we have to figure things out. It took some figuring but I think we are set.

Raymond was another Washington town with a declining population. It was nice and trying to upgrade itself.
We started out on a nice bike path for the first few miles. Then it was on to the 101. Easiest day of navigating as we stayed on the 101 for the rest of the day. Most of it has a great riding shoulder. We rode through forests and along mud flats. At one point a town called itself the Oyster capital of the world. Even the 101 through here has been light traffic. 
28 miles in we met the van and Jim took the rest of the day off. I have forgotten to mention there are blackberries everywhere. I eat them at every stop. The van dropped Jim at our camp spot for tonight and them came back and met Frank and I in Chinook Washington. We then also hopped in the van and got a ride across the Astoria bidge - 4 miles long with no bike lane. Many cyclists take and inland route through southern Washington so they don't have to cross this bridge. We wanted to stay along the bays so this was the compromise, drive across.
We are now in Fort Stevens state park. The weather today was low 60s and misting much of the day. It makes it tough to see when the glasses get all wet. A far cry from yesterday's sunny and 84.

Last was fun. We explored the state park, which is at the mouth of the Columbia river. In the late 1800s the corps of engineers built a rock jetty a mile out into the ocean/river to keep the sand from choking off the river. We then went into Astoria and had a great meal on the waterfront. The evening was sunny and in the 60s.
We tented in Fort Stevens. I made a critical mistake pitching my tent expecting good weather. Well the rain came in and literally came into my tent. 4,000 miles on the AT and never had this problem. 
We rode south to Seaside for breakfast. It was raining the whole time. While eating we booked a room for tonight instead of camping again. (50% chance of rain tonight) it has cleared while stopped so should be a nice afternoon to ride. More later.
After breakfast we heading south to Cannon Beach. While stopped we chatted with others who are on vacation in this area. A couple from Georgia and another from Maryland. 
It was then off south again. We had a couple big climbs in the afternoon. The coast has been spectacular as advertised. Early afternoon we were rolling through Nahalem and there were some locals playing music outside so we stopped for a quick break.

Last night was great. We rented a family suite, so all 5 of us were together. The retired couple driving the van got a private room, Jim a bed and Frank and I ""camped"" on the floor. We all dried our stuff from the previous night. Again familiar memories from the AT. Since we left Bellingham we have had one dry night. Most mornings we are riding in a mist till about 10am. We got take out pizza and watched the sun set over the Pacific from our balcony.
The fog and mist moved in again last night so everything was soaked in the morning. Today the road dried out about 10:30 and the sun came out about noon. 
15 miles in we arrived in Tillamook. We went right by the factory where they make the cheese. We did stop for breakfast. By this time the mist had lifted. After breakfast we continued south on the 101. Even though it is a busy highway it has a great riding shoulder. 
A bit south of town we took the Oregon route. The book and the ACA headed to the coast on a back road. We stayed a bit inland. While on this route we saw our first biker. A self described ""hippie, jesus loving"" guy headed to a Shakespeare festival. We saw him a couple times but then got ahead of him and never saw him again.
This afternoon we had our biggest climb yet. It was quite a nice downhill afterwards. Going up was a truck lane, so a smaller riding shoulder. Traffic was not bad so no close calls. I have been very impressed so far with driver etiquette. I have not had anything close or scary so far. We ended our 62 mile day in Lincoln City. With the sun out the temperature topped out at 63.

What a great dat today. It was clear overnight so a bright blue sky and dry roads this morning. Then the terrain was awesome. I have been worried about traffic on the roads this holiday weekend. We got a good start (before 7:30) in the chilly morning - 50 degrees. We were so out of town and cruising on a nice wide bike lane. About 10 miles in Frank and I stopped at one of the many harbors. BTW - Jim took a rest day today and road in the van. There were 3 whales in the harbor. It was great fun watching them.
A bit further south we had a side road to get off the 101. For 4 miles we saw 2 cars. During this we had a 500 foot climb. At the top was another lookout so we stopped again. The downhill was fun on an empty road.
Soon we were in Newport where we met the van for breakfast. The temperature was still in the 50s but the sun was shining. On the way out of Newport we had to cross a big brdge built in 1938. A neat old bridge, but no bike lane. There was a 2 foot wide walkway, so we walked our bikes the mile over the bridge. 
Once on the other side we got in a groove and cruised along the coast. We did stop at one of the lookouts. We finished for the day about 1pm with 51 miles ridden. This was easily my favorite day of this trip, great weather and scenery.","Lincoln City

This morning we got started shortly after 7 under clear skies and 48 degrees. Still surprisingly cold. We soon were climbing so warmed up quickly. The coastal views were amazing. During one of the climbs you could hear the sea lions barking so we pulled over at the next lookout. Sure enough there were hundreds of sea lions on the beach below us. There were several playing in the water as well. It was fun watching them time the waves to get up on the rocks.
24 miles in we stopped for breakfast. At this point we have gone inland for a while, but still fun riding through the forest. This area has tons of big sand dunes so lots of ATV rental places. We spent the entire day on the 101, so quite a bit of traffic after breakfast since it is a holiday weekend. The 101 continues to have a nice shoulder so no big deal.
At the 51 mile mark we stopped for a break. We were inland so the temperature was 70. The winds picked up from the north. We had a big climb to start then a long downhill with a tailwind. Even the flats felt like a downhill. Our destination for the night was Coos Bay, a total of 74 miles, our biggest day yet. Right before town we had to cross a mile long bridge with no shoulder. It was intimidating but the cars behind us were very good so turned out to be no big deal. 
I feel great, no muscle issues. When we stop we get lots of questions. It is always fun to talk with people, some are locals but many are also travelling. Last night I met my first fellow cycler. He is from Germany and started the day before me. He took today off as a rest day, so probably won't see him again. A common question is comparing backpacking to cycling. They are quite different. Cycling is much easier in my opinion. Today we covered 74 miles in less than 5 1/2 hours of riding. We passed many restaurants, stores and hotels. In 5 1/2 hours of hiking I would be hard pressed to cover 15 miles of terrain on the AT. I have not been tired or sore on this trip and have covered at least 50 miles each day. Obviously we have eaten out and stayed in motels most nights, so that helps. I do miss the social side of life on the AT.","Yachats

Last night we were in a Motel 6. It was very clean. For dinner we headed over to a casino and got the buffet, no gambling for us.
This morning we headed south on the 101. The Oregon roads continue to be great for riding, new pavement and nice shoulders. Initially I was dreading riding so much of the 101 because of traffic but I almost prefer it to the back roads. The back roads are quieter but when there is traffic it is tougher for cars to get around us. So far all has been good. The drivers continue to be courteous. 
We did not have much coastal riding today. 25 miles in, Frank and I took a detour to Bandon Dunes, a big coastal golf resort. They have 4 courses, all high end. We looked around a bit then headed back to to pedalling south.
The side trip added a few miles as we wanted to reach 60 for the day. Today had lots a little climbs, but only one big one, which was really two as once we crested and dropped a bit the road headed back up. 
This afternoon Frank was having chain problems so he was riding ahead. He is the strongest rider of the three of us. I stayed with Jim who is the slowest. The winds were once again very strong out of the north, which helps us as we are riding south.
On the final decent into town I had a blow out. It was scary at first, but not a big deal really. I safely stopped. Since we do have a van and I was only 2 miles away I called and they came and picked me up. Within seconds of calling a truck pulled over and offered me a ride as well. 
Since Frank is having problems and I do not have a spare tire (I do have a tube and could ride on this tire if need be) we plan to drive to a bike shop in thethe morning then continue south from there. We may get to California tomorrow, we shall see.","Coos Bay

This morning Frank and I rode in the van to a bike shop. They didn't open till 11 so a leisurely start to the day. I purchased a new tire and tube and Frank got his shifting squared away. We rolled out of town a bit after noon. Jim rode south from the hotel.
The first 6+ miles were on back roads then we came out on to the 101 to cross a bridge. We decided to stay on the 101 since there is a nice riding shoulder. Sure makes navigating easier. The views today were no where as nice as the past few days.
We passed into California part way through the afternoon. The winds were forecast to be at our backs but it seemed like we were fighting a head wind the whole time.
Our plans seem to change every day. Frank wants to ride 1,000 miles then head home. I am good with that as well. We now plan to ride a few more days here through the redwoods, etc then skip south a bit. We want to ride the mid California coast including 17 mile drive on the Monterrey peninsula and to Big Sur.
Everything a day at a time for now.","Port Orford

Last night Jim invited a 28 year old Mexican kid to join us in our room. He started in Vancouver and is riding to San Francisco. He was very interesting to talk to. He has done a lot of traveling and climbing. He also wants to do the Appalachian trail. 
This morning we had 2 flat miles to start, the we had our biggest climb of the trip, 1,100 feet over 5 miles. Jim rode in the van to the top so Frank and I took off together. I was in a groove today, feeling good. The temperature was about 50 when we started but we worked up a sweat climbing. There were a couple construction projects so that helped us out. At one point in the climb we had a lane to ourselves while traffic was on the other side of a concrete barrier.
Going down was a bit hairy. There were some skinny shoulders and the fog moved in. We are in redwood country so some amazing trees. We took a side road through a state park that is an area where the trees have been protected for over 100 years.
The day was filled with hills. It was our biggest climbing day yet. A few times we dropped down to the coast. That meant another climb was ahead.
Mid afternoon Frank had a flat tire. His spare tube was bad so he borrowed a tube from Jim. (Mine are a different size.) The whole ordeal took a while. The town we finished 60 miles in was very expensive, so we loaded up the van and drove 12 miles ahead to a Motel6 and got rooms for $65.The weather continues to be very chiily. Today's high was 60 with cloudy skies and a breeze.","Crescent City

We decided to drive ahead today. The main objective is to ride 1,000 miles. We also want to get to Big Sur, so we are skipping an inland section to get back to the coast. We will then ride across the Golden Gate on the weekend and continue south along the coast.
During the drive this morning we took a detour to drive through a redwood tree. The redwood forests are pretty amazing. This section we drove has a big hill with no shoulder. Even once we hit the coast the road continued to be very narrow.
We ended up driving all the way to Bodega Bay. Everything is expensive around here. We are 2 hour drive from San Francisco . We still have 280 miles to get to 1,000 so we will end up riding south of Big Sur, which is fine with me.
I guess a rest day is good, we had ridden 13 straight days. I feel fine and look forward to pedalling south to the phantom finish line.","Trinidad

What a great day. We started out in the fog and mist again. We rode 15 miles south on CA route 1 to Tomales and had breakfast at a wonderful little diner. Town population of 200. I was a bit antsy after not riding yesterday so I broke away from Frank and Jim and just took off. The road was narrow and curvy but almost no traffic. Lots of small hills so easy to ride up then cruise down.
After breakfast the fog had lifted a d the sun came out. We rode a few miles with 3 kids (20s) from Latvia. This was their last day of riding. They started in Canada as well. The terrain was modest all day. Lots of easy hills. We rode along the water for a bit then headed inland through fields and a river valley. Part of it was on a quiet bike path through the woods.
We saw tons of bikers today, all out for a day ride. We finished our day in San Rafael, 12 miles from the Golden Gate bridge.","Bodega Bay

Wow, another great day. It's all about expectations. I was not looking forward to busy urban riding.We started in San Rafael with 13 miles to go to the Golden Gate. I put the destination in to Google maps and it came back with a great route using back roads and bike paths. The Golden Gate has two wide paths one on each side of the traffic. One is for bikes and one is for pedestrians. It was amazing how many bikers were out. 
Once across the bridge we pedalled through the Presido then took a wide road to the Golden Gate park whichbrought us back to the coast. There was a nice path along the beach where we stopped for breakfast. We sat outside and enjoyed talking with the locals. Then it was time to pedal south again.
Our big climb of the day was through a neighborhood but it was 700 vertical feet. We then headed down route 1. The shoulder was not great and lots of traffic. Jim got a return call from a friend so he dropped out for the day. Frank and I continued on. The main route followed route 1 but I had Google maps give me a route. It was great. More back roads then an awesome ocesnside bike path. The path was pretty sketchy in places. More suited for a Mountain bike but we pushed on. The path ended at the Ritz Carlton, which is $1,200 for a room tonight. It was then back out to route 1, which now had a great shoulder. I took off and felt great. We ended our day at 62 miles.","San Rafael

Today turned out to be another awesome day. We had a 45 minute drive just to get to our starting point since hotels were so expensive. It was certainly worth the drive. We were pedaling south a bit after 8. First off was completing a climb we had started yesterday. Being s Sunday morning traffic was light. The fog had mostly lifted so it appeared to be cloudy. As we were riding there was a movable sign saying that route 1 would be closed till noon on Sunday.
At 9 we reached the closure thinking ee would have to wait 3 hours for the road to open. The drive around was 90 minutes in a car. Turns out the road was closed for an Ironman race. The cops attending the closure let us through just asking we stay right and out of the way. This turned out to be the highlight of the trip so far. The next 20 miles we rode on the closed route 1 right along the coast. What a fun energy being with all the other riders.
Once we reached Santa Cruz we had 10 miles of urban riding. The route had good bike lanes but is a lot of work to navigate. By far my least favorite type of riding. This also reinforces that I am fine not riding the Southern California section.
Almost instantly we were back in the country. We rode through beautiful farm country. There were workers picking fresh strawberries. We also saw corn, artichokes, parsnips, broccoli and several other types of vegetables. The fields went on forever. 
Our day finished on a nice bike path into Marina, CA.","Half Moon Bay

This morning started in the typical mist and cool temperatures. We got back on the bike path and it took us 12 miles into Monterey. We saw a couple bikers but that was it as we were parallel to busy route 1. In Monterey we had breakfast on a pier overlooking the water. We have had great food this entire trip. We try and find the local small restaurants and it has worked out great.
After breakfast we headed out hugging the coast. This brought us to 17 mile drive which is a very popular route. They charge cars $10.50 to enter the area but bikes are free. We swung by Spanish Bay and then headed for Pebble Beach. Frank and I stopped in for a beer on the porch overlooking the 18th hole. While cruising the coast we saw seals playing just off shore. There were 10+ all swimming about and jumping fully out of the water. It was like being at SeaWorld. We also saw several deer and a few otters.","Marina

The final day of pedalling was another great day. There was no fog this morning and temps were in the mid 50s, perfect to pedal south. The original plan was to ride 30+ miles south and have the van pick us up and drive back to Monterey. Last night I suggested riding south 10 miles then coming back so we finished the trip in the great city of Monterey and didn't need to drive back.
This morning we are a little over a mile from the hotel when Frank's rear hub breaks so he can not pedal. I stopped with him and Jim rode on by himself. Frank coasted and walked 2 miles to a bike shop that opened at 9. We got there at 8:15. Turns out they couldn't fix his bike so we walked 1/2 mile to a bike rental place. Geared with a rental we took off along the Monterey Peninsula headed back to Pebble Beach. What beautiful country this area is. We stopped at Pebble and had breakfast overlooking the 18th hole and the ocean.
We then pedaled back to town. At Pebble my total distance was at 999 miles. Ironically my total distance on my bike was 1,424. It was 386 when we left Phoenix so I think I messed up the math of the daily miles. Either way, we are over 1,000 miles ridden.
This trip was quite different from what I expected but turned out awesome. Today was a fitting finish how Frank and I just figure out things as we move along. So many great sights and memories. I have gotten used to riding in traffic. California drivers have been great, very courteous. I seriously can not recall a bad experience with a driver at any point on the trip. 
As far as what is my next adventure? I don't have any plans as of now. Frank wants to climb a volcano outside Mexico City. It is over 18,000' high. We shall see.
Thanks for reading.","Monterey
