Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583003,"When I went through the south, I mostly did it extremely solo.  Even in the Smokies, there was a dearth of people, especially at night.  I can't wait to be there with company.  And with leaves.  I mean, I know I did it with leaves in 2010.  And in 2005.  But that was 8 and/or 13 years ago!  Last year's memories are much more vivid.  Having somebody to talk to.  Being there when all the hostels are open.  Seeing leaves and maybe flowers.  It will be a rush.",,View Entry,"Feb 16, Fri",0
Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583004,"When I got home in mid December, I was so happy to be able to eat real food again.  Fresh vegetables!  Fresh fruit!  Fresh meat!  I'm still having fresh fruit multiple times a day.  But you know what I missed?  Honeybuns.  My mom even gave me some for Christmas.  I rhapsodized about them in my journal so many times, I guess.  I ate the ones she gave me, too.Even though I missed fresh food, I now kinda miss trail food too.  I don't necessarily miss privies, or tenting in the rain, or being cold, or sustained sexual abstinence.  But dang.  Honeybuns.  I miss you, my little iced darlings.",,View Entry,"Feb 16, Fri",0
Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583439,"I got off the trail in December last year, and I was SO READY to be home, but now that there is another, shorter hike on the horizon, I'm super excited.  Even though I'll be walking over the trail I just did, since we're going north from Springer and I ended going south at Springer.  I guess that thruhike didn't get it out of my system.I'm not 100% sure I'm actually going on this hike, as I'm job searching and if something comes up I'll need to take it.  Finding a job, especially at a senior level, is slow.  So there's a good chance I'll still be looking when my Neon starts hiking.  And now I kinda hope that's the case.I decided to reactivate my personal blog as a place to post gear reviews and advice, as opposed to my 2018 section hike thoughts.  So I'll be doing that over at https://plutosonium.blogspot.c...  if you want to follow along.  My gear experience is of course targeted at hobbit shaped women with bad backs, but a lot of it is universal in the sense that everybody likes to carry a lighter pack.  :) I'm including links to where items can be purchased, for the most part.  I'm also planning an online store where I can sell some of the gear I've designed for myself because I couldn't find what I wanted in the world.  But that part is still vaporware.",,View Entry,"Feb 28, Wed",0
Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585291,"I haven't found a job yet, which is both good and bad.  Bad because I'm not bringing in money other than my part time yoga teacher gig.  Good because it means it won't hurt anything if I go hiking.  So I'm packing and looking forward to getting outside for a while.
I'm still enough in thruhiker mindset that I get smug anytime I'm indoors when it rains.  Isn't that silly?  I live in a house.  I'm *usually* indoors when it rains.  And yet the sound of rain on the roof is enough to make me smile.
Today I put my hiking outfit in permethrin.  I'll hang it to dry tomorrow.  I saw very few ticks last year, but I don't expect that to be the case this year.  My power bank is dying so I ordered a new one, as well as a few other items.  A replacement piece for my trekking poles.  A headlamp after I was an idiot and killed mine.  Things like that.  I'm planning one maildrop so I don't have to carry two pounds of meds, but other than that I'll live off the land / Dollar General.
I carried my loaded pack around the park yesterday and it felt like somebody turned gravity up to 5.  The partially loaded pack two days before that had felt like nothing, in contrast.  I'm going to be missing my thruhiker legs pretty hard when I'm going up actual mountains.  I'll get them back just about the time I'm finished with this section hike.
The weather in the south this year has been pretty foul.  They've had lots of rain and snow.  I'm putting my waterproof(ish) socks in my pack.  I expect I'll just see rain, but you never know.  I definitely won't be able to get away with carrying fewer or lighter layers.  Being wet all the time is a recipe for hypothermia.  
I'm going to leave my maps at home this time, though.  I *just* hiked this section, and anyway I have the maps on Guthooks.  They aren't quite the same as the paper maps, but they're good enough.  It'll be my fourth or fifth traverse of the area.  I think I can get by on memories.  Probably.  To be honest my memory is fairly crappy, but most people don't carry maps these and for Pete's sake why am I even thinking about this?  I am not carrying the maps.  Dammit.",,View Entry,"Mar 30, Fri",0

I had a great night’s sleep at our motel Gaffney, SC. We got up at 7 and got going. It was another three hours to Amicalola. It was pretty much lunchtime so we ate lunch at the lodge. Then I kissed JD goodbye and headed out. 
It felt great to be back on the trail. Like visiting an old friend. I walked along, paving myself on the uphills. The miles passed quickly. Three and a half hours later the temperature was dropping and I was at the shelter. Luckily it didn’t rain. Three quarter inches were predicted but none fell so I pretty much won the lottery. 
At the shelter I urgently visited the privy, collected water down a trail that seemed much farther than described, and set up in the empty shelter. Rain, wind, and freezing temps were predicted and inside the shelter it felt significantly warmer thanks to the wind being blocked. Almost everybody else set up tents. Tom and Naomi decided to stay in the shelter with me. 
I’m having fun chatting with Naomi, Tom, Kelly, and Colton. But it’s supposed to be cold and I’m getting in my bag soon. Tomorrow: Neon!","Amicalola Lodge

Hawk Mountain shelter (tenting)9.6 miles
Clouds rolled in, making everything damp. The wind sucked heat away from us. Rain spattered fitfully. It combined for an unpleasantly cold night until 2 AM when the wind let up. I had to pee but didn’t want to leave my bag, so I slept off and on until 6:30, then finally got up. My headlamp caught sparkles in the dirt so I knew that it had frosted. 
I retrieved my food bag and made a lackluster cup of coffee and ate a pop tart. As the world slowly came into focus, I realized that everything was coated in ice. I continued to be happy with my decision to stay in the shelter. I was chilly, but at least I wasn’t packing a frozen tent. 
I started walking around 7:30, just as the trees starting melting the ice on them. It meant an icy rain for me. I kept walking through warmer and colder areas, meaning more or less drips, or sometimes chunks of ice falling. Those stung when they hit me. 
Up at the summit of Springer I signed the register and took a picture of the first blaze. This time it wasn’t covered by snow. Thinking on yesterday, I noticed how much easier the hike up the approach trail was compared to hiking down it in heavy snow. There was no comparison. 
It was too chilly to stick around so I headed north. I ran into Neon getting dropped off. She still needed to visit the summit so she went south while I started descending toward Three Forks and what I hoped was warmer weather. It was, a little, but I kept my gloves and pole covers handy all day. I put them in in windy or drippy areas or going downhill, when I don’t make enough heat by walking. 
I ran into trail magic a couple of miles before the shelter. Wild Child was there! I said hello and got a hug. We shared some stories from our hikes. She got called away and I moved on. I have no desire for any extra food, but it was nice to see Wild Child. 
Neon had said she wanted to tent. The tent site is quite a distance from the shelter so she wouldn’t make her planned mileage. But I was way ahead so we couldn’t communicate. When I got here at 1:30 I went ahead and found a tent site big enough for two, and set up. It’s quite early to stop but that’s all right. I’ve been walking six hours, after all. My legs and shoulders feel it. And I have no idea when to expect Neon. Hopefully she finds me. The sites are spread out. I walked a fair distance in before I stopped. I need to walk another fair distance to get water. I’m putting it off in favor of lounging in my tent in the sunshine that has finally appeared. 
Later:
Turns out she wanted to tent *at the shelter*. I packed up and hiked there. The ridge runner didn’t care so neither did I. It was a much more pleasant experience tenting there than at the bare clay sites at the tenting area. ","Black Gap Shelter

I slept really well in my tent. I was warm and comfortable. My knee hurt but I eventually found that it felt better with a pillow between my knees. After that discovery it was just happiness and snoring. 
It rained much of the night. By morning it was just dripping from the cloud sitting on top of us. I made coffee and happily ate my honeybun. Packing up was a little less fun as leaves stuck to my wet tent like crazy. They are semipermanently attached. I wrestled the tent into its stuff sack like a leafy anaconda. I could barely feel my cold fingers but I managed. 
We went over Sassafras and Justus mountains today. Sassafras kicked my butt. Not sure why it felt so hard but it did. I was wiped by the time I got to Gooch Gap shelter for a break. Neon was there eating lunch. I ate a protein bar and then visited the privy, where I found what looked like vomit. With fears of norovirus dominating my thoughts, I booked it out of there. 
We’re tented tonight at Woody Gap. It’s a road crossing with picnic tables, trash cans, and pit toilets. On a little bluff back in the woods there are lots of unofficial campsites. There are a lot of us so I feel fairly safe, though I would never stay here alone. 
I ate lemon cheesecake from Packit Gourmet for dinner. It’s high in protein and it tastes good. Not an orthodox dinner, I realize, but steak and steamed broccoli was not an option. Neon let me hang my food bag with hers. She went down and is socializing while I hang out in my tent. 
Today felt long to me. Really, most folks stick to lower mileage at first. So I feel fine about being tired after a twelve mile day. I expect tomorrow to be tiring too, since we’re going over Blood Mountain, stopping to buy supplies, and then hiking on. But so far, so good. Mostly. I have a cranky toenail that I hope settles down. Small potatoes, considering. ","Hawk Mtn Shelter

Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586621,"2018/04/10Bull Gap tentsite11.9 miles
I slept well but woke to an unhappily damp tent. Clouds probably streamed through the gap all night. They certainly did all morning. I packed up as well as I could, hoping my sleeping bag would dry out later. The weather was predicted to clear, so I also intended to let my tent dry in the evening before I put anything in. 
It turned into a lovely day. I relished the opportunity to see blue sky and feel the sun on my skin. Then I put on sunscreen because hello, redhead. There are aren’t any leaves out yet. My clothes cover most of me by design, but my hands, face, and ears need help. I’ve worn a buff until now but I can’t do that when it’s warm. 
We had a really nice morning of walking. Around lunch time I joined Neon on a log for a snack. Day hikers from a local hiking group gifted us with pecan topped cookies which were delicious. 
The hike up Blood Mountain was nice. At the top I finally got up on the boulder, because this time I noticed an easy path up the side. The view was gorgeous. Neon took Sobony and The Husband’s picture for them. I took a selfie with the shelter. 
At Neel Gap I immediately ordered us a pizza, then shopped for my food resupply. The pizza tasted amazing but my body wasn’t too happy about it. Ah well. First time using the trowel this trip. 
We moved on a mile and set up with a bunch of other folks. Early reports were that the water was bad, but I went to see for myself. I found the spring clogged with leaves and silt. I cleared them out and let it flow a couple of minutes, and it ran cold and clear. I’m a little worried about the folks who haven’t figured this out. 
I have a blister going under my second toenail of my right foot, and the same toe on the other foot isn’t far behind. No idea why. It isn’t a normal problem spot for me. Maybe I’ll finally lose a toenail - a hiker rite of passage that I’ve never experienced. ","Woody Gap

It got very chilly overnight. Not freezing, but the windchill was convincing. I didn’t want to get out of my bag in the morning. It was light enough out that I didn’t need my flashlight by the time I pried myself out of the tent. I grabbed our food bags from their respective trees and returned to my tent for breakfast. 
It felt bitterly cold as we started walking in the wind. I had to put on my rain skirt and pole covers to stave off numbness in my legs and hands. We were several miles in before the sun warmed things enough to start removing layers. 
I’ve been thinking about better names for my pole covers. Like pole muffs, thinking of the furry or knit tubes you hang from your neck to stick your hands in. I said it was a shame that muff was slang for female anatomy. Neon pointed out that pole was slang for male anatomy, and that only I would have inadvertently come up with that combo. Which is probably true. Pole muffs are out. 
We passed spectacular vistas. The weather was clear, with a fine blue sky. I’m sporting some minor sunburn. 
At Tesnatee Gap we met trail angel Royce. He gifted us with fresh fruit, fun size Hershey bars, and fresh water. I very much enjoyed my little tangerine. It was hard to imagine anything better right then. 
I hit my mental stride today. It takes me a few days of wondering why I do this before I really start to enjoy a long hike. Today the world rolled like a giant ball under my feet and I was in my happy place. Which was odd considering the giant blisters blossoming on my toes. The one under my toenail tripled in size, although it didn’t feel too bad. I didn’t feel the one on my opposite little toe at all, so it was quite a surprise when I took off my sock. 
Given their location and how unsanitary it seems with constant dirt exposure, I’m leaving them alone other than some antibiotic ointment for now. 
We hiked an extra mile or so today to try to shorten our day Friday. We need to be somewhere before four that day, and we originally planned a thirteen mile day for that day. Hopefully stretching today and tomorrow will let us meet our deadline. If my feet don’t fall off first. 
I was surprisingly hungry for dinner and devoured some food somebody else left in the hiker box - four cheese mashed potatoes and slim jims. If this keeps up I’ll need to pick up some lunch foods. I never eat much at the beginning of a hike so I didn’t even bother bringing lunch for the first week or so, and minimal dinner. It’s worked out well but my belly is calling for more. 
We have three good size mountains to climb tomorrow. I hope those potatoes do the trick. ","Bull Gap

I set up my sleeping bag in quilt mode and sweated last night. I’m not sure if it was that warm or if I’m just middle aged. 
Neon got up before me. I was barely conscious when she dropped off my food bag. We got moving around eight for a planned tough day. It was tough, too. Lots of long ups and long downs. Neon hoped we would find trail magic at Unicoi Gap. I told her not to get her hopes up, but sure enough Keith and his church were there with burgers. That was a damn fine burger. 
I moved slowly all day. I feel pretty tired. My blisters are ugly but not painful. I’m just weary. Neon is thinking about adjusting her plans to involve some shorter days or maybe even a day or two off. She’s tired too, although as usual she hiked faster than me with no obvious strain. 
The views have been spectacular. There are no leaves in the way. Also there is a lot of UV. I deployed sunscreen and my hat’s neck veil but I am a wee bit burnt anyway. 
I feel like I probably have more to say but I’m tired so good night. ","Unnamed campsite

A mouse hopped on my head during the night but it didn’t stick around. Other than that I slept soundly and was startled when Dylan woke us up shortly after six. We wanted to get moving early so we could be at the hostel before the dinner run. Neon was out by seven. I followed shortly after, but never caught up to her. 
It was clear again. I sunscreened, covered up, and burned. As I was hiding from the sun I realized once again that I’ll never be able to hike the southern PCT. I’m not sure what the environment in Colorado will be like. If it’s high UV, I’ll have to come up with better sun protection.  
Today felt just as hard, athletically speaking. I still miss my thruhiker legs. At least I know how to pace myself, which helps. 
Neon and I had sizable burgers in town before shopping for supplies. As usual my food bag is ginormous. I found a Brie log and some demi baguettes so I’ll eat well for a couple of days. 
Once I got here and clean I punctured my worst blister, drained it, cleaned it with alcohol, and put antibiotics on it. It looks pretty ugly but doesn’t feel horrendous. If it starts showing danger signs I’ll have to seek medical care. Which would be annoying. Neon thinks it looks swollen but my toes usually look pretty bulbous. It looks deflated to me. My skin was stretched way, way out before I let all the juices out. 
I apologize if you were eating while reading. ","Tray Mountain Shelter

I sure didn’t want to get out of bed this morning. We all started moving slowly in the darkness of the hostel. I kept lying back down on my pad, feeling sleep tug at me. But eventually I packed up my gear and waited for the hostel to open for breakfast. I used their hanging scale to weigh my pack - 25 pounds without my crocs. 
Tom Kennedy drove us back up to the trail. I wasn’t any faster, but thanks to my massive dinner last night I was chock full of energy. The sky was alternately hot and blue or windy and grey. I alternated between my mesh head net and my hat veil. I mostly didn’t get gnats in my eyes or get sunburnt. My left ear is crispy now. It’s not a perfect system. 
Neon saved me a spot in the shelter as a payback for moving my tent our first day. I expected not to find room so I was very touched and appreciative of her gesture. I settled in and got some water as I was pretty much out. Grape flavored water, a baguette, and Brie made a delightful dinner. 
My toes are looking worse. And up to two inches of rain is predicted for the day after tomorrow. “Probably” no snow accumulation. I.e. it’s going to be fricking cold. The next two days are going to contain some suffering. Should be nice after that though. ","Top of Georgia Hostel

I slept great in the shelter. Rain poured and thunder rolled, but I was comfy and cozy. We all conked our at eight so by six I was ready to get up. The four men were not. I got my food bag, made coffee and oatmeal, and started packing while they continued dozing. Finally they started moving sluggishly. 
I checked the weather again. One to two inches of rain, forty mph winds, and then below freezing tonight. That is a perfect setup for hypothermia, with maybe a side of frostbite. I suggested to Neon that we either find a shuttle to town for the night or only plan on going as far as the next shelter. She was quite surprised but agreed. With Sundog’s help I found us a shuttle. Neon handled the motel reservation. 
I got moving first so I’d be sure to get there in time. Shortly after I started walking, a stake shaped piece of wood plummeted to the earth just to my left. I found this sobering. I wished I had my helmet. I kept walking and hoped to avoid any tragic wood related impalements. 
Neon found me as I was most of the way to the gap. When we arrived, it was still well before the shuttle was due. We decided to walk down the road to stay warm. More than half an hour later our shuttle arrived to whisk us out of the mountains. 
We ended up at the Microtel in Franklin. They didn’t have a room ready but let us stash our packs and use their bathroom to change into dry shirts. Still wearing dripping wet pants, we walked back out into the downpour to the restaurant next door for a hot meal. 
As the weather continued to suck, we congratulated ourselves on being in a safe, warm, dry place. Once our room was ready we took hot showers and got into full sets of dry clothing. It was glorious. 
Neon and I were both not too happy with my stupid toes. She’s going back to the trail, but I’m renting a car and driving home. I can’t keep the area clean or dry, and it’s getting worse every day. Neither of us has ever seen blisters act like this. I don’t want to risk infection for a hike which is basically a lark for me. I think there’s a strong chance I’ll lose my toenail, not that I care. It’s still surprisingly not very painful unless something catches on the toenail. 
Neon will be fine. She is far more social than I am, and there are lots of people to be social with. I’ll miss the chance to hang out with her. Maybe I’ll get the chance again in the future. ","Muskrat Creek Shelter
