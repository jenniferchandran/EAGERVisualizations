Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598722,"Butterfly and I had a wonderful weekend with our children in Montecito.  Our picture today is of our dinner at Oliver’s in Montecito with 3 of our children and 2 of their significant others on Friday night.  We had a really nice weekend walking around Santa Barbara and enjoying each other’s company
This afternoon we relaxed with Marcy and Kevin O’Hara and Josh and Nicole Priester.  
Our plan is to fly to Bangor, Maine on Tuesday, to shuttle up to Baxter State Park on Wednesday, and to start the trail on Thursday.  
We are pretty much all set to go.  We’ll stop by REI for a couple things tomorrow, and I’ve got a few more hours of work to do before heading out on the trail for 3 months, but we are feeling about as prepared as could be.",,Montecito ,"Jul 29, Sun",0

We arrived in Bangor at midnight last night, collected our backpacks from baggage claim and walked over to the Sheraton across from the airport (all of about 60 steps).  We both showered and were asleep by 1 and slept soundly until 7 when Laura’s alarm went off.  We ignored it and got another 45 minutes before slowly getting up and heading downstairs to breakfast.  
After breakfast, we walked to Hannafords (?) Grocery - about a mile away- to buy a few grocery items and dinner for tonight.  Apparently, the route from the airport to the strip mall is not one that people often walk - as determined by the quizzical looks on the faces of several drivers. 
Since we didn’t have to carry our dinner tonight, I bought some Greek olives and prosciutto pepper poppers for appetizers, a fresh vegetable salad, fresh prosciutto-and-four-cheese tortellini (which Laura wisely recommended we put on the salad after they were heated).  Laura added a large bottle of triple IPA for happy hour.  That was a really nice dinner.  
We had dinner about an hour ago.  It’s now 7:30 and we are enjoying the sound of the creek behind our campsite.  Well, the creek sound is soothing, but there are some teenage boys enjoying the cool creek water.  They’re just having fun, and not too loudly, but the quiet forest is preferable.
We’re set up at Abol Campground in Baxter State Park tonight.  The camp is at the bottom of the Abol Trail to Katahdin.  We’ll take it up and come down what’s called the Hunt Trail tomorrow.  The AT follows the Hunt trail, so those 5.2 miles down from the summit down to Katahdin Stream Campground will be our first “official” miles.  We’ll then walk or hitch the 2 miles from KSC back to our site at Abol.
Paul, the owner of the Appalachian Trail Lodge in Millinocket was our shuttle driver from Bangor to Baxter today.  He picked us up at 11:30. and we stopped in Millinocket for stove fuel and lunch before arriving in Baxter around 2:30.  Paul (2006 through hiker) and his wife have been the owners of the lodge and the cafe by the same name (though a few blocks away) for 12 years, and it was good to hear him talk about the success they’ve had with the hostel and cafe over the years.
It was hot today and humid, though not unbearable.  It was cloudy all afternoon, and we are expecting rain tonight.  Thunderstorms are expected tomorrow afternoon on Katahdin, so we plan to start at 5:30 and be up and down before the clouds roll in.  We’ll see.",,Abol Campground - Baxter State Park,"Aug 01, Wed",0
Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599080,"Butterfly and I are on top of Katahdin. It is 10:40 and we’ve been here for about 40 minutes. We can’t see anything. We’re in the clouds but our spirits are high.
I will do my best to update the journal, but cell coverage is not good on the AT in ME.  It will likely be several days.
To get up onto Katahdin’s plateau, we hiked up the Abol trail.  It was very challenging - a very long rock scramble, and the wind and clouds made it pretty eerie.  But we did it.  Getting cold.  Gotta go.Added later: Going up and down Katahdin is a workout. I think I prefer asending to descending because much of the way on both the Abol trail and the Hunt trail are rock scrambles and the mental (emotional) challenge of climbing up is much less than going down, at least I find it so.  We left our campsite at 5:50 and got to the summit of Katahdin at 10.  Visibility was bad - we were in the clouds.  There were a couple through hikers who had just completed their hikes, and a hiker named Diablo summited just behind us.  (Diablo had spent some time hiking with Hungry Cat - whose journal I followed this year - back in NC).  We had the honor of taking his summit photo.We spent about 40 minutes on the summit because there was cell reception there.  I know it sounds funny, but there was nothing to see.  Visibility in the clouds was 100 feet at best.  (See video of Butterfly hiking up to the summit). While I updated our trail journal and Laura sent a few texts, a number of through hikers and day hikers summited, took a few quick photos and left.","

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599461,"We got up at 6:20 and left camp at 8:40 after breakfast burritos with avocado, bacon and eggs. We had to hike the 2 miles from Abol to Katahdin Stream campground as not a single car came down the road traveling in our direction. We weighed our packs on the front porch of the ranger station at KSC and were a little bummed because mine weighed in at 38 pounds and Butterfly’s at 28.  
Had a mid-morning rest at big Niagara Falls on Nesowadnahunk Stream. I dunked my head in the water to cool off, and we met two through hikers there: Fools Gold and Postcard.  The first five or six miles were spent hiking along this beautiful mountain stream.  It eventually Emptied into the West Branch of the Penobscot river, and we hiked along it for another few miles.  We got to Abol Bridge and stopped at the restaurant there - The Northern - a little before 3.  There were a number of young, male NoBos there as well.  Funny but respectable bunch of young men.  Most were forgoing beer saying they were going to wait until after they had summited Katahdin before having another beer.  Butterfly and I had linner there - late lunch/early dinner: fish and chips, cole slaw and Baxter IPA.  
Left the restaurant at 4:30 and hiked the 3.5 miles the Hurd Brook lean-to. Along the way, we passed a couple that were both using Laura’s same backpack from Hyperlite Mountain Gear. The fellow said to Laura, “Nice Pack” to which Laura replied, “Oh, I see you have one too” and he replied, “Yeah, I own the company that makes them.”  How about that for a coincidence?  
There are quite a few campers here tonight, though a good number appear to be scouts or maybe a youth group - ie; not through hikers.  It took me a while to find a place to set up the tent, but I finally succeeded in getting a spot off by ourselves near a pond on Hurd Brook.  The pond appears to be a beaver pond - meaning one formed behind a beaver damn.  We had a nice moment there cleaning up and cooling off in the water.  Rain is expected tonight, but it’s too hot and humid now to put the fly over the tent.  I’ll deal with that if and when it rains.
I am thankful tonight for how strong Butterfly is and that here feet aren’t hurting, for the restaurant at Abol Bridge and that they have good taps, for the beautiful falls and streams we passed, for the sound of the wood thrush in the forest, and for beavers.
Good night from Hurd Brook on the AT.","Katahdin Stream Camp - Baxter State Park

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599462,"When we awoke at 6:20 it was raining hard, so we went back to sleep. We both slept pretty soundly for another two hours and got up at 8:40.  By that point the rain had stopped, though there were a lot of drops falling from the trees.  We had granola, bananas and milk in the tent as well as some almond butter right out of the packets.  I packed the sopping wet  tent fly into a water proof stuff sack.  We managed to keep the tent and footprint relatively dry, thankfully, because the forecast was for rain all day and we expected to tent again tonight.  It’s no fun setting up and getting in a wet tent.  The plan was for Butterfly to work her charms with the rain  - halt it enough this evening that we weren’t setting up camp in the rain.
It started to rain again as we finished packing, and we managed to get on the trail by 10:40.  A number of other hikers were similarly off to a late start because of the rain. 
There were several other SoBos staying at Hurd Brook shelter last night including Cold Brew and Social, both of whom are talkers.  We hiked with Social a bit today.  Turns out he got his trail name from someone he hiked the John Muir trail with who gave him the name because he talks a lot.  Nice guy, from West Virginia and his pace is similar to ours, so we expect to see a lot of him in the next couple weeks.
It rained lightly most of the day.  We put in 5.5 miles and then stopped for lunch under the overhang of a very large piece of granite near the shore of rainbow lake.  The afternoon hike went by quickly and we got to Rainbow Stream Shelter at 5:30.  We met and talked with several NoBos as we are our dinner, but decided to press on after dinner so the the hike to the White House Landing Hostel tomorrow was a little shorter.  We covered 2.5 miles after dinner, arriving at Pollywog Stream just before 8.  Our plan worked: though it rained pretty hard as soon as we started hiking after dinner, Butterfly managed to get it to stop shortly before we found our site for the night and while we set up camp.  
We are stealth camping near the stream.  I was so gross and hot from hiking through 100 % humidity that I sat in the middle of the stream for a while to cool off and clean up.  Feels so good.  
I am thankful for all the beautiful lakes and streams we saw today, for the sound of the loon on the little pond below rainbow lake, for the good conversations we had with NoBos at dinner, and, most especially, that Butterfly is with me.
We are safe, warm and dry in our tent.  Goodnight from the AT.","Hurd Brook Lean-to

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599464,"I awoke at 2:20 last night and saw shadows of leaves on our tent made by the moon.  Big drops of water still fell from the trees above us, but the moonlight suggested that perhaps the rain had moved on.
We started moving at 5:40 - a good twenty minutes before my alarm was set to go off, and we were packed and on the trail by 7.  We each ate a bar to power us up the 3.2 mile, 503 foot rise to a nice overview looking north out on Lake Namakanta and Mt Katahdin in the distance.  We stopped there at 9 for a hot breakfast of mash potato, cheese and bacon burritos.  A father out for a day hike with two young children and his father joined us to take in the view.  They were kind enough to give us a liter of water as we were out and had about 3 miles to the next reliable source according to our guide.  
We got moving again at 10 and went up and over Nesuntabunt Mountain - only 1560 ft high, but very vertical up and down (lots of stone stairs).  We appreciate the hard work that trail maintainers have put into building these stairs, but wouldn’t switchbacks be easier?  Maybe not.  Mainers apparently don’t believe in switchbacks.  We’ve done quite a few ascents that were in excess of 1000 feet per mile, though, apart from the climb up Katahdin, none have been very long so far.
Today’s hike, and much of the hiking over the last few days, was all about foot placement.  The trail in Maine is covered in roots and it’s not generally a good idea to step on them because they are slippery, especially when wet.  My picture today shows what I’m talking about.  So on much of the trail here, you can’t develop any semblance of a pace. Each footfall has to be considered carefully, so progress is slow.  Also, the roots tend to grab your hiking poles if your pole tip is too close to the edge of a root.  The poles are a big help for balance and stability, but learning to manage pole placement and foot placement to navigate these roots has been . . . frustrating . . . and interesting.  Interesting because you do learn, almost to the point that the process is automatic.  Almost.  We struggled to do 2 miles an hour today.
Laura had what she has classified as a “slip” today meaning that she went down on her butt slowly.  I, on the other hand, had a genuine “fall” when I inadvertently stepped on a root about the thickness of my pinky finger on a slanted (side to side) trail.  I went down hard, but pack and shoulder absorbed the impact, so no bruises - except maybe my ego.  
Despite the fact that there wasn’t much elevation gain or loss and that it was only 13 miles, the roots, mud and high humidity  made today’s hike a real workout.  We managed to get to the White House Landing pick-up dock by 4, called the owners and then soaked our feet in the lake for a bit while we waited for the boat.
We enjoyed a fresh tomato and cucumber salad and split a large burger and pizza for dinner.  We ate with a NoBo through hiker named Scar and his significant other named Random, as well as SoBo Elevation.  There is another couple here - also SoBos, so I don’t think we will lack company on the trail.  Other than ourselves, there’s at least 10 other SoBos that started the day we did or the day before: Cold Brew, the couple with the 2 dogs whose names we don’t know, Social, another young gal whose name I don’t recall, Rebecca and Steve, Charles and Sam (brothers from Florida), and Elevation.  We’re hiking at similar paces, so I expect we’ll get to know some of the characters over the next few weeks.  
Rebecca and Steve took a zero here today, and Butterfly and I have decided to do the same tomorrow.  We’ll catch up on our journals and correspondence, do a pack shake down to get our loads lighter, read, canoe, swim, and let our bodies do their healing and building thing.  Though it’s only been four days, we’ve done 52 miles (45.7 AT miles) over rough trails. We’re just starting out, and our bodies need the R&R.  I didn’t have to twist Laura’s arm too hard to get her to agree. We will enjoy a relaxing day on Pemadumcook Lake. 
Today I am thankful for the beautiful mushrooms all along the trail, for the young eagles we saw floating in the thermals while we ate breakfast, for water from strangers, for a well deserved foot soak, for a great dinner (with beer - even Budweiser tastes good to hikers), for canoeing after dinner.","Pollywog Stream

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599551,"Butterfly asked Ghost, “How has the trail changed you?”  
Ghost replied, “Well, I don’t know that it’s really changed me all that much, but I’ve learned some important things.  One comes from the first few weeks.  I started with a lot of stuff in my pack.  It weighed a ton.  About once a week I’d go through all my stuff and ask myself, ‘Did I use it? Do I really need it?’ And if the answer was no, I’d get rid of it.  I’d let it go.  I’ve realized this applies to my life as well.  There’s some stuff that I’ve carried around for too long.  I’ve learned to let it go.
The second thing I’ve learned from hiking the AT is to keep my eyes focused on the stuff that’s right in front of me.  If I look too far ahead or look left or right, I’ll trip.”
Words to live by.  Ghost is a US Marine Corp veteran of Afghanistan who was injured by an IED three weeks into his deployment.  He is also an AT through hiker who is a few days from summiting Katahdin and who showed up at the White House Landing just in time for dinner.
Earlier in the afternoon, Butterfly and I had applied Ghost’s lesson #1 to our backpacks.  We managed to shed several pounds each and have two priority boxes which we will be bouncing ahead a few weeks.  We know we will eventually be needing some of these things: items like my sleeping bag, my long sleeve merino wool shirt, Butterfly‘s puffy down jacket.  And some of the items we know we will likely send home: my razor, some clothes, the cooking pot and second bowl.  With some of the items, though, we’re a little uncertain and will do without for the next few weeks.  If in that time we decide we do need them, we’ll add them back in.  For now, everything is being forwarded to Andover, ME.
We also did laundry today - the old fashioned way - with a washboard and tub, made a tentative plan for the next week, read, went swimming, caught up some on correspondence, took naps and, right around sunset, went for another canoe ride on the lake.  
We’re looking forward to seeing a moose or moose.  (Seems like I need an “s” in there somewhere, but I guess not).  One walked by our cottage this morning at 5:30 as I was catching up on our journal.  I heard its footsteps as it went clopping by, and I looked out the side  window of the cottage but saw nothing.  Had I looked out the front, I was later told by Linda the owner, I would have seen it swimming across the lake.  She was up and had watched it.  
Breakfast today was eggs, English muffins, bacon and AYCE blueberry pancakes.  Right after breakfast, the owner, Bill, runs hikers back across the lake to the trail.  When he returned this AM, Sam and Charles - the 20 something SoBo through hiker brothers - were in the boat as well.  Apparently they’ve decided that the AT is not for them, and they’re getting off.
Today I am thankful for swimming in the lake, blueberry pancakes at breakfast, a successful “shake down” with Laura that knocked our weight down a lot and the serenity of Lake Pemadumcook.","White House Landing

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600326,"We left White House Landing by boat at 8:30 after a big breakfast of scrambled eggs, bacon, English muffins, coffee, orange juice and all-you-can-eat blueberry pancakes.  Surprisingly, Sam and Charles had decided that they were not going to get off the trail and they headed back across the lake to Mahar Landing with us and ghost.  With the five of us hikers, our backpacks and Bill, the owner of White House Landing at the helm, the boat rode low and slow.  
After the 10 minute ride across and up the lake, we got to the trail at 8:45 and, energized by the great breakfast, took off at a 2.5 to 3 mile an hour pace, made possible because, surprise, the trail was largely root free!  It was also flat, so no great views.  We did see a lot of lakes, ponds, streams and moose poop, but no moose (yet).
Two hours into today’s hike, the trail hugged the shores of Jo-Mary Lake.  I was drenched in sweat, and we were ready for a break, so while Laura purified water from a stream feeding the lake, I went for a swim.  Twenty minutes late we were back on the trail.  
The weather today was hot and humid, so I eyed every stream, pond or lake as an opportunity to cool off and refresh.  At 12:45, we stopped for lunch along Cooper Brook.  No sooner had I taken off my shirt, shoes and socks and sat down in the stream to cool off than we heard thunder followed shortly by big drops of rain.  We quickly repacked the lunch items we were going to eat and got back on the trail.  It rained hard for maybe 15 or 20 minutes, but the rest of the day was really damp as a result of the storm.  Pretty yucky hiking weather, but I hear it’s ideal for keeping your skin looking young :-)
We got to Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to at 3:45 and set up camp up the hill from it on a spot close to the trail.  The brook is the same one we stopped along for lunch and has a large swimming hole right in front of it.   Laura and I both cooled off and cleaned up in the brook before dinner.  Sharing the site with us is a father-son duo from Fairfax, VA who are hiking the 100 mile wilderness NoBo.
We are both pretty tired and, believe it or not, got in our tent at 6:40.  Laura is asleep now as I write this and it’s only a few minutes past 8.
Today I was thankful for cool water to swim in . . . or just sit in.

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600327,"We were both asleep before 9 last night and awoke and started moving at 6:30. We had soft/hard boiled eggs on tortillas/bagels (Huckleberry/Butterfly) and hit the trail at 8:40.  The trail tread was great for the first few miles and we made good time until the climb up Boardman Mountain.  The elevation gain up Boardman was 750 feet in 1.5 miles, so no terrible, but we are a couple of weeks away from really getting our hiking legs back, so it was a chore.  Just south of the peak was a vista of White Cap mountain and several others that are a part of the White Cap range - tomorrow’s hike.  
We stopped at an ice cold spring gushing out of a rock on the down slope of Mt Boardman for an early lunch and met a nice young couple from Philadelphia that are doing a northbound hike of the 100 mile wilderness.  
We saw a lot of moose poop on the trail again today, but again no moose.  And the parade of mushrooms continues.  There’s also an amazing yellow coral-like . . . thing - I don’t know if it’s a fungus or what.  (See photos.). We also stopped to enjoy some blueberries mid-afternoon.
Today’s hike ended with a steep ascent to Logan Brook shelter about 1/2 of the way up White Cap mountain.  We arrived at 4.  We found a really nice tent site a few hundred feet north of the shelter, set up camp and then went to the brook to clean up and soak our feet.  Afterward, we had Triscuits and cheddar cheese followed by pesto pasta with salmon and a Knorr side - noodles with broccoli.  
We were in our tent by 8 and making notes of the day on our phones, when Butterfly noticed that she was getting alerts and text messages.  She had left her phone in normal mode and had signal.  I then took my phone out of airplane mode and checked the weather.  The forecast for the next week had changed significantly - nightly lows in the low 50s, and very little rain, except tonight!  Yes, there’s a 100 % chance of rain from 3 AM until 5AM followed by a high chance of rain throughout the day tomorrow.  
Now, with approaching cooler weather and the fact that I have mailed my sleeping bag forward to Andover, ME, ( I’m using Laura’s sleeping bag liner) I reasoned that we should keep the tent dry tonight.  There was nobody in the shelter, so we quickly took the tent down and set up in the shelter.  
All is good except for the cute little mouse that is investigating our stuff.  Today I am thankful for the ice cold spring water, for wild blueberries, for a relaxing late afternoon and for a dry shelter to sleep tonight (that we have all to ourselves)."," Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600329,"We started at 8:45 after slowly getting up at 6:30.  After a breakfast of granola with banana, almonds and milk and coffee, we climbed 1300 feet in 1.3 miles to the top of White Cap Mountain.  Stopping at the top to catch our breath, sip some water and admire the clouds and 100 foot visibility, we appreciated the cool breeze.
The rest of the morning and early afternoon we went down a few hundred feet and back up a few hundred feet,
summiting Hay, West and then Gulf Hagas.  From there it was all down hill to the West Branch of the Pleasant River.  We stopped at Gulf Hagas Brook for a late lunch and there met a couple NoBos who gave us the lay-of-the-land for the remainder of our hike.  Importantly, they assured Laura that the ford of the Pleasant River was a cinch.  As we left our lunch spot, it began raining again.  It didn’t rain long - just enough to wet us - and then cleared up and cooled a bit.  A nice breeze started blowing making the afternoon hike fairly pleasant.  
We got to the ford of the Pleasant River around 5:30.  The ford was a cinch, fortunately, knee deep at the most and only about 30 yards.  Shortly after crossing, we found a great campsite on a brook that feeds into the Pleasant River.  We both washed, set up camp and had a very nice dinner as the air cooled and humidity dissipated.

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600330,"Today was the best day of weather we’ve had and the toughest day of hiking.  The humidity was low, temperatures in the 60s, sunny and . . . no rain.  We had great views from the Chairback Mountains and Columbus Mountain.  
Mainers are Maineiacs (thanks to Jerry Sullivan for that play on words) when it comes to making trails.  Over 11.2 miles of trail, we ascended about 4000 feet and descended about 2200 feet.  On the face of it, this isn’t all that difficult once you have your trail legs (we don’t yet) and if the ascents and descents are gradual (they’re not).  Trail designers in Maine, it seems, believe in going up and down every mountain, whether or not there’s a nice view on the summit, and doing so in the most direct way possible - straight up or straight down.  Now, that’s a little bit of an exaggeration, but not much.  They don’t seem to understand what a switch back is.  This really slowed us down today.    We had a number of sections of the trail where the grade was 1000 feet per mile.   And going down grades like this is as slow or slower than ascending.
We started this morning with an 800 foot climb in .8 miles as part of the ascent of Chairback Mountain.  The views from the top of Chairback were really great, and we could see where we had hiked yesterday.
We saw only 7 or 8 NoBos today.  We stopped and talked to Dahu (from Switzerland), Translator (so named because she translates for Dahu) and Hook who had all started around April first.  They told us that there was really special trail magic on the other side of Barren mountain which we will summit tomorrow morning.  
Our plan was to stay at or near Cloud Pond lean-to tonight, and that’s where we are.  It’s on the north side of Barren Mountain and on Cloud Pond and 0.3 miles down an annoyingly difficult side trail.  What a beautiful place, though.  Well worth the hassle.
During the ascent up to Cloud Pond, we caught up to Cold Brew who we had met the first day at Abol Campground.  He was  somewhat dehydrated, though a NoBo had helped him out with water shortly before we caught up to him.  Further along, we encountered a nice spring on the side of the trail that wasn’t in either of our guides.  We decided to fill up all of our containers and carry as much water up to our campsite on Cloud Pond - not knowing what the water quality would be and liking the water at this spring.  Cold Brew caught up to us and was thrilled to fill up his containers as well as rehydrate himself.  
Today I was thankful for the beautiful weather, the views, that we were able to tackle the steep ascents and descents safely and for our beautiful spot in Cloud Pond.  We are safe and warm in our tent and it’s in the mid fifties outside now.

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600770,"We got up and going early by Huck and Butter standards - 8 AM.  The going, however, was tough and slow again today, and we managed only 1.25 mph over the course of the morning.  We had some great views from the top of Barren Mt and from the ledges on the south side of Barren and we enjoyed the conversations we had with the numerous NoBos.  The view from the ledges is, I’m pretty sure, one of the first scenes in the documentary film “Walking Home” about four Mainers who did the trail (available on YouTube, very good).
Here’s a cute trail name origin story: One of the NoBos we chatted with on the Barren Mt ledges, a redhead with an English accent who hails from Seattle, was named Battalion (pronounced, “bat a lion”) because she, in reading about how the material for a shelter in Georgia had been delivered by army helicopters had not recognized the word and asked her fellow hikers, “What’s a bat a lion?”
After descending Barren Mt and walking through the valley below for a few miles, (and hitting the 100 mile mark), we came to a dirt road crossing with a large sign that said, “Trail Magic in Memory of James Adams” and pointed down the dirt road.  We had been anticipating this magic for miles as many NoBos had told us about it.  So we walked the few tenths of a mile to Terry Adams cabin where he and a friend of his son’s named Birdman, fed us hamburgers, hot dogs, potato salad, raspberry pie (home made from wild raspberries), soda and beer.  The food really hit the spot, and we stayed and chatted with Terry and Birdman for a couple hours.
We started hiking again around 2 and Laura announced shortly thereafter that she needed a nap.  We had often napped after lunch in 2014, so we found a somewhat comfortable spot near a creek and Laura napped for 20 minutes while I worked on the journal.
 We forded two streams today: Long Pond Stream and Big Wilson Stream.  Laura has become much more comfortable with fording streams - especially since the water levels have been much lower than in the video that Ghosts showed us while we were at White House Landing in which a guy is holding onto a rope stretched across Long Pond Stream for dear life in rushing waters up to his waste.
After fording Big Wilson Stream, the trail makes a left turn and follows the stream.  About a half mile down stream, we crossed Thompson Brook at the point where it empties into Big Wilson Stream, and on the other side was a perfect campsite.  We set up camp and bathed in the river - one of life’s simple pleasures.  
Today was a short and relatively easy day, but we needed it after the last few days.  We are still getting our legs, and we don’t want push ourselves too much to early.  
Today I was thankful for fantastic trail magic from Terry Adams and Birdman, for the views south and west from Barren Mountain, and for a bath in Big Wilson Stream.

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600859,"We awoke at 6 and hit the trail before 7:45 with a light step, for we knew we’d be exiting the 100 mile wilderness in 9 miles, going to Monson where we’d sleep in real beds for the next two nights, enjoying a big trail-town dinner tonight at the Lakeshore House, and zeroing tomorrow.  Also, our packs were very light as our food supplies had dwindled to one lunch, a few power bars and our emergency meal.
I was even hopeful that we’d be able to cover the miles before lunch, but alas, the trail was not smooth and the going was slow.  At 11:45, we had progressed only 5.4 miles and our tummies were rumbling, so we stopped for lunch at North Pond Brook.North Pond Brook drains North Pond and the AT crosses it right at the lake.  There’s a big beaver dam right there.  As we ate lunch, I marveled at how little creatures like beavers could build such a massive structure.  How did they evolve to develop this capability?  I’m thinking it probably has something to do with some mutation of a gene the governs the growth rate of teeth.  I can see Joe, a Cromagnabeaver with such a mutation, gnawing on a tree by a stream simply to trim his teeth. The tree falls across the stream creating a backup that prevents a few spawning trout or salmon from getting back down stream and he says to Sally beaver, “Hey Sally, how about an easy salmon dinner tonight.  And afterward, we can relax under the protection of this tree I just felled.”  The rest is history.
After a leisurely lunch, during which I managed to get a five minute nap, we saddled up and headed to Monson.  The trail runs along the southern shores of North Pond.  (These Mainers come up with the most creative names for what have to be some of the worlds most beautiful lakes, ponds, streams and rivers.   North?  Couldn’t do any better than that?)
We had gone only a quarter of a mile along the shore when I glanced to my right at som movement and saw a familiar face walking up from the shore.  Laura saw him as well and said, “Next Step, is that you?”  It was.
Now this is going to take a little explaining.  Every year in late February and March as the days are getting longer, I begin feeling a little nostalgic for the trail and so I start reading AT through hiker trail journals.  I especially like to read journals of couples that are doing the trail, and this year I’ve been following Which Way and Next Step.  Unfortunately, Which Way had to get off trail a few hundred miles back due to back issues, but Next Step has continued on and I have corresponded with him a few times through his guest book on Trailjournals.com.  When we left LA, I let him know that we were about to start at a Katahdin, and we looked forward to meeting him.  And we did.  Providence.  
We talked with Next Step for 45 minutes, and he showed us a number of stretches that he and Which Way did daily while on the trail.  Next Step has done a lot of pretty long days lately, but he said he was going to slow down and enjoy the 100 mile wilderness.  Good move, Next Step.  You’ve accomplished so much and endured so much in the last five and a half months.  Soak in the bounty of God’s wonderful creation and presence.
The last few miles of the 100 mile wilderness went quickly.  We got to the trailhead at Maine RT 15 around 3:30 and called Shaw’s for a pickup.  A while later we were unloading our gear in our private room at Shaw’s Lodging Which is owner and run by Hippie Chick and Poet - 2008 through hikers.  We both took showers and put on some loaner clothes, and I gathered our laundry from our 100 mile wilderness trek (every article of clothing we had) and headed downstairs to get it going.
I entered the game room/laundry room and started trying to figure out how to use the washer.  Several hikers were talking nearby and I heard one of them say something like, “the last time I saw that guy was when he and his wife were recovering in Franklin, North Carolina.”  I looked over, and there was 44 - AKA Steve Crowe - who had started at Springer the same day we did in 2014.  We’ve kept in touch with 44, and I knew he would be doing a section in Maine this summer.  I had let him know that we were starting and he had generously offered assistance if we needed it - including offers to stay at one of their houses In Either Beverly or near Lee, MA.  But 44 had figured out from our journal- despite my inability to post much here in Maine, that we would be in Monson on or near August 12, so he popped up from MA to try to intersect us, and as well, to start his section hike from Monson to Caratunk.
After catching up with 44 and finishing our laundry, the three of us headed over to the Lakeshore House where the food was good, the beer better and the service . . . let’s just say that the volume of hikers was more than they expected on an August Sunday night.  It’s great to see 44 again, and especially on the trail!
There’s a lot to be thankful for today: surprise encounters - most of all, but also Monson, Shaw’s in Particular, washing machines, driers and showers.

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600860,"When I came down for breakfast at 7 this morning with all the other hikers staying at Shaw’s, Poet was making breakfast potatoes on the large griddle in the kitchen.  Though it felt to me as though it was 100 degrees in the kitchen, Poet seemed in his element, and he greeted me with a smile and, “Good morning Huckleberry.”  Butterfly and I joined a table with 44 (Steve Crowe) and three other hikers and enjoyed three eggs made to order, bacon, potatoes, and AYCE blueberry pancakes.  I could only manage six.
After breakfast, we went to Poet’s Gear Emporium to resupply for the next stretch of the trail.  While checking out, we let Poet know that we would like to get a ride back to the AT/RT 15 parking area where we had been picked up yesterday so that we could walk the 3.3 AT miles from there to Lake Hebron.  From Lake Hebron, we’d walk the 1.7 miles back to Monson on Pleasant Street to make it a 5 mile walk in the woods.
Around 10, Poet let us know he was about to make a run up to the AT/RT 15 parking lot to drop off several NoBos as well as 44 (who was beginning his SoBo section hike to Caratunk) and that there was room in the car for the two of us.  So we grabbed a couple water bottles, and off we went.  At the RT 15 parking area, as he said goodbye to the three NoBo through hikers, Poet advised them to take their time and really enjoy the wilderness, for soon their hike would be done.  To emphasize his point, he recited a Haiku that he had written in the logbook of the first shelter in the 100 mile wilderness in 2008 when he and his wife Kim through hiked the AT.
Drink your deepest now,For the richest stuff settles In the final swig.
The weather today was absolutely gorgeous.  Sunny and coolish - in comparison to previous days, and the humidity was low.  We walked with 44 for a bit but he encouraged us to move ahead as he was heavily burdened and we had nothing on our backs.  Laura flew on the trail, and we did the 5 miles in an hour and a half.  We went straight to the Monson Store deli and ordered sandwiches, chips and Allagash Saison.
After lunch, we walked around Monson a bit, relaxed and napped.  I tried to work on the journal but the WiFi connection was not working and/or I kept falling asleep.  We went back to the deli for dinner because the two restaurants in town were both closed on Monday.  We got our food to go and ate outside behind Shaw’s with Cold Brew (who rolled into Shaw’s this afternoon) as well as Nick an Rebecca (who started at Katahdin when we did).  It was good getting to know them.
Today I am thankful for a walk in the woods, relaxation and the friendship of my wife, Butterfly.","Monson, ME

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600861,"Today was a rainy day, but only in the literal sense. 
Poet dropped us off at the Lake Hebron parking area at a few minutes before 9.  He asked if he could take our picture before we set off, and as he pulled his mobile from his pocket and held it up he said, “Hmm, that’s funny.  There’s a poem a friend sent to me two years ago on my screen.  I must have inadvertently hit some buttons on the drive here.  I guess I should read it to you.”  
I have grown taller from walking with trees.
I have grown smaller from crawling with snails.
I have grown lighter from soaring with birds.
And along the way I have grown wiser
from forgetting what I think I know
and listening to teachers from forest and pond.
Every know and then when I go back to town,
I forget that I need to speak English again.
For out in the forest it’s a trill or a look
and I feel their feelings or dream their dreams
while everyone knows the yearnings I hold.
So I shed my fur and grab a pen
to tell what it’s like to rise with the Sun,
to swim with a turtle, to touch a deer,
to enter their world and see through their eyes.
For these are the gifts I come to know
when the Sky and the Earth touch my soul.

The poem is by Tamarack Song.  I took a picture of it with my phone so I could transcribe it here.
Today’s hike was relatively flat, and on parts of it, the trail tread was such that we could reach our full stride and didn’t have to focus of where we placed ever foot step. We are camped near Bald Mountain Pond lean-to with 44, Nola (a flip-flop through hiker from New Orleans) and two brothers from Canada out for a section hike.  44 had saved a perfect tenting spot for our large tent by setting up his one-man tent on it and then moving his tent to a one man spot when we arrived.  Thanks so much, 44 - you are an angel!  We are camped on the shore of Bald Mountain Pond.  I took a swim and cleaned off a few minutes ago and we are tucked in for a good night‘s rest.
Tonight I am thankful for poetry, a good day of hiking, for 44’s kindness and the sound of the lions as we drift to sleep.

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600862,"We hit the tail at 8:00 after oatmeal and fruit breakfast.  Our first task was to climb up 1600 feet to Moxie Bald Mountain.  We passed 44 shortly after leaving camp as he needed to collect and purify water for the day.  A few hundred feet below the summit, we caught up to Nola - a flip flopper like ourselves - who pointed out the blueberries all around us, and we ate our full.  Yum.
The view from Moxie Bald was pretty good though we couldn’t quite see Katahdin as Poet had said we might be able to do. There were a number of NoBos there, and we had a good chat with them.
We stopped for an early lunch at 11:15 at the next lean to.  Laura left ahead of me, and I worked on the journal for 25 minutes.  When I got up to leave, I forgot my “chair”- the folding foam pads we use to sit on - so I will have to do without for a while.
Got going again at 12.  Next 3.3 miles - ideal trail conditions and we covered them in an hour as thunder rumbled in the distance.  After rock hoping across Baker Stream Which is the outflow from Moxie Pond, we began our ascent of the Pleasant Mountains.  
Thunder got nearer as we approached the first summit, but then stopped and it started to rain.  It rained just enough to soak us, but not enough to cool things off.  The sun returned, and as we hiked to the top of Pleasant Pond Mountain, I looked back and saw a rainbow.  We ate some more blueberries on the top, called Laura’s mom, and began our descent - 1200 feet in 1.5 miles - at a few minutes past 5.  The going was excruciatingly slow at first, but picked up once we got off the shoulder.  We arrived at Pleasant Pond Lean-to at 6:25 and quickly set up camp and had dinner.  Afterward, I went down to Pleasant Pond and went for a swim.  It was a beautiful evening with a new moon in the West, the sun shining on big clouds to the south, and lions calling to one another.  A perfect day on the trail.
I returned to camp just at dusk and we secured our site for the night and got into our tent.  We are about 100 yards from the shelter.  As Laura crawled in the other side, she said that a guy was approaching  our site from the shelter.  I wonder if that might be 44?
I am extremely thankful for the great blueberries we had today and my swim in Pleasant Pond at sunset.  I’m also grateful for the good views from Moxie Bald and Pleasant Pond Mountain.","Bald Mountain Pond Lean-to

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600891,"I awoke shortly after six this morning, opened the vestibule on my side of the tent and got water going in our stove for coffee and for our dehydrated “Breakfast Scramble” from Mountain House.  Not exactly the breakfast of champions, but when supplemented with a pop-tart, it’s a hiker’s delight.  
As we were deflating our air mattresses and packing our stuff up inside the tent, we heard a voice from outside say, “Good morning Butterfly and Huckleberry.”  It was 44, and it had been he who approached our site as we were turning in last night.
The three of us hiked the 5.7 miles into Caratunk, passing Lelu and her dog Bruce Willis as she was packing up.  We arrived at the Caratunk a little before 11 and headed right for the Caratunk BnB.  44 treated us to an early lunch of delicious pulled pork sandwiches and milkshakes.  Great lunch and even better company.  Thanks 44.  It has been a pleasure spending time with you on the trail again!
We resupplied for 2.5 days and headed down to the Kennebec River just in time to get the canoe ferry across the river. (I’’ve conveniently skipped over the part about thinking I had lost my wallet at the Caratunk BnB only to find it at the bottom of my pack after frantically searching the reapply room, lunch room, bathroom and everywhere else I had been.  Boy did that generate some stress.  Sorry to all involved.)
Once across the Kennebec river, we leisurely hiked the 3.3 miles along the Pierce Pond Stream to Pierce Pond.  We stopped to enjoy the stream and it’s waterfalls for a good 45 minutes and were pleased to find wintergreen growing on the forest floor.  
We are staying tonight at Harrison’s Pierce Pond Camp in our own little cabin with flush toilet, pillows on the bed and oil lamps for light.  What a treat!  Tim, the owner of the Camp remarked that hikers are the one group of people who take nothing for granted when we got excited about having a toilet in our cabin.  
The Camp is one of only a few surviving traditional Maine sporting camps dating back to the turn of the last century.  It’s a very rustic place with log cabins, a couple bath houses where we took showers, and a large dinning room, game room and kitchen in the main building.  Tim, who has owned the place for 30 years told us that Franklin Roosevelt’s daughter came here for her honeymoon because it’s remote location made it a good place to hide from the press. 
Tim let us use his kitchen to cook our dinner and also gave us a bowl of delicious corn chowder that he had made for camp guests that are arriving tomorrow for the weekend.  We ate our dinner in the dining room overlooking a waterfall on the stream and hummingbirds eating at the feeders on the porch.  Another hiker, Flamingo, arrived as we finished our dinner, and we chatted before heading back to our cabin.
Tonight I am thankful for good trail friends,  for the beauty of Maine, for Tim’s kindness and for a cabin in the woods.","Pleasant Pond Lean-to

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600892,"Our day began with breakfast made by Tim at Pierce Pond Camp: two eggs, sausage and 14 patriot pancakes.  Tim puts raspberries (red), apple (white) and blueberries (blue) in his pancakes and calls them patriot pancakes.  An excellent meal - and he provides a ziplock bag to hikers so we can take the uneaten pancakes with us for lunch (or later).  We really enjoyed our stay at Pierce Pond Camp and Tim’s generous nature.
Laura and I left camp around 8:30, and we planned to hike 15.4 miles to a campsite on Flagstaff Lake.  We passed Lelu and her dog Bruce Willis as she was finishing packing up at her site on Pierce Pond.  We put in 8 miles by noon as the trail condition were good and we were able to move at a good clip.  
We stopped for lunch around noon by a road crossing and ate our leftover pancakes.  Lelu and Bruce caught up to us during lunch and Lelu tried to talk us into going 3 more miles today to Little Bigelow lean-to.  I said we’d have to play it by ear. 
As it turns out, the trail conditions were not quite as good this afternoon as this morning, and as 5:30 approached, so did a rainstorm.  We stopped and set up camp on a gravel beach at Flagstaff lake as we had planned this morning.  As we began cooking dinner, it began to rain.  The trees by the shore provided cover at first, but by the time dinner was ready, it was raining hard.  We quickly put everything in the tent, got in ourselves and ate in the tent.  After dinner, I took my phone off airplane mode and noticed that we have 3 bars of Verizon 4G.  I checked the weather and saw that rain was expected for most of the night and into tomorrow morning.
(Cell coverage has been limited to a few of the mountain tops for the last two weeks.  There was no cell signal in Monson and the internet connection at Shaw’s was intermittent.)
It is now pouring rain and the wind is blowing pretty hard, but our Big Agnes Cooper Spur UL3 stands up well to both.  It is the best.  We are safe, warm and dry and thankful for that.  We are also thankful for cell coverage on this remote gravel beach in Maine.   Goodnight from the AT at Flagstaff Lake.","Harrison’s Pierce Pond Camp

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600894,"It’s been said that hiking the Appalachian Trail is 90 % mental.  The other 10 %?  It’s all in your head.  (Sorry.  A feeble attempt at a little humor.)
It rained much of the night, but both Butterfly and I slept well.  At 6 when I awoke, the rain had stopped and the tent fly had been dried by the wind.  Camping on the gravel beach, it turns out, was a really good idea because the gravel is ideal for draining away water.  I got out of the tent to take care of business and saw that the gravel was pretty dry as well though everything back in the woods was completely wet from the water dropping from the tree canopy.  Shortly after getting back in the tent, however, it began to rain again, so I suggested to a Laura that we sleep in.  
There was a lull in the rain around 8.  I made coffee and we had a breakfast of oatmeal and berries.  The rain returned again and we decided to wait it out.  The weather forecast indicated that it would end around 10 or 11, so we agreed to take the morning off, relax in the tent, and try to leave around noon for an 8 mile hike to Safford Notch Campground.
We are about to hike up Bigelow Mountain - named after revolutionary war Major Timothy Bigelow who summited it as part of Benedict Arnold’s failed attack on Quebec in 1775.  Bigelow Mountain has several peaks and the AT goes up and down four of them.  We’ve been warned that it’s a tough hike.  The elevation profile looks severe in Awol’s guide - similar to White Cap and Chairback mountains - going up and down trails like that when they are wet is especially challenging.  The going down is even worse than going up.  
Safford Notch Campground is in the notch between Little Bigelow (3000 feet) and Big Bigelow (4100 feet).  The Awol guide book and Guthook’s guide app indicate that the hike up to Little Bigelow isn’t too aggressive (and it wasn’t) but both show a flat, 1-mile hike across Little Bigelow, but it isn’t flat at all.  It’s an artifact of the scale and resolution of the guides that they don’t show the nearly constant up 20 feet, down 15, up 10, down 18, . . . over boulders, rock faces, etc.  We did this part of the hike around 3:30 and it took us an hour.  Fortunately, the clouds had lifted to about 3500 feet, so we had a nice view of Flagstaff Lake and the beach where we camped las night.
The hike down from Little Bigelow to Safford Notch was somewhat treacherous, but really more tedious as we are getting used to dealing with Maine’s trails.  The campground is a couple tenths of a mile off the AT, but very nice.  We are set up on a level wooden platform in a forest of northern beech trees.  The wind is drying out the forest and there’s a half moon peaking through the leaves and illuminating our tent.
All in all, today was another good day.  I am thankful for the down time we had in our tent this morning- time to catch up on the journal and to make some phone calls.   Im also thankful for the Maine Appalachian Trail Club that built the nice tent platform we are on.  And I’m thankful that Butterfly and I are getting our trail legs back.","Flagstaff Lake Campsite

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600899,"This was the he best weather day we’ve had.  The hiking was tough, especially the 4100 feet of downhill, but we were rewarded with incredible views.  
We awoke to sunshine and a cool breeze after a good night sleep, and left camp at 8:20.  After hiking back on the side trail to the AT, we did the 1900 feet, 2 mile climb up to Avery peak on Mount Bigelow in 2 hours.  We stopped there for a snack and to take in the incredible views of Flagstaff Lake and mountains in all directions.  One of the couples sharing the views with us gave us Snickers and peanut butter to help power us the rest of our day.  Butterfly asked that I say a special thank you for this trail magic.
The descent from the Eastern Peak, Avery Peak, was very technical and slow as the trail was a essentially a boulder field. The ascent of the western peak of Mount Avery was straightforward and went quickly, and we had our lunch of tortillas and peanut butter with dehydrated blueberries.  
The bulk of the afternoon was spent descending 3000 feet to Maine RT 27.  Our joints complained a lot and Butterfly pulled a calf muscle, so we took our time and rested a few times.  We met Pappy along the way.  At 87, Pappy is attempting to be the eldest through hiker.  
We got to RT 27 right around 6, called for a shuttle, and we were checked into our hotel room and showered by 7.  We are at the White Wolf Inn in Stratton, and will take a zero to help our knees and feet tomorrow.  Maine is tough!

I awoke at 5 and got up to date on world news and then started uploading photos and entries to our trail journal since Stratton has pretty good cell coverage.  I was over a week behind because cell coverage in Maine is so bad.
Butterfly slept in until 9.  We walked down to Flagstaff General Store for breakfast, the to Fotters Market to shop for the next 2 to 3 trail days.  Stratton isn’t the best place to resupply, but we made do.  I’ll be carrying a few more pounds of food than usual.
We came back to the hotel and took naps and I got the journal up to date.  Butterfly really slept.  At about 3, we took our clothes to the laundry and hung out with some very nice NoBo through hikers (Wallaby, Ditch, and a few others whose names I did not get or have forgotten). They’ve been a tramily (trail family) since pretty much when they started.  One of the guys hiked the PCT in 2015 and said he remembers our daughter Kathryn (Pocahontas) and Jillian Webster (Radish head) who also did the PCT that year.

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601346,"After breakfast of half of a leftover Hamburger and fries, bananas and graham crackers, we packed up and went over to the Stratton Motel and Hostel for a shuttle back to the trail.  As we approached, I could hear music coming from the front room.  Someone was playing Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” on the piano.  We waited outside for a few minutes under the awning where hikers waited for shuttles until another hike mentioned that I should go in and let Trout know that we were ready for our ride back to the trail.  At the point the music had stopped, and when I walked in, Trout was at the piano, so I asked, “was that you playing Hallelujah?”  Trout said, “no, but if you’d like to sing along, I’ll ask her to play it again” while nodding to a young woman washing dishes in the kitchen area.  I said sure, and as Trout went over to ask, he offered a cup of coffe.  The pianist, whose name I didn’t get, recruited another hiker with a beautiful voice to sing with me and Butterfly.  A great start to our day.  
After singing and some conversation, Trout took us back to the trail.  We started at about 9 o’clock with a 3000 foot climb in 5.2 miles up North Crocker MT.  Because the slope of the trail was somewhat more moderate than some of our recent climbs, we tackled this ascent easily and in pretty good time -arriving at the summit at 11:45.  But then it was down 500 feet and back up again to South Crocker Peak a mile away at stupid grades in excess of 1000 feet/mile.   Slow torture.  We had lunch on top of South Crocker - tortilla wraps with avocado, ham and cheese - with a nice view eastward of Sugarloaf Mt.  
After lunch, we descended 2.5 miles to the Carrabassett River.  The grade of the first 1.5 miles was 980 ft/mile and featured an especially fun 1/5th of a mile where the grade was 1550 ft/mile.  There’s a point to my reporting on all these grades which I will come back to at a latter time.  I’m too tired and beat to get into it tonight.
After crossing the Carrabassett River by rock hoping and a well placed 2x12, we literally climbed, hands and feet, up Sugarloaf Mt. It was about 4:30 PM when we started, and I had suggested to Butterfly that we camp by the river and tackle the climb in the AM, but she was feeling good and wanted to get it done today, so up we went.  We were much happier going up than down this stretch of trail.
As we climbed, clouds covered the sun and cooler temps prevailed.  Once on top, we walked on a ridge between Sugarloaf that alternated between trail that was really nice, soft, cushiony pine needles and trail that was bog.  We had been told that there were some good stealth sites on the ridge, so we filled all our water containers - 8 liters worth - and carried them to a nice mossy site at mile 199.5, arriving shortly before 7.
We are going to try for an early start tomorrow as the forecast calls for rain starting mid morning.

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601349,"Today was a pretty unpleasant day.  We got an early start - at 7:05 - because rain was forecasted to start around 9.  We got everything packed up dry, ate a some breakfast crackers and a power bar and headed to Spaulding Mountain lean-to, 2.2 miles down the trail, for a hot breakfast.  Along the way, we passed the 200 mile mark.  There’s a bronze plaque there commemorating the completion of the trail at that point in 1937.
I walked ahead of Butterfly so I could get water going for tea and have it ready when she arrived.  Lelu and Bruce Willis were at the at lean-to.  We hadn’t seen her since last Friday, though we had seen Bruce’s paw prints in the mud at various places on the trail yesterday afternoon. Lelu was discouraged by Maine and the weather and was talking about skipping the rest of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont.  
It began to rain while we had breakfast in the lean-to, and we had a hard time leaving the comfort there for what we knew would be a wet day.  We decided to push on, though, because the forecast indicated that the rain would end around sunset and that tomorrow would be clear and sunny.  So the thought process was: tent and everything in our packs is dry and will stay dry during the rain; we’ll get wet but will be warm because of the exertion of hiking; rain will tail off toward the end of the day so we will be able to set up the tent dry.  That was the thinking, and that’s pretty much how it worked out.
We got back on the trail again at 10:25 and slogged it out.  It rained most of the day, and long before we reached Poplar Ridge lean-to at 4:30, we were soaked through and through.  We had to ford a small river around 2 PM, and we didn’t even bother to change shoes.  We also didn’t bother with lunch, but did snack on trail food throughout the day.  There was space for only one more person in the lean-to, but we prefer our tent anyway.
We are camped behind the lean-to on a level piece of ground.  The rain had stopped for about an hour before we arrived, but started again just as we began to set up the tent.  We managed to get the fly and footprint up quickly as the rain started, and we threw everything under the fly just in time.  Laura waited in the lean-to while I then put the tent up from under the fly.  It’s a neat trick made possible by the Bog Agnes tent design.  Once we got cozy in the tent, we had tea, lunch and dinner.  
The rain has stopped, now, and the wind is blowing, but I don’t think things will dry out much overnight as we are at cloud level.  We’ll see.  For now, we are safe, we’ll fed, warm and dry and I see a little moonlight on the tent as well.

“Maine is the A.T.'s most challenging, rugged and remote state, and it has the wildest feel of any area of the Trail.”
Darn.  I wish we had read this BEFORE we started the trail this year.  We might have planned things a bit differently.
Last night, shortly after we fell asleep, Butterfly had a massive cramp in her left calf.  It took a while to abate, and this morning, her calf muscle was very tight and swollen, and she was walking very gingerly around camp.  It was tight like this for a day before we zeroed in Stratton, but seemed fine for the last couple days.  
I looked on Guthooks and didn’t see any points between Poplar Ridge Lean-to and Maine RT 4 where we could get off trail to attend to Butterfly’s calf, and she did not like the idea of hiking back down what we had come up yesterday afternoon to get to the gravel road that crossed shortly before the river ford.  Furthermore, it wasn’t clear from Guthook’s which way to turn on the gravel road, nor how far we would have to travel on it to reach civilization.  Butterfly thought that perhaps it would improve if she walked on it a bit.  We had enough food to spend one more night on the trail before reaching the trailhead for the town of Rangeley, so we could take our time.  If progress was too slow because of the terrain and Butterfly’s calf condition, we could spend the night in the Maine woods again.
It was colder this morning than at any point thus far in our journey.  Our thermometer registered 49 degrees.  After packing up our dry tent and all of our gear, I changed back into my wet clothes  so as to keep one set of clothes dry.  Butterfly opted for her rain pants and a dry top.  We both put on our wet, muddy hiking shoes.  It’s morning like this that really cause me to question my sanity.  I packed as much of Butterfly’s stuff as she would let me so as to minimize her weight, and off we went.
The sun was out and the wind blowing strongly.  Our first task was to climb Saddleback Junior - a 700 foot rise.  About halfway up, Butterfly’s calf was not much better, but we had a brilliant thought: use the ankle support sleeve that 44 had given Butterfly back in Caratunk as a compression sock on her calf.  This helped a lot and about a mile later Butterfly reported that her calf was 50 % better.  Thanks again 44.
Today’s hike was a series of summits - Saddleback Junior, The Horn, Saddleback - and saddles between them.  The 3 mile stretch from the North side of The Horn to the south side of Saddleback is above the tree line. As we neared the bald summit of Saddleback Junior, the wind velocity really picked up.  My guess is that it was 50 to 60 miles an hour with gusts above that.  This added another element to today’s hike.  Butterfly hiked up and over the summit of Saddleback Junior without stopping.  When I caught up to her she said, “I’m not comfortable with this.”  Neither was I, but I preferred it to yesterday’s rain.  As another element to the list of Maine’s challenges: roots, rocks,  mud, river fords, remoteness, near verticle ascents and descents, high winds.  
We went back down below tree level, and about 2/3rds of the way up The Horn, on its protected leeward side, we stopped for lunch.  The first northbound hiker of the day passed us at that point and asked about the wind on Saddleback Junior.  When I told him 50 to 60 MPH, he replied, “They’re even stronger on The Horn.”  Well isn’t that just great!  
After lunch, on the final ascent of The Horn, we met a pair of NoBos who stopped to chat.  They were Song Bird and Galaxy, and they are doing a flip-flop hike of the AT for their honeymoon!  Galaxy said that the wind on the top of The Horn had moved him 5 feet.  Fortunately, Butterfly did not hear that comment.  That must have been a bit of an exaggeration since Song Bird was smaller than Butterfly, and she didn’t report taking flight.  But when we got to the top (4041 feet), the winds were a bit stronger and we didn’t feel comfortable enough to stop for photos.  
We did stop on top of Saddleback (4116 feet), and today’s photo of Butterfly tells the story.  On the approach to Saddleback’s summit, a sensitive, elderly NoBo said to me, in reference to slender Laura, “She shouldn’t be up here. She’s going to get blown away.”  Again, Butterfly didn’t hear that comment - fortunately - as the winds, though unnerving, were not life threatening.  
The descent from Saddleback was pretty verticle but not as slow as some recent descents because the trail follows several sloping granite ridges, and this particular granite provides very good traction, even on steep slopes.  We made fairly good time compared to our time on descents of similar grade, but unless we were somehow able to pick up the pace, I calculated that we’d be getting to Maine RT 4 right around sunset.  Butterfly said that her calf was feeling significantly better, but she was not at full stride.
Right at the point where the trail grade became more reasonable (i.e. 500 feet per mile) a couple elderly gentlemen who were slack packing caught up to us.  As they passed us, they explained that they were slack packing and that their ride would pick them up at RT 4 at 6:30 to shuttle them into Rangeley, 11 miles away.  They said the shuttle driver was also the owner of the Fieldstone Hostel and Cottages, and they highly recommended the place.  They also told us about another hostel, The Hiker Hut, only three tenths of a mile from the trailhead, so we were feeling pretty good about being able to get out of the woods tonight.  
As it turned out, the more gentle slope of the trail enabled Laura to pick up her pace significantly despite the strained calf muscle.  We got to the trailhead just a few minutes after the two gents, and all four of us were shuttled by Stacy into Rangeley and The Fieldstone Cottages.  Our cottage is wonderful, and Butterfly is so happy.  While she showered, I ran up to the IGA for bread, Camembert cheese and ale.  As I walked up the hill to the store, I watched a beautiful sunset over Rangeley Lake and the mountains to the west.  
As I came back to the hostel, I met a young man who just finished the PCT a couple weeks ago and is now SoBo through hiking the AT.  His name is Adam (does not yet have an AT trail name) and he started at Katahdin on August 17.  He said he was doing 35 to 40 mile days on the PCT but is struggling to do 25 to 30 mile days here in Maine.  Ouch!
After bread and cheese, Butterfly and I went across the street to the Rangeley Saddleback Inn for dinner - excellent!  We met Adam there and had a good time talking about gear, hiking stories, etc.  Adam’s base weight (everything he carries except food and water) is 6.5 pounds!  
Today was an epic day from the cold wet beginning to the sunny, near hurricane force winds and incredible views in the middle to the beautiful sunset, fantastic dinner and cozy cottage ending.  I thank God for all of it.  Life is good.
Tomorrow we will take a zero and see about Butterfly’s calf.","Poplar Ridge Lean-to

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601365,"Huckleberry’s theory on why there are no switchbacks in Maine:  When the Civilian Conservation Core built the trail in the 1930s, it could only afford enough white paint to blaze 280 miles. 
(AT hikers have all gotten that joke, but for those of you not familiar with the AT, a little explanation might help - despite the maxim that if you have to explain a joke, it’s not funny.  The AT is marked with white blazes on trees and rocks every so often so that we know we are on trail.  Adding switchbacks to all the ascents and descents in Maine would have increased the length of the trail in Maine by at least a factor of two and would have required more whit paint.) 
Here’s one I heard from a NoBo through hiker: The trail in Maine is like the people - straight forward and to the point.
We slept in today and took it easy so as to give Butterfly’s calf some time to heal.  As we were leaving our wonderful cottage to walk the half mile to downtown Rangeley for breakfast, Stacy was as well, so she gave us a ride.  We had breakfast at the bagel shop and relaxed there for a while before slowly walking around town.  We napped in the afternoon and returned to downtown so I could use the coffee shop’s WiFi to update our journal.  Afterward, we went to the Red Onion for dinner - a big fresh veggie salad, liver and onions for me, pizza for Butterfly.  We then walked up to the IGA to get a sandwich for me to have tomorrow, as I will be slack packing 13 miles while Butterfly takes another day to heal her calf.  On the way, we again appreciated the sunset over Lake Rangeley.
Rangeley is by far the best trail town we have encountered this year.  Lots of good restaurants, very friendly people, an IGA grocery store.  We are both extremely grateful for this town and the great cottage we are staying in.","Rangeley

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601597,"Yesterday evening as we had dinner and then walked about Rangeley, Butterfly felt that her pulled calf muscle needed at least another day to heal, and she encouraged me to do a slack pack without her.  (Slack packing is when you hike with a very light load - just enough for a day hike.)  Fieldstone Hostel and Cottages provides shuttle services to and from the AT, and Stacy, the owner, said she could drop me off at Maine RT 17, so that I could do the 13.1 mile hike north bound to RT 4 where Butterfly and I finished on Thursday.
After coffee and breakfast sandwiches, Stacy and Butterfly dropped me off at the trailhead at Maine RT 17 at 8:20.  The trailhead is at an overlook of Lake Mooselookmeguntic (say that three times fast.)  This morning, the lake was shrouded in fog with the tops of islands peeking through.  Beautiful.
The section of trail I hiked today was in pretty good condition, at least by Maine standards.  It did not have a lot of elevation gain or loss, so it was an easy and fast hike.  I passed by several beautiful, serene lakes and ponds but did not go for a swim as I did not have a change of clothes (darn).  
Being a Saturday, there were more than the usual number of hikers on the trail.  I passed a young father taking his two young sons, ages about 6 and 7, out for an overnight and thought about my father taking my brother Paul and me up Virginia’s Old Rag Mountain for an overnight when we were young lads.  
I also met Half Slow - someone I had met on the PCT in 2015 near the top of Mt San Jacinto.  Half Slow is doing a supported through hike of the AT this year, and was walking south bound today.  I said hello as we passed, partially recognized him by his face but more definitively recognized him by his voice when he responded.  Neat guy.  We talked for about 10 minutes.  I explained Butterfly’s situation, and, as we departed, he gave me this for Butterfly off the top of his head:
All that is gold does not glitter.
Deep roots are not touched by the frost.
Couples that are strong do not wither,
And not all those who wander are lost.
I finished today’s hike at 2:40 and was in the shower at our cottage by 3.  Butterfly’s calf was still hurting and she was considering taking another zero for recovery.  After a short nap, we walked into Rangeley to get compression socks for Butterfly and some ice cream cones.  Surprise! - Lelu and Bruce Willis were at the ice cream place.  Bruce was very happy to see us - or maybe it was our ice cream cones he was so happy about.  We sat down with Lelu at a picnic table.  She had decided she was going to skip down to Connecticut because she was short on time and money and had had enough of Maine.  She had tentative plans for a shuttle to Andover, ME tomorrow and, knowing about Butterfly’s calf issues, asked if she wanted to share the shuttle.  So plans for tomorrow fell in place at the ice cream stand.  Laura will go to Andover by shuttle, and I’ll slack pack there from the same spot I was dropped at this morning.  
As the day waned, we walked up the hill to the IGA for a few items, stopping first at the overlook to take in the sun set (today’s picture).  In the IGA lot, we met Miss Janet, a trail angel with a van that drives up and down the trail each year.  I took a picture of the back of her van (see photos) which is covered in hiker related stickers.  Turns out she is helping Half Slow and he came out of the IGA a few minutes later.
Today was a good day with chance encounters and pleasant hike in the woods.  I am thankful for that and pray that Butterfly’s leg heals.","Rangeley

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601598,"Today I slack packed again - this time south bound from Maine RT 17 to South Arm Road where a shuttle picked me up and drove me to the Pine Ellis Hostel in Andover where Butterfly had been shuttled earlier in the day.  Stacy of Fieldstone Cottages again shuttled me to the trailhead.  We had a very nice stay at Fieldstone and thank Stacy and her crew for that.  
The hike today had some so-so views that I’m sure would have been better but for the clouds.  The hiking itself was tougher because of poor trail conditions, and I met several discouraged NoBo through hikers.  I talked with one of them, Pappa J from Tennessee who had started at the end of March and was contemplating quitting because “it’s just not fun anymore.”  He was fatigued and fed up with the Maine trails.  We talked for about 45 minutes near the top of Bemis Mountain’s second peak (there’s two summits on Bemis) and I encouraged him to eat more and to take his time.  I’m not sure I helped, but I sure hope you finish Pappa J.
Though today’s hike was about the same length as yesterday, it was much harder.  The last six tenths of a mile featured an 860 foot drop in the rain.  Not fun.  My knees are barking tonight.

Butterfly has gotten some KT tape and is doing all she can to help her calf heal, but it just takes time.  We went for a four mile walk on roads around Andover and her leg  loosened up and felt good after that, but she does not think she’s ready for the trail yet.  The plan is I will slack pack tomorrow and she will again do some road walking.  She does feel it healing, but does not want to do too much too fast.  If she is up to it, she will slack pack with me for about 10 miles on Wednesday.","Andover, ME

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602218,"I got an early (7:30) start on a tough 10 mile slack pack.  The first few miles were tough: steep, thousand foot ascent of Moody Mountain, really steep 1400 foot descent, then a steep 1600 foot ascent of Hall Mountain.  All that in 4.1 miles.  Average grade: 980 ft/mile.  I’m glad I was slack packing that portion of the trail.
From Hall Mountain to East B. Hill Road, the trail was actually pretty nice.  I stopped about an hour for lunch and still finished by 1:30.  There wasn’t much in the way of views today, and it was mostly cloudy all day.  My photo today was taken near the top of Moody Mt.  I love the way the low, early morning clouds wisp through the valleys and hug the mountains.
Butterfly is still not sure she’s going to be able to hike tomorrow.  On yesterday’s walk, she used light compression socks, and she thinks they helped.  She got a massage this morning, and the therapist spent a good deal of time on her hurt calf. She also went for a four mile road after I returned from my slack pack hike, and she used KT tape as suggested by Our good friend and Olympic Decathlon coach Josh Priester.  After her walk, she said it felt better, but not 100 %.  After taking a shower, Butterfly noticed that the knot in her calf was gone.  There was obvious fluid release on the side and back of her calf.  We’re not sure if this is good or bad.  
Our plan is to see if she can manage 10 miles of slack packing on the trail tomorrow.  We’ll start at East B Hill Road (where I finished today) and end at Grafton Notch (Maine RT 26).  The afternoon shuttle will have our backpacks. If she feels good after the 10 mile slack pack, we’ll continue about a mile from Grafton Notch to a stealth site for the night.  If her calf acts up again, we’ll head back to Andover and figure out what to do next.

We awoke at 5:45 and went to Mill Market for breakfast.  We were dropped of at about 7:30 at the trailhead and began the more gradual ascent (by Maine standards) of Baldplate Mountain.  We made good time and, thankfully, Butterfly’s calf was feeling good; according to Butterfly, it was 90 to 95 %.  At our mid-morning rest stop, I noticed a toad in a hole in a rock - today’s pic.
As we approached the summit of Baldplate’s East peak (it has two peaks) we met a young woman named Red (guess what color her hair is) who is SoBo - started at Katahdin August 11.  She’s really delightful, and we hiked with her much of the rest of the day.  
We arrived at Grafton Notch at 3:30 and got a little trail magic in the form of somewhat cold Pepsi’s that some nice angel had left in a cooler at the trail head.  Gloria, the shuttle driver, arrived at 4:00 with our backpacks, and we began phase two of the Butterfly calf test: hiking with a full backpack.  
The hike south from Grafton Notch to our intended campsite was only a mile, but it was about an 800 foot elevation gain, and I was keeping my fingers crossed that Butterfly’s calf would not give her any issues.  Fortunately, it didn’t, and she was able to move up the trail at her usual pace.
We are camped at a stealth site next to a brook about a third of the way up Old Speck Mountain.  Red set up her hammock a few hundred feet up trail from us, but came down and cooked dinner with us.  We heard thunder as we ate, the wind picked up, and it started to rain at 7:15.  We grabbed everything, jumped in the tent and listened to Huckleberry Finn and the rain on the tent.

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602220,"The forecast yesterday indicated a chance of thunderstorms between 5 and 7 PM followed by clear skies and cooling temperatures, going down to the upper 40s, overnight.  The thunderstorm began at 7:15 and turned into intermittent showers that lasted well into this morning.  We were hot and sticky in our tent much of the night, and while the temps did drop toward morning, I don’t think they ever got below 60 degrees.
We took the morning rain as a sign to sleep in.  The rain ended at about 8 and we got on the trail at 10.  We began by climbing the remaining 1700 feet up Old Speck Mountain.  Butterfly powered up the 2.6 mile hill beautifully, summiting shortly after noon where we were greeted by strong winds and wet clouds.  We got off the summit as quickly as we could - which was 1.25 mph at best due to slippery, sloping, rocky trail conditions.  We stopped in at Speck Pond Shelter for lunch - beautiful spot and beautiful new shelter.  After contemplating staying there for the night, we chose to move on and tackle The Arm as it was still before 3.
The Arm is a very steep potion of the trail which, since we’re Southbound, we had to go down.  It a 1600 foot drop in 1.5 miles.  It was very slow going as expected.  Near the bottom, we crossed a brook where we filled all our water containers and then hiked 3 tenths of a mile to a great campsite.  After finishing The Arm, Butterfly said her calf is feeling good.
We’re sharing the site tonight with a young, through-hiking couple that did the Mahoosuc Notch today.  The Mahoosuc Notch is considered the toughest and/or the funnest section of the trail.  It’s 1 mile of huge boulders piled up in a ravine between two very steep mountains, and hikers have to climb over. Under and around them.  We’ll do the Notch first thing in the morning.  Butterfly has been anxious about the Notch for some time based on its description and some accounts from NoBos.  The couple we are sharing the site with tonight say it was fun.

We left camp at 8:50 and started the Mahoosuc Notch shortly after 9.  The Notch is a deep ravine between two mountains that’s piled high with boulders of all shapes and sizes that hikers need to climb over, under and through.  Butterfly had been anxious for days about the Notch - anxiety stoked by stories from NoBos who had already done it, but also because of her calf issue.  As it turned out, it was a lot of fun for both of us and took us two hours and ten minutes to complete.  (Butterfly would like me to note that our time would have been under two hours if I hadn’t stopped to talk to so many people.)

After getting through it, we climbed out of the Notch - pretty much straight up - 950 feet in a mile.  Once atop Fulling Mill Mountain, Butterfly asked why this climb didn’t have a name.  I suggested, and she accepted, “The Nostril” - after she rejected my first suggestion.
Much of today’s hike was ridge walking between Fulling Mill Mountain and the various peaks of Goose Eye Mountain - the North, East and West peaks.  All are balds.  The weather was excellent and we could see Mt Washington to the southwest and places that we’ve hiked already to the northeast.  A freshman orientation group from Bates College shared the trail with us and we played leap frog with them throughout the afternoon all the way to Carlo Col Shelter and Campground.  Our picture today is courtesy of one of the students who offered to take our picture at lunch.
In part because of the beauty of the day and the hike, we took our time and arrived at Carlo Col Shelter about 20 minutes before sunset.  I set up the tent on a wood platform at the site while Laura got and purified water.  We cooked dinner in the waning daylight and were in the tent shortly after eight.  It’s going to be pretty cool tonight.  We still have just one sleeping bag which we use as a quilt, but tonight is really too cool for this approach.  I’ll be getting my sleeping bag in a couple days, but tonight am kept warm by my puffy.

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602560,"Today was an epic day.  It began with some bad luck.
We thought we were pretty well prepared last night when we went to bed thinking that we could get up at 6 and be ready to go on the 7 AM shuttle from Rattle River Lodge to Pinkham Notch.  We were ready for the shuttle, but somehow this morning felt discombobulated.  Zeroes in trail towns can do that; breaking the routine of trail life can cause confusion.  And several things that happened added to that sense.  First, after we were dropped off, I realized that my pocketknife had fallen out of the front pocket of my pants in the van.  Secondly, as we discussed the plan for leaving the White Mountains next week, I panicked for a few minutes thinking that we had sent our tent too far ahead on our journey.  (We don’t need our tent for the next seven nights because we will be staying in the AMC huts and a shelter before getting to Glencliff, NH, and I want to travel as light as possible.)  I had forgotten the logic of why it made sense to forward the tent all the way to Glencliff.     Next, we had a hard time finding the trailhead to head south from Pinkham Notch.  And finally, it started raining an hour into our hike . . . and it rained and rained and rained.  
The forecast was for two to three hours of showers followed by clearing skies and cooler temperatures.  When the air temperature is above 60 degrees and it rains, I put on my pack cover (Laura’s pack is waterproof), and we just hike in our hiking clothes and get wet.  There’s little sense in putting on our rain gear because, if we did, we’d get soaked from perspiration.  Today’s hike was from Pinkham Notch at 2000 feet up and over Mount Madison at 5400 feet.  When we started at 8:30, the air temp was 65 degrees.  The first five miles were in the valley and, though we were wet, the physical exertion of hiking was enough to keep us warm.  At around 11:20. The trail took a left turn and started up Mount Madison.  Shortly after we’d begun the climb, we passed a young man going the other way with eyes as big as saucers who said, “I wouldn’t be going up there if I were you.  It’s an exposed ridge.  I got hailed on.  Lightning was striking all around me.  The rain was coming up at me because of the wind, and the wind is blowing at 60 to 70 miles an hour with gusts well above that.  I weigh 185 pounds and it picked me up and moved me.”  I said, “Thanks for the report,” while registering the alarm in Laura’s eyes.
Not long afterward, we ran into another hiker coming down off the mountain and we asked him, “How was it up there?”  He gave a similar picture - that it had hailed, there had been lightning strikes and that it had been very windy, though he was far less alarmist than the first guy we talked to.  
About a third of the way into the climb, I suggested to Laura that we stop and eat lunch.  Though at first disinclined to stop, she agreed that she needed energy to make it up the mountain.  We dined our raincoats for warmth and stood by the side of the trail in the rain eating our Italian sub and chips.  As we finished up lunch, Laura looked at my incredulously and asked, “What are we doing?”  I replied, “We’re going to Madison Spring Hut.”  “But what if it’s really bad up there?” she asked.  I responded that a) the forecast was for the storm to break up after 2 to 3 hours so it probably won’t be as bad this afternoon as it was this morning, and b) if it is really bad once we get to the tree line, we can turn around and go back down.  “Oh, right” said Laura. “Like that’s ever going to happen.”
Shortly after we resumed our hike, a young woman through hiker weighing 125 pounds at most met us coming down the trail.  In contrast to the first guy we met, she smiled and asked how are day was going.  She said that the hail and lightning had been a bit unnerving, but that the storm hadn’t been that bad.  Laura asked about the wind up top, and she said that, yes, the wind is strong, but if you keep a low profile you’ll be fine.  This assuaged Laura’s concern somewhat.
About twenty minutes later we met a couple from the DC area who said, “You should be alright.”  As we parted, the woman said, “I’ll be praying for you.”  
Finally, just before we got to the tree line, we encountered a couple in their 70s.  They had spent last night at Madison Spring Hut and were doing the reverse of our hike for the day.  The gentleman of the couple had injured his right shoulder a day or so earlier so could not use his right arm.  He’d also fallen earlier in the day on top of Mt Madison and cut his cheek.  Though moving slowly, they had made it over Madison, and Laura commented that maybe it’s not so bad after all.
So we pressed on steadily into the clouds and wind above the tree line.  The rain had stopped, but visibility was maybe 200 feet.  The trail, if it can be called a trail, was nothing but large, wet rocks with few flat surfaces.  Fortunately, the rocks were not slippery.  Large rock cairns marked the way; there were few white blazes. After climbing about five false summits, I thought to myself, “Well, this next one must be the real summit.”  I checked the Guthook’s Guide on my iPhone to see where we were.  We had more than 500 feet to go.  Bummer.
We kept on, slowly but surely.  The wind was 20 to 40 mph and was mostly crosswind so didn’t cause us to work much harder.  On several occasions, we had to stop and steady ourselves against particularly strong gusts.  About 10 minutes shy of the summit, I noticed a good sized patch of cranberries right next to a large blueberry patch.  I got pictures of both but we didn’t sample them.  At 2:45, we finally reached the actual summit of Mt Madison where we paused briefly for a selfie.  
As we began the descent, the sun broke through the clouds, and for about five minutes we saw blue sky above us.  The descent to the hut was only four tenths of a mile, but it was quite steep and all rocks and boulders.  At about 2:30, we finally entered the warmth and protection of Madison Spring Hut.
The hut’s guest capacity is 52 and there are 36 guests expected tonight.  It was rebuilt in 2011 and it’s spacious and light.  We are in a bunk room with nine bunks and three other guests, so we have room for a clothes line to attempt to dry our wet hiking clothes.  We relaxed in the warmth of the common area in the afternoon and enjoyed the company of some of the other guests.
Dinner was pumpkin soup, salad, lasagna,  green beans, focaccia bread and chocolate chip brownies for dessert.  I had two pieces of lasagna.  After dinner, while listening to the naturalists talk on weather in the White Mountains, the sky began to clear and we were treated to an incredible sunset that lasted for what seemed like an hour.
Days like today really make me feel alive.  I am thankful for the challenge of getting here, that we made it safely, and for ibuprofen for our sore knees.  I am thankful for everything about this Hut and for the incredible sunset.  And most of all, I am thankful that I could share it all with Butterfly.","Pinkham Notch

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602561,"Today’s hike took us along the ridge of the presidential range past Mounts Adams, Jefferson, Clay and up to the summit of Mt Washington at 6288 feet.  The entire hike was above the tree line, so we had great views all day long.
The crew at each of the AMC Huts provides the day’s weather forecast after breakfast each morning.  Today was perhaps the best day of the year on the ridge.  Visibility, at 110 miles, was the best this year.  It was sunny all day with temperatures in the 50s and 60s, light winds and no chance of rain.  It was a perfect day. 
We hiked with Wet Sticks off and on during the day.  Wet Sticks is a flip flop through hiker from Tennessee who’s trail name comes from his ability to get fires going - even with wet sticks - for the first 26 days of his hike.  He’s a particularly outgoing guy who recognized that there’s nothing like a good fire to get people to come together and open up to one another.  Kudos to Wet Sticks for that.
Hiking on the ridge is slow because it’s mostly rocks but the trail is well maintained.  There are plenty of flat rocks to step on - not the random arrangement of yesterday’s trail. We took our time and enjoyed the views.  , but reached Mt Washington for lunch, leaving 1.4 miles from summit to the Lakes of the Clouds Hut on the saddle between Mt Washington and Mt Monroe.  
After lunch in the cafeteria at the summit, we checked out the museum.  The weather station on Mt Washington in 1937 recorded the highest velocity surface winds on record: 231 mph.  The summit of Mt Washington is sunny only 40 days a year on average.  Today was not an average day on Mt Washington.
We arrived at the hut at about 3:30 and I secured the best bunks I could in a bunk room that sleeps 18.  After relaxing outside in the sun - drying clothes that were still wet from yesterday and letting our feet get some fresh air - we enjoyed a dinner of black bean soup, salad, garlic bread, chicken, couscous, vegetables and white cake for dessert.  The sunset was again spectacular from this vantage, though perhaps not as special to us as last night’s. 
Butterfly and I turned in early - shortly before 8.  I worked on my journal a bit and then nodded off.  I was awoken at 11:45 by snoring, so took the opportunity to finish today’s entry and attempt to upload yesterday’s and today’s.  Unfortunately, the cell signal here in the bunk room isn’t strong enough, so the uploading will have to wait until tomorrow.  Meanwhile, I’m listening to Aaron Copeland’s Appalachian Spring - kind of appropriate.","Madison Spring Hut

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602562,"Despite a snoring impacted, restless night of sleep, we were up at 6:30 for coffee and breakfast in the hut.  Not that we had any choice in the matter - the crew awakens everyone at that time.  Breakfast was filling - though not hot.  The temperature outside at sunrise was in the 30s, so perhaps it was difficult for the cooking crew to keep the bottles hot in the unheated hut.  I’m not complaining - just painting a picture of life in the huts.  It’s a luxury anytime breakfast is made for you on the trail.
We got started on our hike shortly after breakfast, but first bought a pair of warm gloves for Butterfly and an AMC fleece hat for me at the hut.  It was in the low forties and pretty windy when we started hiking today, and we needed the extra warmth.  We were again above the tree line for the morning and off and on in the afternoon.  We side-straddled Mounts Monroe and Eisenhower, and we summited Pierce, Jackson and Webster on the 3800 foot descent from Lakes of the Clouds Hut to Crawford Notch.  The total elevation loss today was 5200 feet - tough on 58 year old knees, though getting somewhat easier.  We stopped at Mizpah Hut for lunch - mushroom barley and vegetable soup from the hut with triscuits, pepperoni and other snacks from our food bag.  
Today was “Flags on 48 Day” here in New Hampshire.  It’s a 9/11 commemoration tradition occurring on the Saturday before 9/11 each year in which service members, veterans, firemen and citizens raise the flag on all 48 of New Hampshire‘s mountains of elevation greater than 4000 feet.  As a result, there were a lot of people on the trail today.  The excellent weather brought out people as well.  We got a picture with the flag and the fireman’s flag on Mt Jackson.
We got to US Route 302 at Crawford Notch after descending 2700 feet from Mt Webster in 3.4 miles.  The d scent was not as frustrating as many of the descents we encountered in Maine.  It’s obvious that there’s more trail maintenance on the well travelled trails in the White Mountains.  We got to the trailhead at about 5:30 and hitch hiked to the AMC Highland Center approximately 5 miles up the Notch.  Arriving just before dinner, we quickly showered and had a wonderful dinner of baked haddock, gnocchi in a cream sauce, macaroni and cheese, salad, blueberry pie and a very nice Pinot.
Tonight I am thankful for beautiful fall weather, for our country, for the Highland Center and for a great phone conversation with our daughter a Kathryn and son in law Scotty after dinner.","Lakes of the Clouds Hut

Butterfly slept in.  Had breakfast at 8:30 and slowly got ready to go.  Left hotel at ~10:30 and hitch hiked back to trail head.  Second car that passed stopped and gave us a ride.  Yay! 
Trail conditions were great today.  Started hiking at 10:50 and got to Hut at 3:10.  Lunch was next to a mountain stream.
The volunteer naturalist at Zealand Hut, Joanne, gave an interesting talk on history of Zealand valley and Crawford Notch.  Turns out the reason the trail was so nice this afternoon is that it’s a railroad bed from the late 19th century when a lumber company clear cut this valley.  
Had dinner with 3 guys from GA who have been section hiking the AT for several years: Last Mile, Bull, Jammer.  After JoAnne’s talk, they shared a nip of bourbon with us.","Crawford Notch
",Zealand Falls Hut ,"Sep 09, Sun",7.70
Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602925,"Yesterday’s forecast for today called for a cloudy morning with an increasing chance of rain showers after 11 AM.  With only 7 miles to hike to Galehead Hut, we left Zealand Falls right after breakfast to try to beat the rain.  Today’s hike, while short from a mileage perspective, was slow because much of the trail was rocky.  The rocks varied in size from that of a football to that of a car and required thought with every footstep.  We began with a long uphill (1000 feet in a mile) up to a gradual uphill ridge over Zealand, Guyot and South Twin Peaks, and we ended with a steep descent (1200 feet in 0.8 miles) to Galehead Hut.  The wind on the top of the exposed South Twin peak were very strong.  Fortunately, the walk across the peak was short, and we were soon back below the tree line.  
After arriving at the Hut around 1:15, we had our lunch of pita pockets with tuna and cheese.  The wind howled all afternoon - sustained wind of 20 to 30 mph with gusts to 50.  Still chilled from our hike, we got in my bunk using my sleeping bag as a quilt and listened to Huckleberry Finn on Laura’s iPhone.   It didn’t take long for us to fall asleep.  We napped until 4:30 and watched the rain begin through the window of our bunkhouse.
After our nap, the naturalist lead a very nice poetry session attended by ourselves, two other couples and the naturalist from the Carter Notch Hut who was visiting for the afternoon.  At the end we composed a poem by playing the poetry fame - each person adding a line but only seeing the one line written by the person before them.  
Dinner was a very yummy brazed beef stew on rice with veggies, pumpkin soup and salad.  Very satisfying and warming.  All told, there are only nine guests plus three work-for-stay through hikers here tonight.  We’re glad we’re inside as the winds continue to be strong and the temperature is in the upper 40s outside.  
Tonight we are thankful to be under a roof, for a cozy afternoon nap and for the good dinner.","Zealand Falls Hut 
",Galehead Hut,"Sep 10, Mon",7
Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603232,"The wind blew hard all night, and it looked cold and wet outside this morning, so we bundled up and put on rain gear.  When we stepped out onto the front porch of Galehead Hut, however, we found it was warmer than inside so we immediately took off our hats and gloves.  A quarter of a mile down the trail, we took off our raincoats and I took off my long sleeve wool shirt.  The air was very still - no wind at all - and we were in the clouds.  The temperature was about 60. This is pretty much how it was all day until we got to the summit of Mt Lafayette (5260 ft).  At that point, the wind picked up a bit, the sun broke through and the fog/clouds lifted.  The hike down to Greenleaf Hut was 1000 feet in 1.1 miles.  It’s pretty well maintained trail, but still took us about an hour to do.
There are only two other guests here tonight- a couple our age from Montreal - and one work-for-stay hiker (Shocktop).  Consequently, Butterfly and I have a 24 bed bunkroom to ourselves.  Shouldn’t be any snoring issues tonight.
In the summer of 1976 my mom and dad brought me, my sister Kristin and younger brother Brendan to the White Mountains for several nights.  We spent a night in Lonesome Lake Hut, hiked to Greenleaf Hut and spent two nights and then hiked back to Lonesome Lake by an alternative route for the fourth night.  It was a great trip.  On that trip, the views from Franconia Ridge were fantastic, and I remember that the sunset viewed from Greenleaf was also spectacular.  Now, the huts have log books with guest entries dating back to the 1950s.  After dinner tonight, I got the 1976 log book off the shelf and searched page by page beginning in July to see if any of us had made an entry.  I found one on August 17, made by my sister. I took a photo of it and sent it to her for her birthday, but won’t include the photo in my journal so as not to embarrass her.
We are thankful that today’s hike was rain free, for another good dinner in an AMC hut and that we will have a quiet bunk room tonight.","Galehead Hut
",Greenleaf Hut,"Sep 11, Tue",6.60
Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603233,"We left Greenleaf Hut at 8:20 and began today’s hike with a 1.1 mile, thousand foot climb back to top of Lafayette.  (Since the climb back was not on the AT, it’s not included in today’s mileage tally.). With Butterfly in the lead, this took us 50 minutes (she’s faster going up than down).  We then turned south and walked along Franconia ridge from Mount Lafayette to Lincoln to Little Haystack to Liberty.  Franconia Ridge is above the tree line, and the views from it are wonderful - when it’s clear.  We were in the clouds for much of our walk, though they parted from time to time allowing views to the west.  From the shoulder of Mt Liberty (the AT doesn’t go quite to the summit) the trail descends 2800 feet in 2.8 miles to Franconia Notch.  The descent was slow going - especially the first 2200 feet in 1.7 miles - and we stopped for lunch on the way down.  After passing under I-93 at the bottom, we began a gradual ascent to Lonesome Lake Hut on the other side of the Notch.  The trail was really nice (see picture) most of the way up, and we made good time.  We would have liked to stay at Lonesome Lake, but it was sold out to a  group of school children and chaperones.  We did stop in for water and a snack, and I checked the 1976 log book as well.  There were entries authored by me and my sister for both nights we stayed there.  Today’s pic is the entry from our first night, August 16, 1976.
We left the hut at about 5 for a 2 mile uphill to Kinsman Pond Shelter.  The second mile was a steep scramble that frustrated both of us, though the AMC has put a lot of work into making it easier (eg; blocks of wood secured to the rock faces for steps).  We arrived at the shelter at 6:30 and met a nice couple our age out for a few nights.  This will be only our second night in a trail shelter.","Greenleaf Hut

Looking north and east, we could see where we’d been the last couple days including Mt Moosilauke and Lake Tarleton.  
The descent from Smarts was of the typical New Hampshire annoying variety, so we took it slow.  We climbed up to Holt’s Ledge after lunch.  The views were OK but partially obscured by growing cloud cover.  Interestingly, the forecast this morning had a chance of rain for early tomorrow morning, but when I checked the forecast on Holt’s Ledge, it indicated now chance of rain tonight or tomorrow.  After a slow descent from Holt’s Ledge, we found a good stealth site right next to Hewes Brook and set up around 6.  We had time to bathe before dinner and got into the tent at dusk (which is getting earlier and earlier).  We can see the half moon through the trees.

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604121,"I awoke at 5:55 and got up to take care of some urgent business.  It was still dark so I used my headlamp to guide me, and it revealed a heavy mist moving through the forest.  Wait a minute . . . The forecast last night indicated that today would be sunny and clear all day.  So much for forecasting in New England.  I got my food bag out of the bear box, returned to my tent, got back into my sleeping bag and made coffee and egg drop soup (ramen with two fresh eggs poached in it) from the comfort of my bed as the sky lightened.  Sunrise was at 6:53. 
After breakfast, I packed up and changed into my hiking clothes which I had hung up to dry yesterday when I arrived at the campsite.  Thanks to the mist, they were now a good deal wetter than when I hung them up 12 hours earlier.  I hit the trail at 8:05 and immediately climbed 700 feet in 1.2 miles to the summit of Mt Everett - the last 500 feet in 0.6 miles.  The visibility was about 200 feet, so the view from the summit, where the trees were 8 to 12 feet tall, was spectacular :-).  The descent, 700 feet in 0.7 miles over wet rocks was also challenging, but kinda fun.  It was cute, I thought to myself: Massachusetts trying to be The White Mountains or Maine.  Mt Everett was followed by Mt Race; easier up and down but similar open summit and stunning views of dense water vapor.
After descending from Mt Race, I traversed Sages ravine which is parallel to and close to the MA/CT boarder.  The trail is parallel to and crosses Sawmill Brook in the ravine, and the recent rains had swollen the brook to the point that it had to be forded rather than rock-hopped across.  Massachusetts AT trying to be Maine again.  Very cute.  It did slow me down, though.  On the south side of the ford is an erroneous sign claiming to be the MA/CT boarder, and, since the real boarder is not marked, I decided to take a selfie there (today’s picture).
After crossing the state line, I climbed up Bear Mountain - 800 feet in 0.7 miles.  Connecticut trying to be Maine or The Whites.  How very cute!  Bear Mountain, it turns out, is the highest point in Connecticut at 2316 feet.  The summit was enveloped in clouds.
Despite being not all that high, it seemed that there would have been some nice views from Mt Everett, Race Mountain and Bear Mountain.  It being a Saturday either forecasted clear skies, there were quite a few locals out for day hikes.  All lamented the cloud cover.  Perhaps we’ll have to come back and do this section on a clear day.
I ate lunch at Brassie Brook Shelter and enjoyed the company of 6 guys with the Connecticut Appalachian Mountain Club who had come up to the shelter to clean out the moldering privy and some maintenance on the shelter.  Oh boy! What a fun job!  Thanks very much guys.  We hikers really appreciate your work.  
The afternoon hike was mostly level or downhill, with a little uphill after passing near Salisbury, CT.  The town, 0.8 miles from the trail, was having its fall festival, but I did not go in as I didn’t need anything material and did need the time for hiking.  With sunset getting earlier and earlier, I’m trying to get to camp no later than 5:30 now.  
I arrived at Limestone Spring Shelter after hiking down 240 feet on a half-mile side trail.  There’s a beautiful waterfall next to the side trail and the shelter site is also beautiful.  There’s an excellent spring right by the shelter as well.  I’m the only one in the shelter tonight.  I’ve opted for staying in the shelter as there’s a 30 % chance of rain tonight starting at midnight.  It is now 9:20 PM and the rain had begun.  Sigh.  I’m dry, well fed and enjoying the sounds of the summer insects in the forest and rain drops on the shelter roof.","Glen Brook Shelter

I hiked 3 miles to the turn off to Falls Village and walked a few tenths of a mile to the Toymaker’s Cafe for a breakfast of eggs Benedict.  Got back on trail at 9:45.  Walked along the Housatonic for a few miles, then up into the hills.  Though not a rainy day, the sky was overcast and there were few decent views until the end of the day.

Again, Connecticut trying to be Maine.
Caught up to Templeton hiking with his step father and then caught up to Steve - a section hiker from NYC - late in the day.  Steve and I walked from the trail to the Bull Bridge Tavern and had dinner there.  I changed into drier clothes and cleaned up in the men’s room beforehand, as I was s mess.  Afterwards, we nighthiked the 1.2 miles to Ten River Shelter.","Cornwall Bridge

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604742,"Another wet morning and lots of squishy trail.  Though I had gone into and back out of New York yesterday, today I left Connecticut for good and will be in NY for several days.  I hiked through a number of fields. When I arrived at NY RT 22, a guy in a pickup truck pulled over and asked if I needed a ride to Pawling.  I jumped at the opportunity as I needed to get contact lense solution and thought I’d get lunch in town.  Had a great lunch from Vinny’s deli.  Very friendly and awesome food.  But, getting back to the trail was not easy and I ended up walking the 2.6 miles back to the trail, arriving at the trailhead at 3 PM with 11 miles to go to Morgan Stewart Shelter.  I hiked fast, but ended up having to night hike the last two miles.  I had a hard time finding the shelter in the dark, but got there thanks to Guthook’s and GPS.   I had the shelter to myself.   I got water from the hand pump and talked to Butterfly by phone while making dinner.","Ten Mile River Shelter

Turns out it was a fraternity brother from The College of William and Mary named Ken Holder who graduated the same year Butterfly and I did.  Small world.  
I had a choice of doing 14 miles to Canopus Lake or 28 miles to Graymoor Spiritual Life Center.  Easy choice.  There’s nobody at Canopus Lake.  The facilities (bathrooms - including cold showers, access to water) are open, though everything else is closed for the season.  Hikers are supposed to camp in a field about a half mile from the facilities and the beach.  I made dinner on picnic tables right outside the facilities and concession stand, and I’m camped on the beach.  It’s quite warm - 74 at bed time - and as the sun set, clouds moved in and the humidity increased. 
It’s supposed to rain most of the day tomorrow, starting mid-morning.  I am going to stay at the Bear Mountain Inn which is 21 trail miles from here.  I’ve set my alarm for 6.  Lets see how quickly I can get out of camp.","Morgan Stewart Shelter

It was also very windy and warm, and the rain felt refreshing compared to sweat.
It rained continuously all afternoon, and I didn’t stop for lunch until reaching the Appalachian Deli just past the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center.  Met Dirty Shot and Long Squat at the deli trying to wait out the rain.

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605101,"Tommyhawk fetched his food and mine from the bear box at the shelter just before my alarm went off at 5:30.  We each prepared our breakfasts from the comfort of our sleeping bags in the shelter.  Butterfly’s combination thermometer, compass and whistle said it was 35 degrees, but, fortunately, there was little wind.  Sunrise is now several minutes past seven, and the sky doesn’t begin to lighten until 6:30, so we did most of our morning routines in the dark.  Because Tommyhawk had arrived at the shelter yesterday during daylight hours, he knew where the privy was.  Otherwise, I would have never found it as there’s no sign pointing in the right direction and no real trail to it either.  I think this is because the shelter is brand new.  It’s a really nice shelter, so no complaints from me.
We got on the trail at about 7:15.  Like yesterday, there was hardly a cloud in the sky, and the cool temperatures invited sweat-free, brisk hiking.  The plan that I put together last weekend at Bear mountain had me going about twenty miles to the Backpacker Campground, but Tommyhawk and I discussed the possibility of pushing on to Delaware Water Gap.  The days hike was along the same ridge as yesterday’s, with occasional little dips and rises to views of the valleys on both sides.  The walking was easy and we made good time.  We hiked up Rattlesnake Mountain, by Rattlesnake Spring and through Rattlesnake Swamp with no snake sightings.  At Kittatinny Mountain, we met a group of bird watchers recording raptor sightings.  We stopped and chatted for a while, and I recognized one of the guys, named Tom, from yesterday at Sunrise Mountain where he was hawk watching.  As we talked, two bald eagles glided passed.  Neat.
We walked along the rocky shores of Sunfish Pond around 4:30 - water and sky were crystal clear.  With 6 miles to Delaware Water Gap, we considered staying at the Backpacker Campsite just passed the Pond, but the thought eating town food and having a roof over our heads and on a night predicted to hit 32 degrees, and the fact that most of those miles were on forest roads and paved roads, spurred us onward.  We passed a couple trout fishermen along amply flowing Dunnfield Creek on our descent into the gap, and then walked along Old Mine Road and over the Delaware River on a bridge that bounced up and down significantly every time a semi flew passed.
We arrived at the Church of the Mountain Hiker Center at 6:20 - just after sunset.  The lights were out, but there were three, full backpacks there suggesting that we had company there.  After setting our stuff on bunks and showering, we headed out for dinner at the Sycamore Grill.  On our walk there, we ran into the owners of the three backpacks: Red Eye, Guru Bob and Megatrash Poptart (Mega for short).  After introductions and chatting a bit, Mega informed us that he had staked a bunk claim with a green carabiner.  Oops . . . thinking the carabiner was left by someone inadvertently, I had taken over his claim.  I explained as much to Mega and suggested that he simply move my stuff.  He said no worries, there are plenty of bunks and that he’d take another.
Dinner was French onion soup, the steak and ale special and a salad.  Upon returning to the hostel, I got ready for bed.  As I did so, I found some Exofficio underwear mixed in with my clothes.  I thought perhaps they belonged to either Dirty Gulp or Long Squat whose laundry I had done at Bear River - that perhaps I had mixed them in with my clothes inadvertently, so I tossed them on the bunk above mine.  Turns out, Mega had played a practical joke on me and had added them to my clothes pile when Tommyhawk and I were eating.  We all got a good laugh out of that one.  
Tonight I am thankful for a hiking companion, excellent weather, good trail, the generosity of The Presbyterian Church of The Mountain and good humor.","Brink Road Shelter

Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605102,"Had breakfast at the pie place with Tommyhawk. Got on the trail at 10 AM with a goal of getting to Wind Gap, 15 and a half miles down the ridge.  Guru and Mega had headed out while Tommyhawk and I had breakfast.  Tommyhawk needed to go to the outfitter which was closed on weekdays but the owner had agreed to open up for Tommyhawk.  Anyway, Tommyhawk and Red Eye left after I did, so the five of us were strung out over several miles across the ridge.
This section begins with a roughly 1000 foot climb up from the Deleware River.  An hour and a half into today’s hike, I checked my mileage on Guthook’s and saw that I was 0.2 miles passed the 900 mile point.  I stopped and made a “900” in the middle of the trail and documented the accomplishment.  
I stopped for lunch at Kirkridge Shelter at 12:20.  Lunch was a couple of peanut butter and trail mix wraps (see photo) and some Triscuits with cheese.  
Trail lore has it that the trail in north eastern Pennsylvania is really rocky.  I’ve been dreading this for some time but not really sure what is meant by “really rocky”  having not yet experienced it yet.  The going was fast for the first few miles after lunch as the trail was predominantly smooth with a few rocky parts.  Once I got to a point a few tenths from Wolf Rocks, however, it became the opposite: mostly rocky trail with a few smooth patches.  For six miles the trail was flat but very rocky,  not really large boulder that you walk up and over, but smallish rocks that either moved when you stepped on them or were pointy and fixed in the ground and hurt to step on.  The rocks put me in a pretty sour mood.  At one point, I tripped on one of the sharp pointy rocks and reopened the wound on my left hand from Monday’s fall in NY. To get revenge, I took a large belly sized rock and smashed it down on the point of the offending, pointy rock.  To my satisfaction, it broke.
After the six mile rocky section, I descended into Wind Gap.  I caught up to Mega at 4:20 just before the trailhead at PA RT 33, and then Guru at the trailhead.  I told them I had a room at the Gateway Motel a couple tenths north on PA 33, and offered to share it with them if they didn’t mind sleeping on the floor and letting me have the room from 5 to about 6:30 for a teleconference I needed to attend.  The two of them weren’t sure at that point what their plans for the night were, but they left their packs in the room and took an Uber into the town of Wind Gap for dinner.  I joined them after my teleconference at the Beer Stein. I also did laundry at the laundromat and did a minor resupply at the convenience store across from the Beer Stein. 
We took a Lyft back to the motel at about 9:30, and by that point, Guru and Mega had decided to sleep on the floor of the room.  The guy in the room next to us was had his tunes turned up a bit loud, so I turned the AC unit’s fan on.
Tonight I am thankful that I’ve completed 6 miles of Pennsylvania’s rocky trail, I’m thankful for a roof over my head and for companionship.  I pray that the trail ahead isn’t mile after mile of what I experienced late afternoon today.","Delaware Water Gap
",Wind Gap,"Oct 19, Fri",15.50
Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605103,"I awoke at 6:30 and tried to quietly get dressed and gather my stove, water, instant coffee packet, ramen and eggs and go onto the front porch of the motel room to make breakfast.  I think I was successful in allowing Guru and Mega to get a few more winks.  After breakfast, I heard Guru moving around in the room and the three of us gradually did our morning things.  As we completed our packing, I opened the room door and a few seconds later, Tommyhawk showed up in the doorway.  He’d spent the night a couple miles back on the trail and had come over to the motel for water.
A few minutes later at about 8:30, we were all heading back to the trail for a short ascent back to the ridge with Guru in the lead.  Guru, Tommyhawk and I walked together all morning and much of the afternoon.  The weather was cool and overcast most of the day.  Red Eye and his dad - who joined Red Eye for most of the day - caught up to us at lunch and Red Eye’s dad snapped today’s photo.  
At 2:50 we reached a thinly used side trail to Blue Mountain Resort - a ski resort with a large lodge near the summit.  A couple day hikers that we met earlier in the afternoon had provided very good instruction on how to get to the lodge.  We headed over to the lodge for an early dinner of burgers and endless fries.  Mega showed up as we were eating and joined the party.  We all then struggled somewhat with getting back on trail - contemplating whether or not to camp nearby and return for the costume party at 8.  Prizes were to be awarded for the most creative, best couple, fan favorite, scariest, sexiest costumes.  I felt certain that with our buff hiker bodies, beards and hiker eau de cologne that one of us was bound to win sexiest.  Alas, we decided to press on.
We had hoped to make it to George W. Outerbridge Shelter on the other side of Lehigh Gap, but we left the ski resort around 4:30 with seven miles to go.  Instead, we hiked about a mile further to a very nice stealth site.  We all got set up for the night and pretty much got into our tents or hammocks right away as it was cold and a steady wind was making it colder.  I massaged my feet for a while and then attempted to work on my journal, but fell asleep before writing twenty words.  
The trail was rocky in parts today, but there were no several mile long stretches like yesterday.  Or, if there were long stretches, the good conversations we had took my mind off of the rocks.","Wind Gap
",Stealth Site near Palmerton at 927.7,"Oct 20, Sat",16
Huckleberry and Butterfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605104,"I set my alarm for 5:30 this morning, but, because I’d fallen asleep at about 7, I was wide awake at 12:50 AM.  I read for a while and played Sudoku on my phone and eventually fell back to sleep.  At 5:30, I got coffee and breakfast going from the comfort of my sleeping bag.  This is a dry stealth site, so I used some of the two liters I carried from the ski lodge yesterday.  
It had rained a bit overnight and continued to drizzle now and again as I went through my morning routines.  At 7:45, Tommyhawk and I donned our packs and bid adieu to Guru and Mega who were just beginning to stir in their hammocks.  From our stealth site, we passed by the Palmerton Super Fund site.  Beginning in 1912, Palmerton was the location of zinc smelting plants whose smokestacks belted our large quantities of heavy metals for decades.  The result: the portion of blue mountain above Palmerton was completely defoliate.  Palmerton was added to the list of EPA Superfund sites in 1983.  Revegetation of over 3000 acres of Blue Mountain began in the 1990s and is continuing.  Three miles of the AT weee relocated from the ridge of Blue Mountain and currently pass above Palmerton on very smooth trail below the ridge.  As we walked this portion of the trail, we could see skeletons of trees that had been dead for a long time, but we could also see that trees and other plants were making a comeback.  Hopefully, the comeback will be complete in a couple generations or so, though I suspect it will be a few hundred years at least before drinking water from these hills is safe.
After passing the Superfund site, the AT descends rapidly and rocking to the Lehigh River.  Thanks to Tommyhawk who captured today’s photo of me near the top of this descent.  Note the perfect hiker form and no butt crack - let alone butt.  The descent was nothing in comparison to many of the steep, rocky descents of Maine and New Hampshire.  Though technical in a few spots - meaning I tossed my hiking pole down and climbed down backwards - the tough portion of the trail was short and lasted less than 10 or 15 minutes.
Once we were down in Lehigh Gap, we crossed the river and ascended back to the ridge.  There was little elevation gain or loss for the rest of the day.  We lunched at Bake Oven Knob Shelter.  There were a lot of day hikers out, it being a beautiful, though windy, October Sunday afternoon, and there were also a number of bird watchers.  As cool as it was (temperatures in the forties) we did see a small snake and a box turtle today.  I neglected to get a photo of the snake.  It was moving very slowly, and both a Tommyhawk and I picked it up.  I thought at first that it was a baby rattlesnake.  I did get a good photo and video of the turtle.  
There were a few rocky patches during today’s hike - especially around the Knifes Edge - but nothing to complain much about.  As Tommyhawk put it, everything up north has prepared us for Pennsylvania rocks.  The Salomon X Ultra boots that I bought back in Lincoln, NH at about mile 390 were good for about 400, maybe 450 miles.  For the last 100 miles, the soles provided very little protection from whatever I’m stepping on and the uppers have really fallen apart in the last week.  Water from the wet grass that we walked through along the trail above Palmerton soaked through to my socks in no time because of tears in the upper shoe material and seams.
After the Knife’s Edge, the trail was smooth and flat, and I felt my late afternoon energy surge coming on. We made it to the PA RT 309 by four, and I said goodbye to Tommyhawk who was pressing on to a shelter 4 miles further.  Hopefully, I’ll be able to catch up to him in a few days.  
The Blue Mountain Summit B&B is easily visible from the trailhead at PA RT 309.  Though officially closed, I had spoken to the owner Bruce when I called last weekend, and he accepted my reservation and was expecting me when I arrived.  I left my backpack just inside the front door of the restaurant and watched football for several hours.  Bruce was redoing the men’s room, but checked on me from time to time and refilled my beer glass as I watched the Washington Redskins narrowly defeat the Dallas Cowboys thanks to a missed Dallas field goal with no time left on the clock.  For dinner, I ate a delicious Italian sub from Whole Foods that Bruce’s wife Karen picked up for me.  After the game, I took a nice hot bath - which I haven’t done in ages.  It was well passed hiker midnight, and I was so relaxed that I fell asleep in the tub.  
Today was a very good day.","Stealth Site near Palmerton at 927.7
