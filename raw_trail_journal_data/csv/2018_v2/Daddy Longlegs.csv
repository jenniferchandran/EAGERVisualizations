Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594758,"Howdy Folks!
Welcome to Daddy Longlegs' 2018 Trail Journal. 25 more days to go. (This first post is just to create a prelude page - the real journal is yet to come. I forgot I have to make three entries before we go LIVE!)
Will resume the hike NoBo from the Grafton Turnpike, New Hampshire in July. Kudos to trail Angel Greg Cook for his assistance in bringing this endeavor back 'full circle'.
Come along as i attempt to complete the remaining 424 miles to Katahdin ...OR, if you are feeling particularly adventurous, join me on the AT!
Thanks to all of you for your unwavering support throughout last year's journey (you can see last year’s trailjournal here: http://www.trailjournals.com/journal/entry/550689 ) as well as the rehab efforts. Cannot put into words the excitement level...

Hanging out overlooking the Gulf of Mexico is pretty relaxing. Building sand castles, throwing the frisbee with the kids, swimming in the warm crystalline waters. And, all the while, the little voice keeps reminding me that the MTNS are waiting...calling me back...& you know what that means: Gotta go. 
Couple more weeks and logistics will deliver this old body back to NH. Can the knees hold up?
   Can the spirit??
Conversing with Foghat, I admitted to being more than a little nervous. (Like a ‘long tailed cat in a room full o rockers’ at this point) Having been totally immersed in the ThruHike world, then being torn from it, then watching from afar as friends finished the walk...and now contemplating being dropped back on the spot from which I left...hmmm.
Can’t get back what was left behind. (None of us can) My tramily finished the AT, moved on, and is out doing PCT, CDT, and LIFE these days. The AT that’s calling me is more than a simple mountain. More than the rocks, roots, and soil. It’s the people. The journey. It’s Greg taking the time to help. It’s HodgePodge sending me updates. It’s wondering about The Dude’s whereabouts. It’s Action Jackson & Batman cheering me on thru physical therapy. And this time I’ll be all alone ...Back on the Grafton Turnpike and headed into the The Whites. Yeah, I’m a little nervous.
But that’s the Journey! That’s life. It’s nerve wracking and anxiety inducing. It’s wild and beautiful and unknown. Waiting to be embraced. The mountains are calling and I must go!
So much to do.

And with this entry, the “Daddy Longlegs 2018 Trail Journal” should go live...
First a “Thank You” to all those Service men & women who provide the blanket of freedom we sleep under. You rock! 
Besides grilling out and enjoying a few cold beers this afternoon, today included washing gear and acquiring a few items still needed for the hike. H2O drops, fuel, tick spray, etc. 
The nerves are still taut but can feel myself “dialing it in” as the countdown to The Whites begins. Thoughts/worries of mileage, calories, etc are reeling through the brain and it is oddly comforting. (For these are the spinning thoughts of ‘hiker trash’ and it provides a confident reminder of my prior life on the trail) Though I’ll be working (tax returns) tomorrow morning, come evening I’ll be walking the burbs with the pack on teaching the muscles to expect more work in the days to come.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596710,"Next Monday I’ll be back in New Hampshire. So excited! Time to get this show on the road...
Dropped by REI today to pick up some DEETpaste and weigh the pack. A nice 16lb base weight - Yesss!
This weekend treated all gear with Pemetherin and packed up all my “systems” (sleep, kitchen, food, etc). Making a concerted effort to go light and ease the strain on this body. (It took over 1,500 miles last year to whittle the base weight down under 20 and need to keep it that way.) Biggest change for 2018 is trekking poles (vs the staff carried last year) and am hopeful this will help the knees. I don’t like them but gotta try ’em! 
The weather up north is vacillating between ‘hot as Hades’ and ‘damn cold’ based on all these journals. I’m gambling on generally hot ...so packing no extra clothes (but chilly mtn nights mean I gotta carry the trusty ‘puffy’ coat). Will likely add hat/gloves/etc in Maine come September. 
No song of the day....but did watch the ageless wonder, Roger Federer, this morning and feel inspired to keep chasing the dream and giving it my best shot.

“If you are ever given the opportunity to take something seriously, jump at it. Whether it’s a job, a pastime, a relationship, a thought, a feeling—when that tuning fork in you is struck and hits the right frequency and you are lit up by something, be aware of that and go toward it. If the world conspires to hide those opportunities from you, be relentless in your effort to broaden your worldview and your life experiences.” —Billy Crudup
Mmm, be ‘relentless in your effort’...This NoBo journey toward the summit of Katahdin has been long. One year ago today, I hiked along with El Vago & Shop Teacher through the Green Mtns of Vermont. We talked of the bigger White mountains that lay ahead and the almost relentless spiritual pull we felt to keep trekking. Discussing the logistics (and acquiring phone service on a mountain top as we dried our wet gear in the sun), I called ahead to Hanover, NH to enlist the help of a trail angel, Greg Cook, to reserve a room.  We spoke briefly...he told me he had room and it was good I called ahead. Little did I know how Fate would
Spin 
the 
wheel.
For those who followed my journey last year the rest is “old hat.” (First day out of Hanover my leg would break and the trip would be halted.) If you missed it... well, after  4 1/2 months it took a heckuva crazy turn hiking into those White Mtns. 
Exactly one year later I fly off north to Boston, catch a bus to Hanover, and find myself back at Greg’s (the very definition of trail angel) house. 
Relentless!
The AT tuning fork hasn’t stopped resonating and by the grace of God, and my amazing family, here I am continuing the AT journey. To say I am excited is an understatement. Holy mackarel! Daddy Longlegs is back on the Appalachian Trail...
Tonight eating pizza at Greg’s home with another hiker, an 18 yr old SoBo from Knoxville,TN named August, that goes by the trail name “4mile”. (He’s been out here exactly one month and he’s come 442.7 miles...that is Truckin’!!) Fun talking with this young man about his adventure. Makes one excited for the big peaks looming on the horizon and reminds me of that burning desire to test one’s metal. Ah, relentless.
Tomorrow it all truly comes full circle and I’ll be back where I left off. 
Life is Amazing. Keep Walking!

Song of the Day: 
“Fly like an Eagle” - Steve Miller Band 
As Jenny drove me to the train station in the pre-dawn darkness this came on the radio. Good stuff.
Then, as I put on my head phones for the flight and hit shuffle on the iPod, what should the universe choose (of the 15,000+ songs available) but “Fly like an Eagle”. Call it fate, kismet, whatever... but I was forced to listen intently and, of course, select that album for the first leg of the journey. (How can one deny such universal magic when it is so apropos?) BTW, the next tune on the album, “Wild Mountain Honey”, fit perfectly too.","Atlanta, GA

I think it the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain. I hope I can make it...” -Red {Shawshank Redemption}
Latitudinal changes mean early sunrise. No matter how tired I might be in the coming weeks, I’ll be up early. The diffused glow at 5:20am found me lying in bed unable to focus thoughts. Beyond excited. An hour later, a big blueberry muffin (compliments of Greg), some vitamins, and I was ready to go despite the morning drizzle. 
By 8:45, Greg and I had said goodbyes at the Grafton Turnpike and I was headed up the trail in the rain. Within 200 yds my socks n shoes were wet thru from the overgrown brush. After two tough miles, I stopped under a road sign kiosk to make coffee and get situated. It was fun to be back amidst the Balsam and Douglas firs of the big woods but the rain was tough. 
Thunder and lightning accompanied me as I headed up Smarts Mtn. and I was soaked thru (as if I jumped in a river fully clothed) by 10:30.
The going was slow as the wet granite provided no grip. It took me almost 4 hours to reach the cabin and fire tower on the summit. (A tough climb!) I did not expect to do a scant 6 miles by 1pm but had to stop. Despite dropping temperatures, I stripped and wrung out my clothes and hung them (though it wouldn’t dry them). Met another NoBo hiker there named Epic. (He lives in Seattle and has hiked the PCT) The rain tapered off and so we set off to go down Smarts Mtn. Wet slow going. Body heat helped dry out some of my clothes and, by 3:30, I had reached the ravine at bottom. 
My legs were finished. Epic had already found a campsite by the river and so I decided to stop despite being short of my goal. 
Pitched a tent, cooked dinner and ate. We hung our bear bags just before the sky opened up at 7:00. Shit! More awful weather means these feet will put on wet shoes and socks and carry wet gear tomorrow. 
Now sitting in my tent, no cell service, in a driving rain storm typing this into my notepad. Hopefully this rain stops tonight as I will not be able to go far in this tomorrow. The granite is just too slick to make any time (& these knees are barking at me after one day). 
Funny how long I’ve anticipated being back out here and now the first day has been simply awful. I’ve noticed lots of beauty and and am excited to make headway towards my goal BUT this is the kind of day that just sucks for a hiker. Guess I had to pay a penance at some point and the AT collected right out of the gate.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597550,"Awoke to Chamber of Commerce weather and began to quietly attempt to pack up. It used to be so routine that it happened fast, but today I spent 90 minutes getting situated. It didn’t help that everything was soaking wet (read: messy & heavy). But the crisp morning air, blue sky, and bird songs had me moving inspired.
First up was a climb from the ravine straight up Mt Cube...4 miles of elevation work and worth every step. From the north end, you could see all the way to Mt.Moosilauke as the sky was clear as a bell. Climbing down was tough and I dearly miss my “hiker legs”. 
From the bottom it was simply time to go up again, this time over Ore Hill. No views up here but a very nice privy, “Castellum Exrementi”. Even a throne to perch upon. (And arguably the foulest dungeon imaginable!)
From the other side began the long climb up Mt Mist. Approaching the top I realized I was out of gas. The long day thru forests of big red spruce and white birch, the first krummholz on Cube, past beaver ponds, and through bogs had simply done me in. 
Still many miles from my destination, there has no choice but to push on.
Finally arrived at Hikers Welcome Hostel, a legendary hostel that has been serving the AT for decades. Went in and signed in, grabbed a Sprite from the fridge, and went out back to sit in the shade. My body was revolting and had been fighting nausea got the last 2 miles. Overheated and slightly dehydrated. Thankfully Pac-Man & PaceCar had a couple Pepto’s and my body rejoiced in stopping. 
Thirty minutes later all my gear was drying  on the lawn, my bunk had sheets, and my FedEx package from Jenny was secured. 
A hot shower and some pasta and all was right with the world. 
Of note, who should I run into here but C-Biscuit. Whoa!! We hiked together on & off thru most of Virginia last year before he got off trail with an injury. He came back out a few months ago and has rocked his way all through New England & is planning to finish in the next month or so. Pretty awesome!
Time for bed so I’ll call it quits. (After I go outside and stand where the WiFi works to upload this)

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597658,"This morning, as I was headed up Mt Moosilauke, some rough news came over my phone. The passing of Bobbie McRee. One of the sweetest people I’ve had the good fortune to know, she succumbed to cancer and the world is a poorer place without her in it. My condolences to Duke and the whole family. May she Rest In Peace amongst the angels of Heaven.
Here in New Hampshire, Mother Nature dialed up another stunner as I passed the 1800 mile mark and climbed the first ‘big’ mountain a NoBo faces in The Whites. Climbing a 20 degree slope along a waterfall, the pungent aroma of “Christmas trees” filling the air, with sweat dripping from the end of my nose, the AT grabbed me. ”Stirred my soul” as they say. That drive that had pushed me for over four months last year welled up inside my heart. This was an epic mountain. One I had itched to climb and now it didn’t disappoint. I took two fairly hard falls on the way up. Drawing a little blood on the first one and a nice dirty bruise on the next. (But that’s the price of epic mountains—a little pain) Eventually the trees gave way to the Alpine meadows surrounding the summit. Mountains 60 miles north lay visible. Absolutely stunning in all directions. 
We sat up top in the chilly wind for an hour before heading down. Passed by a work crew from Dartmouth Outing Club on the way and thanked them for all their hard work here in the White Mtns. (Terrific albeit tough trails up here.) Big shout out to Jenny for sending my trekking straps: the tough hike down, and consequential knee pain, was ameliorated by the poles. 
Within a few hours I was back at the hostel, had a shower, picked up tomorrow’s dinner from the hiker box, and recharged my devices. Thankfully it appears the iPod will be working too so our ”song of the day” segment will return tomorrow. 
Before I conclude today’s missive, a quick thanks to Paula for the encouraging email.  Your note helped power me up the mountain today. You rock. (I really appreciate the support from all my family, friends, and readers. Thanks!)
Tomorrow I go for a little bigger miles in hopes of doing Franconia Ridge in the next two days before the weather turns rough. In the meantime, one more good nights sleep in the bunk house here at Hikers Welcome hostel. (Kudos to Bizquick and Brooklyn for their wonderful hospitality)

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597805,"(No service up here at Kinsman Pond so this one will be posted a day late)
Holy Mackerel what a day!
Got up ready to roll. Had coffee and went to pay up with the caretaker at the hostel only to find that my room had been taken care. What?? Giant thanks to Foghat. (Dude, that was too kind. Your karma-meter is now on full! Paid it forward by taking care of the slack-pack bill for Moose and SweetTea.)
Apparently the karma kept rolling as I ended up seeing a Moose within the hour. 
Yes, a big bull moose with velvety summer antlers! After 50 years I finally saw one. 
When my Dad was a kid, his Dad used to read him the Burgess Book of AnImals. In turn, my dad read it to me when I was little every night before bed. Of course, I read it to my kids. This old volume has a big Moose on the cover and it’s glorious. I’ve always wanted to see one...the largest of mammals in our hemisphere. It did not disappoint. 
Perhaps this “anniversary of breaking the leg” wasn’t something to worry about after all!
The hike started by leaving Kinsman Notch and heading up Mt Wolf. At a overlook just 1/2 mile or so from the summit I met a nice SoBo who is hiking in remembrance of lost soldiers. For 22 families,  he carries a picture placard of their child for 100 miles. At this point, he had Sgt. Dave Wolf’s picture with him. How fitting and what an excellent tribute. May Davey Wolf Rest In Peace and kudos to his family for laying such a heavy price on the alter of freedom.
From the summit of Mt Wolf, we dropped three miles down thru the big northern pines to Eliza Brook. The cool water was just what I needed. Had gone thru a few liters in the last 8 miles and was about to tackle another “BIggie”... South Kinsman, another of the 4000 footers. (There are 48 of them and it is quite a feat to hike them all. The AT only scratches the surface) The climb up was arduous. Many times it surpassed simple hiking (as it required hands and feet to get up the steep rocks) and was mountaineering ...without the gear! It took a few hours to do the miles but, up top,  the crystal clear sky afford amazing views in all directions. From there we dropped down and back up another 4K mtn, North Kinsman. Trying to get down was serious hard work. 
Pulled over into the AMC shelter 1/2 mile down from NorthKinsman summit at Kinsman Pond (as I couldn’t go anymore without risking injury). Not as far as I hoped, but more hiking than I ever imagined! The Whites are tough stuff. 
At the shelter I set up my bag, cooked broccoli&cheddar rice with salami, had some hot tea and dipped my legs in the pond. (A beautiful alpine lake ringed in granite, covered in lily pads, and sporting a few loons as the sun sets and the moon rises. definitely worth the walk!) Had a chance to talk to Jenny and catch up. Nice to be able to call even if I can’t get enough coverage to post. 
Now all our food-n-smelly stuff is in the bear box and am ready to hit the sack. My first night in a shelter since being back...
Tomorrow will begin early as I shoot for Franconia Ridge. Bring it on!!

",Kinsman Pond Shelter,"Jul 20, Fri",12.50
Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597859,"Woke up early in the Kinsman Pond shelter and quietly headed down to the shore to make a cup of coffee. Watching the orange & gold sunrise reflect off the water helped keep the 45 degree chill at bay. So peaceful when...Splash! Across the lake something big went in. I looked at the distubance and up stood a moose. A moose! Watched her walk up and out across the marsh. It wasn’t even 6am and this day was already one for the books. I sat mesmerized saying little prayers and relishing the gift of the moment...it’s another of those AT moments I’ll never forget. 
Finally went back to shelter, packed up my sleep system, packed my kitchen system, stripped off the ‘puffy’ jacket, despite the chill, and headed out. (Always dress for mile #2) By 8:00am, hit Lonesome Lake Hut a few miles down the mountain. My first AMC hut! Went in and they had breakfast leftovers so I ate two big plates and then helped Maddie, one of the crew, sweep all the bunk houses. Easy work for a great meal and it was fun talking with a ‘Croo’ member. A full belly and a pack loaded with good water, the trail came easy as I rolled down to Franconia Notch.
It was 11am by the time I headed up towards Mt Liberty(deceivingly tough), gateway to the Franconia Ridge trail. Now let me take a minute to say that Franconia Ridge is one of those iconic places that every AT hiker dreams about. Miles & miles of alpine ridge trail above tree line traversing numerous “biggie” peaks. The last few days have provided stellar weather, and the forecast promised one more, so the effort has been to “roll on Franconia” today. 
Huffed and puffed up God’s Stairmaster to Franconia (yeah, like anything good in life you gotta put in the work to get the reward!) and hit Cannon @ 4200, Little Haystack @ 4800 then on up over Mt Lincoln and Lafayette both over 5000ft up. The weather was perfect and another hiker with “the peak finder” app was able to get ‘peak hits’ 80 miles out. (Ridiculous visibility!)
Felt truly blessed walking along in the fabled White Mtns surrounded by staggering views. Could look south and see what I’ve crossed as well as the big ‘Presidential Range that awaits to the north. Magnificent.
By 4pm I decided to take a steep(!!) 1.1 mile trail down to the Greenleaf Hut and inquired about “work for stay”. In luck, they said, “Are you Daddy Longlegs? We heard about you (Maddie had told ‘em I was coming). Sure, just hang out til after dinner”. So super yummy leftovers (turkey!) and a dry place to sleep were the capper to this amazing day. Given the storms in forecast, I am really thankful to the crew for helping me out. So at lights out, I’ll set up my pad under the dining room table. Best room in the house! 
(Also moving a little ahead of schedule so tomorrow will be a small mileage day in the rain. Will hang out and get breakfast leftovers for a little housekeeping duty first)

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597913,"*can’t upload pics with this coverage*Slept under the dining room table in the Greenleaf Hut last night. The night sky was beautiful and the Milky Way resplendent at this altitude. The wind gained strength through the night and the morning gales were a portent of foul weather a-coming. 
I sat on the [wind blocked] back porch during breakfast as the crew served 48 overnight  guests. (This hut sits near road access and saw over 1,000 visitors yesterday alone) Once finished, the guests started filing out. I helped bus the tables, swept the main dining hall, and then the bunk rooms. Followed by breakfast with the crew: eggs, sausage, oatmeal and blueberry muffins. By 9am, my bag was packed and the time had come to go but the wind was fierce. Could barely stand outside and gusts registering over 60mph forced me to consider alternatives. After discussing the conditions with the Forest Service Emergency Runner, he advised simply ‘staying put’. 
“Prudence is the better part of Valor”
I just hate sitting. Though itching to get back out there ...miles of alpine trail (above tree line) engulfed in rain clouds simply makes no sense. The risk reward ratio just ain’t worth it. So an unplanned Zero Day made this Sunday a true ‘day of rest’. Unfortunately, all tonight’s guests arrived before noon as none want to hike in this mess. So the quiet mid-morning hut  transformed quickly into a boisterous one. 
Ah, the AT. You just never know where you’ll end up or what will happen.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598125,"Woke with the morning light at 5am and knew it was going to be a wet day. The rain had pummeled the dinning room windows of the hut nonstop all night. (Around 1:00am the storm woke me and I went outside to the alcove to retrieve my shoes and socks. They were soaked but I brought the stinky beasts inside anyway. Yes, their utter putrescence requires outdoor storage) 
Repacked the whole pack in an effort to insure the contents would stay dry. Put on my wet socks and shoes. Aarrgh. 
Helped the crew with breakfast for the guests but didn’t plan to stay for my chance at leftovers. Just stayed long enough for the weather report. (Yuck—get moving) They filled my coffee and gave me pancakes for the road. (Really a cool Croo) Bid everyone in the dining room farewell and headed into the clouds. 
It was more than a mile back to the AT and all of it straight up Mt Lafayette. (Journal Note* The mileage total each day doesn’t reflect all the hiking, just the “trail miles”. Water, shelter, view, etc ‘spur trails’ aren’t included) Visibility was poor in the clouds and it was raining. At times very hard. Walked the ridge carefully as ‘wet granite is slippery granite’. On summits the wind was strong, sustained 30-35mph, but down below tree line it stayed 20-25mph. (The huts have anemometers to show the wind speed) Wet n slow day...
Hiked down through the alpine zone then back up over Mt Garfield. The real trick was coming DOWN the north face of Garfield as it was a mountaineering feat. Basically, a boulder waterfall. Using all fours, I made it down with only a few heart palpitations. Having survived that, the next biggie looming was Galehead Mtn. Cruised up to the hut on top, had a bowl of soup, and tried to dry out for a bit. Inquired about work for stay but it was too early in the day and they sent me packin.
(Rats! Had hoped to stay & take on the next “Biggies” tomorrow...oh well)
Headed out and on and over South Twin. It was a haul over this mountain (clips close to 5,000) but my legs felt surprisingly strong. Hooray, the first vestiges of ‘hiker legs’! Unfortunately today called for something more akin to webbed feet...but the trail was quite beautiful from South Twin to Mt Guyot and water logged feet aside I had a great time. 
Was it the hiker legs? The dripping firs? The aromatic pine forest? The relentless deep puddles? It was all awesome. Parts of the trail reminded me of the “river-like” trail in The Smokies last spring. The wet rocks brought memories of the Grayson Highlands flooding back. The Weather was nasty, I looked ridiculous (grey rain skirt, lime green rain jacket, purple hat, yellow/orange swirl gaiters—A woman at the hut this morning said I was making “quite the fashion statement”. Hey, whatever works!), my feet were swimming, and yet ...the AT gave me one of the nicest hiking moments I’ve ever had. Big old grin on my face as I rolled up to the summit of Guyot. Yep, I was the idiot laughing at nothing (maybe everything?) in the rain. Simply wonderful. 
Took a spur trail a mile down to Guyot shelter as it seemed a bad idea to keep marching the soaked feet. Hot spots were forming and it was time to get dry! I was the only person in the shelter so I dumped everything out of the pack, stripped bare and hung everything up. My pack towel had been saved for this moment and it was great. Put on dry undies and my puffy and made dinner. While eating, another couple arrived ...and then a few SoBos. Happy to have gotten in, got set up, eaten and in my bedroll as everyone came in looking bedraggled. Just a little journaling and off to bed.

Hoping sky would clear. Rolled up the mountain about 8:30am after a long morning of chatting with other folks at the shelter. (Hard to get going when you have to put on all wet clothes, socks n shoes at 50 degrees.)
Was in full rain gear after yesterday’s deluge and spitting rain all morning. It didn’t help much and what was damp turned soaked after crossing summits of Guyot and Zealand Mtns. Pulled the bro the Zealand Hut at noon to dry out. Removed shoes, wrung out my socks, and hung up everything but hard to dry things in the rain. Had a scone, some cookies and coffee, while watching the clouds begin to break up above the valley. After an hour I headed out again towards Ethan Pond as the rain had stopped...
Super easy trail and took a spur to Thoreau Falls. Wow- all this rain had that thing roaring!
Rolled up with intention to stay at Ethan Pond but decided to shoot for a few more miles to find food. (The bag is running mighty light!) 
Of course it started raining again as made it to the highway - hitched a few miles to a general store in Crawford Notch and decided to camp at the Saco River campground with Gizmo (another NoBo from Florida.

Well, this was a tough day. 
Actually I need to give a little more info on yesterday to set the stage properly...
Stayed at the campground about 3.5 miles east of the trail in Crawford Notch. Paid their ridiculous prices for some resupply items but happy to be carrying some real food for a few days. Decided to pay their ridiculous camping fee (gizmo and I split it so not too bad) and acquiesced for amenities. Looked forward to shower & cleaning some clothes! First the washer was busted. Then went to take a shower and the semi lukewarm water turned to ice water after first minute. Shit! I was able to rinse some dirt and funk off but still stink. Clothes are still sour smelling too. Went to bed grumpy in the rain...
This morning was up with the sun and packed quick. Went up to the store/office for coffee and biscuit but they don’t open for 2 more hours. Geez—this place was a mistake. Made instant coffee, ate poptarts, and headed to the highway. Walked 3.6 miles along US302 and never caught a ride. (Actually saw less than 10 cars during the hike back to the AT.) So, once again, walked much farther than log will indicate. Tried hard to make the best of the situation but it is tough. 
My frame of mind has been deteriorating with each passing rain shower for the last two days. Having a hard time getting passed it. The feet are now in perilous shape and tomorrow I’ll be climbing Mt Washington in more rotten weather. Egads... 
The climb out of Crawford Notch is tough going up 3000 ft of elevation in first 3 miles. The drizzle began to break up and even a few rays of sunshine appeared as I reached Webster Cliffs. Tried to pull out some wet stuff to dry but the sun was too fleeting. Sat and rested for longer than I meant to and as the clouds enveloped me I restarted up the mountain. Eventually crossing the summit of Mt. Webster, then Mt. Jackson, the climb was slow as the slick rocks treated me to a few stumbles and one hard fall. (Thankfully the pack bore the worst of the landing). I did not reach the Mizpah Hut until mid-afternoon but happy to get up here. Treated myself to coffee (and cake) and warmth before heading to the tenting area just down a side trail. 
Set up on the platform before the real downpour came BUT water didn’t drain on the platform (the gaps are clogged between the boards)...just pooled up under my tent. “Some days you are the windshield and some days you’re the bug”. Dang, sleeping in wet tonight. 
As the storm passed, went out to make dinner and it was yummy. Hot tea, pot of wild rice with salami and Vermont cheddar on top. The rain stayed away as I cooked and the caretaker came by so I had company while eating. We talked for a long time and my spirits were lifted considerably. Got all my pots, food bag and smelly stuff locked in the bear box before the rain returned. More thunderstorms expected tonight but I’m tucked away in the tent and have dry socks on these worn out feet. 
All feels right with the world at the moment.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598469,"Woke up early (with the 4:50am light)
Rained nonstop throughout the night and the tent was a wet mess but had a big day in mind so hustling was in order. My target was the Madison Hut located 12 miles northeast on the other side of some big mountains, including the iconic Mt Washington. 
With a big wet mess strapped to my back, rolled up to the Mizpah Hut up the trail from the tentsite. Had a cup of coffee and was offered work for breakfast but I didn’t want to wait an hour+...the mountains were calling. It was 6:30am so took off up the trail and began to climb Mt Pierce. At over 4300ft this was my wake up call. The rain was merciless for the next three hours as I climbed Mt Eisenhower and Mt Monroe and continued on up over tree line & 5000ft mark to “Lake of the Clouds” Hut at the base of Mt Washington. Really cool place! Enjoyed the baked goods and another cup o joe. The Croo here was very friendly and had great music playing so I sat a little longer than I planned. However, when I walked out to begin the 1.4 mile climb up Mt. Washington, the rain stopped. Still in misty clouds but no heavy drops...Yahoo! 
Spirits lifted, the climb went quickly. Took a summit photo {6288 ft}, 
**journal note: this mtn has the highest recorded wind speed on Earth and is home of our planet’s worst weather. Many have died up here
then went to the touristy gift shop (there is a cog train to the top=loads of tourists) and ate a couple hotdogs, then headed out. Many more miles above tree line left to go and the weather was worsening. 
Yep, the damn rain was back. 
For the next few hours, I would traverse slick boulder fields in a driving rain storm. Up and over Mt Clay and then around the side of Mt Jefferson (thankfully the AT followed the leeward side today), Daddy Longlegs was cursing repeatedly. “Smite me, oh Mighty Smiter!” was even hollered at one point. It was the very definition of miserable.
Eventually at 4:30 I limped into The Madison Hut looking pathetic. Inquired about work for stay and they said, “Sure!”
I almost cried...Tonight I’d be under a dry roof!! Took off my wet shoes n socks and let the feet air out. After two hours they were still pruned but beginning to normalize. Several wicked sores, mostly on the right foot, mean tomorrow will be a small mileage day to Pinkham Notch. (Time to find this gross stinky body a shower and a chance to wash n dry some clothes!)
Best news: at 6:32pm the clouds began breaking up some and revealed patches of blue sky above. 
Mt Madison became visible and it appeared we were floating in the clouds (as most are below us). Everyone in the hut got up from dinner and went out to look. We haven’t seen the sun in many days...
Tonight my “work for stay” job was to do a little talk on my AT thru hike for the 48 paying guests of the Hut. As most of you know, or can guess, I have no problem rambling (though I’m no public speaker). That said, wasn’t really prepared to be tonight’s ‘entertainment’, and just getting up in front of people is a little disconcerting. Especially if you haven’t showered in a week! But the talk went great and folks asked lots of questions. (Guess I should work up a true presentation) The Croo was happy to kick back and let me handle the hour and I think it went well. 
So nice to be on a clean swept floor inside as the wind has picked up and it’s a little chilly. (Hopefully some high pressure to bust up this rain!) 
What a day. Tired but smiling....

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598541,"Woke up in the middle of the night and went outside to gaze at the sky. A billion stars, highlighted by our Milky Way traversing the black sky, was a truly welcome sight. No clouds!
The morning sky was clear with puffy cumulonimbus clouds well off in the distance. Though stunning, unfortunately the forecast says those clouds are rollin’ this way quickly. Cool 20-30 mph morning winds added a note of truth to the WOB (Washington Observatory Bulletin). Cold & Warm Fronts colliding in this vicinity is a dangerous mix...definitely a small mileage day. 
The power failed in the hut in the early morning hours. The Croo still pulled off an amazing Breakfast. (They started making handmade donuts at 5:30. Wow!) Lack of power changed my work duties as no power meant no water/dishes ...so I swept the hut. Laid out all my gear in the sun to dry while we worked and by 9:30 all was dry(ish), packed up, and ready for departure. Said goodbyes to many hikers and the Croo then headed up over summit of Mt. Madison. Great start: 1/2 mile straight up alpine boulder field. Glorious views for first time in a week! Hard going however and it took two hours to do the first 2.4 miles. Once back below tree line things got a little quicker and the last few miles (down the Old Johnson Rd trail) were easy into Pinkham Notch visitor center. 
Pinkham Notch is one of the largest and oldest Huts in the AMC system. From there I called The Libby House & Barn in Gorham to find a place to stay. Paul said he had a spot in the barn and he’d pick me up shortly. Sat watching the deluge of rain that began just minutes after I reached the Hut thankful to be oitof the elements. The big old white Cadillac pulled up to get me and, next thing I knew, we were back at the hostel among a collection of NoBos and SoBos all staying in the Barn. 
A wonderful shower, clothes laundered, dinner eaten and a tall beer consumed. Dang, it feels good to have some creature comforts under a dry roof!
Based on the forecast, my hike is about to take a hiatus. Time to head home for a bit and be with the family! My knees held up surprisingly well and, though the extreme weather took a toll on my feet, feel confident I can come back in a few weeks and hike on through to Mt Katahdin.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598674,"The Barn. This AT hostel is attached to The Libby House (a haunted Victorian B&B) in Gorham NH. Paul runs the hostel and it was quite the welcome respite. Comfy bed (real bed, not a bunk, so my ‘Daddy Long’ legs could hang off) and a quiet sleeping room made for wonderful rest. The Barn, added to The Libby House in 1881, has everything. Great shower, loaner clothes, washer/dryer, charging strips, WiFi, full kitchen , couches, etc. Just what a hiker wants and it’s $22 a night: Solid!
Had a slow morning as the NoBos split after coffee to head into state #14, Maine!
Good luck to Steps, BattleLion & Dirt Devil (the girls from Houston,TX), Oats (nice kid from Cobb Co.GA) and Ghost (funny dude from CharlestonSC). Enjoyed meeting them and wish them safe passage to Katahdin!
My shuttle driver, Bruce aka “Golden Waldo”, arrived at 9:30 to take me to the Berlin Airport in Milan, NH about 15 miles north of the hostel. He finished his AT section hike in 2000 and, though he hails from  Louisiana, he lives up here in the summers (too hot on the bayou) and shuttles hiker every day all over New England. When I asked him what made him want to do this he told me, “I cant hike anymore but I figured out what kind of assholes I like to hang around and this gives me that chance.” Yep, we got along great. (Had so much fun talking we drove 3 miles past the airport before we realized it!) Many thanks and safe travels, ’Golden Waldo’.
The little white Cessna N73409 piloted by my old college roommate, Tommy O’Leary, touched down on the tarmac at 10:56am. I hopped in and was whisked off into the friendly skies in five minutes. Flying around the mountains i’d been hiking was an incredible perspective. So cool! Though the toughness of the terrain is masked at altitude, the formidable nature of the place is readily apparent and grandiose. Seeing the massive cloud banks envelope the mountain ranges affirmed the decision not to hike today (despite the seemingly sunny weather at the hostel this morning).
We landed in Burlington at lunch time, toured the Airline Hangar where Tom’s company is building its secret prototype (cool to have homeland security clearance at the airport to just go thru fences, etc) and, later as we sat eating and reminiscing, was struck by how weirdly odd my Vermont travels have been. Walked there the first time and now been flown in by Tommy!
We went back to The house for pints, conversation, and the Liverpool match. After Liverpool crushed ManU, we went to watch the sunset over Lake Champlain. Simply spectacular. 
Stayed up & talked until 2am...
My feet are so happy with the lazy day and talking all night about how to save the world was almost like being back in our college apartment.

We hung out until the kids all arrived. Fun catching up with them. They have become high quality young adults and we spent the early afternoon chatting and playing board games. 
Later we went for a hike on the RedRocks trail along the high banks of Lake Champlain. Easy path to stretch the legs with cool old trees and interesting rock formations. Felt nice to do some easy walking and the feet are healing up nicely. 
Afterwards we shopped for foodstuffs and then grilled out in the waning light of the day. Dinner was followed by ‘family movie night’ as we all piled on the couch, ate ice cream and chuckled thru “Guardians of the Galaxy #2”. Such a relaxing evening — am so appreciative of the hospitality.

I’m not a big fan of water parks in general but it was a lot of fun. No crowd and everything was very clean. Driving up thru farm and dairy country was quite entertaining as well.

Turned north up Hwy91 thru MA and VT and then east on 93 before dropping down into The White Mountains. What gorgeous country our big north forest is! (with lots of Moose crossing signs to boot)
Passed thru Bretton Woods and by the Mount Washington hotel. Really cool to see the Presidential Range I hiked just a few weeks ago from the valley floor. (Seeing those mountains dissolved the apprehension that’s been nagging and made me SO excited. I’m back! ...And the sun is shining! )
On thru Crawford Notch and then pulled over to pick up hitchhikers at the AT trail head. Buddha and Budapest (SoBo flipfloppers) were headed for Crawford Notch Campground and it was nice to be able to get them a few miles down the road quickly. Always good to put Trail magic in the universe!
Dropped the car in Glen, NH then grabbed a ride to Pinkham Notch visitor center.

The hostel stirred to life about 5:30am. Hikers hobbling about in an attempt to quietly get their gear in order before the shuttles head out...”weird scenes inside the gold mine” ran thru my head in Jim’s voice and had to stifle a laugh. Time to get this show started!
Not technically slack packing but did pull a few pounds of gear out and leave them at Paul’s Barn. Pack weighed out @ 18lbs with food and H2O this morning. Everything helps when tackling the White’s! 
The resumption of this Journey began at Pinkham Notch. The big white Cadillac dropped us off at the visitor center and I headed north. After a half mile around Lost Pond, the trail climbed up out of the Notch on the south side of Wildcat Mountain. The plan was to cross the summits of all the Wildcats, Carter’s Dome, Mt Hight, and South/Mid/North Carter’s along the way to the Imp Shelter. Bagging 8 of the 48 NH 4000 footers on day one was perhaps a bit presumptuous but, as mentioned previously, Excitement ruled the day!
Felt good thru the morning but didn’t arrive at Carter Notch Hut until noon. Frankly, rocking along at only 1.5 mph, the trail was kicking my butt. The sharp climb up the Carters after lunch was no joke and wore me out. Still had to lay down 5 more miles to the Imp Shelter —and going down North Carter to it became more of an exercise in ‘controlled falling’ than hiking. Limped in completely gassed. Thankfully there was room in the shelter as I was too tired to set up a tent. And given the crazy wind I don’t think I could have! (Gusting to 70 mph!! No, I’m not making that up—see the pictures)
After dinner was treated to an amazing sunset and a reminder of just how special the great wide world is. Beautiful.

Cup of coffee was a joy as I watched the valley floor below light up in the morning sun. Sleep did the body good and last nights aching knees felt stronger. 
The AT headed straight up another 4000 footer to start the day. Mt. Moriah got the blood flowing (and set us up for a long steep drop toward the Androscoggin River, and the town of Gorham, below). 
The southward views on Moriah were breathtaking as yesterday’s gale-force winds cleared the skies at low altitude and the Presidential Range sat basking in the summer sun. Rare to see the Mt Washington summit without a halo of clouds. Magnificent!
The descent was taxing but devoid of the dangerous ‘rock slides’ required on Carter yesterday. (I’ve been asked about the elevation in emails so here’s the math: today the trip down Moriah was an easy drop of 1600 feet in a mile. Basically a 30% grade. Steep but not the 40% grade off North Carter yesterday-yikes) After about 3 miles down we hit the 1890.9 mile mark...less than 300 to go!  The trail leveled out there as well. We chatted and strolled along the Androscoggin River for miles all the way to Route 2. What to my wondering eyes should appear at the Route 2 trailhead but...Trail Magic! Cooler full of beer & soda and a big box of various treats...what a way to finish the White Mountains. Thank you dear Magicians!
The guys i hiked with the last two days stopped at the Rattle River Hostel but we exchanged contact info and plotted the coming week with a plan to hike together into southern Maine.  Not necessarily a “tramily”, but fun to have folks to walk with. TreeHugger, Steve the Hiker, Giggles, Bluegrass, FreeBird... are all NoBo (and looking at a similar Katahdin summit time) so it’s good to know some faces I’ll see progressing north. 
The rest of the afternoon was spent leisurely in The Barn. Washed clothes, resupplied food bag, recharged the electronics, drank some beers and laughed with the hiker trash. Another full house tonite here and the joint is chock full-o-characters. AT-riffic.
Song of the Day: Wiser Time by the Black Crows.   Good slow groove kept cadence on descent of Mt. Moriah and the forest felt alive. Ah, the power of music to enhance the moment.

Slept a little late so packed up quick, weighed out at 26 lbs (with 3-4 days of food and water), and jumped into Paul’s fleetwood Cadillac for a ride back to the Route 2 trail head. 
Unfortunately, the old Caddy’s wipers were marking time in a steady rain. Blade, Skywater, and I were dropped off at 7:15am at the headed straight for the trees to get cover from the rain. Donning pack-covers & raincoats, we all sat waiting for the heavy stuff to slow...40 minutes later, a break in the downpour signaled time to roll. Crossed the Androscoggin river, flush with ducks and herons, then began to climb up the first hill. The skies cleared on the walk up and ol’ Mother Nature put on one of my favorite perfumes: ‘damp fetid forest’. (Second only to ‘Sideyard Gardenia’)
A damp forest not only offers a deliciously pungent walk but a quiet one as well. Followed a few turkeys (hens) on the way up and was startled by a grouse. (First grouse I’ve seen since The Smokies... and it sounded like a helicopter taking off!) A damp forest in NH also provides slick rock faces. Took a hard fall about 5 miles into the day and was lucky to only sustain some ugly bruises. One of my trekking poles didn’t fare so well as it bore the brunt and snapped. Damn! Will be awhile before I can replace it and that makes the coming miles all the more difficult. 
Luck remained spotty as I ran into some black-n-white hornets and got stung in the following mile. Swatting & running for 50 yds in pain but a little chewing tobacco from another hiker (Skywater) applied as a poultice helped take the fire out of the welts. 
The rest of the day rolled along relatively uneventful though I did pass the 1,900 mile mark(!) and the views were wonderful. Startled a second Grouse later in the afternoon too. That whirring at takeoff is intense. The mornings rain front offered a cool wind all day and, despite working with only one pole, found myself in the Gentian Pond Shelter by early afternoon. Hot tea, Miso Soup, and hiker Pad Thai (punt butter/ramen) for dinner.Eight of us in the shelter tonight and the conversation has been raucous.

Last nights conversations came back over breakfast and we didn’t stop laughing to hit the trail until 8am. The first couple hours were a climb up Mt. Sucess and then we dropped down to cross the Maine border. YES! It has been a long, long road to reach state #14. We all hung out and ate lunch “on the border” (Maine side of course) before beginning a tough climb over the Goose Eye peaks.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601965,"Woke up for moonrise at 10:30 last night (quite the big orange slice) and caught sunrise too. Humidity is gone and the air is crisp in the big woods, so long pants and sleeves were today’s dress code. Would have been regardless given today’s destination: The Mahoosuc Notch. 
Lying but 1.5 miles downhill from the Full Goose Shelter, “the Notch” is considered the hardest mile on the AT. Typically hikers will spend several hours working thru this mile of granite boulders. The AT runs over, around, and under the jumble of large rocks that filled this small valley when one side of the mountain collapsed therein. This section is unlike anything else encountered in the AT’s 2,189 other miles and, to say I ‘highly anticipated it’, would be an understatement. 
Breaking camp and heading toward the Notch list in thought, I passed a group of college kids hiking north as well. One of them called out, recognizing me, and stopped my tracks. It was Robin, one of the Crew from the Madison Hut, where I did ‘work for stay’ in while hiking the Whites in July. (We took a few moments to catch up and I wish her all the best as she begins college. Chase your dreams!) Funny what a small world it is sometimes.
Treehugger, a retired Army Ranger medic, and I stopped at the head of the Mahoosuc to tighten up our gear before entering the Notch. (Anything simply hooked on won’t likely survive the obstacle course) Was happy to have a second set of eyes along for this section. We scouted our routes and worked together. At times passing packs thru the holes we squeezed through. It was slow going and took us an 90 minutes to complete. It wasn’t “hard” but it was fun and challenging. The next step, climbing up Mahoosuc Arm out of theNotch, was however VERY hard. Yowza, what a climb. We were dripping sweat upon arriving at Speck Pond. Took a lunch break before pushing on up Old Speck Mtn. (Another tough climb in its own right)
There were many day hikers on Old Speck enjoying the clear weather and holiday weekend. Tremendous views were afforded from the fire tower on top, as well as cell service. We called for a shuttle to meet us in Grafton Notch and then rolled down the long ‘accessible side’ of Old Speck doing the last 3.8 miles in about 90 minutes. 
Yes, that pace was a little quicker than our recent work, but we were hurried by news of trail magic below. We arrived in time to catch RatBucket (2012 thru-hiker) and Marisa before they packed up. Had a couple of big cheeseburgers and a cookies. Wow, what a treat!! Big thumbs up to y’all for the holiday treats. Our shuttle hauled us across rural Maine to the small town of Andover, home of the Pine Ellis lodge. We checked in, grabbed bunks, took showers, and did laundry before walking a block into town for AYCE Italian dinner at the Red Hen. There were about 20 hikers gorging themselves when we arrived. Hikers get happy when the buffet is laid out, and icy beers are available, so laughter & trail tales flowed. This continued as we made our way back to the front porch at Pine Ellis in the dark and stayed up well past hiker midnight. 
Tomorrow we’ll slack pack over Baldplate Mtn and return to the lodge.

Hummingbirds buzzed ‘round enjoying breakfast at the porch feeders as the building came to life. The leisurely morning was afforded by a late (9am) shuttle to slack pack. 
We arrived at Grafton Notch trail head at 9:45 and promptly headed upwards. {Note* Up here the various notches are not valleys. They are deep clefts in the mountain ridges and the trail is steep in and out} Sweating hard, we arrived at the top of West Baldplate Mtn and found central Maine spread out in all her glory below. We then traversed the bog (thankfully no fall here, just muddy shoes. Not ready to change my name to Daddy BogLegs quite yet!) between the peaks to climb the bigger Baldplate Mtn next. A few trees low, and all Alpine zone up top, as usual the hard climb in Maine was rewarded with a stellar view.

David, one of the hostel owners, sold me a ski pole ($5) as a replacement for the broken trekking pole. Simply cut away part of the handle and duct taped the old strap from the broken pole to it. Worked well, despite it’s heaviness, and definitely helped. So happy to have two poles, especially for the descents. 
Back at the hostel, Maverick, Blade, Skywater, Bluegrass, the Germans, and Voyager (triple crowner) had arrived. Hikers putting away beers and chortling the late afternoon away. Following ‘happy hour’, Dinner was giant burgers at the Andover General Store. Awesome stuff and fun being amongst a crew of hikertrash again...

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602144,"Happy Labor Day! Trust that your holiday was swell and your Labors fruitful. 
Awoke early and packed. Coffee and delicious homemade blueberry muffins to start the day. Our shuttle dropped us off at 7:15 at South Arm Road and we began the day with a SoBo hike over Moody Mtn. 
Not a ‘big mountain’ but a very memorable one! Wicked steep and lots of rebar to assist with those steep faces. On the other side we hit Sawyer Notch, reloaded our H2O, and made the steep climb up Hall Mtn ...and then further up to summit of Wyman Mtn.
By 10:00am was not only gassed but discouraged. Sat on the Wyman summit going through dark contemplation. Actually my thoughts all morning were about quitting this dang trail. Took about 3 hours to go 4 miles. That is lousy progress! The legs feel like worn out rubber bands and, despite very hard work for a week, there is no sign of “hiker leg stamina”. It’s not just the physical aspect either ...hard to describe the mental drain of a long hike. Focusing all your senses, concentrating on the placement of every step. Getting immersed in it again is taxing.
Likewise missing the family terribly. Tried to call home but signal was sparse. Did connect with Jenny for a few minutes before getting cutoff. Then talked to Jake for a few minutes too. These touches, and their encouragement, were a healing tonic.
Even with heavy legs, the next 6 miles rolled off in under 3 hours ...so took a side trail to the swimming hole we spied on yesterday’s hike. Icy cold but immensely refreshing. (Body AND Mind)
Decided to do another hostel stay so hopped the free shuttle at East B Road to the HumanNature hostel. Very cool GeoDome (built by an ex-marine thruhiker) 8 miles outside of town. Super clean and well thought out. We arrived ten minutes before the thunderstorms blew in and the heavens opened up. Can’t explain just how nice it felt to watch it storm from indoors! A shower, a beer, and hot meal completed the attitude adjustment. 
Day by day, step by step...tomorrow is a new day.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602222,"Well let’s pull the curtin back and reveala little bit of “how the sausage gets made” out here....
It’s 19:00 hours on Tuesday night. Just finished rapidly setting up camp in the waning light of the forest. Hung the bear bag line—Bed set up—Boots off. I’m sitting in my tent (to escape the vicious blood sucking mosquitoes) set up in a little hollow beside a babbling stream near the Bemis Mtn road. No cell service here so this journal entry will have to be posted at some point tomorrow.
Deliberating where to start and how to describe the last 24 hours. First, I’d like to apologize for yesterday’s negativity. One of the goals here is to be as positive as possible. Yeah, it sucks out here a good bit of the time. Sweaty, achey, hungry, stinky, buggy, muddy, bruises, cuts and on and on and on. But if you look at things in the negative light, it doesn’t matter where you are; work, school, etc...Finding “the suck” in life really ain’t that hard. What can be truly difficult is seeing the positive in tough situations. Consequently: the positivity goal.
The trail is grueling physically and that is obvious. Basically there is sweat dripping off my nose in the first half hour everyday and it doesn’t let up for 8 hours. Hence I’ve lost 4 pounds this week and I’m eating like crazy (for example today: ayce pancake breakfast, 3 packs of crackers, 2 full size snickers bars, 1 stingerwaffle, 2 bags of cashews, 1 kind bar, 4 Little Debbie Swiss cake rolls, a hamburger, 2 hotdogs, 1 venison/cheese sausage, chips, a tomato, 2 cream sodas, and 6 liters of h20)
But the physicality is nothing compared to the mental challenge. Concentration is part of it (eluded to that previously) however, the real test is mastering your thoughts. Yesterday, could NOT master my thoughts. No matter how hard I tried. When coupled with pesky emotions, the darkness grasped those thoughts and I simply couldn’t shake it. Could not center myself “in the moment”. Negativity got the upper hand with every turn. I just wanted to quit.
And then y’all showed up. Yes, you. The people in my life. My family, my friends, and even the journal readers I’ve never met, that sent words of support & encouragement. And more. 
In the last 24 hours things turned around immensely in this hike. It wasn’t just Chance or happenstance. My wife was unequivocal: we got your back. Keep walking! Managed to beat out the rain last night. Ate a good meal. Got texts and emails all night. Keep walking! Slept great in a comfy bed. In the morning found a new trekking pole. Pep talk from Dad. Keep Walking! Got a rendezvous with old tramily planned out later this week. Keep walking! Shoot, even got a full trail magic dinner tonight at a dirt road in Maine from a man that called out my name when I stepped from the woods ...though we’d never met before. Such is the support of community. 
You did this. Yes, you. 
The miles seemed to slide by today. Sure, it was muddy after last nights storms. Sure, the first drop of sweat rolled off my nose at the 17 minute mark of the hike. Sure, even fell a few times today. But the miles just rolled by. Met new friends. Saw the splendor of Maine laid out like a carpet. Did 12+ miles and then sat in a lounge chair while Snowman & Teddie worked their trail angel magic on us. Even saw Gandalf smoking that giant pipe (but he didn’t do any smoke ring tricks).
Thank you for being here. For being the positivity in my life. Would not be able to chase the dream without you. 
There are technical terms in thru-hiking for a supported or unsupported hike. Technically speaking, what I’m doing is “unsupported”. Hogwash. Utter Hogwash! Without my wife and kids, parents, siblings, friends...well, I wouldn’t be here. Wouldn’t be sitting in a tiny tent in this dark hollow by the stream in Maine, covered in mud, stinking of sweat, with a big ol smile on my face.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602335,"Woke Up (still grinning) in the dark at 5:30am, packed, breakfast done, and crossing the river as the sun rose at 6:30. We made the ‘Height of the Land’ just after 7:00am and kept rocking. No major mountains today (hiked over Old Blue yesterday) but felt a push to make headway today as a 2017 thru hiker, the amazing ‘El Vago’, was meeting us at Route 4 at 3:00pm. 
Had 7 miles under the belt by 10 am and just kept cruising thru the muddy bogs and roots. Stopped for lunch (and Cake... Happy Bday, Cotton!) at Long Pond and though we slowed, ultimately found ourselves at Route 4 at 2:15. (Easiest trail thus far still put a workout on the knees ...but it was a good day) 
By the way, what should we find at Route 4?... Trail Magic!
Zoom Zoom, a 2017 thru-hiker, had cold drinks, chips, ice cream and some resupply items. Since we were early, seven of us relaxed in the shade and rejoiced in these simple pleasures. Thank you so much ZoomZoom! (Hope to see you up in Stratton in a few days)
My man El Vago (frequent trail journal readers will remember him from last year. His 2017 journal is a great read too!) rolled up in his truck. He looks like a civilian without the hiker beard (and a few more pounds on) since I last saw him but seeing that face instantly put a big grin on mine. 
We loaded up and drove to the Hiker Hut where I picked up a resupply box (thanks honey!) and then off to the grocery store. After shopping, we took a couple of the hikers back to the trailhead (their dog was waiting), picked up the Germans, and headed to El Vago’s lake house. 
Cleaned up, went out and ate amazing food in Rangeley. We came ‘home’ and talked ‘til well after hiker midnight. We probably could’ve kept reminiscing all night... but El Vago recognized my yawns as time to shut it down.
Fell asleep ensconced in soft cotton listening to the call of loons on the Lake. 
 What a great day! The AT community rose up and made things awesome once again.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602402,"Woke early to get packed up and enjoy morning at the lake. El Vago had the dog walked, coffee brewed, and was cooking eggs & sausage when I got upstairs at 6:10am. The plan was to eat, roll into town for additional resupply, drop off The Germans (Buttercup & Dread Pirate Roberts) at a hostel, and be back on the trail headed up Saddleback Mtn about 9:00.
Reality was yummy breakfast and then hard rain beginning at 7 am. We decided to delay departure...(no one wants to ride in a pickup truck bed in the pouring rain. No one.)
Still raining at 8. 
Still raining at 9.
Then, given El Vago’s graciousness, we decided to call it a day and take the fabled Zero here at his place. Didn’t have a “Zero” planned in the schedule but the knees applauded the decision. The 0.25” of rain, and potentially subsequent very late start, made it a no-brainer despite a nice afternoon forecast. 
By 10am, of course, the sun began breaking thru and the day became beautiful. At noon, we took the truck into town for resupply shopping. By 2:00 we were enjoying beers and chairs with backs lakeside. (Chairs with backs are an amazing invention and quite the hiker luxury. Much better than sitting on a log, stump, or ground) Hard to believe my only thought a few days ago was “throwing in the towel”. The journey has really turned around. Hence the reason they say, “Never quit on a bad day”.
In the evening, we trucked on into Rangeley for dinner at The Red Onion. (Unlike my food bag, Ramen ain’t on the menu) We chowed down on everything from Pizza to liver-n-onions. Satiated, we came home and readied ourselves for the trail tomorrow. What a fabulous day!
No song-o-the-day since it was a Zero Day. Instead here’s a thought:
No woman has ever shot a man while he was washing the dishes.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602496,"Everyone got up early and was eager to hit the trail. Yesterday’s rain was pushed out by cooler air and it was 44 degrees when I stepped out to throw the pack in the truck. But first, we started with a giant breakfast for 5... Two dozen eggs scrambled, one package of bacon, toast, grapes, blueberries, apples, OJ and coffee. Absolutely stuffed ourselves!
El Vago shuttled is back through Rangeley to the AT trailhead. We said goodbyes, snapped photos, and packed away gloves and jackets (dress for mile two) before crossing the highway and beginning the 5.7 mile climb up Saddleback Mtn. in the crisp morning air. 
The trail was work, and a little muddy, but found myself on the summit in a couple of hours. The view in all directions rivaled any on the whole trip. Visibility was enhanced by the cool air and absence of humidity. The PeakFinder app noted  Mt Washington visible to the south and I was stunned (as that is 200 trail miles behind) to still have the massive peak in sight. Actually; Adams, Carter Dome, Goose Eye, Baldplate, were all visible. Cool to see our path. Enjoyed a grapefruit and hard boiled egg before rolling down Saddleback ridge toward the next big peak, The Horn. From here my views North were better and, upon checking the PeakFinder, my heart skipped a beat. The ghostly form way off in the distance, beyond the looming Sugarloaf Mtn, registered as Baxter Peak. What?!?
Now that is 95 miles north (as the crow flies) so I was skeptical ...but...I sat for a few minutes just awestruck. There was Mt. Katahdin. (No one sees it this soon)  I left Springer Mtn, GA on March 12th, 2017. At lunchtime today, 541 days later, there it was. Trembling, I started back down the trail toward Saddleback Junior. (From its summit, Katahdin again registered in PeakFinder.) 
The next few hours were a blur of roots, rocks, mud, and moss. Despite arthritic flaring in ankles and knees, progress was inevitable today. The thought of Katahdin held sway and pulled my body inexorably north. 
Eventually crossing the Orbeton stream and climbing the ravine up past her steep falls, my body cried stop. We set up a stealth camp on an old logging road 2 miles up Lone Mountain. Had macaroni noodles, broccoli, salami, & cheese in a pot. Two cups, rather than the usual single, of red zinger tea in celebration of a good mile day. With some work tomorrow hope to push all the way to Stratton. Several big mountains lie between... but what else is new?!
Snugged in my bag&tent, anticipating sleep will come easy (despite a cold night) given today’s hard charge. No service here so will post this tomorrow.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602550,"Boy, it was tough getting going today. First waking up was of no interest to me at 5:30am. Chilly morning outside the bag (low 40s) and so I laid around eyes closed until 6:15... then rushed to pack up and hit the trail by 7:00. Felt discombobulated throughout the morning walk. First up Lone Mtn then around Mt Abrams and over Spaulding Mountain. Kept taking breaks in the sunshine to warm up as the breeze at elevation was like an icy knife. 
Hiked around Sugarloaf (Maine’s largest ski area) and then endured a tough descent to the river. laid on the rocks in the sun for too long and had to take on the Crocker Mountains with a deadline looming. Both peaks are over 4,000 ft and not an easy climb ...but the views were spectacular and Katahdin was clearly visible today. (Other hikers all talking about it at the hostel this evening). Sat on summit of South Crocker, enjoying second lunch, staring at the Bigelow Range across the valley. Nice to “scout them” from this vantage point on a clear day. (Very impressive peaks and will be crossing them tomorrow.)
The rest of the afternoon I moved slow as the legs were a bit heavy but it was an enjoyable hike. Crossed the 2,000 mile mark during the last descent which seems a little hard to believe. In the words of Jeremiah Johnson, “Feels far”.
Arrived at the Route 27 trailhead to find a church hiker feed finishing up. Gobbled down a few cheese burgers, cookies, pasta salad and hard boiled eggs before El Vago and his wife Diane arrived at 5pm. They took me to the Hostel of Maine in Stratton (forecast is below freezing temps tonight so I’m going to enjoy a warm bed!) and had brought a big resupply box. Got checked in and cleaned up then we all walked to dinner at a wonderful little Italian restaurant just down the street. (Pasta is good and I could tell my body is needing fuel given the recent mileage.) After dinner we said our goodbyes and I so look forward to seeing them again soon. 
As mentioned before, the support of friends makes all the difference in a journey like this. Am ahead of schedule because of their kindness — also has too much fun and finding myself typing this up past “hiker midnight” so cutting it short here. 
Song of the Day: this is pretty much the AT theme song but it hit me as I was rolling thru the forest on Sugarloaf and found myself singing at top of my lungs.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602725,"Woke in a cozy bunk and knew I had all morning to get going. Treehugger was slackpacking the Bigelow Range and heading for the trail at 7:30 but I decided to return to the trail (normal fashion) at 9:30. Drank several mugs of Carabassett Valley coffee and ate a couple of breakfasts. Went through my resupply box and gave Gandalf a week of coffee, emergen-C powders, some stinger waffles and tea. Left a few dinners in the hiker box too. Despite these efforts, I’m rolling with a giant bag with 4-5 days of food. (No need to resupply until Monson and the 100 Mile wilderness.)
By the time I finished saying goodbyes at the trail head it was almost 10am as I headed towards the Bigelows. The trail was easy for a few miles and provided a good warm up before the first ascent up to The Horns. Despite climbing for a few miles the trail was a dreamscape. Emerald green moss draped everywhere, the roots and rocks defining the pine needle path, dark black mud dried just enough to yield footprints without swallowing the boots. THIS is the path one imagines runs through the big mountains in the great northern forest. Like some elvish glen In a Tolkien novel. Nonstop grinning as I huffed and puffed to the first summit. The world stretched out 100 miles in every direction. The massive spires of Bigelow West and Avery Peak loomed above and even the rocky walls of Little Bigelow Mtn several miles away beckoned me to traverse the Range. 
My plan called for a 10 mile today over the highest summits and then camping in Safford Notch below Little Bigelow. But the trail was so inviting, and the views so spectacular, that I decided to keep walking. Though I started late, and sat for too long on the peaks (staring off at Mt Katahdin laying visible 85 miles north), I targeted the backside of Little Bigelow as my stopping point. The last hours of the day found my weary legs working hard to reach camp. Finally stopped at 6:30 and hurriedly set up as Old Growth cooked his dinner by the fire pit. By headlamp; Cooked, cleaned, hung smelly stuff, and was in bed typing this in the dark woods by 8:00pm. (Consequently this is getting cut here...)
Going for a long hike tomorrow that will take me close to the Kennebec River. The ferry has to take you across so I may have to wait another day for that. More on that tomorrow...

Woke up at 1:15am and realized only a couple more hours wouldn’t be enough. Those Bigelows wore me out! Turned off the alarm and didn’t emerge from the sleeping bag until 7:15am...ah well, HYOH
Spent the morning leisurely packing up and readying for the day. Muscles were a little sore from yesterday’s traverse so no rush. The miles would come...
Hung out and had breakfast, and even a second cup of joe, chatting with Bluegrass. Rolled out at 8:30...& quickly took first break at 9:15 by Flagstaff Lake. So very peaceful- wish my pictures could capture it (but will carry it in my memory forever). 
Did a mile walking with Old Growth (he blogs on the trek.com) before stretching my pace a little then walked with a youngster, Gusher, for a bit before his fast pace wore me down. At 1:00, pulled on the sandy beach along the shore of East Carry Pond (part of Benedict Arnold’s portage in the 1775 attack on Quebec. The AT follows this exact route for many miles to the Kennebec River). Relaxed awhile as I already had 11.5 miles under the belt today. Slightly overcast, a scrim of clouds not only blunted the warming sun but foretold of bad weather on the horizon. Not looking forward to the rains coming so this big mile day was needed.
And what a day to do big miles... 
For the first time in Maine, the elevation change was muted and it was as if Old Mother Nature herself decided to walk along beside me. The wind rushed through the pines playing its tune all day and even tossed some yellow and red leaves to the forest floor, compliments of the latest cold snap. It was one of those magic days when the enchantment of the forest is palpable. Unfortunately it seems most humans feel as though the natural world is something to fight or tame. (We work hard to control everything from the level of dirt to the air temperature.) Once read that this stems from a view of ourselves as being “born into this world”. Like invaders. We are at odds with it rather than realizing that we are born out of it. Like leaves from a tree. And today, as I walked amongst the giant hemlocks through the great north woods, my place in it felt secure and right. The long grasses moving with the current in the bog, the branches swaying in the breeze, the water dancing down the gravel shallows...and my walking... were all in harmony. So the miles rolled by. 
At 4:00 I had done 18 miles and took a blue blaze trail off the AT proper to Harrison’s camp at Pierce Pond Stream. A hunting and fishing camp by trade, this rustic spot also treats hikers warmly. Inquired with Tim (the owner) about getting a bed and thankfully got his last cabin. Worth every cent of the $28 (cash only). Hot shower, roof over my head, and a big breakfast promised at 7am tomorrow (this is legendary on the AT. Folks call ahead from the lean-to up the trail to get some. 12 pancakes, 3 eggs and sausages, juice and coffee). By 4:30, had boots off and hot tea on the porch. By 5:15, was fresh n clean. By 6:30, was full from dinner. Then a quick wood stove burn to heat the log cabin (love a wood stove in the room) and off to bed. 
Typing up the journal this evening but still unable to post as there is no cell service out here. Tomorrow, despite a 1” of rain forecast, plan to hike down and ferry across the Kennebec River. Should have cell service in Caratunk (village on other side) and will post the last couple days.

Happy to be in a dry old cabin with a wood burning stove. (Wait...My last two entries have been “oh so happy”...let me shift gears a minute and tell ALL about the trail life. The first thing I had to do at 6am was put on my raincoat and trudge up to the bathhouse. Night before last, I got to camp late, cooked up an ancient price chopper Alfredo pasta dinner that tasted lousy, and went to bed. Late last night that pasta finished working over my innards and boy was I happy to have access to a flushing commode. Over the next 4 hours I would visit several times. It ain’t all beautiful vistas and enchanted forests out here. Sometimes it’s a load of crap.)
Anyway, after finding early relief and feelin’ empty, I headed back through the rain to the main lodge. Hot fresh coffee - Yum! Then an enormous breakfast: 3 eggs (over medium), 4 sausage links, and TWELVE pancakes (with apples, blueberries & raspberries in them). One of the best breakfasts I’ve EVER eaten. {will post a picture} With the rain coming down, was in no rush to get moving. Sat talking the Tim, Dick, and Kathy for hours. At 10:30am, with the rain slackening, decided to go pack up the gear and head north. Crossed the stream and rolled a few miles before running into the aptly named “Late Start”. We chatted as we walked to the Kennebec River and saw Greg the ferry man coming across in his canoe. His ‘Old Town’ has a white blaze painted on it as this is the official ATC crossing method (two more deaths already this year from foolish folks that tried to ford it). We put on our life jackets and I had the “pleasure boating seat” in the middle whilst the other two paddled. Very cool. (Even cooler: Greg’s book, sitting under his tarp, was the same book I’m reading about this area: Kenneth Roberts “Arundel”. Thanks again for the recommendation,Tom.)
We left the banks of the Kennebec and walked into Caratunk. A small town (population 76) but home of the terrific hiker staple, the Caratunk House. Stopped in, shook off the rain, and ordered the pulled pork sandwich and an awesome strawberry milk shake. (Also picked up a half pound of sharp cheddar and some chocolate) Hung out there at the Caratunk B&B for two hours talking with Gusher (he was taking a zero and heading over to the Kennebec to trout fish), Late Start, Bluegrass, Crunchy, Breezy and a couple flip floppers. Everyone was enjoying the dry, friendly confines. At 2:35, I finished using the WiFi (uploading last two days journal and lots of texts), bid farewells, and start walking down the road. My destination lay 5.7 miles uphill and wanted to make camp before dark. 
The damp trail is one of my favorites and though overcast, the rain had stopped. Walked in shirt sleeves along a small stream for miles. Delightful. Made good time and found a tent spot just up the hill from Pleasant Pond. Made camp, ate good food, and climbed into the tent as darkness fell at 7:30. The loons are calling as I type this and I’m ready to sleep. Two mountains are on tomorrow’s walk, they stand like bookends starting and finishing the trek. Will need strength to get within striking distance of Monson (gateway to the ‘100 Mile Wilderness’) lying 30 miles ahead.

Only put in one ear plug as the call of the loons, owl hoots, and even the bellows of a moose were like a wacky symphony. Sometimes all the noise and critters can mess with me but last night it was ok. (Did wake up and throw in the other ear plug about midnight)
Got up and started morning routine at 6. Down the trail by 7... first climb wasn’t too bad however coming down the other side was tough. The damp forest I relish had become another beast all together with a little more drizzle. It was more like “Satan’s slip-n-slide” disguised as the AT. Fell three times. These shoes have had their tread worn down by NewHampshire & Maine and could find no purchase on the wet slate. Slowed my pace to insure safety and headed to Moxie Mountain. 
This climb was was easier and the last mile to the summit was sublime. Went thru TheCaves and then up onto the granite approach. A flock of blackbirds came over the bald and the rush of wind they delivered was startling. From the summit, Maine did what she does and provided stellar long range views. Even the path along the ledges down offered postcard-esque scenery. A scant 1.8 miles later, the shore of Bald Mtn Pond beckoned so the tent came out and the hiking portion of the day ended at 3:15. 
More hikers stopped and soon half dozen tents were scattered amongst the pines. The clouds blew out and blue skies held sway from 4:30 on. Cooking and laughing, watching the frogs and loons, and then all silently soaking in the beautiful sunset from the rocky shore. One mighty fine evening. By 7:30 the darkness seemingly sent each to his nylon domain in turn.
A strange feeling ebbs thru the hiking community now...as the idea of being less than 10 days from completion settles into the hearts and minds. Several people remarked on it today but none described if they were happy or sad in the realization,  just awed at the impending finish line. Tomorrow we all make for Monson. That’s storied ground for a NoBo. Only 18 miles north...the Gateway to the 100 Mile Wilderness. Plan to stop and stay at Shaw’s Hostel.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602861,"just a quick entry and will elaborate later...
Got up and started rolling. One of the easiest stretches of trail lay before me and, though a couple river fordings were called for, managed “12 x 12” today for the first time since last year (12 miles by 12:00). Had to remove shoes and roll up pants to cross the icy Piscaqaquis River at 9:30am and again after lunch. Not too bad and most of the day the trail followed the river. Felt like I was on the movie set “A river runs through it”. The last few miles wore me down but managed to hit Maine Rt 15 about 2:45. 
The man who runs Shaw’s hiker hostel came driving by the highway and picked me up. A pretty funny and fortuitous happenstance as I was going to call them.  Hodge Podge told me I’d like meeting Poet and he was right - a good guy with a cool place (& he handed me a Pabst for the tour). Now I’m moved in upstairs, had a shower, sporting loaner clothes, charging my electronics, getting ready to do laundry, and then hitting town for chow.  
 More later...Just a few bits to add:-The hot water here is HOT. Straight off the furnace and everyone gets a hot shower. That is a good thing in a large hostel.-the loaner clothes at hostels are hilarious.

We sat at the bar and had a few cocktails, ate well, and enjoyed “open mic night” hosted by the local acoustic band, HalfWayHome. (They bought me a Guinness too) A Swedish gentleman got up and Performed magic. A thru hiker, Gusher, got up and song an Italian opera song. Absolutely awesome. Hung out with him the last few days and had no idea he had that talent. The people are you meet and experience are the true wealth of the AT experience.  {on that note, DaddyLonglegs almost ended up in a bar fight last night. Kind wacky situation: Basically a loud, foulmouthed, old local kept saying disrespectful things and I finally decided to be the guy that shut him up.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602936,"Slept well and really appreciated a comfy bed. Went downstairs and Poet was cooking up a massive breakfast. Coffee was already there so I grabbed a cup and relaxed. (Zero Days Rule!) Soon three eggs over medium, bacon, home fries and AYCE blueberry pancakes materialized in front of me. We all inhaled the feast with gusto.
      {**interjection- have received a few notes about last nights adventure. Those of you who know me, know that I’m not a bar fighter. Far from it. And the last thing I’m going to do is “go off half-cocked” and not finish this journey because of some moron in a backwoods bar. But right is right and sometimes you have to do the right thing. I did and it worked out. And, on the plus side, now I have decided to become a karaoke bar bouncer when I return home. Ha!}
 Zero Day in Monson allows for recharge and planning. The next section is known as the ‘100 Mile Wilderness’. The most remote section of the trail with no resupply. At the end of this section lies Abol Bridge...and the base of Mt Katahdin (whose summit marks the Northern Terminus if the Appalachian Trail). Basically this is the homestretch and we all sit a week away from the finish line. Hard to believe...
Had a yummy lunch at the general store and picked up a LOT of food for the foodbag. Hoped the full stomach would mitigate my food purchasing but alas, it’s gonna be heavy pack tomorrow morning. No way around it. (Pic of resupply posted)
Clothes cleaned. 
Water filter cleaned. 
New gas canister. 
Maps analyzed and course plotted.
Will eat good tonight and enjoy the anticipation with all the hikers gathered here at Shaw’s. 
Few notes: 

the next week will have very little cell service and the phone charge is too valuable to burn searching. Will run ‘airplane mode’ so apologize now for the lack of entries. Should I get coverage on a few of the early Mtns, will update accordingly. 
Many thanks for all the well wishes and support. Family and friends have been a giant part of my “hiking fuel” when the going gets tough (& counter to the often rosy entries, suckiness is a daily occurrence in some form or fashion)
Special thanks to the love of my life and our amazing kids. You guys are my rock and I love you more than words can express. WAMHASxoxo

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603032,"Well this section of Maine is beautiful and it wore my feet out on the first day. Planned to go to the shelter located 15 miles in but, came to Long Pond Stream at the 14.3 mile mark, and pulled up at a stealth site on the north bank. The site was too good ...and who doesn’t love hearing the water tumbling over the rocks as they go to sleep? It was only 4:15 but my body told me to call it a day. 
The 100 mile wilderness is the most remote section of the entire AT and am rolling heavy as I have to carry more food than is typical. Didn’t see any ‘big’ wildlife today on the walk but did see lots of frogs, snakes, red squirrels, and a beaver. It is unusually warm (83) for this time of year and I think the amphibians and reptiles were digging it. (Forecast shows rain in two days and a return to cool afterwards with highs in the 50’s but, for the moment, relishing a lil’ Indian Summer.) The only drawback on my hiking was some chemical burn on my neck from the leftover detergent in my clothes. Washed it out at the creek so should be good tomorrow. (Apparently the last laundry stop wasn’t good. Treehugger got bad burns from it...nothing to do but rinse out in the stream...dang it—c’est la vie)
Good dinner and conversation as 5 others pulled over and made camp here as well. By 7:15 was in the tent reading And by 8pm sleep over took me.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603127,"Woke early and got on the trail by 7. The first climb was a doozie ...up over The Ledges and to the summit of Barren Mountain, the first of five peaks we would climb in the Chairback Range. The view was stellar and the sun was working to dispel the morning cloud cover. From their the AT followed a number of PUDs (pointless ups and downs) to the summit of Fourth Mtn and again the same over the Third Chairback. Was moving good and feeling light the first 6 or so miles until
on the way down the backside of Fourth, my Achilles got strained (not snapped but very painful) and I spent the rest of the day moving quite slow. Damn slow. 
Kept the iPod headphones on all day and kept focused on insuring every footstep wouldn’t be injurious. Treehugger, Breezy, GeardO, Alpine and Ace all passed me as I limped along thru more PUDs, over Columbus Mountain, and down thru the rockslide toward the ponds. Did cross over the 2,100 mile mark today and that put a little pep in my step. Hard to believe the terminus is so close!
At 4pm ran into Treehugger at a crossroads and told him I was done. He was too so we dropped a 1/4 mile down off trail to the shore of the lake and set up a stealth camp. Nice spot and by sundown we were settled into our tents.
With rain coming tomorrow we plan to start early but not sure how big a day it will be. My ankle is aching and the trail still has a tough elevation profile for the next 25 miles. Need to cover about 15 of those to stay on target given supplies I’m currently carrying. The forest is beautiful but the terrain demanding.

Bad Fun- The Cult (Gave me enough pep to make the afternoon privy just in time)

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603145,"There was a ‘ghost of a moon in the afternoon’ when we arrived at camp yesterday. When I turned off my book to go to sleep, our camp was illuminated in it’s brightness. When ‘nature called’ at 2 AM the moon had gone down and been replaced by a brilliant Milky Way. My ankle was really stiff at 2am but when I woke in the morning felt pretty good.
We broke camp early and enjoyed the sunrise over East Chairback Pond. Even the loons came to say goodbye before we headed down the trail.  
Our ascent brought us to the Gulf Hagas trailhead and Pleasant stream. We would have to ford about 150 ft of river but first made a side trip up to the parking lot to hit the privy. Ran into Fluffernut and AT Gracie while there and got morning trail magic in the 100 Mile Wilderness! Chocolates, protein drinks, etc. (They had been camped by the river the last night but a nuisance bear made them sleep in the car!) Thanks again!
We forded the river and went up thru The Hermitage, an old growth stand of enormous White Pines. From there the trail followed a big stream up into the Gulf Hagas Portion of the wilderness. (Both the Hagas and Hermitage are national landmarks and hence the road in for day hikers. No camping or fires permitted here)
The climb up Gulf Hagas Mt was hard but only the first of four successive peaks that culminated at White Cap Mtn. I’m currently sitting on White Cap Mtn typing this to post so you are getting a quick midday synopsis (...as this Is the last “BIG”Peak in the 100 Mile Wood and last shot at cell service). From here I have an amazing view of Mount Katahdin lying to the North. It’s hard to describe the wellspring of emotions I’ve had today climbing White Cap and seeing Katahdin. This “impossible journey” is finally seeming possible. 
The rain is coming so I gotta wrap this. Still have miles to go to the lean-to so I can ride out tonight’s storm
Life is Amazing. Pure and utter Awesome. Don’t take a single Breath for granted. Hug your loved ones and chase your dreams!!! Keep walking.
Addendum:
I hauled it off the top of White Cap as a big storm was coming right at us on the prevailing breeze. The mountain must have pushed it aside as it never caught me. 1.4 miles down I came to the lean-to and still had service so checked the weather app. Rain chances at only 20% and dropping to 5% by 6 pm. 
Would much rather tent than shelter so I grabbed a stealth site about 200 yds past the shelter. Threw up the tent, went and got water and then, on the way back the sky opened up. Raced for my tent and ducked in just as Noah passed me in a big boat. Dammit. I hadn’t staked out the sides or anything. In 10 minutes my tent was filthy from mud splashing up, five minutes later water was pouring in under the tent floor as it came down the sides onto the drop cloth. Frickin rookie mistake and here I sit, 35 minutes later in a completely wetted our tent. Dammit! This night of sleeping in shit, and carrying dirty wet crap tomorrow, is gonna be very long.
When the rain stopped I went out and my coffee cup had just shy of an inch of water in it... what a Gusher! Made dinner and cocoa. (Btw, rookie mistake #2, don’t make cocoa in the pot you just cleaned out with the sock you’ve been wearing for three straight days. It gives the cocoa a perplexing aftertaste.) can’t wait to get in the wet tent and go to sleep!","East Chairback Pond

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603220,"Little things...woke up and the sky was pink. Not just a few little pink clouds at sunrise but a light red sky. There was a guy that I used to work with that always said, “Red skies at night, sailors delight...red sky at morning, sailors take warning.” 25 yrs later, his voice was in my head this morning. Laying here tonight with a cold wind blowing rain against the tent, his words certainly rang true again.
Funny the little things we associate with people in our lives. Funny the little things we remember. 
Walking this trail has been an interesting journey. Obviously the physicality of the journey is not to be taken lightly. And it’s mentally grinding. But frequently it’s mentally freeing as well. Walking all day without distractions of the modern world. A chance to kick thoughts and ideas around for hours at a time unencumbered. Little things pop in your mind, like watching a copse of trees on a windy morning. And because you are just walking to the next white blaze (& the next, & the next, & the next) you can dwell on what you see. The way the birch trees flex and bend while the spruce hold a little more steady. That is until the rush of the wind in their tops reaches a certain pitch and then those spruce heave just so. And your thoughts meander to little things like say ‘invisibility’ (given the winds traits on your mind). Then God, Science, and all manner of past rumination flex in your mind, much like the birch did in the wind, and the little topic of a simple noted breeze has kept you riveted for an hour. Just keep walking...
This journey has afforded countless opportunities to think thorough and drink deeply from the well of life. All the little things.
The picture of the leaf that was posted earlier. I sat and drank a cup of tea and puzzled over that leaf. Then I made another cup and dwelt longer. (Almost didn’t take that picture. Liked it once taken, but almost didn’t share it. Wanted to “keep it just for me”.) Little things can give us such immense joy. Yeah, it’s just a leaf. (Millions n millions of em out here. All different colors and as alike as snowflakes. Whatever) But that leaf spoke volumes to me about the second leg of this journey. Pondering over it, my mind danced and went all those places it’ll go when let loose. Remembering people along the way. People back home. The smell of the forest. The analogies I found for the oddity, the color change, the chance that it sat right outside my forest door. Little things along the way have been a magic elixir for self examination. As I head toward the “finish line”, it becomes more apparent it never was about the destination, but the journey itself. All the little things along the way. 
The AT. An amazing walk up through the oldest mountains on Earth. Today we hiked one of the last named peaks before Katahdin, then ran into trail magic (in the most remote part of the AT!) then rolled out a fast 7 miles, Then ran into trail magic again (in the 100 mile wilderness? Twice in one day??) then wound up camped on the western shore of Jo-Mary Lake as a cold storm blew in to herald the coming equinox. Great conversations today, cold beers, yummy taco bar, all the candy bars I could carry, q-tips, a covey of grouse, more frogs than you can imagine, and new friends.

Took too long getting out of bed, but the Cocoa was warming and eventually the wet tent was packed away and the trail fell away beneath these worn out trail runners. Elevation profile didn’t look bad but roots-n-rocks put the feet through the hell on this day. Quick List of ‘the hardest part of AT’:1) any part in the rain2) tough terrain3) tough elevation4) that section between every hikers ears (this is actually #1)Tough terrain is a pain because though the trail is “flat”, you can’t make any time because every step is difficult. That’s Maine. Even the easy ain’t easy. In the late hours of the day as I shuffled along slowly, I see a couple ahead on the trail walking toward me and I hear the woman call out, “Is that Daddy Longlegs?” I didn’t know who it could possibly be and stopped in front of her trying to figure out where I’d met this hiker. “I’m Butterfly... we met in Port Clinton last year”. Whoa! What a small world. Last year I slack-packed into Port Clinton with Nemo and McGyver and, after a few cocktails at the Fire Station, we ended up at the end of town with Renegade, Antman, Giggles, Switchback, Butterfly, Trainwreck,etc and took over the pavilion park. A fine evening! What a small world. The trail is so long (but, as her husband Brandt remarked, it’s only “this” wide -holding his hands arms length apart) and yet here we were. We chatted for a moment as my hiker zombie brain thought back to last summer and then they took off (she finished her thru hike and they were just out doing the 100Mile Wilderness) ... but it recharged my failing feet and I rolled on from Crescent pond a few more miles to the Rainbow Springs Lean-to. Had done 20 miles and rain was falling: decided to hit the Shelter. Another Georgia boy (Hop Along) was there so I chatted with Hop Along as more folks showed up.

At 5:30am I laid in the shelter awake planning my day.  Didn’t want to be the guy that wakes everyone but, by 6:00 I made a move, and at 6:48 I was headed north. I needed to move at 3mph today. All day. That doesn’t sound like much but that’s pretty strong out here in the big woods. The elevation profile seemed favorable and roots/rocks would have to be dealt with. 
Keep On Truckin’! The Loons were all cheering me on and I passed ‘The Canadians’ (cool section hikers from Nova Scotia nicknamed Fireball & Capt Morgan for the bottles of whiskey they carried) 2 hours in. They wished me well and I kept truckin’ as had covered 6.2 miles. Ran into Prodigal on The Ledges, checked for cell service, called the hostel in Millinocket and inquired about the shuttle (Rats!- it leaves Katahdin at 4pm. Thirty minutes earlier than I expected but happy I checked), and checked progress: 3 hours = 8.9 miles. Time to haul ass...got out of the 100 mile wood (5 days!) and crossed the Penobscot River on Abol Bridge a few minutes before noon with over 15 miles behind me. 
Got a cheeseburger and a cup of coffee @ Abol Campground store and rested for 30 minutes before rolling hard down the road. Signed in at Baxter State Park Ranger station at 12:50. Told them my plan and,  since there were 9.8 miles to go, they said to ‘get after it’. Now this stretch is as easy as it comes in Maine and I found myself, despite weary feet, enjoying walking along the river amongst huge pines and thousands of tiny blue flowers. Lots of waterfalls and a few stream crossings...I stopped to hug a few trees and take a few pictures but kept stretching those Longlegs out toward the mountain...

The northern terminus of the AT is Baxter Peak, more affectionately referred to by its Indian name: Mount Katahdin. This is the tallest mountain in Maine and considered by most to be the ‘best finish’ of any of the country’s long trails. Now there is only one more day to go...
Spending the day just resting and reflecting at the AT Lodge in Millinocket. To borrow a phrase: “What a long, strange trip it’s been!” Hasn’t gone at all as I had imagined. 
Despite all the difficulties...
Despite all the setbacks... 
...here I sit just 5.2 miles from summit. The “finish” line. It has taken extraordinary patience, love, and help from my family to reach this point. I am in awe of their heartfelt efforts to make this dream a reality. 
Thinking on it, am sure that this isn’t an ‘end’ but a beginning. While it certainly marks the close of this AT journey, deep down I hope, & believe, it is just a doorway to a new walk. A walk with lessons learned from the experience. I trust that a more relaxed, optimistic, empathetic, and patient man keeps walking on the trail down from Mount Katahdin. These are not qualities people would readily ascribe to me in the past, but I plan to live such that they will in the future. 
It’s been fun having a ‘trail journal’ online and really appreciate all of you that have taken time to tag along here. I don’t “do” social media. Am not on Facebooks or Twitter or Instagram.

ALL of YOUR thoughts, prayers, well wishes are the fuel that kept me moving when the darkness tried to take me. When broken legs brought forth thoughts of broken dreams, your support made the difference. Thanks for getting me here...will be thinking of you during tomorrow’s hike.

Early rise, hit the AT cafe at 5:30am, then at 6:30am the shuttle leaves for the park.

Friday the 21st was a ZeroRestDay and went well. A great celebratory dinner probably involved a couple more rounds of beverages than any of us should have had (given the task early the next day) but hiker midnight (9pm) found us back in the AT Lodge and hitting the bunks. Did not sleep very well though and, when Projigal’s alarm went off at 4:30am, popped right up and got dressed—it’s Summit Saturday! At 5:07am walked through the door of the AT Cafe down the street and had a big breakfast. At 6:10am our van, piloted by NoKey, hauled 13 hikers to the Ranger station at Katahdin Stream Campground to attempt the summit. (Ultimately, 5 of us would make it. The other 8 turned back due to weather conditions on the way up the mountain. The Dudley Trail and Knife Edge Trails we’re closed due to the hazardous conditions) 
At 7:34am my registration & safety discussions with the Rangers were complete and I began the ascent. The first two miles were an easy climb and passed a myriad of day hikers as I moved up to the end of the tree line. The sound of the wind and the temperature change began in earnest in that last 1/4 mile before the alpine zone. Breaking above the trees, the howling wind cut thru my T-shirt and long sleeve base layer. More clothes were needed so I ducked behind a boulder to retrieve my ‘puffy’ coat, stocking cap, scorpion gloves, and rain jacket. Having suited up for the below freezing temperature, I moved up around the boulders to find 3 hikers under a rock ledge waiting. Went on up the trail just as two more young men came back down around past me hollering, “it’s blowing too strong up at the...” and then I was hit by the wind. Blowing 40...gusting 50... I got low and crabbed to a rock wall. Bolted into the top edge of it, 9 ft above, was a rebar handle. Put a toe in a crevice and reached up to it—-pulling myself up when WHOooSHHH! From low and left was struck by the wind, lost grip of the bar with my left hand but held fast with the right as the gust tried to throw me off the shelf.  Holy shit!
In a virtual panic, dropped back down and looked for a place to get out of the wind. Jumped into a low spot and grabbed my head in my hands. I had almost been blown off the mountain! To my right, the mountain fell away about 30 feet sheer to the tree tops. 
Dammit! I can’t go on. I can’t go over that.  What the hell? I can’t finish... adrenaline coursed through me and I racked my brain to think coherently. Deep breath...
I can’t make it. 
2,187 miles ...and I can’t make it!
You have to go! 
No! No, you can’t be that guy that walks all this way and does some completely stupid thing and dies! Thought about my wife and kids. Their faces raced through my mind...
I can’t risk it. 
I can’t make it.  
Then a figure runs over low and jumps down next to me. It’s Gusher. He looks up and shouts in the gale, “what’s up?” I said something like we have to go up ...but I tried and couldn’t make it. Started babbling about wind, and that I almost died but held on...(Later, sitting around victoriously in the bar, Gusher would say that the look at that moment on my face scared the crap out of him) “What do we do? There are about two dozen people back under that ledge” he hollers.
“We wait” I told him.
The wind kept screaming. Two minutes passed. (It felt like much more) Then the noise subsided a bit as the wind held steady without gusting. Three people appeared on the trail up from the ledge below, stared at us, and the first guy grabbed the bar and went up. Stood and watched him turn into the wind and move low across the shelf above as the next guy went up. I turned to Gusher and said, “This is it! C’mon!” Right on the heels of the third hiker, I went up
And over
And then to a rebar hand hold and dropped into a rock cleft. Twenty five  feet later we were past the knob, and we moved up thru the clouds. 
In a mile we reached the “table land”. This is the flattish alpine zone leading slightly upwards to the summit. The wind was sustained 25-30mph here, and it was at our backs, so it was like walking on the moon. Was ‘flown’ across the table land in big lunging steps holding out my arms like a sail ... visibility was just 30-40 yds in the clouds then, in the last 100 yds, the wind picked up. Then the infamous sign emerged from the mist.
While crossing the table land my mind raced. Perhaps it was the adrenaline that had been coursing through me all day but it got emotional at times. Thinking about family, the course of events leading to this Moment, the miles (so SO many miles) that came before... emotions stared roiling inside me.  A few memories forced tears to well up ...but after a moment things would come back under control. Then the summit sign appeared.
Wow. 
Even if you’ve never been up there, if you are reading trail journals, you know what that sign looks like. I did. But I had no idea it would look like THAT. 
All of it. All the memories. All the what if’s and wonders. All the great friends. All the shitty rains. All the delays, the hopes and dreams. ALL of it hit me.  I stood about 15 feet away and tears came. Joyous ones. One tough endeavor conquered. It took much longer than imagined and tested me every step. Yes!
Walked up to the icy wooden sign and slapped the rough surface a few times (play like a champion today). Yep, real. 
Reached into my pack and pulled out the “Bamahiker” stone i’ve carried since picking it up in Fontana Dam 2,000+ miles ago. (Took a picture of it to send to Ms. BStyles) Handed my camera to another hiker to take my pic on the sign. The wind was howling (and it was hard to stand on) but got “the photo”.  Unfurled the flag that was carried from the start, having been signed by 100s of hikers that walked with me on the AT, and got “the photo” with it as well. Then I went to just sit away from the sign and soak it in. Gusher arrived (put on an orange Tuxedo) and got his photo. Then Liam arrived. Followed by Eavesdropper and TreeHugger. For a moment it was all of us there in the clouds celebrating. Sincere congratulations and adulation for each other’s accomplishment. We all walked the same trail but everyone hiked their own hike. Quite a moment after the all the anticipation building amongst us for the last few weeks. 
The temp & wind forced some to head on back but Gusher and I decided to stay for awhile. The clouds were lifting and visibility improving. After 45 minutes or so the “Knife’s Edge” to Pamola Peak appeared. Soon the cloud ceiling rose up from 3,500 to over 10,000 ft and we could see for miles. The walk down offered amazing vistas I had no idea existed (as the ascent was up through the clouds). We moved slowly and safely. Reports from other thru hikers we met on the way down were later confirmed on the rangers clipboard...dozens of hikers had turned back at “the knuckle” in the morning. (Many finished on Sunday- Congrats!) Even in the afternoon clarity and diminished wind, this was the windiest section on the way down as well. Once in the trees we strolled and chatted. Technically speaking, our “hike” was over so I guess we were simply friends strolling thru the woods. Giant silly grins and laughing all the way down... 
In the last 1/4 mile, a figure stood in the path and a few hikers in front of me passed him. I know that guy: Mike! My buddy, who texted me ‘Good Morning’ every day of my hike without fail, had flown up from Tennessee to join me. (In 1994 we had sat in my room in Highlands, NC as I weighed my gear and packed mail drops for the AT walk that would quickly fail) He gave me a big hug shouting ‘Way to go!’ and the other guys realized he wasn’t just another day Hiker. All came over to say hello, then we walked to the car, grabbed beers (well done, Mike) and sat in the Park toasting the journey. It was early & since the shuttle would be hours, Mike drove a car load of smelly hikers back to Millinocket. We went by the AT Lodge, picked up the gear left there, made plans for later, and went to Park Edge inn. Cleaned up and joined other hikers for dinner at the Scootic In bar.
 It was one of those nights. The joy of the day wasn’t easily extinguished. Kind strangers picked up our tab for us. (Was being paid forward all around the bar) Debbie, the hardest working waitress in America, kept the pours heavy so we stayed ‘til our lids were heavy. [Note*she had served my breakfast up the street at 5am this very morning, as she had the day before and would again tomorrow] Lying in bed trying to make sense of the last 20+ hours was impossible. The adrenaline had finally given out and the day closed. 
{update: The next day we drove to Acadia down east on the coast. My flight home was made with enough projected cushion for a slower pace, bad weather event, or some other unknown. The wonderful weather of the past few weeks allowed me to get ahead of schedule. As well as a chance to see another aspect of this amazing state, Maine. Walked along Cadillac Mtn, largest mountain on the Atlantic coast, this morning and could see Saddleback and Katahdin almost 100 miles off to the northwest. Stunning...another reason to keep walking!}
Life is Amazing. Find YOUR reason ...and Keep Walking!
