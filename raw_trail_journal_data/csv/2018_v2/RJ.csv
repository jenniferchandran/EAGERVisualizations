RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585381,Bought my ticket for a 26 hour train ride.  Hopefully it will be somewhere near on time.  Shuttle from Gainesville is all set.,"

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585382,I now have everything that I'm going to start with.  New pad is 8.5 oz which is better than the 14 oz that the old one was.  Hopefully it will be sufficient. I'm concerned about what I'm reading about the Noro virus so I'm bringing Aqua Mira drops as well as my filter.  I'm leaving the alcohol stove home this trip.  I almost started a fire with it last time.  This year I'm bringing a canister stove.,"

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586946,"Off to a show start because of the weather.  Today was better with only rain, wind and cold instead of driving rain, wind and cold. Stayed in a hostel last night at Woody Gap and tonight I have HEAT and electricity in a cabin in Neel's Gap. Caught a cold so I'm hoping to be able to sleep tonight.  Today was tough. I climbed Blood Mountain, elevation 4400 feet without breakfast, but did it faster than I would have wanted to.  It was the only way to stay warm.  Have completed 31 miles so far and hope to make it to Low Gap tomorrow.  There's a shelter there and it's about 11 miles from here. Supposed to warm up by Wednesday.  It's only been in the 20's!  Everything I have is wet!","Gainesville, Georgia
",Neels Gap,"Apr 16, Mon",11
RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587044,Just finished climbing Poor mountain and there are two more miles to my destination for the night - Low Gap Shelter (mile 42.9).  At Tesnatee Gap (mile 37)  I came across an elderly guy (probably my age) who was passing out free drinks and snacks. I'm enjoying the different sounds that the birds in this area make.  Saw a resident Bard owl diving for mice in broad daylight.  It's sunny today with a gentle breeze and the temperature seems to be about 65.  Tonight is supposed to be chilly but in the 80's tomorrow.  My cold is much better.,"Neels Gap

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587159,"Life is great today!  It's 80 degrees, sunny and I'm within sight of a restaurant that serves beer. I have a private room with a shower and look forward to a nice meal tonight. Tough going today on the down hills but at the bottom were two different groups serving anything imaginable to eat and drink.  Best coke I ever had! I feel good but think I'm going to go hut to hut for a while in order to keep the mileage down because of the rugged climbs ahead. My cold is almost gone and I'm going to stock up on sun screen before I leave here tomorrow.  There are no leaves yet on the trees and I'll need that sun protection.","Low Cap Shelter

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587238,"Tough day today.  Started at elevation of 2949', climbed Tray Mountain to 4430', down again to 3304', then up to where I am now at Sassafras Gap at 3500'. I'm tired!  It's cold this afternoon and there is a frost warning for tonight.  It's amazing the difference between being in a town at low altitude and in the mountains.  In the mountains there are no leaves yet on the trees and in the towns the maple seeds are falling. My tent is up and I think it's going to be an early night.
It was interesting last night getting that beer!  First I was proofed.  I found it hard to believe that at my age I look anything other than my 75 years, but nonetheless I did have to prove it.  There was only one person licensed in the restaurant who could serve beer. She made a point of coming over to tell me. Totally different beer experience from what I'm used to in New York State! 
I'm headed tomorrow for Deep Gap Shelter.","Hiawassee
",Sassafras Gap,"Apr 19, Thu",10.40
RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587384,"Very cold night!  No one got any sleep.  I wore every piece of clothing that I brought including my rain gear and I was still cold.  Yes, I should have brought my warmer sleeping bag but it was heavier to carry.  At least the wind died down after sundown but there was ice everywhere this morning.  I did buy warmer socks today.  A 25 year old 11 passenger van shuttled 15 of us and fifteen backpacks into town.  What a sight!  Thankfully his brakes held going downhill to town.  3 days of rain are predicted starting Sunday with lows in the 40's.  Once it starts I think I'll stay in shelters instead of my tent. Because the trail loops in a sort of triangle here I'm back in Hiawassee tonight at the Budget Inn.  I'm going to start out tomorrow showered, with clean clothes and well fed! The shuttle leaves at 9 am.
People here are so nice!  A group of hikers were sitting in front of the hostel just talking when I guy pulled up in a pick up truck and asked if anyone wanted a beer.  Church and scout groups travelled 3 hours to set up tables loaded with food and drinks.","Sassafras Gap

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587621,"Took a shuttle from Deep Gap at mile 85.1 to Franklin, North Carolina.  It's cold and rain is coming soon.  It was close to 32 last night and in anticipation of even colder, wet weather, I'm going to stay two nights here at Gooder Grove Hostel.  Quite a place - Franklin, NC.  Population is about 2000 with over 40 churches.  Yesterday was tough climbing from Bly Gap at 3840 to Couthouse Bald at 4708'. Hostel is full up tonight and because it's Sunday, everything is closed.  So tomorrow I'll get groceries and go to the outfitter store.
Met a woman from Olean, NY who knows my mother's family. Small world! Still trying to fight off my cold but other than that I feel good and will return to Deep Gap on Tuesday.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587767,"Rainy and cold here today so this is a good place to rest up and wait out the rain.  Had some more Southern hospitality last night.  The owner of the Gooder Grove Hostel  bought us hikers 4 large pizzas and told us to have at 'em.  I like the house rules here:  Be kind, Be kind of clean, and Enjoy Being.  Just finished dinner at the Lazy Hiker Brewery.  They let us buy dinner at the food truck outside and eat in the brewery.  We have an 11 am shuttle tomorrow back to the trail.  My goal is Carter Shelter at mile 93.6 but first I have to get over the 5435' of Standing Indian Mountain. Bought a shirt today and hope it will keep me warmer!","Franklin, North Carolina
",Staying dry,"Apr 23, Mon",0
RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587898,Very tough day today.  It poured all day and temps have stayed around 40 I think.  Walked through 2 - 4 inches of water all day.  Can't stay warm or dry.  Everything I own is wet. My feet are soaked.  I'm staying in my tent tonight though because the shelter is absolutely packed with humanity. Hard to shake this chest cold. I'm going to try to make it to Rock Gap tomorrow and call for a shuttle .,"Franklin, North Carolina

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587988,"Easy to see why people call this area America's Rain Forest.  It was still raining this morning but I did manage to get some sleep last night.  Got to the top of Albert Mountain (5250 feet) and it was sunny!  I laid out everything to dry as best I could.  I'm spending the night at Rock Gap Shelter (mile 105.7)  Weather prediction for tomorrow is 100% chance of rain.  If it's raining when I get up, I'll call for a shuttle into Franklin and wait it out.","

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588085,"As I was leaving Rock Gap a shuttle angel was waiting in anticipation of water logged hikers.  She brought us back to Gooder Grove Hostel where I spent the day resting, drying out, and getting warm.  I bought a sleeping bag liner that is supposed to make my sleeping bag 20 degrees warmer.  Never thought it would be this cold at the end of April.  Had a nice breakfast and had my laundry done and will stay in a private room tonight.  Went to the store for yogurt and got soaked.  Will definitely where my rain gear when I go to dinner!  It's still raining hard.  When I was at this same hostel a couple of nights ago one of the hikers who is a chef made 3 big pans of lasagna.  We had it for dinner and breakfast!  The shuttle tomorrow is at 7 am.  Rain is forecast to stop about 10.  Then we should have a stretch of good weather. Hope to make it to Siler Bald Shelter (mile 113.7) tomorrow.  I think it will be a slow and easy day. Other than sore knees, and being cold and wet, life is great!  My cold is better.","Rock Gap Shelter
