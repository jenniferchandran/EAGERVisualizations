Clank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573452,"Well I would like to introduce myself because I finally made  up my mind to start my journal for my 2018 through hike of the Appalachian Trail. Approximately One and a half years ago I decided to hike the Appalachian Trail and have been making preparations ever since to make that dream come true. I love hiking and the outdoors and i've been hiking on and off since the mid-70s  when I started at 17 years old hiking along sections of the Appalachian Trail in the Shenandoah national Park where occasionally me and my best friend Mike Krieger would come across thru hikers headed from Georgia to Maine and said to ourselves that we would do that one day. Mike was murdered in 1989  and I believe I let the dream of thru hiking slip away.  Fast forward to 2017 where I now live in Oklahoma and can not wait every year to cooler weather hits when I hike in the Ozarks in Arkansas and Oklahoma. Now I have made that commitment to hike the Appalachian Trail, with the support of family and friends to help me make that dream come true and to carry Mike's memory from Georgia to Maine and I look forward to meeting many of you along the way.",,View Entry,"Jul 28, Fri",0
Clank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578135,I finally started my conditioning hikes for preparation for my March 2018 thru hike  of the Appalachian Trail by heading out to Vancouver with my son  to hike the mountains just north of Vancouver we started at sea level on the Baden Powell trail which then took us up to about 4500 feet where we met up with       The Howe sound crest Trail  these two trails were two of the toughest trails I've ever done steep almost vertical inclines scrambling over boulders scooting across ledges with 1000 feet drop on each side which made it one of the most exciting hikes I've ever done very physically challenging but it was awesome took us 3 1/2 days to complete those two trails got to Swim in some mountain lakes. My next hikes will be coming up in October in the Ozarks and I'm getting pretty excited about hitting the AT in march,"

Clank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579265,"I'm finally ready to start conditioning and more pack shakedown hikes so I'm planning a hike the end of November 70 miles going to try to get it done in four nights 5 days of hiking, if anyone is interested in joining me to prep for 2018 the trail will be the Ouachita Trail starting at the state line headed east.",,Ozarks,"Oct 08, Sun",0
Clank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581987,"Well I haven’t posted in a while but I’ve been busy with my Appalachian Trail preparation hikes since November I’ve hiked 50 miles of the Ouachita trail, The white rock mountain trail two times and Butterfield Trail  at devils den state park.   The last hike at White rock mountain was a cold-weather hike with Temperatures down to 19° and I was able to check out my cold-weather gear which worked out really nice. At this point I really believe them ready for the Appalachian Trail I’ve decided that My  start date is March 21 starting in Harpers Ferry and going south to Springer Mountain and I’m getting pretty excited.  A lot of my preparation from here on out will be physical conditioning and trail planning for resupply.",,View Entry,"Jan 08, Mon",0
Clank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583822,"Getting pretty excited about my hike I leave in 10 days and it's really sinking in that I will be hiking the Appalachian trail all 22 hundred miles. Starting to say goodbye to my contractors and. Friends is a little harder than I thought it would be. My business Joy Marble and Tile is in excellent hands and support my passion of hiking and I believe they will do everything they can to see that I complete the whole trail.
        At this time I have pretty much finished my resupply options with my wife who will be shipping me my resupply boxes and my support on the home front and I just finished a conditioning hike in preparation for what is to come.
        So for friends who are following and are curious why Clank is on the web address it was a trail name that was given to me on my hike last year in the smokies on a 100 mile hike. Hikers on the AT give each other a trail name which most hikers go by. I received this name because I had some equipment on the outside of my backpack which was making a lot of noise and a lady thought it would be fitting to call me Clank. I have since toned down m noise so I might end up with a new name once I get on the trail.",,View Entry,"Mar 09, Fri",0
Clank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584978,Well after a snow delay last week I made it on the trail yesterday afternoon starting at Harpers Ferry weather was good ice going up the first hill my yak tracks came in handy and stayed last night at David lesser memorial shelter And I made it to Bears den hostel  for the night seems like they really know how to take care of hikers. Feeling a little sore but that’s to be expected I saw four deer in camp this morning that was pretty cool and now I’m hiking through what they call the roller coaster a lot of ups and downs Tomorrow pizza and ice cream for dinner woo hoo,"

Clank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586248,"Well after two weeks of being fairly uneventful the third week has proven to be more challenging  yesterday I took my first fall when two hikers coming up the hill and I meet at the same spot and I had to step down off a rock and when I did I went  clanking down the Boulder got little banged up but hurt my ego mainly Then I pitched a tent to wake up with it covered in snow So I hurried and got all my gear together skipping breakfast to try to make it to the next shelter which was 3 1/2 miles up the trail Got to the shelter and got them packed up my sleeping bag out another hiker named Right On showed up we talked for a little bit got in our sleeping bags  and after 30 minutes decided to pack up and head for the road I would’ve had to lay there for 12 to 14 hours in the freezing cold so I made it back to the hostel for a night in a warm bed and a good meal.      It’s been kind of neat meeting hikers a lot of northbound thru hikers I’ve met walkie-talkie, scoutmaster, Overhill, peanut butter and jelly, right on, opa, fairy floss, roam, ghost,  cheesesteak, lucky boy, now or never, possible, yolo, tank, Hannibal, caretaker, footprint, And a few more that I’d forgotten their names.  So tomorrow I have two big climbs up Three Ridges peak and then the Priest, Both at almost 4000 feet elevation I just hope the snow is melted enough  so it won’t be so slick the weather supposed to start warming up this week and be up in the 70s by the end of the week.","

Clank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587276,Well I haven’t made a post in 10 days so I’ll catch you up to speed about a week and a half ago coming out of Waynesboro Virginia I kind of hit a wall and I was only getting about 12 miles a day or less. I took a zero day and Glasgow Va. because I was just feeling wore out and Sunday I got a pizza and Monday I woke up with stomach issues let’s just say I couldn’t stop going to the bathroom  I got back on the trail with this problem and was still doing pretty good got up on top of Thunderhill mountain at the shelter and set up my tent the temperature had dropped  down into the 20s with a 30 mile an hour wind so I ate some dinner got in my tent and just about when I was ready to fall asleep I had to run to the bathroom it was about 11 o’clock at night so instead of  going up to the privy which I knew I would never make I went down the hill dug my hole did my business and started back up the hill and couldn’t find  my tent couldn’t find it  and the thought hit me that I was going to freeze to death the wind was howling I was still headed up the hill when finally I ran into the shelter right before I started screaming help thank God then I knew where my tent was from there man was I scared. So for the last four days I have average 14 miles a day so it’s getting better weather is getting better And I’m looking for more ways to get my pack way down I just got my resupply here in Daleville that my wonderful wife sent me  Who has been my support on the homefront she’s been a huge help. I’ve lost about 15 pounds I think I’m starting to look a little thin and with stomach issues that hasn’t helped I think my body is just Trying to adapt. The terrain  is still tough usually climbing anywhere from 3500 to 5000 feet in elevation every day which is basically like walking out of the bottom of the Grand Canyon every day but with my new resupply of changing out my shoes to trail runners  getting rid of some heavy winter gear so I think it’s going to get at least a pound or two later which doesn’t sound like much but you can certainly feel it. Haven’t seen any bears yet still seeing a lot of deer and the views are spectacular certainly an amazing journey so far I’ll keep you posted,"
