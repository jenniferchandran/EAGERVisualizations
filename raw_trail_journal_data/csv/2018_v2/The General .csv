I've lost 50lbs but need to loose another 40 before i hit the trail (long way to go).

Good Friday. Started the day out at the Franklin 1st Baptist Church eating pancakes and bacon. Got dropped off at the trail about 9:30 and started hiking. It was overcast and cool. I had to take my long sleeve shirt off for a few hours because the weather was so mild. I passed my 2nd hiker today. I’m a real speed demon. Not sure how many hikers passed me but it had to be over a dozen. It’s a common occurrence. 
Knee prognosis:  very good
After many short days and 3 zero days I feel I’m 98% normal (the knee not my sanity).  It aches very little right now but it’s what I expect after hiking up and down mountains all day I’m planning a 10 mile day tomorrow. 
I met two guys from the trail club that overlooks this part of the trail today. They were out surveying their part to see if any repairs need to be done. There are 3 big trees that have blown down over the trail that need to be cut away.  I made it around one over one and as I tried to climb over the last tree my foot slipped and as I’m straddling this tree I’m now sliding downhill. I was able to stop myself by grabbing on to a little bitty sapling. It was really funny but if I had not caught myself I would have ended up down a very steep hill. As I was hiking up my last mountain of the day I heard someone yell out my name it was “5 oh”. I had not seen him for a week. Very scenic view on top of the mountain so I got a few pictures. Made it to the shelter about 5:30 and was able to secure a spot. So once again I do not have to put up my tent.  Going to get cold tonight so 4 of us hikers are playing snuggle buddy. 4 bodies in a space made for 3. It keeps everyone warm.","Winding Stairs Gap

The General ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585492,Absolutely brutal day due to several hard and steep climbs and descents. I also did not eat dinner the night before and had a small breakfast. I did some fast hiking early morning and actually hiked with “Burger King” “5 oh” and “Velma” for several hours. Shortly after 3pm I struggled down the Mountain into Telico Gap I hadn’t seen my hiking friends since about 11:30 but there they were just laying on the grass resting under the sun waiting for me. They had obtained some trail magic early and even got me some. I ate a hotdog brownie and an orange.  It was very nice of them get something for me. We had another 2.2 miles to go so about 4pm we saddled up and climbed 1.5 miles up the next mountain and than started are downhill run to the shelter. We ran into some search and rescue people who are out looking for a missing hiker. We got some pictures to put up in the shelter.   I also saw a snake. It was small but it didn’t like me. I walked past it and didn’t see him at first but heard a noise. When I turned and looked it was all wound up ready to strike. The little buger needs to chill out and share the trail. It was a beautiful day today with very few clouds in the sky. I started out in a jacket and gloves but those came off fast. Once again I’m sleeping in a shelter.,"Wayah Shelter

With a little over 6 miles to hike leaving at 10am was no problem. I had a little bit of a uphill hike to start the day and when I got to my highest point I took a break to loose my jacket and gloves. I also broke out a book I’ve been reading called “Living Water the Gospel of John”. Today being Easter I read about the resurrection. 
I started my downhill hike. It was as brutal as I thought it was. Knees do not like downhill. About a mile to go I ran into “5 oh” and “Velma”. I dropped my pack and joined them on a nice sunny spot in the woods. We left about an hour later for are final slog and a hamburger.

Little flowers and plants are starting to bloom and you can see the buds on the trees. 
Lots of hikers showed up at the shelter today. Most hikers will tent near the shelter but some of us are Shelter dogs and love the shelter life. Thus shelter has space for 6 but only 4 were in it. I met moonbeam and crises today also I met vapor and boss who are a married couple. Boss walks in front of vapor and describes every step to him (Vapor) because he is blind. What an amazing couple.

As I was hiking this morning I was also grieving at the passing of my mom. The song “Softly and Tenderly” came to mind. So I was hiking and singing

Life is wonderful  
Moonbeam and Crises caught up with me near the top of our last climb and for the next hour I was hiking with them. Guess what the knee said?  That’s right s “nope, you will slow down”.  Had to slow to a crawl again at the last 1.5 Miles.   I found my hiking music also today. Credence Clearwater revival. Great songs for fast pace. Until the knee got all out of sorts.

Moved to the Fontana Hilton from the lodge.

Zero Day:  A day in which no trail miles were hiked
Nero: A Day in which only a few miles were hiked
Since the shuttle picked me up at the AT Crossings and dropped me off at the Shelter I missed 1.2 miles of the trail.  (Maybe I ought to count this a Nero instead of a zero day). To make up for this I slacked pack south to where I got off the trail and than reversed directions and headed north back to the shelter. It was a good test of my knee. It passed with flying colors. I hope it stays that way cause I’ve got some higher miles I need to put in this next week.

Then the climb began. Over 4 miles of up. I took some pictures of beautiful scenery but found out later that my camera lens was fogged over. When I got to the top of the mountain it was still covered in snow. It had rain first and the water froze on the trees. All day I heard and saw ice dropping from the trees. As you might imagine that with ice and snow it’s cold up here. I’ve got my down booties to sleep with to help keep me warm. They are the talk of the shelters. And many hikers are envious. They are also in awe of my 3 pillows. I do believe in my comforts. In the Smokies you have to stay in the shelter unless they are full. A lot of hikers hate this because they want to tent. I’m okay with shelters and prefer them at this time. Once it’s hot and the bugs are out I’ll be in my tent.,"Fontana Dam Hilton

Today was dreary.  Hike in a cloud all day. The trail was a horrible mess.  For every 1 step you took you would slide back some. Most of the trail was mud and muck. Hard hiking conditions. So far I’ve seen 3 shelters in the Smokies and they are all the same. The rest of the tail I’ve been on the Shelters have been very different from one another. So far the Smokies have been cold and wet. I’ll be glad to have a weather change.

Night Hiking - any hiking when it’s dark outside and you are using your headlamp to see the trail
Trail Magic - A gift received by a hiker. It could be almost anything. Common trail magic are pieces of fruit, a candy bar, clean water, soda, coffee or hot chocolate. Some time you may arrive at a road crossing and a trail angel has set up a full blown cook out to include Hamburgers hotdogs etc. trail magic may even be a kind word or prayer when you are down. 
Trail Angel - a person who provides trail magic
Several events today:

My 1st night hike 
My 1st hitchhike 
Went over the 200 mile mark
Stood at the highest point on the AT

Got up at 3:30 this morning and on the trail before 4:30 using a headlamp to light the trail. It was my 1st night hike. I used the headlamp for about 2 hours before it became light enough to see the trail. Many of us wanted to be on top of the highest point on the AT (Clingmans Dome) at sunrise to take some pictures. We had over 3 miles to hike mostly on steep climbs. It was a very clear morning and the stars were very bright. Temperature was high 30’s which was higher than we have been used to. My toes never got cold and I was able to finish all my morning task of packing up without lengthy delays to warm up my fingers. On the climb up today I felt very tired like I had no energy. It was getting colder as we climbed and at 3/4 of the way I finally took a break, rested, and ate a chocolate honey bun. I finally made it to the top before sunrise and was able to get some pictures. It was freezing on top of the observation tower with temps in the 20’s and a 15 to20 mile per hour wind. I came off the tower quickly to try to rest out of the wind but couldn’t find a good spot so off I went hiking down the trail. It took about 40 minutes of hiking to finally warm up my fingers. Shortly after 10am I decided that my best course of action would be to go into Gatlinburg for resupply. To catch the 12:30 shuttle I needed to hike to Newfound Gap at a speed unheard of by my bad knee.   I had 5 miles of hard hiking to do. I sped down the trail with wild abandon and made it to the parking lot at 12:20. The shuttle had left 3 minutes earlier so I was out of luck and to top it off a trail angel had just left also so I didn’t even get trail magic. The shuttle is trail magic provided by the 1st Baptist Church of Gatlinburg. Let me say thank you to the church  for helping so many hikers. After a short rest I and 2 others hikers hitched a ride in the back of a pickup. 
Went to Cicis pizza 1st thing and than found where everyone was staying and went to meet them. Food, hotel, and outfitter were all within one block of each other. We had to take the tram to the other side of town to resupply at the grocery store.  It was after 10 before I got back to my room so I decided to zero tomorrow and rest my knee and get some other chores done.","Double Spring Gap Shelter

Awoke at 6 this morning to get a shower pack my backpack and grab some breakfast.  MacNasty shared my room yesterday and we are on the same hiking schedule. He is a much faster hiker but we seem to end up at a lot of the same shelters. The restaurant opened at 7 and we were there ready for the morning feast. After breakfast we checked out of the hotel and walked across the street to the outfitters to grab the shuttle that the 1st Baptist Church provides. It was 8 and we had about a 30 minute wait. 5 minutes after we got there a panel van from the church showed up and said they were heading up to the mountain to act as trail angels. We grabbed a ride with him and was able to get on the trail earlier than we thought. Plus we got some trail magic on the way. 
The morning weather in Gatlinburg was fantastic.  Mild temps and clear sky’s. As we drove into the mountains the temps were dropping and there was clouds. 
I started out at 9am and had a very good day the sun came out about 1pm but there was a cold wind blowing all day. A lot of scenic views and I hike along a couple of knife edges. A very neat day of hiking. My knee did very good as I hiked over 10 miles with little discomfort, and I did it fast. what I mean is “John fast”, not hiker fast.

At first it seemed the trees were throwing ice down at me and as I kept descending it became a rain storm as the snow and ice melted before it fell. It was kind of neat watching it rain when it was sunny  out. I finally left the Smokies which means I do not have to hike shelter to shelter. I can stop anytime now.

It’s amazing how it went from freezing in the snow to near 80 degrees and sunny. 
Note:  I found out later that I was not the only one who stopped short of there goal. Several hikers stopped at the first shelter they came to after the hostel so they only did a 7.5 mile day. 
Did you notice that I said I stopped and pitched my tent. I can do that now because I’m not in the Smokies. I can stop almost anywhere anytime I want now.

I met her in Gatlinburg and have crossed paths several times. I met up with McNasty at the hostel and found out that my efforts to catch him was useless because he was behind me. He had stopped at a shelter that I bypassed 3 days ago and I had been in front of him since. I also met up with Hooters and and Kermit.  They have been ahead of me for awhile but are taking multiple zeros due to bad ankles. They are two lovely German ladies that I first met on day 2 back at Gooch Mountain Shelter. We have cross paths many times and now I am ahead of them again. 
Besides the normal things  of resupply, showery, washing clothes that you do during a zero day, today we had a party. They were having a Hiker Fest this weekend in Hot Springs and this evening we had a fish fry  and other activities. It was fun and very relaxing.

The General ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587692,"Still, that is how I would describe my hike today. It was very quiet. The wind was just a breeze and it was not even rustling the leaves. You would here a bird in the distance but otherwise it was very quiet. As usual there was a climb coming out of town and this was one of the steepest. The good thing was it was a short distance. Made it to the shelter last and there was no room so I set up my tent. The wind had started and the rain will be moving in about midnight. I hope I’ve got all my gear situated so nothing gets wet. I don’t want to hike and sleep in 40 degree weather for the next 4 days. We’ll try to do about 15 miles tomorrow and the next day to get out of the weather a day earlier.

Slack pack - Where you hike without your backpack. You may take a small daypack with only essentials like toilet paper, water filter, snacks to eat, and water. You either start your hike at your present point and someone brings your pack to you at the end of the day or you are dropped off up the trail and you hike back.   You will be shuttled back up the trail the next day to continue hour journey 

Yes yes, I know it’s been over a month since you’ve heard from me. Many of you have let me know. I’m sorry and will try much harder in the future to journal on a more consistent basis. 
I have been immersed in the beauty of the Appalachians. 
I’ve done over 300 miles since my last entry and tomorrow I will be starting at mile 656.1 and plan on doing about 18 miles. I may have to do shorter miles because of rain. It really sucks hiking in heavy rain all day. Not only is the trail like a little river you have to walk on but the mud is either sucking you in or making you slip and slide. It makes for slow hiking. Last week I hiked 5 out of 6 days in the rain. Two weeks before that it was 5 days of rain. Oh the upside the mountains are beautiful and full of green. I walk through a meadow full of yellow, white, and purple flowers. Besides the beauty of the setting I noticed a loud humming noise which came from hundreds of little bumblebees flittering from one flower to another. I past through the Grayson Highlands where I saw the wild ponies. They will come up to you and lick the salt off your skin. They will also try to eat your hiking pole straps and grips where your sweat has built up. 
While in the Grayson Highlands we encountered a bear. I did not see it but those that did said he was big. He had been raiding the shelter area and tent sites for food. The night I was in the area he was able to get 5 food bags. I was on the 2nd floor of the shelter along with 6 other hikers and we had our food bags with us. It seems he gets someones food bag almost every night.  They will either relocate him or kill him soon. 
Right now I am at the Angels Rest Hiker Hostel in Pearisburg VA. I have been here for 5 nights now. Why you ask?  Why are you not hiking?  
3 reasons

 I had over 150 mosquito bits and I wanted to get off the trail a little while to get some meds and heal up a bit
I’m exhausted. I think I’ve lost to much weight to fast and my body seemed to be weakening. 
I took a real bad fall on a hugh bolder/rock and bruised some ribs and my hip/butt. The doc said they were not broken ( I knew that) but I should rest a few days

Yesterday I slacked packed. The hostel dropped me off at a trail head 20 miles up the trail and I hiked back to the hostel. It was a good test of my body without carrying a 35 lb backpack. I did good so tomorrow the hostel will again drop me off up the trail but this time I’ll continue heading north carrying all my stuff. 
I’ll journal again soon. Bye now","Little Laurel Shelter

Day 88
Day 88 This was my first day back on the trail after taking a zero day in Daleville. I took the zero day to let my body rest after a grueling day. Why was it grueling you ask?
1st. I slipped on a big bolder and commenced to roll and slide and bounce down the side of a mountain for about 50 feet. I say 50 but it was more like 20 but this is my story and I am aloud to embellish. After climbing back up to the trail thanks to some strategically place trees to use as hand holes I took another fall shortly after that thanks to some rocks and roots that worked in concert to trip me up. A small tree got involved during this fall and I ended up snapping one of my hiking poles. This happened at the top of a section of trail known as the dragons tooth. A very hard mile that took over an hour to complete. Dragons tooth is a lot of  huge granite slabs that must be climbed down if you are head north. Most of the time I would have to toss my hiking poles below me as they were useless. It is a very technical rock scramble that at times I just had to sit on my butt and slide down. Other times I would have to use hand holds embedded in in the rocks. Made it to town finally and had a nice cold beer as my reward.
Day 89
It started raining last night around 10pm and rain for several hours but this morning I awoke to a beautiful clear day. There was a slight breeze and the morning temps were moderate so this morning hike was fantastic. My pace was good until about noon where I decided to stop after only 9.7 miles. I stopped at a campground where papa j was staying. It was his birthday and he was having a party. Lots of hikers stopped by and a good time was had by all. PapaJ was met by his wife,daughter and grandson so he was in very high spirits. 
After I arrived at the campgrounds and set up my tent I went to the cantina to get some food. 
Side note:  I had the best burger since I’ve been on the trail. 
I sat around talking to other backpackers eating and just having a relaxing time 
This was the 2nd day in a row that I felt great. The zero day I took in Troutville appeared to do wonders for me. Hope tomorrow will be the same.
Day 90
June 5
Thunder ridge Lookout to Jennings Creek 
(Southbound slack pack)
15.4 miles 
Another great day. I woke up feeling fantastic. I decided to slack pack today so I could avoid some long steep uphills. I got in 15.4 miles carrying only a water bottle and filter, toilet paper and snacks. 
I saw lots of north bounders that I’ve previously had met. One notable was Scooter who has an easy smile for everyone and everything. Today I passed him as he and others were climbing one of the mountains I avoided and he was not happy (no smile). I also met the Commander who I’ve heard about many times. Turns out he is retired Navy and retired the same year as I did. One of his previous commanding officers was Capt Piano who was my C.O. while I was aboard the Forrestal. (Small world). Now that we are within a few miles of each other we will be seeing each other and will be able to tell war stories. 
I passed under the guillotine (see picture) which was a really cool rock formation. But mostly today was a feet pounding knee jarring downhill hike.

Monday June 25
Day 110
I arrived here in Harpers Ferry last Friday and decided to take a couple of zero days to let my knee rest. I’m not sure if it’s working or not. I’ll probably see a doctor when I get to my daughter’s house. I’ve got only 195 miles and 15 days to make it to where she will pick me up. It will be a cakewalk. I get to spend a couple of days off the trail with her and my grandkids. As a bonus my wife will also be there. I live such a good life. 
When I checked in at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy I was the 970th thru hiker to check in. Lots of people have already dropped off the trail. The stats say another 25% of thru hikers will leave the trail before they reach Mt Katahdin. Only about 25% of hikers finish so just by making this far has increased my chances of making the whole thing. 
The cool thing that happened here at the hostel is I met “Texas Dreamer” and “Protege ”. They are out here on the trail for only a month and Texas Dreamer is chaperoning Protege. Protege is a young 16 year old high school student who will be starting her senior year this fall. She is keeping a extensive journal that will be part of a presentation that she has to give this coming school year and it’s a major portion of a grade she’ll receive in one of here classes. She is also planning to use this experience to write her college entrance essay. All very cool stuff. Texas Dreamer is an old family friend who has been on the trail before and also taught Protege how to knit when she was young. They’re both from Texas also so that makes them way cool.I learn about a bible verse yesterday that talks to long distance hikers.DEUTERONOMY 23:13“Each of you must have a spade as part of your equipment. Whenever you relieve yourself, dig a hole with the spade and cover the excrement.“

The General ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595475,"Just to be clear about whats happenings I want all y’all to know that I have finished Virginia and West Virginia. Along with Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee that’s 6 states complete.  Only 8 states left. 
Very easy trail today. I planned to hike 15 miles today but was waylaid by a trail angel at Gathland State Park. I had a fantastic turkey sandwich a Dr Pepper and good conversation. Before I knew it 2 hours had passed. 
I haven’t looked yet at what that means for tomorrow but I really don’t care. I’ll jut get up and start hiking. It’s easy terrain so maybe I’ll try to do 20 miles.

The General ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595770,"Today’s hike was relatively easy and flat. I did have a choice of bone shattering rocks and boulders and sucking mud. I guess my request for a yellow brick road was denied. 
It rained all last night and the trail was just horrible today. I started the hike in rain which was a surprise because the weather guru called for a nice day. After the 1st hour the day became very nice. Party cloudy with a nice breeze. The weather guru was right after all. 
I had so many wins today. 
High mileage 
Another state gone. Maryland is in the books. If you are keeping score that makes 7 down and 7 left. WIN
I’m officially out of the south and in the north regions. Not sure that’s a win but it’s different. How do I know I’m in the north?  Mr Dixon and Mr Mason says so. (See the  picture). When I took the picture I had one foot in the south (Maryland) and the other in the north (Pennsylvania). I was a man divided. 
Last win is I made it into town for resupply. 
I would have been out of food but a trail angel fed me yesterday and I still had one meal left.   If you make it to town with no food it’s a big win.  Food is weight and you don’t need to carry extra food. 
Staying the night in a real bed. No bugs, no one snoring in my ear, no gear getting damp because of relentless downpours.

Mud, rocks, roots , ups and downs etc.  All normal trail stuff today, nothing to hard or difficult. The trail was easy, my heel problem was hard.  Have I mentioned my foot problem? Probably not as it’s just a manifestation of a fat man pounding his feet against the unyielding earth for over a thousand miles. I was on the trail and hiking by 7:15 and by 7:30 the juice bugs (my term) were already swarming. A juice bug are those flying nats etc that buzz right in front of your face. They sometimes try to fly up your nose in your mouth or ears but mostly they fly right into your eyes to bask in that glorious eye juice right before they die. We all hate juice bugs.  I stopped for 2nd breakfast around 9:30 and was able to use the privy at the shelter I stopped at. As disgusting as privies are the still beats digging a cat hole. I was about to get some water at a nearby stream when an old guy came up and started talking to me.  He was one of the maintainers of the trail in this area. The shelter I was at was slated to be torn down this spring but was delayed due to weather. He said probably this fall. He also told me the next shelter has a spring nearby and it is probably the best water on the whole trail.  
I got water from a faucet 5 feet off the trail at a campground. It may not had been a delicious as spring water but it was easily obtainable. 
I hobbled to US Route 30 where there is a restaurant 0.4 miles down the rode so I thought why not. The double cheese burger with bacon and banana split was just what I needed.  I decide I didn’t want to hike to the next shelter/tenting area so I walked another 0.4 miles to a church hostel. Tomorrow is Sunday so maybe I’ll go to church.
