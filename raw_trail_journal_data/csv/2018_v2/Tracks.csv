  Descending from 5k feet to 1500 was fairly humid, luckily the sun came out and burned through the clouds mid-day.  In the morning I ran across a lady looking for her cellphone that she had dropped and I was luckily able to spot it on the side of the trail and recover it for her.  I think she was slackpacking, since she's at the same hostel I arrived to.  Arrived into town and got a bed at the hostel in a room with raccoon and Dave.  Resupplied for 3 days at the Walmart and should be ready to go in the morning once I go to the post office.  Haven't decided for sure if I will zero or not, been considering it for a while.","Big bald shelter 327

I think I'll continue doing this and keep the goretex away.  I got to the vendeventure shelter (9miles)at noon and spent an hour drying my feet and eating a spare dinner that I had.  This was a great idea to rewarm midday.  Talked with monk about the day. Either go 7 more miles to the next shelter or 14 more to the one after that.  By the time I got to that next shelter (in about 2 and a half hours) I felt pretty good, all of the little injuries that has been bugging me weren't even noticable so I dried out one more time and decided to push on.  The sun came out to play at the hwy 91 crossing so I sat and dried out yet again.  This part was super nice and went through a cool meadow and an active pasture.  By the time I got the double springs it wasu biggest day so far on the AT by 3ish miles.  I was kinda tired.  The shelter was full so I found a (slopey) spot by monk and raccoon ate and went to bed immediately.","Boots off hostel

Saw 3 bears, 2 baby ones and a slightly larger one that must have been mama before the falls.  After the falls met the trail maintenance guy who provided me with an icy drink and an orange.  After he took off an older couple stopped in their car and offered me a ride to town, when I refused (nicely) they instead gave snacks and another soda.  From there it was 4 miles into this shelter.

Once we had taken the bus to town we went to an all you can eat Chinese place next to Walmart and Ingles.  The food wasn't awful and we sure got a lot for our $10.  While there fuego found us via text and came to say goodbye.  It had only been a couple of days since I saw them at Damascus but it felt like a lot longer.  They shared their ice cream with us in the parking lot lol.  Resupplied at Ingles and Walmart and then waited for the 225 bus back to the visitor center.  While waiting I picked up a chicken philly to hike in, fuegos plan from forever ago that I'm not sure he ever did.  Probably boittoi much food cuz my food bag is heavy.  Have about 4 days worth.  Hopefully enough to get into pearrisberg.

But sometimes it feels just fine...
I got to the road gap for Trent's grocery just past a giant suspension bridge that I swam under for a few minutes.  From here it would have need 14 miles to the hostel and it was approximately 1pm. I decided to not go for it and instead hitched a ride to the grocery. Met up with rogue cartographer who had passed me in the morning and a couple others who were waiting for a package.  Had a good burger and tried to resupply snacks and things in the hope that I would be able to get a couple meals at woods hole to skip pearrisberg.  Hung out for a couple hours to charge my phone then got back to the trail.  Ran into the girls from last night planning to go to the shelter (7more miles) so I decided I would too.  Went by dismal falls and some one named frog showed me a spot to jump in from which was awesome.  Had rogue cartographer take a photo of my second jump in then headed up to the shelter.","Campsite 595ish

The trail was super flat and super interesting today.  Went by a bunch of cornfields, and wheat? There were lots of blackberries around as well of which I ate quite a few ripe ones.  There also was a TON of trail runners, probably saw as many today as I have in all the other days on the trail so far.  Hummingbird went by me at around 8, and I met two other hikers a Poppins (with a big red umbrella) and a guy who used to work for Tesla prior to the trail and I can't remember his name.  Three other hikers were at the at trail center but they left right as I arrived so I didn't get their names.  There was a river by the at trail center so I went for a swim before getting back on trail.  It was still super hot, at one point I was just sitting in the shade but could still feel kuaelf just cooking.  I ran into hummingbird right as I decided to skip a shelter for the next water source 2 miles north which was supposed to be a bridge+stream.  My plan was to go into whatever amount of water there was.  Unfortunately that dream was dashed when I arrived to find a bridge over a red mud puddle.  I instead had lunch on the bridge in the shade and was very warm and sad.  After that there was a bit of a hill to climb so luckily there was other water sources.  Passed the 3 hikers from before while climbing the hill and didn't get names again because everyone was very unhappy and sweaty.  Got to hawk rock (doesn't look like a hawk, just like all the Raven rocks) and headed down into town.  I arrived in town at the same time as hummingbird ~4pm so we walked in together.  It was crazy hot.  The heat of the day was magnified by the asphalt so it was awful walking on the road in.  We stopped at the first possible respite (a Sunoco) and crawled in for cold drinks and AC.  The clerk told us to sit in the back in the ac for as long as we wanted.  I resupplied some of my snacks here as the prices were actually pretty good, and looked through my guide book on what to do next.  I hadn't eaten any meals (dinners) from bag since Harper's ferry thanks to all the stores and icecream, and Az had given me his last meal too so I still had 2 dinners.  I decided that I had enough while HB had to resupply.  I also detthat I was going to try and go 56 miles to a hostel that would pick me up from the trail and possibly take me to yuengling brewery on 7-3 I think that's my only shot at the brewery because it's probably closed on the 4th which is when I could have gotten into Port Clinton.  I actually called them and left a reservation saying I'd arrive Tuesday at around 5.

He was on his way to see trail angel Mary and invited me along.  Having no idea and not really wanting to road walk in the heat I went along.  Trail angel Mary is someone that used to live in the campground at the end of town and met hikers for the first time there.  She started feeding them, and as she got jobs and an apartment kept sharing with them.  Pretty cool.  She had 5 backpacks, some that looked familiar, but no hikers.  They were at someone's house in a pool, and luckily that guy just happened to call.  Before I knew it Odie and I were there too and the pool was awesome.  This guy Steve had invited the hikers from the church basement and they had invited their friends that were staying at Mary's.  The only one I knew beforehand was scooter, but pika, jukebox, Houdini, newt,and safety Steve all seemed pretty cool.  Had some beers, venison steak and played in the pool for a bit.  Eventually we all piled into the hiker yearbook bus to go get ice cream, then drove to the river to stand in it and eat the ice cream.  It was quite wonderful.  Being in the hiker yearbook bus is hilarious, Odie yells at every hiker we pass to get in the bus to join us and most of them do. After all that fun, didn't bother to try to hike out and just slept at the basement in the glorious ac.  Hummingbird had resupplied and was there too, slug was also around and peach showed up late.  Plan was to get up early to do the road walk pre heat and try to get in at least 29 to the shelter so that the 56 to the hostel stays doable.","Boiling springs

Hot day. Left the awesome church basement of duncannon at 545. Did the road walk including a super spider filled bridge, It took 5 min to clean off all the webs. Someone had left snacks by where the trail ascended so i grabbed a builder bar, thanks. The climb was actually quite nice. Felt cooler even at 1k. Didnt botice the heat exactly but was definitely going slower than usual all day. Even hummingbird seemed a lot slower than her usual self the couple times that i saw her. Met a sobo section hiking xouple at the first shelter that told me thru jad seen forty nobos in the last 2 days. However i didnit run into many of them. Met 3 (beats handstand and i forgot the third) by the river where i went swimming and then 2 others at the rousch gap shelter, 29 miles out of town. So it wss a pretty quiet day. Paat the river it aeemed almost like it had rained, the trail was soaking wet, very muddy in spots and all the rocks were wet and slippery, but none of the plants looked wet in the slightest. So odd. Got into the shelter just about 720p met two guys that had been at Steve's place yesterday and left to hike out immediately before i arrived. Seemed cool enough.","Duncannon pa

Tracks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596163,"So sunday's air-conditioning in gas station lounge fueled idea to get to PA 183 in 2 days came back to haunt me a little today.  After cranking out 29 miles in the brutal heat yesterday I still had to do about 27 today before 5pm.  This wasn't going to be that easy.  I got up had breakfast and hit the trail right at 6, took a little longer than the days before since I had retrieve a bear hang and eat oatmeal.  The trail right but the shelter was really nice with lots of greenery and then suddenly a huge freaking water source (not marked in the guide) over and including the trail.  Turns out that some industrious beavers had made some dams and flooded this whole part of the trail.  I switched to my camp sandals and forded the trail, which was knee deep in sections.  After the wet excitement, the trail was basically normal, one small hill then another river crossing, on a sweet olden timey metal bridge from then 1800s.  Then the trail passed under a big interstate before climbing to a ridge and staying there for a while.  The two hikers from the shelter (Walkman and brew) passed me in the morning and I met up with them again under the interstate, where some kind soul had left a cooler full of sodas.  I had a mellow yellow for the caffeine and headed up the climb.  The climb was real nice gentle trail, but afterwards it was interspersed with tons of crazy rock sections (as in the photo).  It went back and forth from nice soft trail to rough rock most of the morning until I got to the shelter 13 miles from where I had started.  Here I saw brew and Walkman go to the shelter while I went the other way to the spring.  I filled up on water and had a brief shoes off lunch break. It was just about noon when I left, I had approx 13 miles to the road where I would get my shuttle ride and about 5 hours to make it.  I ate my last caffeinated Clif bar, and prepared to use 2 gels as well.  I started off pretty good, the heat wasn't as bad as the day before but was still noticeable.  Hit a road crossing 2.8 m from the shelter in about 45m, then proceeded apace for a while.  I ran into a south bound section hiker and a dad and 4 sons whom both mentioned an incredible swimming hole.  This wasn't listed in the guide that I had so was news to me.  However I just kept going.  Eventually I got to a rock labelled 'swimming hole' with an arrow, but I couldn't see the water and I wasn't sure exactly how far I was so I just skipped it.  This really sucked.  I love going to and jumping into any sort of even crap swimming hole, so to skip one so highly recommended hurt my soul.  I made it to the marker for some monument the .3m away marker the hostel guy had told me to call from so I made the call then headed to the road.  I had made it by 440, turns out I might have had some time to jump into that swimming hole, but who knows. The guide was kind of crappy for that whole little bit (1190-1205) but it's generally been ok so I can't fault it too much.  The hostel (rock and sole) had been in business for 3 years and was awesome! It was a bunkhouse in a converted garage and everything was really nice and cool.  There were 2 others for a total of 3 hikers.  The outdoor shower was great and it was really nice to get laundry as well, the host also took us to Dollar general to resupply and a beer store.  The dinner, rides and breakfast being included too for $40 made the whole thing kind of a bargain in comparison to some of the other places I'd been to.  Dinner was a really good pulled pork with steamed vegetables and potatoes, I resupplied poorly yet again (not enough bars or similar: pocket food), but I think I'll survive the 90m to Delaware water gap, especially since I'm pretty sure I'm stopping in Port Clinton tomorrow and possibly at wind gap too.","Rousch gap shelter

The really thick cloud cover stopped any views from the cobble.  Was not able to see the whole of Mt greylock.  
In Cheshire I had a lot of stuff to do, needed to resupply, pickup my new phone from the PO, backup my old phone and send it out, and wait for my new shoes at the church.  Luckily the timing worked out really well.  The shoes arrived within an hour of my arrival at the church.  I was afraid I'd have to wait all day or even overnight for them.  After that caught a ride with the nice volunteer lady at the church to Dollar general to resupply.  Tried using the wifi from Dunkin donuts but it wasnt fasult enough to backup all the photos from my s9, so instead of mailing it to Samsung, im still carrying it. Not too bad though, got out of town in only a couple hours.  
The climb up to greylock was fairly wet, at points the path was basically a stream.  It was also incredibly foggy.  I hiked for a bit with 007 until I took a break, and then chaco came past me as well.  Got to the summit around 4 where it was so foggy that I could barely see the tower.  Still chaco and I went up to the view room, but there was no views at all.  
Decided to stay at the lodge to take a shower and stay warm and dry in the supposedly big overnight storm.  Stayed with kstar, 007 and 2 section hikers I had met at upper goose.  Was a pleasant evening.  We even got to attend a talk someone gave about the importance of Massachusetts forests and preserving them.","1569.8 Dalton ma

Tracks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601062,"Started up the Bigelows, the last big mountains until kathadin after 930.  Took our time making a group breakfast at the hostel before heading out.  Had lots of fun there, another hiker sailaway was a wonderful pianist, and the caretaker, trout was a great dude.  Trout had hiked last year and was super helpful, even managing to clean all the gross mold out of my drinking tube.  
Swam in the pond between the summits.  Lots of really nice views from all 3 or 4 summits we went to today.  
Trout had been talking about meeting us at the road ~17 miles out of Stratton with trail magic and he delivered.  He brought Irish car bombs (which 3 of our group had never before had) and sailaway came by as well (slackpacking).  It was a really fun night.  He said he's going to name room2 of the motel for us, which sounds awesome.  
 We camped in a campsite directly by the road he met us (and picked sailaway up from).  It's supposed to rain at night and all day tomorrow so we're buttoned up pretty good.
We have 18 miles until the big River that needs a boat crossing, and the ferry stops running at 2pm.  Our plan for now is to try to crush the miles before 2 then go to a brewery (trout recommended, with a Jacuzzi) on the other side, but we'll see.  18 miles is a lot for before 2, even if the terrain looks easy.","2002.7 ME 27 (paved), Stratton, ME (5.0W)

Tracks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601389,"Had to do a little under 40 miles into town in two days So kinda took it easy.  Took the 1130 shuttle instead of the 930 so we could relax inside a little more.  I kinda had all my stuff loose and ended up leaving my hat in the shuttle after being dropped off.  Seriously lucky though, a couple showed up immediately and talked to us, they had been in the Norwich trail angel list but moved to Maine.  They were kind enough to drive me back to northern outdoors to retrieve it.  That could have been a rough time but it ended up only being a 20m delay.  
The hiking was mellow, sat with turkey and Bryce at pleasant pond for about an hour on the dock.  Then we headed up the hill.  Took my time going up over pleasant pond mountain and moxie bald mountain.  The sun started setting as Bryce and I were climbing moxie bald so we got lots of pictures of the sun setting over Maine with the big river in the background.  
We had been slow, so were way behind silverback, FedEx and turkey, so we decided to try to catch up with the others instead of camping on the summit.  We had dinner near the summit and then started descending with headlamps.  The descent was the hardest part of the day and all the bogs and stuff were there.  
we made it down slowly and arrived to the shelter to find that strawberry and stretch had caught up to us( we'd all planned to be in monson together).  There was also a party of trail workers so I chatted for them by a bit next to their fire.  
Cowboy camped for the first time in a while because the weather forecast was nice.","2039.7 US 201, caratunk
