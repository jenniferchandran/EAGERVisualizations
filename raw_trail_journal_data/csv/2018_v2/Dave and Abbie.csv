Dave and Abbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557287,I have thru-hiked the AT in 2000 and I will try it again in 2018. I look forward to be on the AT and it will be interesting to see how the trail and the people have changed. ,,View Entry,"Mar 22, Wed",0
Dave and Abbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557286,"I am planning on starting my thru hike around the end of February to give me plenty of time to finish and beat the crowds, but now late March is looking better. I would rather be hiking with spring than old man winter.",,View Entry,"Mar 23, Thu",0
Dave and Abbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557300,"In 2000, I hiked with my dog Delilah. Of course Sampson was bestowed upon me by my fellow hikers. She was a Alaskan Malamute and weighed about 140 lbs. Unfortunately, she hated carrying her pack so I was more often stuck with it. She was a great hiking companion and made the trip more memorable; if not more aggravating at times. I will hiking with a dog this year also. Her name is Abbie and is a Border Collie/Australian Shepard mix. Very smart but also very neurotic. We have traveled all over the United States managing National Forest campgrounds so she is well acquainted in being out in the woods.",,View Entry,"Mar 23, Thu",0
Dave and Abbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569225,"I am currently working in Louisiana which has limited hiking opportunities. It also very hot and humid here.  A couple of weeks ago I found a trail called Eagle Loop Trail in Arkansas. It is about 27 miles long and it seemed like a good trail to tryout some of my  new hiking equipment.  It was a great hike and I highly recommend it, although the best times to hike it would be in the spring on fall because of the heat. There was plenty of water sources and you have to cross a river several times. There were seven climbs that totaled about five thousand feet of climbing. The trail is white blazed like the AT, but every side trail or spur is also was white blazed, so I kept on going down the wrong trail which was very aggravating and which added another three miles to the hike. Unfortunately, it seemed like I was the only hiker getting lost. 
 I tried out my new tent which is a Nemo Hornet. I've always used a tarp which are extremely lightweight, but tarps aren't very stable or keeping out insects. The Nemo only weighs around 2 lbs and set up is very simple. It is a two person tent but it would hardly fit me and Abbie. I also tried out my new pack- Gossamer Gear Gorilla. It also weighs around 2 lbs. It did the job, but for 250 bucks it seemed expensive for a pack. My last pack cost me seventy dollars and I put at least 4000 miles on it. 
Abbie did ""okay"". She didn't like carrying her pack even though it didn't weigh more than a pound. She never ran off and mostly walked behind me. We hiked thirty miles miles in two days. It was hot (around ninety), and very humid. To be honest, by the time we got back to the car, I was seriously reconsidering hiking the AT next year. I was exhausted from lack of sleep, the heat, and the bugs. Although my foot and ankle which I've had major surgery and problems with in the past; did great. A few days back at home and my mood has changed more positively  and I'm literally counting the days before I stand on top of Springer Mountain.",,View Entry,"Jun 19, Mon",0
Dave and Abbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578512,"   I'm still in Louisiana and hopefully fall will bring some cooler temperatures so I can do some hiking.  It has been in the nineties for the last couple of days. I feel trapped by the heat. By the time it cools down, I will in Kentucky. There are some good hiking trails where I'm going which will enable to try out my new gear. 
   I made reservations for a one-way rental car from Oklahoma City to Gainesville, Georgia. It was only 175.00 which is very inexpensive for a two day, one-way car rental. I will just need a shuttle to Springer Mountain and I plan on starting on the 19th of February. I was vacillating on a start date between Feb and the latter part of March. I've decided on Feb for several reasons: 1. I want to be in front of the hiking bubble. I don't want to be stressed in trying to find a hotel or hostel, made all more difficult with hiking with a dog. 2. The heat. I've hiked in the heat and I hated it. Abbie, with her dark thick coat and plumpness also doesn't have particular fondness with hot weather.  At least when it is cold, you can put on more layers or keep hiking to stay warm, but when it is hot, there isn't anything to do short of jumping into a lake. Plus, there are the bugs. I know, eventually summer will come but I will be up north where it isn't so bad; I'm hoping. I've started around the end of Feb. once and I encountered a couple of snow storms and low temps, but I am better prepared this time around. 3. No time constraints. With my early start date I have plenty of time to make it to Katahdin before it shuts down; at least seven months. I can almost break a leg and still finish. Knock on wood. 
     I am very excited that in a few months I will be on the AT. I also enjoy reading about the other hikers who will be hiking and wish them good luck on their adventure. ",,View Entry,"Sep 25, Mon",0
Dave and Abbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583091,"I pushed back my start date back a week. I had a bout with the flu and the weather forecast called for rain for most of the week. Looking at the Helen weather forecast for the next few weeks it shows very moderate temperatures. The dog will be happy since I had her shaved.  I can tolerate the rain, it’s the snow and ice that makes hiking difficult and treacherous. Of course, snow and very cold temperatures could happen all the way until May. I was once stuck in a blizzard on Mt Rogers around the middle of April.  I am still sorting out my mail drops and getting my pack ready. I will be renting a car in Dallas and driving to Gainesville Georgia. For a one-way, two-day rental only cost me a total of 150 bucks, which is very reasonable. I still need to find a shuttle from Gainesville to the top of Springer. Everything is coming together very nicely and I can’t wait to be on the trail. ",,View Entry,"Feb 19, Mon",0
Dave and Abbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583362,"I got a ride with Ron from Gainesville to to Springer. Arrived at noon. The rain had stopped, but it was foggy and the temps were in the fifties. The was in excellent condition and there weren't any blow downs Made it to Hawk MTN shelter around four. There's about 8 tenters and a couple of people inside the shelter. A great day to hike. ","Springer Mtn

Dave and Abbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583406,"The weather today was excellent and we hiked under bright azure skies. The temp in morning was around forty and then level off to the mid fifties. My knee was bothering me going downhill but then it suddenly dissipated. Abbie seemed to enjoy herself more today, probably because I carried her pack on the last half. She is completely tuckered out right now. I will be in Neel's gap tomorrow.","Hawk Mtn

Dave and Abbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583467,"The rain came in around four in the morning. It was mostly a drizzle. I had a leak in my tent that I will have to check out. My tent is a Nemo Hornet and weighs around two pounds which means it is out of very fragile materials. I already have a couple of smalls holes in it.We left around eight and the trail was slippery and was sock in with fog. The forest was davasted by hurricane Irma with lots of toppled trees which gave it a dystopian effect. However the trail was cleared. The trail maintainers deserve lots of praise. In the wilderness areas they had to use crosscut saws. The climb up Blood Mountain was brutal and were soaked and cold. Everytime I tried to take a break, Abbie would whine. Finally near the top I found a outcropping and by laying flat on the ground we were able to get out of the rain for a few minutes. It was enough to get my core temperature up a few degrees. The old shelter on top felt like a freezer with it missing doors and windows. The trail going down was worst than the climb up. The trail turned into a small stream. I never fell but I did pinwheel a few times to keep my balance. Made it to Neels gap. I only saw two hikers the whole day. I really needed to get Abbie and me somewhere warm. The hostel didn't allowed dogs so we got a shuttle into Blairsville where we got a room and a pizza. I have a blister on my big toe but other than that I feel fine. Abbie is out like a light.","Woody Gap
",Neels Gap,"Feb 28, Wed",11
Dave and Abbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583505,Took a zero day. Washed my clothes and cleaned my gear. More importantly I got some rest. Blairsville is a nice small bucolic town . I  am staying at The Seasons Inn which is located by the town's square. I'm ready to get back on the trail.  I'm going to try and keep my mileage under ten miles for the next thee days. I want to enjoy myself and not make my hike make my hike into a forced march. When I get into shape I will be able to put in more mileage. ,"

Dave and Abbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583703,A long day. It was a harder climb up Blue Mtn than expected. Heard there was trail magic at Unicoi but when I arrived they were packing up. Abbie got some snacks. I was wanting to make it to cheese farm campsite but ran out of steam so I found a site by a stream. Abbie kept me up  by growling at something prowling around the perimeter of the campsite. If it was a real threat she would have hid in the tent.,"Low Gap

Dave and Abbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583704,It was nice sunny day. The trail up Tray Mtn wasnt as bad as I remembered. Several hikers were napping in the shelter. I felt the pull to stay at the shelter but I pushed on. Found a camping spot about six miles from Dicks gap. Slept well but it was a cold night. ,"Stealth

There was one other tenter who's trail name is RC. The gap was like a wind tunnel and it was hard setting up my tent. I don't know how cold it got but it had to be below twenty. ,"Dicks Gap

Dave and Abbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583954,"The hike up Albert Mountain was steep but had some excellent views at top. The climb was actually easier than what I remembered. Made it to rock gap. Had called Gooder hostel earlier and made arrangements for a shuttle. Zen, the owner was almost a hour late. We were ticked off since he kept calling he was on the way when obviously he wasn't. The hostel was okay. I reserved a Pvt room and got a storage room for 45 bucks. The bunks were twenty which was a good value. ","
