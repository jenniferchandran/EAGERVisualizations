Since I live within an hour of much of the AT as it runs through NY and CT, I thought I would train for my Appalachian Trail through-hike ... by hiking the Appalachian Trail. Joining me today in rather brisk conditions are my loyal NYC hiking companions Diana and Al. Deep snow but fortunately light winds made for a challenging day.

First day down! 

Bitterly cold weather combined with deep unbroken snow meant that I was making the easy portion of the trail much more difficult.

We hiked the approach trail to the trail starting point, then back to the parking area where he said good bye, and my official through hike began. I managed to tear a tarsal ligament in my foot last weekend, and the foot was pretty sore for the first few miles. The hike followed a fairly large creek for the first few miles, with a beautiful rhododendron forest along the trail on both sides. I felt like I was exploring an exotic foreign land. I saw a few through hikers of widely varying levels of fitness and preparation, and took hope in the fact that the race is not necessarily won by the swiftest. Lots of dayhikers as well -- many Koreans just like on the trails at home. The trail left the first drainage and climbed a few big hills -- land around here is high country separated by steep gaps.

Today's hike was a good mixture of creekside trails and steep hillclimbs and descents. Many of the trails ran through rhododendron forests, which should be especially beautiful when they bloom.

I had a great time hanging out at the NOC with my fellow hiking colleagues discussing hiking strategies and tactics. Most of them were going to take zeros today because of the inclement weather forecast. I got up early with my bunkmates who were heading out today and was on the trail by 6:20am. The weather started out warm and muggy but soon turned to a cold driving rain with high winds. I felt like I was hiking in a cloud much of the morning. I had to climb about four thousand feet to get to the first shelter, but I got there about 10:30am which was way too early to end the day. The rain abated for awhile, and I ended up hiking in the rain and thunder to the Brown Fork Gap shelter. Tomorrow I am planning to hike to Fontana Dam -- the southern entrance to the Great Smoky NP, and will probably take a zero before starting in the park. Temperatures are dropping and the wind is picking up -- the forecast is calling for a light dusting of snow later tonight.

""If you're going to be dumb, you've got to be tough""
I packed up my gear in the dark at the hostel because I was going to get an early start, and some of the people were going to take zero days. The owner's son drove me and another hiker the mile to the trailhead, and along the way we joked about all the gear that gets left behind inadvertently. After getting dropped off and hiking a few hundred yards I did a mental inventory and realized that I had not packed my raincoat. I cached my pack, ran back to the hostel, found my raincoat and ran back to the trailhead. I'm sure that there's a great investment opportunity in outdoor gear at the pace at which I seem to be losing it.
The morning was cold and foggy, and the trail was runny mud. We had a few long climbs, and then we reached an area of metamorphic limestone, and the trail got very steep and rocky. Much of the midday hiking reminded me of the trails in New Hampshire. We passed the three-hundred mile mark shortly after this section, and finally the sun came out after what seems like a week of rain, and things started to dry out. We passed through a few balds: areas on the tops of mountains cleared in the last century for grazing, and then it was time to find a campsite for the evening.

The two words for today were ""hot"" and ""up"". Remember me complaining about the rain and the cold? Yes, me neither. The leaves on the trees are still budding, so there was little respite from the sun today, although the route up from the river was especially beautiful, as it followed several tributaries that had abundant waterfalls. Eventually we gained about four thousand feet of elevation, and the temperatures dropped a bit. I ran into a few hikers I have been leapfrogging for the several hundred miles, and it was fun comparing experiences both on the trail and in towns during zeros.","Nolichucky River, Erwin TN, mile 343.8

Started the day early because of heat concerns regarding the climb up Roan Mountain. Heard an animal grunting in the rhododendron bushes just downhill from my tent around 5am. Deer? Bear? Unfortunately it was too dark to get a view. The hiking in the morning was tough, but the approach to the peak was from the north, so much of climb was in shadow. Beautiful views at the top. Ran into Handstand, whom I met at the NOC a few weeks ago -- we joked that we had matching hiking outfits -- and later he mentioned that his mother, also trailnamed Handstand, successfully through hiked about 30 years ago. At Carvers Gap there was trail magic in the form of hot dogs, chips and desserts. One of the people putting it on makes knives as a post-retirement hobby, and he had one to show that looked very professional. After that it was a hot slog over some of the balds -- hilltops that had been cleared many years ago for summer stock grazing -- and finally to one of the most unique shelters on the AT -- a two-story barn with sleeping areas on both levels. Unfortunately my allergies are so bad that I have to tent-camp because of my night coughing. Was hoping to get a room in Roan Mtn TN tomorrow but they are having a hiking festival and everything is booked up.
And finally, happy anniversary to me: today marks my one-month milestone on the trail!","stealth campsite on Little Rock Knob, mile 371.2

Imminent thunderstorms all day failed to materialize thankfully, and it was hot and cloudy from the shelter down to the highway and the town of Roan Mountain. Thankfully as well I was able to get cell service, and booked a room in the overflow house for a local B&B. The route down today was quite beautiful: we went over several balds that reminded me of Santa Cruz Island of the Channel Islands NP, and then down some steep sections of metamorphic sandstone that reminded me of the Catskills, when the land was submerged under a deep ocean near the equator about 370 million years ago. Glad I was descending the steep gradient, and not ascending like the Boy Scout troop I passed.""Donny, mark it a zero."": After traversing the NC/TN border for the last few hundred miles, we finally said goodbye to NC this afternoon, and are now firmly committed to TN for the next week or so.

Still having allergy issues which is making the hike all the more arduous. Much of the morning was spent hiking through some bald mountain tops, and then in the afternoon we dropped down along the Laurel River, which has some incredible waterfalls and rapids. It must be fun to do some river rafting through this region. The rest of the day was spent in the long green rhododendron tunnel, with very few views. Apparently much of Virginia is similar, and a lot of hikers drop out there from boredom. I found a stealth campsite just before the shelter, just as the rain began to fall.

The day started with rain but it ended by the time I had to pack my tent. The morning was a series of short but steep climbs and descents, until I came to a beautiful river that dropped down through a pasture and past an ancient barn, and finally out to a road. There were signs for hostels, and the elderly woman section hiker who I had been leapfrogging and I decided to go to the westerly, slightly closer one, she for a room for the night and me for a diet soda. That hostel is famous for being a donation-only business, and bless him for opening his house to hikers, but it was seriously creepy, and let's not start in on utter dearth of diet sodas. We hitchhiked to the second one (Black Bear Resort) which was amazing in comparison. A lesser man would have called it a short day and booked a room, but I was not that man today; a lesser man would have had heart palpitations from the amount of caffeinated soda I inhaled in very short time, but I was not that man today either. I soon headed back to the trail, and after a short hike came to very large volcanic rock cliffs. After a very steep descent (I am thinking of you New Hampshire) I came to an incredible waterfall. Think of a corporate reception or high-end restaurant waterwork made vastly larger, with massive amounts of water flowing through it. While viewing it I ran into a bunch of people I hadn't seen for a while. One group was a family that started the AT together -- that experiment failed quickly -- but now support the father's hike via the family van command module. I remembered them from Spivey Gap, where they were giving out Taco Bell as trail magic. I thanked them profusely for their generosity, and casually asked if they had any leftovers. When they said no, it took all my discipline to not start rummaging through their packs and purses just to make certain.
After that the trail followed the river and its rapids for several miles until the trail split and headed up. Seriously up. Hot day, no shade, no wind made for a very difficult climb. The fact that I saw a number of slackpackers on the trail climb meant that I should be paying attention to elevation profiles and hostel proximity much more closely than previously.
Nonetheless almost a perfect day, and I will be posting pictures of it when I get a wifi connection.","stealth campsite, mile 412

When I woke up there were high winds and gray roiling skies, so I snapped into action: I rolled over and went back to sleep. Once I got going the trail wound down the backside of the mountain I had climbed the previous day, eventually reaching Watauga Lake (protip: the natives pronounce it wah-TOO-ga). There was a hostel there with ice cream and diet sodas, and fortunately I had the willpower to pass on the room and the potential slackpack. At the lake, there was a couple handing out trail magic: he had done the trail last year, and had a lot of great information and anecdotes to share, perhaps to make up for the lack of diet sodas. I mentioned that I was getting off the trail next month to watch my daughter compete in a half ironman, and he got really interested in that, and asked a lot of questions. Just as I was gathering up my gear he mentioned that he competed in the very first ironman competition in Hawaii in the early eighties. Any yokel with time and patience can hike the Appalachian Trail; very few people can cover 140 miles at competition speed. I was most impressed.
Today's hike took us around and far above the lake, which was part of the TVA project of the 1940s. The lake has many fingers, and it was beautiful to get various views of it. Bears are a big problem near the lake, and I saw more bear skat in the 5 miles near the lake than I saw on the rest of my trip thus far. I got to the Vandeventer shelter late in the day -- it is on a beautiful bluff overlooking the lake, but pressed on a bit to find a campsite.

The AT gods decided to tease me a bit this morning: I had good cell service at my campsite last night, so I lingered in bed for a bit checking hockey scores and the latest Trump shenanigans, and just before packing up the rain started coming down hard. I packed up my gear and the wet tent, hiked about a hundred yards and the rain stopped. In fact it didn't rain anymore all day, even as big thunderheads were building in the distance.
Today was the typical hiking, although the temperatures are beginning to make it much more strenuous. We hiked through the one mile section set up for handicapped hikers, and I could have used an assisted walker in the heat. We also hiked through some pastureland, and there was a large flock of tanagers having a frolicsome playdate along the fence rows. So beautiful!","stealth campsite past Vandeventer shelter, mile 438

Along the way I saw quite a few of my fellow northbounders, several of whom I had not seen in several hundred miles, and it seemed at times like a ten-year high school reunion.

Heavy rain last evening along with bear warning made me opt for sleeping in the shelter. The shelter had two floors, and I must have selected the floor for the heavy snorers. We spotted a bear in the distance around dusk, and then heard some serious noises around midnight. Slept soundly knowing that they would probably not be able to climb up the shelter ladder without detection.
Today started out rainy and gray, then turned hot and sunny, then heavy rains moved in in the late afternoon. Grayson Highlands is a remarkably beautiful area, with extensive formation's of volcanic rock. Much of it reminded me of New Hampshire, and with the clouds hugging the hills, Iceland. Definitely one of the prettiest areas on the trail so far.
Just after the Highlands was ... trail magic, courtesy of two brothers who have been spending time in the area camping for over fifty years. They provided quite a bit of history of the area, as well as several diet sodas. Yum!
After a few more miles we came upon ... more trail magic, this time courtesy of a through hiker from last year. Cheeseburger, chips, and fruit made up for the dearth of diet sodas.

Last night just after I set up my tent we got a huge thunderstorm, and some of the people I had leapfrogged passed me in the deluge praising my tent site choice.
Today was a very difficult day. I had a big climb that required a lot of scrambling up to the Dragon's Tooth formation -- always difficult when carrying a top heavy backpack weighing 30+lbs. The formation was very interesting: it was large sheets of limestone that had been twisted vertically and had an angle of about 80 degrees. The climb required a lot of awkward hand and foot holds, and there was a significant dropoff. After that came the real horror: hiking down the AT on these striated layers thst had been shifted to about a 45 degree angle in each direction, and a cliff about 60 feet high. I passed two women who said that they were nurses, and that they could help if I plunged over the side. I wondered if they were freelancing on their day off. After a while things moderated, and finally at the bottom of the mountain there was a store with ice cream and diet sodas on a very hot day.

I am back on the trail after an almost two-week trail vacation. I had a great time visiting my daughter Annie in Chicago -- time well-spent after two months trudging through the south.
The current plan is to continue north from where I had left off with the winter snowshoeing, and then finish the remaining southern portion when I am done with Maine. To that end, my friend Brian drove me up to Lime Rock, CT this morning, and hiked the first portion of the trail before turning back. He was going to convey some trail magic that we picked up enroute before heading back home. Truly a magician indeed.
Today was hot and tiring -- it's hard to believe that I could have gotten so far out of shape after only a brief layoff, but the hills seemed larger than I had remembered them from previous outings. The route today eas quite beautiful -- first along the Housatonic River, with several very impressive waterfalls, and then up a long ridgeline with beautiful views of the valleys to the east. The weather unfortunately is supposed to get extremely hot over the next few days -- should make the hiking that more challenging.

Yesterday's early hiking conclusion brought me via a very generous ride offer to the East Mountain Retreat Center, a very comfortable place to rest up for the day. The center is run by an elderly minister, and allows hikers a living room, bathroom and separate sleeping area for a very nominal donation. No wifi or diet sodas, but everything else was perfect. And, since I was the only hiker there yesterday, I had the run of the place to myself. Tragically, I had to hike the 1.5 miles back to the trailhead this morning -- miles that will never count in the official totals.
Yesterday's blazing heat gave way to very impressive evening thunderstorms, and the weather today was slightly cooler with gusty winds. With the exception of a high school backpacking group (they all called me ""sir"" as they passed me) I only saw the same several hikers I saw yesterday -- the bubble is definitely behind us but closing fast.
Tomorrow I am planning to stay at the world-famous (at least on the trail) Upper Goose Pond shelter, where the shelter custodian makes blueberry pancakes each morning for through hikers, and there are canoes and kayaks for use. Tomorrow will be short on hiking but long on faffing and lollygagging.","MA 23 1530.1

Funny item: I am generally a very lucid dreamer, and on the trail with the fatigue I have been especially so. Last night I had an incredibly lucid dream with an amazing level of detail. The funny thing was I had a dream later in the night where I was explaining the prior dream to the current dream attendees.

My friend Brian was going to do several days of slackpacking in the far western section of the White Mountains of New Hampshire and invited me to join in. He picked me up just north of I-90 in western MA and we drove up to a hostel that gave us a ride to the trailhead. It was a glorious sunshine day with cooler temperatures and a light breeze; the trail had a couple of moderate climbs and descents, and thankfully few mosquitos. We had a delicious Mexican dinner and a stay at a hostel, and will get an early start on tomorrow's hike.
Tomorrow we are scheduled to go over the north and south peaks of Mt Kinsman, which are considered to be much more challenging than the terrain we have covered so far, and the true start of the Whites. Tomorrow will be about a twelve hour hike, with several extremely steep climbs. I am thankful I will be doing it with a light daypack instead of the full backpack. Wish me luck!","Wentworth NH 1782.4

I have been backpacking for about a thousand miles so far, but today's hike made me feel like I had just started. The hike was the most difficult so far, as well as one of the most beautiful. The day started with a long steep climb before leveling off a bit and then a long section of what are generally referred to as ""pointless ups and downs."" Then after a long descent and brief stop at a shelter, we started a long ascent. The first mile was along the Eliza Brook, which had a long series of interlocking rapids and waterfalls, and was a serious temptation to stop and swim. The trail kept getting steeper and steeper, until after passing a mountain pond, became an endless struggle over sharply angled boulders set at an almost vertical gradient. We finally made the two summits and then had a similar long descent. Beautiful day but a very long and tough one as well.","Rte 112 1801.5

The skies darkened all day and I managed to get my tent up just before it started to rain hard. Walking through the dark forest made me think of the Lord of the Rings all afternoon. 
The mosquitos were not active today until they ambushed me in the last hour of my hike. My theory is that the preponderance of Vermont's mosquitos bit me yesterday and were taking a collective zero day today.
I ran into two different northbound flip floppers who were near my age today, and it was fun to compare experiences with them. They both had a lot of questions regarding the section of the White Mountains that I completed with Brian last week. I hope I run into them in Maine later in the trip.
I stopped for ice cream at an upscale market a bit off the trail around noon. They sold items that were probably aimed at affluent Bostonians out for a weekend trip. I enjoyed the ice cream very much (organic; locally produced from locally produced cows) but passed on the maple-flavored cola. I did see a number of sophisticated maple sap harvesting systems along the trail today -- perhaps the demand for maple-flavored cola is greater than I had thought.
I was taking a break at a view spot in the afternoon when a woman passed me on the trail. I recognized her from the Upper Goose Pond shelter from last week. I did the calculations and determined that she was hiking about thirty miles per day in the interim. I was so impressed with her stamina and ambition that I snapped into action: I took a longer break."," stealth campsite south of West Hartford, mile 1738

Temperature forecast for the next week is 90+ degree highs each day-- Vermont seems to be getting the short end of the bargain again, climate-wise. Today was tough hiking, but fortunately the tougher parts were in the morning, when I was fresher and the air was a bit cooler. The latter part of the afternoon's hike was along a beautifully flowing river, and it took quite a bit of self-control to not kick my shoes off and wade in the water for awhile. Or forever. Tomorrow we hike past Clarendon Gorge, and I plan to spend some time soaking in the pools there.
I took a near-o and a zero in Rutland, and I was sorely tempted to take a second zero today because of the weather. Fortunately there is not much to do in Rutland, so the temptation was minimal. I had to hitchhike back to the trail, which took longer than expected. I guess it's difficult to tell if I am a hiker, or just homeless. I was grateful that the VT state police car merely passed me without stopping to give me a ticket. I did get a ride from someone who had done a number of long-distance trails, and it was fun to compare experiences.
The AT runs along the same route as the VT Long Trail for the next one hundred miles, and I had some fun trying to see if I could guess the LT hikers versus the AT hikers -- the latter group look like they have been hiking for a thousand years.","Rutland VT, mile 1701.9

Happy Fourth of July! There will be plenty of celebrating today, and not just because it is my three month anniversary on the trail! Hard to remember what those first few days were like, now that I am grizzled veteran of the trail. I do look fondly back to those days without insect swarms.
Today's hike took us up and over Bromley Mountain, where there is a ski resort at the top. The ski patrol keeps a warming hut open for hikers, and it was great to spend the lunch hour inside a cool, insectless building. I even tried out the stationary chairlift to see if  I could conjure up a cold winter's day. The rest of the day was spent slogging up steep hills in thousand degree heat -- thankfully there was sufficient water in the streams to keep me hydrated.
I saw a few hikers today who were with me at Upper Goose Pond last week. Sadly I heard that one of the women who was there and with whom I hiked portions of several days previously has called it quits due to recurring foot issues. Apparently she had tried seven different pairs of hiking shoes in an attempt to solve the problem; she probably has enough shoes now to get a head start on opening a hiker store.","stealth campsite, mile 1663

Today's hike took us past Stratton Pond -- I dipped my feet in before the bugs drove me off -- and up over Stratton Mountain.

Along the way I saw many dayhikers: they smelled so fresh and had such an abundance of energy. At the top of the mountain there is a war monument and a very elegant lodge. I stopped in for lunch and had a very delicious hamburger, but passed on the bunkhouse lodging opportunity. After lunch I headed down the opposite slope and went several miles to a shelter to set up my tent. I am headed to Lee MA (a thirty five mile value!) where I am meeting some friends on Saturday to head up to Maine for a week of slackpacking, and I don't have to go very far each day in the interim to get there by then; hence the short day today.

For the second night in a row I heard a bear run through the campsite -- both nights' sites had metal bearboxes for the hiker food; I suspect that the bears were just checking on hiker diligence in food storage.
Today was a long slog through uninspiring landscapes: few views, no rivers, and the two towns that the trail runs through don't seem to put out much effort in accommodating hikers. In the south the trail towns are much more active; I guess by the time the hikers have come this far north everyone's enthusiasm has been ground down a bit.

The plan was to complete the portion of the trail from just south of the Mahoosuc Notch to the Carlo Col shelter. In order to complete that, we had to complete a complicated car shuttle via rutted gravel roads and hike trails to and from the AT. The trails through this area of Maine are very steep, with long sections of tilted granite sheets. I had done a section of today's hike last year, and was grateful that I knew what sorts of terrain I would be encountering today.

We camped at the Success Pond trailhead and after a quick doughnut breakfast got an early start on a very long hiking day. First stop was the Mahoosuc Notch, a mile-long segment over, around and under a long collection of boulders. Fun stuff if you are up for rock scrambling, which fortunately we were. Next up was the Mahoosuc Arm, a fifteen hundred foot climb up a very steep hill. After that we passed Speck Pond, a beautiful backcountry lake, and then up and over Old Speck Mountain, with a steep climb up a long series of tilted granite slabs. Along the way leapfrogged a family of eight -- seven hikers, most of whom were under twelve, plus one infant in a papoose -- through hikers who were close to finishing the trail. A family vacation with a family that size is a challenge; a through hike with a group like that must be a terrific ordeal.

Sunny skies and warm temperatures in the morning today brought out the black flies, but the skies soon darkened and the rain started anew. Got trail magic at the parking area from a former through hiker, and then yogied a ride from some very generous Irish visitors who drove out of their way to drop me at the center. The Highland Center reminds me of an upscale college dormitory: bunkbeds, cafeteria, etc. I hope my eventual roommate will be tolerant of my trail aroma.
In honor of next year's fiftieth anniversary of the first moon landing, I will be sharing some of  my knowledge of trivia regarding that mission... 
When the lunar module landed on the moon, the fuel gauge indicated less than thirty seconds of fuel remained in the tank, and there were constant warnings regarding that while Neil Armstrong was diligently trying to find a suitable landing spot. If he had exceeded that time he would have been forced to abort the mission.","Zealand Falls Hut, mile 1837.7

Today was a very hard day. I started at the AMC Highland Center, where I spent the night last night. I got a ride to the trailhead and started the climb, which was about 4000 feet for the day. The first interesting spot was the Webster Cliffs, a long series of cliffs that overlook the Crawford Notch from about 3000 feet. There was some clearing, so the views were pretty good. The Cliffs involve a series of short but very steep climbs which were challenging. The rain started around then, and it became progressively heavier as the day wore on. The second part of the day involved more climbing through tundra areas, and the wind picked up to serious gusts, fog and slashing rain. The trail rivers from yesterday turned into cascading torrents, and the water started to accumulate into pond-sized puddles. I was joyed to see the hut finally poke through the fog and wind. Tomorrow is the hike up and over Mt Washington, which might make today's hike look like an easy stroll.
More Apollo 11 trivia: Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin practiced their moon landing via simulator hundreds of times, to test reaction to various problems they might encounter. Previous missions had made high-resolution photographs of the landing area in the moon's Sea of Tranquility. Armstrong noticed early in the landing that they were one to two seconds ahead of where they were supposed to land, which would send them into a boulder-ridden area.","Crawford Notch, mile 1845.5

At dinnertime last night the massive thunderstorm finally passed through and we were treated to a beautiful sunset, with the sunshine pouring through the remaining layers of clouds. The crew at the hut did a humorous incantation because the sun hadn't appeared for the previous week. Today's hike was completely in the alpine region above treeline, and we started the hike up to Mt Washington in brilliant sunshine and warm temperatures. The summit area was cold and windy, but there was a hut with a restaurant and I took some time to warm up and consume a diet soda. At breakfast this morning one of the crew read the daily weather forecast, and the phrase ""powerful thunderstorms later in the day"" caught my attention. After hiking down from Mt Washington the evidence that the storms were forming became very apparent. The trail was very rocky, and it was difficult for me to generate much speed on the trail. The rain started falling in earnest in the last mile, and the lightning became localized just when I reached the hut. I joked with a fellow hiker that I had nothing to worry about because people rarely got hit by lightning, and it was even rarer for someone to get hit on his birthday.
Today's Apollo 11 trivia: While Neil Armstrong was diligently working to find a landing area, program alarms started going off, with the codes 1201 and 1202. In their simulator training the team had never encountered these codes before, and there was considerable concern that the mission would have to be aborted with fewer than three minutes to landing. --More on this tomorrow--","Lakes of the Clouds hut 1856.5

Beautiful evening at the Madison Spring Hut after the thunderstorms rolled through. Amazing sunset through the clouds as they sang me ""Happy Birthday."" Today we all got up early, had a delicious breakfast and then made our way up and over Mt Madison. The last few days the trail has been above treeline, and the trail was a continuous march over large boulders. Eventually we made our way down below treeline, and the trail crisscrossed a series of rivers for several miles before reaching Pinkham Notch. There is an AMC lodge there, and I able to neutralize the healthy hiking with some ice cream and diet soda. Amy, a long-term section hiker generously offered me a ride to my hostel, where I will stay tonight and get ready for my next section of the trail.
Apollo 11 trivia: During one of Armstrong's and Aldrin's simulated landings, they received an error message that the team didn't understand, and one of the mission supervisors aborted the landing. Gene Krantz, the flight director, exploded in anger because the supervisor did not know the severity of the error, and the error message was just a numerical code. In so many words, he accused the supervisor with flushing a billion dollars of the space budget down the drain. A lower- level employee (Jack Garmin) took it upon myself to collate all of the potential error messages, their meanings and their severity and stored that listing under the glass on his desktop. When the lunar landing encountered the 1201 and 1202 program alarms, he was able to communicate up the management chain their source and severity very quickly, and was able to save the mission from a needless abort.","Madison Spring Hut, mile 1863.7

Notice that spring in my step? That's right, it was brand new shoes day. Regrettably, however, the muddy trail bogs took the sheen off the shoes even before you could say ""Bob's your uncle."" The scenery today was beautiful: lots of ponds and steep rocky crags. I saw a number of through hikers near the Maine border, and each of them told me how excited they were to be reaching their final state. I have two more days in NH in order to finish the White Mountains, and then I will be heading back to Maine to complete the state as well.
Yesterday I had a nice time walking down from Mt Madison to Pinkham Notch, first with a woman who did almost all of the trail with her late husband, and now with her high school-aged son. I also hiked with a college professor who was doing the trail in sections during his summer breaks. It turned out that he used to work with a former girlfriend of mine. Either it's a small world or I have dated a lot of women :)
Apollo 11 trivia, continued: It turned out that the program alarms were due to an unnecessary radar setting: the lunar module had two sets of radar -- one for the lunar landscape and the other for monitoring the command module in case they had to abort the mission. The computer system was set so that all of the processing tasks were supposed to complete within two seconds, but the extra radar monitoring was exceeding that limit, and that what was generating the program alarm. Because Jadk Garmin had collated all of the possible program alarms and their causes, he was able to nullify any possible deleterious consequences that might have occurred otherwise.","Carlo Col, mile 1909.6

Today's hike was over relentlessly challenging terrain, and was one of the most difficult days on the trail for me. The hike involved climbing over a number of mountain peaks in two separate ranges in the White Mountains: The Wildcats and the Carters, separated by a very steep notch and series of ponds. The hike started at Pinkham Notch and climbed steeply over a series of automobile-sized boulders, as well as a series of crevasses. Each peak in the series involved a steep ascent followed by a steeper descent. At the midpoint there was a drop into a notch where there was an AMC lodge, and I went in for awhile to eat lunch. The whole day was spent hiking, until I found a stealth spot up on the top of one of the last peaks in the Carters. My two day trip from Pinkham to Gorham is twenty one miles; a number of people do it in one day -- I suspect they are made out of far more durable materials.","Pinkham Notch, mile 1871.5

Much of the trail followed streams and rivers down, and north side of the mountains was covered in beautiful mossy carpets. Early in the day I saw a juvenile owl, who sat patiently while I snapped a few pictures, even moving to a nearby tree when I got too close.

Another fantastically beautiful day in Maine. I got a shuttle from Gorham NH to Rangeley ME and started in post-haste. The woman who shuttled me through hiked the trail in 2016 with her golden retriever, and she offered a lot of advice and suggestions. She's planning to do the Pacific Crest Trail next year -- some people never learn. In Gorham I stayed at the Rattle River Hostel, which is one of the best hostels on the trail. Clean, well-organized, and efficiently run. 
The route today was up and over three mountains that are above treeline. The first, Saddleback, had a number of false summits, which was quite frustrating. The third, Saddleback Junior, had a very steep ascent, which reminded me of the tortuous climb update the first Wildcat peak. Along the route were several ponds; I didn't see any moose today, but I did see some wild turkeys and a grouse hen with her fledgling chick. Very cute indeed.
Apollo 11 trivia, continued: After Armstrong and Aldrin completed their moonwalk, it was time for them to go to sleep. However, the lunar module did not have space for beds, so they had to sleep on the floor and leaning against the back of the module. Also, there was no heating, and the lunar night was bitterly cold, which made sleep almost impossible.","ME 4, Rangeley ME, mile 1970.5

Another day of steep climbs and descents over rocky and rooted terrain. Rain started to fall just as I got to my camping site; otherwise the weather today varied from sunshine to overcast. The rain is supposed to settle in tonight and linger through tomorrow. I am glad to have gotten today's descents done in dry conditions. Several more days of mountainous terrain before the trail levels out for the final stretch before Katahdin.
Frogs: I saw more frogs today on the trail than all other days combined, from the tiniest spring peepers to one that was so large I initially thought it was a squirrel. Any coincidence that the mosquitoes were not particularly active today?
Apollo 11 trivia, continued: While the mission supervisors could test the rocket engines of the main rocket stages, because the fuel for the ascent engine of the lunar lander was so caustic they could not test that engine prior to the Apollo 11 flight. Neil Armstrong said he thought that the mission had a ninety percent probability of reaching the moon, but only a fifty percent probability of returning safely. NASA had a protocol set up if the lunar module ascent engine failed where they would shut off radio communications before the oxygen levels dropped in the module, and President Nixon had a speech prepared to address the nation in this case.","stealth campsite, mile 1983

A beautiful day and a beautiful trail. Today we climbed three four thousand footers, the last of which we will do on this trip with the exception of Mt Katahdin, and all of which were above treeline with full views of what seemed like all of Maine. The first and last portion of the hike were through moss- covered boulders larger than houses. Unlike the Mahoosuc Notch, we didn't have to go over and under them; the trail wended its way through the narrow gaps. After a stop at a pond-side shelter for lunch, we climbed the three peaks in succession, dropping down into steep cols between. There is a huge lake on the north side of the trail, Flagstaff Lake, and at the tops of the peaks the views out at the lake and beyond were splendid. Tomorrow I hope to finish off the remaining Bigelow mountains and get close to the Kennebec River by Tuesday. Maine has been one of the prettiest states so far; hopefully it will be easier now that the bigger peaks are done.
Apollo 11 trivia, continued: Michael Collins, in the command module orbiting the moon while Armstrong and Aldrin were on the lunar surface, mentioned the overwhelming sensation of being completely alone. Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull wrote a song about it, called "" Michael Collins, Jeffrey and me.""","ME 27, mile 2002.7

The good: Beautiful light, weather and scenery as I headed over Little Bigelow Mountain and then down to Flagstaff Lake, which I had been viewing for the last several days in the mountains. I stopped for a lunchtime skinny dip, and then hiked along the flats and over some climbs to reach some of the other carry ponds. The ponds got their names from when they were used for boat transportation -- the ""carry"" comes from the necessity of portaging them between the ponds. A portion of today's trail followed the route used by Benedict Arnold and his troops as they traveled through Maine in an attempt to surprise the British in Quebec City in 1775, an attack that went poorly after a hellish trip through Maine. Speaking of surprises, there was trail magic at the West Carry Pond Lean-to: fluffernutter sandwiches, moon pies, apples and home made ginger snaps. Very delicious! Also, the sunset at the East Carry Pond this evening was heartbreakingly beautiful.
The bad: The trail markings were poor in some places, and made the trail easy to lose in places. The heat and humidity were stifling, the mosquitos were ravenous, the trail was rocky and rooted, and my pack grew more uncomfortable as the day wore on.
The horrendous: The trail was a mud bog for miles and miles. High water table, insufficient efforts at channeling the runoff, heavy recent rain? Who knows? The mud and water were relentless.","tentsite at Safford Brook, mile 2013.1

Things I hope to remember long after today:
- The loons calling to each other last night at the East Carry Pond. Their calls are the song of plaintive sadness.- Skinny dipping at the pond as the sun set, with only a million midges as an audience.- A beautiful sunrise and clear skies as I hiked out to the Kennebec River.-  A stop for some of the most delicious buckwheat and fruit-filled pancakes I have ever eaten at the Harrison's Pierce Pond Camp, a very rustic hunting & fishing camp near the trail. One of a dying breed of camps that Maine used to have throughout the state.- A beautiful hike along the Pierce Pond Stream, through volcanic rock, and the stream filled with rapids and waterfalls.- A quick but powerful thunderstorm, with the tops of the trees rocking back and forth like Ray Charles at the piano.- A canoe ferry ride across the Kennebec River. Apparently there have been enough hiker drownings that the AMC has for many years hired a ferryman to convey hikers across the water. Life jackets, liability waivers, and detailed instructions were provided.- A hiker hostel in Caratunk that managed to find me a room after turning away others. The pulled pork sandwich and chocolate milkshake they provided were deeply satisfying.
Apollo 11 trivia, continued:Neil Armstrong was NASA's first choice for first man on the moon, partly because of his intelligence and temperament, but also because he was retired from the service, and hence no branch would be able to grab credit for the success of the mission. NASA had grave concerns about Aldrin because of his ability to get along with others; however, Armstrong said that he would be able to work well with Aldrin, and sought to keep him on the team."," East Carry Pond, mile 2029.4

Taking a near-o today and a zero tomorrow in Monson, the last trail town before the hundred mile wilderness and Mt Katahdin. Beautiful weather here today -- seems a shame to be spending it lollygagging and loafing instead of humping the pack up and down yet another hill. I leapfrogged a father and son hiking the trail yesterday who were each wearing the same yellow shirt as mine (fashion-savvy or stalkers looking to blend in?) and each drinking a can of Coke. They said that they bring a six pack each in the trail with them -- truly hikers after Two Liter Peter's heart. They did chuckle when I asked them if they possibly had any extra cans of diet soda with them as well.
The hundred mile wilderness is the next section of the trail; the first portion has very difficult terrain, and the general lack of resupply options means having to carry a vast quantity of food. Some hikers pay for a midpoint food drop, others stop in at a hunting/fishing camp a boat ride away from the trail. This morning I met a couple in the Monson trailhead parking lot who were setting out for the wilderness: the husband was carrying a pack weighing sixty three pounds. I could barely hoist his pack using both hands.","stealth campsite, mile 2071.2

Tougher day than the elevation profile suggested, given the heat, humidity and enormous load of food I am carrying. I climbed a number of mountains today, with names that appeal to a numbers guy like me: Fourth Mountain, Third Mountain, and of course, the all-important Mt Three and a Half. I hope to complete the wilderness in six days, so I am carrying seven days worth of food. The first three days have the most difficult mileage, and tomorrow will most likely be the toughest of the three days; after that the trail levels off quite a bit. Camping at a beautiful pond this evening -- I appear to be the only person within a radius of many miles.
Apollo 11 trivia, continued: Neil Armstrong could barely fit through the lunar module hatch in his fully pressurized space suit at the time of his space walk. In fact, while exiting the craft he broke off the switch that would be used to fire the lunar ascent engine.

I camped last night at the East Chairback Pond, and I was all alone, with the possible exception of the loons that were calling off and on during the night. The pond was covered in a foggy mist this morning, and I wished that I had had the time to linger there for awhile. Today's hike took me through the beautiful Gulf Hagas region, where there is a long side-trail that goes through a narrow canyon carved by a cascading brook. The AT ran along another scenic cascading river as it climbed into an area with several mountains for us to cross. The last few days I have been leapfrogging various people: two women, one a former through hiker, an Italian father-and-son, a younger guy who will be finishing the trail this week. It has been fun to catch up with them periodically during each day and discuss the trail and future plans. Today as well I saw a German man slightly younger than me who I first saw in Hot Springs NC and again in Gorham NH -- fun to get reacquainted with people from what seems like long ago.
Today's route took us over four mountains -- the last four big peaks before the trail settles down a bit and before Katahdin. The last peak, White Cap Peak, is above treeline, and was very foggy and windy. The rain that had threatened us all day started then, and the long descent would have been difficult without the massive work done by the Maine ATC who had engineered steps via carefully placed stones throughout the mountain trails we covered today. I had been griping about the poor trail conditions in Maine previously; however, it was clear today how much effort they have been expending on behalf of the AT.
Apollo 11 trivia, continued: The only deaths in the Apollo program (other than unfortunate incidental plane crashes) occurred in the Apollo 1 mission, where a fire broke out in the capsule during a ground training test. Because nitrogen naturally exists in our bloodstream, and that nitrogen forms bubbles (the bends) when going from lower pressure to higher pressure, the astronauts have to be supplied with pure oxygen for several hours before liftoff in order to reduce their nitrogen levels. The original Apollo design called for pure oxygen to be pumped into the capsule, and the hatch to be inwardly opened. During a test of the capsule on the ground, a spark in the electrical system caused the pure oxygen to ignite in a very hot fire, and the pressurized capsule prevented the astronauts from being able to open the hatch to escape. The accident and deaths of the three astronauts forced NASA to make many very necessary design changes that dramatically increased the safety of the future missions.","East Chairback Pond, mile 2105.0

The loons on the lake seem to be calling ""way to go, Peter! You're looking good!"" Today's route took us over Little Boardman Mountain (Little Bored Man?) and then on a level path along a number of rivers.

Several more days in the wilderness (perhaps not a completely accurate name for the area -- I did see a logging truck and a couple of RVs today!) and then a scheduled climb up Mt Katahdin on Sunday hopefully.
Apollo 11 trivia, continued: Michael Collins's role was to man the command module while Armstrong and Aldrin spent time on the moon. Because he did not have to train as intensively for his role, he was also assigned the task of overseeing the development of the space suits to be worn on the lunar surface. Much development had to be made to make the inner  suits both flexible and air-tight, and in the end there was considerable input from the developers and seamstresses from the Playtex Girdle Company.","stealth campsite at mile 2119.5

I had the most beautiful campsite last night, on the shore peninsula of Jo-Mary Lake. I had been leapfrogging with a woman who had through hiked the AT several years ago and is now hiking just the Hundred Mile Wilderness, and she showed up at the campsite just as the sun was setting. We went for a swim (thankfully no leeches in this lake) and then had dinner. This morning I woke to a beautiful sunrise, got packed up and headed out for a long day's hiking. Much of the early day trail ran along rivers, and the roots and rocks tripped me repeatedly. The latter part of the day's trails was along a series of ponds and lakes, and the brilliant sunshine and blue water made for some nice scenery. The day's big climb was up and over Nesuntabunt Mountain, where I ran into the Italian father-and-son team unfortunately headed the wrong way after visiting a view spot. The son is finishing his through hike (he started his hike on the same day as me; however, he didn't skip over any portion, so he is about 600 miles ahead of me) and the father flew over from Rome to do the last one hundred miles with him. While they converse with each other in Italian, it is clear that there is a steady amount of friction between the two of them, and the revelation that they were headed south instead of north started quite a skein of heated language.
Tomorrow is my final day in the wilderness. The Baxter State Park has a love-hate relationship with the Appalachian Trail, which terminates on the peak of Mt Katahdin within the park, and has imposed stringent rules as to sheltering and duration of stay hikers can spend in the park. It is quite possible that I might have to spend several days just outside the park until a spot opens up for me in the queue to climb Mt Katahdin.","The Antlers campsite, mile 2139.1

Final day in the wilderness. Tough day hiking through the roots, boulders, and more roots. Passed several beautiful lakes, where the loons were in full loon mode. Saw another grouse with her chick today; it amazes me how tolerant they are of passing hikers. Saw an elderly Amish woman hiking on her own with a massively large backpack -- she was in a full dress and headwear. Tomorrow I will check in with the Baxter Park rangers to see if I get a place in the Katahdin queue -- apparently the through hiker quota is twelve per day. Heavy rainfall is forecast for tomorrow; I am hopeful that the forecast for Sunday will be more favorable.
Apollo 11 trivia, continued: Neil Armstrong was a graduate of Purdue University and was offered a position in the engineering school after the space flight; however, he chose not to take it, believing that others more qualified should be considered. He did, however, accept a teaching position at the University of Cincinnati, and taught there for several years.","stealth campsite at Pollywog Stream, mile 2158.3

The heavy overnight rain subsided just after I got the last of my gear packed up this morning. I had about a mile walk to the Golden Road at Abol Bridge, where I stopped in for breakfast and the day's hiking victuals. While there I ran into Ninja, the former through hiker with whom I had hiked for several days in the Hundred Mile Wilderness. She was going on a rafting trip down the Penobscot River tomorrow, and managed to complete her wilderness hike one day early.
After breakfast I needed to sign up for a spot at the Birches, the shelter that Baxter has allocated for northbound through hikers. Since they limit the number of spots to twelve, there is a big morning rush to get on the sign up sheet at the park entrance early. Fortunately I got there early enough, so my Katahdin hike tomorrow should work out as scheduled. The hike up to the Birches shelter was a little over nine miles, most of it along several beautiful roaring rivers. There were a couple of fords necessary, and one gave me a dunking that soaked me pretty good. I got to the shelter around noon, snagged the only tent site (I much prefer tenting to sleeping in a shelter), and squeezed in a nap in my otherwise full afternoon schedule. 
Tomorrow morning I am hoping to get an early start on the Katahdin climb -- four thousand feet of elevation gain, much of it involving scrambling over large boulders -- I am grateful that tomorrow's weather forecast looks favorable. The park provides daypacks for the climb; fortunately I can leave my heavy backpack and gear at the park office. Almost everyone else here will be finishing their through hikes tomorrow -- I am exceeding jealous of their accomplishments, as well as their post-hike pack-free freedoms.

I woke up early with the nervous anticipation of a seven year old on Christmas morning -- Katahdin is considered to be be the toughest climb on the trail. I was grateful for the clear and dry weather, which would make for good views and dry granite. The trail to the top of Katahdin is only about five miles, but the climb is over four thousand feet, which means a very steep gradient at points. The first portion of the trail was smooth and moderate, along a beautiful stream with rapids. After about a mile we reached the waterfalls, and the trail left the river and the boulder climbing commenced. The gradient increased in the next mile until the seriously steep rock scrambling began, and the cliffs and dropoffs became a pressing issue. Fortunately for me the potential horrific injuries never occurred, and the scrambling gave way to a long steep climb up a boulder-strewn ridgeline, and then a longer flatter section that led to the summit. The clouds and fog crept in on the final push, but gave way once I left the summit after picture-taking at the famous Katahdin sign. On the way down I passed a number of through hikers with whom I had been leapfrogging the last few days, including TrackMaker, a German fellow I had run into in Hot Springs NC, Gorham NH, the Hundred Mile Wilderness, and finally on the Katahdin summit. The descent was not as difficult as expected, although I think I may have developed some callouses on my butt from much butt-sliding on the steeper sections. After I reached the trail's end I managed to get a lift from a Portland couple who had been camping at Daicey Pond -- poor people had to put up with the Hundred Mile hiker stench for the twenty five mile drive into Millinocket ME -- thank you very much for your gracious help. Tomorrow I pick up my rental car in Bangor and head south to restart my hike in Virginia. I hope the rest of the hike will match the beauty and solitude of what I have been able to experience in New Hampshire and especially Maine.","The Birches shelter, mile 2185.7

I am back in Virginia after finishing up the northern portion of my hike.- Beautiful drive down from Maine the last two days. Terrific thunderstorms all afternoon yesterday. I was glad to be in a car and not on the trail during those storms.-When is trail magic not trail magic? I met up with my friend Brian in Fahnestock State Park yesterday morning on my way south, and had procured an assortment of doughnuts and coffee. We waited for about an hour for some hungry hikers to come through, but none appeared -- the hiker bubble must be much farther north by now. I had to continue my drive south, and Brian had an appointment with a plumber, so he went home with a large surplus of morning confectioneries.- I restarted the trail in Danville VA this afternoon where I had left off in June. The trail is hilly but not rocky and rooted like in Maine and New Hampshire. Nice weather and cooler temperatures made the hike very enjoyable. - The crowds have all disappeared: I saw only three other hikers today, with what appeared to be an average age of seventy five or so.- I had my first ""Superman fall"" today: I was traveling downhill, caught my toe on a rock and went sailing forward. Fortunately the trail was hardpacked dirt and the damage was minimal. 
Apollo 11 trivia, continued: In order to economize on fuel, the mission used what is known as ""free return"" to propel the spaceship between the earth and the moon. The principle uses the gravity of the earth or moon to act as a slingshot, and is accomplished by sending the space vehicle into a higher orbit, and then having it pass very closely to the earth or moon. As it passes by it accelerates rapidly due to gravitational forces. However, small calculation errors could have been catastrophic: either a crash into the orbited body, or lost forever in the depths of space."," Daleville VA, mile 729.2

- I saw very few people today: two southbound backpackers, two northbound dayhikers, and a young woman skinnydipping in the river.- The trail continues to be smooth and well groomed -- it is much easier to hike longer miles here than in the north.- The weather is heating up. This morning was chilly and windy; by the afternoon it had gotten hot. Temperatures are forecast to be in the nineties by the weekend, and the hot weather is expected to linger for awhile.- Water is becoming a problem. Many of the streams have dried up, and the remaining ones have low flow. I suspect that these conditions will continue for the remainder of the hike.-The shelter I am staying at this evening is very nice: two levels, with a large porch, right on a stream. Both last night and tonight I have been the only person at the shelters.- Tomorrow will be a big climbing day: three thousand feet right at the start, and then a number of ascents and descents throughout the day. Hopefully they won't be as tough as the Whites.- The day length is noticeably shorter than in Maine: here it begins to get light just before 6am; in Maine it started just after 4am.

Another beautiful Virginia day, with sunshine and a nice breeze for much of the day. The morning was spent climbing up a number of hills until I reached Apple Orchard Mountain, where there is a FAA radar installation. After that the trail followed a ridgeline that had scenic views of the Shenandoah Valley. Much of the rest of the day was short ascents and descents. Late in the day I found a beautiful open campsite near a spring, and was joined by a southbound flip flopper who had started her hike at Harpers Ferry and had completed her northern section earlier. It was fun to chat with her and compare respective experiences with the northern terrain and trail.
Tomorrow I am planning a near-o to Glasgow VA, an apparently one road / one horse town, in order to get resupplied via Dollar General for the next leg which will take me to the southern boundary of Shenandoah National Park.

Highly variable weather here today: hot and muggy to impending thunderstorms to high winds to no thunderstorm to fog to high winds to hot and muggy again. Tomorrow is supposed to be hotter and muggier still, with thunderstorms coming at the end of the week.
Today's trail had lots of climbs; however, the condition of the trail was smooth and well-graded, which made the miles hike themselves, at least figuratively. Big climbs in morning tomorrow and then a bunch of senseless up and downs the rest of the day.
I saw only four other hikers the whole day today, and none after 2pm. One of the downsides of not seeing others is that I end up hiking through endless spiders' webs. I end with so much filament that I could probably spin some silk in my spare time.
I spent yesterday in Glasgow VA, a blink-and-you-miss-it town. The usual pickup trucks with the Confederate flag decal on the back window -- the news of the South's defeat in the American Civil War must not have reached Glasgow yet -- but the hostel was quite nice, and the breakfast they served me this morning was most delicious.
Apollo 11 trivia, continued: The Saturn rocket that flew the astronauts into space weighed six million pounds. The five engines in the first stage could product 1.5 million pounds of thrust each. The launchpad had hold-down mechanisms to hold the rocket in place until the engines could reach proper thrust: that way the mission controllers could prevent the rocket from lifting off if there were a problem with one or more of the engines. The astronauts felt that the first thirty seconds of the mission would be the most dangerous, since there would be little chance to escape if a catastrophic event occurred."," US 501, mile 786.0

I was fortunate: both Cate Blanchett and Elvis Costello made cameo appearances in my dream last night. Perhaps with a little prodding I could get them to join me on the trail for a day or two. Today's weather was hot and very humid, with thunder in the distance all afternoon. The trail was rockier today, with constant ascents and descents all day. I stopped to camp at a rock formation called Spy Rock, which had a very challenging rock scramble and beautiful views of the line of mountains in the distance and the setting sun. I was doubly fortunate: while hiking over one of the balds I came within a stride of stepping on a timber rattler. He curled up into a defensive position, I walked around him, he wished me a good day and a safe hike, and I thanked him for his discretion and courtesy. Apparently snakes are an issue for the duration of the hike; I will be extra careful to pay attention to where I am placing my feet henceforth. Today I passed the ""fewer than 500 miles to go"" milestone. Current indications point to a completion date of the first weekend in October.

Then the hard part of the day started. I had a brief climb up to the summit of the Priest Mountain, then down a three thousand foot slope to a road and a river, and then a tough climb back up three thousand feet to the summit of Three Ridges Mountain. All in 90 degree heat and humidity.
Lots of flowers, bees and butterflies today. A trail runner warned me that there was a copperhead rattler on the trail below me, but I missed him.

I had a splendid time in Waynesboro for my near-o and zero. Waynesboro is named for the American Revolutionary War General ""Mad"" Anthony Wayne, who earned his nickname during a daring night time bayonet attack on the British at the Battle of Stony Point, about fifteen miles south of West Point on the Hudson River, and coincidentally about ten miles south of Anthony Wayne State Park, where we often hike. Fort Wayne, Waynesboro PA, and Wayne State University in Detroit are also named after him. The man appears to have gotten around quite a bit.
Weather today was quite variable: foggy to very hot and humid to thunderstorms in the distance to thunderstorms in close proximity to a light steady rain back to very hot and humid. Humping up the hills in the heat just makes me hope that when death comes it comes quickly.
Much of the trail today was between 2500' and 3500' in elevation, generally with rather smooth trails, and multiple crossings of the Blue Ridge Parkway.

Today was a long slog up and down hills -- the terrain is getting more challenging as the trail heads north through the park. The morning was hot and humid, but we had a good rainstorm at noon for an hour or so which cooled things off for a bit. We got another rain shower in the late afternoon, then diffuse sunshine.

Yesterday's hike ended with a lightning storm and a long search for an adequate campsite, which I found near a spring at the top of a long hill climb. The area had very dense thickets that were almost impenetrable. The Union army lost the Battle of the Wilderness during the Civil War in an area with similar coverage -- they got trapped, couldn't cut their way through, and the Confederates started fires that burned up a portion of the Union army.
The rain last night cooled off the morning -- we had fog up until mid-morning. The bushes on the trail verge were untrimmed and very wet -- I felt like a car going through a car wash at times. The day heated up eventually, but the forecast is rain and cooler temperatures for the next few days.
The trail ran through an area called the Roller Coaster, a tightly grouped series of steep hills over approximately fifteen miles. The heat, the hills and the bugs conspired to make it a long day. Just before I reached the hostel where I am staying, I had a rattlesnake in the trail that simply did not want to move. Fortunately my hiking poles prodded him in a convincing manner and he surrendered the way.

I woke up to heavy rain this morning, and no amount of lying in bed moaning would stop the downpour. I packed up my tent and gear with one hand and used my other to shake my fist at the vengeful gods.
I had a short hike to Harpers Ferry, where the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers meet. With all the rain they were threatening to spill over the riverbanks. Harpers Ferry is a charming little town with lots of important history, and it was fun to walk around and explore. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy has an office there, and in addition to selling trail paraphernalia, also collate an annual volume of through hiker pictures (taken on their front porch) and information. When I was there I ran into Rizz, a New Yorker with whom I had leapfrogged repeatedly in Maine -- we ended up summiting Katahdin on the same day, and took the same bus from Millinocket to Bangor -- he is continuing south from Harpers Ferry to Springer Mountain. Harpers Ferry is the most popular endpoint for those doing flip flop hikes -- there were a number of them at the Conservatory office while I was there.
After that I had a delicious lunch and then headed across the river, along the C&O towpath trail and then up the hill into the Maryland wilderness. The rain abated in the afternoon for awhile -- just a heavy foggy haze -- before it restarted just before dusk.
This area was an important field of battle during the American Civil War. In 1862 Lee had won an important battle at Second Bull Run, and decided to invade the north, partly to take the pressure off of the southern farmers, but also because he thought, incorrectly, that he would get a warm welcome in Maryland, a border state but also a slave-owning state. Lincoln had fired his chief general and replaced him with George McClellan, who had been a chief general previously -- a not very successful one -- but Lincoln was desperate. One of McClellan's subordinates found some written orders from Lee wrapped in some cigars that detailed Lee's plan to split up his army into four groups and have them fight separate independent battles in Maryland. Armed with these plans, McClellan could have easily wiped out each of these groups one by one and ended the war; however he dawdled, fought several minor battles in this area, and let Lee regroup his main forces at Antietam Creek, where eventually McClellan attacked Lee's full force. The result was a draw but incurred the highest one day number of casualties in any war America has fought -- something on the order of 21,000 men killed or wounded on one day. The outcome was that Lee was able to slip away unhindered and move his forces south of the Potomac to fight another day. The next year Lee tried the same strategy and had less success at Gettysburg, but was still able to move his forces back south over the Potomac largely unhindered. It was not until Grant became general in chief that battles were aggressively followed up with relentless pursuits.

I plan to come back to spend more time in this area at some point: very beautiful scenery and dramatic history. The trail today alternated between muddy woods roads and hellishly slippery granite rock piles. Apparently much of the trail in eastern Pennsylvania has flat but agonizingly rocky terrain, and today was most likely a prelude to the frustration I will have when I reach that point.

Gray foggy morning turned into a bright sunshine afternoon, and the trail was generally smooth and well-graded. I was, however, cursing the short slick rock scramble when I heard, ""Hey lightisgreen!"" It was Lars, a fellow New Yorker with whom we first met at the Hiker Hostel in Rangeley ME and then in a torrential downpour in the White Mountains. He had been hiking southbound with fellow hiker Calgary but took time off when he reached New York and is now about a week behind. It was great catching up, and we joked that we will undoubtedly run into each other in the city next. He did ask me to convey his thanks to my friend Brian, who managed to serve up some trail magic at Graymoor Monastery when Lars was passing through.","tenting at Tumbling Run shelter, mile 1074.0

Yet another splendid day on the trail, although the day started off with rain and ended up being gray and cloudy all day.
- Trail magic just before the State Park: I snagged the last diet soda left out by some generous resident.- Trail magic in the State Park: The guidebook said that the general store / restaurant is only open on weekends after Labor Day. That information turned out to be incorrect: I was served a very delicious cheeseburger and fries. Yum!- The State Park also houses the AT Museum, which had very interesting exhibits on the history and people behind the trail genesis and development.- I was the only person at the shelter last night -- very spooky. It rained very hard last night, so I set my tent up on the shelter porch under an eave. I was very grateful to be able to pack up a dry tent this morning.- I had very intense dreams last night, and a number of famous celebrities madr cameo appearances: Daniel Craig showed up to a party I was hosting, although apparently uninvited; Pat Metheny needed me to drive him to the airport; and David Bowie played me a new song he had written. I was grateful that they all could take time out of their undoubtedly busy days to stop by. Also, I was hired to tutor a Brazilian girl, even though I don't speak Portuguese, and I scratched a neighbor's car when opening my car door. These things happen.
Apollo 11 trivia, continued: The moon surface is composed of very fine powdery soil. After Armstrong and Aldrin transferred to the command module, the dust residue from their suits got into everything, and they were tasting grit for the rest of the mission.","tenting at Birch Run shelter, mile 1093.6

I traveled through the Cumberland Valley today -- lots of cornfields, muddy trails but thankfully few hills. A cloudy morning turned into beautiful afternoon sunshine. Boiling Springs is a very cute little town with a lake in the middle filled with ducks feeding on the water plants. I met a gentleman there who had through hiked the trail in 1989 during his gap year between high school and college. He confirmed that the packs then were huge and heavy, and that logistics were challenging without cell phones and the internet. Staying at a motel in Carlisle tonight. The word on the trail is that the rocks start tomorrow and the trail, while flat for long periods, is strewn with sharp rocks that are challenging to hike through.","stealth campsite, mile 1114.6

Gorgeous day for a hike. I spent last night in a motel in Carlisle: clean sheets on the bed and pretty pictures on the wall. Tragedy: the guidebook cited an Indian restaurant adjacent to the restaurant, but it had closed permanently in the interim. Its sign was still up so I held a short vigil outside the building before moving on to the diner. One delicious lamb gyro, a bottomless glass of diet soda, and a pint of Ben & Jerry's and I was a new man. Today I slept in, then checked out of my room, had another lamb gyro and bottomless glass of diet soda and then restarted the trail. The first half of the day was spent in the flat section of the Cumberland Valley, and then a climb up to the ridgeline of the hills that run to the northeast. The rocky sections have started, and will continue until the Delaware Water Gap. Lots of dayhikers, a few southbounders, and a bunch of deer. A surprising amount of gunfire in the distance, and surprisingly few squirrels: I wonder if the locals were rustling up breakfast.

- Foggy morning turned into a very wet and windy afternoon as Hurricane Florence passed through. The forecast called for an inch and a half of rain and I think we got at least that much, plus some very high winds.- I stopped in Duncannon for lunch but passed on the famous Doyle Hotel. It was originally an Anheuser Busch hotel built in the 1880s but apparently never renovated since. I was told that the food was okay but on no condition should I consider staying at the hotel; duly noted, I decided to spend my tourist dollars elsewhere on a pizza and ice cream. Money well spent. Yum!- The trail runs through Duncannon, a town that reminded me of Newburgh NY -- very poor and not well kept up. It's a shame since the trail towns in the south were much more hospitable, with numerous restaurants and hostels. Duncannon is on the Susquehanna River, but has a freight line and interstate highway blocking access to the river. It felt like walking through a cemetery.- The trail was quite rocky on both sides of the town, but smoothed out nicely after a few miles. Walking on the steep wet rocks in the pouring rain was challenging.- Last night I stayed at the Cove Mountain shelter with a local section hiker. We built a nice campfire and talked for a long time about various hiking trips we've taken. In the night the falling hickory nuts hitting the shelter roof sounded like gunfire -- I'm glad I was sleeping in my tent.- When I reached my shelter tonight there was an odd but friendly man there who had made a visit to clean up the shelter and leave some drinking water and ramen noodles. He was dressed in camouflage hiking clothes and had a big holstered gun and knife on his belt. I thanked him for his generosity but I felt much more comfortable once he said goodbye and departed."," tenting at Cove Mountain shelter, mile 1144.3

The vestiges of Hurricane Florence blew through yesterday afternoon to this morning, and even at this last stage it dumped a tremendous amount of rain. I woke up to high winds and a steady downpour, both of which lasted through mid-morning.
- The storm finally moved on and the afternoon was clear, bright and sunny.- The trail was relatively flat but the drainage was very poor, and I must have slopped through at least two hundred deep puddles of mud and water. My feet have not been in dry shoes and socks since Virginia.- I only saw three hikers all day: two section hikers in the morning and one southbound through hiker in the afternoon. The through hiker seemed rather sad when I told him I had fewer than one hundred fifty miles; he still has twelve hundred miles to Springer Mountain.- I am camped next to a raging river this evening. I wonder if I will be dreaming of kayaking and rafting tonight.","Peters Mountain shelter, mile 1159.3

Gloriously brilliant sunshine after so many rainy days. The trail is starting to get very rocky, and the word on the street is that it just gets worse and worse going north until the Delaware Water Gap. The final several miles of today's hike had beautiful views of the Swatara Valley, and ragged limestone cliffs. The shelter I am staying at tonight is close enough to the road to facilitate pizza ordering, and now I am full and happy.

I woke up with a sore back and a surly attitude; the back improved during the day but the bad attitude lingered. A cool gray day, muddy poorly maintained trail, others' rudeness and poor service combined to generate a less-than-fully-gruntled outlook. Tomorrow will be a short day; let's hope the near-o in Port Clinton works its magic.
The 501 shelter is one of the nicest shelters on the trail. It has a caretaker who lives nearby so the place is clean and very well-maintained. It also has a solar shower, is fully enclosed, and best of all it has a very large octagon-shaped skylight in its roof-center, above several dining tables. 
I passed at least twenty through hikers yesterday, but only four today. The weather is getting much cooler -- I am glad that I am nearing the end of my hike and not with another twelve hundred left to go!
Apollo 11 trivia, continued: The moonwalk almost did not happen. NASA redesigned the life-support backpack but failed to enlarge the hatchway exit. Armstrong and Aldrin had to maneuver in uncomfortable positions in order to get through the exit."," 501 shelter, mile 1194.8

A near-o today for me for a food resupply. I am staying in Port Clinton, at the Port Clinton Hotel, where I have a comfortable room and enjoyed a delicious lunch. Central Pennsylvania is Trump country; I suspect that the residents here benefitted from the billionaires' tax cut and just do a terrific job of hiding their wealth.
The hospitality amenities vary greatly along the trail; however, I am impressed that the hotel here does a very nice job at treating through hikers very well.
Tomorrow starts the final phase of my through hike: one hundred more rocky miles and an expected completion date of Sunday September 30th at the Delaware Water Gap. We're planning to have a shindig there in the afternoon to celebrate -- keep an eye out for your invitation to join in.
Today is the final day of summer. I simply don't know where the time went.","stealth campsite near Shartlesville - Cross Mountain Road, mile 1211.9

""Leaves are falling all around / Time I was on my way."" 
Happy Autumnal Equinox! Just where did the summer go? The trees are shedding their leaves in bulk now, and it looks like someone has been dropping yellow paint blotches on the trail.
Today started out warm and sunny but turned cold, gray and windy as the day progressed. I had a very nice stay in Port Clinton, and the hike out of town followed a gentle river before heading up into the hills. I saw very few through hikers but multitudes of dayhikers, many of whom wanted to hear details of my trip. Very flattering. The trail followed several ridgelines, each with an interesting rock formation and overlook. I ended the day at Dan's Pulpit, where the seriously difficult bouldering commences. They don't call it ""Rocksylvania"" for nothing!"," Port Clinton, mile 1218.9

The trail got progressively more rocky as the day wore on, and the Knife Edge and Bake Oven Knob were as tough as some of the formations in New Hampshire. It stayed cool and cloudy all day today, so no problems with the bugs and no fears of the rattlesnakes.
I stopped in at the Blue Mountain Summit restaurant for a delicious lunch and bottomless glass of diet soda. I gave a thought to staying at their B&B for the night; however, they did not have wifi so I pressed on with the day. Rain is in the forecast for the next few days, so it will be a battle with slick wet rocks for the duration of the Pennsylvania portion of the trail.
Note from yesterday: There was a porcupine heading down the trail in my direction in the late afternoon. He either had poor eyesight or had a great deal of porcupine thoughts going on, because he got almost to my feet before he saw me and turned around to defend himself. Once he saw that I was not going to challenge him, he sauntered up a nearby tree and I went on my way.","tenting at Dan's Pulpit, mile 1236.7

Big climb today out of the Lehigh Gap: one thousand feet straight up, a mix of New Hampshire and Breakneck Ridge: a misplaced handhold or foot placement could send someone back down to the starting point.The town of Palmerton had a zinc smelting plant for many years, the fumes from which toxified the surrounding mountains to the point where nothing would grow there. A few billion dollars of Superfund money made for some very elegant landscaping through which to hike today. The rest of the trail was rocky in places, with sharp rocks that would poke through the boot sole or catch a toe. There were several places where the trail went through large boulder fields, but far fewer than I had braced myself for.Heavy rain in the forecast for tonight and tomorrow. Hopefully the brilliant sunshine and warm temperatures return for my final few days on the trail.","tenting at Bake Oven Knob shelter 1251.1

lightisgreen,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604008,"PA / NJ: Delaware Water GapThe foggy morning finally burned off and we got several hours of hot brilliant sunshine before the thunderstorm clouds blew in. Fortunately I made it to my motel in the Delaware Water Gap and picked up my pizza and diet soda before the storm started. Due to my celerity, I am now several days ahead of schedule, and I will be taking two zeros before restarting the trail southbound from Branchville NJ back to the Water Gap. Two more days on the trail and my through hike will be competed!
Note from yesterday: I took a break from the huge downpour and stopped in at the Leroy Smith shelter to warm up, and was joined by two other hikers: a father who was several years older than me and his son. They had started the trail together in Maine but the father burned out in the Hundred Mile Wilderness, and now joins his son for short sections. They made me a cup of tea and I shared a bag of banana chips, and we shared anecdotes while waiting for the the storm to pass.
I am now done with Pennsylvania -- thirteen states down and a small portion of one left. The rocks were annoying but certainly oversold in terms of their negative effect. The biggest problems were the large rock formations that would stretch on for a half mile or so, and involve sharp boulders and steep cliffs; everything else was just nuisance.

A wonderful day, an amazing journey.
Brian and I got up and packed and headed to the AMC Mohican Outdoor Center, where we ate a very delicious breakfast and waited for our friends who would be joining us for my final day of through hiking. At breakfast we talked with a number of section hikers, and the answer to almost every question was, ""Today. Today is the final day of my through hike."" My friends and daughter finally showed up, and after picture-taking we headed to the trailhead and started south. The trail was surprisingly rocky for the first half of the day, but also very beautiful, with scenic views of the Delaware River and Sunfish Pond, which is a glacial moraine. The last portion of the trail was on a woods road, and we spotted a timber rattlesnake slithering in the underbrush adjacent to the trail. We concluded the hike with a delicious dinner and drinks at a brewpub in Blairstown, and with that and many hugs and thanks, my six month adventure came to an end.
I am deeply indebted to everyone whose generosity made my trip so special. Brian, who provided transportation and logistical support; Dave & Melody, and Ed, who provided automobile storage; Patrizia, Bill, Brian, Pravir, Irtaza, Judy, and Becky, who were endlessly entertaining fellow slackpackers; and especially my daughter Annie, who managed my trail journal and offered sublime enthusiasm and advice.
